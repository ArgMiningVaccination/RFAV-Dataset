In the DBM, the laboratories of the former \"pre-clinical institutes\" as well as the clinical divi- sions of the University Hospitals are united under a common leadership with the goal to channel their efforts and to strive for excellence in biomedical research. In the 13 years since the department was founded, we enjoyed continuous growth and fl ourishing of our research. By providing a bridge between basic science and clinical medicine, the DBM is an important com-ponent in the University of Basel's strategic plan for the Life Sciences. The DBM concentrates on research in four focal areas: Oncology, Immunology, Neurobiology, and Stem Cells/Regenerative Medicine. DBM's research groups obtain a large proportion of their research funds from competitive grants by national foundations, the EU and other coun-tries. More than 60% of the positions are funded by third parties. The DBM has attracted individual grants as well as synergy grants from the European Research Council (ERC), the Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology (SystemsX. ch) and the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF). In 2010, Roche and the University of Basel with the University Hospital have initiated the \"Basel Translational Medicine Hub\". This Innovation Fund brings together expertise from academia and industry, and fosters tight bonds between basic and clini-cal research. In 2012, Markus Heim, research group leader at the DBM received the pres- tigious Otto Naegeli Prize for the promotion of medical research. The prize is awarded every two years and is considered one of the highest national hon-ors. Michael Sinnreich received the Robert-Bing-Prize 2012. The National Research Council of the SNSF recently elected Rolf Zeller as a new member, where he will join Markus Heim and Marc Donath, both also from the DBM. In 2013, Daniela Finke and Radek Skoda were elected members of Swiss Academy of Medical Sciences (SAMS). This report summarizes the activities of meanwhile over 60 DBM research groups during the period of 2011-2013. The reports are grouped themati- cally according to the four focal areas. Each research group has selected their most relevant publications from this period. A complete list of all publications can be found in the annex of this report. The DBM and our research groups are regularly evaluated by the Scienti c Advisory Board that consists of eight internationally recognized experts. During their yearly visits, the Advisory Board members evaluate and make recommendations on how to improve the organization of the department. They also provide an important basis for decisions, including promotions and changes in future directions. Laboratory Prefacespace remains a major problem, but in January 2014, the DBM will gain ac- cess to new laboratories on the 2nd fl oor of the DBM-Hebelstrasse, where the former medical library has been converted to lab space. We are looking forward to this much-needed expansion. Key to the success of the DBM has been the enthusiasm of our scientists and clinicians from over 40 countries to communicate and to perform inter- and trans-disciplinary work resulting in benchmark biomedical research. The research is supported by a growing number of Core Facilities. While some Core Facilities are for the DBM only, others are joint ventures between our department with the Biozentrum (Faculty of Natural Sciences) and also the D-BSSE Institute of the ETH Z\u00fcrich in Basel. The access to these key tech-nologies is of immeasurable value to us. As a token of our esteem, we portray the core facilities in the current report. The DBM is committed to the highest quality and innovation in research. I hope that this report will facilitate the exchange of information and interac- tions with our research groups and I wish you pleasant reading.

As centralized shared resources, they provide all researchers easy access to instrumentation, technology, and expert know-how. The highly trained facil-ity managers are keeping up with the latest technological advances in order to serve the evolving needs of the research community. DBM members have in-house access to core facilities for Bioinformatics, Flow Cytometry & Cell Sorting, and Microscopy and access to core facilities jointly operated with other research institutions including Quantitative Ge-nomics Facility (for next generation sequencing), the Life Sciences Training Facility (for gene expression pro ling), the Center for (Electron) Microscopy, the Transgenic Mouse Core Facility, and the Small Animal Facility for Nuclear Molecular Imaging. DBM core facilities are unique in that they provide their service at no or very little costs. They are continually implementing the latest developments to better serve the DBM scienti c community. As such they have a central role in creating a competitive research environment and contribute signi cantly to the scienti c success of the Department of Biomedicine.Core Facilities of the Department of resource of exper- tise in computational biology and statistics, available to all researchers at the DBM. It offers services for analysis and visualization of large-scale biological data produced by high-throughput genomics experiments. The platform also provides training in bioinformatics and facilitates access to high-performance computational resources. Design and analysis of the high-throughput biological data sets One of the goals is to implement solutions for analysis, visualization, man-agement and interpretation of large-scale genomic data generated by high-throughput techniques (microarrays and next generation sequencing) both in human and in model organisms. Over the rst 18 months, the Bioinformat-ics Core Facility analyzed data from more than 30 studies from 16 research groups: 22 studies of gene expression, 11 DNA-protein binding (ChIP-, CLIP-seq), 1 DNA methylation study, 2 studies on detailed mapping of physi-cal contacts between genomic elements (4c-seq), and 2 projects focused on identi cation of sequence variants. Beside the standardized approaches, the platform also develops customized solutions tailored towards the needs of individual research projects. Bioinformatics training The facility also provides regular bioinformatics training. Together with bio-informaticians from the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research we organize \" R Introductory Course\". This ve-day practical course provides beginners with basic knowledge of the R software environment and with training on how to explore and visualize the data and perform wide range of statistical tests. Already 20 PhD students and Post-docs from the DBM attended this course in fall 2012 and in spring 2013 where they learned how to analyze their own data with R software. Infrastructure The platform's mission is to build and maintain an infrastructure that enables application of strong bioinformatics analysis to enhance and empower the biomedical research at the DBM. However, the rapid technological advances as well as the growing number of bioinformatics approaches and tools make it dif cult to keep track of with limited resources at the facility. Therefore, the Bioinformatics Core Facility closely interacts with other bioinformatics units in the Basel area, namely with the group of Dr. Michael Stadler (Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research) and the group of Prof. Torsten Schwede (Basel Computational Biology Center - [BC] 2, Swiss Institute of Bio- informatics) in order to implement the latest bioinformatics approaches. By joining the [BC] 2 in 2012, all researchers of the DBM got access to its high- performance computing cluster. In 2013, Dr. Ivanek became a member of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Flow Cyto- is a laser-based technology with which cell mixtures can be analyzed, counted and separated. The technology is based on light scatter-ing and fl uorescence characteristics of individual cells or other microscopic particles as they fl ow through a laser beam. Analyses of fl uorescence mark- ers, cell size and shape are routinely used to identify speci c cell types. Cell populations cannot only be analyzed, but cells of interest can also be re-trieved for further investigations. Sorting cells by fl ow cytometry has become a standard method used by DBM researchers from all focal areas, including applications in immunology, oncology, neurobiology, and stem cell biology. In medicine, the applications cover transplantation, hematology, tumor im-munology and chemotherapy or prenatal diagnosis. Service The DBM Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core Facility provides instrumen-tation, technical support and methodological assistance for a wide range of applications using fl ow cytometry for analysis and sorting of cell populations. We offer free-of-charge access to the most advanced technology and to a well-maintained equipment park to all DBM researchers, helping them to rapidly advance in their projects. Our facility is divided into two sections: (i) the Cytometry Unit, to which researchers have full access after a manda-tory introductory training; (ii) the Sorting Unit, which is equipped with mod-ern cell sorters and where our expert staff provides a full service in cell and particle sorting. We train researchers in basic and advanced handling of the equipment, and provide expert support on data acquisition and analysis. We also organize seminars on technological advances in cytometry and related Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core Facility aims at continually im- proving quality and capacity of their equipment and services. Our goal is to develop novel methods and keep up with technological advances in the eld, e.g. by increasing throughput and sensitivity or by combining fl ow microscopy has revolutionized modern biology by creating a window for researchers to \"see\" the cellular and molecular world. The DBM Micros-copy Facility enables researchers with limited microscopy knowledge to be- come experts and it allows experts to do creative experiments. With over 100 introductions last year, a common use of the facility is training new users. Basic training is one-to-one and it begins with sample prepara-tion, probe choice, demonstration and discussion. This is followed by hands-on experience at the microscope, and learning how to acquire a good image. Users nally convert their images into meaningful data through computer assisted image analysis and quanti cation.The facility also invests in technological development. Two major questions in modern microscopy are: How small can we image and how much can we image? Towards answering the rst question, single molecule imaging with quantum dots was recently implemented. This nano technique allows the observation of movement of individual proteins in live cells. Towards an-swering the second question, we have installed an Operetta microscope that brings the power of high content screening to DBM research and discovery.Advanced techniques such as super resolution microscopy, single molecule tracking, calcium imaging, FRAP, FRET, live cell imaging, slide scanning, high content screening and many more have been developed, implemented, and regularly executed at the DBM. Two facilities - unique service The DBM currently holds two microscopy facilities located at Hebelstrasse and at Mattenstrasse. Both facilities are used free of charge and there are a total of 17 microscopes, including four confocals, two stereomicroscopes, many different wide- eld systems for live and xed-cell or time-lapse mi-croscopy, a laser dissection microscope, and a high content screening micro-scope. For image analysis we have Imaris, Huygens, Nikon, Zeiss, Olympus, Leica, Metamorph, and more software licenses. We also support freeware, particularly ImageJ. All the academic microscopy facilities in Basel form an interactive network called the Basel Microscopy Network (BMN, http://microscopynetwork. unibas.ch), composed of the DBM, and FMI facilities. This facilitates exchange, fosters collaborations, and provides a wide net of microscopy possibilities across the Basel academic landscape. Our outlook is to continue raising the basic level of microscopy at the DBM while also extending the frontiers of what is possible in super-resolution mi-croscopy. We are developing microscopy courses in house and in the Basel area in collaboration with the BMN, and also invite speakers and companies to showcase the latest technology to our DBM researchers. Life Science Training Facility (LSTF) Prof. Dr. Andreas Papassotriopoulos andreas.papas@unibas.ch Life Science Training FacilityDivision of Molecular PsychologyMissionsstrasse 60/62, 4055 BaselSwitzerland The Life Sciences Training Facility (LSTF) provides access to microarray and deep-sequencing technologies and contributes to the identi cation of novel molecular pathways in health and disease. The facility is primarily open to research groups af liated with the University (e.g. Department of Biomedi- cine, Biozentrum, University Hospital), but it also collaborates with external groups. The LSTF implements technologies dedicated to the analysis and/or quanti cation of DNA and RNA including DNA/RNA microarrays and genome-wide SNP genotyping, real-time PCR, Pyrosequencing, and library preparation for next generation sequencing. Service, teaching and research The LSTF, which is embedded in the university's Division of Molecular Neu-roscience, is part of the Affymetrix Core Lab Program and is organized as a user-lab. Researchers receiving LSTF's services are tightly involved in all steps of their experiment since they perform the technical work themselves as well as the data analysis under our guidance and daily assistance. The fa-cility has developed standardized procedures, which t to the speci city of each project. The facility is dedicated to train young researchers at the bench through the organization of software training and courses associating theory and practice. To ef ciently analyze their data, researchers have free access to commercial software as well as free third-party software. Af liation and staff The LSTF is located in the Pharmazentum/Biozentrum and is funded by the major stakeholders (Department of Biomedicine, Biozentrum, Faculty of Psy-chology). The head of the university's Division of Molecular Neuroscience acts as the academic supervisor of the LSTF team, which is composed of one leading technical assistant, two technical assistants, and one scienti c assis-tant. Outlook While we will continue to provide access to microarray services, we will also increase our efforts related to next generation sequencing and, importantly, to the statistical interpretation of the data. In addition, we will launch a pro- gram for genome-wide epigenetic studies through collaboration with expert groups from the pharmaceutical industry. Joint Core Facilities22/23 Quantitative Genomics Facility Dr. Christian Beisel christian.beisel@bsse.ethz.ch Department Science Engineering 4058 BaselSwitzerland The Quantitative Genomics Facility (QGF) is a central research and service facility located in the Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering (D-BSSE) of the ETH Zurich in Basel. The unit is supported and run jointly with the University of Basel and the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI) for Bio- medical Research. QGF was established at D-BSSE in 2008 to allow research-ers of the life science community in Basel and at ETH Zurich direct access to next generation sequencing (NGS) technology, and thereby facilitating the systematic quantitative investigation of genome-wide experiments. The QGF team provides technical support for NGS applications in genomics and epigenomics, including high-throughput data management and analy-sis. Furthermore, has installed state-of-the-art PCR platforms to enable high-throughput validation of NGS data down to the single cell level and to allow the absolute quanti cation of nucleic acids. The facility benchtop sequencer and a HiSeq2000 sequencing system, accessory equipment for sample preparation and QC as well as the BioRad QX100 ddPCR sys-tems. While the operation of the NGS equipment is reserved for our trained technical staff the other preparative and analytical systems for sample prepa- ration and QC as well as for PCR measurements are accessible by the users directly. QGF is involved in grant-funded projects with research groups at DBM, Biozentrum and D-BSSE investigating the heterogeneous nature of tumour tissues as well as the developmental potential of mouse brain stem cells. An important new avenue in the genomics eld is the evolving possibility to per-form measurements in single cells for which we see great potential and es-tablish suitable workfl ows in our facility. On the other hand, increasing needs in clinical research with regard to disease diagnostics and identi cation of biomarkers will be met by setting up robotics workstations for automated sample preparation and increasing sequencing capacity.The growing impact of the sequencing service provided by QGF is refl ected in the numbers of sequenced samples. While in 2009 we sequenced 150 samples, in 2013 we have processed more than 3'000. We envisage that the requests for genomics applications in the elds of systems biology, biotech-nology and genetic diagnostics will further grow substantially, underlining the impact of QGF and its further development for the research in the Basel scienti c community.Small Animal Facility for Pre-clinical Nuclear Molecular Imaging Prof. Dr. Thomas L. Mindt thomas.mindt@usb.ch University Hospital BaselRadiopharmaceutical ChemistryPetersgraben 4, 4031 BaselSwitzerland In fall 2013, the Small Animal Facility of the Clinic of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine of the University Hospital Basel was put into operation. The facil-ity is designed to host up to 400 rats and mice for short and long-term ex- periments. It also comprises a SPECT/CT camera (NanoSPECT/CT; Bioscan) dedicated to small animal imaging as well as other equipment for the study of pharmacokinetic and -dynamic properties of radiolabeled compounds. The use of nuclear imaging modalities with its unique high sensitivity (detec- tion in the femtomole range) enables the study of molecules in a natural set-ting without interfering interactions such as receptor saturation effects. The facility provides a unique platform for translational research at the University of Basel. The Small Animal Facility is managed by the heads of the divisions of Radio- pharmaceutical Chemistry (DBM-associated Prof. Dr. T. Mindt) and Nuclear Medicine (Prof. Dr. Damian Wild).24/25 Transgenic Mouse Transgenic Mouse Core Facility (TMCF) of the University of Basel pro- vides research groups within the university access to transgenic and trans-genic related techniques. Service and set up The service offers the injection of conventional DNA and BAC constructs into the nuclei of fertilized oocytes of various mouse strains, and carries out the injection of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into blastocysts to gener-ate chimeras. As mouse line rederivation by embryo transfer has become increasingly important, TMCF supports the research groups in the handling of frozen or fresh mouse pre-implantation embryos, and is offering embryo cryopreservation including storage. The service also provides gene targeting of mouse ES cells and supports re-search groups with tested material and methods for ES cell work. In addition, it offers de novo rederivation of mouse ES cells and embryonic broblasts from transgenic mouse lines. The facility works closely with the researchers and provides technical support during their experiments. TMCF continuous-ly evaluates the technical needs and requirements in order to extend their services. The facility consists of an injection suite, a cryo-preservation and mouse embryo thawing work station, lab space for general mouse embryo work, animal rooms, and a lab to carry out surgical procedures, a molecular biology lab for quality control and sample preparation, a mouse stem cell lab, and a workstation for primary mouse cell culture. We aim to provide state-of-the art support for all applied techniques according to the need of the scienti c community. We strive to provide this support as informally and quickly as possible and to keep it as affordable as possible. Staff, af liation, and funding TMCF was founded on the initiative of scientists from the Biozentrum and the DBM, and consists of the head of facility and ve technical staff mem-bers, three of whom are employed part-time. The head of TMCF is newly supported by the TMCF scienti c head, Prof. Dr. Verdon Taylor. Staff mem- bers are funded by the Biozentrum, the University of Basel, and the DBM. Clients are charged part of the actual costs for the consumables for each ex-periment. The remaining expenses are covered by the university. Outlook TMCF continues to provide a tailored service for all research groups at the University of Basel including the development of new protocols and meth-ods in transgenic mouse technology. As of August 2013, part of the TMCF has been moved to the BioPark in the Rosental Areal. Center for The Center for Microscopy (ZMB) of the University of Basel provides elec- tron microscope equipment of every description for research group projects and also plays a key role in education. The service accepts microscopy com- missions from all disciplines in Life Sciences, Medicine and Natural Sciences, supporting the research groups in their projects. The ZMB also carries out its own research projects to develop and re ne methods of preparation, imag-ing techniques, and image processing software. The ZMB facilities comprise a preparation laboratory, three Transmission Electron Microscopes and three Scanning Electron Microscopes. We of-fer collaboration in imaging on electron microscopes either as 'full service', where the staff of ZMB is doing the imaging work, or by teaching users in how to operate electron microscopes on their own. Administration of the ZMB is integrated into the University of Basel's Biozen-trum. Professor Henning Stahlberg, head of the C-CINA, is currently the sci-enti c director of the ZMB and at the same time director of the ZMB Users' Board. The Board makes the strategic decisions in keeping up with state-of-the-art electron microscopy and making the necessary new methods avail-able to research.26/27 Sven Cichon, born 1966 in Frankfurt/Main, Germany, studied Biology at the University of Bonn and graduated in 1995 with a doctorate on the identi cation of genetic variability in CNS-expressed receptor/transporter genes and their infl uence on neuropsychiatric disorders.

In view of the increasing social and nancial burden generated by these diseases, especially in the setting of an ageing population, the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) has de ned the neurosciences as one of its focal areas. The Focal Area Neurobiology of the DBM complements parallel efforts at the Biozentrum and at the Friedrich Miescher Institute (FMI) and is part of the Neuroscience Network Basel (NNB), which was (has been) acknowledged as a center of competence by the University of Basel in fall 2008. The NNB follows a translational strategy and comprises more than 400 neuroscientists from 40 different laboratories associated with the University, the University Hospitals, the FMI and the Basel Life Science Industry. Research is conducted at all levels - from molecules to behavior - thus pro- viding outstanding research opportunities and an excellent platform for a strong educational program. Furthermore, the NNB offers weekly research seminars and lecture series at the graduate and postgraduate levels, cover- ing all aspects of basic and clinical neuroscience. Finally, the NNB is part of the trinational educational and collaborative NEUREX network along with the neuroscience programs at the Universities of Freiburg (Germany) and Strasbourg (France). A major aim of the Neuroscience groups at the DBM is to take advantage of the unique expertise in the neurosciences present in the Basel area to pur- sue translational research projects. As a consequence of these efforts, basic and clinical neuroscientists have successfully raised grant support for trans- lational research projects from the Swiss National Science Foundation, the European Union, the Swiss Cancer League, the Swiss MS Society and vari- ous private foundations. The focus of these projects is on neuroinfl ammatory, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, neurological and neuromuscular disorders. Several members of the DBM/NNB are actively involved in the new National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) \"The Synaptic Bases of Mental Diseases\". To promote the rapid translation of research results into clinical practice the DBM Focal Area Neurobiology co-organizes the Annual Basel Neurosci- ence Symposium \"From Bench to Bedside\". The one-day event provides a platform for exchange of ideas and is regularly attended by more than 150 local neuroscientists, including basic and clinical researchers from Novartis, Roche, Actelion, Santhera Pharmaceuticals, the FMI and the University of Basel.

White matter injury is a hallmark of HI and CP, and defects in myelination are also commonly identi ed in other neurodevel-opmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD). White mat-ter myelination generally refl ects the progression of functional brain matura-tion and connectivity in the rst years of life, and dysfunction in this crucial process might contribute to the etiology of common symptoms found in CP and ASD. Currently no available therapy targets the long-term consequences of early brain injury, making regenerative medicine a promising area for treat-ment exploration. Several reports suggest that transplanted neural progenitor cells (NPC) promote CNS tissue repair not merely through cell replacement, but by providing trophic and immunomodulatory support for endogenous repair mechanisms. We have promising preliminary data showing that endo-vascular injection of human embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived NPC improve both sensory-motor and cognitive functions in a rodent model of neonatal HI. We observed that NPC treatment speci cally stimulates white matter repair mechanisms such as oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and maturation with signi cant increase in myelin basic protein (MBP) expression. Our results also point to a direct interaction between NPC and microglia through NPC-se-creted factors in vitro and in vivo, in the healthy animals, as recently published (Mosher et al., Nature Neurosciences 2012). The objective of our newly formed DBM research team, is to implement those previous studies initiated at Stanford University, and further investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying human NPC-mediated repair in the context of rodent neonatal HI. As immune cells are known to be home to the CNS at the same time brain development initiates, we are particularly interested in the intermediate role microglia plays in NPC-induced white mat-ter regeneration. Taking the example of another neurodevelopmental disor-der, Rett's Syndrome, we are also aiming to speci cally decipher the role mi-croglia might play in the ontogeny of this devastating disorder, using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based disease modeling approaches. Our group also teamed up with the CNS Discovery Department of Hoffmann-La Roche to evaluate potential cerebrospinal fl uid biomarkers with a predictive value for neurodevelopmental impairments. Besides embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell culture know-how, our methodologies include powerful imaging techniques such as diffusion ten-sor imaging (DTI), bioluminescence imaging and synchrotron X-ray well as behavioral assays, histology and transcriptomics/proteomics. Our laboratory is involved in several collaborations with clinical and research groups in Basel including the Neonatology and Pediatric Neurology Units at UKBB, and F . Hoffmann-La Roche. Active international collaborations also ex-ist with Stanford University, UC San Diego, Duke University Center for in vivo microscopy and the University of Saskatchewan, Canada. Connection to Clinical Practice CSF biomarker assays in developmental brain disorders Our group has ongoing clinical translational research projects to identify biomarkers related to endogenous neurogenesis and regenerative processes in the developing brain. We here concentrate on cerebrospinal fl uid proteomics using differ-ent detection modalities. Selected Publications - Chicha L, Smith T, Guzman R.

Moreover, there is increasing evidence that mechanisms of regeneration are distinct from those of development. A central and challenging issue is to identify the extrinsic and intrinsic factors, which control the balance of self-renewal, proliferation, and cell fate decisions in a context-dependent manner. With our projects, we expect to obtain considerable insights into the expression and function of candidate genes controlling proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells during cortical development and following brain injuries. Cortical development In the developing dorsal telencephalon, neural stem and progenitor cells generate a large variety of neurons with speci c functions in the mature cor-tex. The proto-oncogene Ski is a transcriptional regulator linked to the human 1p36 deletion syndrome, which involves a set of phenotypes including brain abnormalities (Bonnon and Atanasoski 2012). Ski shows a dynamic expres-sion pattern during cortical development, and accordingly, the phenotype of Ski-de cient cortices is complex, involving altered cell cycle characteristics of neural progenitors, disturbed timing of neurogenesis, and misspeci ca-tion of projection neurons (Baranek et al. 2012). In particular, Ski-de cient callosal neurons lose their identity and ectopically express the transcription factor Ctip2. The misspeci ed callosal neurons largely fail to form the corpus callosum and instead redirect their axons towards subcortical targets (Fig. 1). We identify the chromatin-remodeling factor Satb2 as a novel partner of Ski, and show that both proteins are required for transcriptional repression of Ctip2 in callosal neurons. We propose a model in which Satb2 recruits Ski to the Ctip2 locus, and Ski attracts histone deacetylases, thereby enabling the formation of a functional NURD repressor complex (Baranek and Atanasoski 2012). Our ndings establish a central role for Ski-Satb2 interactions in regu-lating transcriptional mechanisms of callosal neuron speci cation.Along this line, we tested the role of mTOR signaling during cortical devel-opment (Cloetta et al. 2013). We inactivated mTORC1 in mice by deleting the gene encoding raptor in the progenitors of the developing CNS. Brains de cient for raptor show a marked microcephaly. We nd that changes in cell cycle length and increased cell death both contribute to the reduction in cell number. Moreover, differentiation of neural progenitors into glia but not into neurons was inhibited. The differentiation defect was paralleled by decreased Stat3 signaling, which is a target of mTORC1 and has been impli-cated in gliogenesis. Our results show that speci c aspects of brain develop-ment critically depend on mTORC1 function. Cortical injuries Little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving proliferation of glial cells after an insult to the CNS. To test the hypothesis that the G1 regulator cyclin D1 is critical for injury-induced cell division of glial cells, we applied an injury model that causes brain damage within a well-de ned region. For this, we injected the neurotoxin ibotenic acid (IBO) into the prefrontal cortex of adult mice, which leads to a local nerve cell loss but does not affect the sur-vival of glial cells. We show that cyclin D1 immunoreativity D1-immunopositive (cyclin D1 +) cell population within the lesioned area consists to a large extent of Olig2 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. Analysis of cyclin D1-de cient mice demonstrates that the proliferation rate of Olig2 + cells diminishes upon Selected Publications - Bonnon C, Atanasoski S. 2012. c-Ski in health and disease.

Further, show that cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 4, but not cdk6 or cdk2, is essential for driving cell division of Olig2-expressing cells in our injury model. These data suggest that distinct cell cycle proteins regulate proliferation of Olig2 + progenitor cells following a CNS insult within the medial temporal lobe of the cerebral cortex is essential for our conscious memory for facts and events. Remark-ably, the hippocampus is one of the very few regions in the CNS of adult mammals, including humans, where new neurons are continuously gener-ated throughout life. This indicates that the new neurons are involved in learning and formation of new memories. In support of this hypothesis, we previously found that newly generated young neurons show enhanced ex-citability and synaptic plasticity as compared to the neighboring mature cells (Schmidt-Hieber et al. 2004, Nature 429:184-187).Within the hippocampus neurogenesis is restricted to granule cells in the den-tate gyrus (Figure 1). They receive excitatory inputs from the entorhinal cortex and project to the CA3 pyramidal cells. The dentate gyrus has some distinct structural features and is believed to serve distinct functions during memory processing. First of all, the granule cells form a so called competitive network as there is strong mutual inhibition via inhibitory GABAergic interneurons. By contrast, the autoassociative network via mutu-ally excitatory synaptic connections (Figure 1). Second, the number of granule cells appears to be ~5-times larger than the number of afferent entorhinal layer II principal cells and ~3-times larger than the number of CA3 pyramidal cells in the output region. This form of expansion recoding within a competitive net-work will generate a sparse and orthogonal (non-overlapping) representation, which will help to separate similar neuronal activity patterns - a function called 'pattern separation'. As a consequence, each memory item can be stored with-in the hippocampal network in a unique fashion. Finally, new granule cells can be generated throughout life from adult neural stem cells located in the sub-granular zone of the dentate gyrus (Figure 2). Proliferation and differentiation of adult neural stem cells is tightly regulated in an activity dependent manner, indicating that the number of neurons might be adjusted to maintain sparse coding even with increasing memory load. During the last three years we have focused on the process of synapse for-mation and synaptic integration of developing newly generated granule cells into the hippocampal circuitry. As extrasynaptic NMDA receptors are believed to support the generation of new spines, we have studied the func-tional properties of extrasynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors in newly generated granule cells during and after synaptic integration (Schmidt-Salzmann et al. 2014). Using fast application of glutamate to outside-out membrane patches, we showed that all immature granule cells express al-ready functional AMPA and NMDA receptors. The density of AMPA recep-tors was small in cells starting to receive excitatory synaptic input ( ~30 pS/ \u00b5m2) nally reach ~120 pS/ \u00b5m2 in fully mature cells. Interestingly, AMPA receptors showed a biphasic change in desensitisation time constant which was slowest during synaptic integration and substantially faster before and afterwards. This was paralleled by a biphasic change in the non-desensitising current component which was maximal during synaptic integration and about two times smaller in fully mature granule cells. Surprisingly, the NMDA-receptor density in young cells was already similar to mature cells ( ~10 pS/ \u00b5m2) and remained relatively constant throughout maturation. Also, functional properties of ex-trasynaptic NMDA-receptors were similar at different developmental stages. These data indicate that the non-desensitising AMPAR currents in newly gen-erated young granule cells might support the effective activation of extrasyn-aptic NMDA receptors to induce Ca 2+ infl ux and Ca2+-dependent activation of Rho-GTPases important for new spine formation. Together with the previously described low Ca 2+-buffer capacity in young cells (Stocca, Schmidt-Hieber, Bischofberger, 2008 J Physiol 586:3795-3811), the large AMPA-currents might constitute a competitive advantage over mature cells for new synapse formation.Cellular Neuro-physiology Prof. Dr. Josef Bischofberger Department of Biomedicine PhysiologyUniversity of Basel Group Members Michael (PhD Dr. Mirko Vukcevic (postdoctoral fellow) * left during report period Selected Publications - Lepski G, Maciaczyk J, Jannes CE, Maciaczyk D, Bischof- berger J, Nikkhah G (2011) Delayed functional matura-tion of human neuronal progenitor cells in vitro. 47:36-44. - Herpfer I, Hezel H, Reichardt W, Clark K, Geiger J, Gross CM, Heyer A, Neagu V, Bhatia H, Atas HC, Fiebich BL, Bischofberger J, Haas CA, Lieb K, Normann C.

We have two main research lines: 1) genomic investigations (including genetic, transcriptional and protein expression analysis) and 2) studies on B cell involvement in MS pathogenesis. Both approaches provide tools for immunomonitoring of current and newly emerging treatments. Immune regulation by microRNAs in MS MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous noncoding RNAs, which are key regulators of many biological processes, e.g. cell proliferation, differen-tiation, apoptosis, signal transduction and organ development. Our miRNA expression pro ling analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes in relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients revealed distinct miRNA patterns in CD4, CD8 and B cells. MiR-17, involved in autoimmunity, was up-regulated in CD4 cells from MS patients. This correlated with alterations in the expression of po-tential target genes of miR-17, i.e. PTEN and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase regulatory unit 1 (PI3KR1), which were down-regulated upon stimulation of CD4 cells with antiCD3/CD28 in vitro. Functional experiments with a syn-thetic inhibitor of miR-17 supported the link between miRNA expression and the altered target gene expression. The more detailed analysis of B cells re-vealed a distinct set of 49 deregulated miRNAs in MS, including members of the miR-17-92 and the miR-106b-25 clusters. In addition, miR-181a, involved in B-cell development, was down regulated in untreated patients. Natalizum-ab, an approved treatment for RRMS, reverted selectively the expression of deregulated miRNAs both in T and B cells (Sievers et al., 2012) (Figure 1). We have expanded our studies to extracellular miRNAs in serum and CSF . We aim to ne cellular and/or extracellular miRNAs as prognostic indica- tors for disease activity and treatment response. B cells and their targets in MS During recent years it has become clear that B-cells have a major role in the pathogenesis of MS. Depletion of B-cells leads to a remarkable amelioration of the disease whereas selective modulation of the B-cell response with a blocker of the TACI receptor induces worsening of MS. The mechanisms by which B-cells impact MS are incompletely understood. Our research focuses on the identi cation of novel B-cell autoantigens and the characterization of the interaction of autoaggressive B-cells with the CNS. We could show that antibodies against native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) iden-tify a subset autoimmune CNS demyelination (Fig-ure 2) (Pr\u00f6bstel AK, 2011). Using an unbiased proteomic approach we iden-ti ed potential novel autoantigens like neurofascin and contactin-2 that point to a critical role of the node of Ranvier for the demyelination process. Cells transfected with potential autoantigens and co-cultures of B-cells with anti- gen expressing cells or cerebellar slice cultures are currently used to identify patients with an autoaggressive B-cell response. This novel approach will shed light on the role of B-cells in the pathogenesis of MS and also provides means to identify autoantigens in their natural environment. Immunomonitoring of new treatments and biomarker research We aim to get a better understanding of altered immunological pathways in MS pathogenesis and to provide new insights into the mode of action of currently available and newly developed treatments. Genomic alterations e.g. deregulated miRNAs are evaluated as biomarkers for monitoring the ef- cacy of approved and experimental therapies. We are using a broad set of immunological read-outs to monitor the immune status during novel im- munomodulatory treatments (Ricklin ME, 2013). To develop biomarkers for neurodegeneration we established the sensitive detection of CSF neu-ro lament heavy chain (NfH), a degeneration product of CNS neurons (Kuhle J, 2011). Combination of these biomarkers with a standardized clinical and neuroradiologic assessment provides a comprehensive de-scription of the disease in individual patients that can be used to predict future disease course and treatment.

This allows access to a unique popula-tion of MS patients in different stages of the disease. There is also a close collaboration with the Division of Neuroradi-ology and the Medical Image Analysis Centre (MIAC) that enables characterization of patients with cutting edge neu-roimaging techniques. This research is directed by Prof Till Spenger, who has a joint appointment at the Departments of Neurology and Radiology. Our Clinical MS Research Group plays a key role in organizing and conducting a series of in-ternational therapeutic studies in MS, e.g. with and GNbAC1. These trials provide unique pos-sibilities to apply basic research approaches to understand disease mechanisms and therapeutic responses. Development of biomarkers needs prospective, standard-ized, and high-quality clinical and neuroradiological data from large patient cohorts to allow for validation and implementa-tion in clinical practice. The Swiss MS Cohort Study (SMSC), supported by the Swiss MS Society and coordinated by our MS Group was initiated in 2012. It aims at building and main-taining a long-term cohort of Swiss MS patients with follow-up clinical and MRI data as well as sampling of body fl uids.

A CB40/41 Developmental Neurobiology and Regeneration Prof. Dr. Josef Kapfhammer Department of Biomedicine AnatomyUniversity of Basel Group Members Sophorn DevelopmentGlutamate dendritic development and plasticity of the vasculature in central nervous system (CNS) slice cultures The shape of the dendritic tree of a neuron refl ects its synaptic input because most synapses are located on the dendritic surface. Our group is interested in how functional activity does affect the growth and shape of the dendritic tree of cerebellar Purkinje cells, the principal cells of the cerebellar cortex. We take advantage of a special culture system which allows growing a thin cerebellar slice in a culture dish. In such cultured slices the dendritic devel-opment of Purkinje cells proceeds in a way very similar to the in vivo situa-tion and results in Purkinje cells with a typical dendritic tree (Fig. 1) which has grown entirely in the culture dish. At the same time the culture setup allows for simple experimental manipulation of the system. The factors and molecules controlling growth and patterning of neuronal dendrites are not yet well understood. We have previously shown that the activity of metabo-tropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) or protein kinase C gamma (PKC) in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures of postnatal mice mediate the growth and development of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree. When we stimulated metabotropic glutamate receptors (but not other types of glutamate recep-tors) the dendritic development of Purkinje cells was severely inhibited and the resulting dendritic tree was much reduced in size and complexity. This inhibition of dendritic growth via activation of metabotropic glutamate re-ceptors could be part of a negative feedback loop which limits the number of excitatory synaptic connections in Purkinje cells. We have now searched for potential signalling mechanisms limiting Purkinje cell dendritic growth and have concentrated on channels allowing the entry of Ca 2+ ions. Using a combination of pharmacological blockade and genetically modi ed mice we have shown that two variants of voltage gated Ca2+ channels, the P/Q-type and T-type Ca2+ channels, are involved in the inhibition of dendritic growth seen after increased mGluR1 or PKC activity in cerebellar slice cultures. As shown in Fig. 2, pharmacological blockade of both P/Q-type and T-type Ca 2+ channels results in a partial rescue of the Purkinje cell dendritic tree after mGluR1 or PKC stimulation. Our ndings imply that Ca 2+ entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is crucially involved in the inhibitory effects on dendritic growth. In contrast, genetic absence or acute blockade of another type of Ca 2+ channels, the TRPC3 channels, had no effect. At the moment our group is exploring whether further molecules involved in maintaining the Ca 2+ equilibrium in Purkinje cells are also involved in the regulation of dendritic growth. In a second line of research we are using the slice culture model for research on the blood brain barrier and the plasticity of the vasculature in the central nervous system. Transient ischemia causes delayed neurodegeneration in selective brain areas, particularly in the CA1 eld of the hippocampus. This is accompanied by neurovascular impairment. It is unknown whether neuro-degeneration is the cause or the consequence of vascular changes. In an en-torhino-hippocampal organotypic slice culture system with well-preserved blood vessels we have studied the interplay between neurodegeneration and integrity of the neurovasculature. Short-term oxygen and glucose de-privation (OGD) resulted in up-regulation of hypoxic markers and with a de-lay of 24 to 48h in selective nerve cell death in CA1. In parallel, local vessel density decreased exclusively in the CA1 area affected by neuronal death (Fig. 3).

The mechanisms by which death of pyramidal neurons mediate vessel loss are not known. Our ndings lay the groundwork for further study of the biological crosstalk between pyramidal neurons and the vasculature and for the role of AMPARs in ischemia-induced neuronal death.

Their formation requires the coordinated formation of a nerve terminal and of a postsynaptic membrane rich in neu-rotransmitter receptors. At the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), the best known signals secreted from motor neurons and regulating the expression of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) in the synaptic muscle membrane are agrin and neuregulin1 (NRG). However, little is known of the mechanisms involved. We have recently elucidated two relevant mechanisms. Agrin acting through MuSK in the muscle is the major presynaptic organizer of postsynaptic differentiation; it is on its own suf cient to induce differentia-tion of functional synaptic membranes in the absence of motor nerves. Neuregulin acts through its receptors, the RTKs ErbB2, -3 and -4. Unlike be-lieved previously, it does not mediate the neural control of synapse-speci c gene transcription such as the AChR genes. Nevertheless, the density of the AChRs at the synaptic membrane was reduced in mice lacking NRG/ErbB signaling. In principle, synaptic AChR density can be regulated through AChR insertion into or increased removal from the synaptic membrane. Comparison of AChR removal from the synaptic membrane of NMJs in wild type mice and in mice lacking neuromuscular NRG/ErbB signaling showed that in the latter, anchor-ing of AChRs in the postsynaptic muscle membrane was destabilized, result-ing in faster migration of from the synaptic to the perisynaptic mem-brane. Speci cally, in mice in which NRG signaling to muscle was genetically or pharmacologically abolished, postsynaptic AChRs moved rapidly from the synaptic to the perisynaptic membrane, and the subsynaptic scaffold that an-chors the AChRs was impaired. These defects combined compromised synap- tic transmission at NMJs in vivo. Blockade of NRG/ErbB signaling in cultured myotubes abolished phosphorylation selectively of -dystrobrevin1, but not of other components of the subsynaptic apparatus. Thus, NRG/ErbB signal-ing maintains high ef cacy of synaptic transmission by stabilizing the postsyn-aptic apparatus via phosphorylation of -dystrobrevin1. So far, the only mechanism for agrin to regulate synaptic clustering of AChRs was thought to be by organizing a postsynaptic apparatus, a complex of pro-teins at the synapse trapping the AChRs and anchoring them to the actin cytoskeleton of the muscle ber. We now found that agrin regulates AChR clustering also through organizing the focal delivery of AChRs into the synap-tic membrane. This occurs via a network of microtubules focused with their plus ends to the postsynaptic membrane. At NMJs in vivo, this mechanism ac-counts for about 30% of normal AChR density. leads to cap- turing of microtubules to the synaptic membrane, thus enabling AChR focal delivery to the synapse. MT capturing is regulated through local activation of PI3-K. This has two effects: 1) it phosphorylates (and thus inactivates) GSK3b at the synaptic membrane, which renders the plus end protein CLASP2 un-phosphorylated locally at the synapse, thus increasing its af nity to MT plus ends and their ability to interact with the synaptic membrane; CLASP2-de-pendent capturing at the postsynaptic membrane is through interaction with LL5b, a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) binding protein, and 2) LL5b itself is recruited to the synapse through its binding to PIP3. In vivo, genetic deletion of CLASP2 or knock-down and synaptic AChR density by about 30% each. Our experiments thus reveal a novel mechanism for agrin to cluster AChRs at the NMJ, i.e. through the organization of a subsynaptic MT net-work for focal AChR delivery to the synapse.

We are giving emphasis to the control of neuronal excitability by G-pro-tein coupled receptors (GPCRs), in particular GABA receptors, mGlu5 recep- tors, dopamine receptors and Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1). GABA B receptors GABA B receptors the GPCRs inhibitory acid (GABA). Their and behavioral states (Gassmann and Bettler, 2012). GABA B receptors have been implicated in a variety of neurological and psychiatric conditions, in-cluding epilepsy, anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, addiction and pain. Despite the involvement of GABA B receptors in mental health disorders, the clinical use of GABA B receptor agonists is cur- rently limited to the treatment of narcolepsy, neuropathic pain, spasticity and dystonia. One reason for this is that the main therapeutic effect of baclofen - the prototypical GABA B receptor agonist in clinical use - has unwanted side effects for mental health indications. A large body of work suggests that native GABA B receptors vary in their kinetic and pharmacological properties. The origin of this variation is un-clear. To some extent, it may be explained by the existence of associated proteins that alter receptor properties. In collaboration with B. Fakler (Uni-versity Freiburg iBr) we af nity-puri ed native GABA B receptor complexes and identi ed their constituents using tandem mass-spectrometry. We found that GABA B receptors not only comprise principal GABA B1a, GABA B1b and GABA KCTD8, 12, 12b and 16 sub- units (Fig. 1B,C). The KCTDs seem to be the missing components that confer fast activation kinetics, variation in the desensitization kinetics and distinct agonist potencies to native GABA B receptor responses. In the presence of KCTD12, GABA B receptor activation elicits a strongly desensitizing response (Fig. 1C). By contrast, in the presence of KCTD16, the activated receptors induce largely non-desensitizing responses (Fig. 1C). We found that distinct KCTD protein domains promote and inhibit receptor-mediated desensitiza-tion (Seddik et al., 2012). These differential effects, together with the dis-tinct spatial and temporal KCTD distribution patterns (Metz et al., 2011), support the view that KCTDs contribute to the variation in native GABA B receptor responses (Ivankova et al., 2013). The discovery that KCTDs confer subtype-speci city on GABA B receptors presents opportunities for drug dis- covery. Indeed, drugs that target individual receptor subtypes would allow more-speci c therapeutic interference with GABA B receptor signaling. The advantages of such drugs could include a reduction in side effects as well as entirely new therapeutic applications. To support drug discovery we are analyzing the mechanism of action of the KCTD proteins. Moreover, we are using a combination of knock-down and overexpression strategies to ana-lyze whether GABA B receptor-associated proteins other than the KCTDs in- fl uence receptor distribution, neuronal processes and higher brain functions. mGlu5 receptors In collaboration with L. Lindemann (Roche, Basel) we have identi ed novel mGlu5 receptor-associated proteins. We are currently characterizing the newly identi ed proteins for their effects on mGlu5 receptor functions in vi-tro and in vivo. Dopamine receptors In collaboration with B. Fakler (University Freiburg iBr.) and C. L\u00fcscher we have been awarded a Sinergia grant from the Swiss National Science Foundation to identify dopamine receptor-associated proteins. We are analyzing several receptor-associated proteins for their effects on dopa-mine receptor functions in vitro and in vivo. Trace amine receptor 1 In collaboration with M. H\u00f6hner (Roche, Basel) we have found a cross-talk between TAAR1 and dopamine receptors (Revel et al., 2011). We are currently studying the underlying mechanism.Connection to Clinical Practice Constitutive Notch2 signaling in hepatic tumors and neural stem cells Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCC) are the most common liver tumors and a leading cause for cancer-related death in men. Notch2 regulates cellular dif-ferentiation in the liver. Notch signaling is implicated in vari-ous cancers, but it is unclear whether Notch2 contributes to HCC and CCC formation. We generated mice that ectopical-ly express activated Notch2 in the liver. In collaboration with M. Heim we found that liver-speci c expression of Notch2 is suf cient to induce HCC formation and biliary hyperpla-sia. Using the diethylnitrosamine (DEN) HCC carcinogenesis model, we further showed that Notch2 signaling accelerates DEN-induced HCC formation (Dill et al., 2013). DEN-induced HCCs with constitutive Notch2 signaling exhibit a marked in-crease in size, and proliferation when compared with HCCs from DEN-induced control mice. Additionally, DEN treated mice constitutively expressing Notch2 eventually develop CCC. Our data establish an oncogenic role for constitutive Notch2 signaling in liver cancer development. In collabora-tion with A. Merlo (Neurosurgery) and B. Hemmings (FMI Basel) we found that constitutive Notch2 signaling in neural stem cells promotes tumorigenic features and astroglial lin-eage entry in mice (Tchorz et al., 2012).Prof. Dr. Heim, Prof. Dr. Adrian Merlo Gastroenterology and Neurosurgery (2013) Upregulation of GABA B receptor signaling by constitutive assembly KCTD12. 24848-56.

A | The principal subunits of GA- BA B receptors - GABAB1a, GABAB1b and GABAB2 - have the prototypical seven transmembrane domains of G protein-coupled receptors and form two distinct core units: GABAB(1b,2). GABAB1a and GABAB1b are differ by presence of two amino-terminal sushi domains in GABAB1a. Where- as these subunits contain the GABA binding site, GABAB2 subunits couple to the G protein. B | The principal subunits associate with and feature a conserved tetramerization T1 domain as well as one or two car-boxy-terminal 'homology' domains (H1 and H2). The T1 domains form homotetra-mers that bind to GABA B2. The phylogenetic tree depicts the evolutionary relation- ships among the KCTDs. The branch length represents the percentage of amino acid substitutions between proteins. C | Biochemical experiments demonstrated the association of principal with auxiliary GABA B receptor subunits. The panel shows solubilized native GABA B receptor complexes from rat brain that were size-frac- tionated on non-denaturing blue native PAGE and SDS-PAGE. Receptor subunits were detected with speci c antibodies. KCTD16 was associated with high molec-ular weight receptor complexes, whereas KCTD12 was associated with low mo-lecular weight complexes (molecular weights are indicated in kDa). These nd-ings demonstrate the existence of GABA B receptor subtypes that contain particu- lar KCTD subunits. Medium molecular weight complexes possibly incorporate a mix of KCTD12 and KCTD16. The presence of KCTDs accelerates the rise-time of the GABA B response, which is shown here by baclofen-induced G protein-activat- ed inwardly rectifying potassium channel (GIRK) currents in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. The presence of KCTD12 or KCTD12b (not shown) confers a marked desensitization on the GABA B response. It is unknown whether simultane- ous incorporation of KCTD12 and KCTD16 into the same receptor complex pro-duces receptor responses with intermediate desensitization kinetics (Gassmann & Bettler, Reviews Neuroscience, 2012). 46/47 Neurobiology Prof. Dr. Nicole Schaeren-Wiemers Department of Biomedicine University Hospital Basel Group Members Sarah Brunner* (Master student) Lukas Enz (Medical and Traf cking Multiple SclerosisPeripheral NeuropathyNeuroprotectionMolecular mechanisms of myelin formation and maintenance in health and disease Generation of functional myelinated nerves requires a reciprocal communi- cation between the myelinating cells and their associated axons. Myelination is established by highly specialized glial cells, oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system (CNS) and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, that wrap axons with a multilayered myelin membrane for rapid impulse con-duction. In addition, axonal signals regulate the survival, migration and dif-ferentiation of Schwann cells as well as the myelination process. We are us-ing basic as well as clinical approaches for investigating the complex nature of the myelin membrane during myelination and in demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and primary demyelinating peripheral neuropathies. Our current projects in the lab involve the characterization of the functional role of the myelin proteins MAL, PMP22 and MAG in axon-glia interaction in health and disease, and the endogenous neuroprotective mechanisms in MS. The knowledge of the selective function of the different components of the complex myelin structure is a prerequisite to understand the different mechanisms, which may damage myelin in MS and in primary demyelinating neuropathies leading to axonal degeneration. The myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL is a component of lipid rafts, and is important for targeting proteins and lipids to distinct myelin domains. MAL overexpression impedes peripheral myelinogenesis evident by a de-layed onset of myelination and reduced expression of the myelin protein zero (MPZ/P0) and low af nity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (Buser et al., 2009). We investigated the molecular mechanisms of MAL-overexpression on Schwann cell differentiation in more detail in primary mouse Schwann cell cultures that resemble the in vivo observation to a large extend. Since the reduced expression of MPZ and p75NTR was already determined be- fore Schwann cell differentiation, the effect of MAL might be implicated dur- ing early developmental stages. Their transcription was robustly reduced, despite the fact that most transcription factors and receptors important for Schwann cell differentiation were not affected by MAL overexpression. In addition, the induction of the CREB and PI3-kinase signaling pathways was functional, highlighting that other rate limiting factors do exist. We identi ed a number of genes implicated in the cytoskeleton organization and plasma Fig. 1: Schematic illustration of putative functional roles of the identi ed ferentially in myelin protein zero (MPZ) as well as phosphory-lation of Akt were unaffected by MAL overexpression. Microarray analysis revealed that a number of differentially expressed transcripts in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells were associated with the cytoskeleton organization and plasma membrane mo-bility (copied from Schmid et al., 2013). Inset shows immunfl uorescent micrograph of cultured Schwann cells. membrane dynamic (Figure 1) that are regulated in a MAL-dependent manner, underlining their possible role in infl uencing dif-ferentiation (CMT1A) is a hereditary demy- elinating peripheral neuropathy caused by the duplication of the PMP22 gene. Demyelination precedes the occurrence of clinical symptoms that correlate with axonal degeneration. Apparent Schwann cell pathology led to the hypothesis that a disturbed axon-glia interface might contribute to al-tered myelination consequently leading to axonal degeneration. In a recent study, we examined the expression of MAG and Necl4, two critical adhesion molecules that are present at the axon-myelin interface, in sural nerve bi-opsies of CMT1A patients and in peripheral nerves of mice overexpressing human PMP22, an animal model for CMT1A. We show an increase in the expression of MAG and a strong decrease of Necl4 in biopsies of CMT1A patients as well as in CMT1A mice. Expression analysis revealed that MAG is strongly upregulated during peripheral nerve maturation, whereas Necl4 expression remains very low throughout development and in the adult. Ab-lating MAG in CMT1A mice results in separation of axons from their myelin sheath (Figure 2) demonstrating that MAG is important for axon-glia contact in CMT1A disease, and suggest that its increased expression has a compen-satory role in the pathology of the disease. Thus, we demonstrate that MAG together with other adhesion molecules such as Necl4 is important in sus-taining axonal integrity. Further, we identi ed that lack of Necl4 in CMT1A might contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease (Kinter et al., 2012). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic infl ammatory demyelinating CNS disease, predominantly affecting young adults and leading to substan-tial disability in a high proportion of patients. The pathology underlying this disease is the formation of multiple demyelinated lesions. Lesions are typically widely disseminated in the CNS with the prevalence of well myelinated areas. In recent years, damage to neurons and axons, as well as grey matter abnormalities gained increasing attention in MS research. Extended grey matter lesions detected throughout the cerebral cortex have been linked to clinical manifestations such as seizures, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. By investigating otherwise pathologically normal appearing grey matter (NAGM) tissue from MS patients, we identi ed reduced transcriptional expression of genes predominantly expressed by astrocytes contributing to the functionality of astrocyte-neuron meta-bolic exchanges important for the maintenance of brain energy metab-olism. Further, an increased expression of transcripts indicative of IL1 signaling pathway activation was detected in MS NAGM. Treatment of primary mouse cortical astrocyte cultures with IL1 or activation of in- fl ammasomes by LPS plus ATP treatment elicited comparable changes as detected in MS NAGM. Reduced transcriptional regulation of MCT1 and CX43 was also observed in an animal model for peripheral immune re-sponse. Our data demonstrate that infl ammation-mediated changes can directly infl uence the metabolic pro of astrocytes and by that, greatly infl uence CNS integrity. Our results highlight a possible detrimental role of chronic infl ammation on the functional integrity of cortical grey matter and suggest that these alterations are a major pathogenic component in MS NAGM. Persistent reduction of astroglial metabolic components, es-sential for sustaining neuronal homeostasis and synapse activity, might actively contribute to the underlying molecular mechanisms of fatigue and cognitive dysfunctions encountered in MS patients (Zeis et al., manu-script submitted).Selected Publications - Schmid D., Zeis T., Sobrio M., and Schaeren-Wiemers N.

Finding therapies is imperative as these disabling neuromuscular diseases have a high personal and socioeconomic impact. Our laboratory focuses on developing treatment strategies for muscular dystrophies due to dysferlin de ciency, myotonic dystrophy and facio-scapulo-humeral muscular dys-trophy (FSHD). Additionally, our laboratory is interested in basic research questions regarding regulation of muscle homeostasis in health and disease. Dysferlin is a transmembrane protein implicated in surface membrane repair of muscle cells. Mutations in dysferlin lead to progressive muscle membrane damage and cause the muscular dystrophies Miyoshi Myopa-thy, Limb Com-partment Myopathy. Our laboratory has studied the dysferlin protein and the DYSF gene in great detail: we have identi ed dysferlin protein binding partners (Di Fulvio et al. 2011, Azakir et al. 2010), characterized lipid bind-ing speci cities of individual dysferlin domains (Therrien et al. 2009), elu-cidated the degradation pathway of mis-sense mutated dysferlin (Azakir et al. 2012a), identi ed the dysferlin domain requirement for membrane re-pair and generated functional mini-dysferlin proteins (Azakir et al. 2012b), inferred the impact of dysferlin gene mutations on protein structure (Ther-rien et al. 2006), and were the rst to report a mild dysferlinopathy pheno-type associated with an in-frame exon skipping mutation of the dysferlin gene (Sinnreich et al. 2006). Based on the insights gained, we are currently designing therapeutic strategies for dysferlinopathies. We are investigating gene delivery of small recombinantly generated dys-ferlin molecules via adeno-associated virus (AAV) to mouse skeletal muscle. Dysferlin's large size precludes its encapsulation into AAV, the vector of choice for gene therapy to skeletal muscle. Therefore, we generated inter-nally truncated dysferlin constructs, each lacking one of the seven dysfer-lin C2 domains, which mediate lipid and protein binding interactions. We demonstrated that certain C2 domains are dispensable for dysferlin's correct plasmalemmal localization and membrane repair function in patient derived muscle cells (Azakir et al., 2012b). Based on these results, we designed func-tional mini-dysferlin molecules, which are small enough to be incorporated into AAV, and which are capable of repairing membranes of patient derived myoblasts. We are currently testing these constructs in experiments with AAV mediated gene transfer to skeletal muscle of dysferlin de cient mice. Myotonic Dystrophy type I (DM1) is a disabling, genetic disease affecting multiple organ systems. This disease is caused by expanded CTG triplet re-peats in the 3'UTR of the Kinase (DMPK) gene. Disease severity is correlated to the repeat expansion size. On the RNA level such expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) form hairpin structures, which lead to ribonuclear inclusions. More speci cally, RNA sequesters the splice-factor muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1), which is necessary to regulate alternative splicing. Lack of available MBNL1 leads to mis-regulate alternative splicing of many different genes explaining the mul-tisystem phenotype. We have screened libraries of small molecular weight compounds that are capable of liberating sequestered splice factors from toxic RNA hairpins. We are currently testing these compounds in mouse models of the disease.In collaboration with the group of Professor Markus R\u00fcegg at the Biozentrum (University of Basel), we study autophagy pathways in skeletal muscle. Au-tophagy is a catabolic process that ensures homeostatic cell clearance and is deregulated in a growing number of myopathological conditions. Proteasomal inhibition for dysferlinopathies Dysferlinopathies are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, and many patients with this disease harbour mis-sense mutations in at least one of their two pathogenic DYSF alleles. These patients have signi cantly reduced or absent dysferlin levels in skeletal muscle, suggesting that the pro-tein encoded by dysferlin mis-sense alleles is rapidly degrad-ed by the cell's quality control system. In a recent study per-formed on patient derived myoblasts (Azakir et al. 2012a), we showed that endogenous mis-sense mutated dysferlin is degraded by the proteasomal system. Inhibition of the pro-teasome substantially increased the level of mis-sense mu-tated dysferlin and the salvaged protein was functional as it restored membrane resealing and myotube formation in pa-tient-derived muscle cells. We are currently conducting a proof-of-principle clinical study of Bortezomib (Velcade TM) in dysferlinopathy patients with mis-sense mutations, in which we monitor dysferlin expression in skeletal muscle after Bort-ezomib administration.Connection to Clinical Practice Selected Publications - Castets P ., Lin S., Rion N., Di Fulvio S., Romanino K., Guri- di M., Frank S., Tintignac L.A., Sinnreich M., R\u00fcegg M.A. Sustained activation of mTORC1 in skeletal muscle in-hibits constitutive and starvation-induced autophagy and 7;17(5):731-44. doi: Apr 18. - Azakir S., Salomon S., Brockhoff M., C., Sinnreich M.

In particular, we study the pharmacology of amphetamine psychostimulants both in vitro and in humans. Amphetamine-type drugs in-clude medications such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) used to treat attention-de cit hyperactivity disorder but also recreational drugs including metham-phetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) and many novel designer drugs known as cathinones (\"research chemicals\", \"legal highs\"). An important line of our research characterizes the pharmacological mecha-nism of action of the many novel designer drugs that continue to emerge in-cluding phenethylamines, cathinones, and piperazillines. We characterized the pharmacology of several of these new drugs of abuse (Fig. 1). Speci cal-ly, we determined norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin uptake inhibi-tion in vitro using human cells that express the respective monoamine trans-porter, drug-induced effl nities to monoamine transporters and receptors. For example, we showed that mephedrone releases dopamine and serotonin similar to MDMA but it was a more potent dopamine uptake inhibitor. In contrast, 3,4-methlylene-dioxypyrovalerone (MDPV) shows structural similarities to MDMA, but its pharmacology is very different. MDPV is an extremely potent uptake inhibi-tor of dopamine and norepinephrine but it does not release monoamines, more similar to cocaine but with a much higher potency and an expected higher abuse potential due to is predominant dopaminergic effects. Pharmacology of amphetamine-type stimulants: mechanism of action of MDMA in vitro and in humans In a larger series of translational and experimental clinical studies we char- acterized the mechanism of action of MDMA. We showed that MDMA mainly releases the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in vitro and that both monoamines are also important mediators of the psychoactive and adverse effects in humans (Fig. 2). Ecstasy use can result in cardiovas-cular and hyperthermic complications, which are rare but potentially lethal. Ecstasy-induced hyperthermia may be triggered by additional factors such high ambient temperature, physical activity, and dehydration. However, we showed that MDMA increased body temperature even in the absence of such predisposing factors and that the thermogenic response to MDMA in humans is mediated through 1- and \u00df-adrenergic receptors. Based on these experimental data in humans, -\u00df-blockers such as carvedilol could be useful in the treatment of ecstasy-induced hyperthermia. More recently, we have also started to explore drug effects on social cognition. Ecstasy is reported by recreational drug users to enhance empathy and sociability. We therefore explored whether MDMA indeed alters social cognition or behav-ior in humans in a controlled experimental setting in addition to its direct subjective emotional effects. Indeed, in a test of recognition of basic facial emotions, MDMA impaired recognition of negative facial emotions such as sad or fear. Consistently, MDMA also impaired the correct identi cation of subtle negative affective states in the reading the mind in the eyes test. In contrast, MDMA enhanced mind reading for positive emotions (Fig. 3). Fur-ther, MDMA enhanced emotional empathy and prosociality in the laboratory setting. This means that MDMA interacts with the processing of emotions and aspects of social cognition that are of importance for human interaction behavior and likely contribute to the appeal of this drug to young people. Finally, we are similarly investigating the social-emotional effects of methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) in healthy subjects because methylphenidate is used as Selected Publications - Simmler, L., Buser, T., Donzelli, M., Hoener, M.

The last decade has seen substantial progress in identifying and isolating stem cells from different adult tissues and embryonic origin, which can be induced to differentiate into various speci c cell-types relevant to regenerative medicine. The groups of this focal area are active in various aspects of this fascinating eld with relevance to basic, mechanistic and clini- cally applied, translational research. The basic research efforts aim to identify and isolate stem cells and under- stand how stem cells are maintained in their normal niches within the embryo and/or the body. As such, several groups are studying how stem cells of the blood are maintained in the bone marrow, differentiate into the various different cell-types of the hematopoietic system, and how their differentia- tion potential is altered in malignant states that are caused by aberrant stem cell-based cancers (e.g. leukemia or lymphomas). The close interactions of clinical with basic researchers allow bridging the gap between fundamental and translational research. For example, attempts to grow and differenti- ate mesenchymal stem cells from human and mouse bone marrow in vitro into different cell- and tissue-types, aim at developing cartilage and bone replacement therapies that can be translated to the clinic. The knowledge gained from these studies forms the basis for designing and developing clini- cally applicable tissue engineering strategies and in moving toward regen-erative medicine. One of the major aims of regenerative medicine is to reactivate and support the regenerative potential of the body in a controlled manner. To this aim, un- derstanding the normal regulation of organogenesis and tissue homeostasis is crucial. While rst attempts have given encouraging results, it is important to gain a much better knowledge of how stem cells interact with their niche to maintain their multi-potency and give rise to daughter cells that undergo transient ampli cation upon leaving the niche. These populations of tran- sient amplifying cells will then initiate their speci cation and differentiation in a controlled manner. Our challenge is to establish culture conditions where stem cells can be maintained and their speci cation and differentiation into functional tissues can be induced in an ef cient and precisely controlled manner. Any functional organ and tissue will consist of well-organized and functionally interacting cells with different identities. Therefore, it is impor- tant to e.g. understand the role of embryonic signaling centers in tissue pat-terning/organization and cell-type speci cation/differentiation. Prof. Dr. R. Zeller Department of Biomedicine AnatomyUniversity of Basel Prof. Dr. J. Passweg Division of HematologyUniversity Hospital BaselFocal Area CoordinatorsThe knowledge gained from analyzing cell-type, tissue speci cation and organogenesis during normal embryonic development is highly relevant to directed engineering of tissues from progenitor and/or stem cells. So- called induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells - adult cells (e.g. skin cells) re- programmed into stem-like cells - are increasingly used as they can be rela- tively easily obtained from patients for cell differentiation and tissue engi- neering studies. The generation and analysis of iPS cells ts the strategy of the DBM to promote collaborative efforts between basic research groups and clinicians with the aim to signi cantly reduce the gap between bench and bedside. In addition to interactions within the DBM, there are numerous collaborations with groups at the Biozentrum, FMI and the D-BSSE, which are funded by network grants such as Sinergia and SystemsX.ch. Many of our groups are actively participating in the Basel Stem Cell Network, which is one of the Competence Centers within the Life Sciences at the Univer- sity of Basel. There, stem cell researchers have the opportunity to closely interact and collaborate with developmental biologists, geneticists and even mathematicians with the objective to foster interdisciplinary and innovative research. Last but not least, with Verdon Taylor and Claudia Lengerke, we recently ap- pointed two stem cell experts in the elds of brain development and hema- topoietic stem cell signaling. Their groups help strengthening both basic and translational research efforts in this rapidly emerging and highly competitive research eld. 54/55 Cardiobiology Prof. Dr. Marijke Brink Department of Biomedicine Physiology and Division of CardiologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Fabienne Battilana (Master report periodHeart Failure HypertensionObesityCardiac MetabolismSignal TransductionMyocyte growth and metabolism in cardiac disease The heart continuously needs to generate high amounts of ATP to perform its critical function as pump that circulates blood throughout the body. In the healthy heart, almost all ATP is derived from mitochondrial oxidative phos-phorylation and the heart therefore relies on a continuous oxygen supply. When cardiac work has to increase, for example in pathological conditions such as hypertension, hypertrophy develops and metabolism is adapted to ensure that energy supplies meet the demands. Cardiovascular disease is of-ten accompanied by cardiac cell loss via apoptosis or necrosis because meta-bolic substrates and oxygen supplies are inadequate. Reduced numbers of contractile cells along with insuf cient performance of the remaining cardio-myocytes contribute to the progression to heart failure. Approaches taken to reduce cardiac disease may therefore aim to improve the performance of the differentiated cardiomyocytes, to prevent their death, or to generate new cardiomyocytes from precursor cells. The goal of our research is to provide a fundamental basis for such approaches by advancing the understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate growth and metabolism in cardiac cells. We are analyzing these mechanisms in primary cell cultures as well as in vivo models of obesity and cardiac pressure overload, as the latter mimic clinical conditions that represent a major health problem. Our ongoing investigations are based on our earlier ndings in an animal model of high blood pressure, which demonstrated that IGF-I modulates cardiac and skeletal muscle weight by regulating speci c protein synthesis and degradation pathways. One of the key intracellular mediators of IGF-I-induced growth is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR inte-grates hormonal signals such as that of insulin and IGF with information on nutrient and energy availability as well as cellular stress. mTOR activates dis- tinct substrates with tissue-speci c functions depending on whether it is part of the multiprotein complex mTORC1 or mTORC2. In our studies, we are analyzing to what extent cardiac stress factors such as pressure overload, ischemia, nutrient deprivation, or a high fat diet change the activity of mTORC1 and mTORC2 and thereby modulate cardiac composition, geom-etry and function. Next to investigating how mTORC1 and mTORC2 play a role in cardiac protein synthesis, proteasomal degradation, autophagy (Fig. 1) and energy metabolism, we analyze stress-related changes in select-ed cardiac-speci c proteins. For these studies, we generated mouse models in which raptor or rictor, speci c and essential components of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively, were ablated in a cardiomyocyte-speci c manner. The deletions are induced during adulthood and followed by the experimental protocols mentioned above; functional and structural consequences are evaluated by ultrasound and immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 2). In control mice, pressure over-load causes an increase in cardiac weight suf cient to maintain normal car-diac ejection fractions. Raptor knockout mice in which cardiac mTORC1 is inactivated are not able to produce this adaptive hypertrophic growth and rapidly develop cardiac dysfunction. Even with a normal cardiac workload, sedentary raptor knockout mice develop cardiac dysfunction that culminates in death within 6 weeks (Shende, 2011). In contrast, rictor ablation, despite successfully reducing the phosphorylation of a range of mTORC2 targets, affects cardiac geometry or function under baseline conditions neither in young growing nor in adult mice during aging, up to 54 weeks. Pressure overload, however, causes eccentric hypertrophy and decreases ventricular function in rictor-de cient mice (Shende, 2013). While mTORC1 inactiva- tion causes severe dysfunction mainly by reducing protein synthesis and mitochondrial content and by increasing apoptosis, mTORC2 inactivation leads to dysfunction via its effects on PKC signaling. Our ongoing studies are relating these effects to the activation of adrenergic and ErbB2 recep-tors (Pentassuglia, 2013).

PLoS One. 2012;7:e38331Cardiovascular disease in Europe Cardiovascular disease causes over 4 million deaths in Europe each year, which represents 47% of all deaths in Europe (52% of deaths in women, 42% of deaths in men). Overall cardio-vascular disease is estimated to cost the EU economy almost \u20ac196 billion a year. Levels of obesity are high in both adults and children, and the prevalence of diabetes has increased rapidly over the last ten years, increasing by more than 50% in many countries (European Cardiovascular Disease Sta-tistics 2012 edition). Obesity is associated with some of the major risk factors for cardiovascular diseases such as hyper-tension. This is especially true for the elderly female popu-lation: there is a higher prevalence of obesity, diabetes and hypertension in older women associated with an increased prevalence of stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy and dia-stolic heart failure. Estrogen de ciency has been proposed as one of the reasons for this increase. Given the aforemen-tioned epidemiological data, our basic research aims to ac-quire a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that un-derlie hypertension- and obesity-induced cardiac disease in male as well as in ovariectomized female mice without or with hormone replacement.Connection to Clinical Practice Fig. 1: Analysis of the regulation of autophagy is performed in isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes after trans-fection with pEGFP-LC3 to visualize the autophagosomes (green).

Most important in that respect are complications of atherosclerosis (myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral artery disease), but other disease entities such as myocarditis contribute to a considerable dis-ease burden particularly in young individuals. Noninvasive imaging plays an increasing role in diagnosis, risk strati cation and assessment of treatment responses in cardiology. Advances in image technology over the last years has allowed for depiction of the heart and blood vessels with ever increasing detail. Novel imaging technologies termed molecular imaging use detection of site-targeted contrast agents to depict the molecular footprint of a disease-relevant phenotype at the cellular level. It is thought that such techniques will in the future contribute to earlier detection of disease, to better risk strati- cation and to better assessment of treatment-responses. Molecular imag-ing with ultrasound contrast agents relies on the detection of microbubbles within diseased tissue. Microbubbles produce an acoustic signal owing to their resonant properties in an ultrasound eld. Microbubble targeting is ac-complished by either manipulating the microbubble shell for attachment of microbubbles to activated leukocytes, or by conjugation of disease speci c ligands to the microbubble surface (Fig. 1). Ultrasound molecular imaging of treatment responses in atherosclerosis Up-regulation and surface expression of vascular endothelial cell adhesion molecules are early events in atherogenesis. P-selectin on the endothelial cell surface mediates rolling and activation of leukocytes. Firm adhesion is then mediated by Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) on the en- dothelial surface. Together, these molecules play a critical role in leukocyte arrest in blood vessels, and participate in the early stages of atherogenesis. We have previously shown that non-invasive imaging of P-Selectin and VCAM-1 can detect vascular infl ammation during the very early stages of atherosclerotic disease. For pharmacologic interventions that are started ear-ly in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, or that include novel drug regimens with the goal of reducing vascular infl ammation, the ability to non-invasively assess treatment effects on vascular infl ammatory status will be important. We could show that ultrasound molecular imaging can detect the effects of statin therapy on early infl ammatory processes in atherosclerosis at a time-point when high-resolution imaging does not show differences in plaque thickness (Fig. 2). While statins are currently the drugs of choice for slow-ing atherosclerotic disease progression, other drugs, among them antioxi-dative compounds, continue to be developed. Apocynin is an antioxidative NADPH-oxidase-inhibitor with anti-infl ammatory properties. We used con- trast enhanced ultrasound molecular imaging to assess whether short-term apocynin therapy in atherosclerosis reduces vascular oxidative stress and endothelial activation. We showed that short-term treatment with apocynin in atherosclerosis reduces endothelial cell expression. This change in endothelial infl ammatory phenotype could be detected by molecular imaging before any measurable decrease in macrophage content, and was not associated with a detectable change in oxidative burden. Ultrasound molecular imaging of myocarditis Dilated cardiomyopathy as a consequence of viral myocarditis is a frequent cause for heart failure in young adults with a signi cant disease burden. In young patients presenting to the emergency department with either chest pain or signs of heart failure, myocarditis is a differential diagnosis.

Our research focuses on the basic principles governing vascular growth and their translation into rational therapeutic ap-proaches to: 1) treat ischemic diseases, and 2) improve the vascularization of tissue-engineered grafts. We use precursor cells genetically modi ed to ex-press controlled levels and combinations of factors, in order to provide both vascular growth and tissue regeneration, combining the speci c advantages of cell and gene therapy.Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the master regulator of vascular growth. However, uncontrolled expression leads to the growth of vascular tumors (angiomas). By the close interaction of basic scientists and clinical surgeons, we are developing novel methods to deliver the VEGF gene alone or in combination with maturation factors to increase its safety and ef cacy in vivo, through the use of transduced progenitors, gene therapy vectors and controlled release of recombinant proteins by smart biomaterials. Research is funded by Swiss agencies (SNSF and Swiss Heart Foundation), the Euro-pean Union and industrial funds. 1) Controlled VEGF expression for therapeutic vascularization We previously found that the transition between normal and aberrant angiogenesis depends on the VEGF amount in the microenvironment around each producing cell rather than on the total dose, since VEGF remains tightly localized in the extracellular matrix (Ozawa 2004; Ban 2005). In order to translate this biological concept into a clinically applica-ble approach, we developed a high-throughput FACS-based technology to rapidly purify progenitors expressing speci c VEGF levels after in vitro transduction (Misteli 2010; Wolff 2012). Controlled VEGF expression by FACS-puri ed populations of diverse progenitors could induce effective vascularization and cardiomyocyte differentiation in thick, engineered cardiac patches (Marsano 2013), therapeutic angiogenesis in ischemic myocardium (Melly 2012 and in vivo vascularization of osteogenic grafts (Helmrich 2013). To avoid the safety concerns raised by genetically modi ed progeni- tors, we took advantage of a state-of-the-art biomaterial platform for the controlled release of matrix-bound growth factors, developed by Jeffrey Hubbell (EPFL, Lausanne). We could achieve controlled release over 4 weeks and identify a 500-fold range of VEGF concentrations inducing only physiological capillary networks, which were long-term stable, func-tionally perfused and therapeutically effective in ischemic wound healing (Sacchi, manuscript submitted). 2) Cellular and molecular mechanisms of VEGF dose-dependent angiogenesis Our understanding of angiogenic mechanisms is mostly based on de- velopmental models, in which new vessels sprout to vascularize tissues. However, we found that VEGF delivery to skeletal muscle, at the doses needed for functional bene t, induces vascular growth without sprout-ing, but rather by circumferential enlargement of pre-existing vessels, fol-lowed by longitudinal splitting, or intussusception (Gianni-Barrera 2013; Fig. 1). Further, the molecular basis for the induction of angiogenesis by sprouting or intussusception by VEGF is provided by opposite patterns of activation of Notch1 signaling (Gianni-Barrera 2011 and manuscript sub-mitted). We also found that the transition between normal and aberrant angiogenesis is not an intrinsic property of VEGF dose, but depends on the balance between VEGF-induced endothelial stimulation and vas- cular maturation mediated by pericyte recruitment by PDGF-BB (Ban 2012). Taking advantage of the highly controlled cell-based gene delivery platform we developed, we are currently pursuing a systematic inves-tigation of the mechanisms that regulate the switch between normal and aberrant angiogenesis in vivo, through the analysis of and miRNA transcriptomes of ex-vivo puri ed vascu-lar cells, in collaboration with Hoffman-La Roche. The results are ex-pected to help identify novel and more speci c molecular targets for therapeutic angiogenesis approaches. Fig. 1Connection to Clinical Practice Genetically modi ed progenitors for improved in vivo vascularization and tissue regeneration The goal of the group is to translate the basic biological prin- ciples controlling the physiological generation of normal and functional vascular networks into the design of rational strat-egies to induce therapeutic growth of new blood vessels. We are currently pursuing this concept in three main areas of clinical interest:1) To induce controlled angiogenesis in the myocardium and generate vascularized cardiac and FACS-puri ed VEGF-expressing adipose tissue-de-rived mesenchymal progenitors, in order to improve con-tractile function in the ischemic heart (Dr. med. L. Melly and Prof. F . Heckstein, Cardiac Surgery USB). 2) To achieve rapid vascularization of the inner core of clini- cal-size osteogenic grafts in order to favor progenitor sur-vival and differentiation, leading to improved bone forma-tion, by using VEGF-expressing transduced bone marrow-derived osteoprogenitors (Dr. med. R. Largo, Dr. med. M. Burger and Prof. D.J.

This kind of toxicity is named intrinsic or type A toxicity, is often related to the pharmacological action of drugs and is almost certainly detected during drug development. Another type of toxicity is named type B or idiosyncratic toxic-ity. Idiosyncratic toxicity is rare, mainly not related to the pharmacological action of a drug and usually not detected during drug development. Target organs are often liver and/or skin, but may be any other organ. Mechanisms are immunological (antibody- or T cell-driven) or non-immunological (meta-bolic) toxicity.Regarding the non-immunological type of idiosyncratic toxicity, many fea-tures can be reproduced in vitro cell cultures and/or isolated cell organelles exposed to high concentrations of a drug or drug metabolites. This observa-tion has led to the concept that patients with idiosyncratic toxicity have risk factors rendering them more sensitive to such drug effects. Our research in this eld has two principle aims: 1) to explore mechanisms of idiosyncratic toxicity in vitro and in vivo in animals, and 2) to nd out possible risk factors using cellular systems and/or animal models. One example is the toxicity of benzbromarone and amiodarone, two benzo- furane derivatives. Amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic drug, is toxic for many or-gans; one of them is the liver. The histological picture of affected livers shows fat accumulation, which is mainly a consequence impaired -oxidation of fatty acids. In an early study, we could demonstrate that the N-desethylated metabolites of amiodarone are more toxic for -oxidation than the parent compound. Since N-desethylation of amiodarone is mainly performed by CYP3A4, we assumed that a high activity of CYP3A4 may be a risk factor for amiodarone-associated cytotoxicity. To test this assumption, we overex- pressed CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells and studied cytotoxicity. These investiga-tions showed that amiodarone is indeed at lower concentrations cytotoxic in CYP3A4 overexpressing cells as compared to wild type cells (Biochem Phar-macol 2011;81:432-441). We could also show that cell death in this model was associated with impaired mitochondrial function, leading to cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Dronedarone, which is a follow-up development of amiodarone, also inhibits mitochondrial -oxidation already at very low con- centrations. In this case, however, the parent substance is more toxic than the N-desalkylated metabolites (Toxicol Sci 2013;131:480-90). Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis is a second area of interest. In a rst study, we could show that lipophilic statins are mitochondrial toxins and can induce apoptosis and/or necrosis in cultured skeletal muscle cells (Cell Mol Life Sci 2006;63:2415-2425). More recently, we demonstrated that statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis also in skeletal muscle cells and that this inhibition is associated with impaired O- and N-glycosylation of proteins (Biochem Pharmacol 2010;79:1200-1209) and with the inhibition of the activation of AKT, which is an important protein in the IGF-1 signalling pathway (Biochim Biophys Acta 2011;1813:2079-87). Subsequent studies showed that IGF-1 can prevent and up to a certain point also rescue cells from cytotoxicity as-sociated with simvastatin. We are currently exploring the underlying mecha-nisms associated with this observation.Selected Publications - Felser, A., Blum, K., Lindinger, P .W., Bouitbir, J., and Kra- henbuhl, S. (2013).

We then try to identify the mechanisms of the observed adverse reac-tion in suitable cellular systems. Once we have found plausi-ble mechanisms, we con rm it in suitable animal models. The nal goal is to go back to patients with the aim to avoid the adverse reaction by excluding patients with the suspected risk factor from treatment with the speci c drug.

Future projects will go into two directions. First, we will continue to study the effect of statins on skeletal muscle cells and on cardiomyocytes with a focus on the IGF-1 signalling pathway. We are also interested in the ef-fect of statins on the cellular proteome. A second direction is the effect of drugs and other xenobiotics on -oxidation. We will try to nd out biomarkers for impaired -oxidation using cultured cells and also animal models. For that, we are going to use a proteomic and a metabolomics approach. Furthermore, we will re ne the assays used so that we can lo-calize exactly where -oxidation is inhibited by speci c drugs and other xenobiotics. 62/63 Dermatology Prof. Dr. Peter H.

We hypothesized that these speci c skin lesions could serve as a useful marker for presymp- tomatic diagnostic of FAP . We prospectively determined the prevalence of cutaneous lesions in genetically con rmed APC mutation carriers and as- sessed their potential usefulness in the identi cation of FAP patients. In close cooperation with Karl Heinimann (Research Group of Human Genetics) a skin examination in 56 adult APC mutation carriers was performed and com- pared to a control group of the general population. In nearly 50% of all FAP patients we could identify at least one FAP-associated benign skin lesion, but signi cantly more prevalent were only multiple lipomas and combined skin lesions in FAP patients. Additionally, these skin lesions occurred at younger age in APC mutation carriers (Fig. 1). On some lesional samples we could test our hypothesis of a second hit in the APC gene, comparable to other genodermatoses. Although in single cases an additional hit could be identi- ed, the second hit model could not be con rmed as a basic mechanism in benign skin lesions of FAP . Another research line is the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), a type of malignant skin cancer, which is common in the general population and triggered by UV irradiation. Unique genodermatoses show an increased risk for developing these cSCC, for instance the epidermodysplasia verruci-formis (EV). EV is a rare autosomal recessively inherited skin disease leading to an increased susceptibility to particular HPV types. The disease is associ-ated with the increased risk for cSCC on the UV-exposed regions of the skin. It is assumed that EV functions as a model disease for the development of cSCCs also in the common population, but the pathomechanisms are not known. Our research in EV focuses on the identi cation of key mechanisms in the development of the EV-typical skin lesions as well as the cSCC by iden-ti cation of homologies and differences to common cSCC. Actual aspect is the expression of microRNAs regulating the differentiation and growth of the tumor. In contrast to EV, patients with a speci c type of ichthyosis (ichthyosis with confetti (IWC)) are not reported to develop cSCC. This is interesting as these patients, who are heterozygous carrier of a keratin 10 (KRT10) mutation, accumulate a huge number of chromosomal rearrangements during their life. We could show that the patients are born with an erythematous and scaling skin (Fig. 2A). During childhood the patients develop thousands of white spots on their skin looking like normal skin (Fig. 2B). These spots are the result of a loss of heterozygosity (LOH), which leads to cells containing two alleles of the KRT10 wildtype allele. Although such chromosomal rear-rangements are reported in cancer development, nothing is known about the cancer risk of patients with IWC. Future research of our group aims for identi cation of the mechanism underlying the disease and leading to a prog-nosis for the patients regarding their tumour risk, especially on the skin.

Molecular investigation of genetically deter- mined skin diseases Our research focuses on rare genetic skin diseases, which could function as a model for general mechanisms. Most ef-fort is applied to skin carcinoma development with the aim to understand basic mechanisms and identify new targets for tumour therapy. Patients who suffer from the related dis-ease are under medical treatment in the Clinic of Dermatolo-gy. Since all of our research activities is close-by the needs of the patients we also examine single families outside of carci-noma topics. For instance, we could analyse the germline mu-tation in a family without ngerprints. In cooperation with an Israeli dermatological research group we identi ed a specif-ic splice variant of SMARCAD1 responsible for developing ngerprints on the palms and soles (Fig. 3). The knowledge of the underlying cause of their skin disease is important for the patients, not only for estimation the can-cer risk but also for the interpersonal relationships as skin is an important mediator between human individuals.Connection to Clinical Practice64/65 Developmental Genetics Prof. Dr. Rolf Zeller Dr. Aim\u00e9e Zuniga Department of Biomedicine AnatomyUniversity of Basel Bud DevelopmentMouse GeneticsOrganogenesisSignaling NetworksSystems Biology Morphoregulatory signaling systems: functional analysis of their impact on gene regulation during normal and altered embryonic development We use a systems biology approach that combines mouse molecular genet- ics, transcriptome analysis and biochemistry with mathematical simulations to gain insight into the signaling and transcriptional networks that orches-trate vertebrate limb bud organogenesis. We study how progenitor cells are selected to act as embryonic organizers and how these control growth and patterning of limb buds. One of our main topics is to investigate how limb bud mesenchymal progenitors integrate various signaling inputs into a tran-scriptional response that regulates their survival, fates, proliferation and dif-ferentiation potential. For example, we have shown that the transcriptional regulator GLI3 initially regulates establishment of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling by the organizer in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme. GLI3 inter- acts with HAND2 as part of the transcription regulatory network that initiates establishment of an anterior and a posterior compartment prior to the onset of SHH signaling.As limb bud development progresses, GLI3 acts as a gatekeeper that reg-ulates the exit of proliferating cells toward chondrogenic differentiation (Fig. 1). In particular, GLI3 directly regulates the cell cycle and expression of the BMP antagonist Gremlin1 in limb buds. Our extensive genetic analysis has established that GREM1 is a key node within the self-regulatory signaling system that controls limb bud outgrowth and patterning. The highly dynamic Grem1 expression is regulated by a large genomic landscape that integrates inputs from at least three pathways (BMP, SHH, FGF). Us-ing 4C with ChIP-sequenc-ing, we are analysing how this integration works and how its self-regulatory feedback features are controlled. While this feedback system keeps BMP activity low during limb bud outgrowth and patterning, we have shown that high BMP activity is required during initiation for setting up the ectodermal signaling centre and then again at late stages to initiate chondrogenic dif-ferentiation.Other fascinating aspects of our research are briefl y summarized below:1. Evolutionary diversi cation of limbs in mammals: alterations in these sig- naling interactions not only cause congenital limb malformations, but also underlie evolutionary diversi cation of tetrapod limbs. We have recently been able to show that the loss of anteroposterior polarity and digits in bovine and artiodactyl limbs is due to degeneration of the cis-regulatory region that regulates the expression of the Ptch1 receptor in response to SHH signaling. This loss of transcriptional sensitivity to SHH underlies the evolutionary adaptation of artiodactyl limbs, which diverged from other mammalians ~60 mio years ago. 2. Relevance to engineering of cartilage and bone from mesenchymal stem cells: the molecular networks controlling the dynamic modulation of TGF /BMP activity during limb bud development are highly relevant to the so-called developmental engineering of cartilage and bone from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We are functionally analysing the mo-lecular similarities and differences of normal chondrogenic differentiation and endochondral bone formation in embryonic limbs in comparison to induced differentiation of mouse MSCs. 3. The role of developmental modulators of SHH and BMP signaling in cancer: our genetic analysis shows that aberrant feedback signalling un-derlies malignant progression of medulloblastomas, which are the most common and deadly juvenile brain tumours in humans.

Recently, we have obtained evidence that inactivation of Grem1 also lowers the incidence of medulloblastomas in Ptch1 mice. In summary, we combine systematic genetic and cell-biochemical analysis with in silico simulations to gain insights into the complexity of the signal- ing networks that orchestrate normal organ and tissue development and aberrant malignant progression of medulloblastomas. Fig. 1: The left panel shows the distribution of proliferating (green) and chondrogenic progenitors (red) in a mouse limb bud lack- ing the Gli3 transcriptional regulator. In the anterior part, mesenchymal cells continue to proliferate as their exit to chondr ogenic differentiation is delayed (upper part; left panel). This delayed exit from the cell-cycle and overexpansion of progenitors res ults in formation of additional digits (7 in total - an anterior polydactyly; right panel).

However, the brains of mammals regenerate poorly, failing to generate appreciable numbers of new neurons. This was thought to be due to a lack of stem and progenitors cells in the postnatal brain, including in humans. It is accepted that the adult brain contains neural stem cells (NSCs) and in some species continue to generate neurons. Newborn adult neurons in the lateral forebrain and in the hippo-campus contribute to olfaction and speci c forms of memory, respectively. Using conditional mouse genetics and cell culture we are trying to under-stand the molecular mechanisms controlling NSC activity and fate during de-velopment and adulthood. We are also trying to elucidate why active NSCs are lost in infant humans and during aging. Notch signaling and its control of neurogenesis We and others have demonstrated the importance of Notch signaling in regulating NSC maintenance and cell fate during development. Notch con-trols the expression of a cascade of transcription factors critical for progeni-tor maintenance and differentiation. Although transcriptional regulation of target genes is pivotal, we have addressed other mechanisms controlled by Notch signaling and which contribute to neurogenesis. We performed ge-nome-wide studies of NSC transcriptomes following ablation of Notch. We study a cluster of RNA-binding proteins and components of the microRNA pathway that are regulated downstream of Notch in NSCs. We showed that the RNAseIII Drosha and DGCR8/Pasha, key components of the microRNA microprocessor, play a central role in neurogenesis in the embryonic mouse forebrain. Drosha negatively regulates expression of the proneurogenic tran-scription factors Neurogenin2 and NeuroD1 through binding to and cleaving hairpin structures in their mRNAs to destabilize the transcripts. We continue to study the role on mRNA destabilization to expand our understanding of the targets of the Drosha/DGCR8 complex in NSCs of the mammalian brain. Diversity in the adult forebrain NSC population NSCs in the adult forebrain are con ned to niches in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and hippocampus (Fig. 1). Most NSCs are quiescent, prolifer-ate sporadically, and produce committed neurogenic progeny. The SVZ and hippocampus retain a remarkable capacity for repair indicating the impor-tance of NSCs in the regeneration process. We uncovered a difference in Notch dependence between active neurogenic and dormant regenerative NSCs. Loss of Notch1, one member of the four-strong Notch family, re-sults in a selective loss of activated neurogenic NSCs. In contrast, dormant NSCs are Notch1-insensitive until stimulated by a lesion to the SVZ. Hence, Notch1 is a key component of the adult SVZ niche promoting maintenance of neurogenic and activated NSC (Fig. 2). Using genetic markers and lineage tracing we addressed NSC heterogeneity in the adult brain. We identi ed subpopulations of adult SVZ NSCs (type 1-3) and found that activated NSCs express brain lipid binding protein (BLBP, FABP7) and epidermal growth fac-tor (EGF) receptor (Fig. 1A). They proliferate in response to EGF and are a major clonogenic population in the SVZ. We found a similar population of BLBP-expressing mitotic progenitors in the postnatal human brain and these activated NSCs are diminished in aged rodents and humans leaving only dor-mant stem cells.We also identi ed morphologically distinct NSCs in the hippocampus of adult mice that can shuttle between mitotic activity and quiescence (Fig. 2B).

Fig. 1: NSC diversity in the adult SVZ and hippocampus. A. Adult SVZ NSCs are Notch-dependent and express the canonical Notch tar- get gene Hes5 (green cells). The Hes5+ NSC pool subdivided into GFAP+ type1, GFAP+BLBP+ type2 and BLBP+ type3 populations which all show radial glia-like features and contact the lateral ventricles BLBP transient amplifying progeni- tor (TAP) markers (Ascl1) but express the EGF receptor and many are mitotically NSCs age and this correlates with reduced neurogenesis, reduced mitot-ic activity and a shift towards type1 NSCs. B. In the adult hippocampus type1 Hes5+ NSCs can be quiescent or mitotically active. In the intermediate progenitor (IP) driven model, NSCs generate type2a Ascl1 high IPs through asymmetric cell division. Type2a IPs undergo symmetric self- replicating progenitor divisions before generating a pool of committed progenitors (type2b cells) and give rise to post-mitotic neuroblasts and newborn granule cells. In our stem cell and early neuroblast-driven neurogenesis model, active NSCs di-vide multiple times to generate high IPs mitotic without ampli cation. The type2b early neuroblasts divide to increase and expand the precursor pool before generating post-mitotic neuroblasts and newborn neurons. The average time taken for these process de-duced from the lineage tracing experiments is shown in days. GL - granule cell lay-er, SGZ - subgranular zone. Fig. 2: Stem cell regulation of SVZ and hippocampal neurogenesis and regeneration. A. Neurogenesis in the adult SVZ is maintained by active NSCs (aNSCs) which divide slowly (dashed yellow nucleus). aNSCs depend u pon Notch1 for maintenance, self-renewal and neurogenesis, in the absence of Notch1, these aNSCs are compromised. Fast dividing transient ampl ifying progenitors (TAPs; yellow nucleus) express Notch1 and give rise to neuroblasts that migrate to the olfactory and generate neurons. Quiescen t NSCs (qNSCs) depend on RBP-J but not Notch1 They enter the cell cycle in response to injury to regenerate the SVZ. In the absence of Notch1, activa ted NSCs fail to self-re- new and effectively reinstate adult neurogenesis, resulting in a reduction of both qNSCs and a loss of aNSCs. RBP-J blocks cell cycle entry of qNSC and promotes aNSC maintenance. Slow/fast: Rate of cell division. PCNA: Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen. B. We identi ed three distinct NSCs in the adult hippocampus. These stem cell populations respond differently to pathophysiologi cal stimuli. Radial type1 NSCs are quiescent, remain in the hippocampus of aged animals and respond to physical exercise and epileptic seizures. Ho rizontal type1 NSCs are divided into active and quiescent pools and cells can transit between proliferation and quiescence. Active horizontal NSCs are lost during aging and expanded following epileptic seizure.physiological stimuli including physical exercise and epileptic seizures. We found that the age-related reduction in neurogenesis in the hippo-campus correlates with a loss of active horizontal NSCs and their transi-tion to a quiescent state rather than a loss of all stem cells. These geriatric quiescent NSCs can be reactivated to rejuvenate hippocampal neurogen-esis in aged mice. The selective response of NSC populations and revers-ible quiescence has important implications for adaptive learning and for regenerative therapy. 68/69 Experimental Hematology Prof. Dr. Radek Skoda Department of Biomedicine and Division of HematologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Dr. Adrian Duek* blood diseases charac- terized by aberrant proliferation of precursors of the myeloid, erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages. They represent clonal stem cell disorders with a tendency towards leukemic transformation. Currently, no curative therapy is available. MPNs comprise 3 entities: polycythemia primary myelo brosis (PMF). The goal of our studies is to advance the understanding of the molecular events that cause MPN and infl uence its progression to leukemia. A recurrent mutation in exon 14 of the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene that substitutes a valine to phenylala-nine at position 617 (JAK2-V617F) is present in a majority of patients with MPN, in particular PV . This mutation leads to constitutive activation of the Jak2 kinase and represents a driver for the proliferation of hematopoietic cells. Activating mutations in exon 12 of JAK2 have been described in pa-tients with PV that are negative for JAK2-V617F . Despite this progress, sev-eral questions remain unsolved including how a single JAK2 mutation causes three different MPN phenotypes, what other genes might be involved and what determines the progression to acute leukemia. We are examining these questions by combining three approaches: molecular studies in patients with sporadic MPN, genetic analysis of familial MPN and transgenic mouse mod-els that mimic the human disease. Analysis of clonal progression in MPN In a subset of patients with sporadic MPN additional somatic mutations can either precede or occur after the acquisition of JAK2-V617F . The order of events can be established by examining individual colonies grown from patient's peripheral blood. Using this approach, we found that there is no xed order of events between different gene mutations and a substantial proportion of patients even displayed two independent clones, i.e. bi-clonal disease. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that a clonal pre-JAK2 event is present in a subset of stem cells in these patients. This pre-JAK2 mutation predisposes these stem cells to acquire JAK2-V617F and in rare cases also to acquire other mutations and progress to acute leukemia (Fig. 1). We use next generation sequencing to ef ciently screen patients for the presence of more than one gene mutation and then determine the clonal architecture of disease using the single colony approach to compare this data with clinical outcome and prognosis. Familial predisposition for MPN Familial syndromes resembling MPN can be grouped into two classes: 1. Inherited disorders with high penetrance and polyclonal hematopoiesis. 2. Hereditary predisposition to true MPN, low penetrance, clonal he- matopoiesis and occurrence of somatic mutations, e.g. in JAK2-V617F . We identi ed mutations in the thrombopoietin (THPO) gene as the cause for an inherited form of thrombocythemia in several families with a \"class 1\" phenotype. In another family we found a previously described muta-tion in the gene for the thrombopoietin receptor (MPL). However, in the majority of families neither THPO nor MPL is mutated. The search for these disease genes is ongoing. Families with \"class 2\" phenotype are more common than generally assumed. These germ line mutations increase the likelihood of acquiring a somatic JAK2-V617F mutation. We are using genetic methods to map the locus for these pre-disposing mutations. Mouse models for MPN We generated JAK2-V617F transgenic mice that express a human JAK2- V617F gene. This conditional construct can be activated by Cre-recom-binase. Depending on the mode of Cre-mediated activation, these mice developed a phenotype resembling ET with strongly elevated platelet counts or a PV-like phenotype with increased hemoglobin, thrombocy-tosis and neutrophilia. We are using this mouse model for pre-clinical screening of Jak2 inhibitors and other potential therapeutic agents. Cur-rently, a major focus of our research is to examine the nature of the MPN initiating stem cells and their interactions with the bone marrow microen-vironment.Connection to Clinical Practice Improved diagnostics of MPN and new thera-peutic approaches: from bench to bedside (C. Bucher and J. R. Passweg) The rst challenge in the diagnostic approach to MPN is to distinguish between reactive changes (i.e. elevated blood counts secondary to other diseases) and true MPN (i.e. pri-mary disease of the bone marrow cells). In a second step, the de nitive category of the MPN, i.e. polycythemia (ET) or primary myelo -brosis (PMF), has to be established. The discovery of the JAK2-V617F mutation has completely changed the diagnos-tic approach to patients with a suspected MPN. Since JAK2-V617F is absent in reactive thrombocytosis, erythrocyto-sis or leukocytosis, the presence of a JAK2 mutation can be used to exclude such reactive changes. JAK2-V617F can be found in about 95% of patients with PV and in approximately 50-60% of PMF and ET and also in other chronic myeloid neoplasms, such as refractory anemia with ringed sidero-blasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T). Therefore, mutation screening for JAK2-V617F cannot distinguish between dif-ferent forms of MPN and blood counts, erythropoietin lev-els and additional parameters (bone marrow trephine and cytology, cytogenetic analysis) and search for less frequent mutations (JAK2 exon 12, MPL, thrombopoietin, Epo-recep-tor and others) have to be taken into consideration. We de-veloped a simultaneous multiplexed screening by next gen-eration sequencing that allows a molecular classi cation of patients with myeloid neoplasm.

The variety of nutrients in developed countries presents mod-ern humans with a problem: what are the best combinations of macro- and micronutrients that promote health and longevity in each individual? Why and how does an individual select among foods of different compositions and amounts when they are in surplus? Is food selection only due to par-ticular taste and odor receptors or are there connections among taste and metabolic needs for energy or regulatory processes? That is, is there a ge-netic basis for food intake? These basic science questions have signi cant implications for individuals and society since an increasing percentage of the population is obese or overweight.The gut \"tastes\" what we eat - sweet, bitter, fat, umami or amino acids - in much the same way as the tongue and through the use of similar signaling mechanisms. Indeed, the gut comprises a whole network of taste recep- tors and transporters in different cell types that cross-regulate each other's expression. The result is the release of gut hormones that help to control blood glucose levels but also communicate with the brain to control appetite and satiety when food reaches the gut. These taste receptors in the gut may therefore function as inhibitors of excess food intake, and their malfunction may play a role in the development of obesity, diabetes, and related meta-bolic conditions. This research has stimulated interest in these hormones as targets for the development of anti-obesity therapies. Our research focuses on the physiology, mechanism of action and interactions of the gut hormones GLP-1 and PYY as satiety hormones in relation to taste receptor activation in normal weight subjects and in patients with obesity before and after bariatric surgery to prepare the path for potential therapeutic application. Fig. 1: Schematic of the GI mucosal cell layer indicating the principal nutrient-sens- ing molecules ghrelin, CCK, fatty acids, peptides, amino acids, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides, as well as other sweet and bit-ter compounds, activate speci c G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and nutrient transporters expressed on the apical surface of enteroendocrine cells (green), brush cells (tan) and enterocytes (violet). This activation, via second and third messengers (not shown), leads to secretion of ghrelin, CCK, GLP-1 and PYY from cells into the GI-tract lamina propria. These peptides are then either absorbed into the hepatic portal vein and act on distal targets in an endo-crine mode, or act locally on neurons or other cells in a paracrine mode, or drain into the lymph. Note that activated non-secretory cells communicate with adjacent cells via other mediators such as acetylcholine, Peterli R, Steinert RE, Peters T, Bor- bely Y, and Beglinger C. 2011.

In addition, neurodevelopmental toxicity was selected as a model to understand variations in the differentiating potential of the ve human embryonic stem cell lines derived and characterized in our laboratory. In ad-dition, we are using induced pluripotent stem cells and long-term culture of differentiating embryoid bodies in closed bioreactors to unravel the mode of inheritance of insulin resistance in women diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome, which is closely linked to the metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. Using large data sets, either published by other research groups or created in our own laboratory, new genes or gene products involved in ovar-ian function are selected and their functions elucidated, most notably EULIR, an E3 ligase with af nity to the inhibin binding protein. As the EULIR-knock-out mouse created in our unit displays a strong phenotype, including neural tube defects and subfertility, we are now in the process of elucidating its function. EULIR regulates cell migration through its interaction with a num-ber of proteins involved in the formation and turnover of focal adhesions.

Heim Department of Biomedicine and Division of Gastroenterology and HepatologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Tanja to hepatitis C virus infection Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections become chronic in the majority of infected individuals, and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) can lead to cirrhosis and hepato-cellular carcinoma. The innate immune system is central to host-virus inter-actions during the entire natural course of the disease (Heim MH, Journal of Hepatology, ciently cleaves two important in the sensory pathways that react to HCV pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to induce interfer-ons (IFNs), mitochondrial anti-viral signaling and Toll-IL-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN- (TRIF). Despite this viral escape mechanism, the innate immune system strongly reacts to HCV within the rst days after infection. The sensory pathways, the type(s) of IFNs involved and the cellular source of IFNs are largely unknown. After 4 to 8 weeks, HCV speci c T cells are recruited to the liver. IFN- stimulated genes get strongly expressed in the liver (Dill MT et al, Gastroenterology, 2012). In about 30% of patients the virus is eliminated during the acute phase of the infection by T cell mediated anti-viral mechanisms. In the remaining 70% of patients, HCV persists for decades. During this phase, T cell derived IFN- cannot be detected any more in liver biopsies. Instead, in about half of the patients, hundreds of type I or III IFN stimulated genes become again strong-ly expressed (Sarasin-Filipowicz M et al, PNAS, 2008). However, this innate immune reaction is ineffective against HCV . Moreover, patients with consti-tutive IFN stimulated gene (ISG) expression have a poor with pegylated et al, Hepatology, 2011; Dill MT et al, Gastro-enterology, 2011). The viral escape mechanisms that protect HCV from IFN-mediated innate immune reactions are not entirely understood, but might involve blockade of ISG protein translation at the ribosome, localization of viral replication to cells with refractory IFN signal transduction pathways or to cell compartments that are not accessible to anti-viral IFN-stimulated effector systems. Recently, genetic variations near the IL28B (IFN- 3) were found to be strongly associated to spontaneous clearance of HCV and to response to treatment with pegIFN- and ribavirin (Rauch et al, Gastroenterology, 2010). The nding supports a central role of the innate immune in host-viral interac-tions (Heim MH, Nature Rev Immunology, 2013). The signaling pathways that link genetic variants of IL28B with immune answers to HCV remain to be elucidated. Selected Publications - Dill, M.T., Duong, F V ., and Heim, M.H. (2011).

Not only is one baby out of 1000 born with hearing loss, but more than 50% of over-65s suffer from hearing loss. Hearing loss of adult onset is one of the ten leading causes of disability-adjusted life years globally. Inner ear The complex architecture of the inner ear, named the labyrinth by early anat-omists, houses the senses of hearing and balance. The main functions of the outer and the middle ear are transducing and ampli cation of sound, while the cochlea in the inner ear is the auditory sensory organ. The cochlea propagates mechanical signals as waves in fl uid and membranes, and nally transduces them to nerve impulses. Its core component is the organ of Corti, which is distributed along the partition separating fl uid chambers in the coiled tapered tube of the cochlea. The organ of Corti contains 16000 hair cells in each cochlea. The outer hair cells of the organ of Corti are mechanically active, while the inner hair cells of the same organ convert the stimulus into neuronal impulses via afferent syn-apses to the dendrites of primary auditory neurons (spiral ganglion neurons). Hearing loss causes Hearing loss can be caused by damage to either external, middle or inner ear. Today, hearing loss caused by diseases of the external and the middle ear can be treated satisfactorily, while disorders affecting the inner ear cannot. Often, only prosthetic devices offer some help. For mild to moderate hearing loss conventional hearing aids are used, while for profound hearing loss cochlear implantation is the standard of care today. Loss of or damage to hair cells and/or neuronal cells, which are the sensorineural elements of the inner ear, results in a so-called sensorineural hearing loss.However, the hair cells are the most vulnerable elements in the cochlea, and damage to them is the most common cause of sensorineural hearing loss. When the hair cells are lost from the adult organ of Corti, spiral ganglion dendrites retract and are possibly lost. Total loss of hair cells can result in degeneration of some cochlear neurons. Hair cell damage may result from a variety of causes, including genetic disorders, infec-tious diseases, overexposure to intense sound and certain drugs. As exposure to intense sound, drugs and diseases accumulates with aging, so the loss of sensorineural elements in the cochlea progresses with it, and many individuals experience noticeable hearing dif culty later in life. Prevention of hearing loss? Hearing loss due to sensorineural damage has been recognised for over a century and experiments to promote understanding of the phenomenon date from the early 1900s. Since cochlear hair cells of mammals, unlike those of sh and birds, do not regenerate, sensorineural hearing loss is often pro-gressive and irreversible. Until recently, damage to cochlear hair cells and neurons has been regarded as an inevitable consequence of age, genetic conditions or exposure to certain environmental stimuli. This made avoid-ance of potentially harmful stimuli the primary means of protecting sensori-neural structures. However, in the last few years, progress has been made in the understanding of hair cell damage. Our laboratory is studying different aspects of hair cell damage and death: we are investigating the somatosta-tinergic system in the inner ear, molecular aspects of age-related hearing loss, and we are employing the cre-lox system to generate inner-ear spe-ci c knock-out mice of genes involved in hair cell death. In addition, we are studying guidance cues for spiral ganglion neurites, in order to enhance the interaction of these neurites with cochlear implant electrodes.

David Semela Department of Biomedicine and Division of Gastroenterology and HepatologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Dr. Sonja Rothweiler SignalingLiver VasculaturePortal HypertensionAngiosarcomaNotch signaling in the hepatic microcirculation Notch signaling in the liver The Notch signaling pathway is an evolutionary highly conserved pathway regulating fundamental cellular processes including stem cell maintenance, cell fate speci cation, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis during development and renewal of adult tissues. Notch signaling plays an indis-pensable role in embryonic vascular development with global knockout mutation, and Dll4 haploinsuf -ciency being embryonic lethal due to vascular defects. However, the role of Notch1 in the adult liver vasculature is not entirely elucidated. Our research focuses on the function of the Notch1 pathway in the ladult hepatic microcir-culation in physiologic conditions well is in chronic liver disease.The hepatic sinusoidal microvasculature is composed of a highly specialized and differentiated endothelium characterized by a discontinuous, fenes-trated endothelial lining without a basement membrane. The liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) comprise half of the nonparenchymal cells of the liver and play a central role in many physiological functions, including liver organogenesis, liver regeneration, control of the vasomotor tone, scavenger functions, blood cell traf cking, prevention of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) acti-vation, and production of paracrine factors such as hepatocyte growth factor and interleukin-6. Chronic liver disease can lead to endothelial dysfunction and dedifferentiation of LSECs with loss of fenestrations, deposition of a basement membrane, and surface expression of CD31, a process that has been termed sinusoidal capillarization and that precedes liver brosis. The determinants regulating the normal, differentiated LSEC HSCs as well as autocrine production of nitric oxide by endothelial NO synthase have been shown to be essential to maintain the phenotype of LSECs. However, other signaling pathways, the absence of shear stress, and interendothelial and heterotopic contact with HSCs might be additional important determinants of LSEC differentiation. We have therefore developed a Notch1 KO animal model in order to study the function of Notch1 in the hepatic microcirculation composed of LSEC. Notch1 required for vascular homeostatsis of the hepatic microvasculatureWe have previously shown of Notch1 led to nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) of the liver, in the absence of -brosis, with a persistent increase in proliferation of LSECs. Notch1 deletion caused transformation. Mx-Cre Notch1lox/lox mice had reduced endothelial fenestrae and developed portal hypertension and hepatic angiosarcoma over time. In contrast, mice with hepatocyte-speci c disruption of Notch1 had a normal phenotype. Notch1 functions as a tumor-suppresor in the liver vasculature Notch1 has been shown to be an oncogene in many solid tumors and in leukemia. Depending on the tissue type, Notch1 also rarely can func-tion as a tumor-suppressor gene (ie, in squamous cell carcinoma of skin and lung). Recently, blockade of Dll4 as well as loss of heterozygosity of Notch1 led to vascular tumors in animals. In our model, we observed persistent and cell autonomous LSEC proliferation, dedifferentiation, and eventually malignant transformation. Therefore, our ndings of sponta-neous development of hepatic angiosarcoma establish Notch1 also as a tumor-suppressor gene in LSECs.Connection to Clinical Practice Downregulation of hyperplasia characterized by small regenerative nodules without bro-sis and can cause portal hypertension. Aetiology and patho-genesis of NRH remain unclear. We have recently shown that Notch1 knockout induces NRH with portal hyperten-sion through vascular remodelling in mice. The aim of this study was to analyse histological and clinical data of NRH pa-tients and to explore if the endothelial pathways identi ed in our NRH mouse model are also regulated in human NRH. Patients were identi ed retrospectively from the patholo-gy database. Clinical and laboratory patient data were re-trieved. mRNA expression was measured in liver biopsies from a subset of NRH patients. Results: Diagnosis of NRH was con rmed in needle biopsies of 51 patients, including 31 patients with grade 1, 12 patients with grade 2 and 8 patients with grade 3 NRH. Grade 3 nodularity signi cantly correlat-ed with the presence of portal hypertension: 50% of the pa-tients with grade 3 NRH vs. 6.5% with grade 1 ( P = 0.0105). mRNA expression analysis in liver biopsies from 14 NRH pa-tients and in primary human sinusoidal endothelial cells re-vealed downregulation of identical genes as in the murine NRH model, which are implicated in vascular differentiation: (Dll4) and ephrinB2. In this NRH needle biopsy cohort, we demonstrated that advanced nodularity correlates with presence of portalhypertension. Downregulation of the endothelial signalling pathways Dll4/ Notch1 and ephrinB2/EphB4 supports the hypothesis that human NRH is caused by a sinusoidal inju-ry providing rst insights into the molecular pathogenesis of this liver condition.

However, the pathophysiological signi cance is not yet clear. The goal of this study was to investigate the extent of the changes that occur in SBP of the tibial plateau in the early stages of experimental OA.Forty-three female rabbits were assigned to 5 experimental (n = 8 each group) and one sham group (n = 3). OA was induced by medial meniscec- tomy in the right knee, the left knee served as control. 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks after meniscectomy, cartilage damage was evaluated, and bone min-eral density (BMD) and mineralization distribution of the SBP was measured by computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM). Cartilage damage started 2 weeks after meniscectomy with surface roughen- ing. Cartilage defects increased over time. 24 weeks postoperatively, sub-chondral bone was exposed. As early as 2 weeks after meniscectomy, BMD in the medial tibial plateau decreased signi cantly. BMD increased again and reached the values of the non-operated knee 12 weeks postoperatively ( g.1). In addition, already 4 weeks after meniscectomy a signi cant shift of the densitiy maximum on the medial tibial plateau, which is normally cen-trally located toward the margin was observed ( g. 2).In conclusion, the results of this study contribute to the concept of early in-volvement of the SBP in the development of OA. The hypothesis that chang-es in the SBP occur simultaneously to cartilage damage was con rmed. A comparison of subchondral bone mineralization between the gle- noid cavity and the humeral head Mineralization distribution of the subchondral bone plate can be used as a marker for long-term stress distribution in diarthrodial joints. Severe injuries or pathological changes of the glenohumeral joint often end in osteoarthritis, where shoulder arthroplasty has become the treatment of choice. The aim of this study was to investigate the mineralization patterns of both joint partners of the glenohumeral joint by means of CT-OAM and to com-pare them with each other. The material consisted of 57 shoulder specimens. To evaluate a correlation between age and localization of subchondral miner-alization maxima, the Chi-square test correlation test was cavities (86 %) showed a bicentric mineralization distri-bution with anterior and posterior maxima, only 8 glenoid cavities (14 %) revealed a monocentric mineralization pattern with anterior maxima. Forty- ve humeral heads (79 %) showed a bicentric distribution pattern with anterior and posterior maxima, 12 humeral heads (21 %) could be classi ed as monocentric with a centro-posterior pronounced maximum ( g.3).Herewith we could demonstrate that stress distribution in both joint partners of the glenohumeral joint is inhomogeneous and characteristically bicentric due to the physiological incongruity. Monocentric mineralization patterns can result as a cause of age-related loss of incongruity. Density and strength distribution in the human subchondral bone plate of the patella The aim of this study was to map the strength distribution of the human patella and correlate it to the subchondral bone plate density obtained by means of computed tomography osteoabsorptiometry (CT-OAM).Measurements were performed at 34 standardized points on each patella.

False-coloured distribution patterns for our measurements were generated. The mechanical strength was determined at the same points by indentation testing.We showed that neither the density nor the mechanical strength is dis-tributed homogeneously but exhibited regular, reproducible distribution patterns which mirror long-term stress distribution in articular surfaces. A direct correlation was found between both parameters in the subchondral bone plate. The correlation of density and mechanical strength makes CT-OAM a valuable tool to assess and monitor changes in vivo.

In par-ticular, we explore molecular mechanisms governing viability and regenera-tive potential of the myocardium by studying cues cardiac cells receive from their microenvironment, and how the cells are affected by these cues. The ultimate goal of our research is to advance therapeutic strategies for cardio-protection and regeneration. One major focus of our laboratory is on the interaction of cardiac cells with their surrounding matrix. Speci cally, we seek to identify novel adhesion-dependent regulators of cardiomyocyte and cardiac progenitor cell func-tion, and to delineate their role in post-ischemic myocardial remodeling. Previous studies from our laboratory provided novel insights into how the abundantly expressed laminin-dependent adhesion Rosc-Schl\u00fcter, 2012), which could be relevant for the control of the cardiac growth response and for cardiac tissue preservation upon injury. Besides cell survival, maintenance and restoration of cardiac cellularity require a delicate balance between proliferation and differentiation of cardiac precursor cells. We recently found that adhesion of cardiac progenitor cells and myoblasts to matrix proteins affects the intracellular distribution, stability and activity of Yes-associated protein (YAP, Fig. 1), thereby regulating proliferation and cell cycle progression of cardiac precursor cells. Adhesion-induced cell cycle regulation may represent an important step in the process of new cardio-myocyte formation, in particular at the site of cardiac injury, where matrix proteins are upregulated and cell density is low. Current efforts are focusing on the precise mechanisms and in vivo implications of YAP-associated cardiac progenitor cell regulation and on the identi cation of a possible molecular switch to gain control over cardiac cell cycle. Eventually, results from these studies could help improve regeneration of the injured heart. Another major topic of our research is to understand how fms-like tyrosine kinase to cancer therapy-induced cardiotoxicity ischemic heart a receptor tyrosine kinase expressed on hematopoietic progenitor cells and a regulator of progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. Flt3 belongs to the can-cer kinome and high levels and/or activity-enhancing mutations of Flt3 are present in acute myeloid leukemia cells, turning Flt3 into a major target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). TKIs can cause cardiomyopathy, but the mechanisms are incompletely understood. We recently identi ed Flt3 as a cytoprotective in Speci we oxidative stress-induced in vitro and in vivo and improves post-myocardial infarction remodeling and function in mice (P ster, 2013). We further identi ed cardiac broblasts as source of myocardial FL and found enhanced FL-secretion in response to hypoxia (Fig. 2). In addition, we demonstrated that cardiac progenitor cells express Flt3 and also secrete FL, raising the possibility that FL/Flt3 acts as an intrinsic para- and/or autocrine system in the heart. In fact, preliminary data support the hypothesis that in-trinsic Flt3-signaling plays a role in the regulation of cardiac progenitor cells. Further studies delineating the role of intrinsic Flt3-signaling in the heart and its implications with regard to cancer-therapy related cardiotoxicity and other types of heart disease associated with oxidative stress are ongoing.

Neurodegenerative stress such as mitochondrial dysfunction and associated oxidative stress as well as insuf cient ATP production are at the heart of RGC degeneration. These neurodegenerative stress conditions can be brought about by genetic mutation or individual predisposition together with environmental factors. But also pathophysiological conditions such as ischemia due to dysregulated perfusion or optic nerve compartmentalization constitute stress conditions leading to the death of irreplaceable RGCs.Our work focused on understanding basic mechanisms leading to neurode-generation in connection to pathophysiologically relevant stress such as optic nerve compartmentalization, oxidative stress or mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, to translate insight about dysregulated ocular perfusion and its connection to degenerative eye disease back into the clinic, the develop-ment of novel therapeutics in the form of transducible arti cial transcription factors to infl uence retinal perfusion and to treat associated diseases was at the center of our work. The optic nerve microenvironment The optic nerve is a part of the central nervous system and as such protected by meninges and cerebrospinal fl uid forming a speci c microenvironment. Meningothelial cells (MECs) are the cellular component of the meninges and based on clinical observation we hypothesize that MECs are involved in pathophysiological processes in the optic nerve especially during optic nerve compartmentalization. Our recent studies revealed that MECs are a part of the central nervous system immune response and are involved in cytokine release and phagocytic clearance of bacteria and apoptotic cells. Mitochondrial maintenance and degeneration of neuronal cells Maintenance of mitochondrial function is a multi-tiered process involving protein degradation, autophagic removal of dysfunctional mitochondrial subunits, and ultimately mitochondria-dependent programmed cell death, but also regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. We studied the role of the mitochondrial ubiquitin ligase MARCH5 known to be involved in the regu-lation of mitochondrial ssion and the degradation of proteins associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Joseph-Machado disease. We found that inhibition of MARCH5 function prevented mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis in cell models for elevated pressure, oxidative stress and A - induced neurodegeneration (Figure 1). Our data further con rms the mito- chondrial involvement in neurodegeneration and establishes modulation of mitochondrial ssion potentially through inhibition of MARCH5 as potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. Transducible arti cial transcription factors Regulating gene expression at will holds great promise for the treatment of many diseases. Advances in the understanding of zinc nger based natural transcription factors allow now for the generation of arti cial transcription factors (ATFs) capable of targeting any human gene with high selectivity (Figure 2). Depending on the transcriptionally active protein domain incor-porated into such ATFs, up- as well as down-regulation of gene expression is achievable. However, for ATFs to be useful as therapeutics, delivery to the site of action needs to be considered. By employing protein transduction technology further improved by us, we achieved ef cient delivery of active Figure 1: Inactivation of MARCH5 pressure induced mitochondrial mmHg) glaucoma-mim-icking (30 mmHg) elevated pressure conditions.

None of the diseases can be cured, only the symptoms can be controlled by anti-infl ammatory and muscle relaxant drugs. The pathogen-esis of chronic infl ammatory lung diseases is not well understood as the exist-ing theory of deregulated immune response cannot explain most pathologies suf ciently. Asthma affects more than 235 million people (www.who.int/mediacentre/ factsheets/fs307/en) and is a lifelong disease. Asthma is not curable, only symptoms can be controlled. Environmental triggers, mainly allergens trig-ger 55% of all asthma attacks. The remaining 45% are due to stress, exercise, or changes in temperature, humidity or dust content. In 1922, asthma was described as increased thickening of airway wall smooth muscle bundles. After decades of studying the role of the immune response in asthma the idea that altered smooth muscle function is a major asthma cause has been revived in the past two decades. Destroying smooth muscle cells by heat in patients with severe asthma kept them symptom free for 5 years. However, this form of bronchoscopic therapy can only be applied to few asthma pa-tients. To better understand the origin of asthma we isolate human diseased and non-diseased smooth muscle cells from bronchoscopic biopsies to study and investigate the conditions leading to the asthmatic phenotype. Together with our colleagues from Australia, Canada, Greece and Netherlands we observed that asthmatic smooth muscle cells produce: (i) pro-infl ammatory Wnt-proteins, and (ii) short forms of hyaluronic acid. Furthermore, the cells produce less of anti-infl ammatory semaphorin 3a. We also provided data in-dicating that the mechanism controlling the translation of the cell differentia-tion controller C/EBP-alpha from mRNA to protein is impaired in asthma and can be down-regulated by house dust mite allergen. Why this translation impairment is speci c for C/EBP-alpha is still unclear. COPD was the 4 th most frequent cause of death worldwide in 2008 (www. who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs315/en) with increasing prevalence. COPD cannot be cured, only the symptoms can be controlled and progres-sion might be slowed down by anti-infl ammatory and muscle relaxing drugs. In high income countries cigarette smoking is the major cause of COPD. In low-income countries the exposure to dust, smoke, and ashes (open re cooking, heating) are independent causes. Exposure to risk factors early in life (pregnancy, rst 6 years) increases the susceptibility to develop COPD later. The mechanisms that lead to COPD are unclear and involve the im-mune response as well as tissue forming cells of the small airways. Using human diseased versus non-diseased lung cells we have shown, that other cellular pathologies as in asthma can be found in cells of COPD patients, including: (i) deregulated C/EBP translation control by cigarette smoke, (ii) faster degradation of hyaluronic acid contributing to infl ammation, and (iii) lower response to the anti-remodelling action of steroids and beta2-agonists, which are the most prescribed drugs in COPD therapy. Our translational COPD studies are embedded in large clinical trials. Connection to Clinical Practice Translational research in infl ammatory lung diseases The clinical research is supported by a SNSF professorship and focused on large cohorts of patients with COPD, select-ed groups of patients with asthma, lung brosis and bron-chiolitis obliterans (GvHD of the lung) following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Risk factor analyses are performed and new biomarkers tested for predictors for exacerbations and survival of COPD patients. The clinical setting of a close collaboration of pulmonologists with other clinical specialists (thoracic surgeons, hematologists, pathologists etc) and ba-sic researchers as well as the close location of the clinic of pneumology and the DBM give us the unique opportunity to culture cells from the human lung of patients with specif-ic lung diseases. Human epithelial cell cultures, broblasts and bronchial smooth muscle cell cultures are taken from bronchoscopic biopsies and immediately processed. This approach allows to identify pathophysiological pathways of the diseased cells and to test new medications on a cellular level. Components of tissue remodelling are studied as well as the infl uence of allergic and non allergic stimuli. In paral-lel to the translational research projects numereous inves-tigator driven noncommercial randomised studies are per-formed to optimise patients safety during bronchoscopy in patients with and without COPD. Under the lead of the Ba-sel clinical research team collaboration with groups in Germa-ny, Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, UK, Serbia and Greece have been established.Prof. Dr. Daiana Stolz Pneumology, University Hospital Basel Selected Publications Hostettler KE, Halter JP, Gerull S, Lardinois D, Savic S, M, Tamm M.

Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) develops as a severe complication following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. We have been one of the few groups worldwide being able to isolate and maintain epithelial cells and broblasts from brosis and BO patients. In collaboration with the University of Bern we have recently shown that the differentiation of epithelial cells isolated from human lung tissue is different from that of non-diseased lungs. Our data indicates that IPF lungs contain larger numbers of pluripotent cells which display an epithelial phenotype, but can differentiate into a large va-riety of other cell types. Beside our studies to understand the role of these cells in brosis and BO we use these rare cells to investigate bene cial ef-fects of novel anti- brotic drugs.88/89 Prenatal Medicine Prof. Dr. Sinuhe Hahn Department of Biomedicine and Division of Obstetrics and GynecologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Nicole Traps (NETs) PregnancyPreeclampsiaInfl ammation pregnancy and auto-infl ammatory conditions (rheumatoid arthritis) The previous focus of our lab was on the analysis of cell-free DNA, liberated by dying cells into the circulation. Our speci c aim was to use this for the development of non-invasive tests for prenatal diagnosis, by exploiting the nding that during pregnancy, the placenta releases DNA of fetal origin into the maternal circulation. By the use of sophisticated genome sequencing ap-proaches this approach has successfully made the transition from bench to clinic, and is being offered commercially by a number of providers e.g., Se-quenom, Verinata, Natera etc [1].For this reason we sought a new research focus and have turned our atten-tion to a rather pivotal question that still remained, namely, what was the source of this maternal cell-free DNA and why was it elevated in certain con-ditions like preeclampsia? A hint of what the source of the maternal cell-free DNA could be was provid- ed by a fascinating discovery in 2004, which described that upon activation circulatory neutrophils could expel their nuclear DNA into the extracellular environment, where it could serve as a sticky trap to ensnare and kill micro-organisms. Consequently these structures were called NETs or neutrophil extracellular traps. Prompted by these ndings we investigated whether such events occurred in preeclampsia, and were startled to determine that NETs could be triggered in isolated neutrophils by treatment with infl ammatory placental debris as found in preeclampsia. We also detected large numbers of NETs directly in the intervillous space in preeclamptic placentae [2].Since preeclampsia is a highly infl ammatory condition, we were curious whether such events occurred in other auto-infl ammatory disorders e.g. rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In collaboration with Prof. P . Hasler, KSA, Aarau, we observed that the levels of cell-free DNA were much higher in serum samples than plasma, and that this was signi cantly different to the same analysis performed on healthy control samples [3]. As this difference was not evident in rapidly processed EDTA plasma samples, it implied that dur-ing the clotting process during serum generation, a population of cells was liberating their DNA into the extracellular milieu in an increased amount. We postulated that these could be neutrophils undergoing NETosis. Recently we were able to con rm that this suspicion via the detection of NETs associated neutrophil granular components in serum samples, as well as in culture supernatants of isolated neutrophils (Chowdhury et al., submitted). These studies furthermore implicated enhanced NETosis in the underlying aetiology of RA, in that the presence of the deiminating enzymes PAD2 and 4 on these extracellular structures may drive the generation of auto-antibodies against citrullinated peptides (ACPA).We are now focusing our attention on the regulation of NETosis in normal pregnancy, and how this is dysregulated under a number of different compli- cations (Giaglis et al., in preparation). In a collaborative study with Prof. M. B\u00fchler, FMI, we concluded our analysis of the role of miRNA in regulating trophoblast differentiation. This study in-dicated that the expression of miR-455 and miR-210 was sensitive to hypoxic conditions and their abundance was enhanced in preeclamptic placentae. Bioinformatic analysis of predicted targets suggested that MUC1 could be regulated by miR-455-3P, a feature we con rmed by gene transfections as-says. These experiments also linked HIF2A in this regulatory pathway (Lale- vee et al., in preparation). Prof. Dr. med. Irene Hoesli, PD Dr. med. Olav Lapaire University Women's Hospital, Basel Development of new markers to detect preeclampsia A major obstetrical concern is that no reliable diagnostic aids exist to identify pregnancies at risk for preeclampsia, as well as a number of other complications. In past experiments we examined whether the maternal plasma proteome can be ex-amined by quantitative isobaric labeling (iTRAQ) mass spec-trometric approaches. In order to evaluate the suitability of such an approach we rst examined pregnancies bearing a fetus with trisomy 21, as this involved the sole addition of a single chromosome, and as such was not as complex as mul-tifactorial conditions such as preeclampsia. This study indi-cated that this approach was feasible, as we detected quan-titative changes in concentration of known screening mark-ers such as betaHCG.In a subsequent study we extended this study and examined 1st trimester maternal plasma samples from pregnancies at risk for preeclampsia, in which we also detected potential-ly new screening biomarkers, as well as con rming chang-es in currently used ones. In order to extend the scope and variety of potential biomarkers, we examined for changes in gene expression in placental samples obtained from nor-mal healthy deliveries and those affected by preeclampsia.It is now our intention to establish a large biobank to test the ef cacy of our newly found biomarkers more rigorous-ly. In addition, we will determine whether we can enhance the speci city and sensitivity of current screening tests, for the detection of late onset preeclampsia. We will also deter-mine whether proteomic approaches can be used to develop new biomarkers for preterm labour or gestational diabetes.Connection to Clinical Practice Selected Publications - Gupta, A.K., Joshi, M.B., Philippova, M., Erne, P ., Hasler, Hahn, (2010). endothe-lial cells induce neutrophil extracellular traps and are sus-ceptible to NETosis-mediated cell S., Lapaire, O., Chool- ani, M., and Hahn, S.

T-cadherin (T-cad) is peculiar in structure: it lacks transmembrane and cytosolic domains and is membrane-anchored via a GPI moiety, implying distinct functions and molecular circuitry. We have hypothesized that the \"functional predestina-tion\" of T-cad is the control of tissue architecture through both \"guiding\" navigation of moving structures or segregation of functional tissue compart-ments and \"guarding\" integrity of functionally connected tissue layers. T-cad expression is altered in cardiovascular disorders and cancers. We focus on delineating T-cad-dependent cellular functions and signal pathway utiliza-tion in vascular and cancer cells, with the broader goal being to de ne basic biological mechanisms underlying T-cad-mediated control of tissue homeo-stasis. T-cadherin in the vasculature T-cad expression is upregulated on vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) and endothelial cells (EC) during atherosclerosis and restenosis. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches we have previously identi ed angiogenic and survival functions for T-cad in integrin 3. T-cad is shed from acti- vated/damaged EC as a component of microparticles (MP), which via homo-philic-based interactions can serve local/distal protective signaling functions during conditions of endothelial injury or dysfunction. These studies support T-cad upregulation as a modulator of survival/reparative behavior of EC in cardiovascular disorders. However, sustained T-cad up-regulation in EC can have deleterious consequences of promoting endothelial insulin resistance (Fig. 1). One explanation for the ability of T-cad to impact insulin signaling is that its adaptor recruitment activates signaling responses that converge with the insulin-insulin receptor (IR)-dependent pathway at the level of common intracellular targets. Alternatively, T-cad may directly increase IR pathway activity through T-cad/IR co-association in lipid raft domains. Control of the IR signal cascade by T-cad represents a novel cadherin-based signaling path-way at the crossroads of vascular and metabolic disorders. Current investi- gations address the contribution of T-cad to SMC (patho)biology. T-cadherin in cancer T-cad has been implicated in cancer progression primarily on the basis of ge-netic and epigenetic studies. We apply multidisciplinary in vitro and in vivo experimental approaches to understand the cellular functions and molecu-lar mechanisms of action of T-cad in tumour biology. Immunohistochemical analysis of human skin showed that decrease/loss of T-cad in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumours occurs in association with acquisition of the inva- sive/malignant phenotype (Fig. 2A). In vitro and in vivo investigations show that T-cad loss in SCC promotes cell elongation, cell cluster disorganization, motility and invasive/metastatic potential (Fig. 2B and C), effects which are due to enhanced EGFR pathway activity. T-cad gain or loss respectively re-cruit or release EGFR from lipid raft domains, suggesting that T-cad acts as a negative auxiliary regulator of EGFR in SCC. We postulated that modulation of EGFR activity by T-cad could be a regulatory mechanism common to other RTKs. Using several cancer cell lines including prostate and colon carcinoma cells we found that T-cad regulates activity of both EGFR and IGF-1R and their cross talk. This is relevant to evolution of drug resistance. Concluding remarksModulation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase activity and cross- talk may be a common mechanistic principle underlying T-cad-dependent control of vascular and epithelial (tumour) cells behavior (Fig. 3). T-cad dysfunction carries consequences for receptor complementarity and cell migration, proliferation, invasion, differentiation and polarity, which are key determinants of vascular (dys)function/remodeling and of tumour progression/metastasis.Connection to Clinical Practice Prof. Dr. med. Paul Erne Division of Cardiology, Kantonsspital Luzern Detection of early atherosclerosis and the vulnerable patient Atherosclerosis is clinically silent long before plaque rup- ture and ensuing cardiovascular events. Detection of pre-clinical atherosclerosis and the shift from \"indolent\" to acute ischemic disease has great clinical bene t, yet remains a di-agnostic challenge. Atherosclerosis pro ling using a multi-marker diagnostic paradigm comprising physical character-istics and lesional composition of vessels, endothelium status and speci c relationships be-tween these parameters could improve risk strati cation of patients and determination of treatment measures. We have compiled a wide-ranging clinical data base on a large co-hort of study subjects (including healthy individuals, patients without cardiovascular risk factors, and patients with differ-ent stages of atherosclerosis de ned on the basis of angio-graphic and IVUS data) and a corresponding bank of plasma samples and blood leukocyte isolates for biomarker analy-sis. We have established links between vascular shear stress and coronary vessel calci cation and between ED and mor-phology of coronary atherosclerotic plaques. We have also demonstrated that levels of plasma T-cad correlate with ED, invoking T-cad as a biomarker of early atherosclerosis. Cur-rently we are examining the link between oxidative process-es in the vessel and initiation of atherosclerosis, endothelial dysfunction and plaque burden by exploring the potential use of oxidized phospholipid species as disease biomarkers.Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3Selected Publications - Kyriakakis, E., Maslova, K., Philippova, M., Pfaff, P ., and Resink, T.J.

We have previ-ously identi ed the BMP-WNT-CDX-HOX signaling pathway as an essential regulator of developmental hematopoiesis and later on demonstrated in-volvement of CDX genes in human leukemia. Gene expression arrays per-formed on CDX2-modi ed leukemic cells con rmed HOX genes as targets but also revealed the zink nger transcription factor EVI1 as a putative down-stream molecule. Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) in leukemia EVI1 has been intensively studied in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) where high EVI1 expression, detectable in ca. 10% of patients predicts an adverse clinical outcome. Ca. 20% of the high EVI1 adult AMLs present rearrange-ments at the chromosomal locus 3q26 harboring the EVI1 gene, however in all other cases the upstream regulatory mechanisms driving EVI1 expres-sion are not yet fully understood. Associations with translocations involving 11q23 (the chromosomal region harboring the mixed lineage leukemia, MLL gene) or deletions of 7q- have been reported in subsets of patients.We recently reported that EVI1 also expresses in ca. 10% of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). Knockdown of EVI1 expression enhanced apoptosis in response to conventional ALL chemotherapies and suppressed leukemogenesis in murine xenotransplantion models. We are currently in-vestigating the molecular targets and regulation of EVI1 in leukemia and other putative mechanisms by which EVI1 infl uences disease aggressiveness (e.g. by regulating homing properties and the interactions between leukemic cells and their niches). EVI1 regulates developmental hematopoiesis In parallel to our studies in leukemia, we explore the role of EVI1 during hematopoietic development in zebra sh and in vitro differentiating human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. EVI1 regulates embryonic myelopoiesis and while not affecting erythropoiesis. Mecha-nistically, EVI1 exerts its effects partly through induction of the downstream gene GATA2. Currently we are exploring putative additional EVI1 targets and mechanisms by which EVI1 affects hematopoietic development. The role of embryonic stem cell proteins in cancer stem cellsThere is increasing evidence that solid tumors harbor so-called cancer stem cells (CSCs) responsible for disease initiation, maintenance, metastasis and relapse after conventional anti-tumor therapies. We hypothesized that the embryonic proteins SOX2 and OCT4, which regulate stemness in ESCs and participate in the reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotent stem cells also induce CSCs. In line, we could show that enhanced SOX2 expression associates with stemness, disease aggressiveness and therapy resistance in ovarian cancer. Furthermore, SOX2 expression was associated with the pres-ence of lymph-node metastasis in early-stage breast carcinoma patients, sug-gesting that SOX2-expressing cells have increased invasive and metastatic potential, both properties linked to CSC identity. Current research in the lab uses a newly developed GFP-tagged lentiviral reporter system to isolate and characterize SOX2-expressing cells, with the overall aim of identifying drug-gable CSC targets.

Beyond a potential clini-cal use as implants, the engineered constructs also represent invaluable 3D model systems to study progenitor cell differentiation and tissue develop-ment. The main scienti c questions are related to (i) the functionality of hu-man mesenchymal cells (mature, progenitor, stem cells) for bone and car-tilage repair, (ii) the effect of speci c chemical and physical environmental factors on skeletal tissue engineering, and (iii) the interaction of different cell types during ex vivo tissue morphogenesis. The projects, at the interface be-tween fundamental research and clinical translation, bring together the com-petences of biologists, engineers and surgeons. Beyond national (SNSF) and industrial programs, research is funded in the context of European consortia, which favor a strong international networking of the group. Main recent achievements: 1. Bone organ engineering. After establishing the capacity of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells to generate bone tissue through an endochondral ossi cation process, we further developed and character-ized an upscaled, 3D scaffold-based model that displays morphological, phenotypic, and functional features of a \"bone organ\" (Fig. 1). In collabora-tion with the lab of Prof. M. Manz at the University Hospital Zurich, we de-termined that the frequency of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in the ectopic ossicle is comparable to native bones, and the marrow from the ossicles is capable of reconstituting multilineage long-term hematopoiesis in mice. Generating bone grafts through endochondral os-si cation provides an innovative approach to tackle fundamental and transla-tional aspects of bone morphogenesis and regeneration, besides enabling a controlled investigation and manipulation of hematopoietic stem cell niches in physiological and pathological conditions. 2. Cellular graft manufacturing in bioreactors. Different non-invasive meth-ods using sensors have been developed for the monitoring and control of culture parameters and cartilage graft quality using an automated bioreactor-based manufacturing system. Implementation of these controls is essential to perform streamlined graft manufacturing in a regulatory compliant way for clinical applications (Fig. 2). In order to further improve the previously developed integrated system for commercialization, the spin-off \"Cellec Biotek AG\" was founded in 2011. Together with Cellec and 7 other partners, we coordinate the EU-Project BIO-COMET aiming at the development of a controlled, automated perfusion bioreactor to manufacture human cartilage grafts of 30mm diameter to be used in a multicenter clinical trial for treatment of articular cartilage defects in the knee of up to 5cm 2. The foreseen auto- mated process includes the digestion of a small cartilage biopsy, cell seeding on and expansion in a 3D scaffold and subsequent engineering of a cartilage graft. 3. Engineering 3D culture models. The direct seeding, expansion and differ-entiation of freshly isolated, primary human cells within the pores of 3D scaf-folds using perfusion-based bioreactor systems, bypassing the typical mono-layer cell expansion, was shown to maintain the tissue regeneration capacity of various human progenitor cells.

Valderrabano, Bieri) 96/97 DBM Focal Area Oncology The major goal of this focal area is to support and expand research in the eld of molecular and clinical oncology in Basel. In particular, we aim at bridging the gaps between basic, translational, and clinical oncology research ongo- ing at the University of Basel and the biotech and pharmaceutical industry in the Basel area. Ultimately, the focal area should enforce collaborative efforts and common projects between various research groups, research institutes and pharmaceutical industry and between different disciplines. An added value is seen in innovative projects that eventually pay off by being trans- ferred to a clinical setting. This research program relies critically on the par- ticipating individuals' enthusiasm and initiatives. The Focal Area Oncology is currently led by Professor Gerhard Christofori, leader of the Tumor Biology Group at the DBM, and Professor Christoph Rochlitz, head of Clinical Oncology at the University Hospital. The program focuses on two major areas: rst to support basic, translational, and clinical research by either generating additional positions or opportunities for oncol- ogy research by hosting new recruitments, such as SNSF Assistant Profes- sors within the DBM. In 2012, Professor Richard Herrmann retired from his position as Head of Clinical Oncology at the University Hospital and as co- leader of the DBM Oncology Program. We thank him for his continuous en- thusiasm and support of the program and for never ceasing to emphasize the importance of clinical observations and questions for basic research. The re- sponsibilities for patient-oriented clinical oncology research have now been transferred to his successor Professor Christoph Rochlitz. We are also very happy to see Professor Alfred Zippelius being appointed Research Professor of Clinical Oncology in 2013 to strengthen the transition between basic and clinical research. The second focus of the Focal Area Oncology is to increase communication between the various researchers, clinicians and pharmaceutical company representatives in Basel and to foster scienti c exchange and technological collaboration. Towards this goal, one-day symposia are organized to offer platforms for the discussion of research progress and for the exchange of ideas. Many members of the DBM Oncology Program are also engaged in the Basel Signaling Alliance, a center of excellence at the University of Basel, and they have been organizing two high-impact international research con- ferences on signaling and cancer: \"TOR, PI3K and Akt - 20 years on\" in 2011 and \"Membrane dynamics in physiology and disease\" in 2012. In addition, outstanding international cancer researchers are invited to present lectures within the \"DBM Oncology Program Seminars\", and impromptu guest semi- nars complete the seminar activities of the research program. These commu-nication activities have led to highly successful collaborations and research networks, notably beyond the borders of institutes and pharmaceutical com-panies. Prof. Dr. G. Christofori Department of Biomedicine Institute of Biochemistry and GeneticsUniversity of BaselProf. Dr. Chr. Rochlitz Department of Biomedicine and Division of Medical OncologyUniversity Hospital BaselFocal Area CoordinatorsMany of our efforts within the DBM Oncology Program have been part of in- ternational and national research initiatives that cover innovative approaches to cancer research and treatment, including research on cancer genetics and genetic instability, cancer epigenetics, angiogenesis and metastasis, signal transduction, cancer stem cells, tumor immunology, and novel therapeutic regimen. In the years to come, we need to further enforce scienti c exchange between basic and patient-oriented research. In particular, we need to facili- tate the identi cation of clinical problems for the design of appropriate and innovative basic research approaches and, on the other hand, to improve on the rapid translation of basic research results into clinical application.98/99 Brain Tumor Biology Prof. Dr. Luigi Mariani Department of Biomedicine and Division of Neurosurgery University Hospital of Basel Group Members PD Dr. (technician) * left during period Brain Tumor Development Tumor InvasionCancer GeneticsBiomarkerGlioma development: from biomarker identi molecular mechanisms Gliomas are among the deadliest malignancies, with a median survival vary- ing between few months for the most frequent malignant grade IV glioblas-toma (GBM), to over 20 years for diffuse low-grade glioma (LGG). Gliomas progress by invading adjacent brain tissue. The main goal of the Laboratory of Brain Tumor Biology is to understand mechanisms underlying tumor cell invasion. This involves the identi cation of biomarkers, genetic regulators, signaling networks and molecular effectors of tumor cell invasion that can ultimately be targeted to control glioma progression.Through an active exchange between clinics and research laboratory, we are directly collecting resected glioma biopsies that are used for genotyping and ex vivo cell culture. In parallel, we are entering personal; clinical; imaging, histopathological and molecular annotations to construct a comprehensive glioma patient database. This information is useful for stratifying gliomas into molecular subsets and allowing further identi cation of biomarkers that may reveal novel glioma pathways. IDH mutations in low-grade gliomas Four major genetic alterations have identi ed in LGG: IDH mutations (IDH mut) with MGMT promoter methylation ( MGMT met) in 80% in astrocytoma, or 1p/19q allelic loss, mostly in oligodendroglioma, each occurring in nearly 25% LGG and mutu-ally exclusive. IDH normally into 2-hy- droxyglutarate (2HG). Accumulation of 2HG leads in turn to impaired DNA demethylation, including of MGMT. We have analyzed the impact of these alterations in a retrospective study of >200 LGG. Molecular parameters were more accurate survival predic- tors than histology ( P<0.001). and MGMT- met ( P<0.001) was associated with favorable outcome for overall survival (HR=0.34, P=0.003), while the triple combination IDH mut, MGMT met and 1p/19q loss was even more (HR =0.19, P<0.001), and the combination of IDH mut, MGMT met and TP53 nuclear immunopositivity was a risk factor for malignant transformation (HR =2.76, P=0.048) (Fig. 1). 3q26 genomic alterations in glioblastomas We observed earlier an association between glioma invasion and SOX2 expression. SOX2 gene is located on 3q26, a region that also contains the glioma oncogene PIK3CA, and MFN1 and OPA1, 2 genes involved in mito- chondria fusion and hypothesized for a possible function in glioma cell inva-sion. The purpose of this project is to investigate a role for these respective genes in glioma cell invasion.Inactivation of SOX2, MFN1 and OPA1 promoted glioma cell migration and invasion, pointing to a possible link between mitochondrial fusion and cell motility (Fig. 2). Copy number assays of the four 3q26 genes on 68 resected GBM DNA revealed the highest deletion frequency for OPA1 (29%). Sur- prisingly, SOX2 showed frequent gain SOX2 function for maintaining glioma cell stemness may dominate over a role in inhibiting invasion. We are currently testing whether effectors of mitochondrial fusion MFN1 and OPA1 are under the transcriptional control of SOX2. Characterization of invasion pathways in neural stem cells and tumor cells There is increasing evidence suggesting that brain tumors originate form neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs proliferate, self-renew and differentiate into different brain cell types, but are normally not invasive and show lim-ited migration. We were able to induce normal rat embryonic NSC invasion by supply-ing Fibroblast Growth Factor 2 (FGF2) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 (BMP4). Invasion upon FGF2 +BMP4 treatment was accompanied by strong migration capacity (Fig. 3). In this combination, twelve upregu-lated genes such as SPARC, podoplanin and Tenascin-C were also found to be strongly present in resected GBM tissue biopsies. This model may therefore help to identify invasion pathways to be targeted for controlling brain tumor invasion. Fig. 2: The human 3q26 region in glioma cell invasion.

Immune cells also take a central role in metabolic disease and the progres-sion of cancer. Lipid modifying enzymes, such as the members of the phos-phoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family, have been shown to control cellular acti-vation states, and have been identi ed as promising drug targets.Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we have previously demon-strated key roles of so-called class I PI3K isoforms in innate immune cells, tu-mors and stroma. Simpli ed, class IA PI3K are activated by growth factor- and cytokine receptors, while the only class IB PI3K, PI3K , operates downstream of to recruit the plasma mem brane. Among other recent ndings, novel mechanisms of PI3K control, and the role of PI3K in allergy and obesity were the focus of our recent studies.In allergy, cross-linking of the immunglobulin E (IgE) receptor (Fc RI) by IgE/ allergen the release of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ) permeability, TNF- activates close- by endothelia, which then display cell adhesion molecules to facilitate the recruitment of mast cell precursors (Fig. 1). As described in Collmann et al. (2013), Fc RI signalling is relayed via PI3K , and genetic ablation of PI3K or PI3K inhibitors blunt mast cell responses. Moreover, we could demonstrate that mast cell recruitment, but not the degranulation of tissue mast cells cor-related with the severity of anaphylactic responses. Amending drug applica-tion protocols to this nding, orally applied PI3K inhibitor doses could by reduced by a factor of 30, as compared to doses used in protocols targeting tissue mast cell degranulation.In Walser et al. (2013), we could nally establish a mechanistic link between FcRI and the activation of PI3K : protein kinase C (PKC ), activated down- stream Fc activity, PI3K (p84). Inter- estingly, the phosphorylation site on PI3K revealed a molecular switch that seems to be conserved between oncogenic forms of PI3K and phosphory- in , mutations in the helical domain weaken the inhibitory interaction of the PI3K catalytic subunit (p110 ) with the p85 regulatory subunit, and lead to the constitutive activation of the lipid kinase.Metabolic disorders and obesity are accompanied with chronic low-grade infl ammation (metabolic infl ammation), which augment cardiovascular risk factors. In this respect, PI3K promotes early steps in the generation of ath- erosclerotic lesions in murine models of atherosclerosis. As demonstrated in (Fougerat et al. 2008), inhibition of PI3K activity attenuated plaque forma- was to hematopoietic linage. loss of p110 decreased in ltration into the intima. Once atherosclerotic lesions progress to narrowing of blood vessels through steno-sis, smooth muscle migration has been reported to be potentiated by PI3K - dependent signals (Fougerat et al. , 2012). The obesity-associated chronic low-grade infl ammation has been suggested to be the main cause of progressing insulin resistance leading to the initia-tion of type II diabetes in obese patients. It was also proposed that metabolic infl ammation impacts energy balance during the development of obesity.

PI3K kinase inhibitors have advanced to phase III clinical trials, and available drug-like small molecules include a wide variety from PI3K isoform-speci c inhibitors to molecules targeting PI3K-related kinases such as the mam-malian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Emerging from a collab-oration with Prof. Dr. B. Giese (Dept. Chemistry, University of Basel, now at University of Fribourg), PIQUR Therapeu-tics AG was recently funded as a Spin-off of the University of Basel to explore targeted therapies in oncology. This effort pro ts from expertise available on site, which is refl ected by the engagement of many members of the University of Basel (e.g. Prof. Dr. R. Herrmann, CMO; Prof. Dr. M.N. Hall, advi-sory board; Prof. Dr. A. Pfaltz, CTI collaboration; and more). Based on positive results of regulatory toxicology studies, PIQUR expects clinical trails to begin in 2014 (piqur.com).ment of insulin sensitivity in mice kept on a high fat diet. Obesity-depen- dent macrophage in ltration into adipose tissue was attenuated animals, and macrophage markers and infl ammatory cytokine pro les were reduced in white adipose tissue (Becattini et al. , 2011). An interesting outcome of this study was the observation that p110 -/- mice on a high fat diet accumulated substantially less fat mass than wild type mice, while calorie intake and non-adipose tissue mass was unaf-fected. The difference in body weight increase could be linked to an in-creased thermogenesis in p110 null animals, which was triggered by lipid kinase-dependent and independent pathways. Moreover, the lean phe-notype accompanying increased thermogenesis in p110 null mice was independent from PI3K activity within the hematopoietic compartment, as not the genotype of transplanted bone marrow, but the PI3K status of the host determined energy expenditure and oxygen consumption (Fig. 2, Becattini et al. , 2011; Wymann & Solinas, 2013). To match the increasing complexity of receptor- and cell-speci c, and sub- cellular lipid signaling, the ESF-funded project \"Tracking of Phosphoinosit- ide Pools - Key Signaling Components in Cell Migration and Polarisation\", short TraPPs, aimed to provide novel tools to dissect PI3K signaling. The TraPPs program was concluded 2012 with the EuroMEMBRANE Interna-tional Conference, \"Membrane dynamics in physiology and disease\" in Basel (Wymann & Simons, 2013), and is the source of novel chemical biol-ogy tools (Erhart et al. , 2013; Wymann & Schultz, of fluorescently la-beled bone marrow-de-rived mast cells shown in green) to endo-thelia was investigated in cremaster muscle blood vessels. Endothelia were activated by the injection of TNF- to simulate an in- flamed endothelial state. The left panel illustrates the capacity of wild type mast cells to adhere to endothe-lia, while cells lacking func-tional PI3K (PI3K -/-) in the right panel are non-adherent. This is due to the abrogation of the GPCR PI3K integrin activation signaling chain, and blunts the replenishment of tissue mast cells. As described in Collmann et al. 2013, targeting PI3K -dependent cell recruit- ment is an ef cient way attenuate an allergic response, which involves PI3K func- tion at the level of mast cell precursors and tissue mast cells. In the latter, a connec-tion of the high af nity IgE receptor (Fc RI) was shown to implicate a novel link be- tween PKC and PI3K (Walser et al. , 2013). Fig. 2: The loss of PI3K functions modulates energy metabolism. On a high fat (HF) diet, PI3K null mice display a higher thermogenesis and burn more calories, which results in a reduced body weight and fat mass, while food in-take and lean body mass remain unaffected (Becattini et al., 2011). Chime- ric mice were generated by the reconstitution of wild type (wt) and PI3K null (PI3K -/-) bone marrow -/- recip- ients. After BM grafting, mice were kept for 20 weeks on high fat diet: wild type mice then develop a prominent liver stenosis, while PI3K null mice do not. As shown in the right panel, this phenotype develops independent of the BM genotype, as PI3K null recipients of wild type BM are protect- ed against the development of a fatty liver. 102/103 Cancer Immunology & Biology Prof. Dr. Prof. Dr. Alfred Zippelius Christoph Rochlitz Department of Biomedicine and Division of Medical OncologyUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members PD Dr. Martin Buess*, (technicians) Cell ResponseAntibodiesTumor Micro-EnvironmentClinical Cancer ResearchTumor InvasionImmune modulation and cancer: implications for novel cancer therapies 1. Cancer Immunotherapy: Harnessing the potential of anti-tumor immunity It is increasingly appreciated that cancers are recognized by the immune system, and under some circumstances, the immune system may control or even eliminate tumors. Only recently, this concept has been reinvigorated by large clinical trials, demonstrating improved overall survical and, impor-tantly, durable responses in a subset of patients in a way not seen with many targeted therapies and cytotoxic agents. Of particular note, the latter may also modulate immune responses and augment host immunity. For example, selected agents increase the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells, inhibit the function of locally immuno-suppressive populations such as myeloid de-rived suppressor cells or trigger DC maturation. These ndings raise the pos-sibility that such agents might be effectively combined with immunotherapy to induce potent anti-tumor immune responses, destroy therapy-resistant tumor cell variants selected upon anti-cancer therapy, and, ultimately, im-prove clinical outcomes. We investigate mechanisms of anti-tumor immunity in a variety of different mouse models including syngeneic and genetically modi ed tumor models engineered to carry mutations in genes known to be involved in human cancer. Of note, the latter models resemble the hu-man disease both at the genetic and phenotypic levels. These models also provide the platform to experimentally perturb the tumor microenvironment by different anti-tumor agents; currently, their immunostimulating effects are poorly de ned. The aim of our research is to improve our understand-ing of the immuno-modulating capacities of cytotoxic anti-cancer therapies and pave the way for a rationale design of treatment algorithms combining cytotoxic anti-tumor agents with immunotherapy. 2. Molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion Our group has shown before that invasion of cancer cells is not only possible by single cell migration after epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but also by collective migration of cell sheets. The small glycoprotein podoplanin is a marker for collective invasion in squamous cell cancers such as skin, head and neck, lung and cervical SCC. We are looking at stromal factors (including those provided by the immune system and angiogenic cells) that may trigger podoplanin upregulation and collective invasion. By analysing serial biopsies from patients before, during and after therapy for squamous cell cancers, we analyze speci c signalling pathways involved in collective migration. In addition, we test the druggability of these pathways in tumor models in vivo. 3. Development of anti-cancer strategies in early clinical trialsThe focus lies on the investigation and development of treatment strategies, targets and delivery platforms in early trials in medical oncology. In collabora-tion with the Clinical Research Center (CCRC) at our division, we have pro- grams ongoing to create a pipeline of agents that can move into the clinic. In translational projects, we aim at de ning predictors of therapeutic responses and at understanding the mechanism of treatment responses and resistance. In addition, we de ne novel tumor antigens by analyzing the autoreactive antibody repertoire. The clinical programs include cancer vaccines, immune modulatory drugs, monoclonal antibodies, and nanoparticles such as immu-noliposomes. In collaboration with the Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine (Prof. Wild), a program is centred on radiopeptides against pep-tide receptors. In addition, to optimally develop novel anti-cancer agents, in particular immunotherapeutics, in-vitro assays are performed to study how Selected Publications - Burckhard T., Thiel M., Nishikawa H., W\u00fcest T., M\u00fcller D., Zippelius A., Ritter G., Old L., Shiku H., Renner C.

Conventional staging systems, based on TNM assessment, do not precisely predict clinical outcome. Improved prognostic markers are required to identify patients at risk of disease relapse. Several tumor cell-associated markers have been pro-posed and possible applications in routine clinical practice are currently be-ing investigated. During the last decade, tumor-associated stroma was also shown to play active roles in CRC progression. In particular, tumor in ltration by speci c populations of immunocompetent cells has been recognized to be signi cantly associated with favorable clinical outcome irrespectively of tumor stage, thus possibly representing a superior prognostic factor. Mecha-nisms leading to recruitment of these cell populations and underlying their effects on survival remain, however, to be clari ed. Furthermore, the modu-lation of functional activities of stromal cells by microbial products derived from gut fl ora has not been evaluated so far. We are interested to investigate immune-mediated mechanisms underly-ing the bene cial role played ltrating lymphocyte and monocyte subsets in human CRC. Understanding the complex network of tumor-host interactions in CRC may allow the identi cation of novel prog-nostic biomarkers and potential new therapeutic targets. Prognostic relevance of cancer stem cells or immunocompetent cells in CRC We have analyzed the prognostic relevance of cancer stem cell (CSC) mark- ers, including CD133, CD44, CD166, ALDH-1 and EpCAM, cells, such as TIA-1, CD16, PDL-1, and MPO, on tissue micro-arrays including 1420 primary CRC. Whereas ex- pression of CSC markers is not per se predictive of poor prognosis, in ltra- tion by TIA-1 + CD8 + T cells, CD16 + or MPO + myeloid cells is signi cantly associated to prolonged patient survival. Thus, tumor-associated stroma ef- ciently predicts clinical outcome. Impact of tumor-associated stromal cells on CRC progression We have characterized phenotypes and function of tumor-associated stro- mal cells CRC. TASC mesenchymal stromal cells and similarly enhanced invasiveness of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, by releasing proangiogenic factors and by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Role of CRC in ltrating IL-17-producing T cells Ongoing studies concern the analysis of CRC-in ltrating IL-17-producing T -helper cells (Th17). In ltration + cells, although not per se predic- tive of improved survival, strongly correlates with that of clinically relevant CD8 + T cells, MPO + and CD16 + myeloid cells. We found that Th17-derived chemokines contribute directly or indirectly to the recruitment of these ben-e cial cell populations into tumor tissues. Characterization of tumor-in ltrating monocyte subsets in CRC We have recently observed that in healthy donors distinct peripheral blood monocyte subsets, identi ed by differential expression of CD16 and differentially expand speci c T cells, including IFN- -producing T helper cells (Th1), Th17 and regulatory T cells (Tregs), also depending on presence or absence of microbial stimuli. Since in CRC, tumor-in ltrating CD16 + myeloid cells, possibly including monocytes, are associated to Th17 cells, we are now investigating the ability of CRC-in ltrating monocyte subsets to expand dif-ferent exposure to gut fl ora-derived microbial stimuli.

Both processes take advantage of a tight spa-tio-temporal control of cytoskeletal and adhesion dynamics, with signaling events that operate on length and time scales of single microns and tens of seconds. One current limitation is that these biologically relevant scales are not accessible with traditional biochemical and cell biological approaches. We are broadly interested in different signaling networks regulating the two processes mentioned above with the focus to design and implement novel technologies to grasp their spatio-temporal dynamics at relevant biological scales. Genetically-encoded biosensors to measure signaling events in time and space We have devised a novel toolkit to rapidly construct genetically-encoded, fl uorescence resonance energy transfer-based biosensors for a wide variety of signaling molecules. Our approach enables to visualize micrometric sig-naling domains that fl uctuate of time scales of tens of seconds. By example, the GTPase RhoA is speci cally activated at the tip of F-actin bundles in neu-ronal growth cone lopodia (Figure 1) or at the leading edge of migrating broblasts. Rac1 and Cdc42 are activated at overlapping but distinct regions within the growth cone. This degree of precision cannot be matched by any biochemical measurement. In the case of the MAP kinase ERK, the biosen- sor revealed signaling noise within a population of cells, which was not pre- viously accessible using western blot-based measurements cell population averages. Previous work has proposed that duration of the pERK signal in response to different growth factors regulate cell fate decision such as dif-ferentiation or proliferation. We observe that these growth factor-induced signaling responses are extremely heterogeneous when analyzed at the single cell level (Fig.2). This explains the phenotypic \"fate\" noise observed in a population of cells: a given growth factor will not lead to homogeneous proliferation or differentiation within the cell population, but rather a mix of multiple behaviours. Thus, our biosensors provide a novel approach to un-derstand signaling dynamics at relevant biological scales. Local mRNA translation during neurite outgrowth We have performed a genome-wide screen for mRNAs enriched within neu-ronal growth cones. We have found that the MKK7 mRNA, which encodes a MAPKK for JNK, is locally translated within the growth cone. This leads to speci c activation of JNK within the neurite, where it regulates microtubule bundling necessary for robust neurite outgrowth (Figure 3). This provides a spatio-temporal signaling mechanism to speci cally couple JNK signaling to regulation of microtubules, and to uncouple it from regulation of cellular stress. Spatio-temporal signaling programs during neuronal guidance We are currently studying a large signaling network of 220 neurite-localized proteins that regulate the cytoskeleton, identi ed using a proteomic ap-proach. siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins only leads to very subtle phenotypes that can only be grasped using timelapse imaging of Selected Publications - Feltrin, D., Fusco, L., Witte, H., Moretti, E., and Growth cone MKK7 MAP1b-dependent bundling to Fritz, Martin, L., Ponsioen, B., Fluri, E., Schulte-Merker, S., van Rheenen, J., et al.

For that purpose, we have combined high content live cell imaging, computer-vision based image and statisti-cal analyses, and identi ed a number of regulatory networks regulating neurite initiation, extension, branching, collapse, etc. This emphasizes the need of a system biology approach to understand these complex net-works.Fibroblast cell migration. We have identi ed a highly persistent broblast migration mode. We observe that speci c cytoskeletal structures act as a spatial organizer, that allows to constantly polarize the cell and to specify different subcellular zones involved in membrane protrusion or tail retrac-tion. We have identi ed a leading edge-localized, collision sensor, that allows to sense when two migrating cells encounter each other.

Our research aims to un-derstand the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic alterations to de ne novel therapeutic strategies. In the past, we have shown that the un-controlled activity of PIM protein kinases contributes to proliferation and sur-vival of leukemia/lymphoma cells and characterized several small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors with anti-cancer potential (Brault et al., 2012). Unex-pectedly, we found that PIM1 regulates homing and migration of leukemic stem cells by modi cation of the CXCR4 chemokine surface receptor that is highly expressed on AML blasts. PIM1 phosphorylates the intracellular tail of CXCR4 predominantly at Serine-339 leading to increased recycling of the re- ceptor and enhanced cell migration. Recently, we were able to demonstrate that phosphorylation of CXCR4-Serine339 is important for mobilization of leukemic cells and of prognostic signi Alicia Rovo, UHB). In more than 50% of AML patients the leukemic cells harbor chromosomal translocations that often lead to the expression of fusions genes which en-code for epigenetic transcriptional regulators like mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) or nuclear receptor set domain proteins (NSD1) which are hallmarks of aggressive AML with poor prognosis. Using a retroviral bone marrow expression and transplant model we identi ed meningioma 1 (MN1) as a collaborating oncogene for acute leukemia induced by the MLL-ENL fusion (Liu et al. 2010). In order to address how the cellular origin of these fusions might affect the outcome of the disease, we have established transgenic mouse lines allowing the conditional activation of several MLL fusions at a de ned stage of hematopoiesis. So far, our results suggest that activation of the leukemogenic driver oncogene in hematopoietic stem cells leads to a signi cantly more aggressive disease than induction in more differentiated myeloid progenitor cells (collaboration with Antoine Peters, FMI). In contrast to protein kinases it was for a long time thought that transcrip-tional regulators could not be pharmacologically controlled. However, im-proved structural molecular analysis resulted in the identi cation of several small molecules selectively interfering and blocking the activity of transcrip-tional regulators. Gene transcription is infl uenced by local loosening of the chromatin through reversible modi cation of the histone proteins. These \"histone marks\" are recognized by transcriptional (co)-regulators by distinct structural motifs including bromodomains (BRD). Resolving the structure of most existing BRDs allowed the identi cation of selectively interacting small molecules with potent anti-leukemic activity (Picaud et al., 2013)(collabora-tion with Stefan Knapp, SGC, Oxford). Leukemogenic fusions often function in large multi-protein complexes, e.g. the activity of MLL-fusions is dependent on the interaction with several adapter proteins like the lens epithelial-derived growth factor (LEDGF) (Fig. 2). Interestingly, LEDGF is also known as being essential for integration of the HIV-virus into host chromatin. In collaboration with Zeger Debyser (KU, Leuven), we have identi ed the domains of LEDGF that are essential for its interaction with MLL-fusions. Overexpression of small LEDGF-derived pep-tides was able to disrupt the complex and to impair MLL-mediated transfor-mation in cell lines as well as in mouse leukemia models. These observations initiated a currently ongoing screen for small molecules that might be able to imitate these anti-leukemic effects (Mereau et al., 2013).

Fig. 1: Molecular genetics of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) AML is the product of a limited number of driver mutations (e.g. fusion genes, point mutations or deletions) in chromatin modi ers, transcription factors, regula-tors of the splicing machinery, tumor suppressors, members of the cohesion com-plex, and regulators of DNA methylation. Alterations in these pathways often oc-cur in combination with mutated signaling mediators of which the constitutively activated FLT3-ITD receptor tyrosine kinase is among the most prevalent. Our lab is particularly interested in leukemogenic alterations of chromatin modi ers such as mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) or the nuclear receptor interacting SET do-main proteins (NSD1-3).

The overall prognosis is poor due to the lack of reliable screening tools (e.g. tumor markers), the heterogeneity of the disease and the unknown origin of this cancer. Our research focus (both basic and translational) covers the ge-netic origin of gynecological cancers, in particular ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancers, the molecular biology of the development of these cancers, and the identi cation of diagnostic/prognostic predictors and therapeutic targets. Our research is translational and utilizes modern high-throughput technolo-gies and our previously established cohort of 800 Swiss and 800 Australian healthy and gynecological cancer patients, which is linked to a large biobank and comprehensive clinicopathological data. We have moved from Sydney, where we have worked in the Lowy Cancer Centre (University of New South Wales) for the past ve years, and joined the DBM in July 2012.Anti-glycan antibodies. Glycobiology is a relatively new and continuously growing eld in cancer research and believed to foster the understanding of cancer development and the identi cation of novel tumor markers. We were the rst research group who used a printed glycan array (PGA) approach to screen blood and ascites of a Swiss cohort of 250 patients for diagnostic anti-glycan antibodies (AGA). The results showed that naturally occurring AGA to P 1, a glycosphingolipid, discriminate healthy women from ovarian cancer patients with a sensitivity and speci city comparable to that of the current tu-mor marker CA125 (Jacob et al., 2012a). These ndings and method- 2011a; et al., (manuscript submitted). The validation technology, our in-house designed multiplex suspension array (SA), is based on fl uores-cently-labeled polystyrene microspheres as solid support for unique carbo- ligands and combines the advantages of fl ow-cytometric multiplex SA and advanced carbohydrate chemistry. This technology allows to pro le and to detect naturally occurring tumor associated anti-glycan antibodies si-multaneously in human serum. Preliminary data also indicate that it is the IgM-subtype of the AGA identi ed in the PGA that discriminates between healthy individuals and cancer patients.We are currently investigating the signi cance and biological function of our top candidate P 1 in ovarian cancer: Is P 1 glycosphingolipid expressed speci - cally on the surface of ovarian cancer cells (both tissue and cell lines)? Can naturally occurring AGA directed against P 1 antigen be isolated from ascites and do these AGA bind to naturally expressed P 1 present on ovarian can- cer cell lines? Is P 1 implicated in malignant transformation and other cellular processes such as proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion? We also investigate the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the synthesis of P 1, with particular focus on expression regulation of A4GALT (encodes the key glyco- syltransferase in of P 1 synthesis), the processes leading to the presence of P 1 on the cell surface, and the potential of P 1 as a prognostic/diagnostic marker and as a therapeutic target, for instance for anti-P 1-antibody drug conjugates. We are also aiming to optimize the current version of glycan-based SA in order to maximally reduce experimental background and exclude false-pos-itive/negative results due to antibody cross-reactivity, as well as to bring it closer to clinics. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) modi cations will be applied to the molecular construct on bead surface and PEG-modi ed beads are ex-pected to exhibit reduced binding to off-target antibodies.Endometriosis and drug resistance.

Respective strain ratios show that the average ratio for malignant were 2-fold higher but not statistically signi cant. The strain ratio is thus an unsuitable indicator to decide in favor or against an inva-sive diagnostic assessment. Atomic force microscopy of bi-opsies show that tumor tissue is less stiff than benign, sug-gesting this nanomechanical \" ngerprint\" as diagnostic value (Plodinec et al. 2012, Nat Nanotech). Our retrospective study of patients with adnexal mass detected by US (1998-2012) revealed that a risk of malignancy index (RMI) of < 200 in- dicates a high probability that adnexal mass is not invasive ovarian cancer. RMI calculation is an inexpensive, reliable, and easy-to-use tool for management of adnexal masses and triage for surgery.

Mutations in PTEN, p53, KRAS, and only recently ARID1A are suspected to play a role in the malignant transformation of endometriosis towards endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancers. We have recently shown in a TMA-study that ARID1A expression is lost in ovarian endometrioses (Samartzis et al., 2012, Mod Pathol). However, more studies are needed to learn whether loss of ARID1A may be diagnostic factor for risk of malignant transforma-tion. Innate and - in particular - acquired (during treatment; e.g. with cisplatin) drug resistance, is a major obstacle in ovarian cancer therapy. An ongoing project (collaboration with the Lowy Cancer Research Cen-tre, Sydney) addresses the ef cacy of novel polyarsenic-adamantane compounds in DNA repair-de cient, drug resistant ovarian cancer cells. Our preliminary results indicate that these compounds retain ef cacy in these resistant cells. These promising compounds are currently tested in a mouse model. Wnt-signaling pathway. In recent studies we identi ed the Wnt-sig- naling pathway, a pathway essential for the development, differentiation, polarity, migration, adhesion and survival, to be involved in ovarian can-cer development. We found that expression of secreted frizzled related protein 4 (SFRP4), a Wnt signaling antagonist, is lost in ovarian cancer pa-tients and is strongly linked with survival (Jacob et al., 2012b). I addition, SFRP4 is involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Ford et al., 2013, PLoS ONE). Recently, we demonstrated that the non-canonical Wnt ligand, Wnt5a, is upregulated in the same cohort of epithelial ovar-ian cancer patients and that with stronger expression patients had shorter relapse-free and disease-speci c survivals (manuscript submitted). We are currently investigating Ror2, a recently described and evolutionary conserved receptor tyrosine kinase, structurally related to the Frizzled re-ceptors and assumed to act as the speci c receptor for Wnt5a. Candidate gene approaches. Modern high-throughput technologies for transcriptomics permit the analysis of the expression of thousands of genes in one experiment within a speci c biological system. This allows the profound insight into the heterogeneous genetic background of a dis-ease and, combined with the consideration of clinicopathological param-eters of patients, the identi cation of novel candidate tumor markers as well as new diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic targets. Our previous-ly investigated markers include HE4 (Fig. 1) (Jacob et al., 2011) and GAS6 (B\u00fchler et al., 2013, Biomed Res Int). Using our previously constructed tissue microarrays we are currently examining by immunohistochemis-try the protein expression of MELK, a serine/threonine protein kinase, CXADR, a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and a component of vertebrate tight junctions, and CD47, a widely expressed cell surface receptor that serves as a counter-receptor for signal regulatory protein- and as a receptor for the secreted protein thrombospondin-1.

The group has a long-standing focus on hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes and has recently also included ge-netically complex neuropsychiatric disorders and developmental delay as research subjects. Hereditary colorectal cancer syndromes Our group predominantly focused on Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome during the reporting period. We identi ed APC germ line mosaicism in two unrelated patients with classical polyposis coli in whom neither full Sanger sequencing nor gene dosage analysis on leucocyte-derived DNA could identify a pathogenic APC mutation. Using the protein truncation test (PTT), a technique largely replaced by DNA-sequencing, we were able to identify two novel, pathogenic APC alterations present in a mo- saic state, at blood levels (1-15%) below the detection limits of conventional Sanger sequencing consequently allowing carrier testing in both families (Fig. 1). The ndings demonstrate the value of the PTT in identifying mosaic mutations in apparently APC mutation negative FAP patients with de novo classical polyposis and the need to keep it within the diagnostic repertoire for APC mutation analysis (Necker et al., 2011). Whether or not breast cancer is part of Lynch syndrome, an autosomal domi-nant cancer predisposition caused by mutations in DNA mismatch repair (MMR) genes, is a heavily debated issue. In 92 Swiss female MMR muta- tion carriers we observed that in contrast to endometrial and ovarian cancer, which occurred signi cantly more often and at younger age in mutation carri-ers (median 50.5 and 49.0 years; P < 0.00001), overall cumulative breast can- cer incidence closely mirrored the one in the Swiss population (56.5 years). We found that 6 (85.7%) of seven breast cancer specimens available for mo-lecular investigations displayed the hallmarks of MMR de ciency. Combined with data from the literature, MSI was present in 26 (70.3%) of 37 and altered MMR protein expression in 16 (72.7%) of 22 breast cancer specimens from proven MMR mutation carriers, strongly suggesting that MMR de ciency plays a pivotal role for breast cancer development in Lynch syndrome (Buerki et al., 2012). Neuropsychiatric disorders We have systematically sought after genetic risk factors for common neuro-psychiatric disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression) by performing genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Our GWAS of bipo- lar disorder is a successful example of this strategy (Cichon et al., 2011). The strongest association signal was identi ed at the gene neurocan (NCAN), located on chromosome 19 (Fig. 2). The gene is highly expressed in corti-cal and hippocampal areas in mice, regions previously implicated in bipolar disorder in a variety of neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and postmortem studies. NCAN expression peaks during embryonal development and sig- ni cantly drops after birth. The gene product obviously plays a crucial role in adhesion and migration of neuronal cells (Cichon et al., 2011).

These results suggest that there is a stronger genetic overlap between these two common psychiatric dis-orders than previously thought. In fact, recent collaborative studies (in-cluding our patient and control samples) that systematically looked for shared risk variants between ve different common psychiatric disorders found that a relatively high proportion of speci c risk variants confers a risk to different phenotypes, i.e. show pleiotropic effects (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium, 2013). Neurodevelopmental delay In this clinically oriented research part, genotype-phenotype correlations as well as disease gene identi cation studies were performed in patients and families recruited in our clinical service (e.g. Filges et al., 2011).

They have a potential to chemically mod-ify the DNA, thereby altering its coding properties and promoting genetic mutation. Such \"damage\" to DNA, however, does not only occur through random chemical reactions but also by the action of enzymes, in wich case the purpose is to speci cally increase genetic variance or alter cell fate deter-mining epigenetic signatures, i.e. DNA methylation. Modi cations of either kind occur thousands of times in our DNA every day and need to be con-trolled if the genetic and epigenetic makeup of cells is to be maintained. We explore biological processes that enforce stability to the structure and func-tion of the genome. Our objective is to provide a thorough understanding of the mechanisms involved and the consequences of their dysfunction for cell identity, transformation and cancer. Genetic and epigenetic maintenance by DNA base excision repair A main focus of our recent work has been the clari cation of the biological function of the DNA repair enzyme \"Thymine DNA Glycosylase\" (TDG). TDG rst caught our attention because of its ability to hydrolyze thymine or uracil from T \u0081G and U \u0081G DNA mismatches. These mismatches arise >U) or 5-methylC >T) and, un- less repaired, will generate C >T mutations, the most prevalent nucleotide change found in human cancers. By its enzymatic activity, TDG is implicated in the antimutagenic repair of these mismatches, but this function has never been corroborated by genetic evidence.We have been pursuing various approaches to unravel the biological func-tion of TDG and made important discoveries along the way. Through pro- tein interaction studies, we found that SUMO-conjugation is required for full functionality of TDG and thereby established a novel mechanistic para-digm for coordination of DNA repair processes. Through genetic work, we learned that base excision by TDG contributes critically to the DNA toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-FU and were able to elucidate the underly-ing molecular mechanism. A breakthrough in understanding TDG function, however, came with the nding that TDG is essential for mouse embryonic development. We showed that this unexpected phenotype refl ects a role of TDG in controlling DNA methylation dynamics in differentiating cells, rather than a defect in mutation avoidance, thus expanding the biological func-tion of DNA repair from the genetic to an epigenetic level. The underlying mechanisms became evident with recent discoveries by others of proteins (TET1-3) capable of oxidatizing 5-methylC to 5-formyl- and 5-carboxylC in DNA, both of which are substrate for base excision by TDG. The role of this TET-TDG axis of active DNA demethylation in the establishment of cell iden- tity and in carcinogenesis is subject of current research. Cancer epigeneticsAberrant CpG methylation contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating of the genome. Exactly why, how and when DNA methylation changes arise during carcinogenesis is unknown. We aim to identify genetic and environ-mental conditions controlling DNA methylation stability in human tissue and assess the underlying molecular mechanisms. Using the colon and its cancers as a model, we examined the colorectal mucosa of healthy individuals for the presence of cancer-prone methylation changes. We found that aberrant gene promoter methylation arises in an age-, locus- and gender-speci c man-ner. The drift in gene promoter DNA methylation occurs with variable rates across the genome and concerns a variety of genes controlling key pathways Molecular Genetics Prof. Dr. Primo Sch\u00e4r Department of Biomedicine Biochemistry and GeneticsUniversity of Basel Weis (PhD student)Annika Wirz (PhD student) * left during report period of carcinogenesis. Notably, we could show that lifestyle factors modulate the rate of DNA methylation drift at cancer-relevant genes; e.g. Aspirin use suppressed, while a high BMI increased promoter hypermylation, the same way as they modulate colorectal cancer risk.

However, emerging evidence suggests that tolerance to TAA, limiting the extent of speci c immune responsiveness and tumor microenvironmental conditions intrinsic to cancer tissues might undermine, at least in part, the clinical effectiveness of the induction of tumor speci c immune responses. Based on this background our research group addresses translational on-cology projects aimed at the development of innovative clinically relevant cancer immunotherapy protocols and at the characterization of intratumoral environment in a variety of cancers.During the past fteen years we have developed an active, antigen speci c treatment platform based on the use of recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) of own design CD80 and CD86 co-stimulatory molecules has been used in the treatment of stage III/IV melanoma in phase I/II clinical trials showing safety and promising clinical results. To decrease the intrinsic vector immunogenici-ty, possibly hindering the induction of transgene speci c immune responses, we have now constructed a rVV encoding the Herpes simplex virus derived ICP47 protein, which blocks TAP mediated antigen processing while leaving unaltered the presentation of antigenic peptides directly delivered within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A rVV encoding ICP47 and ER targeted TAA epitopes proved to be superior in the induction of tumor speci c immune responses in cells from donors with high vaccinia speci c immune respon-siveness. On the other hand, considering that CD40 triggering by helper T cells promotes the presentation of MHC class I restricted epitopes by activat-ing a variety of antigen presenting cells (APC), we have constructed a series of rVV encoding CD40 ligand (CD154). Our previous studies underline that cancer/testis TAA are expressed in high ( >30%) percentages of cases in tu- mors of high epidemiological relevance, including lung, skin cancers, and urothelial malignancies. Therefore, we have constructed a rVV encoding a multiplicity of HLA-class I restricted together with CD80 and CD154. \"In vitro\" data are consistent with a high capacity of this reagent to induce speci c immune responsiveness. Our studies on the prognostic relevance of speci c tumor microenvironment features are conducted in collaboration with the Institute of Pathology of the University of Basel and focus, in particular, on colorectal cancer (CRC) and prostate cancer (PCA). Regarding CRC we could show that, similarly to a majority of solid malignancies, natural killer (NK) cell in ltration of CRC is poor and devoid of prognostic CRC in ltration by CD16 +/CD11b + myeloid cells appears to be surprisingly associated with good prognosis. Since CRC in ltration by myeloperoxidase producing cells is also associated with improved overall survival, these data may suggest that cells of the granulocytic lineage might possess antitumor functions in CRC.On the other hand, PD-1/PD-L1 interaction is currently being targeted by therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to prevent T cell \"exhaustion\". However, we could show that while CD8 + T cells in ltrating CRC are by and large PD- 1-, expression of PD-L1 by tumor cells is paradoxically associated with good prognosis.

Taken together these data underline the speci cities inherent in anti-cancer immune responsiveness in different cancer types and anatomical districts and suggest that therapeutic interventions should be tailored ac-cordingly.Prof. D. Oertli, Prof. A. BachmannProf. D. Surgery, University Hospital Basel, Kantonsspital Olten, Institute of Pathology, University of Basel Translational science in surgical oncology The \"Oncology\" lab of the Institute for Surgical Research and Hospital Management within the Department of Biomedi-cine, is closely connected with the surgical clinics of the Uni-versity Hospital. Young doctors perform their MD disserta-tions in our lab and surgeons at different levels of their ed-ucation and clinical careers spend periods ranging between six months and two years in the lab. This close interaction has enormously facilitated the access to clinical specimens and information, the development of translational projects and the planning of clinical trials.Within this frame, a critical role is also played by the interac-tion with the Institute of Pathology, maximizing clinical infor-mation and providing the indispensable view \"from the tumor side\" required for a realistic approach to cancer immunother-apy. In particular the tumor microarray technology developed within this Institute allows a rapid evaluation in a multitude of clinical specimens of working hypotheses emerging from basic immunology and cancer research. 118/119 Angiogenesis CancerEMTLymphangiogenesisMetastasisSignal TransductionMolecular dissection of tumor angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, and metastasis The vast majority of cancer deaths are due to metastasis. One major objec- tive of our research is the identi cation and characterization of the molecular pathways underlying malignant tumor progression and metastasis forma-tion; these pathways may be potential targets for innovative cancer thera-pies. In particular, we focus on the contribution of tumor angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis to tumor progression and on the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from benign neoplasia to malignant cancers and the metastatic dissemination of tumor cells. In addition to tumor cell lines in vitro, we employ transgenic mouse models of tumorigenesis to determine causal connections between the expression of particular genes and tumor progres-sion and metastasis in vivo. The development of malignant tumors is in part characterized by a tumor cell's capability to overcome cell-cell adhesion and to invade surrounding tissue by a process referred to as epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT). EMT underlies the conversion of epithelial, differentiated cells to mesen-chymal, migratory and invasive cells. In the past years, we have learned that EMT occurs in multiple stages and is regulated by sophisticated mo-lecular networks regulating the expression of a large number of protein- and miRNA-encoding genes. Notably, we have identi ed several transcription factors that act as master regulators not only in the initiation and execution of the morphogenic process of EMT but also in providing survival signals to cancer cells and thus allowing cancer cells to seed and grow metastases in distant organs. We investigate the direct target genes of these transcription factors and their functional contribution to tumor metastasis. These tran-scription factors bear many hallmarks of stem cell functions and may also de ne \"cancer-initiating cells\" which are able to seed metastasis. Transcrip-tional control is also studied in the context of the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, such as histone modi cations and DNA methylation, and their role in maintaining a cancer cell's plasticity to undergo EMT and to re-vert back to a differentiated cell (MET). Finally, we assess the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs and their target genes in the regulation of EMT and metastatic dissemination. With these experimental approaches we aim at the identi ca-tion of the master regulators of EMT and metastasis and we plan to scrutinize their potential as therapeutic targets for preventing metastatic disease.In a second line of research, we investigate the molecular pathways underly-ing the development of evasive resistance to targeted cancer therapy. We employ a number of mouse models to study the pathological, physiological and molecular consequences of therapies targeting tumor angiogenesis and malignant tumor progression. In particular, we use cell biological, biochemi-cal and bioinformatical analysis to delineate the molecular pathways allowing cancer cells to escape from targeted therapy. Moreover, we employ various transgenic mouse models for the design and testing of innovative cancer therapies, either based on anti-angiogenic strategies or by directly target-ing cancer cells. For example, in collaboration with Prof. Christoph Rochlitz, Dr. Andreas Wicki, and Dr. Christoph Mamot, Clinical Oncology, University Hospital Basel, we have tested immunoliposomes that are designed to target the tumor vasculature. Finally, in collaboration with pharmaceutical compa-nies we are investigating the ef cacy and biological consequences of various anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic cancer treatments.

In the past years, therapeutic approaches against the vascular en-dothelial growth factors (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2 signaling axis have been designed and are now in routine clinical use. However, an ef cient and longstanding targeting of tumor-associated endothelial cells has not been achieved. In collab-oration with Prof. Christoph Rochlitz, Dr. Andreas Wicki, transgenic and transplantation mouse models of cancer. Anti-VEGFR2-targeted immunoliposomes loaded with doxorubicin (anti-VEGFR2-ILs-dox) have proven supe-rior in therapeutic ef cacy to several other anti-angiogenic approaches and, hence, may provide a novel and promising anti-cancer strategy for patient treatment. The development of resistance to targeted cancer therapy (evasive resistance) has appeared a major obstacle in patient care. In collaboration with Prof. Alfred Zippelius and Prof. Markus Heim, we have begun to establish patient-derived xe-notransplanted (PDX) mouse models of head and neck squa-mous carcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma that recapitu-late evasive resistance by employing serial biopsies from pa-tients undergoing targeted therapy. We aim at the establish-ment of mouse models that recapitulate the development of evasive resistance to targeted therapies and that can be used for molecular, biochemical and genomic analysis of the pro-cesses underlying evasive resistance and to test rst alterna-tive therapies to overcome evasive resistance.

Immunology is dedicated to under- standing the various facets of interactions between host and environment, whether they are hostile or not. Equally important, immunologists aim at de ning the mechanisms that maintain internal homeostasis in the body. Refl ecting the broad spectrum of the eld, our Focal Area (FA) Immunology brings together a great variety of research groups with projects touching upon many of these fundamental aspects. The FA Immunology of the Department of Biomedicine (DBM) currently comprises 21 research groups and offers a dynamic platform for exchange among them. This is best exempli ed by the weekly immunology seminars and fruitful collaborations among the research groups. Whereas some groups concentrate their effort on developmental aspects of the immune system, others are dedicated to the study of how immune responses are regulated. The impact of the groups' research goes beyond the speci c eld of immunology and is addressing basic principles in biology and medi- cine likewise. Hence, the research topics in this FA range from clinical and experimental immunology, through diabetes research and hepatology, to transplantation nephrology and virology. A major goal of the FA Immunology is to understand the immunological as- pects of diabetes, nephropathy and islet infl ammation in type 2 diabetes. Additional clinical and translational questions drive research groups that study the immune response against fungal and other infections. Other groups investigate how primary immuno- de ciency and autoimmunity are interlinked; the role of natural killer cells in controlling infection and disease relapse in transplant recipients, and how autoantibodies targeting the complement factor C1q impact the disease course of systemic lupus patients. Other important questions tackled in the FA Immunology relate to the study of interaction characteristics between immune system and chronic viral infection. This research is centered on ba- sic aspects de ning immune mechanisms conferring protection or trigger- ing autoimmunity, as well as clinical issues such as testing of viral tropism or virus evolution under antiviral therapy. This wide variety of basic and translational immunological research activi- ties within this FA is strongly linked to clinical medicine of the University Hospitals and other institutions in Basel and worldwide - making the FA Immunology a dynamic hot spot for biomedical research.

However, the causes and pathogenic mechanisms of SLE are still not fully understood. A major hypothesis of the pathogenesis of SLE as-sumes that the disease is driven by a defective clearance of dead and dying (apoptotic) cells. In the context of an altered clearance, these apoptotic cells could become antigenic and initiate an autoimmune response. The comple-ment system has been shown to play an important role in the clearance of apoptotic cells and the de ciency of one of the early components of the clas-sical pathway of complement is strongly associated with the development of SLE. However, most SLE patients have no primary complement de ciency. In contrast, hypocomplementemia in SLE patients is a secondary event and most often associated with antibodies against the rst component of the clas- sical pathway of complement (C1q). As we and others have shown, auto- antibodies against C1q (anti-C1q) strongly correlate with renal fl ares in SLE patients. Our studies suggest that the occurrence of anti-C1q in SLE patients is necessary but not suf cient for the development of severe lupus nephritis. It is possible that anti-C1q interfere with the normal function of the comple-ment system including the clearance of apoptotic cells. As we could show, anti-C1q speci cally target C1q when bound to the surface of early apoptotic cells. More recently, we could identify a major linear epitope on the C1q mol-ecule targeted by anti-C1q. A diagnostic ELISA using this peptide was shown to be more speci c and more sensitive than a conventional anti-C1q assay for the detection of active nephritis in SLE patients. However, the role of anti-C1q in other diseases is not yet established and the suspected pathogenic mechanism of anti-C1q remains to be elucidated. Furthermore, the impor-tance of regular anti-C1q measurements as a clinical follow-up marker in SLE patients is not yet established. Therefore, our group aims to further exam- ine the pathological role and the clinical relevance of anti-C1q antibodies in a double approach based on experimental studies of anti-C1q and clinical studies of patients with SLE. In the experimental studies we want to under-stand i) the consequences of the binding of anti-C1q for the complement system and for phagocytic cells, ii) the origin of anti-C1q that potentially are initiated by molecular mimicry, and iii) the binding of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) to C1q since anti-C1q were found to have a striking sequence homol-ogy with vWF .

MBL is strongly related to C1q and has been shown to play an important role in the defence against infectious agents. More recent studies suggest that MBL also binds to apoptot-ic cells and plays a pro-infl ammatory role in experimental set-tings of ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The high frequency of functional MBL de ciency in the general population (about 25%) predestinates MBL for clinical studies investigating its role in human diseases.124/125 Developmental and Molecular Immunology Prof. Dr. Antonius Rolink Department of Biomedicine Roche Professor of ImmunologyUniversity of Basel Group Members Prof. Jan Andersson Dr. Natko Wagner* (technicians) * left during report periodHematopoiesis Stem Cells T Cell DevelopmentB Cell Development and AutoimmunityMolecular mechanisms guiding hematopoietic cell development The role of FLT3L in hematopoietic development All cells of the blood are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (HSC's). However the molecular mechanisms that drive the differentiation of these into various hematopoietic cells is still poorly understood. Now we have analyzed the role of FLT3L in this process by transgenic over-expression. Our analyses revealed that, FLT3L transgenic mice displayed a dramatic ex-pansion of dendritic and myeloid cells, leading to splenomegaly and blood leukocytosis (Figure 1). Bone marrow myeloid and lymphoid progenitors were signi cantly increased in numbers but retained their developmental potential. Furthermore, transgenic mice developed anemia together with a reduction in platelet numbers. FLT3L was shown to rapidly reduce erythro-cyte numbers when injected into wild-type mice, indicating a direct negative role of the cytokine on erythropoiesis. We conclude that FLT3L acts on mul- tipotent progenitors in an instructive way, inducing their development into myeloid/lymphoid lineages while suppressing their megakaryocyte/erythro-cyte potential (Figure 2). (A manuscript describing this has been submitted) An epigenetic pro le of early T cell development Cellular differentiation of the T cell branch of the immune system begins with the hematopoietic stem cell, which undergoes a series of stages character-ized by progressive restriction in multipotency and acquisition of speci c lineage identity.At the molecular level, the restriction of cell potential, commitment and dif-ferentiation to a speci c lineage is achieved through the coordinated con-trol of gene expression and epigenetic mechanisms. Here we analyzed and compared the gene expression pro les and the genome wide histone modi- cation marks H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in 1) In vitro propagated hemato- poietic stem cells, 2) In vitro generated and propagated pro T dells derived from these HSC's, and 3) Double positive thymocytes derived from these pro T cells upon injection of Rag de cient mice. The combined analyses of the different datasets highlighted the importance of both transcriptional and epigenetic repression in shaping the early phases of T cell development. Autoimmunity and aging Some autoimmune features, like production of anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) or rheumatoid factor (RF) become abundant in elderly human beings. In most cases, these elderly remain healthy. In this report we have investi-gated, whether the same holds true for inbred strains of mice. We found, that almost all mice of the strain C57BL/6 (B6) spontaneously produce high titers of IgG ANA, when they reach the age of 20 months. At that time, large numbers of germinal centers are present in the spleen, IgG deposition can be seen in glomeruli of kidneys and lymphocyte in ltrates are found in the salivary glands. Despite all these signs of an autoimmune response, the mice remain healthy. In marked contrast to B6 mice, mice of the inbred strain DBA/2 do not pro-duce any IgG ANA 's at that age. However, the F1 hybrids of these two strains (BDF1), show an intermediate incidence and lower titers of IgG ANA pro-duction, pointing out the importance of the genetic background. The ANA production is CD4 T cell dependent, since B6 mice de cient for MHC class II do not produce IgG ANA 's upon ageing. Experiments with lethally irradiated mice clearly show, that it is the ageing hematopoietic environment and not the precursor cells, which determine IgG ANA production. Adult thymec-tomy of young B6 mice will rapidly create a situation where ANA production commences as a result of altered T cell homeostasis, mimicking the condi- Selected Publications - The key role of IL-7 in lymphopoiesis.

However, since these therapies destroy blood cell production these patients have to be subsequently trans-planted with HSC's. A drawback of such a therapy is that the reconstitution of adaptive immune system and especial-ly the T cell compartments is relatively slow and thus the pa-tients go through a rather long phase in which they are im-munode cient.We have now developed a stromal cell free culture system that very ef ciently allows the differentiation of mouse HSC's into pro-T cells. This culture system consists of plate bound Notch ligand Delta like 4, IL-7 and SCF . Thus HSC's cultured under these conditions differentiate into cells that are equiv-alent to double negative 2 ( DN2) cells found in the thymus and these then can be propagated (doubling times 24 - 30 hrs) in vitro for at least up to 6 months. Transplantation of these into T cell de cient mice like Rag2-/- or CD3 -/- re- vealed that these cells can ef ciently give rise to one wave of T cell development. The mature T cells that exit the thy-mus are functional since transplanted CD3 -/- can mount a T cell dependent humoral immune response. Moreover, upon transplantation into T lymphopenic like pre-T de cient mice these pro-T cells are ef ciently able to improve the periph-eral T cell compartment. Based on our mouse ndings it is likely to assume that hu-man pro-T cells generated a similar way upon co-transplan-tation with HSC's will accelerate T cell development in these patients.tions observed in old mice. Thus, our ndings indicate that disturbed T cell homeostasis can drive the onset of some autoimmune features. Moreover, we generated over 170 IgG ANA producing hybridomas from individual old B6 and Balb/c mice. Around half of these IgG ANA 's were of the IgG2A and the other half were of the IgG2B isotype. No ANA of the IgG1 isotype was found indicating that TH1 cells drive this autoantibody formation. Currently we are trying to identify the antigen(s) that trigger this autoantibody formation.

They appear to originate from a common Id2-dependent progenitor cell. In analogy with Th1, Th2 and Th17 T cells, ILCs can be divided into 3 major groups: 1) IFN - producing ILC1, 2) IL-4, ILC2, and 3) IL-22 and -17-pro-ducing ILC3; the latter depend on the nuclear orphan receptor ROR t. Our previous research has shed light on how a ROR t+ILC3 subset, named lym- phoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells, regulates the generation of secondary lym-phoid organs. Type 2 and 3 ILCs have recently become the focus of attention for their potential roles in early responses to infection, infl ammation, and tis-sue repair (Figure 1). The identi cation of molecular pathways that control ILC development and function is essential for a better understanding of how ILCs may contribute to protective or infl ammatory responses. Our research is focusing on 1) lineage commitment and 2) age and environment dependent regulation of ILC type 2 and 3 function in mouse and man. Signaling pathways controlling ILC developmentOur research group has a long-standing interest in investigating pathways that regulate ILC development. ILCs emerge from progenitor cells in both the foetal liver and bone marrow (BM). We have established an in vitro assay that allows the development of ILCs from either foetal liver-derived 47+ precursor cells, or from BM derived hematopoietic stem cells expressing retroviral Nup98HoxB4 fusion protein. Using genetically modi ed mouse models (loss or gain of function, reporter gene) and retroviral gene delivery models, we have gained further insights into the cytokine-driven regulation of ILCs. We have reported three critical pathways involved in the life cycle and differentiation of ILC3s and in their function to control lymphoid tissue generation (Figure 2). One is mediated by the cytokine receptor IL-7R that binds to IL-7, a survival factor for lymphocytes. The other is triggered by the engagement of TSLPR, a cytokine receptor involved in allergic infl ammation and T cell differentiation. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands control postnatal c-kit expression, the third cytokine receptor involved in the expan-sion of ILC3s. Importantly, we could show that IL-7R and c-kit collaborate in establishing the pool of ILCs and in the generation of lymph nodes. Now, we have found that both IL-2 and Flt3L differentially regulate the number of foetal and adult ILCs. ILCs in innate and adaptive immunityILC3s are important for the maintenance of mucosal barrier function and anti-microbial immunity. We found that upon IL-1 stimulation, ILC3s up-regulate MHC class II IFN , IL-2, GMCSF) and in analogy with dendritic cells, gain the ability to present antigen to CD4 + T cells. This cognate interaction induces T-cell activation and proliferation in vitro while its disruption impairs T cell- mediated responses in vivo. In addition, we found that ILC3s can directly respond to particular Toll-like receptor ligands. Taken together, our data show that under infl ammatory conditions, ILC3s can trigger T cell responses, ascribing to them a novel function, namely connecting innate and adaptive immunity.

Epub 2013 Aug 20.ILCs and tissue repair ILC3s are the main producers of IL-22, a cytokine known to be involved in protection against bacteria, as well as the regeneration of epithelial and liver cells. ILC3s can help to restore and maintain the architecture of lymphoid tissues after virus-induced injury, suggesting a key function of this subset in tissue repair. We have now developed new mouse models to study the role for ILCs in improving immune competence following ir-radiation, BM transplantation, and recovery from colitis. In mice with a selective increase in ILC numbers but lack of T, B and NK cells, we are analysing the impact of ILC3s on recovery from infl ammatory intestinal damage, and in generating and stabilizing lymphoid niches under im-mune-compromised conditions. Fig. 1 Fig. 2Connection to Clinical Practice PD Dr. Sven Wellmann Dr. Nicole Ritz University Children's Hospital Basel Diagnostics of cytokine levels and ILC function in preterm infants Several clinic-pathological conditions in children are associ- ated with the development of lymphopenia, including BM transplantation, cancer, severe infections and autoimmune diseases. In addition, preterm neonates often show marked lymphopenia and diminished plasma levels of IL-7. A lead-ing cause of death in these children is mucosal infections and pulmonary immaturity. The maturation of the preterm lung requires a balance between bene cial tissue remodelling responses that drive proliferation while also acting to limit these responses in order to prevent brosis. There is strong evidence that ILCs have a role in mucosal immunity and pul-monary tissue homeostasis in man. For example, transcrip-tional pro ling of lung ILCs identi ed a strong enrichment for genes that regulate immune defence and wound-heal-ing. This suggests that ILC subsets have tissue-protecting functions. To better understand how lymphopenia and pre-mature birth may alter protective ILC functions, the number, ratio and cytokine pro le of ILCs in the peripheral blood of normal and preterm neonates needs to be explored. The abil-ity to speci cally target ILC functions could be bene cial in promoting mucosa and lung integrity. Our collaborator in the division of neonatology and infectiology/vaccinology have a strong background in lung physiology, mucosal infections and stress responses of preterm infants. 128/129 Diabetes Research Prof. Dr. Marc Y .

In previous studies we demonstrated that the metabolic stress evoked by high glucose and saturated fatty acids (contained in animal fat) may in-duce death of the insulin producing beta-cells of the islets. Subsequently we identi ed interleukin 1 beta as a key mediator of these deleterious effects and showed that it is produce by human beta-cells in type 2 diabetes. More recently we published several additional studies supporting the concept that this mechanism leads to an infl ammatory process and underlies the failure toproduce suf cient amount of insulin in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of this we initiated clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes that vindicates this hypothesis and opens the way for a causative treatment. Furthermore we identi ed a new endocrine loop by showing that elevated IL-6 mediates a cross talk between insulin sensitive tissues, L cells and pancreatic islets to adapt to changes in insulin. Finally, recently we uncovered the rst mono- genic form of type 1 diabetes. This research has contributed to the concept that the innate immune system is part of the regulation of metabolism. The overall goal of the present projects aim at understanding the precise role and regulation of the uncovered islet infl ammation in type 2 diabetes and test therapeutic interventions.

T cells recognize as antigens peptides, lipids, and phosphorylated non-peptidic metabolites. Our research focus is the study of the human T cell populations that recognize lipid antigens presented by CD1 molecules, those that recognize small metabolites presented by MR1 molecules and those that recognize phosphorylated metabolites. One area of investigation is the identi cation of lipid antigens relevant for human diseases. Lipid-speci c T cells kill mycobacteria-infected cells and intracellular mycobacteria, thus exerting protective function. Therefore, the identi cation of mycobacterial lipid antigens is instrumental to further our knowledge and to identify novel targets of immunotherapy. Three Mycobacterium tuberculosis lipids were identi ed with potential rel- evance during mycobacterial infections. We identi ed a new mycobacterial lipid, a di-acylated sulfotrehalose, which induces a strong speci c immune response in tuberculosis patients. This lipid is generated by virulent myco-bacteria and detection of speci c immune response is a novel tool to detect the presence of mycobacterial latent infection. Analogs of this lipid are being evaluated as subunit vaccine in human CD1b transgenic animals generated in our laboratory. The second lipid antigen is hexamannosylated phosphatidyl-myo-inositol (PIM6). We found that CD1e is required for PIM6 processing, thus attribut-ing the rst known function to this CD1 molecule. CD1e binds this glycolipid antigen and offers it to hydrolases and lipases for proper processing of the carbohydrate and lipid moieties. In addition, CD1e participates in loading other CD1 molecules with processed lipid antigens. The third lipid antigen is glycerol-monomycolate. This lipid has also adjuvant properties and therefore it represents a unique molecule, which combines the two important functions of antigen and adjuvant. Combination of glycer-ol-monomycolate with other immunogenic lipids facilitates the induction of speci c response in CD1b transgenic mice and thus this lipid may be consid-ered an ideal subunit of lipid-based anti-mycobacterial vaccines. We identi ed the nature of self-lipids that induce selection in thymus of in- variant natural killer T cells and their expansion in the peripheral lymphoid organs. These lipids are generated within peroxisomes and belong to the family of lysoplasmalogens. Animals de cient in the enzymes responsible for the peroxisomal synthesis of plasmalogens showed profound defects in iNKT cell development and peripheral expansion. A second major topic of investigation is the population of T cells restricted to MR1 molecules. We have found an extreme oligoclonality in the circulating MAIT cells, which are MR1 restricted. Less than 5% of unique TCR V se- quences may account for up to 90% of the total repertoire. In addition, public sequences are very frequently shared among different individuals, thus indi-cating a selection bias introduced by antigenic stimulation. The comparison of MAIT cells in infl ammatory disease patients showed high prevalence of activated cells within gut lesions but not in normal gut tissue. The third main interest is the mechanism of antigen recognition by human TCR cells. We have identi ed Butyrophilin 3A1 (BTN 3A1) as the pre- senting molecule to T cells expressing the TCR V 9-V2. BTN 3A1 binds phosphorylated metabolites, which are the antigens stimulating V 9-V2 cells, in a shallow pocket.

Antigen binding to BTN 3A1 was detected with a 1:1 stoichiometry with interacting with endogenous ones. Importantly, BTN 3A1 is expressed and ef ciently presents endogenous phosphorylated metabolites that accumulate within tumor cells and stimulate V 9-V2 cells. Thus, BTN 3A1 represents an ideal can- didate molecule to manipulate the immune response during infections and to promote tumor immunosurveillance.

In broad terms we investigate the following aspects thereof: - Immune protection against persistent viral infection- Virally vectored vaccines- Viral triggers of autoimmune disease- Mechanisms of viral pathogenesis- Role of alarmins in antiviral immunity In the context of the above areas we are equally interested in both arms of adaptive immunity, i.e. T cell and B cell / antibody responses. We combine molecular virological techniques (\"reverse genetics\") for the engineering of infectious viruses with state-of-the-art mouse infection models and cellular immunology. Although fundamental by character, the questions addressed have immediate links to major unmet global health needs. In the mid- to long-term, this offers considerable translational potential, notably for vaccination and treatment of persistent viral diseases like human immunode ciency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C virus, as well as for select autoimmune disorders.

Bantug (postdoctoral fellow) Dr. Christoph T. Berger Dr. Matthias Dr. Mike Recher lymphocyte functioning Metabolic pathway usage dictates cellular responsiveness. Our general in- terest is to assess how the metabolic repertoire of various human lympho-cyte subsets de nes their functionality. Over the last few years our speci c focus was on characterizing metabolic pathways and their regulation among resting and immediate-early activated na\u00efve and antigen-experienced human CD8 T cell subsets.During acute viral infection, pathogen-speci c na\u00efve CD8 T cells become activated -followed by clonal expansion and differentiation into cytotoxic ef-fector cells (1). Resolution of infection triggers the contraction of effector cell population, which is accompanied by the formation of a long-lived memory pool (2). In a highly coordinated process, memory CD8 T cells subsequently enhance host protection upon secondary infection (recall response) (2).Na\u00efve and memory CD8 T cells are metabolically quiescent cells, which primarily depend on oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) as their energy source (3). T cell receptor (TCR)-ligation and co-stimulation of quiescent cells initiates dramatic changes in cellular metabolic pathway usage (4). Upregulation of aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) is an important feature of this metabolic adaptation, and a prerequisite for growth and expansion of CD8 T cells (4). The early recall phase of an immune response relies on antigen-experienced T cells that are able to acquire effector function with 'innate-like' response kinetics (5). Effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells are specialized antigen-experienced lymphocytes that traf c between blood and non-lymphoid tissues (5). EM CD8 T cells are thus ideally positioned to rapidly respond and execute effector functions at sites of infection.The metabolic requirements that support the pivotal immediate-early memo-ry functionality were at the center of our recent interest. A de ning metabolic feature of EM CD8 T cells was their selective capacity to rapidly upregulate and sustain aerobic glycolysis following mitochondrial acidi cation rate (ECAR). EM CD8 T cells migrate to, and reside in different environmental niches (5). A high glycolytic capacity likely affords increased adaptability to changes in nutrient availability and/or stimulatory conditions. Glycolysis was also increased in memory CD8 T cells following TCR/CD28 stimulation (Fig. 1). In a PI3K-AKT pathway dependent man-ner, the immediate-early glycolytic phase was critical for rapid IFN-gamma production by memory CD8 T cells, including EBV-speci c memory cells. Pharmacologic blockade of glycolysis during the early phase of CD8 T cell activation resulted in the diminution of IFN-gamma production, potentially via abrogation of chromatin remodeling (data not shown). Our observations indicate that memory CD8 T cells rely on CD28 signaling to sustain immedi-ate early metabolic switch, and that CD28 co-stimulation is also important for enhanced IFN-gamma production. AKT phosphorylation by up-stream kinases and mTORC2 metabolic switch and for GAPDH cytoplasmic expression (data not shown). Together, our ndings identify a previously unrecognized phase of the War- burg effect and assign it a role beyond supporting effector T cell proliferation, namely in regulating the immediate-early effector response of memory CD8 T cells.

Acting as a S1P the treat-ment of multiple sclerosis (MS)- blocks the egress of T cell from lymphnodes.By studying depletion kinetics of T cells in the blood of de novo ngolimod exposed individuals, we found that CD4 T cells diminish earlier than CD8 T cells. This suggests that -under steady state conditions- CD4 T cells enter lymphoid tissue, and thus access dendritic cells, more frequently than CD8 T cells. Differences in calculated homing frequencies between na\u00efve and antigen-experienced T cell subsets were even more pronounced, na\u00efve T cells homing 2-3x as often to lymphnodes as central memory cells. We further character-ized immune responses to infl uenza-vaccine in ngolimod-treated patients and in untreated healthy controls. Counter-intuitively, vaccine-triggered T cells -in contrast to steady-state homing accumulate normally in blood despite ef cient S1PR-blockade.Together these studies provide insight into important as-pects of human T cell biology, namely their recirculation properties under homeostatic conditions and effector and memory CD8 T cell differentiation during viral infection.

To date, more than 180 different PID have been characterized. De ciency of the recombination activating genes (RAG) is associated with PID affecting number and function of both T and B lymphocytes. RAG-PID associated clinical phenotypes range from lead to RAG- dependent SCID, so-called hypomorphic RAG mutations are associated with the late-onset RAG-associated diseases. The mechanisms involved in autoimmunity and immune-dysregulation due to hypomorphic RAG-mutations are poorly de ned. Autoimmunity and im- mune-dysregulation are also associated with RAG-independent PID, imply- ing that PID and autoimmunity are fundamentally linked. One main focus of the lab is to analyze in murine models how gradual RAG dysfunction impacts on immunity to infectious pathogens and at the same time to the formation of autoimmunity. This may help identifying mecha- nisms involved in the generation of autoimmunity in general. - Notarangelo, L.D. (2010). T., Perez-Becker, R., and Schuetz, C. (2010).

The focus of our research is to understand what immunolog-ic mechanisms are involved in PID associated autoimmunity.Autoimmunity - No immnode ciencyAutoimmunity - Immnode Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrg A. Schifferli Department of Biomedicine and Division of Internal MedicineUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Dr. Arun and ectosomes Our immune system needs to assimilate (satisfy) two seemingly opposing requirements. While on one hand its expected to raise an effective response against infection, on the other hand it should not achieve this at our expense. The stronger the mechanisms in place designed to protect us, the more strictly it should be regulated to remain purposeful. An immune response is therefore a balancing act between pro- and anti- infl ammatory mechanisms that ultimately lead to a measured and meaningful response.Our present investigations are based on our recent observations that differ-ent circulating cells (erythrocytes, leukocytes, platelets) release small vesi-cles by budding from the cell surface. This budding corresponds to a reac-tion described 20 years ago as \"ectocytosis\", thus we named these vesicles \"ectosomes\". Structurally, these ectosomes express surface proteins in a dif-ferent ratio than found on the originating cell suggesting a speci c selection process at the time of budding. In addition, phosphatidylserine (PS) is pres-ent on the outer leafl et of the ectosome membrane as found for apoptotic cells. PS serves as receptor for many proteins including C1q, Gas6 and oth- ers, which might bridge ectosomes to phagocytes. We have now established that these vesicles have biological functions. Our initial data indicated that ectosomes of PMN, erythrocytes and platelets down-modulate the infl am-matory reaction of macrophages and dendritic cells. However, when present in the circulation, PS present on these ectosomes does activate the coagula-tion cascade.Our present goals are to de ne the properties of ectosomes, in particular their capacity to interfere with the function of cells involved in infl ammation and immunity, as well as their procoagulant activity in vivo. 1) Ectosomes of platelets express TGFbeta, and may regulate T cell differ- entiation and the function of NK cells. These functions of ectosomes are explored by Salima Sadallah in collaboration with the group of Prof G Iez- zi (DBM) and Prof M Stern (DBM) respectively. Initial data indicate that platelet ectosomes shift the differentiation of na\u00efve CD4 + T cells towards functional T regulatory cells ( g. 1). 2) The release of ectosomes is an early phenomenon of neutrophil activa- tion. These ectosomes have anti-infl ammatory properties and constitute an early counter-regulatory signal that helps initiate the resolution of in-fl ammation, as shown in vitro using uric acid crystals as a model for gout ( g. 2). Arun Cumpelik is currently investigating how these ectosomes affect the course of infl ammation in a mouse model of uric acid crystal-induced peritonitis and may be responsible for its self-limiting nature. In addition, he is investigating whether ectosomes aid in maintaining toler-ance against neutrophilic self-antigens (myeloperoxidase) in an immuni-zation model of pANCA vasculitis. 3) The role of ectosomes produced or released directly in the blood stream is studied by Daniel Zecher with the help of Arun Cumpelik. He is in- vestigating microvesicle biology in different scenarios: First, their role in transfusion-related complications in mice. He has found in a murine transfusion model that microvesicles derived from aged erythrocytes (E-Ecto) amplify systemic infl ammation by thrombin-dependent activation of complement independent of the classical, alternative or lectin pathway ( g. 3). Second, he is studying the release of microvesicles in patients fol-lowing treatment with depleting antibody preparations in the context of solid organ and stem cell transplantation. The aim is to correlate microves-icle release with treatment ef cacy and side effects, most notably hyper-coagulability. In another study he is looking at the release of microvesicles Selected Publications - Eken et al., 2008, C. Eken, O. Gasser, G. Oehri, C.

In this setting, the shedding of graft endothelial-derived microvesicles might be involved in protecting the graft from antibody-mediated in-jury, i.e. transplant rejection. 140/141 Immuno- regulation Prof. Dr. Simona Rossi Girard SNSF Professor Department of BiomedicineImmunology University Hospital Basel Group Members Dr. Maria Broggi* (postdoctoral fellow) Nad\u00e8ge Lagarde fellow) cellsLymph Node Stroma CellsImmunoprivileged SiteRegulatory T cells and lymph node stroma cells responses during allograft transplantation The success of solid organ transplantation is determined by the ability to con- trol rejection and establish tolerance. Currently this problem is overcome by treating the patients with immunosuppressive agents, which cause a large number of side effects that compromise the graft survival and patients' life quality. For this reasons tolerance rather than drug-mediated suppression is the ultimate goal in transplantation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a cellular component of the adaptive immune system with the ability to control the ac-tivity of graft rejecting effector T cells. Transfer of Tregs was shown to induce tolerance in various murine organ transplantation models. The establishment of tolerance is not an indicator for long term graft acceptance, since Treg-me-diated tolerance can be broken. One of the major breaking tolerance causes are strong infl ammatory responses. In our rst project, we aim to examine how Tregs collaborate with the lymph node (Ln) environment to establish and maintain long-term graft tolerance. Therefore, we transplant allogeneic skin grafts on recipient mice and transfer different ratio's of effector CD4 T cells and Tregs. Anti-graft speci c effector T cells (ABMs) reject the graft within 12 days (Fig. 1). The co-transfer of poly-clonal Tregs delays rejection (2:1) or induces long-term allograft acceptance (10:1). The graft tolerance is sustained despite challenging with high ABM numbers. ABMs do proliferate in all groups, but show impaired proliferation in the presence of Tregs. ABMs are activated as determined by expression of surface markers and display a memory-like phenotype which is independent of Tregs. However, IFN-g-producing effector T cells are less abundant in the presence of Tregs. IFN-g might activate and modulate Ln stromal cells (LnSC) during transplantation tolerance, which in turn support Tregs to maintain long-term tolerance. Indeed, strong IFNg-dependent infl ammation reduced the expression of the T cell survival factor IL-7. In contrast, Tregs maintained IL-7 production by LnSC (Fig. 2). IL-7 was mainly used by Tregs and naive ABMs suggesting an additional survival advantage of those after transplanta-tion. High amounts of IL-7 did not lead to survival of all transferred Tregs, but enough to establish a ratio of Tregs to ABMs in the LN. One Treg cell is needed to suppress one ABM cell to achieve long-term tolerance against skin graft rejection. Taken together LnSC respond to Tregs and support their suppression of infl ammatory CD4 + T cell responses in the Ln. Our second project is based on the fact that infl ammatory responses infl u- ence recruitment and activation of adaptive immune cells in Ln and may even break established graft tolerance. Excessive infl ammation mainly occur dur-ing infections and autoimmune diseases and often leads to cell death and release of CpG containing motifs of DNA. Thus, we take advantage of the possibility to growth in vitro LnSC (Fig. 3) and study the responses of LnSC upon stimulation with CpG-dependent dendritic cell cytokines. CpG stimu- cytokines. containing IFN-b induce upregulation of antigen presenting and costimulatory molecules suggesting an active contribution of LnSC in activation of T lymphocytes, which is currently focus of our studies. Taken together LnSC respond to infl ammatory cytokines and their producing cells to modify their biological activity to sustain the activation and contrac-tion of T lymphocytes. Understanding the function and responses of LnSC will provide new aspects in the regulation of immune responses by affecting activation and survival of speci c T cells.

While much progress has been made over the last 10 years in the characterization of NK cell surface receptors and their ligands, the function and ligands of several NK cell receptors are still unknown.NK cells are of particular importance in patients under pharmacological im-munosuppression, e.g. after solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation. These patients with compromised adaptive immunity are there-fore predestined to study the role of natural killer cells in the control of malignant and viral transformation. Our studies focus on one family of NK cell receptors termed Killer-cell Immu- noglobulin-like receptors (KIR). KIR are transmembrane proteins and come in an inhibitory or activating fl avor. While the function of inhibitory KIR is clear (providing NK cell tolerance through binding to HLA-class I) both func-tion and ligands of activating KIR are so far unde ned. Studies in transplant-ed patients have hinted that patients carrying activating KIR have a reduced rate of viral infection, pointing to viral proteins as potential activating KIR li-gands. Through studies involving solid organ grafts performed in transplant centers in Switzerland reporting to the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study, we have identi ed activating KIR receptors as having a protective role regarding the occurrence of cytomegalovirus replication after transplantation. These studies are accompanied by in vitro experiments aiming to resolve receptor-ligand interactions relevant for this protective role of NK cells. Another line of research is directed towards the identi cation of activating KIR receptors involved in the recognition of acute myeloid leukemia cells, where clinical studies have also documented a bene t for patients receiving allografts from a donor carrying such activating receptor genes. A more recently established line of research analyzes how KIR are involved in the antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), an important mode of action of therapeutically administered monoclonal antibodies. We could show that the superior ef cacy of modern third-generation glycoengineered antibodies is partly due to their ability to overcome inhibitory signaling by KIR receptors. Finally, in a translational arm of our research and in close collaboration with the Division of Hematology at the University Hospital, we are treating pa-tients with cancers incurable by conventional chemotherapy with highly puri ed and ex vivo expanded NK cells with the aim to eradicate disease through a combined chemo-/immunotherapy approach.

One of our main interests is the interaction of innate and adaptive immune response in the context of fungal infections with the goal to generate new immunothera-peutic strategies. A second focus is based on novel anti-infective approaches against foreign-body/implant-associated infections caused by staphylococci. Host pathogen interaction in fungal infections Invasive fungal infections belong to the most serious complications in immu-nocompromised patients and are still associated with an exuberant mortality. Little is known regarding the protective immune response against fungi in humans. In mice, distinct fungi-speci c CD4 + T-helper (TH) subsets such as TH1, and probably TH17 cells are important for pathogen control, whereas activation of TH2 cells often exacerbates disease. The T-cell response provides important effector and survival signals towards key players of the innate immu-nity such as neutrophils or macrophages via secretion of different cytokines. Therefore, understanding this cross-talk in the context of antifungal immunity is important for the development of immunotherapeutic strategies (Figure 1). We are currently investigating in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell trans-plantation (HSCT) and in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy the qualitative impairments and the kinetics of recovery of antifungal immunity. Adoptive T-cell therapy for viral and fungal infections Adoptive T-cell therapy is promising and recommended in patients after HSCT with treatment refractory viral infections caused by adenovirus, cyto-megalovirus and Epstein Barr virus. Although fungal infections occur at the same time, there is insuf cient experience with adoptive therapy for Asper- gillus or other fungi mainly due to lack of target T-cell antigens. We have pre- viously identi ed a of the cell wall Crf1 stimulating cross-reactive T cells that recognize Aspergillus fumigatus as well as Candida albicans (Fig. 2A), which are the two most common fungi causing infections in patients after HSCT. Using a strategy based on activation-dependent ex-pression of CD154, we could simultaneously select and enrich T cells spe-ci c for viral and fungal pathogens (Fig. 2B). This approach is promising for future application to prevent post-transplant fungal and viral infections.To generate ef cacious and potent fungus-speci c T-cell therapy, T-cells must cover a wide range of different antigens. This is quite challenging as the fungal genome contains up to 10'000 protein-coding genes. We are currently investigating the T-cell responses speci c for several Aspergillus antigens in patients recovering from fungal infections. This nding will be of great importance to improve the generation of protective fungus-speci c T-cells for adoptive transfer. Staphylococcal implant infections Bacterial infection of implanted devices is a major health care problem occur-ring in about 5% of patients. These infections are mainly caused by bio lm-forming Staphylococcus (S.) aureus and S. epidermidis. Successful treat- ment requires drugs or coatings, which are active against adhering bacteria which are often less susceptible to antibiotics. We could demonstrate that Serrulatane EN4 that was isolated from an Eremophila plant species seems to be promising to treat these infections (Fig. 3). We are currently investigating different anti-infective coatings and new compounds for their anti-adhesive and anti-microbial activity within different collaborative networks.Connection to Clinical Practice Fungal and viral infections have become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. Phar-maceutical agents are often less effective in the setting of im-munode ciency, may cause substantial side effects, are ex-pensive and may generate resistance. To overcome these is-sues, understanding the host-pathogen interaction and ex-ploring strategies such as adoptive T-cell transfer that boost and induce long-term immunity may be promising in these patients.

Among CD4+ T cells, a subset termed regulatory T cells (Treg) is essential for the establishment and maintenance of immune homeostasis. Due to their proven ability to prevent and even cure autoimmune diseases and their im-portant role in preventing rejection of transplanted organs in preclinical ani-mal models, therapeutic adoptive Treg transfer is a new approach currently being explored in clinical trials to treat various immune related diseases. In contrast, CD4 + follicular helper T cells (T FH) provide classic \"help\" to B cells and promote autoimmunity. We have previously demonstrated that Treg can lose the hallmark transcription factor FoxP3 and turn into pathogenic cells. Interestingly, other researchers have demonstrated that Treg can, under certain conditions, convert to T FH. Thus, although functionally antagonistic, there is a close molecular interrelationship between Treg and T FH. On a molecular level, our work is focused on \"non-coding RNAs\", i.e. RNA molecules whose primary purpose is not to act as an intermediary between DNA and protein. Rather, many classes of non-coding RNAs seem to pri- marily regulate gene expression but our understanding of these functions is very limited. One of the best studied classes of non-coding RNAs are called microRNAs (miRNA) due to their short length. They act as posttranscriptional negative regulators of other genes. We have demonstrated the dependence of several T cell subsets on miRNAs. Current research projects investigate how individual microRNA loci control T cell differentiation and function. In mice, we have demonstrated that miRNAs are critical for Treg function and stability as miRNA-de cient Treg rapidly lose FoxP3. Furthermore, we found that one particular miRNA locus called miR-17-92 is important for Treg biol- ogy and function in vivo. In addition, using T cell-speci c genetic ablation of the same miRNA locus in vivo combined with immunization protocols and genome-wide transcript analysis we demonstrated that loss of miR-17-92 leads to impaired differentiation of T FH. Unexpectedly, miR-17-92-de cient cells retained a T FH-like phenotype but acquired features characteristic of other T cell subsets, i.e. cells were displaying a hybrid phenotype. Thus, miR-17-92 is required for the delity of T FH gene expression and as such T FH cell identity. In summary, miR-17-92 has pleiotropic effects on diverse T cell subsets for their function and cellular identity. Future directions include a more in-depth analysis of genetic networks regu- lated by miR-17-92 in Treg and T FH as well as the analysis of various addi- tional miRNA loci in T cell differentiation, identity and function. We expect that by studying miRNAs and their target genes we will signi cantly advance our understanding of immune regulation. Furthermore, we are interested in the interplay between miRNAs and other forms of posttranscriptional gene regulation. A better fundamental understanding of molecular control of T cell gene expression and lymphocyte function forms the basis for fu- ture therapies. The ultimate goal of our research efforts is to translate our basic research ndings to novel concepts and approaches that will bene t patients suffering from a variety of immune related diseases. To this end we are currently exploring approaches to modulate miRNA function as a novel therapeutic modality.

Our major research interest is to understand the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients. Urinary loss of proteins ( = proteinuria) is an early characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. Proteinuria re-sults from an increased passage of proteins through the glomerular ltration barrier as a consequence of raised transcapillary pressure as well as structural alterations. The glomerular ltration barrier consists of capillary endothelial cells, the glomerular basement membrane, and the so called podocytes (highly specialized epithelial cells). Importantly, morphological alterations of podocytes and nally podocyte loss resulting from apoptosis occur at the onset of diabetic nephropathy. We identi ed that podocytes are highly susceptible to the saturated free fatty acid (FFA) palmitic acid, which induces al., palmitic acid-induced podocyte death is linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress involving the proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) (Sieber et al., 2010). In contrast, we found that monounsaturated FFAs, such as et al., 2010). In glomeruli of type 2 diabetic patients with diabetic nephropathy we dis-covered that mRNA expression levels of several key enzymes involved in fatty acid metabolism are altered (Fig. 1, Sieber et al., 2013). The most prominent change is the upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1, which results mainly from in SCDs desaturate or to protect podocytes from palmitic acid-induced cell death. Mechanistically, we oleic acid or pharmacological stimula-tion of SCDs promote the incorporation of saturated FFAs, e.g. palmitic acid, into triglycerides, suggesting that the protective effect at least in part results from compartmentalization of palmitic acid in \"safe lipid pools\" (Sieber et al., 2013). Importantly, our glomerular gene expression analysis in type 2 dia-betic patients also suggests disposition for increased fatty acid oxidation as all three isoforms downregulated (Sieber et al., 2013). We hypothesize that this disposition for increased fatty acid oxida-tion refl ects an adaptive, protective mechanism against toxic free fatty acids in diabetic nephropathy. This is supported by our nding that stimulation of fatty acid oxidation in podocytes protects from palmitic acid induced ER stress and cell death whereas inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is deleterious. In addition, we discovered that fatty acid oxidation is critically regulated by acetyl-CoA carboxylases (Kampe, manuscript submitted). This observation potentially explains the results of recent genome wide association studies which discovered that the risk for diabetic nephropathy in type 2 diabetic patients is related to a single nucleotide polymorphism in the ACC-2 gene which results in a higher expression of ACC-2 and likely leads to decreased fatty acid oxidation and accumulation of toxic FFAs.

Reliable tropism testing for the clinics - This major effort bases on the fact that HIV occurs as two distinct forms differing in their receptor depen-dence. The new HIV inhibitor class targets only CCR5-tropic viruses. This necessitates prior to therapy a tropism determination: Does the virus use CCR5 or the alternative CXCR4 chemokine receptor? We set out to establish a unique, reliable diagnostic test together with our spinoff InPheno AG. The tropism-determining sequence \"V3\" within the HIV envelope gene is rep-resented in a labeled probe, which is hybridized to a patient-derived blood sample. Our system reads CCR5-/CXCR4-tropism and identi es/dissects mixed virus populations, a main advantage over sequencing systems (Fig1). In 2011 our test passed a European ring trial for quality control; it became accredited and accepted by the Swiss BAG for reimbursement through the Analysenliste.2. Residual virus despite successful therapy? - In some patients a full suppression of HIV is not achieved although medication appears appropri-ate. In vitro observations suggest that viral expression from integrated ge-nomes could contribute to this worrisome residual viral RNA, which must not necessarily be a sign of treatment failure. Retroviruses such as HIV require as essential step the genomic integration into the host chromosome. The new integrase inhibitors block this key step possibly leading to the rst step to-wards HIV genome elimination and eradication. However, in a new project we have identi ed evidence that even unintegrated viral DNA can allow viral gene expression and potentially also the generation of infectious progeny. Our current investigations attempt to verify production of infectious particles despite the presence of therapeutic doses of integrase inhibitors. We will fur- ther try to isolate infectious virus from patients with persisting low viremia. This would have important implications for the clinics.3. Role of HIV Gag in therapy resistance - It is being recognized that even in times of a broad therapy coverage with the highly potent drug class of HIV protease inhibitors (PI) a fair number of patients fail virologically in the absence of signature mutations in the viral protease gene. For addressing this issue we initiated a collaborative project with the Swiss HIV Cohort Study, in which we systematically analyzed virus sequences near the 3' end of the gag gene, where key cleavage sites are encode. The anonymized HIV-1 da-tabases of 2000 sequences stems from a characterized therapy context or from untreated patients. Side-by-side analysis of these two groups enables us to identify alterations emerging only under drug pressure. Mutations can enhance \"minor protease mutations\" or are by themselves responsible for drug-resistance and clinical therapy failure. Our newly identi ed mutations associate with clinical PI resistance; they either correspond with earlier publi-cations thus validating our algorithm or they have not been described before as treatment-associated escape mutations (Fig2). Currently we are introduc-ing these mutations into lab strains of HIV-1 in order to phenotypically test if they convey PI resistances. We will further isolate infectious virus from patients with persisting low viremia. This could help understanding \"unex-plained virological therapy failures\" and would be an important addition to the current resistance algorithms.4. A somewhat \"exotic\" project aims at widening our views on drug dis- covery: In a collaboration with the South African CSIR we focus on respi-ratory infections caused by RSV and infl uenza. Together with InPheno we have now been able to validate a new phenotypic screening system for in- hibitors. Various indigenous plants, claimed to possess anecdotal activity, have been extracted and tested in a rst pilot study. First promising hits have been identi ed (Fig3) with selective antiviral activity in the absence of toxicity in cell models and await now further pro ling and puri cation. As long-term goal we aim at a pharmaceutical development. Selected Publications - Fehr, J., Glass, T.R., Louvel, S., al. (2011).

In particu-lar the development of tests for viral drug resistance and for identifying the viruses cell tropism are assisting clinicians for disease management. Emerging from this clinical utility we have focussed research onto newer underlying mechanisms of persisting low viral replication in long-term treated patients or on the predictive value of analyses of viral parameters in cells rather than cell-free blood plasma. Also pilot studies on longer term effects of integrated versus unintegrated viral ge-nomes in the patient may help to understand viral progres-sion or may be useful for concepts towards HIV elimination. Beyond HIV as human pathogen part of our research can directly be applied to other viruses with clinical importance. In fruitful international collaborations we have invested in the identi cation of new inhibitory concepts targeting vital virus functions. Herein we concentrate on respiratory pathogen-ic viruses such as Infl uenza, parainfl uenza, and RSV . With a group in Pretoria we recognize the intriguing source of nat-ural compounds in South African plants, known in traditional medicine to possess disease- ghting properties. Our plan is to identify therein the active principles and make them avail-able for pharmaceutical exploitation. 152/153 Paediatric Immunology Prof. Dr. Georg A. Holl\u00e4nder ImmunologyUniversity Children's Hospital Basel and Children's HospitalUniversity of Oxford, UK Group Members Peter Annick DevelopmentGenetics, EpigeneticsThe immunobiology of the thymus T cell mediated responses play a crucial role in providing protective immuni- ty, but at the same time are also responsible for a broad range of autoimmune pathologies when directed against an individual's own tissues. The linage commitment and maturation of T cells is instructed during their thymic de-velopment consequent to a close physical and functional interaction with the organs stromal microenvironment. Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) constitute an essential component of this stroma whereby Cortical (c) and medullary (m) TEC have distinct structural, antigenic and functional features. cTECs provide signals that commit hematopoietic precursor cells to a T cell fate and select those immature T cells for further differentiation that express a func-tionally competent T cell antigen receptor. In contrast, mTEC contribute to the establishment of self tolerance via the expression of peripheral tissue-speci c antigens (PTA). The research of the laboratory of Paediatric Immunology focuses on (i) a de-tailed understanding of the genetic and epigenetic control of TEC develop- ment and (ii) the functional potential of TEC to support the reconstitution of the T cell compartment following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). For this purpose, we have generated speci c genetic gain and loss of function mouse models that allow a precise interrogation of particular mo-lecular mechanisms relevant for thymus organogenesis and function. Our recent research has de ned the role of gene dosage for the transcription factor Foxn1 which is essential for the commitment of endodermal epithelial cells to a TEC fate. Moreover, studies have further characterised the impor-tance of the polycomb repressive complex 1 for the maintenance of this cell lineage commitment. Differences in DNA methylation and the generation of micro-RNA constitute additional epigenetic mechanims that we have identi- ed to play an essential role in TEC fate, maintenance and function, including the expression of PTA. The expression of some of these PTA is controlled by the nuclear protein Autoimmune Regulator (Aire). A comprehensive next generation sequencing transcriptome analysis of TEC subpopulations pro - cient or de cient in Aire expression further revealed that the thymic epitheli-al cell as a whole express virtually all protein coding genes including all tissue speci c antigens and that speci c TEC populations display a complex and in part lineage speci c gene expression pattern. Importantly for the underlying mechanism of promiscuous gene expression the loci of tissue-speci c genes are characterised by unique histone marks, which likely provide a molecular recognition for their transcription either by an Aire dependent or indepen-dent mechanism.In experiments that model allogeneic HSCT, we have furthermore demon-strated that the expression of the molecular mirror representing self-antigens by TEC is severely compromised in the context of acute graft-versus-host disease providing a mechanism for how autoimmunity develops as a conse-quence of thymus-directed alloimmunity.

Berger SNSF Ambizione-SCORE Department of Biomedicineand Division of Medical Outpatient ClinicUniversity Hospital Basel Group Members Marc Bigler (PhD student) arteritis - towards a better understanding of pathogenesis Failure of the immune system to discriminate self from non-self can result in autoimmune disease. An integrative model suggests that the balance be- tween auto-reactive T cells and so-called regulatory T cells (Tregs) dictates the likelihood to develop autoimmunity. We aim to test this hypothesis in patients with Giant cell arteritis (GCA), an autoimmune disease of the blood vessels. Both, IL-17 producing Th17 cells - that represent the prototype of auto-reactive effector T cells - and Tregs, have been linked to GCA patho- genesis. We will investigate, whether dysregulated Treg function contributes to disease pathogenesis, e.g. via insuf cient suppression of auto-aggressive T-cells or by inducing a Th17 promoting cytokine milieu. Following antigenic stimulation, T effector cells expand clonally. T cell recep- tor (TCR) sequencing can be used to assess the clonal T cell repertoire. In chronic infections, certain cancers and autoimmune diseases, T cell clones have been identi ed that occur frequently and are shared between different patients affected with the same disease (\"public T cell clones\"). Little is known about the TCR repertoire in GCA. We hypothesize that clonally ex-panded T cells detect self-antigens in GCA, which should be refl ected in a narrow TCR repertoire and the presence of public TCR. To test this hypothesis, we aim to de ne the TCR repertoire at the site of autoim- mune infl ammation in GCA, taking advantage of laser capture microdissec- tion of in ltrating T cells, combined with an unbiased PCR approach. Using computational epitope prediction tools, the target antigen will then be fur- ther characterized. As a clinical application, identi cation of disease-speci c TCR clonotypes in infl amed tissue would permit to track and characterize them in the peripheral blood, opening the possibility for highly speci c bio- marker-research. Connection to Clinical Practice PD Dr. Thomas Daikeler, Prof. Dr. Christoph Hess Division of Rheumatology and Department of Internal Medicine The Basler Giant Cell Arteritis Cohort Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most prevalent of the pri- mary vasculitis syndromes with an increasing disease inci- dence. Patients typically present with constitutional symp- toms, headache, and a systemic infl ammatory syndrome. To date therapy of GCA is based largely on steroids, and guid-ed by parameters refl ecting disease activity only partially, as indicated by recent imaging-studies. Furthermore, intensity and duration of steroid therapy remain a matter of debate, and no consensus exists in de ning remission. Both GCA it- self and the steroid based therapy are associated with signif- icant morbidity. Improving diagnostic accuracy and monitor-ing of disease activity thus would be of great importance. To study these clinical problems, we established a prospective interdisciplinary cohort of patients with GCA. Relevant clini- cal data, laboratory parameters, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from all patients are collected at longitu- dinal time-points. Vascular disease activity is assessed using new technologies such as color-coded duplex ultrasound and positron emission tomography. Thereby we aim at integrat- ing clinical data, imaging studies, and extended immunolog-ical and histomorphological assessments for a more detailed understanding of the immunopathogenesis of GCA. This may help to (i) further develop precise, ideally non-invasive, tools to diagnose and monitor disease activity, and (ii) generate strategies towards interfering with speci c pathways associ- ated with disease activity and/or complications.

How does the human body select ~10e12 T lymphocytes, that are reactive to foreign patho- gens but tolerant to normal cellular constituents of the host? The work of our laboratory seeks to understand the general principles by which a healthy individual's immune system achieves a state of self-tolerance. We are par-ticularly interested in how a tolerant T cell repertoire is selected during de-velopment and how it's maintained during adult life. The knowledge derived from our research may eventually impact organ transplantation and autoim-mune diseases.Over the last few years, we demonstrated that the af nity threshold for nega-tive selection is a constant for all thymocytes expressing MHC I restricted TCRs. This binding af nity threshold (KD = 6 M; estimated T1 2 2 sec) is a fundamental biophysical parameter used by developing CD8 lineage cells to establish a tolerant T cell repertoire. More recent experiments indicate that thymocytes destined to enter the CD4 lineage use an af nity threshold (KD = 300 M; estimated T1 2 0.1 sec) for negative selection that is 10-50 fold lower than that used for their CD8 lineage counterparts. These differ-ences are explained by the fraction of the corresponding co-receptor (CD8 or CD4) which carries the of CD8 vs 10% of CD4 molecules are loaded with lck. The emerging picture is that MHC I restricted thymocytes require a high af nity (longer duration) interaction between the TCR and the self-antigen to initiate negative selection because so few ( < 1%) of the CD8 co-receptor molecules carry lck. MHC II restricted thy- mocytes on the other hand undergo negative selection with a much lower af nity (shorter duration) interaction because a higher proportion (10%) of the CD4 molecules carry lck. Imaging studies and molecular modeling have provided evidence that an antigen engaged TCR must undergo hundreds of collisions with the relevant co-receptors to eventually engage a co-receptor molecule which actually carries the initiating kinase, lck. Based on the num-ber of molecules and the biophysical parameters describing their movement, we developed a mathematical model which describes a mechanism where the TCR can actually 'read' antigen af nity and establish an af nity (antigen dwell time) threshold for self-tolerance. We also examined the af nity threshold required for the induction of ex-perimental autoimmune diabetes. This involves the activation of the integrin LFA-1, formation of long-lasting T cell - antigen presenting cell conjugates, asymmetric cell division and differentiation into short-lived effector cells. Related to this, we are examining the origin of autoimmune T cells; they fre-quently express threshold af nity TCRs, which are inef ciently removed by clonal deletion. We are also trying to de ne the minimum number of T cells required to initiate an autoimmune disease.Another focus of the laboratory is to understand the basic biology of regula-tory T cells. Our experiments support the idea that Helios + FoxP3 + regula- tory T cells are survivors of negative selection in the thymus. This implies that the TCR repertoire expressed on Helios + regulatory T cells is high af nity anti-self. In vitro experiments demonstrated that Tregs require contact with MHC II expressing APCs and IL-2 from conventional T cells to proliferate. We are also using monoclonal Tregs and monoclonal Tconv cells to examine the basis of Treg mediated suppression. An additional project focuses on the role of regulatory T cells in maintaining peripheral tolerance.Finally, we studied the role if MHC II expression in intestinal epithelial cells. In mice speci cally lacking MHC II expression in this cell type, we observed an epithelial lymphocytosis.

In the research group Transplantation & Clinical Virology, we aim at characterizing 1) key determinants of virus biology, 2) potential targets of an-tiviral intervention, 3) relevant immune responses. This combined approach should allow to improve the risk strati cation and monitoring of patients, the identi cation of antiviral targets, and the design of protective vaccines and/or adoptive transfer of T-cells for clinical use.Community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) are detected by a multiplex PCR covering >16 different respiratory pathogens including Infl A and B, A/H1N1v with in the clinics for hematology, infectious diseases, and pneu-mology, we are characterizing virus epidemiology, and trying to link the qualitative and quantitative detection of viruses with clinical presentation and outcomes (Hirsch et al. 2013 Clin Inf Dis 56: 258). Human Herpes viruses (HHV) now members cyto-megalovirus Epstein-Barr (EBV). CMV and patients causing viral syndromes, organ-invasive disease and lymphoproliferative disorders such as PTLD. By integrating the replication biology of EBV the contribution of free EBV virion and viral episomal DNA from lysed cells to EBV load, we could develop a rst innovative mathematical model allowing to predict the impact of impaired T- cell function, T-cell depletion, and EBV infection recruiting new B-cells (Funk et al. 2007 Lancet Inf Dis 6: 460). The role of CMV, and speci cally the impact of antiviral prophylaxis versus preemptive therapy were studied in the frame of the Swiss Transplant Cohort Study suggesting that graft survival was better in patients receiving antiviral prophylaxis. CMV speci c T-cell function appears inactive, but can be re-stored in vitro using PD-1 receptor blockade. Our recent data support the use of viral loads assays using International Units according to the 1st CMV WHO standard. As a result, International Units for CMV are now recom-mended in international guidelines (see refs.).Human Polyomaviruses (HPyV) now consist of 12 different species, 9 of which have only been discovered since 2007. Signi cant human diseases are recognized for BK virus (BKV), JC virus (JCV), Merkel cell carcinoma and Trichodysplasia spinulosa PyV, all of which arise almost exclusively in immunocompromized patients. BKV causes PyV-associated nephropathy (PyVAN) in kidney transplant patients and late-onset hemorrhagic cystitis in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We established that PyVAN is pre- ceded by high-level BKV viruria with decoy shedding and an international 1:1 randomized-controlled trial comparing tacrolimus with cyclosporine in 682 de novo kidney transplant recipients, we found that BKV viremia was more frequent and higher in the tacrolimus arm posttransplant (see refs.). Based on BKV viremia, reducing immunosuppression becomes an ef cient intervention strategy. Accordingly, screening kidney transplant patients for plasma BKV loads is now recommended by international guide-lines to identify kidney patients at risk for BKV disease. We speculate that BKV proteins subvert innate and adaptive immune responses (see refs.).

In order to nd the properly designed control strategy that aims at lowering the number of an avian pest, the thor-ough understanding of the population processes of the considered species is needed. Estimates of demographic parameters as natality, mortality, im-migration and emigration and of their variability are crucial when selecting an appropriate control strategy. These evaluations provide sensible hints regarding the feasibility of the intended control method itself. In the city of Basel we run nine feral pigeon lofts for more than 20 years providing broad scienti c data. Recent results prove that only a small part of the breeding pairs, less than 10 percent, is able to compensate for losses due to mortality. Control strategies that encompass less than 90% of the breeding pairs there-fore are unable to reduce a population. The only way to solve the pigeon problem is the reduction of the food supply by collaborating with general public. Ectoparasites of feral pigeons and their reactions towards host- related stimuli The close coexistence of large feral pigeon populations and humans in our cities implicates serious health risks. Several ectoparasites known to infest humans can migrate into human living space. Especially after their natural hosts are excluded from roosting and nesting areas ectoparasites search for new alternative hosts. We study the host seeking behavior of signi cant human pathogenic feral pigeon ectoparasites. One of these important ecto-parasites is the pigeon tick Argas refl exus. Being able to starve for years, A. refl exus can hide unnoticeably in the cracks and crevices of buildings. When biting a human host, the severity of the reaction to the bite can vary from mild symptoms to life-threatening conditions. With our study we hope to provide information about the main stimuli, which lead the parasites to their hosts. Furthermore we wish to contribute to a risk assessment for humans living close to feral pigeon nests or adjacent to buildings infested with feral pigeons. Preventing wild boar (Sus scrofa) damage in agriculture - investiga- tion of deterrent systems To prevent economic problems by high wild boar populations, an effective wild boar management has to be established. Besides the regulation of the populations by means of hunting, vulnerable crop elds have to be protected adequately. Crop protection is usually achieved by the use of electric fences, which is costly and time-consuming since fences need regular maintenance. Alternatively, various methods are available that claim effective deterrence of wild boars, however most of them lack scienti c proof. In our study con- ducted in the Canton Basel-Land we investigated the effectiveness of solar-powered blinkers, an odour repellent, and a gustatory repellent in eld ex-periments with free-ranging wild boars.Solar blinkers and the odour repellent, which were investigated at baited lur-ing sites, reduced the probability of wild boar visits by 8.1% and by 0.4% re-spectively. The gustatory repellent, which was investigated in experimental elds, did not have a signi cant effect on the frequency of damage events.Our study revealed, that none of the deterrents investigated was able to pre-vent wild boars from entering the experimental sites. To date, the only rec-ommendable means for damage prevention is the electric fence. Our results contribute to an assessment of legal foundations and common practice of eld protection, compensation payments, and hunting by cantonal veteri-nary- and game authorities.

Physiologically, Ca 2+ signals result both from the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores as well as infl ux from the extracellular envi- ronment, via the opening of channels on the plasma membrane. In skeletal muscle, Ca 2+ regulates contraction and relaxation and alterations in its intra- cellular concentration can lead to several neuromuscular disorders. Investi-gations carried out during the past decade have shown that in more than 50% of the cases, Central Core Disease, Multi-minicore disease and Malignant Hyperthermia are linked to point mutations in the gene encoding the skeletal muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release channel ryanodine receptor (RyR1), which is a key protein involved in releasing the calcium from the sar-coplasmic reticulum after plasma membrane depolarization. Indeed to date more than 200 missense mutations in the RYR1 gene have been identi ed in patients and associated to the Central core disease, Multiminicore disease, Congenital Fiber type disproportion, Centronuclear phenotype.There are three isoforms of the ryanodine receptor that are expressed in dif-ferent tissues; type 1 is preferentially expressed in skeletal muscles but recent data has shown that it is also expressed in some areas of the central nervous system, in some immune cells and in smooth muscle cells. These results im-ply that mutations in RYR1 (the gene encoding RyR1) may lead to alterations of Ca 2+ homeostasis not only in skeletal muscle, but also in other tissues ex- pressing this intracellular calcium release channel. Indeed ryanodinopathies have recently been implicated in other clinical conditions such as sepsis and intensive care polyneuropathy, broadening the clinical spectrum of disorders linked to altered RyR1functions. The aims of our research are to broaden our knowledge of ryanodinopa- thies. We plan to investigate the mechanism by which recessive mutations in RYR1 linked to some forms of Multiminicore Disease, Centronuclear myopathy and Congenital Fiber Type disproportion lead to a drastic de-crease in RyR1 content in muscle biopsies. In addition, we will investigate the expression pro le of major proteins involved in calcium homeostasis, in human ocular muscles. This is important in order to understand why some patients affected by neuromuscular disorders linked to recessive RYR1 mu-tations exhibit eye muscle involvement (ptosis, ophthalmoplegia) but other patients, particularly those with dominant RYR1 mutations which alter chan-nel function, do not. Finally we will investigate the role of RyR1 in smooth muscle cells and determine if mutations in RYR1 can cause alterations in bleeding times. This is important because prolonged bleeding times have been reported in some patients with dominant RYR1 mutations linked to Malignant Hyperthermia. Finally by pursuing a proteomic approach of the endo(sarco)plasmic reticulum, the organelle responsible for calcium homeostasis in muscle and non-muscle cells we have characterized at the molecular and functional level a number of proteins including junctate, JP-45, SRP-35. SRP-27. For JP-45 we have made a knock-out animal model which has yielded important information on calcium infl ux occurring in skeletal muscle during excitation-contraction coupling. In the future we plan on screening the gene encoding human JP45 (JSRP1) for polymorphic variants in order to study their role in neuromuscular disorders. For SRP-35, a 35 kDa a retinol dehydrogenase, that we hypothesize links muscle contraction to the activation of metabolism we have recently made a transgenic animal. We think that this animal model will offer important insight Prof. Dr. Thierry GirardConnection to Clinical Practice Personalized medicine in anaesthesia and intensive care Pharmacogenetics deals with infl uences of individual genetic pro les on the mode of action or duration of action of phar-maceutical agents. Potent drugs with fast onset and short du-ration of action are typical for anaesthesia and intensive care treatment. At the same time physiological parameters, such as cardiac function, oxygen consumption, CO2 production, core body temperature, renal function and brain activity as well as neuromuscular transmission are measured and controlled.Skeletal muscle is the largest human organ, with a high met-abolic activity. Mutations in skeletal muscle type 1 ryanodine receptor gene (RYR1) predispose for malignant hyperthermia (MH), a hypermetabolic disease with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. However, in about 25% of families with MH mutation screening RYR1 supports the view that MH is a heterogenetic disorder. If not immediately treated, MH might be lethal. The search for further genetic loci causing MH will facilitate presymptomatic diagnosis. Calcium homeostasis and excitation contraction coupling play an important role in a patient's reaction to anesthetic agents and /or in the outcome of general anaesthesia. Thus, one aim of our research is the identi cation and characterization of polymor-phic variants of genes encoding proteins involved in excitation contraction coupling. Further elds of interest are the effect of anaesthetic agents on ion channels, such as chloride and sodi-um channels of normal and myopathic muscles and molecular mechanisms of muscle atrophy and force reduction, because intact skeletal muscle function is crucial for a successful reha-bilitation of patients treated on intensive care units.

The N-terminal and central domains interact with one another to stabilize the closed con guration of the channel. When this interac-tion is disrupted and 'unzipped', by means of a competing synthetic domain pep-tide, pathogenic mutation, or physiological activation, the channel becomes desta-bilized and allows the passage of calcium ions through the pore.
