It's really a matter of health as some pests carry diseases and bring in outside germs. In the pest control industry, there are several pest control techniques frequently used to control the vermin population. Unfortunately, some of those solutions include using unnecessarily potent chemicals and poisons. These are the same chemicals that could be putting your family or employees at risk since they also occupy the same space. When pest control companies overuse these chemicals, it can pose a big risk for those who live and occupy those spaces. Even if they don't come into direct contact with the chemicals or consume the poison, there is still a chance for them to be exposed to toxic fumes due to microparticles remaining in the air after the extermination process is complete.

Insects Flea trap If you've ever had a pet you know just big of a problem, fleas can be. Not only is it a nuisance for your dog or cat, but for humans as well. Flea traps can be an effective solution. A flea trap uses heat and light (not toxins) to attract fleas from up to 30 feet away and then super-strong glue keeps them from escaping the trap.

Health Effects From Toxic Pest Control While it is true that traditional toxic chemicals are still widely used for natural pest control, it may not be the best method for your situation. Extermination companies that claim it's more efficient and quicker than other methods, they may not be telling the whole story. We believe that your family's health and safety is a significant factor when recommending the most appropriate treatment plan for your pest problem. Is going with the cheapest and quickest option really worth the risk of health and wellness to your family? For toxic pesticides to be effective they must have an active component to control the pest. This can be biologically harmful and toxic not only for animals but for humans as well. Because of this, it is possible for humans to be affected by these chemicals even without direct contact. Here are three ways your body can absorb these chemicals Respiratory entry This is the most common and easiest way for people to be affected by pesticides. When these harmful chemicals are sprayed in the home or office, indistinguishable vapors or powders can be inhaled. Since these are generally microparticles, they are not noticeable as they float in the air. Even long after the area has been treated with pesticides. Toxins leftover in the air can pass through the mouth and nose and go straight to the lungs causing trouble breathing leading to possible infection or even poisoning. Oral entry Leftover toxins from chemical extermination can rest on food and liquids in our home. Later, unknowingly, we drink and eat these things which are contaminated. Also, pesticides could be found on your hand from services that were treated. That means when you touch your food or lick your fingers, the toxic chemical residue can enter the body. You may also be spreading pesticides around your face and nose whenever you touch your face. Dermal entry When pesticides in spray or powders land on the body, they can be absorbed through the skin and eyes. Residual pesticides in the air are commonly absorbed very quickly through the skin. Pesticides can cause skin to turn red or itchy. If enough pesticides are absorbed into the skin, it can make you very sick. Immediate health effects When you come into direct contact with pesticides or poison there are some immediate and visible effects that can affect people's health. For example, irritation of the nose and throat. If skin is exposed it can cause burning, stinging, and itching as well as rashes and hives. After significant exposure you may experience nausea, dizziness, and diarrhea. People with asthma may have very severe reactions to some pesticides causing trouble breathing and eventually serious lung ailments. Some pesticides cause side effects that are often confused with other illnesses due to the similarity of the symptoms. In some cases, pesticide poisoning may exhibit symptoms of a cold or flu. This makes it hard to determine whether or not you've been exposed to an unhealthy level of pesticides. We always recommend you seek immediate medical attention if you think you've been exposed to pesticides or rodent poisons. Get Your Free Quote Now Long Term Health Effects In some cases there are long-term health effects from being exposed to chemical pesticides. These are the most dangerous because there may be no immediate symptoms, and people don't seek medical attention until they are symptomatic. That delay could lead to life-threatening diseases such as cancer, brain tumors, and nervous system damage. Some studies have shown that long-term exposure to chemical pesticides can lead to reproductive problems and damage to vital organs such as the liver, kidneys, lungs, and other body organs. Scientists and experts have studied the effects of pesticides on leukemia, lymphoma, and other cancers. Pregnant women are especially in danger when exposed to pesticides or different kinds of poison, because it may lead to birth defects and other life-threatening damage. Also, men are in danger when it comes to their reproductive system if they are exposed to strong chemicals and poisons, leading to sterility in some cases. Some pesticides act as endocrine disruptors and have been shown to cause serious harm to animals, including cancer, sterility, and developmental problems. Similar impacts have been associated with human exposure to these chemicals.

Kid and pet friendly This is maybe the most important factor to keep in mind when considering whether or not to use chemicals for pest control.

So, even if toxic extermination products may appear to be more economical, it doesn't compare to the medical expenses and anguish that could potentially come if someone's health was compromised.

While many homeowners choose to use toxic chemicals as their means of termite pest control in Frisco, TX, there are several basic organic ingredients that can effectively reduce and prevent termite infestations in your home. There are about 300 [different types of termites](https://safepropest.com/termites-in-texas/) throughout the world, but only four of them are found in the U.S. Of the four located here, the subterranean termite is the most problematic. Below are three non-toxic solutions to fighting off termites in and around your home. Sand Barrier Method Termites have difficulty tunneling through sand of larger grain sizes. In addition, sand does not absorb the moisture that termites need to colonize. Building a sand barrier is an effective method of preventing underground invasions of termites. These barriers can be built in many different locations including crawl spaces; under foundations and between concrete patios, porches and steps. They can also be applied near electrical and telephone poles, fence posts and underground utility lines. To build these, you will need 16-grit-sized sand, and the barrier should be a minimum of four inches in depth. This method of pest control offers a long-term solution to a possible infestation problem. However, it should be inspected regularly to be sure it is working effectively. Nematode Method Nematodes are a type of microscopic worm that works as an effective method of termite control. These threadlike organisms contain a bacterium chemical in their guts. By releasing them near termite nests, the nematodes are able to feed on the pests, releasing the bacterium into the insects and destroying them. Once the nematodes have destroyed all of the available termites, they too die and become biodegraded into the soil. The simplest means of using the nematodes is to combine them with water and apply the mixture with a spray bottle to the termite nest areas. The nematodes are typically able to destroy the termites in less than 48 hours. Cedar Oil Method Cedar oil is an organic, non-toxic substance that is quite lethal to termites. It can be used effectively on any structures made from wood. As the oil penetrates the wood, the odor it produces begins to confuse the termites breathing system and cause a self-destruction response. The oil also dissolves the eggs and larvae, destroying the future termite generation, while the scent of the cedar interrupts pheromone signals, creating a barrier to the arrival of more termites. Cedar oil should be applied to all wood surfaces including crevices and end pieces. It is an effective method of termite pest control for both indoors and outside.
