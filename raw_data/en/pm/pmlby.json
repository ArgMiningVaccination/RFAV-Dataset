Proponents say that vaccination is safe and one of the greatest health developments of the 20th century. Opponents say that children's immune systems can deal with most infections naturally, and that injecting questionable vaccine ingredients into a child may cause side effects, including seizures, paralysis, and death. This statistic shows the percentage of children in the U.S. who received all doses of recommended vaccines in 2017. It was found that in that year around 91.5 percent of children aged 19 to 35 months had received all their doses of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It is a truism that acting in one's perceived self-interest is not always in one's self-interest. Perhaps nowhere is this truer in contemporary public health than for the issue of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) immunization and persistent fears about a possible connection with autism. Although each of these 3 diseases had been controlled in the United States with the widespread use of the MMR vaccine, in the past decade those gains have been slipping. How do vaccines help babies fight infections? How do vaccines work with your child's immune system to fight infections? \"A must-read . . . Takes you inside a child's gut and shows you how to give kids the best immune start early in life.\" --William Sears, MD, coauthor of The Baby Book Like the culture-changing Last Child in the Woods, here is the first parenting book to apply the latest cutting-edge scientific research about the human microbiome to the way we raise our children. In the two hundred years since we discovered that microbes cause infectious diseases, we've battled to keep them at bay. But a recent explosion of scientific knowledge has led to undeniable evidence that early exposure to these organisms is beneficial to a child's well-being. Our modern lifestyle, with its emphasis on hyper-cleanliness, is taking a toll on children's lifelong health. In this engaging and important book, microbiologists Brett Finlay and Marie-Claire Arrieta explain how the trillions of microbes that live in and on our bodies influence childhood development; why an imbalance of those microbes can lead to obesity, diabetes, and asthma, among other chronic conditions; and what parents can do--from conception on--to positively affect their own behaviors and those of their children. They describe how natural childbirth, breastfeeding, and solid foods influence children's microbiota. They also offer practical advice on matters such as whether to sterilize food implements for babies, the use of antibiotics, the safety of vaccines, and why having pets is a good idea. Forward-thinking and revelatory, Let Them Eat Dirt is an essential book in helping us to nurture stronger, more resilient, happy, and healthy kids. Do Vaccines Cause Autism, Asthma, Diabetes? Get straight, science-based answers to this and other questions about the safety of vaccines. In this book you will find the facts--no advocating hype or anti-vaccine propaganda.

It should be required reading for parents who have vaccine concerns.\" Ari Brown, MD, FAAP, Pediatrician and author of Baby 411 \" ... lays bare the science of vaccine safety and examines the increasingly bitter debate between the public health establishment and a formidable populist coalition of parents, celebrities, politicians and activists who are armed with the latest social media tools ... and are determined to resist pressure from the medical and public health establishments to vaccinate, despite established scientific consensus about vaccine safety.\"--Frontline website.
