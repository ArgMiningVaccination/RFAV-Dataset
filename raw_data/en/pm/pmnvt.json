While traditional treatments like topical steroids offer some relief, functional medicine provides a new hope for those suffering from psoriasis.", "sitename": "CentreSpring MD", "date": "2023-07-31", "cleaned_text": "Conventional vs. Integrative Medicine: A Paradigm Shift The conventional approach to psoriasis often relies on topical creams, light therapy, and systemic medications to manage symptoms [(4)](https://www.psoriasis.org/treatments-for-psoriatic-disease/). While these methods may provide temporary relief, they rarely address the underlying causes and may come with side effects. The integrative medicine approach, on the other hand, seeks to understand the unique factors contributing to each individual's psoriasis and focuses on a holistic treatment plan. By addressing the root causes, integrative medicine aims to put psoriasis into remission and improve overall well-being. The Power of Integrative Treatment Methods A functional medicine approach to psoriasis usually involves a combination of dietary changes, supplements, lifestyle modifications, and stress management techniques. Nutrition A nutrient-rich diet is essential for optimal health. Eating whole foods rich in antioxidants can help protect against oxidative damage and reduce inflammation. Adopting [an anti-inflammatory diet](https://centrespringmd.com/top-5-anti-inflammatory-foods-anti-inflammatory-diet/) rich in fruits, vegetables, and [omega-3 fatty acids](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/nordic-naturals-omega-3-phospholipids/) can significantly reduce psoriasis symptoms by suppressing inflammatory pathways [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432353/). Eliminating processed foods and allergens like gluten and dairy may also improve symptoms for people who are sensitive to these foods. Gut Health Restoration Evidence suggests that a [leaky gut or an unhealthy microbiome](https://centrespringmd.com/how-to-heal-leaky-gut/) plays a role in the development of psoriasis [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432353/). Supporting gut health through probiotics, prebiotics, and targeted supplements can rebalance the gut microbiome, positively impacting skin health. Stress Management The physiological effects of stress are known culprits for [autoimmune flare-ups](https://centrespringmd.com/the-hidden-triggers-of-autoimmune-disease-integrative-medicine-explains/). Mind-body practices like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises help reduce stress and its impact on psoriasis. Nutritional Supplements Specific nutrients like vitamin D, zinc, and fish oil can aid in reducing inflammation and promoting skin healing [(5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7432353/). Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine [Acupuncture](https://centrespringmd.com/services/acupuncture/), as one of complementary and alternative nonpharmacological therapies, has been commonly used in the management of psoriasis in China [(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154484/). It's associated with a lower recurrence rate of psoriasis [(7)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26021960/). Compared with conventional medications, one meta-analysis reported that acupuncture may show a potential advantage in the management of the psychosocial side effects of psoriasis including anxiety, depression, and so on [(6)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8154484/). Herbal Remedies Certain herbs, like turmeric and aloe vera, have anti-inflammatory properties and may support skin health [(8)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5816303/). [Curcumin](https://centrespringmd.com/shop/numedica-liposomal-curcumin-30-svgs/), which is the biologically active component of turmeric, has a wide range of uses, including as a potential treatment for chronic inflammatory conditions [(9)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22118895/).
