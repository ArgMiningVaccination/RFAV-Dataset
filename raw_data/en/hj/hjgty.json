Wilhelm von Humboldt: Sphere and Duties of Government . To the beloved and deplored memory of her who was the inspirer, and in part the author, of all that is best in my writings- the friend and wifewhose exalted sense of truth and right was my strongest incitement, andwhose approbation was my chief reward\u2014I dedicate this volume. Likeall that I have written for many years, it belongs as much to her as tome; but the work as it stands has had, in a very insufficient degree, theinestimable advantage of her revision; some of the most important por-tions having been reserved for a more careful re-examination, whichthey are now never destined to receive. Were I but capable of interpret-ing to the world one half the great thoughts and noble feelings which areburied in her grave, I should be the medium of a greater benefit to it,than is ever likely to arise from anything that I can write, unpromptedand unassisted by her all but unrivalled wisdom.6/John Stuart Mill Chapter 1 Introductory The subject of this Essay is not the so-called Liberty of the Will, sounfortunately opposed to the misnamed doctrine of Philosophical Ne-cessity; but Civil, or Social Liberty: the nature and limits of the powerwhich can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual. Aquestion seldom stated, and hardly ever discussed, in general terms, butwhich profoundly influences the practical controversies of the age by itslatent presence, and is likely soon to make itself recognised as the vitalquestion of the future. It is so far from being new, that, in a certainsense, it has divided mankind, almost from the remotest ages; but in thestage of progress into which the more civilised portions of the specieshave now entered, it presents itself under new conditions, and requires adifferent and more fundamental treatment. The struggle between Liberty and Authority is the most conspicu- ous feature in the portions of history with which we are earliest familiar,particularly in that of Greece, Rome, and England. But in old times thiscontest was between subjects, or some classes of subjects, and the Gov-ernment. By liberty, was meant protection against the tyranny of thepolitical rulers. The rulers were conceived (except in some of the popu-lar governments of Greece) as in a necessarily antagonistic position tothe people whom they ruled. They consisted of a governing One, or agoverning tribe or caste, who derived their authority from inheritance orconquest, who, at all events, did not hold it at the pleasure of the gov-erned, and whose supremacy men did not venture, perhaps did not de-sire, to contest, whatever precautions might be taken against its oppres-sive exercise. Their power was regarded as necessary, but also as highlydangerous; as a weapon which they would attempt to use against theirsubjects, no less than against external enemies. To prevent the weakermembers of the community from being preyed upon by innumerablevultures, it was needful that there should be an animal of prey strongerthan the rest, commissioned to keep them down. But as the king of thevultures would be no less bent upon preying on the flock than any of theminor harpies, it was indispensable to be in a perpetual attitude of de-fence against his beak and claws. The aim, therefore, of patriots was toset limits to the power which the ruler should be suffered to exerciseover the community; and this limitation was what they meant by liberty.It was attempted in two ways. First, by obtaining a recognition of cer-tain immunities, called political liberties or rights, which it was to beOn Liberty/7 regarded as a breach of duty in the ruler to infringe, and which if he did infringe, specific resistance, or general rebellion, was held to be justifi-able. A second, and generally a later expedient, was the establishmentof constitutional checks, by which the consent of the community, or of abody of some sort, supposed to represent its interests, was made a nec-essary condition to some of the more important acts of the governingpower. To the first of these modes of limitation, the ruling power, inmost European countries, was compelled, more or less, to submit. Itwas not so with the second; and, to attain this, or when already in somedegree possessed, to attain it more completely, became everywhere theprincipal object of the lovers of liberty. And so long as mankind werecontent to combat one enemy by another, and to be ruled by a master, oncondition of being guaranteed more or less efficaciously against his tyr-anny, they did not carry their aspirations beyond this point. A time, however, came, in the progress of human affairs, when men ceased to think it a necessity of nature that their governors should be anindependent power, opposed in interest to themselves. It appeared tothem much better that the various magistrates of the State should betheir tenants or delegates, revocable at their pleasure. In that way alone,it seemed, could they have complete security that the powers of govern-ment would never be abused to their disadvantage. By degrees this newdemand for elective and temporary rulers became the prominent objectof the exertions of the popular party, wherever any such party existed;and superseded, to a considerable extent, the previous efforts to limitthe power of rulers. As the struggle proceeded for making the rulingpower emanate from the periodical choice of the ruled, some personsbegan to think that too much importance had been attached to the limi-tation of the power itself. That (it might seem) was a resource againstrulers whose interests were habitually opposed to those of the people.What was now wanted was, that the rulers should be identified with thepeople; that their interest and will should be the interest and will of thenation. The nation did not need to be protected against its own will.There was no fear of its tyrannising over itself. Let the rulers be effectu-ally responsible to it, promptly removable by it, and it could afford totrust them with power of which it could itself dictate the use to be made.Their power was but the nation's own power, concentrated, and in aform convenient for exercise. This mode of thought, or rather perhapsof feeling, was common among the last generation of European liberal-ism, in the Continental section of which it still apparently predominates.8/John Stuart Mill Those who admit any limit to what a government may do, except in the case of such governments as they think ought not to exist, stand out asbrilliant exceptions among the political thinkers of the Continent. Asimilar tone of sentiment might by this time have been prevalent in ourown country, if the circumstances which for a time encouraged it, hadcontinued unaltered. But, in political and philosophical theories, as well as in persons, success discloses faults and infirmities which failure might have con-cealed from observation. The notion, that the people have no need tolimit their power over themselves, might seem axiomatic, when populargovernment was a thing only dreamed about, or read of as having ex-isted at some distant period of the past. Neither was that notion neces-sarily disturbed by such temporary aberrations as those of the FrenchRevolution, the worst of which were the work of a usurping few, andwhich, in any case, belonged, not to the permanent working of popularinstitutions, but to a sudden and convulsive outbreak against monarchi-cal and aristocratic despotism. In time, however, a democratic republiccame to occupy a large portion of the earth's surface, and made itselffelt as one of the most powerful members of the community of nations;and elective and responsible government became subject to the observa-tions and criticisms which wait upon a great existing fact. It was nowperceived that such phrases as \"self-government,\" and \"the power ofthe people over themselves,\" do not express the true state of the case.The \"people\" who exercise the power are not always the same peoplewith those over whom it is exercised; and the \"self-government\" spokenof is not the government of each by himself, but of each by all the rest.The will of the people, moreover, practically means the will of the mostnumerous or the most active part of the people; the majority, or thosewho succeed in making themselves accepted as the majority; the people,consequently may desire to oppress a part of their number; and precau-tions are as much needed against this as against any other abuse ofpower. The limitation, therefore, of the power of government over indi-viduals loses none of its importance when the holders of power are regu-larly accountable to the community, that is, to the strongest party therein.This view of things, recommending itself equally to the intelligence ofthinkers and to the inclination of those important classes in Europeansociety to whose real or supposed interests democracy is adverse, hashad no difficulty in establishing itself; and in political speculations \"thetyranny of the majority\" is now generally included among the evils againstOn Liberty/9 which society requires to be on its guard. Like other tyrannies, the tyranny of the majority was at first, and is still vulgarly, held in dread, chiefly as operating through the acts of thepublic authorities. But reflecting persons perceived that when society isitself the tyrant\u2014society collectively over the separate individuals whocompose it\u2014its means of tyrannising are not restricted to the acts whichit may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can anddoes execute its own mandates: and if it issues wrong mandates insteadof right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not tomeddle, it practises a social tyranny more formidable than many kindsof political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such ex-treme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much moredeeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection,therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough: there needsprotection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling;against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civilpenalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those whodissent from them; to fetter the development, and, if possible, preventthe formation, of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, andcompels all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own.There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion withindividual independence: and to find that limit, and maintain it againstencroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs,as protection against political despotism. But though this proposition is not likely to be contested in general terms, the practical question, where to place the limit\u2014how to make thefitting adjustment between individual independence and social control\u2014is a subject on which nearly everything remains to be done. All thatmakes existence valuable to any one, depends on the enforcement ofrestraints upon the actions of other people. Some rules of conduct, there-fore, must be imposed, by law in the first place, and by opinion on manythings which are not fit subjects for the operation of law. What theserules should be is the principal question in human affairs; but if weexcept a few of the most obvious cases, it is one of those which leastprogress has been made in resolving. No two ages, and scarcely any twocountries, have decided it alike; and the decision of one age or country isa wonder to another. Yet the people of any given age and country nomore suspect any difficulty in it, than if it were a subject on whichmankind had always been agreed. The rules which obtain among them-10/John Stuart Mill selves appear to them self-evident and self-justifying. This all but universal illusion is one of the examples of the magical influence of custom, which is not only, as the proverb says, a secondnature, but is continually mistaken for the first. The effect of custom, inpreventing any misgiving respecting the rules of conduct which man-kind impose on one another, is all the more complete because the subjectis one on which it is not generally considered necessary that reasonsshould be given, either by one person to others or by each to himself.People are accustomed to believe, and have been encouraged in the be-lief by some who aspire to the character of philosophers, that their feel-ings, on subjects of this nature, are better than reasons, and render rea-sons unnecessary. The practical principle which guides them to theiropinions on the regulation of human conduct, is the feeling in eachperson's mind that everybody should be required to act as he, and thosewith whom he sympathises, would like them to act. No one, indeed,acknowledges to himself that his standard of judgment is his own liking;but an opinion on a point of conduct, not supported by reasons, can onlycount as one person's preference; and if the reasons, when given, are amere appeal to a similar preference felt by other people, it is still onlymany people's liking instead of one. To an ordinary man, however, hisown preference, thus supported, is not only a perfectly satisfactory rea-son, but the only one he generally has for any of his notions of morality,taste, or propriety, which are not expressly written in his religious creed;and his chief guide in the interpretation even of that. Men's opinions,accordingly, on what is laudable or blamable, are affected by all themultifarious causes which influence their wishes in regard to the con-duct of others, and which are as numerous as those which determinetheir wishes on any other subject. Sometimes their reason\u2014at othertimes their prejudices or superstitions: often their social affections, notseldom their antisocial ones, their envy or jealousy, their arrogance orcontemptuousness: but most commonly their desires or fears for them-selves\u2014their legitimate or illegitimate self-interest. Wherever there is an ascendant class, a large portion of the morality of the country emanates from its class interests, and its feelings of classsuperiority. The morality between Spartans and Helots, between plant-ers and negroes, between princes and subjects, between nobles androturiers, between men and women, has been for the most part the cre-ation of these class interests and feelings: and the sentiments thus gener-ated react in turn upon the moral feelings of the members of the ascen-On Liberty/11 dant class, in their relations among themselves. Where, on the other hand, a class, formerly ascendant, has lost its ascendancy, or where itsascendancy is unpopular, the prevailing moral sentiments frequently bearthe impress of an impatient dislike of superiority. Another grand deter-mining principle of the rules of conduct, both in act and forbearance,which have been enforced by law or opinion, has been the servility ofmankind towards the supposed preferences or aversions of their tempo-ral masters or of their gods. This servility, though essentially selfish, isnot hypocrisy; it gives rise to perfectly genuine sentiments of abhor-rence; it made men burn magicians and heretics. Among so many baserinfluences, the general and obvious interests of society have of coursehad a share, and a large one, in the direction of the moral sentiments:less, however, as a matter of reason, and on their own account, than asa consequence of the sympathies and antipathies which grew out ofthem: and sympathies and antipathies which had little or nothing to dowith the interests of society, have made themselves felt in the establish-ment of moralities with quite as great force. The likings and dislikings of society, or of some powerful portion of it, are thus the main thing which has practically determined the ruleslaid down for general observance, under the penalties of law or opinion.And in general, those who have been in advance of society in thoughtand feeling, have left this condition of things unassailed in principle,however they may have come into conflict with it in some of its details.They have occupied themselves rather in inquiring what things societyought to like or dislike, than in questioning whether its likings or dislikingsshould be a law to individuals. They preferred endeavouring to alter thefeelings of mankind on the particular points on which they were them-selves heretical, rather than make common cause in defence of freedom,with heretics generally. The only case in which the higher ground hasbeen taken on principle and maintained with consistency, by any but anindividual here and there, is that of religious belief: a case instructive inmany ways, and not least so as forming a most striking instance of thefallibility of what is called the moral sense: for the odium theologicum,in a sincere bigot, is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling.Those who first broke the yoke of what called itself the Universal Church,were in general as little willing to permit difference of religious opinionas that church itself. But when the heat of the conflict was over, withoutgiving a complete victory to any party, and each church or sect wasreduced to limit its hopes to retaining possession of the ground it al-12/John Stuart Mill ready occupied; minorities, seeing that they had no chance of becoming majorities, were under the necessity of pleading to those whom theycould not convert, for permission to differ. It is accordingly on this battlefield, almost solely, that the rights of the individual against society havebeen asserted on broad grounds of principle, and the claim of society toexercise authority over dissentients openly controverted. The great writersto whom the world owes what religious liberty it possesses, have mostlyasserted freedom of conscience as an indefeasible right, and denied ab-solutely that a human being is accountable to others for his religiousbelief. Yet so natural to mankind is intolerance in whatever they reallycare about, that religious freedom has hardly anywhere been practicallyrealised, except where religious indifference, which dislikes to have itspeace disturbed by theological quarrels, has added its weight to the scale.In the minds of almost all religious persons, even in the most tolerantcountries, the duty of toleration is admitted with tacit reserves. Oneperson will bear with dissent in matters of church government, but notof dogma; another can tolerate everybody, short of a Papist or a Unitar-ian; another every one who believes in revealed religion; a few extendtheir charity a little further, but stop at the belief in a God and in a futurestate. Wherever the sentiment of the majority is still genuine and in-tense, it is found to have abated little of its claim to be obeyed. In England, from the peculiar circumstances of our political his- tory, though the yoke of opinion is perhaps heavier, that of law is lighter,than in most other countries of Europe; and there is considerable jeal-ousy of direct interference, by the legislative or the executive power,with private conduct; not so much from any just regard for the indepen-dence of the individual, as from the still subsisting habit of looking onthe government as representing an opposite interest to the public. Themajority have not yet learnt to feel the power of the government theirpower, or its opinions their opinions. When they do so, individual lib-erty will probably be as much exposed to invasion from the govern-ment, as it already is from public opinion. But, as yet, there is a consid-erable amount of feeling ready to be called forth against any attempt ofthe law to control individuals in things in which they have not hithertobeen accustomed to be controlled by it; and this with very little discrimi-nation as to whether the matter is, or is not, within the legitimate sphereof legal control; insomuch that the feeling, highly salutary on the whole,is perhaps quite as often misplaced as well grounded in the particularinstances of its application. There is, in fact, no recognised principle byOn Liberty/13 which the propriety or impropriety of government interference is cus- tomarily tested. People decide according to their personal preferences.Some, whenever they see any good to be done, or evil to be remedied,would willingly instigate the government to undertake the business; whileothers prefer to bear almost any amount of social evil, rather than addone to the departments of human interests amenable to governmentalcontrol. And men range themselves on one or the other side in any par-ticular case, according to this general direction of their sentiments; oraccording to the degree of interest which they feel in the particular thingwhich it is proposed that the government should do, or according to thebelief they entertain that the government would, or would not, do it inthe manner they prefer; but very rarely on account of any opinion towhich they consistently adhere, as to what things are fit to be done by agovernment. And it seems to me that in consequence of this absence ofrule or principle, one side is at present as of wrong as the other; theinterference of government is, with about equal frequency, improperlyinvoked and improperly condemned. The object of this Essay is to assert one very simple principle, as entitled to govern absolutely the dealings of society with the individualin the way of compulsion and control, whether the means used be physi-cal force in the form of legal penalties, or the moral coercion of publicopinion. That principle is, that the sole end for which mankind are war-ranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of ac-tion of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose forwhich power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilisedcommunity, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good,either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot right-fully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to doso, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others,to do so would be wise, or even right. These are good reasons for re-monstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, orentreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evilin case he do otherwise. To justify that, the conduct from which it isdesired to deter him must be calculated to produce evil to some one else.The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable tosociety, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely con-cerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, overhis own body and mind, the individual is sovereign. It is, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that this doctrine is meant to14/John Stuart Mill apply only to human beings in the maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children, or of young persons below the age which the lawmay fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in astate to require being taken care of by others, must be protected againsttheir own actions as well as against external injury. For the same rea-son, we may leave out of consideration those backward states of societyin which the race itself may be considered as in its nonage. The earlydifficulties in the way of spontaneous progress are so great, that there isseldom any choice of means for overcoming them; and a ruler full of thespirit of improvement is warranted in the use of any expedients that willattain an end, perhaps otherwise unattainable. Despotism is a legitimatemode of government in dealing with barbarians, provided the end betheir improvement, and the means justified by actually effecting thatend. Liberty, as a principle, has no application to any state of thingsanterior to the time when mankind have become capable of being im-proved by free and equal discussion. Until then, there is nothing forthem but implicit obedience to an Akbar or a Charlemagne, if they areso fortunate as to find one. But as soon as mankind have attained thecapacity of being guided to their own improvement by conviction orpersuasion (a period long since reached in all nations with whom weneed here concern ourselves), compulsion, either in the direct form or inthat of pains and penalties for non-compliance, is no longer admissibleas a means to their own good, and justifiable only for the security ofothers. It is proper to state that I forego any advantage which could be derived to my argument from the idea of abstract right, as a thing inde-pendent of utility. I regard utility as the ultimate appeal on all ethicalquestions; but it must be utility in the largest sense, grounded on thepermanent interests of a man as a progressive being. Those interests, Icontend, authorise the subjection of individual spontaneity to externalcontrol, only in respect to those actions of each, which concern the in-terest of other people. If any one does an act hurtful to others, there is aprima facie case for punishing him, by law, or, where legal penalties arenot safely applicable, by general disapprobation. There are also manypositive acts for the benefit of others, which he may rightfully be com-pelled to perform; such as to give evidence in a court of justice; to bearhis fair share in the common defence, or in any other joint work neces-sary to the interest of the society of which he enjoys the protection; andto perform certain acts of individual beneficence, such as saving a fel-On Liberty/15 low creature's life, or interposing to protect the defenceless against ill- usage, things which whenever it is obviously a man's duty to do, he mayrightfully be made responsible to society for not doing. A person maycause evil to others not only by his actions but by his inaction, and ineither case he is justly accountable to them for the injury. The lattercase, it is true, requires a much more cautious exercise of compulsionthan the former. To make any one answerable for doing evil to others isthe rule; to make him answerable for not preventing evil is, compara-tively speaking, the exception. Yet there are many cases clear enoughand grave enough to justify that exception. In all things which regardthe external relations of the individual, he is de jure amenable to thosewhose interests are concerned, and, if need be, to society as their protec-tor. There are often good reasons for not holding him to the responsibil-ity; but these reasons must arise from the special expediencies of thecase: either because it is a kind of case in which he is on the whole likelyto act better, when left to his own discretion, than when controlled inany way in which society have it in their power to control him; or be-cause the attempt to exercise control would produce other evils, greaterthan those which it would prevent. When such reasons as these precludethe enforcement of responsibility, the conscience of the agent himselfshould step into the vacant judgment seat, and protect those interests ofothers which have no external protection; judging himself all the morerigidly, because the case does not admit of his being made accountableto the judgment of his fellow creatures. But there is a sphere of action in which society, as distinguished from the individual, has, if any, only an indirect interest; comprehend-ing all that portion of a person's life and conduct which affects onlyhimself, or if it also affects others, only with their free, voluntary, andundeceived consent and participation. When I say only himself, I meandirectly, and in the first instance; for whatever affects himself, may af-fect others through himself; and the objection which may be groundedon this contingency, will receive consideration in the sequel. This, then,is the appropriate region of human liberty. It comprises, first, the in-ward domain of consciousness; demanding liberty of conscience in themost comprehensive sense; liberty of thought and feeling; absolute free-dom of opinion and sentiment on all subjects, practical or speculative,scientific, moral, or theological. The liberty of expressing and publish-ing opinions may seem to fall under a different principle, since it be-longs to that part of the conduct of an individual which concerns other16/John Stuart Mill people; but, being almost of as much importance as the liberty of thought itself, and resting in great part on the same reasons, is practically in-separable from it. Secondly, the principle requires liberty of tastes andpursuits; of framing the plan of our life to suit our own character; ofdoing as we like, subject to such consequences as may follow: withoutimpediment from our fellow creatures, so long as what we do does notharm them, even though they should think our conduct foolish, per-verse, or wrong. Thirdly, from this liberty of each individual, followsthe liberty, within the same limits, of combination among individuals;freedom to unite, for any purpose not involving harm to others: the per-sons combining being supposed to be of full age, and not forced ordeceived. No society in which these liberties are not, on the whole, respected, is free, whatever may be its form of government; and none is completelyfree in which they do not exist absolute and unqualified. The only free-dom which deserves the name, is that of pursuing our own good in ourown way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs, orimpede their efforts to obtain it. Each is the proper guardian of his ownhealth, whether bodily, or mental and spiritual. Mankind are greatergainers by suffering each other to live as seems good to themselves, thanby compelling each to live as seems good to the rest. Though this doctrine is anything but new, and, to some persons, may have the air of a truism, there is no doctrine which stands moredirectly opposed to the general tendency of existing opinion and prac-tice. Society has expended fully as much effort in the attempt (accord-ing to its lights) to compel people to conform to its notions of personalas of social excellence. The ancient commonwealths thought themselvesentitled to practise, and the ancient philosophers countenanced, the regu-lation of every part of private conduct by public authority, on the groundthat the State had a deep interest in the whole bodily and mental disci-pline of every one of its citizens; a mode of thinking which may havebeen admissible in small republics surrounded by powerful enemies, inconstant peril of being subverted by foreign attack or internal commo-tion, and to which even a short interval of relaxed energy and self-com-mand might so easily be fatal that they could not afford to wait for thesalutary permanent effects of freedom. In the modern world, the greatersize of political communities, and, above all, the separation betweenspiritual and temporal authority (which placed the direction of men'sconsciences in other hands than those which controlled their worldlyOn Liberty/17 affairs), prevented so great an interference by law in the details of pri- vate life; but the engines of moral repression have been wielded morestrenuously against divergence from the reigning opinion in self-regard-ing, than even in social matters; religion, the most powerful of the ele-ments which have entered into the formation of moral feeling, havingalmost always been governed either by the ambition of a hierarchy, seek-ing control over every department of human conduct, or by the spirit ofPuritanism. And some of those modern reformers who have placed them-selves in strongest opposition to the religions of the past, have beennoway behind either churches or sects in their assertion of the right ofspiritual domination: M. Comte, in particular, whose social system, asunfolded in his Syst\u00e8me de Politique Positive , aims at establishing (though by moral more than by legal appliances) a despotism of societyover the individual, surpassing anything contemplated in the politicalideal of the most rigid disciplinarian among the ancient philosophers. Apart from the peculiar tenets of individual thinkers, there is also in the world at large an increasing inclination to stretch unduly the powersof society over the individual, both by the force of opinion and even bythat of legislation; and as the tendency of all the changes taking place inthe world is to strengthen society, and diminish the power of the indi-vidual, this encroachment is not one of the evils which tend spontane-ously to disappear, but, on the contrary, to grow more and more formi-dable. The disposition of mankind, whether as rulers or as fellow-citi-zens, to impose their own opinions and inclinations as a rule of conducton others, is so energetically supported by some of the best and by someof the worst feelings incident to human nature, that it is hardly ever keptunder restraint by anything but want of power; and as the power is notdeclining, but growing, unless a strong barrier of moral conviction canbe raised against the mischief, we must expect, in the present circum-stances of the world, to see it increase. It will be convenient for the argument, if, instead of at once entering upon the general thesis, we confine ourselves in the first instance to asingle branch of it, on which the principle here stated is, if not fully, yetto a certain point, recognised by the current opinions. This one branch isthe Liberty of Thought: from which it is impossible to separate the cog-nate liberty of speaking and of writing. Although these liberties, to someconsiderable amount, form part of the political morality of all countrieswhich profess religious toleration and free institutions, the grounds, bothphilosophical and practical, on which they rest, are perhaps not so fa-18/John Stuart Mill miliar to the general mind, nor so thoroughly appreciated by many even of the leaders of opinion, as might have been expected. Those grounds,when rightly understood, are of much wider application than to only onedivision of the subject, and a thorough consideration of this part of thequestion will be found the best introduction to the remainder. Those towhom nothing which I am about to say will be new, may therefore, Ihope, excuse me, if on a subject which for now three centuries has beenso often discussed, I venture on one discussion more. Chapter 2.Of the Liberty of Thought and Discussion. The time, it is to be hoped, is gone by, when any defence would benecessary of the \"liberty of the press\" as one of the securities againstcorrupt or tyrannical government. No argument, we may suppose, cannow be needed, against permitting a legislature or an executive, notidentified in interest with the people, to prescribe opinions to them, anddetermine what doctrines or what arguments they shall be allowed tohear. This aspect of the question, besides, has been so of and so trium-phantly enforced by preceding writers, that it needs not be speciallyinsisted on in this place. Though the law of England, on the subject ofthe press, is as servile to this day as it was in the time of the Tudors,there is little danger of its being actually put in force against politicaldiscussion, except during some temporary panic, when fear of insurrec-tion drives ministers and judges from their propriety; 1 and, speaking generally, it is not, in constitutional countries, to be apprehended, thatthe government, whether completely responsible to the people or not,will often attempt to control the expression of opinion, except when indoing so it makes itself the organ of the general intolerance of the pub-lic. Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one withthe people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless inagreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the rightof the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by theirgovernment. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government hasno more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, whenexerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition toit. If all mankind minus one were of one opinion, and only one personwere of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified insilencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justi-fied in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of noOn Liberty/19 value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the in-jury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many. But the peculiarevil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing thehuman race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dis-sent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion isright, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth:if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer percep-tion and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error. It is necessary to consider separately these two hypotheses, each of which has a distinct branch of the argument corresponding to it. We cannever be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a falseopinion; and if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still. First: the opinion which it is attempted to suppress by authority may possibly be true. Those who desire to suppress it, of course deny itstruth; but they are not infallible. They have no authority to decide thequestion for all mankind, and exclude every other person from the meansof judging. To refuse a hearing to an opinion, because they are sure thatit is false, is to assume that their certainty is the same thing as absolutecertainty. All silencing of discussion is an assumption of infallibility. Itscondemnation may be allowed to rest on this common argument, not theworse for being common. Unfortunately for the good sense of mankind, the fact of their falli- bility is far from carrying the weight in their practical judgment whichis always allowed to it in theory; for while every one well knows himselfto be fallible, few think it necessary to take any precautions againsttheir own fallibility, or admit the supposition that any opinion, of whichthey feel very certain, may be one of the examples of the error to whichthey acknowledge themselves to be liable. Absolute princes, or otherswho are accustomed to unlimited deference, usually feel this completeconfidence in their own opinions on nearly all subjects. People morehappily situated, who sometimes hear their opinions disputed, and arenot wholly unused to be set right when they are wrong, place the sameunbounded reliance only on such of their opinions as are shared by allwho surround them, or to whom they habitually defer; for in proportionto a man's want of confidence in his own solitary judgment, does heusually repose, with implicit trust, on the infallibility of \"the world\" ingeneral. And the world, to each individual, means the part of it withwhich he comes in contact; his party, his sect, his church, his class of20/John Stuart Mill society; the man may be called, by comparison, almost liberal and large- minded to whom it means anything so comprehensive as his own coun-try or his own age. Nor is his faith in this collective authority at allshaken by his being aware that other ages, countries, sects, churches,classes, and parties have thought, and even now think, the exact reverse.He devolves upon his own world the responsibility of being in the rightagainst the dissentient worlds of other people; and it never troubles himthat mere accident has decided which of these numerous worlds is theobject of his reliance, and that the same causes which make him a Church-man in London, would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian inPekin. Yet it is as evident in itself, as any amount of argument can makeit, that ages are no more infallible than individuals; every age havingheld many opinions which subsequent ages have deemed not only falsebut absurd; and it is as certain that many opinions now general will berejected by future ages, as it is that many, once general, are rejected bythe present. The objection likely to be made to this argument would probably take some such form as the following. There is no greater assumption ofinfallibility in forbidding the propagation of error, than in any otherthing which is done by public authority on its own judgment and respon-sibility. Judgment is given to men that they may use it. Because it maybe used erroneously, are men to be told that they ought not to use it atall? To prohibit what they think pernicious, is not claiming exemptionfrom error, but fulfilling the duty incumbent on them, although fallible,of acting on their conscientious conviction. If we were never to act onour opinions, because those opinions may be wrong, we should leave allour interests uncared for, and all our duties unperformed. An objectionwhich applies to all conduct can be no valid objection to any conduct inparticular. It is the duty of governments, and of individuals, to form thetruest opinions they can; to form them carefully, and never impose themupon others unless they are quite sure of being right. But when they aresure (such reasoners may say), it is not conscientiousness but cowardiceto shrink from acting on their opinions, and allow doctrines which theyhonestly think dangerous to the welfare of mankind, either in this life orin another, to be scattered abroad without restraint, because other people,in less enlightened times, have persecuted opinions now believed to betrue. Let us take care, it may be said, not to make the same mistake: butgovernments and nations have made mistakes in other things, which arenot denied to be fit subjects for the exercise of authority: they have laidOn Liberty/21 on bad taxes, made unjust wars. Ought we therefore to lay on no taxes, and, under whatever provocation, make no wars? Men, and govern-ments, must act to the best of their ability. There is no such thing asabsolute certainty, but there is assurance sufficient for the purposes ofhuman life. We may, and must, assume our opinion to be true for theguidance of our own conduct: and it is assuming no more when weforbid bad men to pervert society by the propagation of opinions whichwe regard as false and pernicious. I answer, that it is assuming very much more. There is the greatest difference between presuming an opinion to be true, because, with everyopportunity for contesting it, it has not been refuted, and assuming itstruth for the purpose of not permitting its refutation. Complete liberty ofcontradicting and disproving our opinion is the very condition whichjustifies us in assuming its truth for purposes of action; and on no otherterms can a being with human faculties have any rational assurance ofbeing right. When we consider either the history of opinion, or the ordinary conduct of human life, to what is it to be ascribed that the one and theother are no worse than they are? Not certainly to the inherent force ofthe human understanding; for, on any matter not self-evident, there areninety-nine persons totally incapable of judging of it for one who iscapable; and the capacity of the hundredth person is only comparative;for the majority of the eminent men of every past generation held manyopinions now known to be erroneous, and did or approved numerousthings which no one will now justify. Why is it, then, that there is on thewhole a preponderance among mankind of rational opinions and ratio-nal conduct? If there really is this preponderance\u2014which there must beunless human affairs are, and have always been, in an almost desperatestate\u2014it is owing to a quality of the human mind, the source of every-thing respectable in man either as an intellectual or as a moral being,namely, that his errors are corrigible. He is capable of rectifying hismistakes, by discussion and experience. Not by experience alone. Theremust be discussion, to show how experience is to be interpreted. Wrongopinions and practices gradually yield to fact and argument; but factsand arguments, to produce any effect on the mind, must be broughtbefore it. Very few facts are able to tell their own story, without com-ments to bring out their meaning. The whole strength and value, then, ofhuman judgment, depending on the one property, that it can be set rightwhen it is wrong, reliance can be placed on it only when the means of22/John Stuart Mill setting it right are kept constantly at hand. In the case of any person whose judgment is really deserving of confidence, how has it becomeso? Because he has kept his mind open to criticism of his opinions andconduct. Because it has been his practice to listen to all that could besaid against him; to profit by as much of it as was just, and expound tohimself, and upon occasion to others, the fallacy of what was fallacious.Because he has felt, that the only way in which a human being can makesome approach to knowing the whole of a subject, is by hearing whatcan be said about it by persons of every variety of opinion, and studyingall modes in which it can be looked at by every character of mind. Nowise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but this; nor is it in thenature of human intellect to become wise in any other manner. The steadyhabit of correcting and completing his own opinion by collating it withthose of others, so far from causing doubt and hesitation in carrying itinto practice, is the only stable foundation for a just reliance on it: for,being cognisant of all that can, at least obviously, be said against him,and having taken up his position against all gainsayers\u2014knowing thathe has sought for objections and difficulties, instead of avoiding them,and has shut out no light which can be thrown upon the subject fromany quarter\u2014he has a right to think his judgment better than that of anyperson, or any multitude, who have not gone through a similar process. It is not too much to require that what the wisest of mankind, those who are best entitled to trust their own judgment, find necessary to war-rant their relying on it, should be submitted to by that miscellaneouscollection of a few wise and many foolish individuals, called the public.The most intolerant of churches, the Roman Catholic Church, even atthe canonisation of a saint, admits, and listens patiently to, a \"devil'sadvocate.\" The holiest of men, it appears, cannot be admitted to posthu-mous honours, until all that the devil could say against him is knownand weighed. If even the Newtonian philosophy were not permitted tobe questioned, mankind could not feel as complete assurance of its truthas they now do. The beliefs which we have most warrant for have nosafeguard to rest on, but a standing invitation to the whole world toprove them unfounded. If the challenge is not accepted, or is acceptedand the attempt fails, we are far enough from certainty still; but we havedone the best that the existing state of human reason admits of; we haveneglected nothing that could give the truth a chance of reaching us: if thelists are kept open, we may hope that if there be a better truth, it will befound when the human mind is capable of receiving it; and in the mean-On Liberty/23 time we may rely on having attained such approach to truth as is pos- sible in our own day. This is the amount of certainty attainable by afallible being, and this the sole way of attaining it. Strange it is, that men should admit the validity of the arguments for free discussion, but object to their being \"pushed to an extreme\"; notseeing that unless the reasons are good for an extreme case, they are notgood for any case. Strange that they should imagine that they are notassuming infallibility, when they acknowledge that there should be freediscussion on all subjects which can possibly be doubtful, but think thatsome particular principle or doctrine should be forbidden to be ques-tioned because it is so certain, that is, because they are certain that it iscertain. To call any proposition certain, while there is any one who woulddeny its certainty if permitted, but who is not permitted, is to assumethat we ourselves, and those who agree with us, are the judges of cer-tainty, and judges without hearing the other side. In the present age\u2014which has been described as \"destitute of faith, but terrified at scepticism\"\u2014in which people feel sure, not so much thattheir opinions are true, as that they should not know what to do withoutthem\u2014the claims of an opinion to be protected from public attack arerested not so much on its truth, as on its importance to society. Thereare, it is alleged, certain beliefs so useful, not to say indispensable, towell-being that it is as much the duty of governments to uphold thosebeliefs, as to protect any other of the interests of society. In a case ofsuch necessity, and so directly in the line of their duty, something lessthan infallibility may, it is maintained, warrant, and even bind, govern-ments to act on their own opinion, confirmed by the general opinion ofmankind. It is also often argued, and still oftener thought, that none butbad men would desire to weaken these salutary beliefs; and there can benothing wrong, it is thought, in restraining bad men, and prohibitingwhat only such men would wish to practise. This mode of thinking makesthe justification of restraints on discussion not a question of the truth ofdoctrines, but of their usefulness; and flatters itself by that means toescape the responsibility of claiming to be an infallible judge of opin-ions. But those who thus satisfy themselves, do not perceive that the as- sumption of infallibility is merely shifted from one point to another. Theusefulness of an opinion is itself matter of opinion: as disputable, asopen to discussion, and requiring discussion as much as the opinionitself. There is the same need of an infallible judge of opinions to decide24/John Stuart Mill an opinion to be noxious, as to decide it to be false, unless the opinion condemned has full opportunity of defending itself. And it will not do tosay that the heretic may be allowed to maintain the utility or harmless-ness of his opinion, though forbidden to maintain its truth. The truth ofan opinion is part of its utility. If we would know whether or not it isdesirable that a proposition should be believed, is it possible to excludethe consideration of whether or not it is true? In the opinion, not of badmen, but of the best men, no belief which is contrary to truth can bereally useful: and can you prevent such men from urging that plea, whenthey are charged with culpability for denying some doctrine which theyare told is useful, but which they believe to be false? Those who are onthe side of received opinions never fail to take all possible advantage ofthis plea; you do not find them handling the question of utility as if itcould be completely abstracted from that of truth: on the contrary, it is,above all, because their doctrine is \"the truth,\" that the knowledge or thebelief of it is held to be so indispensable. There can be no fair discussionof the question of usefulness when an argument so vital may be em-ployed on one side, but not on the other. And in point of fact, when lawor public feeling do not permit the truth of an opinion to be disputed,they are just as little tolerant of a denial of its usefulness. The utmostthey allow is an extenuation of its absolute necessity, or of the positiveguilt of rejecting it. In order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to opinions because we, in our own judgment, have condemned them, itwill be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and Ichoose, by preference, the cases which are least favourable to me\u2014inwhich the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score oftruth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest. Let the opinionsimpugned be the belief in a God and in a future state, or any of thecommonly received doctrines of morality. To fight the battle on suchground gives a great advantage to an unfair antagonist; since he will besure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say it inter-nally), Are these the doctrines which you do not deem sufficiently cer-tain to be taken under the protection of law? Is the belief in a God one ofthe opinions to feel sure of which you hold to be assuming infallibility?But I must be permitted to observe, that it is not the feeling sure of adoctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. Itis the undertaking to decide that question for others, without allowingthem to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce andOn Liberty/25 reprobate this pretension not the less, if put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions. However positive any one's persuasion may be, notonly of the falsity but of the pernicious consequences\u2014not only of thepernicious consequences, but (to adopt expressions which I altogethercondemn) the immorality and impiety of an opinion; yet if, in pursuanceof that private judgment, though backed by the public judgment of hiscountry or his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from being heardin its defence, he assumes infallibility. And so far from the assumptionbeing less objectionable or less dangerous because the opinion is calledimmoral or impious, this is the case of all others in which it is mostfatal. These are exactly the occasions on which the men of one genera-tion commit those dreadful mistakes which excite the astonishment andhorror of posterity. It is among such that we find the instances memo-rable in history, when the arm of the law has been employed to root outthe best men and the noblest doctrines; with deplorable success as to themen, though some of the doctrines have survived to be (as if in mock-ery) invoked in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissentfrom them, or from their received interpretation. Mankind can hardly be too often reminded, that there was once a man named Socrates, between whom and the legal authorities and pub-lic opinion of his time there took place a memorable collision. Born inan age and country abounding in individual greatness, this man hasbeen handed down to us by those who best knew both him and the age,as the most virtuous man in it; while we know him as the head andprototype of all subsequent teachers of virtue, the source equally of thelofty inspiration of Plato and the judicious utilitarianism of Aristotle, \"imastri di color che sanno,\" the two headsprings of ethical as of all otherphilosophy. This acknowledged master of all the eminent thinkers whohave since lived\u2014whose fame, still growing after more than two thou-sand years, all but outweighs the whole remainder of the names whichmake his native city illustrious\u2014was put to death by his countrymen,after a judicial conviction, for impiety and immorality. Impiety, in deny-ing the gods recognised by the State; indeed his accuser asserted (see theApologia) that he believed in no gods at all. Immorality, in being, by hisdoctrines and instructions, a \"corruptor of youth.\" Of these charges thetribunal, there is every ground for believing, honestly found him guilty,and condemned the man who probably of all then born had deservedbest of mankind to be put to death as a criminal. To pass from this to the only other instance of judicial iniquity, the26/John Stuart Mill mention of which, after the condemnation of Socrates, would not be an anti-climax: the event which took place on Calvary rather more thaneighteen hundred years ago. The man who left on the memory of thosewho witnessed his life and conversation such an impression of his moralgrandeur that eighteen subsequent centuries have done homage to himas the Almighty in person, was ignominiously put to death, as what? Asa blasphemer. Men did not merely mistake their benefactor; they mis-took him for the exact contrary of what he was, and treated him as thatprodigy of impiety which they themselves are now held to be for theirtreatment of him. The feelings with which mankind now regard theselamentable transactions, especially the later of the two, render them ex-tremely unjust in their judgment of the unhappy actors. These were, toall appearance, not bad men\u2014not worse than men commonly are, butrather the contrary; men who possessed in a full, or somewhat morethan a full measure, the religious, moral, and patriotic feelings of theirtime and people: the very kind of men who, in all times, our own in-cluded, have every chance of passing through life blameless and re-spected. The high-priest who rent his garments when the words werepronounced, which, according to all the ideas of his country, constitutedthe blackest guilt, was in all probability quite as sincere in his horrorand indignation as the generality of respectable and pious men now arein the religious and moral sentiments they profess; and most of thosewho now shudder at his conduct, if they had lived in his time, and beenborn Jews, would have acted precisely as he did. Orthodox Christianswho are tempted to think that those who stoned to death the first martyrsmust have been worse men than they themselves are, ought to rememberthat one of those persecutors was Saint Paul. Let us add one more example, the most striking of all, if the impres- siveness of an error is measured by the wisdom and virtue of him whofalls into it. If ever any one, possessed of power, had grounds for think-ing himself the best and most enlightened among his contemporaries, itwas the Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Absolute monarch of the wholecivilised world, he preserved through life not only the most unblemishedjustice, but what was less to be expected from his Stoical breeding, thetenderest heart. The few failings which are attributed to him were all onthe side of indulgence: while his writings, the highest ethical product ofthe ancient mind, differ scarcely perceptibly, if they differ at all, fromthe most characteristic teachings of Christ. This man, a better Christianin all but the dogmatic sense of the word than almost any of the ostensi-On Liberty/27 bly Christian sovereigns who have since reigned, persecuted Christian- ity. Placed at the summit of all the previous attainments of humanity,with an open, unfettered intellect, and a character which led him ofhimself to embody in his moral writings the Christian ideal, he yet failedto see that Christianity was to be a good and not an evil to the world,with his duties to which he was so deeply penetrated. Existing society heknew to be in a deplorable state. But such as it was, he saw, or thoughthe saw, that it was held together, and prevented from being worse, bybelief and reverence of the received divinities. As a ruler of mankind, hedeemed it his duty not to suffer society to fall in pieces; and saw nothow, if its existing ties were removed, any others could be formed whichcould again knit it together. The new religion openly aimed at dissolvingthese ties: unless, therefore, it was his duty to adopt that religion, itseemed to be his duty to put it down. Inasmuch then as the theology ofChristianity did not appear to him true or of divine origin; inasmuch asthis strange history of a crucified God was not credible to him, and asystem which purported to rest entirely upon a foundation to him sowholly unbelievable, could not be foreseen by him to be that renovatingagency which, after all abatements, it has in fact proved to be; the gen-tlest and most amiable of philosophers and rulers, under a solemn senseof duty, authorised the persecution of Christianity. To my mind this is one of the most tragical facts in all history. It is a bitter thought, how different a thing the Christianity of the world mighthave been, if the Christian faith had been adopted as the religion of theempire under the auspices of Marcus Aurelius instead of those ofConstantine. But it would be equally unjust to him and false to truth todeny, that no one plea which can be urged for punishing anti-Christianteaching was wanting to Marcus Aurelius for punishing, as he did, thepropagation of Christianity. No Christian more firmly believes that Athe-ism is false, and tends to the dissolution of society, than Marcus Aureliusbelieved the same things of Christianity; he who, of all men then living,might have been thought the most capable of appreciating it. Unless anyone who approves of punishment for the promulgation of opinions, flat-ters himself that he is a wiser and better man than Marcus Aurelius\u2014more deeply versed in the wisdom of his time, more elevated in his intel-lect above it\u2014more earnest in his search for truth, or more single-mindedin his devotion to it when found; let him abstain from that assumption ofthe joint infallibility of himself and the multitude, which the greatAntoninus made with so unfortunate a result.28/John Stuart Mill Aware of the impossibility of defending the use of punishment for restraining irreligious opinions by any argument which will not justifyMarcus Antoninus, the enemies of religious freedom, when hard pressed,occasionally accept this consequence, and say, with Dr. Johnson, thatthe persecutors of Christianity were in the right; that persecution is anordeal through which truth ought to pass, and always passes success-fully, legal penalties being, in the end, powerless against truth, thoughsometimes beneficially effective against mischievous errors. This is aform of the argument for religious intolerance sufficiently remarkablenot to be passed without notice. A theory which maintains that truth may justifiably be persecuted because persecution cannot possibly do it any harm, cannot be chargedwith being intentionally hostile to the reception of new truths; but wecannot commend the generosity of its dealing with the persons to whommankind are indebted for them. To discover to the world something whichdeeply concerns it, and of which it was previously ignorant; to prove toit that it had been mistaken on some vital point of temporal or spiritualinterest, is as important a service as a human being can render to hisfellow creatures, and in certain cases, as in those of the early Christiansand of the Reformers, those who think with Dr. Johnson believe it tohave been the most precious gift which could be bestowed on mankind.That the authors of such splendid benefits should be requited by martyr-dom; that their reward should be to be dealt with as the vilest of crimi-nals, is not, upon this theory, a deplorable error and misfortune, forwhich humanity should mourn in sackcloth and ashes, but the normaland justifiable state of things. The propounder of a new truth, accordingto this doctrine, should stand as stood, in the legislation of the Locrians,the proposer of a new law, with a halter round his neck, to be instantlytightened if the public assembly did not, on hearing his reasons, thenand there adopt his proposition. People who defend this mode of treat-ing benefactors cannot be supposed to set much value on the benefit;and I believe this view of the subject is mostly confined to the sort ofpersons who think that new truths may have been desirable once, butthat we have had enough of them now. But, indeed, the dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of those pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one anothertill they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes. His-tory teems with instances of truth put down by persecution. If not sup-pressed for ever, it may be thrown back for centuries. To speak only ofOn Liberty/29 religious opinions: the Reformation broke out at least twenty times be- fore Luther, and was put down. Arnold of Brescia was put down. FraDolcino was put down. Savonarola was put down. The Albigeois wereput down. The Vaudois were put down. The Lollards were put down.The Hussites were put down. Even after the era of Luther, whereverpersecution was persisted in, it was successful. In Spain, Italy, Flanders,the Austrian empire, Protestantism was rooted out; and, most likely,would have been so in England, had Queen Mary lived, or Queen Eliza-beth died. Persecution has always succeeded, save where the hereticswere too strong a party to be effectually persecuted. No reasonable per-son can doubt that Christianity might have been extirpated in the Ro-man Empire. It spread, and became predominant, because the persecu-tions were only occasional, lasting but a short time, and separated bylong intervals of almost undisturbed propagandism. It is a piece of idlesentimentality that truth, merely as truth, has any inherent power deniedto error of prevailing against the dungeon and the stake. Men are notmore zealous for truth than they often are for error, and a sufficientapplication of legal or even of social penalties will generally succeed instopping the propagation of either. The real advantage which truth hasconsists in this, that when an opinion is true, it may be extinguishedonce, twice, or many times, but in the course of ages there will generallybe found persons to rediscover it, until some one of its reappearancesfalls on a time when from favourable circumstances it escapes persecu-tion until it has made such head as to withstand all subsequent attemptsto suppress it. It will be said, that we do not now put to death the introducers of new opinions: we are not like our fathers who slew the prophets, weeven build sepulchres to them. It is true we no longer put heretics todeath; and the amount of penal infliction which modern feeling wouldprobably tolerate, even against the most obnoxious opinions, is not suf-ficient to extirpate them. But let us not flatter ourselves that we are yetfree from the stain even of legal persecution. Penalties for opinion, or atleast for its expression, still exist by law; and their enforcement is not,even in these times, so unexampled as to make it at all incredible thatthey may some day be revived in full force. In the year 1857, at thesummer assizes of the county of Cornwall, an unfortunate man, 2 said to be of unexceptionable conduct in all relations of life, was sentenced totwenty-one months' imprisonment, for uttering, and writing on a gate,some offensive words concerning Christianity. Within a month of the30/John Stuart Mill same time, at the Old Bailey, two persons, on two separate occasions,3 were rejected as jurymen, and one of them grossly insulted by the judge and by one of the counsel, because they honestly declared that they hadno theological belief; and a third, a foreigner, 4 for the same reason, was denied justice against a thief. This refusal of redress took place in virtue of the legal doctrine, that no person can be allowed to give evidence in a court of justice who doesnot profess belief in a God (any god is sufficient) and in a future state;which is equivalent to declaring such persons to be outlaws, excludedfrom the protection of the tribunals; who may not only be robbed orassaulted with impunity, if no one but themselves, or persons of similaropinions, be present, but any one else may be robbed or assaulted withimpunity, if the proof of the fact depends on their evidence. The as-sumption on which this is grounded is that the oath is worthless of aperson who does not believe in a future state; a proposition which beto-kens much ignorance of history in those who assent to it (since it ishistorically true that a large proportion of infidels in all ages have beenpersons of distinguished integrity and honour); and would be maintainedby no one who had the smallest conception how many of the persons ingreatest repute with the world, both for virtues and attainments, are wellknown, at least to their intimates, to be unbelievers. The rule, besides, issuicidal, and cuts away its own foundation. Under pretence that atheistsmust be liars, it admits the testimony of all atheists who are willing tolie, and rejects only those who brave the obloquy of publicly confessinga detested creed rather than affirm a falsehood. A rule thus self-con-victed of absurdity so far as regards its professed purpose, can be keptin force only as a badge of hatred, a relic of persecution; a persecution,too, having the peculiarity that the qualification for undergoing it is thebeing clearly proved not to deserve it. The rule, and the theory it im-plies, are hardly less insulting to believers than to infidels. For if he whodoes not believe in a future state necessarily lies, it follows that theywho do believe are only prevented from lying, if prevented they are, bythe fear of hell. We will not do the authors and abettors of the rule theinjury of supposing that the conception which they have formed of Chris-tian virtue is drawn from their own consciousness. These, indeed, are but rags and remnants of persecution, and may be thought to be not so much an indication of the wish to persecute, asan example of that very frequent infirmity of English minds, which makesthem take a preposterous pleasure in the assertion of a bad principle,On Liberty/31 when they are no longer bad enough to desire to carry it really into practice. But unhappily there is no security in the state of the publicmind that the suspension of worse forms of legal persecution, which haslasted for about the space of a generation, will continue. In this age thequiet surface of routine is as often ruffled by attempts to resuscitate pastevils, as to introduce new benefits. What is boasted of at the presenttime as the revival of religion, is always, in narrow and uncultivatedminds, at least as much the revival of bigotry; and where there is thestrong permanent leaven of intolerance in the feelings of a people, whichat all times abides in the middle classes of this country, it needs but littleto provoke them into actively persecuting those whom they have neverceased to think proper objects of persecution. 5 For it is this\u2014it is the opinions men entertain, and the feelings they cherish, respecting thosewho disown the beliefs they deem important, which makes this countrynot a place of mental freedom. For a long time past, the chief mischief of the legal penalties is that they strengthen the social stigma. It is that stigma which is really effec-tive, and so effective is it, that the profession of opinions which areunder the ban of society is much less common in England than is, inmany other countries, the avowal of those which incur risk of judicialpunishment. In respect to all persons but those whose pecuniary cir-cumstances make them independent of the good will of other people,opinion, on this subject, is as efficacious as law; men might as well beimprisoned, as excluded from the means of earning their bread. Thosewhose bread is already secured, and who desire no favours from men inpower, or from bodies of men, or from the public, have nothing to fearfrom the open avowal of any opinions, but to be ill-thought of and ill-spoken of, and this it ought not to require a very heroic mould to enablethem to bear. There is no room for any appeal ad misericordiam in behalf of such persons. But though we do not now inflict so much evilon those who think differently from us as it was formerly our custom todo, it may be that we do ourselves as much evil as ever by our treatmentof them. Socrates was put to death, but the Socratic philosophy rose likethe sun in heaven, and spread its illumination over the whole intellectualfirmament. Christians were cast to the lions, but the Christian churchgrew up a stately and spreading tree, overtopping the older and lessvigorous growths, and stifling them by its shade. Our merely socialintolerance kills no one, roots out no opinions, but induces men to dis-guise them, or to abstain from any active effort for their diffusion. With32/John Stuart Mill us, heretical opinions do not perceptibly gain, or even lose, ground in each decade or generation; they never blaze out far and wide, but con-tinue to smoulder in the narrow circles of thinking and studious personsamong whom they originate, without ever lighting up the general affairsof mankind with either a true or a deceptive light. And thus is kept up a state of things very satisfactory to some minds, because, without the unpleasant process of fining or imprisoning any-body, it maintains all prevailing opinions outwardly undisturbed, whileit does not absolutely interdict the exercise of reason by dissentientsafflicted with the malady of thought. A convenient plan for having peacein the intellectual world, and keeping all things going on therein verymuch as they do already. But the price paid for this sort of intellectualpacification is the sacrifice of the entire moral courage of the humanmind. A state of things in which a large portion of the most active andinquiring intellects find it advisable to keep the general principles andgrounds of their convictions within their own breasts, and attempt, inwhat they address to the public, to fit as much as they can of their ownconclusions to premises which they have internally renounced, cannotsend forth the open, fearless characters, and logical, consistent intel-lects who once adorned the thinking world. The sort of men who can belooked for under it, are either mere conformers to commonplace, ortime-servers for truth, whose arguments on all great subjects are meantfor their hearers, and are not those which have convinced themselves.Those who avoid this alternative, do so by narrowing their thoughts andinterests to things which can be spoken of without venturing within theregion of principles, that is, to small practical matters, which wouldcome right of themselves, if but the minds of mankind were strength-ened and enlarged, and which will never be made effectually right untilthen: while that which would strengthen and enlarge men's minds, freeand daring speculation on the highest subjects, is abandoned. Those in whose eyes this reticence on the part of heretics is no evil should consider, in the first place, that in consequence of it there is neverany fair and thorough discussion of heretical opinions; and that such ofthem as could not stand such a discussion, though they may be pre-vented from spreading, do not disappear. But it is not the minds of her-etics that are deteriorated most by the ban placed on all inquiry whichdoes not end in the orthodox conclusions. The greatest harm done is tothose who are not heretics, and whose whole mental development iscramped, and their reason cowed, by the fear of heresy. Who can com-On Liberty/33 pute what the world loses in the multitude of promising intellects com- bined with timid characters, who dare not follow out any bold, vigor-ous, independent train of thought, lest it should land them in somethingwhich would admit of being considered irreligious or immoral? Amongthem we may occasionally see some man of deep conscientiousness, andsubtle and refined understanding, who spends a life in sophisticatingwith an intellect which he cannot silence, and exhausts the resources ofingenuity in attempting to reconcile the promptings of his conscienceand reason with orthodoxy, which yet he does not, perhaps, to the endsucceed in doing. No one can be a great thinker who does not recognise, that as a thinker it is his first duty to follow his intellect to whatever conclusionsit may lead. Truth gains more even by the errors of one who, with duestudy and preparation, thinks for himself, than by the true opinions ofthose who only hold them because they do not suffer themselves to think.Not that it is solely, or chiefly, to form great thinkers, that freedom ofthinking is required. On the contrary, it is as much and even more indis-pensable to enable average human beings to attain the mental staturewhich they are capable of. There have been, and may again be, greatindividual thinkers in a general atmosphere of mental slavery. But therenever has been, nor ever will be, in that atmosphere an intellectuallyactive people. Where any people has made a temporary approach tosuch a character, it has been because the dread of heterodox speculationwas for a time suspended. Where there is a tacit convention that prin-ciples are not to be disputed; where the discussion of the greatest ques-tions which can occupy humanity is considered to be closed, we cannothope to find that generally high scale of mental activity which has madesome periods of history so remarkable. Never when controversy avoidedthe subjects which are large and important enough to kindle enthusiasm,was the mind of a people stirred up from its foundations, and the im-pulse given which raised even persons of the most ordinary intellect tosomething of the dignity of thinking beings. Of such we have had anexample in the condition of Europe during the times immediately fol-lowing the Reformation; another, though limited to the Continent and toa more cultivated class, in the speculative movement of the latter half ofthe eighteenth century; and a third, of still briefer duration, in the intel-lectual fermentation of Germany during the Goethian and Fichtean pe-riod. These periods differed widely in the particular opinions which theydeveloped; but were alike in this, that during all three the yoke of au-34/John Stuart Mill thority was broken. In each, an old mental despotism had been thrown off, and no new one had yet taken its place. The impulse given at thesethree periods has made Europe what it now is. Every single improve-ment which has taken place either in the human mind or in institutions,may be traced distinctly to one or other of them. Appearances have forsome time indicated that all three impulses are well nigh spent; and wecan expect no fresh start until we again assert our mental freedom. Let us now pass to the second division of the argument, and dis- missing the supposition that any of the received opinions may be false,let us assume them to be true, and examine into the worth of the mannerin which they are likely to be held, when their truth is not freely andopenly canvassed. However unwillingly a person who has a strong opin-ion may admit the possibility that his opinion may be false, he ought tobe moved by the consideration that, however true it may be, if it is notfully, frequently, and fearlessly discussed, it will be held as a dead dogma,not a living truth. There is a class of persons (happily not quite so numerous as for- merly) who think it enough if a person assents undoubtingly to whatthey think true, though he has no knowledge whatever of the grounds ofthe opinion, and could not make a tenable defence of it against the mostsuperficial objections. Such persons, if they can once get their creedtaught from authority, naturally think that no good, and some harm,comes of its being allowed to be questioned. Where their influence pre-vails, they make it nearly impossible for the received opinion to be re-jected wisely and considerately, though it may still be rejected rashlyand ignorantly; for to shut out discussion entirely is seldom possible,and when it once gets in, beliefs not grounded on conviction are apt togive way before the slightest semblance of an argument. Waiving, how-ever, this possibility\u2014assuming that the true opinion abides in the mind,but abides as a prejudice, a belief independent of, and proof against,argument\u2014this is not the way in which truth ought to be held by arational being. This is not knowing the truth. Truth, thus held, is but onesuperstition the more, accidentally clinging to the words which enunci-ate a truth. If the intellect and judgment of mankind ought to be cultivated, a thing which Protestants at least do not deny, on what can these facultiesbe more appropriately exercised by any one, than on the things whichconcern him so much that it is considered necessary for him to holdopinions on them? If the cultivation of the understanding consists in oneOn Liberty/35 thing more than in another, it is surely in learning the grounds of one's own opinions. Whatever people believe, on subjects on which it is of thefirst importance to believe rightly, they ought to be able to defend againstat least the common objections. But, some one may say, \"Let them betaught the grounds of their opinions. It does not follow that opinionsmust be merely parroted because they are never heard controverted.Persons who learn geometry do not simply commit the theorems tomemory, but understand and learn likewise the demonstrations; and itwould be absurd to say that they remain ignorant of the grounds ofgeometrical truths, because they never hear any one deny, and attemptto disprove them.\" Undoubtedly: and such teaching suffices on a subjectlike mathematics, where there is nothing at all to be said on the wrongside of the question. The peculiarity of the evidence of mathematicaltruths is that all the argument is on one side. There are no objections,and no answers to objections. But on every subject on which differenceof opinion is possible, the truth depends on a balance to be struck be-tween two sets of conflicting reasons. Even in natural philosophy, thereis always some other explanation possible of the same facts; some geo-centric theory instead of heliocentric, some phlogiston instead of oxy-gen; and it has to be shown why that other theory cannot be the true one:and until this is shown, and until we know how it is shown, we do notunderstand the grounds of our opinion. But when we turn to subjects infinitely more complicated, to mor- als, religion, politics, social relations, and the business of life, three-fourths of the arguments for every disputed opinion consist in dispellingthe appearances which favour some opinion different from it. The great-est orator, save one, of antiquity, has left it on record that he alwaysstudied his adversary's case with as great, if not still greater, intensitythan even his own. What Cicero practised as the means of forensic suc-cess requires to be imitated by all who study any subject in order toarrive at the truth. He who knows only his own side of the case, knowslittle of that. His reasons may be good, and no one may have been ableto refute them. But if he is equally unable to refute the reasons on theopposite side; if he does not so much as know what they are, he has noground for preferring either opinion. The rational position for him wouldbe suspension of judgment, and unless he contents himself with that, heis either led by authority, or adopts, like the generality of the world, theside to which he feels most inclination. Nor is it enough that he shouldhear the arguments of adversaries from his own teachers, presented as36/John Stuart Mill they state them, and accompanied by what they offer as refutations. That is not the way to do justice to the arguments, or bring them intoreal contact with his own mind. He must be able to hear them frompersons who actually believe them; who defend them in earnest, and dotheir very utmost for them. He must know them in their most plausibleand persuasive form; he must feel the whole force of the difficulty whichthe true view of the subject has to encounter and dispose of; else he willnever really possess himself of the portion of truth which meets andremoves that difficulty. Ninety-nine in a hundred of what are called educated men are in this condition; even of those who can argue fluently for their opinions. Theirconclusion may be true, but it might be false for anything they know:they have never thrown themselves into the mental position of thosewho think differently from them, and considered what such persons mayhave to say; and consequently they do not, in any proper sense of theword, know the doctrine which they themselves profess. They do notknow those parts of it which explain and justify the remainder; the con-siderations which show that a fact which seemingly conflicts with an-other is reconcilable with it, or that, of two apparently strong reasons,one and not the other ought to be preferred. All that part of the truthwhich turns the scale, and decides the judgment of a completely in-formed mind, they are strangers to; nor is it ever really known, but tothose who have attended equally and impartially to both sides, and en-deavoured to see the reasons of both in the strongest light. So essentialis this discipline to a real understanding of moral and human subjects,that if opponents of all important truths do not exist, it is indispensableto imagine them, and supply them with the strongest arguments whichthe most skilful devil's advocate can conjure up. To abate the force of these considerations, an enemy of free discus- sion may be supposed to say, that there is no necessity for mankind ingeneral to know and understand all that can be said against or for theiropinions by philosophers and theologians. That it is not needful for com-mon men to be able to expose all the misstatements or fallacies of aningenious opponent. That it is enough if there is always somebody ca-pable of answering them, so that nothing likely to mislead uninstructedpersons remains unrefuted. That simple minds, having been taught theobvious grounds of the truths inculcated on them, may trust to authorityfor the rest, and being aware that they have neither knowledge nor talentto resolve every difficulty which can be raised, may repose in the assur-On Liberty/37 ance that all those which have been raised have been or can be an- swered, by those who are specially trained to the task. Conceding to this view of the subject the utmost that can be claimed for it by those most easily satisfied with the amount of understanding oftruth which ought to accompany the belief of it; even so, the argumentfor free discussion is no way weakened. For even this doctrine acknowl-edges that mankind ought to have a rational assurance that all objec-tions have been satisfactorily answered; and how are they to be an-swered if that which requires to be answered is not spoken? or how canthe answer be known to be satisfactory, if the objectors have no oppor-tunity of showing that it is unsatisfactory? If not the public, at least thephilosophers and theologians who are to resolve the difficulties, mustmake themselves familiar with those difficulties in their most puzzlingform; and this cannot be accomplished unless they are freely stated, andplaced in the most advantageous light which they admit of. The Catho-lic Church has its own way of dealing with this embarrassing problem.It makes a broad separation between those who can be permitted toreceive its doctrines on conviction, and those who must accept them ontrust. Neither, indeed, are allowed any choice as to what they will ac-cept; but the clergy, such at least as can be fully confided in, mayadmissibly and meritoriously make themselves acquainted with the ar-guments of opponents, in order to answer them, and may, therefore,read heretical books; the laity, not unless by special permission, hard tobe obtained. This discipline recognises a knowledge of the enemy's caseas beneficial to the teachers, but finds means, consistent with this, ofdenying it to the rest of the world: thus giving to the elite more mentalculture, though not more mental freedom, than it allows to the mass. Bythis device it succeeds in obtaining the kind of mental superiority whichits purposes require; for though culture without freedom never made alarge and liberal mind, it can make a clever nisi prius advocate of acause. But in countries professing Protestantism, this resource is de-nied; since Protestants hold, at least in theory, that the responsibility forthe choice of a religion must be borne by each for himself, and cannot bethrown off upon teachers. Besides, in the present state of the world, it ispractically impossible that writings which are read by the instructed canbe kept from the uninstructed. If the teachers of mankind are to becognisant of all that they ought to know, everything must be free to bewritten and published without restraint. If, however, the mischievous operation of the absence of free dis-38/John Stuart Mill cussion, when the received opinions are true, were confined to leaving men ignorant of the grounds of those opinions, it might be thought thatthis, if an intellectual, is no moral evil, and does not affect the worth ofthe opinions, regarded in their influence on the character. The fact, how-ever, is, that not only the grounds of the opinion are forgotten in theabsence of discussion, but too often the meaning of the opinion itself.The words which convey it cease to suggest ideas, or suggest only asmall portion of those they were originally employed to communicate.Instead of a vivid conception and a living belief, there remain only a fewphrases retained by rote; or, if any part, the shell and husk only of themeaning is retained, the finer essence being lost. The great chapter inhuman history which this fact occupies and fills, cannot be too earnestlystudied and meditated on. It is illustrated in the experience of almost all ethical doctrines and religious creeds. They are all full of meaning and vitality to those whooriginate them, and to the direct disciples of the originators. Their meaningcontinues to be felt in undiminished strength, and is perhaps brought outinto even fuller consciousness, so long as the struggle lasts to give thedoctrine or creed an ascendancy over other creeds. At last it either pre-vails, and becomes the general opinion, or its progress stops; it keepspossession of the ground it has gained, but ceases to spread further.When either of these results has become apparent, controversy on thesubject flags, and gradually dies away. The doctrine has taken its place,if not as a received opinion, as one of the admitted sects or divisions ofopinion: those who hold it have generally inherited, not adopted it; andconversion from one of these doctrines to another, being now an excep-tional fact, occupies little place in the thoughts of their professors. In-stead of being, as at first, constantly on the alert either to defend them-selves against the world, or to bring the world over to them, they havesubsided into acquiescence, and neither listen, when they can help it, toarguments against their creed, nor trouble dissentients (if there be such)with arguments in its favour. From this time may usually be dated thedecline in the living power of the doctrine. We often hear the teachers of all creeds lamenting the difficulty of keeping up in the minds of believers a lively apprehension of the truthwhich they nominally recognise, so that it may penetrate the feelings,and acquire a real mastery over the conduct. No such difficulty is com-plained of while the creed is still fighting for its existence: even theweaker combatants then know and feel what they are fighting for, andOn Liberty/39 the difference between it and other doctrines; and in that period of every creed's existence, not a few persons may be found, who have realised itsfundamental principles in all the forms of thought, have weighed andconsidered them in all their important bearings, and have experiencedthe full effect on the character which belief in that creed ought to pro-duce in a mind thoroughly imbued with it. But when it has come to be anhereditary creed, and to be received passively, not actively\u2014when themind is no longer compelled, in the same degree as at first, to exerciseits vital powers on the questions which its belief presents to it, there is aprogressive tendency to forget all of the belief except the formularies, orto give it a dull and torpid assent, as if accepting it on trust dispensedwith the necessity of realising it in consciousness, or testing it by per-sonal experience, until it almost ceases to connect itself at all with theinner life of the human being. Then are seen the cases, so frequent in thisage of the world as almost to form the majority, in which the creedremains as it were outside the mind, incrusting and petrifying it againstall other influences addressed to the higher parts of our nature; mani-festing its power by not suffering any fresh and living conviction to getin, but itself doing nothing for the mind or heart, except standing senti-nel over them to keep them vacant. To what an extent doctrines intrinsically fitted to make the deepest impression upon the mind may remain in it as dead beliefs, withoutbeing ever realised in the imagination, the feelings, or the understand-ing, is exemplified by the manner in which the majority of believers holdthe doctrines of Christianity. By Christianity I here mean what is ac-counted such by all churches and sects\u2014the maxims and precepts con-tained in the New Testament. These are considered sacred, and acceptedas laws, by all professing Christians. Yet it is scarcely too much to saythat not one Christian in a thousand guides or tests his individual con-duct by reference to those laws. The standard to which he does refer it,is the custom of his nation, his class, or his religious profession. He hasthus, on the one hand, a collection of ethical maxims, which he believesto have been vouchsafed to him by infallible wisdom as rules for hisgovernment; and on the other a set of every-day judgments and prac-tices, which go a certain length with some of those maxims, not so greata length with others, stand in direct opposition to some, and are, on thewhole, a compromise between the Christian creed and the interests andsuggestions of worldly life. To the first of these standards he gives hishomage; to the other his real allegiance.40/John Stuart Mill All Christians believe that the blessed are the poor and humble, and those who are ill-used by the world; that it is easier for a camel to passthrough the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom ofheaven; that they should judge not, lest they be judged; that they shouldswear not at all; that they should love their neighbour as themselves;that if one take their cloak, they should give him their coat also; thatthey should take no thought for the morrow; that if they would be per-fect they should sell all that they have and give it to the poor. They arenot insincere when they say that they believe these things. They do be-lieve them, as people believe what they have always heard lauded andnever discussed. But in the sense of that living belief which regulatesconduct, they believe these doctrines just up to the point to which it isusual to act upon them. The doctrines in their integrity are serviceableto pelt adversaries with; and it is understood that they are to be putforward (when possible) as the reasons for whatever people do that theythink laudable. But any one who reminded them that the maxims requirean infinity of things which they never even think of doing, would gainnothing but to be classed among those very unpopular characters whoaffect to be better than other people. The doctrines have no hold onordinary believers\u2014are not a power in their minds. They have an ha-bitual respect for the sound of them, but no feeling which spreads fromthe words to the things signified, and forces the mind to take them in,and make them conform to the formula. Whenever conduct is concerned,they look round for Mr. A and B to direct them how far to go in obeyingChrist. Now we may be well assured that the case was not thus, but far otherwise, with the early Christians. Had it been thus, Christianity neverwould have expanded from an obscure sect of the despised Hebrewsinto the religion of the Roman empire. When their enemies said, \"Seehow these Christians love one another\" (a remark not likely to be madeby anybody now), they assuredly had a much livelier feeling of the mean-ing of their creed than they have ever had since. And to this cause,probably, it is chiefly owing that Christianity now makes so little progressin extending its domain, and after eighteen centuries is still nearly con-fined to Europeans and the descendants of Europeans. Even with thestrictly religious, who are much in earnest about their doctrines, andattach a greater amount of meaning to many of them than people ingeneral, it commonly happens that the part which is thus comparativelyactive in their minds is that which was made by Calvin, or Knox, orOn Liberty/41 some such person much nearer in character to themselves. The sayings of Christ coexist passively in their minds, producing hardly any effectbeyond what is caused by mere listening to words so amiable and bland.There are many reasons, doubtless, why doctrines which are the badgeof a sect retain more of their vitality than those common to all recognisedsects, and why more pains are taken by teachers to keep their meaningalive; but one reason certainly is, that the peculiar doctrines are morequestioned, and have to be oftener defended against open gainsayers.Both teachers and learners go to sleep at their post, as soon as there isno enemy in the field. The same thing holds true, generally speaking, of all traditional doctrines\u2014those of prudence and knowledge of life, as well as of mor-als or religion. All languages and literatures are full of general observa-tions on life, both as to what it is, and how to conduct oneself in it;observations which everybody knows, which everybody repeats, or hearswith acquiescence, which are received as truisms, yet of which mostpeople first truly learn the meaning when experience, generally of apainful kind, has made it a reality to them. How often, when smartingunder some unforeseen misfortune or disappointment, does a personcall to mind some proverb or common saying, familiar to him all hislife, the meaning of which, if he had ever before felt it as he does now,would have saved him from the calamity. There are indeed reasons forthis, other than the absence of discussion; there are many truths of whichthe full meaning cannot be realised until personal experience has broughtit home. But much more of the meaning even of these would have beenunderstood, and what was understood would have been far more deeplyimpressed on the mind, if the man had been accustomed to hear it ar-gued pro and con by people who did understand it. The fatal tendency ofmankind to leave off thinking about a thing when it is no longer doubt-ful, is the cause of half their errors. A contemporary author has wellspoken of \"the deep slumber of a decided opinion.\" But what! (it may be asked) Is the absence of unanimity an indis- pensable condition of true knowledge? Is it necessary that some part ofmankind should persist in error to enable any to realise the truth? Doesa belief cease to be real and vital as soon as it is generally received\u2014and is a proposition never thoroughly understood and felt unless somedoubt of it remains? As soon as mankind have unanimously accepted atruth, does the truth perish within them? The highest aim and best resultof improved intelligence, it has hitherto been thought, is to unite man-42/John Stuart Mill kind more and more in the acknowledgment of all important truths; and does the intelligence only last as long as it has not achieved its object?Do the fruits of conquest perish by the very completeness of the victory? I affirm no such thing. As mankind improve, the number of doc- trines which are no longer disputed or doubted will be constantly on theincrease: and the well-being of mankind may almost be measured by thenumber and gravity of the truths which have reached the point of beinguncontested. The cessation, on one question after another, of seriouscontroversy, is one of the necessary incidents of the consolidation ofopinion; a consolidation as salutary in the case of true opinions, as it isdangerous and noxious when the opinions are erroneous. But thoughthis gradual narrowing of the bounds of diversity of opinion is neces-sary in both senses of the term, being at once inevitable and indispens-able, we are not therefore obliged to conclude that all its consequencesmust be beneficial. The loss of so important an aid to the intelligent andliving apprehension of a truth, as is afforded by the necessity of explain-ing it to, or defending it against, opponents, though not sufficient tooutweigh, is no trifling drawback from, the benefit of its universal rec-ognition. Where this advantage can no longer be had, I confess I shouldlike to see the teachers of mankind endeavouring to provide a substitutefor it; some contrivance for making the difficulties of the question aspresent to the learner's consciousness, as if they were pressed upon himby a dissentient champion, eager for his conversion. But instead of seeking contrivances for this purpose, they have lost those they formerly had. The Socratic dialectics, so magnificently ex-emplified in the dialogues of Plato, were a contrivance of this descrip-tion. They were essentially a negative discussion of the great question ofphilosophy and life, directed with consummate skill to the purpose ofconvincing any one who had merely adopted the commonplaces of re-ceived opinion that he did not understand the subject\u2014that he as yetattached no definite meaning to the doctrines he professed; in order that,becoming aware of his ignorance, he might be put in the way to obtain astable belief, resting on a clear apprehension both of the meaning ofdoctrines and of their evidence. The school disputations of the MiddleAges had a somewhat similar object. They were intended to make surethat the pupil understood his own opinion, and (by necessary correla-tion) the opinion opposed to it, and could enforce the grounds of the oneand confute those of the other. These last-mentioned contests had indeedthe incurable defect, that the premises appealed to were taken from au-On Liberty/43 thority, not from reason; and, as a discipline to the mind, they were in every respect inferior to the powerful dialectics which formed the intel-lects of the \"Socratici viri\"; but the modern mind owes far more to boththan it is generally willing to admit, and the present modes of educationcontain nothing which in the smallest degree supplies the place either ofthe one or of the other. A person who derives all his instruction fromteachers or books, even if he escape the besetting temptation of content-ing himself with cram, is under no compulsion to hear both sides; ac-cordingly it is far from a frequent accomplishment, even among think-ers, to know both sides; and the weakest part of what everybody says indefence of his opinion is what he intends as a reply to antagonists. It is the fashion of the present time to disparage negative logic\u2014 that which points out weaknesses in theory or errors in practice, withoutestablishing positive truths. Such negative criticism would indeed bepoor enough as an ultimate result; but as a means to attaining any posi-tive knowledge or conviction worthy the name, it cannot be valued toohighly; and until people are again systematically trained to it, there willbe few great thinkers, and a low general average of intellect, in any butthe mathematical and physical departments of speculation. On any othersubject no one's opinions deserve the name of knowledge, except so faras he has either had forced upon him by others, or gone through ofhimself, the same mental process which would have been required ofhim in carrying on an active controversy with opponents. That, there-fore, which when absent, it is so indispensable, but so difficult, to cre-ate, how worse than absurd it is to forego, when spontaneously offeringitself! If there are any persons who contest a received opinion, or whowill do so if law or opinion will let them, let us thank them for it, openour minds to listen to them, and rejoice that there is some one to do forus what we otherwise ought, if we have any regard for either the cer-tainty or the vitality of our convictions, to do with much greater labourfor ourselves. It still remains to speak of one of the principal causes which make diversity of opinion advantageous, and will continue to do so until man-kind shall have entered a stage of intellectual advancement which atpresent seems at an incalculable distance. We have hitherto consideredonly two possibilities: that the received opinion may be false, and someother opinion, consequently, true; or that, the received opinion beingtrue, a conflict with the opposite error is essential to a clear apprehen-sion and deep feeling of its truth. But there is a commoner case than44/John Stuart Mill either of these; when the conflicting doctrines, instead of being one true and the other false, share the truth between them; and the nonconform-ing opinion is needed to supply the remainder of the truth, of which thereceived doctrine embodies only a part. Popular opinions, on subjectsnot palpable to sense, are often true, but seldom or never the wholetruth. They are a part of the truth; sometimes a greater, sometimes asmaller part, but exaggerated, distorted, and disjointed from the truthsby which they ought to be accompanied and limited. Heretical opinions,on the other hand, are generally some of these suppressed and neglectedtruths, bursting the bonds which kept them down, and either seekingreconciliation with the truth contained in the common opinion, or frontingit as enemies, and setting themselves up, with similar exclusiveness, asthe whole truth. The latter case is hitherto the most frequent, as, in thehuman mind, one-sidedness has always been the rule, and many-sidednessthe exception. Hence, even in revolutions of opinion, one part of thetruth usually sets while another rises. Even progress, which ought tosuperadd, for the most part only substitutes, one partial and incompletetruth for another; improvement consisting chiefly in this, that the newfragment of truth is more wanted, more adapted to the needs of the time,than that which it displaces. Such being the partial character of prevail-ing opinions, even when resting on a true foundation, every opinionwhich embodies somewhat of the portion of truth which the commonopinion omits, ought to be considered precious, with whatever amountof error and confusion that truth may be blended. No sober judge ofhuman affairs will feel bound to be indignant because those who forceon our notice truths which we should otherwise have overlooked, over-look some of those which we see. Rather, he will think that so long aspopular truth is one-sided, it is more desirable than otherwise that un-popular truth should have one-sided assertors too; such being usuallythe most energetic, and the most likely to compel reluctant attention tothe fragment of wisdom which they proclaim as if it were the whole. Thus, in the eighteenth century, when nearly all the instructed, and all those of the uninstructed who were led by them, were lost in admira-tion of what is called civilisation, and of the marvels of modern science,literature, and philosophy, and while greatly overrating the amount ofunlikeness between the men of modern and those of ancient times, in-dulged the belief that the whole of the difference was in their own favour;with what a salutary shock did the paradoxes of Rousseau explode likebombshells in the midst, dislocating the compact mass of one-sided opin-On Liberty/45 ion, and forcing its elements to recombine in a better form and with additional ingredients. Not that the current opinions were on the wholefarther from the truth than Rousseau's were; on the contrary, they werenearer to it; they contained more of positive truth, and very much less oferror. Nevertheless there lay in Rousseau's doctrine, and has floateddown the stream of opinion along with it, a considerable amount ofexactly those truths which the popular opinion wanted; and these are thedeposit which was left behind when the flood subsided. The superiorworth of simplicity of life, the enervating and demoralising effect of thetrammels and hypocrisies of artificial society, are ideas which have neverbeen entirely absent from cultivated minds since Rousseau wrote; andthey will in time produce their due effect, though at present needing tobe asserted as much as ever, and to be asserted by deeds, for words, onthis subject, have nearly exhausted their power. In politics, again, it is almost a commonplace, that a party of order or stability, and a party of progress or reform, are both necessary ele-ments of a healthy state of political life; until the one or the other shallhave so enlarged its mental grasp as to be a party equally of order and ofprogress, knowing and distinguishing what is fit to be preserved fromwhat ought to be swept away. Each of these modes of thinking derivesits utility from the deficiencies of the other; but it is in a great measurethe opposition of the other that keeps each within the limits of reasonand sanity. Unless opinions favourable to democracy and to aristocracy,to property and to equality, to cooperation and to competition, to luxuryand to abstinence, to sociality and individuality, to liberty and disci-pline, and all the other standing antagonisms of practical life, are ex-pressed with equal freedom, and enforced and defended with equal tal-ent and energy, there is no chance of both elements obtaining their due;one scale is sure to go up, and the other down. Truth, in the great prac-tical concerns of life, is so much a question of the reconciling and com-bining of opposites, that very few have minds sufficiently capaciousand impartial to make the adjustment with an approach to correctness,and it has to be made by the rough process of a struggle between com-batants fighting under hostile banners. On any of the great open ques-tions just enumerated, if either of the two opinions has a better claimthan the other, not merely to be tolerated, but to be encouraged andcountenanced, it is the one which happens at the particular time andplace to be in a minority. That is the opinion which, for the time being,represents the neglected interests, the side of human well-being which is46/John Stuart Mill in danger of obtaining less than its share. I am aware that there is not, in this country, any intolerance of differences of opinion on most of thesetopics. They are adduced to show, by admitted and multiplied examples,the universality of the fact, that only through diversity of opinion isthere, in the existing state of human intellect, a chance of fair play to allsides of the truth. When there are persons to be found who form anexception to the apparent unanimity of the world on any subject, even ifthe world is in the right, it is always probable that dissentients havesomething worth hearing to say for themselves, and that truth wouldlose something by their silence. It may be objected, \"But some received principles, especially on the highest and most vital subjects, are more than half-truths. The Christianmorality, for instance, is the whole truth on that subject, and if any oneteaches a morality which varies from it, he is wholly in error.\" As this isof all cases the most important in practice, none can be fitter to test thegeneral maxim. But before pronouncing what Christian morality is or isnot, it would be desirable to decide what is meant by Christian morality.If it means the morality of the New Testament, I wonder that any onewho derives his knowledge of this from the book itself, can suppose thatit was announced, or intended, as a complete doctrine of morals. TheGospel always refers to a pre-existing morality, and confines its pre-cepts to the particulars in which that morality was to be corrected, orsuperseded by a wider and higher; expressing itself, moreover, in termsmost general, often impossible to be interpreted literally, and possessingrather the impressiveness of poetry or eloquence than the precision oflegislation. To extract from it a body of ethical doctrine, has never beenpossible without eking it out from the Old Testament, that is, from asystem elaborate indeed, but in many respects barbarous, and intendedonly for a barbarous people. St. Paul, a declared enemy to this Judaicalmode of interpreting the doctrine and filling up the scheme of his Mas-ter, equally assumes a preexisting morality, namely that of the Greeksand Romans; and his advice to Christians is in a great measure a systemof accommodation to that; even to the extent of giving an apparent sanc-tion to slavery. What is called Christian, but should rather be termedtheological, morality, was not the work of Christ or the Apostles, but isof much later origin, having been gradually built up by the Catholicchurch of the first five centuries, and though not implicitly adopted bymoderns and Protestants, has been much less modified by them thanmight have been expected. For the most part, indeed, they have con-On Liberty/47 tented themselves with cutting off the additions which had been made to it in the Middle Ages, each sect supplying the place by fresh additions,adapted to its own character and tendencies. That mankind owe a great debt to this morality, and to its early teachers, I should be the last person to deny; but I do not scruple to sayof it that it is, in many important points, incomplete and one-sided, andthat unless ideas and feelings, not sanctioned by it, had contributed tothe formation of European life and character, human affairs would havebeen in a worse condition than they now are. Christian morality (socalled) has all the characters of a reaction; it is, in great part, a protestagainst Paganism. Its ideal is negative rather than positive; passive ratherthan active; Innocence rather than Nobleness; Abstinence from Evil,rather than energetic Pursuit of Good; in its precepts (as has been wellsaid) \"thou shalt not\" predominates unduly over \"thou shalt.\" In itshorror of sensuality, it made an idol of asceticism, which has been gradu-ally compromised away into one of legality. It holds out the hope ofheaven and the threat of hell, as the appointed and appropriate motivesto a virtuous life: in this falling far below the best of the ancients, anddoing what lies in it to give to human morality an essentially selfishcharacter, by disconnecting each man's feelings of duty from the inter-ests of his fellow creatures, except so far as a self-interested inducementis offered to him for consulting them. It is essentially a doctrine of pas-sive obedience; it inculcates submission to all authorities found estab-lished; who indeed are not to be actively obeyed when they commandwhat religion forbids, but who are not to be resisted, far less rebelledagainst, for any amount of wrong to ourselves. And while, in the moral-ity of the best Pagan nations, duty to the State holds even a dispropor-tionate place, infringing on the just liberty of the individual; in purelyChristian ethics, that grand department of duty is scarcely noticed oracknowledged. It is in the Koran, not the New Testament, that we readthe maxim\u2014\"A ruler who appoints any man to an office, when there isin his dominions another man better qualified for it, sins against Godand against the State.\" What little recognition the idea of obligation tothe public obtains in modern morality is derived from Greek and Romansources, not from Christian; as, even in the morality of private life,whatever exists of magnanimity, highmindedness, personal dignity, eventhe sense of honour, is derived from the purely human, not the religiouspart of our education, and never could have grown out of a standard ofethics in which the only worth, professedly recognised, is that of obedi-48/John Stuart Mill ence. I am as far as any one from pretending that these defects are neces- sarily inherent in the Christian ethics in every manner in which it can beconceived, or that the many requisites of a complete moral doctrinewhich it does not contain do not admit of being reconciled with it. Farless would I insinuate this of the doctrines and precepts of Christ him-self. I believe that the sayings of Christ are all that I can see any evi-dence of their having been intended to be; that they are irreconcilablewith nothing which a comprehensive morality requires; that everythingwhich is excellent in ethics may be brought within them, with no greaterviolence to their language than has been done to it by all who haveattempted to deduce from them any practical system of conduct what-ever. But it is quite consistent with this to believe that they contain, andwere meant to contain, only a part of the truth; that many essentialelements of the highest morality are among the things which are notprovided for, nor intended to be provided for, in the recorded deliver-ances of the Founder of Christianity, and which have been entirely thrownaside in the system of ethics erected on the basis of those deliverancesby the Christian Church. And this being so, I think it a great error topersist in attempting to find in the Christian doctrine that complete rulefor our guidance which its author intended it to sanction and enforce,but only partially to provide. I believe, too, that this narrow theory isbecoming a grave practical evil, detracting greatly from the moral train-ing and instruction which so many well-meaning persons are now atlength exerting themselves to promote. I much fear that by attempting toform the mind and feelings on an exclusively religious type, and dis-carding those secular standards (as for want of a better name they maybe called) which heretofore coexisted with and supplemented the Chris-tian ethics, receiving some of its spirit, and infusing into it some oftheirs, there will result, and is even now resulting, a low, abject, serviletype of character, which, submit itself as it may to what it deems theSupreme Will, is incapable of rising to or sympathising in the concep-tion of Supreme Goodness. I believe that other ethics than any whichcan be evolved from exclusively Christian sources, must exist side byside with Christian ethics to produce the moral regeneration of man-kind; and that the Christian system is no exception to the rule, that in animperfect state of the human mind the interests of truth require a diver-sity of opinions. It is not necessary that in ceasing to ignore the moral truths notOn Liberty/49 contained in Christianity men should ignore any of those which it does contain. Such prejudice, or oversight, when it occurs, is altogether anevil; but it is one from which we cannot hope to be always exempt, andmust be regarded as the price paid for an inestimable good. The exclu-sive pretension made by a part of the truth to be the whole, must andought to be protested against; and if a reactionary impulse should makethe protestors unjust in their turn, this one-sidedness, like the other, maybe lamented, but must be tolerated. If Christians would teach infidels tobe just to Christianity, they should themselves be just to infidelity. It cando truth no service to blink the fact, known to all who have the mostordinary acquaintance with literary history, that a large portion of thenoblest and most valuable moral teaching has been the work, not only ofmen who did not know, but of men who knew and rejected, the Christianfaith. I do not pretend that the most unlimited use of the freedom of enun- ciating all possible opinions would put an end to the evils of religious orphilosophical sectarianism. Every truth which men of narrow capacityare in earnest about, is sure to be asserted, inculcated, and in manyways even acted on, as if no other truth existed in the world, or at allevents none that could limit or qualify the first. I acknowledge that thetendency of all opinions to become sectarian is not cured by the freestdiscussion, but is often heightened and exacerbated thereby; the truthwhich ought to have been, but was not, seen, being rejected all the moreviolently because proclaimed by persons regarded as opponents. But itis not on the impassioned partisan, it is on the calmer and more disinter-ested bystander, that this collision of opinions works its salutary effect.Not the violent conflict between parts of the truth, but the quiet suppres-sion of half of it, is the formidable evil; there is always hope whenpeople are forced to listen to both sides; it is when they attend only toone that errors harden into prejudices, and truth itself ceases to have theeffect of truth, by being exaggerated into falsehood. And since there arefew mental attributes more rare than that judicial faculty which can sitin intelligent judgment between two sides of a question, of which onlyone is represented by an advocate before it, truth has no chance but inproportion as every side of it, every opinion which embodies any frac-tion of the truth, not only finds advocates, but is so advocated as to belistened to. We have now recognised the necessity to the mental well-being of mankind (on which all their other well-being depends) of freedom of50/John Stuart Mill opinion, and freedom of the expression of opinion, on four distinct grounds; which we will now briefly recapitulate. First, if any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our owninfallibility. Secondly, though the silenced opinion be an error, it may, and very commonly does, contain a portion of truth; and since the general orprevailing opinion on any subject is rarely or never the whole truth, it isonly by the collision of adverse opinions that the remainder of the truthhas any chance of being supplied. Thirdly, even if the received opinion be not only true, but the whole truth; unless it is suffered to be, and actually is, vigorously and ear-nestly contested, it will, by most of those who receive it, be held in themanner of a prejudice, with little comprehension or feeling of its ratio-nal grounds. And not only this, but, fourthly, the meaning of the doc-trine itself will be in danger of being lost, or enfeebled, and deprived ofits vital effect on the character and conduct: the dogma becoming a mereformal profession, inefficacious for good, but cumbering the ground,and preventing the growth of any real and heartfelt conviction, fromreason or personal experience. Before quitting the subject of freedom of opinion, it is fit to take some notice of those who say that the free expression of all opinionsshould be permitted, on condition that the manner be temperate, and donot pass the bounds of fair discussion. Much might be said on the im-possibility of fixing where these supposed bounds are to be placed; forif the test be offence to those whose opinions are attacked, I think expe-rience testifies that this offence is given whenever the attack is tellingand powerful, and that every opponent who pushes them hard, and whomthey find it difficult to answer, appears to them, if he shows any strongfeeling on the subject, an intemperate opponent. But this, though an important consideration in a practical point of view, merges in a more fundamental objection. Undoubtedly the mannerof asserting an opinion, even though it be a true one, may be very objec-tionable, and may justly incur severe censure. But the principal offencesof the kind are such as it is mostly impossible, unless by accidental self-betrayal, to bring home to conviction. The gravest of them is, to arguesophistically, to suppress facts or arguments, to misstate the elements ofthe case, or misrepresent the opposite opinion. But all this, even to themost aggravated degree, is so continually done in perfect good faith, byOn Liberty/51 persons who are not considered, and in many other respects may not deserve to be considered, ignorant or incompetent, that it is rarely pos-sible, on adequate grounds, conscientiously to stamp the misrepresenta-tion as morally culpable; and still less could law presume to interferewith this kind of controversial misconduct. With regard to what is com-monly meant by intemperate discussion, namely invective, sarcasm,personality, and the like, the denunciation of these weapons would de-serve more sympathy if it were ever proposed to interdict them equallyto both sides; but it is only desired to restrain the employment of themagainst the prevailing opinion: against the unprevailing they may notonly be used without general disapproval, but will be likely to obtain forhim who uses them the praise of honest zeal and righteous indignation.Yet whatever mischief arises from their use is greatest when they areemployed against the comparatively defenceless; and whatever unfairadvantage can be derived by any opinion from this mode of asserting it,accrues almost exclusively to received opinions. The worst offence ofthis kind which can be committed by a polemic is to stigmatise thosewho hold the contrary opinion as bad and immoral men. To calumny ofthis sort, those who hold any unpopular opinion are peculiarly exposed,because they are in general few and uninfluential, and nobody but them-selves feels much interested in seeing justice done them; but this weaponis, from the nature of the case, denied to those who attack a prevailingopinion: they can neither use it with safety to themselves, nor, if theycould, would it do anything but recoil on their own cause. In general,opinions contrary to those commonly received can only obtain a hearingby studied moderation of language, and the most cautious avoidance ofunnecessary offence, from which they hardly ever deviate even in a slightdegree without losing ground: while unmeasured vituperation employedon the side of the prevailing opinion really does deter people from pro-fessing contrary opinions, and from listening to those who profess them. For the interest, therefore, of truth and justice, it is far more impor- tant to restrain this employment of vituperative language than the other;and, for example, if it were necessary to choose, there would be muchmore need to discourage offensive attacks on infidelity than on religion.It is, however, obvious that law and authority have no business withrestraining either, while opinion ought, in every instance, to determineits verdict by the circumstances of the individual case; condemning ev-ery one, on whichever side of the argument he places himself, in whosemode of advocacy either want of candour, or malignity, bigotry, or in-52/John Stuart Mill tolerance of feeling manifest themselves; but not inferring these vices from the side which a person takes, though it be the contrary side of thequestion to our own; and giving merited honour to every one, whateveropinion he may hold, who has calmness to see and honesty to state whathis opponents and their opinions really are, exaggerating nothing to theirdiscredit, keeping nothing back which tells, or can be supposed to tell,in their favour. This is the real morality of public discussion: and ifoften violated, I am happy to think that there are many controversialistswho to a great extent observe it, and a still greater number who consci-entiously strive towards it. Chapter 3.Of Individuality, as one of the Elements of Well-being. Such being the reasons which make it imperative that human beingsshould be free to form opinions, and to express their opinions withoutreserve; and such the baneful consequences to the intellectual, and throughthat to the moral nature of man, unless this liberty is either conceded, orasserted in spite of prohibition; let us next examine whether the samereasons do not require that men should be free to act upon their opin-ions\u2014to carry these out in their lives, without hindrance, either physi-cal or moral, from their fellow-men, so long as it is at their own risk andperil. This last proviso is of course indispensable. No one pretends that actions should be as free as opinions. On the contrary, even opinionslose their immunity when the circumstances in which they are expressedare such as to constitute their expression a positive instigation to somemischievous act. An opinion that corn-dealers are starvers of the poor,or that private property is robbery, ought to be unmolested when simplycirculated through the press, but may justly incur punishment when de-livered orally to an excited mob assembled before the house of a corn-dealer, or when handed about among the same mob in the form of aplacard. Acts, of whatever kind, which, without justifiable cause, doharm to others, may be, and in the more important cases absolutelyrequire to be, controlled by the unfavourable sentiments, and, when need-ful, by the active interference of mankind. The liberty of the individualmust be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to otherpeople. But if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them,On Liberty/53 and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgment in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinion shouldbe free, prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, tocarry his opinions into practice at his own cost. That mankind are notinfallible; that their truths, for the most part, are only half-truths; thatunity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparisonof opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil, but agood, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognisingall sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action,not less than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind areimperfect there should be different opinions, so it is that there should bedifferent experiments of living; that free scope should be given to variet-ies of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of differentmodes of life should be proved practically, when any one thinks fit to trythem. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarilyconcern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person'sown character, but the traditions or customs of other people are the ruleof conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of humanhappiness, and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress. In maintaining this principle, the greatest difficulty to be encoun- tered does not lie in the appreciation of means towards an acknowledgedend, but in the indifference of persons in general to the end itself. If itwere felt that the free development of individuality is one of the leadingessentials of well-being; that it is not only a co-ordinate element with allthat is designated by the terms civilisation, instruction, education, cul-ture, but is itself a necessary part and condition of all those things; therewould be no danger that liberty should be undervalued, and the adjust-ment of the boundaries between it and social control would present noextraordinary difficulty. But the evil is, that individual spontaneity ishardly recognised by the common modes of thinking as having any in-trinsic worth, or deserving any regard on its own account. The majority,being satisfied with the ways of mankind as they now are (for it is theywho make them what they are), cannot comprehend why those waysshould not be good enough for everybody; and what is more, spontane-ity forms no part of the ideal of the majority of moral and social reform-ers, but is rather looked on with jealousy, as a troublesome and perhapsrebellious obstruction to the general acceptance of what these reform-ers, in their own judgment, think would be best for mankind. Few per-sons, out of Germany, even comprehend the meaning of the doctrine54/John Stuart Mill which Wilhelm von Humboldt, so eminent both as a savant and as a politician, made the text of a treatise- that \"the end of man, or thatwhich is prescribed by the eternal or immutable dictates of reason, andnot suggested by vague and transient desires, is the highest and mostharmonious development of his powers to a complete and consistentwhole\"; that, therefore, the object \"towards which every human beingmust ceaselessly direct his efforts, and on which especially those whodesign to influence their fellow-men must ever keep their eyes, is theindividuality of power and development\"; that for this there are tworequisites, \"freedom, and variety of situations\"; and that from the unionof these arise \"individual vigour and manifold diversity,\" which com-bine themselves in \"originality.\" 6 Little, however, as people are accustomed to a doctrine like that of Von Humboldt, and surprising as it may be to them to find so high avalue attached to individuality, the question, one must nevertheless think,can only be one of degree. No one's idea of excellence in conduct is thatpeople should do absolutely nothing but copy one another. No one wouldassert that people ought not to put into their mode of life, and into theconduct of their concerns, any impress whatever of their own judgment,or of their own individual character. On the other hand, it would beabsurd to pretend that people ought to live as if nothing whatever hadbeen known in the world before they came into it; as if experience had asyet done nothing towards showing that one mode of existence or of con-duct, is preferable to another. Nobody denies that people should be sotaught and trained in youth as to know and benefit by the ascertainedresults of human experience. But it is the privilege and proper conditionof a human being, arrived at the maturity of his faculties, to use andinterpret experience in his own way. It is for him to find out what part ofrecorded experience is properly applicable to his own circumstancesand character. The traditions and customs of other people are, to a cer-tain extent, evidence of what their experience has taught them; presump-tive evidence, and as such, have a claim to his deference: but, in the firstplace, their experience may be too narrow; or they may not have inter-preted it rightly. Secondly, their interpretation of experience may becorrect, but unsuitable to him. Customs are made for customary cir-cumstances and customary characters; and his circumstances or his char-acter may be uncustomary. Thirdly, though the customs be both good ascustoms, and suitable to him, yet to conform to custom, merely as cus-tom, does not educate or develop in him any of the qualities which areOn Liberty/55 the distinctive endowment of a human being. The human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and evenmoral preference, are exercised only in making a choice. He who doesanything because it is the custom makes no choice. He gains no practiceeither in discerning or in desiring what is best. The mental and moral,like the muscular powers, are improved only by being used. The facul-ties are called into no exercise by doing a thing merely because othersdo it, no more than by believing a thing only because others believe it. Ifthe grounds of an opinion are not conclusive to the person's own reason,his reason cannot be strengthened, but is likely to be weakened, by hisadopting it: and if the inducements to an act are not such as areconsentaneous to his own feelings and character (where affection, or therights of others, are not concerned) it is so much done towards renderinghis feelings and character inert and torpid, instead of active and ener-getic. He who lets the world, or his own portion of it, choose his plan of life for him, has no need of any other faculty than the ape-like one ofimitation. He who chooses his plan for himself, employs all his facul-ties. He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee,activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, andwhen he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberatedecision. And these qualities he requires and exercises exactly in pro-portion as the part of his conduct which he determines according to hisown judgment and feelings is a large one. It is possible that he might beguided in some good path, and kept out of harm's way, without any ofthese things. But what will be his comparative worth as a human being?It really is of importance, not only what men do, but also what mannerof men they are that do it. Among the works of man, which human life isrightly employed in perfecting and beautifying, the first in importancesurely is man himself. Supposing it were possible to get houses built,corn grown, battles fought, causes tried, and even churches erected andprayers said, by machinery\u2014by automatons in human form\u2014it wouldbe a considerable loss to exchange for these automatons even the menand women who at present inhabit the more civilised parts of the world,and who assuredly are but starved specimens of what nature can andwill produce. Human nature is not a machine to be built after a model,and set to do exactly the work prescribed for it, but a tree, which re-quires to grow and develop itself on all sides, according to the tendencyof the inward forces which make it a living thing.56/John Stuart Mill It will probably be conceded that it is desirable people should exer- cise their understandings, and that an intelligent following of custom, oreven occasionally an intelligent deviation from custom, is better than ablind and simply mechanical adhesion to it. To a certain extent it isadmitted that our understanding should be our own: but there is not thesame willingness to admit that our desires and impulses should be ourown likewise; or that to possess impulses of our own, and of any strength,is anything but a peril and a snare. Yet desires and impulses are as mucha part of a perfect human being as beliefs and restraints: and strongimpulses are only perilous when not properly balanced; when one set ofaims and inclinations is developed into strength, while others, whichought to co-exist with them, remain weak and inactive. It is not becausemen's desires are strong that they act ill; it is because their consciencesare weak. There is no natural connection between strong impulses and aweak conscience. The natural connection is the other way. To say thatone person's desires and feelings are stronger and more various thanthose of another, is merely to say that he has more of the raw material ofhuman nature, and is therefore capable, perhaps of more evil, but cer-tainly of more good. Strong impulses are but another name for energy.Energy may be turned to bad uses; but more good may always be madeof an energetic nature, than of an indolent and impassive one. Thosewho have most natural feeling are always those whose cultivated feel-ings may be made the strongest. The same strong susceptibilities whichmake the personal impulses vivid and powerful, are also the source fromwhence are generated the most passionate love of virtue, and the sternestself-control. It is through the cultivation of these that society both doesits duty and protects its interests: not by rejecting the stuff of whichheroes are made, because it knows not how to make them. A personwhose desires and impulses are his own\u2014are the expression of his ownnature, as it has been developed and modified by his own culture\u2014issaid to have a character. One whose desires and impulses are not hisown, has no character, no more than a steam-engine has a character. If,in addition to being his own, his impulses are strong, and are under thegovernment of a strong will, he has an energetic character. Whoeverthinks that individuality of desires and impulses should not be encour-aged to unfold itself, must maintain that society has no need of strongnatures-is not the better for containing many persons who have muchcharacter-and that a high general average of energy is not desirable. In some early states of society, these forces might be, and were, tooOn Liberty/57 much ahead of the power which society then possessed of disciplining and controlling them. There has been a time when the element of spon-taneity and individuality was in excess, and the social principle had ahard struggle with it. The difficulty then was to induce men of strongbodies or minds to pay obedience to any rules which required them tocontrol their impulses. To overcome this difficulty, law and discipline,like the Popes struggling against the Emperors, asserted a power overthe whole man, claiming to control all his life in order to control hischaracter-which society had not found any other sufficient means ofbinding. But society has now fairly got the better of individuality; andthe danger which threatens human nature is not the excess, but the defi-ciency, of personal impulses and preferences. Things are vastly changedsince the passions of those who were strong by station or by personalendowment were in a state of habitual rebellion against laws and ordi-nances, and required to be rigorously chained up to enable the personswithin their reach to enjoy any particle of security. In our times, fromthe highest class of society down to the lowest, every one lives as underthe eye of a hostile and dreaded censorship. Not only in what concernsothers, but in what concerns only themselves, the individual or the fam-ily do not ask themselves\u2014what do I prefer? or, what would suit mycharacter and disposition? or, what would allow the best and highest inme to have fair play, and enable it to grow and thrive? They ask them-selves, what is suitable to my position? what is usually done by personsof my station and pecuniary circumstances? or (worse still) what isusually done by persons of a station and circumstances superior to mine?I do not mean that they choose what is customary in preference to whatsuits their own inclination. It does not occur to them to have any inclina-tion, except for what is customary. Thus the mind itself is bowed to theyoke: even in what people do for pleasure, conformity is the first thingthought of; they like in crowds; they exercise choice only among thingscommonly done: peculiarity of taste, eccentricity of conduct, are shunnedequally with crimes: until by dint of not following their own nature theyhave no nature to follow: their human capacities are withered and starved:they become incapable of any strong wishes or native pleasures, and aregenerally without either opinions or feelings of home growth, or prop-erly their own. Now is this, or is it not, the desirable condition of humannature? It is so, on the Calvinistic theory. According to that, the one great offence of man is self-will. All the good of which humanity is capable is58/John Stuart Mill comprised in obedience. You have no choice; thus you must do, and no otherwise: \"whatever is not a duty, is a sin.\" Human nature being radi-cally corrupt, there is no redemption for any one until human nature iskilled within him. To one holding this theory of life, crushing out any ofthe human faculties, capacities, and susceptibilities, is no evil: man needsno capacity, but that of surrendering himself to the will of God: and if heuses any of his faculties for any other purpose but to do that supposedwill more effectually, he is better without them. This is the theory ofCalvinism; and it is held, in a mitigated form, by many who do notconsider themselves Calvinists; the mitigation consisting in giving a lessascetic interpretation to the alleged will of God; asserting it to be hiswill that mankind should gratify some of their inclinations; of coursenot in the manner they themselves prefer, but in the way of obedience,that is, in a way prescribed to them by authority; and, therefore, by thenecessary condition of the case, the same for all. In some such insidious form there is at present a strong tendency to this narrow theory of life, and to the pinched and hidebound type ofhuman character which it patronises. Many persons, no doubt, sincerelythink that human beings thus cramped and dwarfed are as their Makerdesigned them to be; just as many have thought that trees are a muchfiner thing when clipped into pollards, or cut out into figures of animals,than as nature made them. But if it be any part of religion to believe thatman was made by a good Being, it is more consistent with that faith tobelieve that this Being gave all human faculties that they might be culti-vated and unfolded, not rooted out and consumed, and that he takesdelight in every nearer approach made by his creatures to the ideal con-ception embodied in them, every increase in any of their capabilities ofcomprehension, of action, or of enjoyment. There is a different type ofhuman excellence from the Calvinistic: a conception of humanity ashaving its nature bestowed on it for other purposes than merely to beabnegated. \"Pagan self-assertion\" is one of the elements of human worth,as well as \"Christian self-denial.\" 7 There is a Greek ideal of self-devel- opment, which the Platonic and Christian ideal of self-government blendswith, but does not supersede. It may be better to be a John Knox than anAlcibiades, but it is better to be a Pericles than either; nor would aPericles, if we had one in these days, be without anything good whichbelonged to John Knox. It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it, and calling it forth, within the limitsOn Liberty/59 imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation; and as the works partakethe character of those who do them, by the same process human life alsobecomes rich, diversified, and animating, furnishing more abundant ali-ment to high thoughts and elevating feelings, and strengthening the tiewhich binds every individual to the race, by making the race infinitelybetter worth belonging to. In proportion to the development of his indi-viduality, each person becomes more valuable to himself, and is there-fore capable of being more valuable to others. There is a greater fulnessof life about his own existence, and when there is more life in the unitsthere is more in the mass which is composed of them. As much com-pression as is necessary to prevent the stronger specimens of humannature from encroaching on the rights of others cannot be dispensedwith; but for this there is ample compensation even in the point of viewof human development. The means of development which the individualloses by being prevented from gratifying his inclinations to the injury ofothers, are chiefly obtained at the expense of the development of otherpeople. And even to himself there is a full equivalent in the better devel-opment of the social part of his nature, rendered possible by the re-straint put upon the selfish part. To be held to rigid rules of justice forthe sake of others, develops the feelings and capacities which have thegood of others for their object. But to be restrained in things not affect-ing their good, by their mere displeasure, develops nothing valuable,except such force of character as may unfold itself in resisting the re-straint. If acquiesced in, it dulls and blunts the whole nature. To giveany fair play to the nature of each, it is essential that different personsshould be allowed to lead different lives. In proportion as this latitudehas been exercised in any age, has that age been noteworthy to posterity.Even despotism does not produce its worst effects, so long as individu-ality exists under it; and whatever crushes individuality is despotism, bywhatever name it may be called, and whether it professes to be enforc-ing the will of God or the injunctions of men. Having said that the individuality is the same thing with develop- ment, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces,or can produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close theargument: for what more or better can be said of any condition of hu-man affairs than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to thebest thing they can be? or what worse can be said of any obstruction togood than that it prevents this? Doubtless, however, these considerations60/John Stuart Mill will not suffice to convince those who most need convincing; and it is necessary further to show, that these developed human beings are ofsome use to the undeveloped\u2014to point out to those who do not desireliberty, and would not avail themselves of it, that they may be in someintelligible manner rewarded for allowing other people to make use of itwithout hindrance. In the first place, then, I would suggest that they might possibly learn something from them. It will not be denied by anybody, that origi-nality is a valuable element in human affairs. There is always need ofpersons not only to discover new truths, and point out when what wereonce truths are true no longer, but also to commence new practices, andset the example of more enlightened conduct, and better taste and sensein human life. This cannot well be gainsaid by anybody who does notbelieve that the world has already attained perfection in all its ways andpractices. It is true that this benefit is not capable of being rendered byeverybody alike: there are but few persons, in comparison with the wholeof mankind, whose experiments, if adopted by others, would be likely tobe any improvement on established practice. But these few are the saltof the earth; without them, human life would become a stagnant pool.Not only is it they who introduce good things which did not before exist;it is they who keep the life in those which already exist. If there werenothing new to be done, would human intellect cease to be necessary?Would it be a reason why those who do the old things should forget whythey are done, and do them like cattle, not like human beings? There isonly too great a tendency in the best beliefs and practices to degenerateinto the mechanical; and unless there were a succession of persons whoseeverrecurring originality prevents the grounds of those beliefs and prac-tices from becoming merely traditional, such dead matter would notresist the smallest shock from anything really alive, and there would beno reason why civilisation should not die out, as in the Byzantine Em-pire. Persons of genius, it is true, are, and are always likely to be, asmall minority; but in order to have them, it is necessary to preserve thesoil in which they grow. Genius can only breathe freely in an atmo-sphere of freedom. Persons of genius are, ex vi termini, more individualthan any other people\u2014less capable, consequently, of fitting themselves,without hurtful compression, into any of the small number of mouldswhich society provides in order to save its members the trouble of form-ing their own character. If from timidity they consent to be forced intoone of these moulds, and to let all that part of themselves which cannotOn Liberty/61 expand under the pressure remain unexpanded, society will be little the better for their genius. If they are of a strong character, and break theirfetters, they become a mark for the society which has not succeeded inreducing them to commonplace, to point out with solemn warning as\"wild,\" \"erratic,\" and the like; much as if one should complain of theNiagara river for not flowing smoothly between its banks like a Dutchcanal. I insist thus emphatically on the importance of genius, and the ne- cessity of allowing it to unfold itself freely both in thought and in prac-tice, being well aware that no one will deny the position in theory, butknowing also that almost every one, in reality, is totally indifferent to it.People think genius a fine thing if it enables a man to write an excitingpoem, or paint a picture. But in its true sense, that of originality inthought and action, though no one says that it is not a thing to be ad-mired, nearly all, at heart, think that they can do very well without it.Unhappily this is too natural to be wondered at. Originality is the onething which unoriginal minds cannot feel the use of. They cannot seewhat it is to do for them: how should they? If they could see what itwould do for them, it would not be originality. The first service whichoriginality has to render them, is that of opening their eyes: which beingonce fully done, they would have a chance of being themselves original.Meanwhile, recollecting that nothing was ever yet done which some onewas not the first to do, and that all good things which exist are the fruitsof originality, let them modest enough to believe that there is somethingstill left for it to accomplish, and assure themselves that they are more inneed of originality, the less they are conscious of the want. In sober truth, whatever homage may be professed, or even paid, to real or supposed mental superiority, the general tendency of thingsthroughout the world is to render mediocrity the ascendant power amongmankind. In ancient history, in the Middle Ages, and in a diminishingdegree through the long transition from feudality to the present time, theindividual was a power in himself; and if he had either great talents or ahigh social position, he was a considerable power. At present individu-als are lost in the crowd. In politics it is almost a triviality to say thatpublic opinion now rules the world. The only power deserving the nameis that of masses, and of governments while they make themselves theorgan of the tendencies and instincts of masses. This is as true in themoral and social of private life as in public transactions. Those whoseopinions go by the name of public opinion are not always the same sort62/John Stuart Mill of public: in America they are the whole white population; in England, chiefly the middle class. But they are always a mass, that is to say,collective mediocrity. And what is a still greater novelty, the mass donot now take their opinions from dignitaries in Church or State, fromostensible leaders, or from books. Their thinking is done for them bymen much like themselves, addressing them or speaking in their name,on the spur of the moment, through the newspapers. I am not complaining of all this. I do not assert that anything better is compatible, as a general rule, with the present low state of the humanmind. But that does not hinder the government of mediocrity from beingmediocre government. No government by a democracy or a numerousaristocracy, either in its political acts or in the opinions, qualities, andtone of mind which it fosters, ever did or could rise above mediocrity,except in so far as the sovereign Many have let themselves be guided(which in their best times they always have done) by the counsels andinfluence of a more highly gifted and instructed One or Few. The initia-tion of all wise or noble things comes and must come from individuals;generally at first from some one individual. The honour and glory of theaverage man is that he is capable of following that initiative; that he canrespond internally to wise and noble things, and be led to them with hiseyes open. I am not countenancing the sort of \"hero-worship\" whichapplauds the strong man of genius for forcibly seizing on the govern-ment of the world and making it do his bidding in spite of itself. All hecan claim is, freedom to point out the way. The power of compellingothers into it is not only inconsistent with the freedom and developmentof all the rest, but corrupting to the strong man himself. It does seem,however, that when the opinions of masses of merely average men areeverywhere become or becoming the dominant power, the counterpoiseand corrective to that tendency would be the more and more pronouncedindividuality of those who stand on the higher eminences of thought. Itis in these circumstances most especially, that exceptional individuals,instead of being deterred, should be encouraged in acting differentlyfrom the mass. In other times there was no advantage in their doing so,unless they acted not only differently but better. In this age, the mereexample of non-conformity, the mere refusal to bend the knee to custom,is itself a service. Precisely because the tyranny of opinion is such as tomake eccentricity a reproach, it is desirable, in order to break throughthat tyranny, that people should be eccentric. Eccentricity has alwaysabounded when and where strength of character has abounded; and theOn Liberty/63 amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and moral courage it contained.That so few now dare to be eccentric marks the chief danger of the time. I have said that it is important to give the freest scope possible to uncustomary things, in order that it may in time appear which of theseare fit to be converted into customs. But independence of action, anddisregard of custom, are not solely deserving of encouragement for thechance they afford that better modes action, and customs more worthyof general adoption, may be struck out; nor is it only persons of decidedmental superiority who have a just claim to carry on their lives in theirown way. There is no reason that all human existence should be con-structed on some one or some small number of patterns. If a personpossesses any tolerable amount of common sense and experience, hisown mode of laying out his existence is the best, not because it is thebest in itself, but because it is his own mode. Human beings are not likesheep; and even sheep are not undistinguishably alike. A man cannot geta coat or a pair of boots to fit him unless they are either made to hismeasure, or he has a whole warehouseful to choose from: and is it easierto fit him with a life than with a coat, or are human beings more like oneanother in their whole physical and spiritual conformation than in theshape of their feet? If it were only that people have diversities of taste,that is reason enough for not attempting to shape them all after onemodel. But different persons also require different conditions for their spiri- tual development; and can no more exist healthily in the same moral,than all the variety of plants can in the same physical, atmosphere andclimate. The same things which are helps to one person towards thecultivation of his higher nature are hindrances to another. The samemode of life is a healthy excitement to one, keeping all his faculties ofaction and enjoyment in their best order, while to another it is a distract-ing burthen, which suspends or crushes all internal life. Such are thedifferences among human beings in their sources of pleasure, their sus-ceptibilities of pain, and the operation on them of different physical andmoral agencies, that unless there is a corresponding diversity in theirmodes of life, they neither obtain their fair share of happiness, nor growup to the mental, moral, and aesthetic stature of which their nature iscapable. Why then should tolerance, as far as the public sentiment isconcerned, extend only to tastes and modes of life which extort acquies-cence by the multitude of their adherents? Nowhere (except in some64/John Stuart Mill monastic institutions) is diversity of taste entirely unrecognised; a per- son may, without blame, either like or dislike rowing, or smoking, ormusic, or athletic exercises, or chess, or cards, or study, because boththose who like each of these things, and those who dislike them, are toonumerous to be put down. But the man, and still more the woman, whocan be accused either of doing \"What nobody does,\" or of not doing\"what everybody does,\" is the subject of as much depreciatory remarkas if he or she had committed some grave moral delinquency. Personsrequire to possess a title, or some other badge of rank, or of the consid-eration of people of rank, to be able to indulge somewhat in the luxuryof doing as they like without detriment to their estimation. To indulgesomewhat, I repeat: for whoever allow themselves much of that indul-gence, incur the risk of something worse than disparaging speeches\u2014they are in peril of a commission de lunatico , and of having their prop- erty taken from them and given to their relations. 8 There is one characteristic of the present direction of public opinion peculiarly calculated to make it intolerant of any marked demonstrationof individuality. The general average of mankind are not only moderatein intellect, but also moderate in inclinations: they have no tastes orwishes strong enough to incline them to do anything unusual, and theyconsequently do not understand those who have, and class all such withthe wild and intemperate whom they are accustomed to look down upon.Now, in addition to this fact which is general, we have only to supposethat a strong movement has set in towards the improvement of morals,and it is evident what we have to expect. In these days such a movementhas set in; much has actually been effected in the way of increased regu-larity of conduct and discouragement of excesses; and there is a philan-thropic spirit abroad, for the exercise of which there is no more invitingfield than the moral and prudential improvement of our fellow crea-tures. These tendencies of the times cause the public to be more dis-posed than at most former periods to prescribe general rules of conduct,and endeavour to make every one conform to the approved standard.And that standard, express or tacit, is to desire nothing strongly. Itsideal of character is to be without any marked character; to maim bycompression, like a Chinese lady's foot, every part of human naturewhich stands out prominently, and tends to make the person markedlydissimilar in outline to commonplace humanity. As is usually the case with ideals which exclude one-half of what is desirable, the present standard of approbation produces only an inferiorOn Liberty/65 imitation of the other half. Instead of great energies guided by vigorous reason, and strong feelings strongly controlled by a conscientious will,its result is weak feelings and weak energies, which therefore can bekept in outward conformity to rule without any strength either of will orof reason. Already energetic characters on any large scale are becomingmerely traditional. There is now scarcely any outlet for energy in thiscountry except business. The energy expended in this may still be re-garded as considerable. What little is left from that employment is ex-pended on some hobby; which may be a useful, even a philanthropichobby, but is always some one thing, and generally a thing of smalldimensions. The greatness of England is now all collective; individuallysmall, we only appear capable of anything great by our habit of combin-ing; and with this our moral and religious philanthropists are perfectlycontented. But it was men of another stamp than this that made Englandwhat it has been; and men of another stamp will be needed to prevent itsdecline. The despotism of custom is everywhere the standing hindrance to human advancement, being in unceasing antagonism to that dispositionto aim at something better than customary, which is called, according tocircumstances, the spirit of liberty, or that of progress or improvement.The spirit of improvement is not always a spirit of liberty, for it mayaim at forcing improvements on an unwilling people; and the spirit ofliberty, in so far as it resists such attempts, may ally itself locally andtemporarily with the opponents of improvement; but the only unfailingand permanent source of improvement is liberty, since by it there are asmany possible independent centres of improvement as there are indi-viduals. The progressive principle, however, in either shape, whether asthe love of liberty or of improvement, is antagonistic to the sway ofCustom, involving at least emancipation from that yoke; and the contestbetween the two constitutes the chief interest of the history of mankind.The greater part of the world has, properly speaking, no history, be-cause the despotism of Custom is complete. This is the case over thewhole East. Custom is there, in all things, the final appeal; justice andright mean conformity to custom; the argument of custom no one, un-less tyrant intoxicated with power, thinks of resisting. And we see theresult. Those nations must once have had originality; they did not startout of the ground populous, lettered, and versed in many of the arts oflife; they made themselves all this, and were then the greatest and mostpowerful nations of the world. What are they now? The subjects or66/John Stuart Mill dependents of tribes whose forefathers wandered in the forests when theirs had magnificent palaces and gorgeous temples, but over whomcustom exercised only a divided rule with liberty and progress. A people, it appears, may be progressive for a certain length of time, and then stop: when does it stop? When it ceases to possess indi-viduality. If a similar change should befall the nations of Europe, it willnot be in exactly the same shape: the despotism of custom with whichthese nations are threatened is not precisely stationariness. It proscribessingularity, but it does not preclude change, provided all change to-gether. We have discarded the fixed costumes of our forefathers; everyone must still dress like other people, but the fashion may change onceor twice a year. We thus take care that when there is a change, it shall befor change's sake, and not from any idea of beauty or convenience; forthe same idea of beauty or convenience would not strike all the world atthe same moment, and be simultaneously thrown aside by all at anothermoment. But we are progressive as well as changeable: we continuallymake new inventions in mechanical things, and keep them until they areagain superseded by better; we are eager for improvement in politics, ineducation, even in morals, though in this last our idea of improvementchiefly consists in persuading or forcing other people to be as good asourselves. It is not progress that we object to; on the contrary, we flatterourselves that we are the most progressive people who ever lived. It isindividuality that we war against: we should think we had done wondersif we had made ourselves all alike; forgetting that the unlikeness of oneperson to another is generally the first thing which draws the attentionof either to the imperfection of his own type, and the superiority ofanother, or the possibility, by combining the advantages of both, of pro-ducing something better than either. We have a warning example inChina\u2014a nation of much talent, and, in some respects, even wisdom,owing to the rare good fortune of having been provided at an early pe-riod with a particularly good set of customs, the work, in some measure,of men to whom even the most enlightened European must accord, un-der certain limitations, the title of sages and philosophers. They areremarkable, too, in the excellence of their apparatus for impressing, asfar as possible, the best wisdom they possess upon every mind in thecommunity, and securing that those who have appropriated most of itshall occupy the posts of honour and power. Surely the people who didthis have discovered the secret of human progressiveness, and must havekept themselves steadily at the head of the movement of the world. OnOn Liberty/67 the contrary, they have become stationary\u2014have remained so for thou- sands of years; and if they are ever to be farther improved, it must be byforeigners. They have succeeded beyond all hope in what English phi-lanthropists are so industriously working at\u2014in making a people allalike, all governing their thoughts and conduct by the same maxims andrules; and these are the fruits. The modern regime of public opinion is,in an unorganised form, what the Chinese educational and political sys-tems are in an organised; and unless individuality shall be able success-fully to assert itself against this yoke, Europe, notwithstanding its nobleantecedents and its professed Christianity, will tend to become anotherChina. What is it that has hitherto preserved Europe from this lot? What has made the European family of nations an improving, instead of astationary portion of mankind? Not any superior excellence in them,which, when it exists, exists as the effect not as the cause; but theirremarkable diversity of character and culture. Individuals, classes, na-tions, have been extremely unlike one another: they have struck out agreat variety of paths, each leading to something valuable; and althoughat every period those who travelled in different paths have been intoler-ant of one another, and each would have thought it an excellent thing ifall the rest could have been compelled to travel his road, their attemptsto thwart each other's development have rarely had any permanent suc-cess, and each has in time endured to receive the good which the othershave offered. Europe is, in my judgment, wholly indebted to this plural-ity of paths for its progressive and many-sided development. But it al-ready begins to possess this benefit in a considerably less degree. It isdecidedly advancing towards the Chinese ideal of making all peoplealike. M. de Tocqueville, in his last important work, remarks how muchmore the Frenchmen of the present day resemble one another than didthose even of the last generation. The same remark might be made ofEnglishmen in a far greater degree. In a passage already quoted from Wilhelm von Humboldt, he points out two things as necessary conditions of human development, becausenecessary to render people unlike one another; namely, freedom, andvariety of situations. The second of these two conditions is in this coun-try every day diminishing. The circumstances which surround differentclasses and individuals, and shape their characters, are daily becomingmore assimilated. Formerly different ranks, different neighbourhoods,different trades and professions, lived in what might be called different68/John Stuart Mill worlds; at present to a great degree in the same. Comparatively speak- ing, they now read the same things, listen to the same things, see thesame things, go to the same places, have their hopes and fears directedto the same objects, have the same rights and liberties, and the samemeans of asserting them. Great as are the differences of position whichremain, they are nothing to those which have ceased. And the assimila-tion is still proceeding. All the political changes of the age promote it,since they all tend to raise the low and to lower the high. Every exten-sion of education promotes it, because education brings people undercommon influences, and gives them access to the general stock of factsand sentiments. Improvement in the means of communication promotesit, by bringing the inhabitants of distant places into personal contact,and keeping up a rapid flow of changes of residence between one placeand another. The increase of commerce and manufactures promotes it,by diffusing more widely the advantages of easy circumstances, andopening all objects of ambition, even the highest, to general competi-tion, whereby the desire of rising becomes no longer the character of aparticular class, but of all classes. A more powerful agency than evenall these, in bringing about a general similarity among mankind, is thecomplete establishment, in this and other free countries, of the ascen-dancy of public opinion in the State. As the various social eminenceswhich enabled persons entrenched on them to disregard the opinion ofthe multitude gradually become levelled; as the very idea of resisting thewill of the public, when it is positively known that they have a will,disappears more and more from the minds of practical politicians; thereceases to be any social support for nonconformity\u2014any substantivepower in society which, itself opposed to the ascendancy of numbers, isinterested in taking under its protection opinions and tendencies at vari-ance with those of the public. The combination of all these causes forms so great a mass of influ- ences hostile to Individuality, that it is not easy to see how it can standits ground. It will do so with increasing difficulty, unless the intelligentpart of the public can be made to feel its value\u2014to see that it is goodthere should be differences, even though not for the better, even though,as it may appear to them, some should be for the worse. If the claims ofIndividuality are ever to be asserted, the time is now, while much is stillwanting to complete the enforced assimilation. It is only in the earlierstages that any stand can be successfully made against the encroach-ment. The demand that all other people shall resemble ourselves growsOn Liberty/69 by what it feeds on. If resistance waits till life is reduced nearly to one uniform type, all deviations from that type will come to be consideredimpious, immoral, even monstrous and contrary to nature. Mankindspeedily become unable to conceive diversity, when they have been forsome time unaccustomed to see it. Chapter 4.Of the Limits to the Authority of Society over theIndividual. What, then, is the rightful limit to the sovereignty of the individual overhimself? Where does the authority of society begin? How much of hu-man life should be assigned to individuality, and how much to society? Each will receive its proper share, if each has that which more par- ticularly concerns it. To individuality should belong the part of life inwhich it is chiefly the individual that is interested; to society, the partwhich chiefly interests society. Though society is not founded on a contract, and though no good purpose is answered by inventing a contract in order to deduce socialobligations from it, every one who receives the protection of societyowes a return for the benefit, and the fact of living in society renders itindispensable that each should be bound to observe a certain line ofconduct towards the rest. This conduct consists, first, in not injuring theinterests of one another; or rather certain interests, which, either byexpress legal provision or by tacit understanding, ought to be consid-ered as rights; and secondly, in each person's bearing his share (to befixed on some equitable principle) of the labours and sacrifices incurredfor defending the society or its members from injury and molestation.These conditions society is justified in enforcing, at all costs to thosewho endeavour to withhold fulfilment. Nor is this all that society maydo. The acts of an individual may be hurtful to others, or wanting in dueconsideration for their welfare, without going to the length of violatingany of their constituted rights. The offender may then be justly punishedby opinion, though not by law. As soon as any part of a person's con-duct affects prejudicially the interests of others, society has jurisdictionover it, and the question whether the general welfare will or will not bepromoted by interfering with it, becomes open to discussion. But thereis no room for entertaining any such question when a person's conductaffects the interests of no persons besides himself, or needs not affect70/John Stuart Mill them unless they like (all the persons concerned being of full age, and the ordinary amount of understanding). In all such cases, there shouldbe perfect freedom, legal and social, to do the action and stand the con-sequences. It would be a great misunderstanding of this doctrine to suppose that it is one of selfish indifference, which pretends that human beingshave no business with each other's conduct in life, and that they shouldnot concern themselves about the well-doing or well-being of one an-other, unless their own interest is involved. Instead of any diminution,there is need of a great increase of disinterested exertion to promote thegood of others. But disinterested benevolence can find other instrumentsto persuade people to their good than whips and scourges, either of theliteral or the metaphorical sort. I am the last person to undervalue theself-regarding virtues; they are only second in importance, if even sec-ond, to the social. It is equally the business of education to cultivateboth. But even education works by conviction and persuasion as well asby compulsion, and it is by the former only that, when the period ofeducation is passed, the self-regarding virtues should be inculcated.Human beings owe to each other help to distinguish the better from theworse, and encouragement to choose the former and avoid the latter.They should be for ever stimulating each other to increased exercise oftheir higher faculties, and increased direction of their feelings and aimstowards wise instead of foolish, elevating instead of degrading, objectsand contemplations. But neither one person, nor any number of persons,is warranted in saying to another human creature of ripe years, that heshall not do with his life for his own benefit what he chooses to do withit. He is the person most interested in his own well-being: the interestwhich any other person, except in cases of strong personal attachment,can have in it, is trifling, compared with that which he himself has; theinterest which society has in him individually (except as to his conductto others) is fractional, and altogether indirect; while with respect to hisown feelings and circumstances, the most ordinary man or woman hasmeans of knowledge immeasurably surpassing those that can be pos-sessed by any one else. The interference of society to overrule his judg-ment and purposes in what only regards himself must be grounded ongeneral presumptions; which may be altogether wrong, and even if right,are as likely as not to be misapplied to individual cases, by persons nobetter acquainted with the circumstances of such cases than those arewho look at them merely from without. In this department, therefore, ofOn Liberty/71 human affairs, Individuality has its proper field of action. In the con- duct of human beings towards one another it is necessary that generalrules should for the most part be observed, in order that people mayknow what they have to expect: but in each person's own concerns hisindividual spontaneity is entitled to free exercise. Considerations to aidhis judgment, exhortations to strengthen his will, may be offered to him,even obtruded on him, by others: but he himself is the final judge. Allerrors which he is likely to commit against advice and warning are faroutweighed by the evil of allowing others to constrain him to what theydeem his good. I do not mean that the feelings with which a person is regarded by others ought not to be in any way affected by his self-regarding qualitiesor deficiencies. This is neither possible nor desirable. If he is eminent inany of the qualities which conduce to his own good, he is, so far, aproper object of admiration. He is so much the nearer to the ideal per-fection of human nature. If he is grossly deficient in those qualities, asentiment the opposite of admiration will follow. There is a degree offolly, and a degree of what may be called (though the phrase is notunobjectionable) lowness or depravation of taste, which, though it can-not justify doing harm to the person who manifests it, renders him nec-essarily and properly a subject of distaste, or, in extreme cases, even ofcontempt: a person could not have the opposite qualities in due strengthwithout entertaining these feelings. Though doing no wrong to any one,a person may so act as to compel us to judge him, and feel to him, as afool, or as a being of an inferior order: and since this judgment andfeeling are a fact which he would prefer to avoid, it is doing him aservice to warn him of it beforehand, as of any other disagreeable con-sequence to which he exposes himself. It would be well, indeed, if thisgood office were much more freely rendered than the common notionsof politeness at present permit, and if one person could honestly pointout to another that he thinks him in fault, without being considered un-mannerly or presuming. We have a right, also, in various ways, to actupon our unfavourable opinion of any one, not to the oppression of hisindividuality, but in the exercise of ours. We are not bound, for ex-ample, to seek his society; we have a right to avoid it (though not toparade the avoidance), for we have a right to choose the society mostacceptable to us. We have a right, and it may be our duty, to cautionothers against him, if we think his example or conversation likely tohave a pernicious effect on those with whom he associates. We may give72/John Stuart Mill others a preference over him in optional good offices, except those which tend to his improvement. In these various modes a person may suffervery severe penalties at the hands of others for faults which directlyconcern only himself; but he suffers these penalties only in so far as theyare the natural and, as it were, the spontaneous consequences of thefaults themselves, not because they are purposely inflicted on him forthe sake of punishment. A person who shows rashness, obstinacy, self-conceit\u2014who cannot live within moderate means\u2014who cannot restrainhimself from hurtful indulgences\u2014who pursues animal pleasures at theexpense of those of feeling and intellect\u2014must expect to be lowered inthe opinion of others, and to have a less share of their favourable senti-ments; but of this he has no right to complain, unless he has meritedtheir favour by special excellence in his social relations, and has thusestablished a title to their good offices, which is not affected by hisdemerits towards himself. What I contend for is, that the inconveniences which are strictly inseparable from the unfavourable judgment of others, are the only onesto which a person should ever be subjected for that portion of his con-duct and character which concerns his own good, but which does notaffect the interest of others in their relations with him. Acts injurious toothers require a totally different treatment. Encroachment on their rights;infliction on them of any loss or damage not justified by his own rights;falsehood or duplicity in dealing with them; unfair or ungenerous use ofadvantages over them; even selfish abstinence from defending themagainst injury\u2014these are fit objects of moral reprobation, and, in gravecases, of moral retribution and punishment. And not only these acts, butthe dispositions which lead to them, are properly immoral, and fit sub-jects of disapprobation which may rise to abhorrence. Cruelty of dispo-sition; malice and ill-nature; that most anti-social and odious of all pas-sions, envy; dissimulation and insincerity, irascibility on the provocation; the love ofdomineering over others; the desire to engross more than one's share ofadvantages (the pleonexia of the Greeks); the pride which derives grati-fication from the abasement of others; the egotism which thinks self andits concerns more important than everything else, and decides all doubt-ful questions in its own favour;\u2014these are moral vices, and constitute abad and odious moral character: unlike the self-regarding faults previ-ously mentioned, which are not properly immoralities, and to whateverpitch they may be carried, do not constitute wickedness. They may beOn Liberty/73 proofs of any amount of folly, or want of personal dignity and self- respect; but they are only a subject of moral reprobation when theyinvolve a breach of duty to others, for whose sake the individual isbound to have care for himself. What are called duties to ourselves arenot socially obligatory, unless circumstances render them at the sametime duties to others. The term duty to oneself, when it means anythingmore than prudence, means self-respect or self-development, and fornone of these is any one accountable to his fellow creatures, because fornone of them is it for the good of mankind that he be held accountable tothem. The distinction between the loss of consideration which a person may rightly incur by defect of prudence or of personal dignity, and thereprobation which is due to him for an offence against the rights ofothers, is not a merely nominal distinction. It makes a vast differenceboth in our feelings and in our conduct towards him whether he dis-pleases us in things in which we think we have a right to control him, orin things in which we know that we have not. If he displeases us, wemay express our distaste, and we may stand aloof from a person as wellas from a thing that displeases us; but we shall not therefore feel calledon to make his life uncomfortable. We shall reflect that he already bears,or will bear, the whole penalty of his error; if he spoils his life by mis-management, we shall not, for that reason, desire to spoil it still further:instead of wishing to punish him, we shall rather endeavour to alleviatehis punishment, by showing him how he may avoid or cure the evils hisconduct tends to bring upon him. He may be to us an object of pity,perhaps of dislike, but not of anger or resentment; we shall not treat himlike an enemy of society: the worst we shall think ourselves justified indoing is leaving him to himself, if we do not interfere benevolently byshowing interest or concern for him. It is far otherwise if he has in-fringed the rules necessary for the protection of his fellow creatures,individually or collectively. The evil consequences of his acts do notthen fall on himself, but on others; and society, as the protector of all itsmembers, must retaliate on him; must inflict pain on him for the expresspurpose of punishment, and must take care that it be sufficiently severe.In the one case, he is an offender at our bar, and we are called on notonly to sit in judgment on him, but, in one shape or another, to executeour own sentence: in the other case, it is not our part to inflict anysuffering on him, except what may incidentally follow from our usingthe same liberty in the regulation of our own affairs, which we allow to74/John Stuart Mill him in his. The distinction here pointed out between the part of a person's life which concerns only himself, and that which concerns others, manypersons will refuse to admit. How (it may be asked) can any part of theconduct of a member of society be a matter of indifference to the othermembers? No person is an entirely isolated being; it is impossible for aperson to do anything seriously or permanently hurtful to himself, with-out mischief reaching at least to his near connections, and often farbeyond them. If he injures his property, he does harm to those whodirectly or indirectly derived support from it, and usually diminishes, bya greater or less amount, the general resource; of the community. If hedeteriorates his bodily or mental faculties, he not only brings evil uponall who depended on him for any portion of their happiness, but dis-qualifies himself for rendering the services which he owes to his fellowcreatures generally; perhaps becomes a burthen on their affection orbenevolence; and if such conduct were very frequent, hardly any of-fence that is committed would detract more from the general sum ofgood. Finally, if by his vices or follies a person does no direct harm toothers, he is nevertheless (it may be said) injurious by his example; andought to be compelled to control himself, for the sake of those whom thesight or knowledge of his conduct might corrupt or mislead. And even (it will be added) if the consequences of misconduct could be confined to the vicious or thoughtless individual, ought society toabandon to their own guidance those who are manifestly unfit for it? Ifprotection against themselves is confessedly due to children and personsunder age, is not society equally bound to afford it to persons of matureyears who are equally incapable of self-government? If gambling, ordrunkenness, or incontinence, or idleness, or uncleanliness, are as inju-rious to happiness, and as great a hindrance to improvement, as manyor most of the acts prohibited by law, why (it may be asked) should notlaw, so far as is consistent with practicability and social convenience,endeavour to repress these also? And as a supplement to the unavoid-able imperfections of law, ought not opinion at least to organise a pow-erful police against these vices, and visit rigidly with social penaltiesthose who are known to practise them? There is no question here (it maybe said) about restricting individuality, or impeding the trial of new andoriginal experiments in living. The only things it is sought to prevent arethings which have been tried and condemned from the beginning of theworld until now; things which experience has shown not to be useful orOn Liberty/75 suitable to any person's individuality. There must be some length of time and amount of experience after which a moral or prudential truthmay be regarded as established: and it is merely desired to prevent gen-eration after generation from falling over the same precipice which hasbeen fatal to their predecessors. I fully admit that the mischief which a person does to himself may seriously affect, both through their sympathies and their interests, thosenearly connected with him and, in a minor degree, society at large. When,by conduct of this sort, a person is led to violate a distinct and assign-able obligation to any other person or persons, the case is taken out ofthe self-regarding class, and becomes amenable to moral disapproba-tion in the proper sense of the term. If, for example, a man, throughintemperance or extravagance, becomes unable to pay his debts, or,having undertaken the moral responsibility of a family, becomes fromthe same cause incapable of supporting or educating them, he is deserv-edly reprobated, and might be justly punished; but it is for the breach ofduty to his family or creditors, not for the extravagance. If the resourceswhich ought to have been devoted to them, had been diverted from themfor the most prudent investment, the moral culpability would have beenthe same. George Barnwell murdered his uncle to get money for hismistress, but if he had done it to set himself up in business, he wouldequally have been hanged. Again, in the frequent case of a man whocauses grief to his family by addiction to bad habits, he deserves re-proach for his unkindness or ingratitude; but so he may for cultivatinghabits not in themselves vicious, if they are painful to those with whomhe passes his life, who from personal ties are dependent on him for theircomfort. Whoever fails in the consideration generally due to the inter-ests and feelings of others, not being compelled by some more impera-tive duty, or justified by allowable self-preference, is a subject of moraldisapprobation for that failure, but not for the cause of it, nor for theerrors, merely personal to himself, which may have remotely led to it. Inlike manner, when a person disables himself, by conduct purely self-regarding, from the performance of some definite duty incumbent onhim to the public, he is guilty of a social offence. No person ought to bepunished simply for being drunk; but a soldier or a policeman should bepunished for being drunk on duty. Whenever, in short, there is a definitedamage, or a definite risk of damage, either to an individual or to thepublic, the case is taken out of the province of liberty, and placed in thatof morality or law.76/John Stuart Mill But with regard to the merely contingent, or, as it may be called, constructive injury which a person causes to society, by conduct whichneither violates any specific duty to the public, nor occasions percep-tible hurt to any assignable individual except himself; the inconvenienceis one which society can afford to bear, for the sake of the greater goodof human freedom. If grown persons are to be punished for not takingproper care of themselves, I would rather it were for their own sake,than under pretence of preventing them from impairing their capacity orrendering to society benefits which society does not pretend it has aright to exact. But I cannot consent to argue the point as if society hadno means of bringing its weaker members up to its ordinary standard ofrational conduct, except waiting till they do something irrational, andthen punishing them, legally or morally, for it. Society has had absolutepower over them during all the early portion of their existence: it hashad the whole period of childhood and nonage in which to try whether itcould make them capable of rational conduct in life. The existing gen-eration is master both of the training and the entire circumstances of thegeneration to come; it cannot indeed make them perfectly wise and good,because it is itself so lamentably deficient in goodness and wisdom; andits best efforts are not always, in individual cases, its most successfulones; but it is perfectly well able to make the rising generation, as awhole, as good as, and a little better than, itself. If society lets anyconsiderable number of its members grow up mere children, incapableof being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, societyhas itself to blame for the consequences. Armed not only with all thepowers of education, but with the ascendency which the authority of areceived opinion always exercises over the minds who are least fitted tojudge for themselves; and aided by the natural penalties which cannotbe prevented from falling on those who incur the distaste or the con-tempt of those who know them; let not society pretend that it needs,besides all this, the power to issue commands and enforce obedience inthe personal concerns of individuals, in which, on all principles of jus-tice and policy, the decision ought to rest with those who are to abide theconsequences. Nor is there anything which tends more to discredit and frustrate the better means of influencing conduct than a resort to the worse. Ifthere be among those whom it is attempted to coerce into prudence ortemperance any of the material of which vigorous and independent char-acters are made, they will infallibly rebel against the yoke. No suchOn Liberty/77 person will ever feel that others have a right to control him in his con- cerns, such as they have to prevent him from injuring them in theirs; andit easily comes to be considered a mark of spirit and courage to fly in theface of such usurped authority, and do with ostentation the exact oppo-site of what it enjoins; as in the fashion of grossness which succeeded, inthe time of Charles II., to the fanatical moral intolerance of the Puritans.With respect to what is said of the necessity of protecting society fromthe bad example set to others by the vicious or the self-indulgent; it istrue that bad example may have a pernicious effect, especially the ex-ample of doing wrong to others with impunity to the wrong-doer. Butwe are now speaking of conduct which, while it does no wrong to oth-ers, is supposed to do great harm to the agent himself: and I do not seehow those who believe this can think otherwise than that the example,on the whole, must be more salutary than hurtful, since, if it displays themisconduct, it displays also the painful or degrading consequences which,if the conduct is justly censured, must be supposed to be in all or mostcases attendant on it. But the strongest of all the arguments against the interference of the public with purely personal conduct is that, when it does interfere, theodds are that it interferes wrongly, and in the wrong place. On questionsof social morality, of duty to others, the opinion of the public, that is, ofan overruling majority, though of wrong, is likely to be still oftenerright; because on such questions they are only required to judge of theirown interests; of the manner in which some mode of conduct, if allowedto be practised, would effect themselves. But the opinion of a similarmajority, imposed as a law on the minority, on questions of self-regard-ing conduct, is quite as likely to be wrong as right; for in these casespublic opinion means, at the best, some people's opinion of what is goodor bad for other people; while very of it does not even mean that; thepublic, with the most perfect indifference, passing over the pleasure orconvenience of those whose conduct they censure, and considering onlytheir own preference. There are many who consider as an injury to them-selves any conduct which they have a distaste for, and resent it as anoutrage to their feelings; as a religious bigot, when charged with disre-garding the religious feelings of others, has been known to retort thatthey disregard his feelings, by persisting in their abominable worship orcreed. But there is no parity between the feeling of a person for his ownopinion, and the feeling of another who is offended at his holding it; nomore than between the desire of a thief to take a purse, and the desire of78/John Stuart Mill the right owner to keep it. And a person's taste is as much his own peculiar concern as his opinion or his purse. It is easy for any one toimagine an ideal public which leaves the freedom and choice of indi-viduals in all uncertain matters undisturbed, and only requires them toabstain from modes of conduct which universal experience has con-demned. But where has there been seen a public which set any such limitto its censorship? or when does the public trouble itself about universalexperience? In its interferences with personal conduct it is seldom think-ing of anything but the enormity of acting or feeling differently fromitself; and this standard of judgment, thinly disguised, is held up to man-kind as the dictate of religion and philosophy, by nine-tenths of all mor-alists and speculative writers. These teach that things are right becausethey are right; because we feel them to be so. They tell us to search inour own minds and hearts for laws of conduct binding on ourselves andon all others. What can the poor public do but apply these instructions,and make their own personal feelings of good and evil, if they are toler-ably unanimous in them, obligatory on all the world? The evil here pointed out is not one which exists only in theory; and it may perhaps be expected that I should specify the instances in whichthe public of this age and country improperly invests its own prefer-ences with the character of moral laws. I am not writing an essay on theaberrations of existing moral feeling. That is too weighty a subject to bediscussed parenthetically, and by way of illustration. Yet examples arenecessary to show that the principle I maintain is of serious and practi-cal moment, and that I am not endeavouring to erect a barrier againstimaginary evils. And it is not difficult to show, by abundant instances,that to extend the bounds of what may be called moral police, until itencroaches on the most unquestionably legitimate liberty of the indi-vidual, is one of the most universal of all human propensities. As a first instance, consider the antipathies which men cherish on no better grounds than that persons whose religious opinions are differ-ent from theirs do not practise their religious observances, especiallytheir religious abstinences. To cite a rather trivial example, nothing inthe creed or practice of Christians does more to envenom the hatred ofMahomedans against them than the fact of their eating pork. There arefew acts which Christians and Europeans regard with more unaffecteddisgust than Mussulmans regard this particular mode of satisfying hun-ger. It is, in the first place, an offence against their religion; but thiscircumstance by no means explains either the degree or the kind of theirOn Liberty/79 repugnance; for wine also is forbidden by their religion, and to partake of it is by all Mussulmans accounted wrong, but not disgusting. Theiraversion to the flesh of the \"unclean beast\" is, on the contrary, of thatpeculiar character, resembling an instinctive antipathy, which the ideaof uncleanness, when once it thoroughly sinks into the feelings, seemsalways to excite even in those whose personal habits are anything butscrupulously cleanly, and of which the sentiment of religious impurity,so intense in the Hindoos, is a remarkable example. Suppose now that ina people, of whom the majority were Mussulmans, that majority shouldinsist upon not permitting pork to be eaten within the limits of the coun-try. This would be nothing new in Mahomedan countries. 9 Would it be a legitimate exercise of the moral authority of public opinion? and if not,why not? The practice is really revolting to such a public. They alsosincerely think that it is forbidden and abhorred by the Deity. Neithercould the prohibition be censured as religious persecution. It might bereligious in its origin, but it would not be persecution for religion, sincenobody's religion makes it a duty to eat pork. The only tenable groundof condemnation would be that with the personal tastes and self-regard-ing concerns of individuals the public has no business to interfere. To come somewhat nearer home: the majority of Spaniards con- sider it a gross impiety, offensive in the highest degree to the SupremeBeing, to worship him in any other manner than the Roman Catholic;and no other public worship is lawful on Spanish soil. The people of allSouthern Europe look upon a married clergy as not only irreligious, butunchaste, indecent, gross, disgusting. What do Protestants think of theseperfectly sincere feelings, and of the attempt to enforce them againstnon-Catholics? Yet, if mankind are justified in interfering with eachother's liberty in things which do not concern the interests of others, onwhat principle is it possible consistently to exclude these cases? or whocan blame people for desiring to suppress what they regard as a scandalin the sight of God and man? No stronger case can be shown for prohib-iting anything which is regarded as a personal immorality, than is madeout for suppressing these practices in the eyes of those who regard themas impieties; and unless we are willing to adopt the logic of persecutors,and to say that we may persecute others because we are right, and thatthey must not persecute us because they are wrong, we must beware ofadmitting a principle of which we should resent as a gross injustice theapplication to ourselves. The preceding instances may be objected to, although unreason-80/John Stuart Mill ably, as drawn from contingencies impossible among us: opinion, in this country, not being likely to enforce abstinence from meats, or to inter-fere with people for worshipping, and for either marrying or not marry-ing, according to their creed or inclination. The next example, however,shall be taken from an interference with liberty which we have by nomeans passed all danger of. Wherever the Puritans have been suffi-ciently powerful, as in New England, and in Great Britain at the time ofthe Commonwealth, they have endeavoured, with considerable success,to put down all public, and nearly all private, amusements: especiallymusic, dancing, public games, or other assemblages for purposes ofdiversion, and the theatre. There are still in this country large bodies ofpersons by whose notions of morality and religion these recreations arecondemned; and those persons belonging chiefly to the middle class,who are the ascendant power in the present social and political condi-tion of the kingdom, it is by no means impossible that persons of thesesentiments may at some time or other command a majority in Parlia-ment. How will the remaining portion of the community like to have theamusements that shall be permitted to them regulated by the religiousand moral sentiments of the stricter Calvinists and Methodists? Wouldthey not, with considerable peremptoriness, desire these intrusively pi-ous members of society to mind their own business? This is preciselywhat should be said to every government and every public, who havethe pretension that no person shall enjoy any pleasure which they thinkwrong. But if the principle of the pretension be admitted, no one canreasonably object to its being acted on in the sense of the majority, orother preponderating power in the country; and all persons must be readyto conform to the idea of a Christian commonwealth, as understood bythe early settlers in New England, if a religious profession similar totheirs should ever succeed in regaining its lost ground, as religions sup-posed to be declining have so often been known to do. To imagine another contingency, perhaps more likely to be realised than the one last mentioned. There is confessedly a strong tendency inthe modern world towards a democratic constitution of society, accom-panied or not by popular political institutions. It is affirmed that in thecountry where this tendency is most completely realised- where bothsociety and the government are most democratic\u2014the United States\u2014the feeling of the majority, to whom any appearance of a more showy orcostly style of living than they can hope to rival is disagreeable, oper-ates as a tolerably effectual sumptuary law, and that in many parts ofOn Liberty/81 the Union it is really difficult for a person possessing a very large in- come to find any mode of spending it which will not incur popular dis-approbation. Though such statements as these are doubtless much ex-aggerated as a representation of existing facts, the state of things theydescribe is not only a conceivable and possible, but a probable result ofdemocratic feeling, combined with the notion that the public has a rightto a veto on the manner in which individuals shall spend their incomes.We have only further to suppose a considerable diffusion of Socialistopinions, and it may become infamous in the eyes of the majority topossess more property than some very small amount, or any income notearned by manual labour. Opinions similar in principle to these alreadyprevail widely among the artisan class, and weigh oppressively on thosewho are amenable to the opinion chiefly of that class, namely, its ownmembers. It is known that the bad workmen who form the majority ofthe operatives in many branches of industry, are decidedly of opinionthat bad workmen ought to receive the same wages as good, and that noone ought to be allowed, through piecework or otherwise, to earn bysuperior skill or industry more than others can without it. And theyemploy a moral police, which occasionally becomes a physical one, todeter skilful workmen from receiving, and employers from giving, alarger remuneration for a more useful service. If the public have anyjurisdiction over private concerns, I cannot see that these people are infault, or that any individual's particular public can be blamed for as-serting the same authority over his individual conduct which the generalpublic asserts over people in general. But, without dwelling upon supposititious cases, there are, in our own day, gross usurpations upon the liberty of private life actually prac-tised, and still greater ones threatened with some expectation of success,and opinions propounded which assert an unlimited right in the publicnot only to prohibit by law everything which it thinks wrong, but, inorder to get at what it thinks wrong, to prohibit a number of thingswhich it admits to be innocent. Under the name of preventing intemperance, the people of one En- glish colony, and of nearly half the United States, have been interdictedby law from making any use whatever of fermented drinks, except formedical purposes: for prohibition of their sale is in fact, as it is intendedto be, prohibition of their use. And though the impracticability of ex-ecuting the law has caused its repeal in several of the States which hadadopted it, including the one from which it derives its name, an attempt82/John Stuart Mill has notwithstanding been commenced, and is prosecuted with consider- able zeal by many of the professed philanthropists, to agitate for a simi-lar law in this country. The association, or \"Alliance\" as it terms itself,which has been formed for this purpose, has acquired some notorietythrough the publicity given to a correspondence between its secretaryand one of the very few English public men who hold that a politician'sopinions ought to be founded on principles. Lord Stanley's share in thiscorrespondence is calculated to strengthen the hopes already built onhim, by those who know how rare such qualities as are manifested insome of his public appearances unhappily are among those who figurein political life. The organ of the Alliance, who would \"deeply deplorethe recognition of any principle which could be wrested to justify big-otry and persecution,\" undertakes to point out the \"broad and impass-able barrier\" which divides such principles from those of the associa-tion. \"All matters relating to thought, opinion, conscience, appear tome,\" he says, \"to be without the sphere of legislation; all pertaining tosocial act, habit, relation, subject only to a discretionary power vestedin the State itself, and not in the individual, to be within it.\" No mention is made of a third class, different from either of these, viz., acts and habits which are not social, but individual; although it isto this class, surely, that the act of drinking fermented liquors belongs.Selling fermented liquors, however, is trading, and trading is a socialact. But the infringement complained of is not on the liberty of the seller,but on that of the buyer and consumer; since the State might just as wellforbid him to drink wine as purposely make it impossible for him toobtain it. The secretary, however, says, \"I claim, as a citizen, a right tolegislate whenever my social rights are invaded by the social act of an-other.\" And now for the definition of these \"social rights.\" \"If anythinginvades my social rights, certainly the traffic in strong drink does. Itdestroys my primary right of security, by constantly creating and stimu-lating social disorder. It invades my right of equality, by deriving a profitfrom the creation of a misery I am taxed to support. It impedes my rightto free moral and intellectual development, by surrounding my path withdangers, and by weakening and demoralising society, from which I havea right to claim mutual aid and intercourse.\" A theory of \"social rights\"the like of which probably never before found its way into distinct lan-guage: being nothing short of this\u2014that it is the absolute social right ofevery individual, that every other individual shall act in every respectexactly as he ought; that whosoever fails thereof in the smallest particu-On Liberty/83 lar violates my social right, and entitles me to demand from the legisla- ture the removal of the grievance. So monstrous a principle is far moredangerous than any single interference with liberty; there is no violationof liberty which it would not justify; it acknowledges no right to anyfreedom whatever, except perhaps to that of holding opinions in secret,without ever disclosing them: for, the moment an opinion which I con-sider noxious passes any one's lips, it invades all the \"social rights\"attributed to me by the Alliance. The doctrine ascribes to all mankind avested interest in each other's moral, intellectual, and even physical per-fection, to be defined by each claimant according to his own standard. Another important example of illegitimate interference with the right- ful liberty of the individual, not simply threatened, but long since car-ried into triumphant effect, is Sabbatarian legislation. Without doubt,abstinence on one day in the week, so far as the exigencies of life permit,from the usual daily occupation, though in no respect religiously bind-ing on any except Jews, is a highly beneficial custom. And inasmuch asthis custom cannot be observed without a general consent to that effectamong the industrious classes, therefore, in so far as some persons byworking may impose the same necessity on others, it may be allowableand right that the law should guarantee to each the observance by othersof the custom, by suspending the greater operations of industry on aparticular day. But this justification, grounded on the direct interest whichothers have in each individual's observance of the practice, does notapply to the self-chosen occupations in which a person may think fit toemploy his leisure; nor does it hold good, in the smallest degree, forlegal restrictions on amusements. It is true that the amusement of someis the day's work of others; but the pleasure, not to say the useful recre-ation, of many, is worth the labour of a few, provided the occupation isfreely chosen, and can be freely resigned. The operatives are perfectlyright in thinking that if all worked on Sunday, seven days' work wouldhave to be given for six days' wages; but so long as the great mass ofemployments are suspended, the small number who for the enjoyment ofothers must still work, obtain a proportional increase of earnings; andthey are not obliged to follow those occupations if they prefer leisure toemolument. If a further remedy is sought, it might be found in the estab-lishment by custom of a holiday on some other day of the week for thoseparticular classes of persons. The only ground, therefore, on which re-strictions on Sunday amusements can be defended, must be that they arereligiously wrong; a motive of legislation which can never be too ear-84/John Stuart Mill nestly protested against. Deorum injuriae Diis curae. It remains to be proved that society or any of its officers holds a commission from onhigh to avenge any supposed offence to Omnipotence, which is not alsoa wrong to our fellow creatures. The notion that it is one man's duty thatanother should be religious, was the foundation of all the religious per-secutions ever perpetrated, and, if admitted, would fully justify them.Though the feeling which breaks out in the repeated attempts to stoprailway travelling on Sunday, in the resistance to the opening of Muse-ums, and the like, has not the cruelty of the old persecutors, the state ofmind indicated by it is fundamentally the same. It is a determination notto tolerate others in doing what is permitted by their religion, because itis not permitted by the persecutor's religion. It is a belief that God notonly abominates the act of the misbeliever, but will not hold us guiltlessif we leave him unmolested. I cannot refrain from adding to these examples of the little account commonly made of human liberty, the language of downright persecu-tion which breaks out from the press of this country whenever it feelscalled on to notice the remarkable phenomenon of Mormonism. Muchmight be said on the unexpected and instructive fact that an alleged newrevelation, and a religion founded on it, the product of palpable impos-ture, not even supported by the prestige of extraordinary qualities in itsfounder, is believed by hundreds of thousands, and has been made thefoundation of a society, in the age of newspapers, railways, and theelectric telegraph. What here concerns us is, that this religion, like otherand better religions, has its martyrs: that its prophet and founder was,for his teaching, put to death by a mob; that others of its adherents losttheir lives by the same lawless violence; that they were forcibly ex-pelled, in a body, from the country in which they first grew up; while,now that they have been chased into a solitary recess in the midst of adesert, many in this country openly declare that it would be right (onlythat it is not convenient) to send an expedition against them, and compelthem by force to conform to the opinions of other people. The article ofthe Mormonite doctrine which is the chief provocative to the antipathywhich thus breaks through the ordinary restraints of religious tolerance,is its sanction of polygamy; which, though permitted to Mahomedans,and Hindoos, and Chinese, seems to excite unquenchable animosity whenpractised by persons who speak English and profess to be a kind ofChristians. No one has a deeper disapprobation than I have of this Mor-mon institution; both for other reasons, and because, far from being inOn Liberty/85 any way countenanced by the principle of liberty, it is a direct infraction of that principle, being a mere riveting of the chains of one half of thecommunity, and an emancipation of the other from reciprocity of obli-gation towards them. Still, it must be remembered that this relation is asmuch voluntary on the part of the women concerned in it, and who maybe deemed the sufferers by it, as is the case with any other form of themarriage institution; and however surprising this fact may appear, ithas its explanation in the common ideas and customs of the world, whichteaching women to think marriage the one thing needful, make it intelli-gible that many woman should prefer being one of several wives, to notbeing a wife at all. Other countries are not asked to recognise suchunions, or release any portion of their inhabitants from their own lawson the score of Mormonite opinions. But when the dissentients haveconceded to the hostile sentiments of others far more than could justlybe demanded; when they have left the countries to which their doctrineswere unacceptable, and established themselves in a remote corner of theearth, which they have been the first to render habitable to human be-ings; it is difficult to see on what principles but those of tyranny theycan be prevented from living there under what laws they please, pro-vided they commit no aggression on other nations, and allow perfectfreedom of departure to those who are dissatisfied with their ways. Arecent writer, in some respects of considerable merit, proposes (to usehis own words) not a crusade, but a civilisade , against this polygamous community, to put an end to what seems to him a retrograde step incivilisation. It also appears so to me, but I am not aware that any com-munity has a right to force another to be civilised. So long as the suffer-ers by the bad law do not invoke assistance from other communities, Icannot admit that persons entirely unconnected with them ought to stepin and require that a condition of things with which all who are directlyinterested appear to be satisfied, should be put an end to because it is ascandal to persons some thousands of miles distant, who have no part orconcern in it. Let them send missionaries, if they please, to preach againstit; and let them, by any fair means (of which silencing the teachers is notone), oppose the progress of similar doctrines among their own people.If civilisation has got the better of barbarism when barbarism had theworld to itself, it is too much to profess to be afraid lest barbarism, afterhaving been fairly got under, should revive and conquer civilisation. Acivilisation that can thus succumb to its vanquished enemy, must firsthave become so degenerate, that neither its appointed priests and teach-86/John Stuart Mill ers, nor anybody else, has the capacity, or will take the trouble, to stand up for it. If this be so, the sooner such a civilisation receives notice toquit the better. It can only go on from bad to worse, until destroyed andregenerated (like the Western Empire) by energetic barbarians. Chapter 5.Applications. The principles asserted in these pages must be more generally admittedas the basis for discussion of details, before a consistent application ofthem to all the various departments of government and morals can beattempted with any prospect of advantage. The few observations I pro-pose to make on questions of detail are designed to illustrate the prin-ciples, rather than to follow them out to their consequences. I offer, notso much applications, as specimens of application; which may serve tobring into greater clearness the meaning and limits of the two maximswhich together form the entire doctrine of this Essay, and to assist thejudgment in holding the balance between them, in the cases where itappears doubtful which of them is applicable to the case. The maxims are, first, that the individual is not accountable to soci- ety for his actions, in so far as these concern the interests of no personbut himself. Advice, instruction, persuasion, and avoidance by otherpeople if thought necessary by them for their own good, are the onlymeasures by which society can justifiably express its dislike or disap-probation of his conduct. Secondly, that for such actions as are prejudi-cial to the interests of others, the individual is accountable, and may besubjected either to social or to legal punishment, if society is of opinionthat the one or the other is requisite for its protection. In the first place, it must by no means be supposed, because dam- age, or probability of damage, to the interests of others, can alone jus-tify the interference of society, that therefore it always does justify suchinterference. In many cases, an individual, in pursuing a legitimate ob-ject, necessarily and therefore legitimately causes pain or loss to others,or intercepts a good which they had a reasonable hope of obtaining.Such oppositions of interest between individuals often arise from badsocial institutions, but are unavoidable while those institutions last; andsome would be unavoidable under any institutions. Whoever succeedsin an overcrowded profession, or in a competitive examination; who-ever is preferred to another in any contest for an object which bothdesire, reaps benefit from the loss of others, from their wasted exertionOn Liberty/87 and their disappointment. But it is, by common admission, better for the general interest of mankind, that persons should pursue their objectsundeterred by this sort of consequences. In other words, society admitsno right, either legal or moral, in the disappointed competitors to immu-nity from this kind of suffering; and feels called on to interfere, onlywhen means of success have been employed which it is contrary to thegeneral interest to permit\u2014namely, fraud or treachery, and force. Again, trade is a social act. Whoever undertakes to sell any descrip- tion of goods to the public, does what affects the interest of other per-sons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comeswithin the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be theduty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance,to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture. But it is nowrecognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapnessand the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided forby leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole checkof equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. Thisis the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds differentfrom, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty as-serted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for pur-poses of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, qua restraint, is anevil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct whichsociety is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely because they donot really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. Asthe principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of FreeTrade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting thelimits of that doctrine; as, for example, what amount of public control isadmissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitaryprecautions, or arrangements to protect workpeople employed in dan-gerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questionsinvolve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people tothemselves is always better, caeteris paribus , than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends is in principleundeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to interfer-ence with trade which are essentially questions of liberty; such as theMaine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation ofopium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, inshort, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible ordifficult to obtain a particular commodity. These interferences are ob-88/John Stuart Mill jectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer. One of these examples, that of the sale of poisons, opens a new question; the proper limits of what may be called the functions of police;how far liberty may legitimately be invaded for the prevention of crime,or of accident. It is one of the undisputed functions of government totake precautions against crime before it has been committed, as well asto detect and punish it afterwards. The preventive function of govern-ment, however, is far more liable to be abused, to the prejudice of lib-erty, than the punitory function;\u2014for there is hardly any part of thelegitimate freedom of action of a human being which would not admit ofbeing represented, and fairly too, as increasing the facilities for someform or other of delinquency. Nevertheless, if a public authority, or evena private person, sees any one evidently preparing to commit a crime,they are not bound to look on inactive until the crime is committed, butmay interfere to prevent it. If poisons were never bought or used for anypurpose except the commission of murder it would be right to prohibittheir manufacture and sale. They may, however, be wanted not only forinnocent but for useful purposes, and restrictions cannot be imposed inthe one case without operating in the other. Again, it is a proper office ofpublic authority to guard against accidents. If either a public officer orany one else saw a person attempting to cross a bridge which had beenascertained to be unsafe, and there were no time to warn him of hisdanger, they might seize him and turn him back, without any real in-fringement of his liberty; for liberty consists in doing what one desires,and he does not desire to fall into the river. Nevertheless, when there isnot a certainty, but only a danger of mischief, no one but the personhimself can judge of the sufficiency of the motive which may prompthim to incur the risk: in this case, therefore (unless he is a child, ordelirious, or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible withthe full use of the reflecting faculty), he ought, I conceive, to be onlywarned of the danger; not forcibly prevented from exposing himself toit. Similar considerations, applied to such a question as the sale of poi-sons, may enable us to decide which among the possible modes of regu-lation are or are not contrary to principle. Such a precaution, for ex-ample, as that of labelling the drug with some word expressive of itsdangerous character, may be enforced without violation of liberty: thebuyer cannot wish not to know that the thing he possesses has poison-ous qualities. But to require in all cases the certificate of a medicalOn Liberty/89 practitioner would make it sometimes impossible, always expensive, to obtain the article for legitimate uses. The only mode apparent to me, in which difficulties may be thrown in the way of crime committed through this means, without any infringe-ment worth taking into account upon the liberty of those who desire thepoisonous substance for other purposes, consists in providing what, inthe apt language of Bentham, is called \"preappointed evidence.\" Thisprovision is familiar to every one in the case of contracts. It is usual andright that the law, when a contract is entered into, should require as thecondition of its enforcing performance, that certain formalities shouldbe observed, such as signatures, attestation of witnesses, and the like, inorder that in case of subsequent dispute there may be evidence to provethat the contract was really entered into, and that there was nothing inthe circumstances to render it legally invalid: the effect being to throwgreat obstacles in the way of fictitious contracts, or contracts made incircumstances which, if known, would destroy their validity. Precau-tions of a similar nature might be enforced in the sale of articles adaptedto be instruments of crime. The seller, for example, might be required toenter in a register the exact time of the transaction, the name and ad-dress of the buyer, the precise quality and quantity sold; to ask the pur-pose for which it was wanted, and record the answer he received. Whenthere was no medical prescription, the presence of some third personmight be required, to bring home the fact to the purchaser, in case thereshould afterwards be reason to believe that the article had been appliedto criminal purposes. Such regulations would in general be no materialimpediment to obtaining the article, but a very considerable one to mak-ing an improper use of it without detection. The right inherent in society, to ward off crimes against itself by antecedent precautions, suggests the obvious limitations to the maxim,that purely self-regarding misconduct cannot properly be meddled within the way of prevention or punishment. Drunkenness, for example, inordinary cases, is not a fit subject for legislative interference; but I shoulddeem it perfectly legitimate that a person, who had once been convictedof any act of violence to others under the influence of drink, should beplaced under a special legal restriction, personal to himself; that if hewere afterwards found drunk, he should be liable to a penalty, and thatif when in that state he committed another offence, the punishment towhich he would be liable for that other offence should be increased inseverity. The making himself drunk, in a person whom drunkenness ex-90/John Stuart Mill cites to do harm to others, is a crime against others. So, again, idleness, except in a person receiving support from the public, or except when itconstitutes a breach of contract, cannot without tyranny be made a sub-ject of legal punishment; but if, either from idleness or from any otheravoidable cause, a man fails to perform his legal duties to others, as forinstance to support his children, it is no tyranny to force him to fulfilthat obligation, by compulsory labour, if no other means are available. Again, there are many acts which, being directly injurious only to the agents themselves, ought not to be legally interdicted, but which, ifdone publicly, are a violation of good manners, and coming thus withinthe category of offences against others, may rightly be prohibited. Ofthis kind are offences against decency; on which it is unnecessary todwell, the rather as they are only connected indirectly with our subject,the objection to publicity being equally strong in the case of many ac-tions not in themselves condemnable, nor supposed to be so. There is another question to which an answer must be found, con- sistent with the principles which have been laid down. In cases of per-sonal conduct supposed to be blamable, but which respect for libertyprecludes society from preventing or punishing, because the evil di-rectly resulting falls wholly on the agent; what the agent is free to do,ought other persons to be equally free to counsel or instigate? This ques-tion is not free from difficulty. The case of a person who solicits anotherto do an act is not strictly a case of self-regarding conduct. To giveadvice or offer inducements to any one is a social act, and may, there-fore, like actions in general which affect others, be supposed amenableto social control. But a little reflection corrects the first impression, byshowing that if the case is not strictly within the definition of individualliberty, yet the reasons on which the principle of individual liberty isgrounded are applicable to it. If people must be allowed, in whateverconcerns only themselves, to act as seems best to themselves, at theirown peril, they must equally be free to consult with one another aboutwhat is fit to be so done; to exchange opinions, and give and receivesuggestions. Whatever it is permitted to do, it must be permitted to ad-vise to do. The question is doubtful only when the instigator derives apersonal benefit from his advice; when he makes it his occupation, forsubsistence or pecuniary gain, to promote what society and the Stateconsider to be an evil. Then, indeed, a new element of complication isintroduced; namely, the existence of classes of persons with an interestopposed to what is considered as the public weal, and whose mode ofOn Liberty/91 living is grounded on the counteraction of it. Ought this to be interfered with, or not? Fornication, for example, must be tolerated, and so mustgambling; but should a person be free to be a pimp, or to keep a gam-bling-house? The case is one of those which lie on the exact boundaryline between two principles, and it is not at once apparent to which ofthe two it properly belongs. There are arguments on both sides. On the side of toleration it may be said that the fact of following anything as an occupation, and livingor profiting by the practice of it, cannot make that criminal which wouldotherwise be admissible; that the act should either be consistently per-mitted or consistently prohibited; that if the principles which we havehitherto defended are true, society has no business, as society, to decideanything to be wrong which concerns only the individual; that it cannotgo beyond dissuasion, and that one person should be as free to persuadeas another to dissuade. In opposition to this it may be contended, thatalthough the public, or the State, are not warranted in authoritativelydeciding, for purposes of repression or punishment, that such or suchconduct affecting only the interests of the individual is good or bad, theyare fully justified in assuming, if they regard it as bad, that its being soor not is at least a disputable question: That, this being supposed, theycannot be acting wrongly in endeavouring to exclude the influence ofsolicitations which are not disinterested, of instigators who cannot pos-sibly be impartial\u2014who have a direct personal interest on one side, andthat side the one which the State believes to be wrong, and who confess-edly promote it for personal objects only. There can surely, it may beurged, be nothing lost, no sacrifice of good, by so ordering matters thatpersons shall make their election, either wisely or foolishly, on their ownprompting, as free as possible from the arts of persons who stimulatetheir inclinations for interested purposes of their own. Thus (it may besaid) though the statutes respecting unlawful games are utterly indefen-sible\u2014though all persons should be free to gamble in their own or eachother's houses, or in any place of meeting established by their own sub-scriptions, and open only to the members and their visitors\u2014yet publicgambling-houses should not be permitted. It is true that the prohibitionis never effectual, and that, whatever amount of tyrannical power maybe given to the police, gambling-houses can always be maintained underother pretences; but they may be compelled to conduct their operationswith a certain degree of secrecy and mystery, so that nobody knowsanything about them but those who seek them; and more than this soci-92/John Stuart Mill ety ought not to aim at. There is considerable force in these arguments. I will not venture to decide whether they are sufficient to justify the moral anomaly of pun-ishing the accessary, when the principal is (and must be) allowed to gofree; of fining or imprisoning the procurer, but not the fornicator\u2014thegambling-house keeper, but not the gambler. Still less ought the com-mon operations of buying and selling to be interfered with on analogousgrounds. Almost every article which is bought and sold may be used inexcess, and the sellers have a pecuniary interest in encouraging thatexcess; but no argument can be founded on this, in favour, for instance,of the Maine Law; because the class of dealers in strong drinks, thoughinterested in their abuse, are indispensably required for the sake of theirlegitimate use. The interest, however, of these dealers in promoting in-temperance is a real evil, and justifies the State in imposing restrictionsand requiring guarantees which, but for that justification, would be in-fringements of legitimate liberty. A further question is, whether the State, while it permits, should nevertheless indirectly discourage conduct which it deems contrary tothe best interests of the agent; whether, for example, it should take mea-sures to render the means of drunkenness more costly, or add to thedifficulty of procuring them by limiting the number of the places of sale.On this as on most other practical questions, many distinctions requireto be made. To tax stimulants for the sole purpose of making them moredifficult to be obtained, is a measure differing only in degree from theirentire prohibition; and would be justifiable only if that were justifiable.Every increase of cost is a prohibition, to those whose means do notcome up to the augmented price; and to those who do, it is a penalty laidon them for gratifying a particular taste. Their choice of pleasures, andtheir mode of expending their income, after satisfying their legal andmoral obligations to the State and to individuals, are their own concern,and must rest with their own judgment. These considerations may seemat first sight to condemn the selection of stimulants as special subjectsof taxation for purposes of revenue. But it must be remembered thattaxation for fiscal purposes is absolutely inevitable; that in most coun-tries it is necessary that a considerable part of that taxation should beindirect; that the State, therefore, cannot help imposing penalties, whichto some persons may be prohibitory, on the use of some articles of con-sumption. It is hence the duty of the State to consider, in the impositionof taxes, what commodities the consumers can best spare; and a for-On Liberty/93 tiori, to select in preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate quantity, to be positively injurious. Taxation, therefore,of stimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount ofrevenue (supposing that the State needs all the revenue which it yields)is not only admissible, but to be approved of. The question of making the sale of these commodities a more or less exclusive privilege, must be answered differently, according to the pur-poses to which the restriction is intended to be subservient. All places ofpublic resort require the restraint of a police, and places of this kindpeculiarly, because offences against society are especially apt to origi-nate there. It is, therefore, fit to confine the power of selling these com-modities (at least for consumption on the spot) to persons of known orvouched-for respectability of conduct; to make such regulations respect-ing hours of opening and closing as may be requisite for public surveil-lance, and to withdraw the licence if breaches of the peace repeatedlytake place through the connivance or incapacity of the keeper of thehouse, or if it becomes a rendezvous for concocting and preparing of-fences against the law. Any further restriction I do not conceive to be, inprinciple, justifiable. The limitation in number, for instance, of beer andspirit houses, for the express purpose of rendering them more difficultof access, and diminishing the occasions of temptation, not only ex-poses all to an inconvenience because there are some by whom the facil-ity would be abused, but is suited only to a state of society in which thelabouring classes are avowedly treated as children or savages, and placedunder an education of restraint, to fit them for future admission to theprivileges of freedom. This is not the principle on which the labouringclasses are professedly governed in any free country; and no personwho sets due value on freedom will give his adhesion to their being sogoverned, unless after all efforts have been exhausted to educate themfor freedom and govern them as freemen, and it has been definitivelyproved that they can only be governed as children. The bare statementof the alternative shows the absurdity of supposing that such effortshave been made in any case which needs be considered here. It is onlybecause the institutions of this country are a mass of inconsistencies,that things find admittance into our practice which belong to the systemof despotic, or what is called paternal, government, while the generalfreedom of our institutions precludes the exercise of the amount of con-trol necessary to render the restraint of any real efficacy as a moraleducation.94/John Stuart Mill It was pointed out in an early part of this Essay, that the liberty of the individual, in things wherein the individual is alone concerned, im-plies a corresponding liberty in any number of individuals to regulate bymutual agreement such things as regard them jointly, and regard nopersons but themselves. This question presents no difficulty, so long asthe will of all the persons implicated remains unaltered; but since thatwill may change, it is often necessary, even in things in which they aloneare concerned, that they should enter into engagements with one an-other; and when they do, it is fit, as a general rule, that those engage-ments should be kept. Yet, in the laws, probably, of every country, thisgeneral rule has some exceptions. Not only persons are not held to en-gagements which violate the rights of third parties, but it is sometimesconsidered a sufficient reason for releasing them from an engagement,that it is injurious to themselves. In this and most other civilised coun-tries, for example, an engagement by which a person should sell him-self, or allow himself to be sold, as a slave, would be null and void;neither enforced by law nor by opinion. The ground for thus limiting hispower of voluntarily disposing of his own lot in life, is apparent, and isvery clearly seen in this extreme case. The reason for not interfering,unless for the sake of others, with a person's voluntary acts, is consider-ation for his liberty. His voluntary choice is evidence that what he sochooses is desirable, or at least endurable, to him, and his good is on thewhole best provided for by allowing him to take his own means of pur-suing it. But by selling himself for a slave, be abdicates his liberty; heforegoes any future use of it beyond that single act. He therefore de-feats, in his own case, the very purpose which is the justification ofallowing him to dispose of himself. He is no longer free; but is thence-forth in a position which has no longer the presumption in its favour,that would be afforded by his voluntarily remaining in it. The principleof freedom cannot require that he should be free not to be free. It is notfreedom to be allowed to alienate his freedom. These reasons, the forceof which is so conspicuous in this peculiar case, are evidently of farwider application; yet a limit is everywhere set to them by the necessi-ties of life, which continually require, not indeed that we should resignour freedom, but that we should consent to this and the other limitationof it. The principle, however, which demands uncontrolled freedom ofaction in all that concerns only the agents themselves, requires that thosewho have become bound to one another, in things which concern nothird party, should be able to release one another from the engagement:On Liberty/95 and even without such voluntary release there are perhaps no contracts or engagements, except those that relate to money or money's worth, ofwhich one can venture to say that there ought to be no liberty whateverof retractation. Baron Wilhelm von Humboldt, in the excellent essay from which I have already quoted, states it as his conviction, that engagements whichinvolve personal relations or services should never be legally bindingbeyond a limited duration of time; and that the most important of theseengagements, marriage, having the peculiarity that its objects are frus-trated unless the feelings of both the parties are in harmony with it,should require nothing more than the declared will of either party todissolve it. This subject is too important, and too complicated, to bediscussed in a parenthesis, and I touch on it only so far as is necessaryfor purposes of illustration. If the conciseness and generality of BaronHumboldt's dissertation had not obliged him in this instance to contenthimself with enunciating his conclusion without discussing the premises,he would doubtless have recognised that the question cannot be decidedon grounds so simple as those to which he confines himself. When aperson, either by express promise or by conduct, has encouraged an-other to rely upon his continuing to act in a certain way\u2014to build ex-pectations and calculations, and stake any part of his plan of life uponthat supposition\u2014a new series of moral obligations arises on his parttowards that person, which may possibly be overruled, but cannot beignored. And again, if the relation between two contracting parties hasbeen followed by consequences to others; if it has placed third parties inany peculiar position, or, as in the case of marriage, has even calledthird parties into existence, obligations arise on the part of both thecontracting parties towards those third persons, the fulfilment of which,or at all events the mode of fulfilment, must be greatly affected by thecontinuance or disruption of the relation between the original parties tothe contract. It does not follow, nor can I admit, that these obligationsextend to requiring the fulfilment of the contract at all costs to the hap-piness of the reluctant party; but they are a necessary element in thequestion; and even if, as Von Humboldt maintains, they ought to makeno difference in the legal freedom of the parties to release themselvesfrom the engagement (and I also hold that they ought not to make muchdifference), they necessarily make a great difference in the moral free-dom. A person is bound to take all these circumstances into accountbefore resolving on a step which may affect such important interests of96/John Stuart Mill others; and if he does not allow proper weight to those interests, he is morally responsible for the wrong. I have made these obvious remarksfor the better illustration of the general principle of liberty, and not be-cause they are at all needed on the particular question, which, on thecontrary, is usually discussed as if the interest of children was every-thing, and that of grown persons nothing. I have already observed that, owing to the absence of any recognised general principles, liberty is often granted where it should be withheld,as well as withheld where it should be granted; and one of the cases inwhich, in the modern European world, the sentiment of liberty is thestrongest, is a case where, in my view, it is altogether misplaced. Aperson should be free to do as he likes in his own concerns; but he oughtnot to be free to do as he likes in acting for another, under the pretextthat the affairs of the other are his own affairs. The State, while it re-spects the liberty of each in what specially regards himself, is bound tomaintain a vigilant control over his exercise of any power which it al-lows him to possess over others. This obligation is almost entirely disre-garded in the case of the family relations, a case, in its direct influenceon human happiness, more important than all others taken together. Thealmost despotic power of husbands over wives needs not be enlargedupon here, because nothing more is needed for the complete removal ofthe evil than that wives should have the same rights, and should receivethe protection of law in the same manner, as all other persons; and be-cause, on this subject, the defenders of established injustice do not availthemselves of the plea of liberty, but stand forth openly as the champi-ons of power. It is in the case of children that misapplied notions ofliberty are a real obstacle to the fulfilment by the State of its duties. Onewould almost think that a man's children were supposed to be literally,and not metaphorically, a part of himself, so jealous is opinion of thesmallest interference of law with his absolute and exclusive control overthem; more jealous than of almost any interference with his own free-dom of action: so much less do the generality of mankind value libertythan power. Consider, for example, the case of education. Is it not al-most a self-evident axiom, that the State should require and compel theeducation, up to a certain standard, of every human being who is bornits citizen? Yet who is there that is not afraid to recognise and assert thistruth? Hardly any one indeed will deny that it is one of the most sacredduties of the parents (or, as law and usage now stand, the father), aftersummoning a human being into the world, to give to that being an edu-On Liberty/97 cation fitting him to perform his part well in life towards others and towards himself. But while this is unanimously declared to be the father'sduty, scarcely anybody, in this country, will bear to hear of obliging himto perform it. Instead of his being required to make any exertion orsacrifice for securing education to his child, it is left to his choice toaccept it or not when it is provided gratis! It still remains unrecognised,that to bring a child into existence without a fair prospect of being able,not only to provide food for its body, but instruction and training for itsmind, is a moral crime, both against the unfortunate offspring and againstsociety; and that if the parent does not fulfil this obligation, the Stateought to see it fulfilled, at the charge, as far as possible, of the parent. Were the duty of enforcing universal education once admitted there would be an end to the difficulties about what the State should teach,and how it should teach, which now convert the subject into a merebattlefield for sects and parties, causing the time and labour which shouldhave been spent in educating to be wasted in quarreling about educa-tion. If the government would make up its mind to require for everychild a good education, it might save itself the trouble of providing one.It might leave to parents to obtain the education where and how theypleased, and content itself with helping to pay the school fees of thepoorer classes of children, and defraying the entire school expenses ofthose who have no one else to pay for them. The objections which areurged with reason against State education do not apply to the enforce-ment of education by the State, but to the State's taking upon itself todirect that education; which is a totally different thing. That the wholeor any large part of the education of the people should be in State hands,I go as far as any one in deprecating. All that has been said of theimportance of individuality of character, and diversity in opinions andmodes of conduct, involves, as of the same unspeakable importance,diversity of education. A general State education is a mere contrivancefor moulding people to be exactly like one another: and as the mould inwhich it casts them is that which pleases the predominant power in thegovernment, whether this be a monarch, a priesthood, an aristocracy, orthe majority of the existing generation; in proportion as it is efficientand successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading bynatural tendency to one over the body. An education established andcontrolled by the State should only exist, if it exist at all, as one amongmany competing experiments, carried on for the purpose of exampleand stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard of excellence.98/John Stuart Mill Unless, indeed, when society in general is in so backward a state that it could not or would not provide for itself any proper institutions of edu-cation unless the government undertook the task: then, indeed, the gov-ernment may, as the less of two great evils, take upon itself the businessof schools and universities, as it may that of joint stock companies,when private enterprise, in a shape fitted for undertaking great works ofindustry, does not exist in the country. But in general, if the countrycontains a sufficient number of persons qualified to provide educationunder government auspices, the same persons would be able and willingto give an equally good education on the voluntary principle, under theassurance of remuneration afforded by a law rendering education com-pulsory, combined with State aid to those unable to defray the expense. The instrument for enforcing the law could be no other than public examinations, extending to all children, and beginning at an early age.An age might be fixed at which every child must be examined, to ascer-tain if he (or she) is able to read. If a child proves unable, the father,unless he has some sufficient ground of excuse, might be subjected to amoderate fine, to be worked out, if necessary, by his labour, and thechild might be put to school at his expense. Once in every year theexamination should be renewed, with a gradually extending range ofsubjects, so as to make the universal acquisition, and what is more,retention, of a certain minimum of general knowledge virtually compul-sory. Beyond that minimum there should be voluntary examinations onall subjects, at which all who come up to a certain standard of profi-ciency might claim a certificate. To prevent the State from exercising,through these arrangements, an improper influence over opinion, theknowledge required for passing an examination (beyond the merely in-strumental parts of knowledge, such as languages and their use) should,even in the higher classes of examinations, be confined to facts andpositive science exclusively. The examinations on religion, politics, orother disputed topics, should not turn on the truth or falsehood of opin-ions, but on the matter of fact that such and such an opinion is held, onsuch grounds, by such authors, or schools, or churches. Under this system, the rising generation would be no worse off in regard to all disputed truths than they are at present; they would bebrought up either churchmen or dissenters as they now are, the Statemerely taking care that they should be instructed churchmen, or instructeddissenters. There would be nothing to hinder them from being taughtreligion, if their parents chose, at the same schools where they wereOn Liberty/99 taught other things. All attempts by the State to bias the conclusions of its citizens on disputed subjects are evil; but it may very properly offerto ascertain and certify that a person possesses the knowledge requisiteto make his conclusions, on any given subject, worth attending to. Astudent of philosophy would be the better for being able to stand anexamination both in Locke and in Kant, whichever of the two he takesup with, or even if with neither: and there is no reasonable objection toexamining an atheist in the evidences of Christianity, provided he is notrequired to profess a belief in them. The examinations, however, in thehigher branches of knowledge should, I conceive, be entirely voluntary.It would be giving too dangerous a power to governments were theyallowed to exclude any one from professions, even from the professionof teacher, for alleged deficiency of qualifications: and I think, withWilhelm von Humboldt, that degrees, or other public certificates of sci-entific or professional acquirements, should be given to all who presentthemselves for examination, and stand the test; but that such certificatesshould confer no advantage over competitors other than the weight whichmay be attached to their testimony by public opinion. It is not in the matter of education only that misplaced notions of liberty prevent moral obligations on the part of parents from beingrecognised, and legal obligations from being imposed, where there arethe strongest grounds for the former always, and in many cases for thelatter also. The fact itself, of causing the existence of a human being, isone of the most responsible actions in the range of human life. To under-take this responsibility\u2014to bestow a life which may be either a curse ora blessing\u2014unless the being on whom it is to be bestowed will have atleast the ordinary chances of a desirable existence, is a crime againstthat being. And in a country either over-peopled, or threatened withbeing so, to produce children, beyond a very small number, with theeffect of reducing the reward of labour by their competition, is a seriousoffence against all who live by the remuneration of their labour. Thelaws which, in many countries on the Continent, forbid marriage unlessthe parties can show that they have the means of supporting a family, donot exceed the legitimate powers of the State: and whether such laws beexpedient or not (a question mainly dependent on local circumstancesand feelings), they are not objectionable as violations of liberty. Suchlaws are interferences of the State to prohibit a mischievous act\u2014an actinjurious to others, which ought to be a subject of reprobation, andsocial stigma, even when it is not deemed expedient to superadd legal100/John Stuart Mill punishment. Yet the current ideas of liberty, which bend so easily to real infringements of the freedom of the individual in things which concernonly himself, would repel the attempt to put any restraint upon his incli-nations when the consequence of their indulgence is a life or lives ofwretchedness and depravity to the offspring, with manifold evils to thosesufficiently within reach to be in any way affected by their actions.When we compare the strange respect of mankind for liberty, with theirstrange want of respect for it, we might imagine that a man had anindispensable right to do harm to others, and no right at all to pleasehimself without giving pain to any one. I have reserved for the last place a large class of questions respect- ing the limits of government interference, which, though closely con-nected with the subject of this Essay, do not, in strictness, belong to it.These are cases in which the reasons against interference do not turnupon the principle of liberty: the question is not about restraining theactions of individuals, but about helping them; it is asked whether thegovernment should do, or cause to be done, something for their benefit,instead of leaving it to be done by themselves, individually or in volun-tary combination. The objections to government interference, when it is not such as to involve infringement of liberty, may be of three kinds. The first is, when the thing to be done is likely to be better done by individuals than by the government. Speaking generally, there is no oneso fit to conduct any business, or to determine how or by whom it shallbe conducted, as those who are personally interested in it. This principlecondemns the interferences, once so common, of the legislature, or theofficers of government, with the ordinary processes of industry. But thispart of the subject has been sufficiently enlarged upon by political econo-mists, and is not particularly related to the principles of this Essay. The second objection is more nearly allied to our subject. In many cases, though individuals may not do the particular thing so well, on theaverage, as the officers of government, it is nevertheless desirable that itshould be done by them, rather than by the government, as a means totheir own mental education\u2014a mode of strengthening their active facul-ties, exercising their judgment, and giving them a familiar knowledge ofthe subjects with which they are thus left to deal. This is a principal,though not the sole, recommendation of jury trial (in cases not politi-cal); of free and popular local and municipal institutions; of the conductof industrial and philanthropic enterprises by voluntary associations.On Liberty/101 These are not questions of liberty, and are connected with that subject only by remote tendencies; but they are questions of development. Itbelongs to a different occasion from the present to dwell on these thingsas parts of national education; as being, in truth, the peculiar training ofa citizen, the practical part of the political education of a free people,taking them out of the narrow circle of personal and family selfishness,and accustoming them to the comprehension of joint interests, the man-agement of joint concerns\u2014habituating them to act from public or semi-public motives, and guide their conduct by aims which unite instead ofisolating them from one another. Without these habits and powers, afree constitution can neither be worked nor preserved; as is exemplifiedby the too-often transitory nature of political freedom in countries whereit does not rest upon a sufficient basis of local liberties. The manage-ment of purely local business by the localities, and of the great enter-prises of industry by the union of those who voluntarily supply the pe-cuniary means, is further recommended by all the advantages whichhave been set forth in this Essay as belonging to individuality of devel-opment, and diversity of modes of action. Government operations tendto be everywhere alike. With individuals and voluntary associations, onthe contrary, there are varied experiments, and endless diversity of ex-perience. What the State can usefully do is to make itself a central de-pository, and active circulator and diffuser, of the experience resultingfrom many trials. Its business is to enable each experimentalist to ben-efit by the experiments of others; instead of tolerating no experimentsbut its own. The third and most cogent reason for restricting the interference of government is the great evil of adding unnecessarily to its power. Everyfunction superadded to those already exercised by the government causesits influence over hopes and fears to be more widely diffused, and con-verts, more and more, the active and ambitious part of the public intohangers-on of the government, or of some party which aims at becom-ing the government. If the roads, the railways, the banks, the insuranceoffices, the great joint-stock companies, the universities, and the publiccharities, were all of them branches of the government; if, in addition,the municipal corporations and local boards, with all that now devolveson them, became departments of the central administration; if the em-ployes of all these different enterprises were appointed and paid by thegovernment, and looked to the government for every rise in life; not allthe freedom of the press and popular constitution of the legislature would102/John Stuart Mill make this or any other country free otherwise than in name. And the evil would be greater, the more efficiently and scientifically the administra-tive machinery was constructed\u2014the more skilful the arrangements forobtaining the best qualified hands and heads with which to work it. InEngland it has of late been proposed that all the members of the civilservice of government should be selected by competitive examination,to obtain for these employments the most intelligent and instructed per-sons procurable; and much has been said and written for and againstthis proposal. One of the arguments most insisted on by its opponents isthat the occupation of a permanent official servant of the State does nothold out sufficient prospects of emolument and importance to attract thehighest talents, which will always be able to find a more inviting careerin the professions, or in the service of companies and other public bod-ies. One would not have been surprised if this argument had been usedby the friends of the proposition, as an answer to its principal difficulty.Coming from the opponents it is strange enough. What is urged as anobjection is the safety-valve of the proposed system. If indeed all thehigh talent of the country could be drawn into the service of the govern-ment, a proposal tending to bring about that result might well inspireuneasiness. If every part of the business of society which requiredorganised concert, or large and comprehensive views, were in the handsof the government, and if government offices were universally filled bythe ablest men, all the enlarged culture and practised intelligence in thecountry, except the purely speculative, would be concentrated in a nu-merous bureaucracy, to whom alone the rest of the community wouldlook for all things: the multitude for direction and dictation in all theyhad to do; the able and aspiring for personal advancement. To be admit-ted into the ranks of this bureaucracy, and when admitted, to rise therein,would be the sole objects of ambition. Under this regime, not only is theoutside public ill-qualified, for want of practical experience, to criticiseor check the mode of operation of the bureaucracy, but even if the acci-dents of despotic or the natural working of popular institutions occa-sionally raise to the summit a ruler or rulers of reforming inclinations,no reform can be effected which is contrary to the interest of the bureau-cracy. Such is the melancholy condition of the Russian empire, as shown in the accounts of those who have had sufficient opportunity of observa-tion. The Czar himself is powerless against the bureaucratic body; hecan send any one of them to Siberia, but he cannot govern without them,On Liberty/103 or against their will. On every decree of his they have a tacit veto, by merely refraining from carrying it into effect. In countries of more ad-vanced civilisation and of a more insurrectionary spirit, the public, ac-customed to expect everything to be done for them by the State, or atleast to do nothing for themselves without asking from the State notonly leave to do it, but even how it is to be done, naturally hold the Stateresponsible for all evil which befalls them, and when the evil exceedstheir amount of patience, they rise against the government, and makewhat is called a revolution; whereupon somebody else, with or withoutlegitimate authority from the nation, vaults into the seat, issues his or-ders to the bureaucracy, and everything goes on much as it did before;the bureaucracy being unchanged, and nobody else being capable oftaking their place. A very different spectacle is exhibited among a people accustomed to transact their own business. In France, a large part of the people,having been engaged in military service, many of whom have held atleast the rank of non commissioned officers, there are in every popularinsurrection several persons competent to take the lead, and improvisesome tolerable plan of action. What the French are in military affairs,the Americans are in every kind of civil business; let them be left with-out a government, every body of Americans is able to improvise one,and to carry on that or any other public business with a sufficient amountof intelligence, order, and decision. This is what every free people oughtto be: and a people capable of this is certain to be free; it will never letitself be enslaved by any man or body of men because these are able toseize and pull the reins of the central administration. No bureaucracycan hope to make such a people as this do or undergo anything that theydo not like. But where everything is done through the bureaucracy, nothingto which the bureaucracy is really adverse can be done at all. The con-stitution of such countries is an organisation of the experience and prac-tical ability of the nation into a disciplined body for the purpose ofgoverning the rest; and the more perfect that organisation is in itself, themore successful in drawing to itself and educating for itself the personsof greatest capacity from all ranks of the community, the more completeis the bondage of all, the members of the bureaucracy included. For thegovernors are as much the slaves of their organisation and discipline asthe governed are of the governors. A Chinese mandarin is as much thetool and creature of a despotism as the humblest cultivator. An indi-vidual Jesuit is to the utmost degree of abasement the slave of his order,104/John Stuart Mill though the order itself exists for the collective power and importance of its members. It is not, also, to be forgotten, that the absorption of all the principal ability of the country into the governing body is fatal, sooner or later, tothe mental activity and progressiveness of the body itself. Banded to-gether as they are\u2014working a system which, like all systems, necessar-ily proceeds in a great measure by fixed rules\u2014the official body areunder the constant temptation of sinking into indolent routine, or, if theynow and then desert that mill-horse round, of rushing into some half-examined crudity which has struck the fancy of some leading memberof the corps; and the sole check to these closely allied, though seeminglyopposite, tendencies, the only stimulus which can keep the ability of thebody itself up to a high standard, is liability to the watchful criticism ofequal ability outside the body. It is indispensable, therefore, that themeans should exist, independently of the government, of forming suchability, and furnishing it with the opportunities and experience neces-sary for a correct judgment of great practical affairs. If we would pos-sess permanently a skilful and efficient body of functionaries\u2014aboveall, a body able to originate and willing to adopt improvements; if wewould not have our bureaucracy degenerate into a pedantocracy, thisbody must not engross all the occupations which form and cultivate thefaculties required for the government of mankind. To determine the point at which evils, so formidable to human free- dom and advancement, begin, or rather at which they begin to predomi-nate over the benefits attending the collective application of the force ofsociety, under its recognised chiefs, for the removal of the obstacleswhich stand in the way of its well-being; to secure as much of the ad-vantages of centralised power and intelligence as can be had withoutturning into governmental channels too great a proportion of the generalactivity\u2014is one of the most difficult and complicated questions in theart of government. It is, in a great measure, a question of detail, inwhich many and various considerations must be kept in view, and noabsolute rule can be laid down. But I believe that the practical principlein which safety resides, the ideal to be kept in view, the standard bywhich to test all arrangements intended for overcoming the difficulty,may be conveyed in these words: the greatest dissemination of powerconsistent with efficiency; but the greatest possible centralisation of in-formation, and diffusion of it from the centre. Thus, in municipal ad-ministration, there would be, as in the New England States, a very minuteOn Liberty/105 division among separate officers, chosen by the localities, of all busi- ness which is not better left to the persons directly interested; but be-sides this, there would be, in each department of local affairs, a centralsuperintendence, forming a branch of the general government. The or-gan of this superintendence would concentrate, as in a focus, the varietyof information and experience derived from the conduct of that branchof public business in all the localities, from everything analogous whichis done in foreign countries, and from the general principles of politicalscience. This central organ should have a right to know all that is done,and its special duty should be that of making the knowledge acquired inone place available for others. Emancipated from the petty prejudicesand narrow views of a locality by its elevated position and comprehen-sive sphere of observation, its advice would naturally carry much au-thority; but its actual power, as a permanent institution, should, I con-ceive, be limited to compelling the local officers to obey the laws laiddown for their guidance. In all things not provided for by general rules,those officers should be left to their own judgment, under responsibilityto their constituents. For the violation of rules, they should be respon-sible to law, and the rules themselves should be laid down by the legis-lature; the central administrative authority only watching over their ex-ecution, and if they were not properly carried into effect, appealing,according to the nature of the case, to the tribunals to enforce the law, orto the constituencies to dismiss the functionaries who had not executedit according to its spirit. Such, in its general conception, is the central superintendence which the Poor Law Board is intended to exercise over the administrators ofthe Poor Rate throughout the country. Whatever powers the Board ex-ercises beyond this limit were right and necessary in that peculiar case,for the cure of rooted habits of maladministration in matters deeplyaffecting not the localities merely, but the whole community; since nolocality has a moral right to make itself by mismanagement a nest ofpauperism, necessarily overflowing into other localities, and impairingthe moral and physical condition of the whole labouring community.The powers of administrative coercion and subordinate legislation pos-sessed by the Poor Law Board (but which, owing to the state of opinionon the subject, are very scantily exercised by them), though perfectlyjustifiable in a case of first-rate national interest, would be wholly outof place in the superintendence of interests purely local. But a centralorgan of information and instruction for all the localities would be equally106/John Stuart Mill valuable in all departments of administration. A government cannot have too much of the kind of activity which does not impede, but aids andstimulates, individual exertion and development. The mischief beginswhen, instead of calling forth the activity and powers of individuals andbodies, it substitutes its own activity for theirs; when, instead of inform-ing, advising, and, upon occasion, denouncing, it makes them work infetters, or bids them stand aside and does their work instead of them.The worth of a State, in the long run, is the worth of the individualscomposing it; and a State which postpones the interests of their mentalexpansion and elevation to a little more of administrative skill, or of thatsemblance of it which practice gives, in the details of business; a Statewhich dwarfs its men, in order that they may be more docile instrumentsin its hands even for beneficial purposes\u2014will find that with small menno great thing can really be accomplished; and that the perfection ofmachinery to which it has sacrificed everything will in the end avail itnothing, for want of the vital power which, in order that the machinemight work more smoothly, it has preferred to banish. The End Notes 1. These words had scarcely been written, when, as if to give them an emphatic contradiction, occurred the Government Press Prosecutionsof 1858. That ill-judged interference with the liberty of public dis-cussion has not, however, induced me to alter a single word in thetext, nor has it at all weakened my conviction that, moments of panicexcepted, the era of pains and penalties for political discussion has,in our own country, passed away. For, in the first place, the prosecu-tions were not persisted in; and, in the second, they were never, prop-erly speaking, political prosecutions. The offence charged was notthat of criticising institutions, or the acts or persons of rulers, but ofcirculating what was deemed an immoral doctrine, the lawfulness ofTyrannicide. If the arguments of the present chapter are of any validity, there ought to exist the fullest liberty of professing and discussing, as amatter of ethical conviction, any doctrine, however immoral it maybe considered. It would, therefore, be irrelevant and out of place toexamine here, whether the doctrine of Tyrannicide deserves that title.I shall content myself with saying that the subject has been at allOn Liberty/107 times one of the open questions of morals; that the act of a private citizen in striking down a criminal, who, by raising himself above thelaw, has placed himself beyond the reach of legal punishment or con-trol, has been accounted by whole nations, and by some of the bestand wisest of men, not a crime, but an act of exalted virtue; and that,right or wrong, it is not of the nature of assassination, but of civilwar. As such, I hold that the instigation to it, in a specific case, maybe a proper subject of punishment, but only if an overt act has fol-lowed, and at least a probable connection can be established betweenthe act and the instigation. Even then, it is not a foreign government,but the very government assailed, which alone, in the exercise of self-defence, can legitimately punish attacks directed against its own ex-istence. 2.

Ample warning may be drawn from the large infusion of the passions of a persecutor, which mingled with the general display of the worstparts of our national character on the occasion of the Sepoy insurrec-tion. The ravings of fanatics or charlatans from the pulpit may beunworthy of notice; but the heads of the Evangelical party have an-nounced as their principle for the government of Hindoos andMahometans, that no schools be supported by public money in whichthe Bible is not taught, and by necessary consequence that no publicemployment be given to any but real or pretended Christians. AnUnder-Secretary of State, in a speech delivered to his constituents onthe 12th of November, 1857, is reported to have said: \"Toleration oftheir faith\" (the faith of a hundred millions of British subjects), \"thesuperstition which they called religion, by the British Government,had had the effect of retarding the ascendancy of the British name,and preventing the salutary growth of Christianity.... Toleration wasthe great corner-stone of the religious liberties of this country; but donot let them abuse that precious word toleration. As he understood it,it meant the complete liberty to all, freedom of worship, among Chris-tians, who worshipped upon the same foundation. It meant tolerationof all sects and denominations of Christians who believed in the onemediation.\" I desire to call attention to the fact, that a man who has108/John Stuart Mill been deemed fit to fill a high office in the government of this country under a liberal ministry, maintains the doctrine that all who do notbelieve in the divinity of Christ are beyond the pale of toleration.Who, after this imbecile display, can indulge the illusion that reli-gious persecution has passed away, never to return? 6.

There is something both contemptible and frightful in the sort of evidence on which, of late years, any person can be judicially de-clared unfit for the management of his affairs; and after his death, hisdisposal of his property can be set aside, if there is enough of it to paythe expenses of litigation\u2014which are charged on the property itself.All the minute details of his daily life are pried into, and whatever isfound which, seen through the medium of the perceiving and describ-ing faculties of the lowest of the low, bears an appearance unlikeabsolute commonplace, is laid before the jury as evidence of insanity,and often with success; the jurors being little, if at all, less vulgar andignorant than the witnesses; while the judges, with that extraordinarywant of knowledge of human nature and life which continually aston-ishes us in English lawyers, often help to mislead them. These trialsspeak volumes as to the state of feeling and opinion among the vulgarwith regard to human liberty. So far from setting any value on indi-viduality\u2014so far from respecting the right of each individual to act,in things indifferent, as seems good to his own judgment and inclina-tions, judges and juries cannot even conceive that a person in a stateof sanity can desire such freedom. In former days, when it was pro-posed to burn atheists, charitable people used to suggest putting themin a madhouse instead: it would be nothing surprising now-a-dayswere we to see this done, and the doers applauding themselves, be-cause, instead of persecuting for religion, they had adopted so hu-mane and Christian a mode of treating these unfortunates, not with-out a silent satisfaction at their having thereby obtained their deserts. 9. The case of the Bombay Parsees is a curious instance in point. When this industrious and enterprising tribe, the descendants of the Persianfire-worshippers, flying from their native country before the Caliphs,arrived in Western India, they were admitted to toleration by the Hindoosovereigns, on condition of not eating beef. When those regions after-wards fell under the dominion of Mahomedan conquerors, the ParseesOn Liberty/109 obtained from them a continuance of indulgence, on condition of re- fraining from pork. What was at first obedience to authority becamea second nature, and the Parsees to this day abstain both from beefand pork. Though not required by their religion, the double absti-nence has had time to grow into a custom of their tribe; and custom,in the East, is a religion. "}
