Online: Crazy Wisdom Weekly, June 24, 20225 Becoming Me, Again:Becoming Me, Again: The Dance of TransformationThe Dance of Transformation By Megan Sims My greatest gift is that I lead with the heart. Like a blooming yellow rose, I experience my life as a continuous, golden unfolding. Despite the daily stresses that human life brings, abundance, gratitude, and joy are my daily diet\u2014synchronicity, intuition, and faith are my guiding lights. How did I get here, to this place of joy and wholeness? Believe me, it wasn't always this way\u2014there were many, many years of struggle and misery first. This is a story of how I got my Self back, using my first language: dance. My path to wholeness began, as is so often the case, with a breakdown. Everything in my life had to fall apart before I could come to recognize the dis-ease. It was the 90s. I was in New York City aspiring to become a professional choreographer\u2014at least that was the plan. By day I was a nanny on the Upper East Side, and in Soho. After hours was another story: I was a wild woman on the loose, wanting to experience everything now . I was looking to be discovered as the next best thing. I felt unstoppable! I barely needed sleep at night. My life was a perpetual adventure: dancing at clubs almost every night, meeting artists and rebels wherever I went, rocking such extreme style as if every day was Halloween, I felt so alive... and yet, I began to see a shadow side to the wild ride. Eventually I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. My delusional mania had ripped through my life like a raging tornado; the wreckage it left behind\u2014including lost jobs and ruined friendships\u2014was immense. I came home to heal. The mania flipped into a dreadful, dark depression, during which I recognized the \"crazy\" and the destruction of the mania. At this point I agreed to therapy and a medication (which I haven't needed now for twenty years). I am grateful to my parents for their crucial support. Sometimes when I see a homeless person with obvious signs of a mood or mental disorder I think, \"that could have been me\"\u2014if my parents hadn't pushed me toward psychiatric help, and had the resources to cover it, what would have become of me? I am one of the lucky ones. From this humble place, I slowly and steadily built myself back up, one day at a time. The light in my life became teaching creative dance to kids through Ann Arbor Rec & Ed. The next big leap toward wholeness was the birth of my son. When he was born, I knew it was go time. There was no way I was not going to be the absolute best mother possible to this beautiful, beloved boy. I was motivated to become my best \"me.\" I transitioned from working at Whole Foods Market to become a full-time dance teacher. My undergraduate studies of dance and creative writing had built a foundation of how to focus my passionate creativity into real works of art. To take my career to the next level, I now went to grad school to get a master's in counseling psychology. Feeling such therapeutic release and joy when I danced, I wanted to understand more about the inner workings of the human experience and of healing. Then I discovered Nia, a holistic fitness practice that became the doorway to a world of personal healing that has made everything thereafter possible. It demonstrated how dance could be restorative: creating wholeness and connection rather than judgment and separation. The Nia Technique, created in the early 80s, teaches us to move from the inside out. It teaches us to be free to move \"The Body's Way\" while using technique to stay safe and grounded. It taught me (in contrast to the culture of professional dance that I experienced in college) that I didn't have to be anorexic, get my leg up over my head, or look perfect to be a \"real dancer.\" Nia taught me how to listen, and to feel joy in the listening to the music, to my body, to life. Teaching Nia was a sink-or-swim affair: I had been certified for two weeks when my classes began\u2014initially at the YMCA and A2Yoga, then EMU and UM\u2014and I have never looked back since. That was 17 years ago! Now I teach a variety of dance and movement classes to a wide variety of populations. No matter if I'm teaching highly athletic folks or those with Parkinson's disease, I use the principles of Nia in everything I share. From Our Current Issue Read the rest of the story online!The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, June 24, 20226By Rob Meyer-Kukan self-care /self ker/ noun - the practice of taking action to preserve or improve one's own health. Since the beginning of the pandemic, self-care has been paramount. As we navigated the changing of safety protocols, health mandates, closures, changes, and we all learned to \"pivot\"... the preservation of one's self and what is needed to care for one's own health has quickly come front and center. As a bodyworker, offering massage and sound therapy, reiki, reflexology and more, I am deeply grateful for the opportunity to help others \"hear, see, and feel true wellness\" as our company tag line states. With rising costs of living and financial concerns looming, getting the most out of our investment is a priority. This also applies to the investment we make in our self-care. In my work, I am lucky enough to see my clients for an hour or ninety minutes each week, mostly. But what about the other 167 (or 166.5) hours in a week? I offer the following tools to help deepen the experience of their session throughout the week. Water Depending on which anatomist you ask, the body is made up of 60 % to as much as 80% of water. Also, in general, we don't drink enough water and we are generally dehydrated. So, after a session it is important to continue to hydrate. I encourage you to drink filtered water with a pinch of natural salt in it (Himalayan, Sea Salt, or Redmond Real Salt, not iodized salt). This not only hydrates the body; but also helps to remineralize as well as to deliver electrolytes without added sugars or dyes. NOTE - There is an ongoing debate if bodywork releases toxins into the body that need to be flushed out, or not. I prefer to focus on the importance of hydration for optimal function, rather than eliminating perceived toxins. Epsom Salt Bath/Soak Take a soak in an epsom salt bath. If baths aren't your thing or if you don't have access to a tub, soak your feet in a tub of water with epsom salts. Again, there are a lot of claims about what happens in and with an epsom salt bath; but in my experience the heat from the water, combined with the calming effects of magnesium sulfate brings relaxation to tight muscles, stress relief, and reduces inflammation. Arnica Homeopaths use Arnica (Arnica Montana) for treatment of muscle pain, stiffness, swelling from injuries, and bruises. Arnica can be used by taking it internally (those little pellets you can buy in the blue tubes at health food stores), or used topically in an oil, cream, or salve. Arnica can be an excellent supportive tool as you seek to get the most out of your self-care. Move Last but not least, after your bodywork, energy work, or sound therapy session, get up and move! Gentle movement is encouraged to keep your muscles and tissues happy, relaxed, elongated, and free of tightness. This may take the form of gentle stretching, yoga, Tai Chi or Qigong. Intense exercise isn't recommended the day of your session; but can be resumed as you feel motivated in the days following your appointment. Preserving and improving our own health is the goal with self-care. Whether you choose bodywork, massage, energy work, meditation, reflexology, or any of the other amazing self-care offerings available to us, these helpful tips can assist you in getting the most out of your self-care efforts between appointments or in the other 167 hours of the week.

Getting the Most Getting the Most out of Your out of Your Self-Care EffortsSelf-Care Efforts The Crazy Wisdom Weekly, June 24, 20227 Crazy Wisdom Book Picks of the Week On March 11, 2020, the day the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a global pandemic and all of our lives began to change in unprecedented ways, Todd Doughty knew he needed to do something to help him stay connected to the everyday joys of daily life. So he wrote down a list of things that make him happy: The musical intro to \"All Things Considered.\" Someone forgiving you. Someone believing in you. Your foot sticking out from under a blanket in order to find the cool spot. Freshly cut yellow tulips. A really good burger. Many, many lists later, Little Pieces of Hope pulls together the best of Doughty's lists along with never-before-seen entries, essays, musings, prompts, quotes, and playlists that offer solace, connection, and a daily touchstone of joy in a difficult world. A beautiful keepsafe full of goreous illustrations, Little Pieces of Hope is brimming with the pleasures of life, inspiring readers to look for and celebrate the good things that surround us.

Rankin Have you ever had a day where nothing was really going as planned? Or one you knew was going to be busy and full of stressors? We've probably all had a day where we felt ill, and energetically on empty with no desire to power through. Did you make yourself a nice cup of tea and instead of drinking it from a travel mug on the go, you sat and enjoyed your tea for a few moments? Did it make you feel better and more equipped to deal with the moment? My best guess is yes! If so, then you've experienced firsthand the ability a simple cup of tea has to transport, nourish, and fortify. You indulged in a simple time- tested act of healing and self-care. An activity that could easily be ritualized. Using tea to commune with the sacred has a long history starting in ancient China. It's the intention that makes it a ritual. As a student of herbal remedies, I've had the pleasure of spending time learning the medicinal properties of various plants. When studying the medicinal properties of plants, you also learn the history of usage and folklore associated with herbs along with the metaphysical or magical properties that various cultures assigned to the plants. In many cases plants are associated with Deities as well. It is fascinating to explore these underutilized properties and connections. Let's say you're working on being a more loving person to yourself and others, or perhaps you'd like to magnetize a romantic partner. If you're a fan of tea, wouldn't it be fun to learn all the various plants that are associated with or sacred to, Venus, the goddess of love and beauty? Imagine creating a blend of your favorite Venus herbs that you keep in a beautiful container, and you savor your special blend before an anticipated first date, or better yet, you drink it every morning to remind yourself to be open to love and serendipitous encounters. That is just one of many ways you can use plant associations with a deity to set an intention and improve your life in some way. Love, of course, is a universal theme, we'd all like to have more love and be more loving. Qualities like love, grace, mercy, collaboration, nurturing, and receptivity are commonly thought of when referencing the divine feminine, but it is important to note that this is a very narrow definition. Power, destruction, rage, transformation, strength, justice, truth, wildness, and wisdom are prominent aspects of the divine feminine as well. When most of the world moved to a monotheistic belief system, we stopped sharing much of the cultural knowledge around different ways of being feminine. It's time to recover the myths, legends, and stories of impactful Goddesses as part of our human heritage. I believe connecting intentionally with plants is a portal back to this 'lost' knowledge, and yet another way the divine feminine is bubbling up. Visit Fierymaple.com to learn more. Visit Fierymaple.com to learn more. When I observe the world it's clear to me that many people are looking for alternative ways to live, work, play, learn, and heal. Old systems of doing and being just aren't working for many of us any longer. In the United States we have created a hyper-masculine society. Our values of independence, freedom, and competitiveness are wonderful traits when they are balanced by interdependence and collaboration (qualities associated with the divine feminine), without such balance they have hardened into a hierarchical, overly patriarchal, aggressively independent- minded mentality of 'survival of the fittest.' An unbalanced society where values traditionally associated with the Divine Feminine are not honored and cultivated is a weakened society, and one where both women and men have difficulty connecting to and developing their Divine Feminine qualities. It harms both genders. Exploring qualities of various Deities and their cultures is a fun and engaging way to be a small part of the worldwide rise of the Divine Feminine. I'd posit it's a beneficial transformative experience wherever your faith lies. Hot water, dried plant matter, a favorite teacup, steam, inhale, exhale. Simple. Inexpensive. Effective.

I grew up singing in church as a little girl. The worship portion was always my favorite part of the service (and often the only part that I thoroughly paid attention to!). My family was also very musical and there was always singing and instruments involved in our family gatherings when I was young. I have fond memories of \"barn jam sessions\" at my grandparents house with my uncles. So, really, music has always been woven into the fabric of my life but it wasn't something I put a lot of thought into pursuing on a more professional level until after college. I met my former duo partner, John, at an open mic and he really encouraged me to take my musical skills more seriously and that duo, The Potter's Field, opened up an entirely different path than I had imagined for myself. I'm incredibly grateful it did! What are your favorite aspects of live performance? Interacting with the audience! The pandemic really reinforced to me how essential the relationship between performers and audience members is - it's just not the same without that collaboration! I love the energy of a live room and the energy of the crowd absolutely influences the energy of the musicians (and vice versa). It's this beautiful exchange of energy that you don't get to experience in other facets of life. After the last two years of minimal opportunities to perform, I'll never take that for granted! What have you been doing during the pandemic? What are you focused on now? I wish I could tell you that I was focused on songwriting or really taking my guitar skills to the next level ;) Honestly, the pandemic was hard on many levels - I simplified my life in a lot of ways and tried to focus on what was immediately in front of me. While I wasn't performing or writing much during that time, it did allow me to reconnect with music as a listener. I rediscovered artists and songs that I hadn't listened to in years and found that I had a deeper appreciation for what they had to say (John Prine in particular became a voice I revisited often during that period). Right now I'm focusing on trying to see what I want out of the next part of my journey as a musician. I know that playing music feeds me on a deep level and, while I'm reevaluating how I want to move forward, I'm very excited to see what comes next. I have several songs percolating right now and I'm excited to feel inspired to write again! What is your guiding philosophy of life and art (music)? Maya Angelou said \"The idea is to write it so that people hear it and it slides through the brain and goes straight to the heart.\" That quote resonates with me as an artist - it's a reminder to create from a place of honesty and to not shy away from the hard stuff. The art and music that I connect with most always comes from a place of vulnerability. I'm trying harder these days to use that as a guide for my relationships and interactions with people as well - just skip past the surface level and go straight to the heart.

How can I cope with the sleep deprivation, and prioritize my own rest and well-being?
