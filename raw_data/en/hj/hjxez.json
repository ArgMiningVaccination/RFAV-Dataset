Once the contents of the 'degrees' has been exposed to public ridicule, many universities have stopped doing it. All (or nearly all) of these pseudo-degrees have closed at the [University of Salford](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=885), the [University Central Lancashire](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2485), [Robert Gordon the of Buckingham](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2881), and even at the [University of Westminster](http://www.dcscience.net/?p=1329) (the worst offender), one course has closed (with rumours of more to follow). | | I've already written about the course in Traditional Chinese Medicine at the University of Salford ( One place that has yet to come under close scrutiny is | | Michael Driscoll, VC of Middlesex University. The buck stops with him. Their \"Complementary Health\" courses are as follows (April 2010). [Complementary Health Sciences (Ayurveda) Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/complementary_health_sciences_Ayurveda_bsc.aspx) [Herbal Degree, BSc Honours](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/complementary_health/traditional_chinese_medicine_bsc.aspx) and also two postgraduate courses I asked Middlesex University for samples of their teaching materials under the Freedom of Information Act, and, as usual, the request was refused. As usual, I then asked for the mandatory internal review of the decision, and this time, most unusually, the internal review did not confirm the initial refusal and I was sent a bundle of teaching materials about Chinese Herbal Medicine, It was not all I asked for, but it is quite enough to show the absurd ideas that are still being taught as part of bachelor of Science degree in a UK University. Not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people. The vice-chancellor of Middlesex University, [Professor Michael Driscoll](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx), is an economist, not a biologist. Surely you don't need to be a scientist to feel a bit suspicious when you read on the Middlesex web site about Traditional Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion including distribution of meridians-collaterals and location of acupoints; needling and moxibustion techniques; Have any of the members of [the Executive](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/Executive/index.aspx) ever thought to ask about what goes on in these courses? Even if it is beyond an economist to see through the nonsense, surely it should be possible for Professor Margaret House, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Academic, whose interests lie in water quality, should be able to, though as Dean of the School of Health and Social Sciences she appears to sponsor the nonsense. And Professor Waqar Ahmad, Deputy Vice-Chancellor Research and Enterprise, who has written a s book on Ethnicity, Health and Health Care, should surely be able to distinguish sense from nonsense in health care? In that respect, I'd have less confidence in Katie Bell, Chief Marketing Officer, who joined Middlesex University in 2009 following a career in brand marketing for Nestl\u00e9 UK and GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Marketing people seldom have much regard for truth. Have any of the [University's Governors](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/aboutus/whoiswho/governors/Biographies/index.aspx) ever asked what is going on in their name? It's true that none of the long list of distinguished-sounding governors is a scientist. Surely you don't need to be to question whether or not what follows can be described as 'science'. My guess is that none of these distinguished people has ever bothered to look at the dangerous nonsense that is being taught in their University. It is not in the nature of 'managers' to look far beyond ticked-boxes and profit, They should have done of course, but to make it easier for them, here is a small selection of the slides that I was sent (the copyright for them lies with the university: these few slides come under the heading ' 'fair quotation' and it is undoubtedly in the public interest to show them). Course CMH 1211 e Uhuh, my spleen qi is well and truly knotted already though when I learned physiology it was not thought that the spleen had much to do with emotions. Ah so at least the problem of heavy breathers is solved. But high temperature, abdominal pain and abnormal pulse can be signs of serious illness. If your only explanation for them is \"preponderant evil Qi\", you are a menace to public health. All these symptoms could be the result of a serious disease. It is not only antiquated nonsense to talk about them in terms of Yin, Yang and Qi. It endangers people, Course CMH 2212 Chinese materia medica. Some of the herbs are likely to contain active ingredients (indeed some are very dangerous). It would be quite possible to study the ingredients of these herbs and to investigate how they work in the light of what has been learned about physiology and pharmacology in the last 200 years. Pharmacology has a long history of doing that, But is seems to play no part in this course. Herbs are \"cold\" or \"hot\" and may \"check the exuberance of yang\". and so on, just preposterous, made-up nonsense from another era. If it were taught as cultural history, it might be interesting. But it is being taught as though it were true, and an appropriate way to treat sick people. Course CMH 3214 Would you trust your child to someone who'd been taught that \"causes of paediatric diseases are relatively simple\", and \"children are pure yang\"? Now some Chinese recipes Course CMH 3100 This may or may not taste good, but to recommend it for diabetes is seriously irresponsible. The programme specification for the \"BSc (Hons) Traditonal Chinese medicine\" can be [found here](http://www.mdx.ac.uk/Assets/BSc%20_Hons_%20Traditional%20Chinese%20Medicine%C2%A0%2018.pdf). [local copy [download](/mdx-tcm.pdf)] It is written with all the official trappings, just as though the degree was about science. It isn't. It is a danger to public health. I have asked the vice-chancellor, Michael Driscoll, to express his view of these comments Follow-up A rather unexpected comment from [a London acupuncturist](http://acupuncture.blog.co.uk/2010/04/12/dc-s-improbable-science-blog-dangerous-chinese-medicine-taught-at-university-8352795/). \"At least,I knew that Professor David Colquhoun is very skeptical about Chinese medicine. he comment Chinese medicine study\"not only are the ideas absurd, pre-scientific, indeed antiscientific. They are also dangerous. People who have been taught this nonsense are going out and being let loose on sick people.\" \" \"But,I still like to read his blog as His article very is respectable. I think. Look this...\" The skeptic blog featured this post in its [weekly roundup](http://skeptic.org.uk/news/2010/2545). 27 May 2010. [Times Higher Education reported](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780) the decision of Middlesex University to close its philosophy department. This department seems to have a [remarkable reputation](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411482), not least for a post-1992 university. Three academics and four students have been suspended and gagged in classical bullying style. This has happened while they continue to teach dangerous rubbish like that described above. I left [a comment at Times Higher](http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=411780), as follows. It is a reflection on the quality of university management that Middlesex has chosen to shut its philosophy department while continuing to run degrees in quackery. These courses not only offer an Hons BSc for memorising chunks of anti-scientific nonsense. They also pose a real danger to patients. See http://www.dcscience.net/?p=2923 I can think of no better illustration than this of the crass nature of the judgements made by Middlesex's management. They are either ignorant of what constitutes science, or they are corrupt. I see no other possibilities. In either case they should not be running a university. I think Prof Michael Driscoll owes the world an explanation. "}
