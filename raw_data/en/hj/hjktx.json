Seve rely debilitating: means diseases or conditions that cause major irreversible morbidity. Examples of severely debilitating conditions include blindness, loss of arm, leg, hand or foot, loss of hearing, paralysis or stroke. 'Short Form' is a written consent document stating that the required elements of informed consent have been presented orally to the subject or the subject's legally authorized representative (LAR). Significant risk device: an investigational device that: (1) is intended as an implant and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; (2) is purported or represented to be for a use in supporting or sustaining human life and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a s ubject; (3) is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject; or (4) o therwise presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject. Source Data : all information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial. Source data are contained in source documents (original records or certified copies) . Page 16 of 17 O ctober 2021 Source Document: is the initial documentation of data in a clinical study and includes recorded observ ations, laboratory reports, medical records, etc. Sponsor: is the individual or company that initiates but does not actually conduct the investigation . The sponsor can be any legal entity, including a company, an academic organization, or an individual. Sponsor -Investigator: means an individual who both initiates and conducts the clinical investigation and under whose immediate direction the investigational drug or device is being administered, used, or dispensed. The sponsor -investigator assumes all of the responsibilities of the sponsor as well as all the responsibilities of an investigator as outlined in the Form FDA 1572. Study Personnel: Principal investigators, co -investigators, sub -investigators, research coordinators, and any other research team members who have contact with research participants and/or participants' research data and identifiers. Individuals whose primary contact with the participant is in the context of clinical care, but offer no additional role in research, are not considered key research personnel. Sub-Investigator : an individual who is a member of the clinical trial team designated and supervised by the investigator to perform critical trial -related procedures and/or to make important trial -related decisions (for example, ass ociates, residents, research fellows). Subject: a human who participates in an investigation, either as an individual on whom or on whose specimen and investigational device or drug is used or as a control. A subject may be in normal health or may have a medical condition or disease. Suspension: An action taken by the PHCIRB, PHCIRB Chair, or Institutional Official (IO) or designee to temporarily withdraw approval for some or all research activities in the interest of protecting research participants. Suspended protocols are considered open but m ay not continue enrollment or research activities that are not essential to the protection of research participants. The PHCIRB will advise researchers of the timing of the continuing renewal request requirement. Systemic Investigation: An activity that i nvolves a prospective research plan which incorporates data collection, either quantitative or qualitative, and data analysis to answer a research question. Tabled: Postpone determination of approval. The IRB may require the investigator to make substantive changes to the protocol or informed consent documents, or submit clarifications or additional documents. The research may not proceed until the IRB reviews the revised research project and approves it at a subsequent convened meeting. Situation where the IRB cannot make the determination required for approval. The IRB may require the investigator to make substantive changes to the protocol or informed consent documents, or submit clarifications or additional. Page 17 of 17 O ctober 2021 Terminate/Terminations: The action taken by the PHCIRB to permanently withdraw approval for all research activities (excepting those activities required to protect research participants). Terminated protocols are considered closed and do not require a continuing renewal. Test article: any drug for human use, biological product for human use, medical device for human use, human food additive, color additive, electronic product, or any other article subject to regulation under the act (Food and Drug Act). Unanticipated Problem (involving risks to study subjects or others) : to include any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria: 1. Unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied; 2. Related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly r elated means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and 3. Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physica l, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized. Withdrawals (Participant): Participants who signed the consent form, but later withdrew from the project. This does not include screen failures. Withdrawals (Submissions): Items that are submitted via IRBNet that either were in error or did not qualify for prompt submission. Working Agreement : Piedmont specific document that outlines which Piedmont services a researcher may utilize within the Piedmont entity for a research project. "}
