New Offerings by Established Practitioners and Businesses The Natural Healing Center for Massage and Bodywork at Hogback and Clark Roads is under new leadership as of September 2010 , and is proud to announce the addition of new practitioners who offer expanded services that include mental, emotional, and spiritual health modalities. In addition to massage therapy and bodywork, clients can now reap the benefits of services that incorporate health and wellness education, nutritional counseling, and spiritual healing/clearing of blocks utilizing the energy work of Spiritual Response Therapy. The center is offering unique workshops this coming spring and summer, including a beginning workshop on \"How to Use a Pendulum,\" accessing spirit for receiving answers, and a \"Sacred Sound Healing\" class. The center has been known as a stress relieving clinic since 1995, specializing in therapeutic massage, foot reflexology, Reiki energy healing, hot stone massage, neuromuscular deep tissue technique, and myofascial release. Annie Kopko, massage therapist, has been with the center since 1997 and is an ordained Interfaith Minister offering spiritual counseling. Loraine Webster, reflexologist, has extensive experience with a wide variety of natural healing therapies and advises her clients on health, energy, and wellness. The center is in the process of building a team of practitioners who offer alternative and complementary healing services. Space is available for rent for those who are like-minded in heart and in mission. The Natural Healing Center is offering special packages for the spring and summer. Between May and August of 2012 clients can purchase any number of the following packages: #1 is a sampler pack and includes one session each of massage therapy, reflexology, and Spiritual Response Therapy (SRT), for $170, (value $220); #2 is a package of two sessions of SRT for $150, (value $180); and #3 is a package of three sessions of either massage therapy or reflexology for $100, (value $130). To contact the Natural Healing Center, email info@nhca2.com or call (734) 973-8290. The Center's website is www.nhca2.com. The Center is located at 2002 Hogback Rd #14, Ann Arbor, 48105.Clinical Psychologist Dr. Eve Avrin, Ph.D., has been in private practice since 1996 using traditional psychotherapy with elements of spirituality and the Law of Attraction. Recently, she has also begun to apply her attention and talents to two new endeavors. Avrin received training in Reiki, an ancient form of hands-on healing which focuses on \"universal life-force,\" in 1994. For years she used the skill on herself, family, and friends. Now she has made this service available to clients through her new Reiki practice. Avrin also recently began training in Shamanism through the Four Winds Society's Healing the Light Body School. Alberto Villoldo, the school's founder and author of Shaman Healer Sage, is, like Avrin, a clinical psychologist as well as a medical anthropologist. As part of the required practice for this training, Avrin occasionally offers Shamanic healing sessions free of charge. Dr. Avrin practices at the Parkway Center, 2345 S. Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. She can be reached by phone at (734) 546-9645. Congratulations to Cindy Klement! A long-established and respected nutritionist in this region, Klement has received her master of science degree in Human Nutrition from Eastern Michigan University. Klement has been in private practice since 1984. She has served over 3,500 clients since then, and opened her present office at the Parkway Center in Ann Arbor in 1997. Klement was inspired to study holistic medicine and herbalism after a life-changing encounter with a stranger when she was a young woman. Having grown up the daughter of parents who owned a convenience store, she says her idea of breakfast was \"Ho-Ho's and chocolate milk.\" Plagued by health problems that had her on prescription drugs and hospitalized more than once, she took the stranger's advice and overhauled her diet, also beginning to use a few herbs. Within six months her health problems had disappeared and she knew that she had found her vocation. \"Although I've been in practice for almost 30 years, I recognized that laws are changing toward licensing for nutritionists and I didn't want to be forced out of work on a technicality,\" Klement said, explaining why she went back to school at the age of 53. Now that she has graduated, she plans to sit for the board-certified clinical nutrition exam and pursue national certification as a health educator. Cindy Klement can be reached at (734) 975-2444 or at cindyklement@gmail. com. (For more on Cindy Klement, see her article on page 70, which is this issue's Sustainable Health column.) Dena Bowen, local Bowenwork practitioner, has begun offering Bowenwork4Kids, a free service for children ages newborn to 18. Bowenwork is a gentle soft-tissue manual therapy designed by Tom Bowen (no relation to Dena Bowen), which has been practiced for over 50 years and is taught in 26 countries. When Bowen started her practice in 2008, she would work on parents and treat their children for free in the spirit of Tom Bowen, who valued giving back to the community. She began to realize that children can display many of the same symptoms as adults, which usually go untreated. She explains, \"Before I was trained in Bowenwork, I thought that kids just had an automatic reset system, and given enough time, their symptoms would disappear. I now know that many symptoms go underground only to reappear many years later.\" What's New in the Community The Natural Healing Center is offering unique workshops this coming spring and summer, including a beginning workshop on \"How to Use a Pendulum,\" accessing spirit for receiving answers, and a \"Sacred Sound Healing\" class. Bowen was introduced to Bowenwork in 2007. Having unsuccessfully tried many therapies, including chiropractic, massage, heat and pain medication for a chronic hip problem, she was uninterested in trying yet another treatment modality. Finally, she says her girlfriend convinced her to give it a try, and she was converted after the first session, after which the pain in her hip never returned. \"After several sessions, I began to notice that Bowenwork not only helped on a physical level, but also on a personal level. As I began to release the pent up stress that had been locked in my body, I felt calmer and happier,\" she says. Amazed by the results, she decided to seek training in the therapy and became a certified Bowenwork Practitioner in 2008. The goal of Bowenwork is to rebalance and reset the body as a whole, releasing fascial restrictions in order to restore natural alignment. Bowen calls it \"the alternative to alternative therapies\" and says that benefits are immediate, with complete symptom resolution often occurring in only a few sessions. For babies and children, it can help with injuries, sprains, digestive disorders, ADD/ADHD, developmental delay, and even bedwetting. She says that Bowenwork can help children excel in sports, do better academically, and succeed socially. Bowen notes that since Bowenwork requires approximately two minutes between movements for the body to reset itself, more than one child can be worked on simultaneously. This makes events like Bowenwork4Kids possible. Jackie Kilburn, occupational therapist and owner of Jump-In Sensory and Processing Wellness Center in Hamburg, Michigan, recognized the value of Bowenwork4Kids as a great way to reach out to the community, and encouraged Dena and other practitioners to help as many children as possible. Jump-In provides leading edge therapy in sensory processing and neurological integration for children and adults, reflex integration techniques and several types of manual therapy and energy medicine. Bowenwork4Kids is offered at Jump-In on the second Saturday of each month from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. and is free of charge. Jump-In Sensory and Processing Wellness Center is located at 10400 Hamburg Rd., Hamburg, MI 48139. More information about Bowenwork4Kids is available at www.denabowen.com, and Dena Bowen can be reached by phone at (810) 824-1604 or emailed at Bowentouch1@yahoo.com.

See article on page 17 Kristin Pearce, M.S., counselor, life coach, and former Registered Nurse, has recently completed training as a Reconnective Healing Practitioner.

Accelerate recovery from accidents and Injuries? Reduce stress? & sports performance? Bowen and /f_ind out why Bowenwork is called the \"Alternative Therapy to Alternative Therapies!\"Kristin Pearce, M.S., counselor, life coach, and former Registered Nurse, has recently completed training as a Reconnective Healing Practitioner. Reconnective Healing is a form of energy healing discovered by Eric Pearl, author of The Reconnection: Heal Others, Heal Yourself. Pearl was a successful chiropractor for 12 years before a random encounter with a healer, after which his patients began sensing his hands over them without being touched and experiencing miraculous healing of ailments from fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome to epilepsy, cancer, and AIDS-related diseases. Pearl says Reconnective Healing \"brings in 'new' axiatonal lines (part of a timeless network of intelligence and the parallel dimensional circulatory system) that enable us to standardize unique vibratory levels and frequencies for healing and, ultimately, for our evolution.\" Sessions consist of the healer placing their hands near the person to be healed and attuning to these frequencies. Results are fast, requiring just one to three sessions for completion. Pearl has said that, while everyone experiences healing with these techniques, sometimes the healing is different than what was expected. He says, \"The healing may take place on an other than conscious level. Reconnective Healing brings you to a space that allows you to have a healing that is most appropriate to you on your life path.\" Pearce now offers Reconnective Healing as a complement to her life coaching practice. After receiving her master's degree in counseling studies in 2008, she began a counseling practice that evolved and expanded into life coaching. Pearce now offers weekly individual and group coaching sessions that focus on spiritual growth, physical health, abundance, realizing individual potential, and living your dreams. She says her practice \"offers individuals an opportunity to heal and improve all aspects of their lives.\" Kristin Pearce can be reached at kpearce310@aol.com or (734) 945-7076. Three new health care providers will be opening new practices at the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center, 1310 S. Main Street in Ann Arbor. Dr. Amy F. Saunders has established an integrative general medical practice to provide care for adults with both acute and chronic conditions. She has over 25 years of experience practicing General Internal Medicine and worked for the last two decades at University of Michigan. Saunders says that she is well-versed in alternative therapies and has an extensive network of expert practitioners to whom she refers patients for alternative therapies which complement their Western medical treatments. Jenna Wunder, M.P .H., R.D., is establishing a practice in whole foods nutritional counseling. She has spent the last ten plus years at the University of Michigan Integrative Medicine, where she practiced clinical dietetics at the IMWell Center and taught nutrition education throughout the university, including the medical school. Daniel Manwiller, who trained in Moody Theological Seminary's counseling psychology program, will be providing psychoneuroimmunology and counseling services for families with special-needs children. They will be joining Dr. Tony Boggess, D.O., who has been providing holistic family care through the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center for five years. All of the Natural Balance practitioners can be reached by calling (734) 929-2696 or visiting their website at nbwellness.com. Local musicians Lori Fithian (percussionist & drum circle leader), Jean Chorazyczewski, and Pauline Loewenhardt have collaborated with Canadian songwriter and activist Carolyn McDade and other women on a new CD entitled Widening Embrace. The CD is to be the culmination of a year-long project in which women have gathered in ten regions of North America to live and sing these beautiful songs by McDade. The project will be completed in autumn of 2012, and CDs are available for pre-order, which will help fund the recording process. All profit from CD sales will be donated to environmental causes. The songs are described as arising \"from the energies of Creation, Earth, Universe, pulling us deep into the learning fields of forest, water, sky, stars.\" More information and pre-ordering for the Widening Embrace CD are available at www.carolynmcdademusic.com/widening_embrace/embrace.html. Books by Area Authors Local author Lakhi N. Goenka, Ph.D., published The Physics of Reality: Ramblings of a Grieving Engineer in July of 2011. Reacting to the death of his teenaged son, Goenka explores the mysteries of the universe as a scientist. He examines the bridge between science and spirituality with questions like \"why are we here?\" and \"is there a Creator?\" from the perspective of a doctorate engineer looking for meaning in physics. This book is intended for scientists and laymen alike, and will be of interest to anyone wondering how spirituality and science can coexist. Goenka is the husband of Brenda Bentley, author of Riverwalks Ann Arbor: Walking Loops Along the Huron River. The Physics of Reality is available at Crazy Wisdom Bookstore. More information is available at the author's website, www. PhysicsofReality.com. Upcoming Events On Thursday, May 17 from 7:00 to 8:30 p.m., Angela Watrous will teach a workshop called Deepening Empathy: An Introduction to Compassionate Communication at the Crazy Wisdom Community Room, sponsored by the People's Food Co-op. Watrous has written five non-fiction books and many articles on the topics of relationships and communication, and for the past six years has been studying and practicing Nonviolent Communication (NVC) through the nonprofit organization BayNVC. NVC, also known as Compassionate Communication or Empathic Connection, is based on the work of Marshall B. Rosenberg, Ph.D., and involves \"connecting with the feelings and universal needs of everyone in a situation and making clear and actionable requests toward meeting those needs,\" Watrous explains. She says that she sees the central question as \"how can I make your life more wonderful?\" Watrous says that after trying several forms of therapy, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, without much improvement in her overwhelming negative feelings, NVC immediately felt like the right solution. Whereas everything else seemed to focus on changing her emotions, NVC held that \"feelings are indicators of underlying needs that are being met or not.\" By acknowledging these feelings, Watrous says she was able to communicate and meet her needs more effectively, giving her a sense of hope and joy. After moving to Ann Arbor to pursue an M.F.A. at the University of Michigan, Watrous found that the area did not have a local NVC organization. She decided to bring NVC to Ann Arbor to share her experience of healing by learning to empathize with one's own needs and those of others. She now provides individual and couples sessions using NVC, as well as community seminars.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 15 Continued on page 16 What's New in the Community Continued from page 13 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 14 Three new health care providers will be opening new practices at the Natural Balance Wellness Medical Center: Dr. Amy Saunders, integrative general medicine; Jenna Wunder, whole foods nutritional counseling; and Daniel Manwiller, psychoneuroimmunology and counseling services for families with special-needs children.

On June 30, Leslie Science & Nature Center (LSNC) will be hosting two performances from the Zany Umbrella Circus. This event is a fundraiser for LSNC with all proceeds benefiting their environmental education efforts. The performances will be at 11:00 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. The event will be held outdoors, rain or shine, and people are encouraged to arrive early or stay late and wander the Center's nature trails, visit the animals in the Critter House, view 14 live educational Birds of Prey, and enjoy other activities. In the event of dangerous weather conditions, a rain date of Sunday, July 1 has been reserved. Zany Umbrella Circus, www.zanyumbrellacircus.com, is a Pittsburgh-based European- style folk art circus that uses physical theater, dance, and live music to tell stories. Under the direction of founder and executive director Ben Sota, the circus explores a fantastical realm where everyday items and experiences come to life and take on a magic of their own. For the LSNC, they will perform Stories of the Season , a show that celebrates the seasons and the natural world. This show is comprised of four short circus stories that celebrate the change of the seasons, human growth, and the different way stories can be told throughout the world. The show includes performances on the aerial fabric, trapeze, masks, and puppetry. They have performed across the country, including at the White House, and internationally in places such as Afghanistan, Jordan, and Ethiopia. Performers travel in a whimsically painted converted school bus. Food vendors will be present with all proceeds going to the LSNC. MetroParent Magazine , LSNC's largest sponsor, will provide additional child activities. The Leslie Science & Nature Center provides year-round family programming, field trips, a summer day camp, traveling educational birds of prey presentations, and birthday parties.

Reverend Selena Lucas is offering a new set of \"Parenting from the Heart\" workshops at the Center of Light Ann Arbor.Congratulations to Cindy Klement! A long-established and respected nutritionist in this region, Klement has received her master of science degree in Human Nutrition from Eastern Michigan University. See article on page 12 Correction In the last issue, in a What's New feature on the work of Dr. Joanne Karpinen, we mistakenly referred to the Integrated Network of Esoteric Healing. In fact, it is the International Network of Esoteric Healing (INEH), and Dr. Karpinen, who is a licensed psychologist and certified energy psychologist, will be leading workshops this year offered by INEH. For more information, go to www.integratedhealingjourneys.com.Continued on page 18 New Classes After 20 years of practicing Shiatsu, well-known local practitioner Frances Farmer has turned her attention to teaching and opened Ohashiatsu Ann Arbor, which offers intensive ongoing Shiatsu training. Ohashiatsu is a method of healing touch, meditation, and self-improvement. The Ohashi Institute, based in New York City, has standardized training in the Ohashiatsu style so that students can follow the same program in many locations worldwide. Currently, Ohashiatsu Ann Arbor is the only Ohashiatsu school in the Midwest. The basic curriculum courses are 30 hours each and may be taken independently or as part of a complete study. Learning is experiential and classes include lecture, exercises, meditation, and hands-on training. Farmer explains that body workers can benefit from Shiatsu because the practice is focused on the giver as well as the receiver. While turnover for body workers tends to be around seven years due to the physical exhaustion involved, Shiatsu is easier on the body of the practitioner and can comfortably be practiced for much longer, as evidenced by Farmer herself. Ohashiatsu Ann Arbor is located at 202 E. Washington Street, Suite 601, Ann Arbor, MI 48104. More information is available online at www.shiatsuannarbor.com or by calling (734) 417-9038 or emailing ohashiatsuannarbor@gmail.com.

New Practitioners & Businesses Dr. Mark Chappell-Lakin opened Live Well Chiropractic Center in February of 2011, shortly after earning his doctor of chiropractic from Life University in Marietta, Georgia, and completing an internship in 2010. Chiropractic is a second career for Chappell-Lakin, who also holds a degree in Elementary Education and previously ran outdoor adventure camps for children. He says he realized one summer when he was working at two different camps, including one he had helped found, that he had spent so much energy on others' children that he didn't have enough left for his own. It was time for a change, and he was inspired to look into chiropractic by his friends, Doctors Robert and Sherri Borer who own a chiropractic practice in Saline. Beyond the normal chiropractic coursework, Chappell-Lakin has completed extensive coursework in pediatric and sports chiropractic as well as chiropractic for pregnant women. He says chiropractic tends to be \"pigeonholed as a treatment for neck and back pain in adults,\" with only about five to ten percent of chiropractors regularly seeing children. He uses his skills on all three of his own kids and believes that regular adjustments for children can minimize problems that build up over time, causing pain and problems later in life due to scar tissue, nerve damage, and muscular imbalances which develop in response to spinal misalignment. He says that children fall three to five thousand times in the normal course of childhood, not doing the kind of damage that would result in an emergency room trip, but causing small sprains and misalignments of the vertebral joints. He says that even birth can cause spinal damage, with studies showing that eight in ten hospital births result in some form of spinal injury. Chappell-Lakin's own son was adjusted only twelve hours after birth! By treating those small injuries as they arise, Chappell-Lakin believes that young patients can lead healthier, pain-free lives as they become adults. Thus far, his youngest patient has been just one month old; his oldest is 78. Nearing the second year of his practice, he plans to focus on treating more families. In addition to improving the health of the Ann Arbor community with quality chiropractic care, Chappell-Lakin is involved in a charity called Love Has No Color which aims to improve the health and well-being of Native Americans on the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana. His office and several others have \"adopted\" the reservation, where conditions are \"third-world in many respects.\" Love Has No Color is working to help the community break the cycles of poverty, violence, alcoholism, and suicide. He says he believes in the charity's vision that \"healthier people make a healthier planet!\" Live Well Chiropractic Center is located at 204 E. Washington St. in Ann Arbor.

Barry Lipscomb, newly married and new to Ann Arbor, has launched a conscious business consulting and leadership mentoring practice. Lipscomb draws on over 25 years of business experience, as well as many years of study in Eastern spiritual traditions, higher consciousness, and Shamanism. He calls this practice the culmination of a lifelong journey. Describing himself as an \"inquisitive child,\" he found himself exploring New Age concepts during and after college in the mid to late 1980s. He was on a corporate career path and, unfulfilled, turned to substance abuse. He says he would go to retreats at an ashram and then return to work, unable to hold on to the peace he had found, and rely on drugs to help him get by. In 2008, Lipscomb entered rehab and experienced what he calls a \"personal transformation,\" in which he was finally able to begin to connect experientially to his years of conscious study. He reflected on his years of business leadership and how the organizations he worked for attempted to \"create culture\" in ways that usually turned out to be ineffective because workers didn't understand how to use the tools they were given. While they benefited from the break in their day that the training provided, nothing really changed. Lipscomb began to think that if businesses have a collective consciousness, then, like individuals, they should be able to transform positively with a focus on that consciousness. He began to think about how he might bring genuine change to organizations and created the Conscious Business Model. This business model is the basis of his practice. He calls himself a \"Business Focalizer\" and says he \"draw[s] from this personal experience of transformation to better understand and connect with the consciousness of an organization. Combined with my business experience, this deepened understanding of consciousness has the potential to affect real change in a business organization.\" Lipscomb is looking to work with entrepreneurs, start-ups, and established businesses that want to add a conscious aspect to their operations. He invites anyone interested in this process to contact him for a complimentary exploratory consultation. More information about Lipscomb's practice is available online at www. barrylipscomb.com. He can be reached by email at barry@barrylipscomb.com or by phone at (917) 587-3775.

Erin of Zany Umbrella Circus at Leslie Science Center Digital thermography came to use in the 1980s by the military. It was used as a heat seeking tool with uses in night-vision, nighttime recovery of wounded soldiers, and bomb detection. The technology transfers well to the medical field where unusual body heat patterns are a sign of a problem or potential issue. Hayes-Thompson said that today's protocols for DITI are far more advanced and researched than in the past, giving more credibility to the procedure. \"We have strict protocols regarding temperature, light, camera distance from the patient,\" she said. So far, insurance companies do not cover the procedure, though policies with flexible spending accounts for preventive care can be used to cover the cost. Hayes-Thompson hopes that will change in the near future as more people become aware of this safer, green, natural alternative. The staff at Green Health Thermography includes a Registered Nurse and Registered Radiologic Technologist and Mammographer, and images are sent to MDs board certified in clinical thermology for interpretation. Green Health Thermography is located at 2345 Huron Parkway, Ann Arbor, MI.

Local Coach Deborah Campbell opened a new coaching practice in 2012, specializing in career transitions and personal transformation. She says, \"My clients tell me I help them get clear on what is meaningful and authentic to them. We then create strategies to accomplish what they desire and craft lives in line with their values. I provide support and motivation; they supply the accomplishments!\" Campbell is a professional artist and educator, currently an adjunct lecturer in the Art Department at Adrian College. She has been mentoring artists for over ten years, and says that her interest in life coaching was sparked when one of her students who had also experienced coaching pointed out that she was already doing it. \"The strategies are universal,\" she explains, whether working on creative goals or life goals. Inspired by this realization, Campbell began researching training programs for coaching, eventually settling on Coach U. She says Coach U's programs were quite intensive, which she appreciated because she wanted to get all the knowledge and training she could to feel confident as a coach. Campbell says that those who enlist the help of a professional coach will identify specific goals and reach them faster. They will receive tools, perspective, and accountability on their journey toward these goals. They will also reframe beliefs, clarify values, and align their lives with those values in order to create more meaning in their lives. She invites those who feel stuck, those who lack focus, or who need a sounding board to contact her. Campbell offers a complimentary first coaching session to allow clients to try the service with no obligation. She can be reached at (734) 645-6847 or deborahcampbellcoach@gmail.com.

The firm deadline for submissions for the next issue (September thru December 2012) is July 1, 2012.Green Health Thermography opened in January 2012 and offers Digital Infrared Thermal Imaging (DITI) services in Ann Arbor and the surrounding area. The business is owned and run by Drs. Mazharullah and Mastanbee Shaik, a husband and wife team originally from India. Per the Center for Disease Control (CDC), about one in eight U.S. women (just under 12 percent) will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Worldwide, more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. Dr. Mazharullah Shaik said, \"The CDC statistics are scary and the question needs to be asked, should we continue to concentrate on procedures that can only detect an existing lump, or should we be focusing on screening methods that can warn of a pending problem far in advance of a lump developing?\" He explained that for a tumor to grow to the size a mammogram can detect, a single cancer cell must divide into about four billion cells, a process which takes eight to ten years. \"When a cancer cell forms, it needs oxygen and nutrients. It is an area of higher metabolism,\" the clinic's office manager and clinical imaging technician Ann Hayes-Thompson said. \"Tiny vessels start to form around the cells to provide more oxygen in a process called angiogenesis.\" DITI technology can detect a mass as small as a tiny lemon seed while a mammogram will not detect a tumor smaller than a navy bean. The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) defines thermal imaging as a screening test for breast cancer and is designed to establish a baseline for ongoing comparative analysis to detect any physiological change that justifies additional testing. Such testing could be physician exam, mammogram, ultrasound, MRI, blood work, hormone testing or a number of other methods. In contrast to mammography, it is a radiation-free, pain-free, no-contact procedure that is safe for women of all ages, including those younger than fifty, under which current recommendations state that mammograms should not be routinely given. There are no contra-indications for thermal imaging, making it safe for pregnant women and those with breast implants. Dr. Shaik explained that in Eastern medicine, \"do no harm\" is a fundamental requirement, which thermal imaging clearly fulfills. At Green Health Thermography, screenings are performed by a female doctor certified in clinical thermography, making it a more comfortable test for women who value modesty for personal or religious reasons. The technology isn't limited to scanning for breast cancer. Thyroid, sinus, TMJ, dental, cardiovascular, digestion, and other diseases can be recognized in the patterns of heat given off by the body. The image is recorded and looks much like a weather report with varying colors representing weather conditions.

By Mary Runser Photos by John Fredericks This is the fourth in our series of articles on local business owners and their relatively newer businesses in Ann Arbor. From major corporations to small companies, business owners all over the state have been downsizing, reorganizing, and closing their doors in the last several years. And yet, as the economy in Michigan has steadily declined, there are still brave souls who have taken the leap of faith to open their own businesses here. Now that the economic recovery has begun, we hope these new businesses will be successful. In the profiles that follow, we travel vicariously to a couple of different places while staying right here in Ann Arbor. Ananth Pullela, owner of Jazzy Veggie and originally from India, brings some flavors of his homeland to Ann Arbor while also adding some American favorites, to give some flare and pizzazz to vegan and vegetarian meals. From there we move a couple of blocks down Main Street to The Himalayan Bazaar, a retail shop that specializes in importing items handmade by villagers in Nepal, owned by Heather O'Neal and Pem Dorjee Sherpa. Ananth and Sailaja Pullela, owners Jazzy Main St., Ann Arbor, 48104; 734-222-0203; www.jazzyveggie.com Jazzy Veggie, one of Ann Arbor's newer restaurants, opened its doors a year ago in the former Quizno's space on Main Street, two doors down from Crazy Wisdom Bookstore and Tearoom. The first thing you'll notice when you walk through the door is a wonderful aroma of spices that envelops you. And then you'll hear a \"hello\" ring out from a man with a wide smile to welcome you. That man is restaurateur Ananth Pullela (Andy), and he was gracious enough to spend some time talking with me about how he made his dream come true with Jazzy Veggie. The inspiration for Jazzy Veggie came from experiences Andy and his wife had while dining out. \"As vegetarians, it got tiring to always be at the mercy of the one or two vegetarian entrees on the menu, and they weren't anything to get really excited about,\" Andy said. \"We'd watch these meat entrees go out to tables and they had such wonderful, scintillating aromas; the barbeques, the chipotles, the fajitas. It just got me to thinking, why can't we have those aromas and flavors in vegetarian dishes? We have taste buds too!\" Born in India, Andy was accustomed to a vegetarian lifestyle. \"Indian cuisine is actually perfect for a vegetarian diet,\" He said. \"We have so many vegetables, only half of which you see here in the United States. Indian cuisine is similar to Mediterranean or Italian, in which you can do more creative things with flavor and aroma than in other types of cuisine.\" When you look at Jazzy Veggie's menu, you see flavors like barbeque and chipotle. \"They're all very flavorful. Vegetarian cuisine is more than just throwing together some grilled or roasted veggies in a bowl. I want to offer plant-based food that will [titillate] the taste buds.\" As a vegetarian operating a vegetarian restaurant, Andy pays attention to the details that keep the dishes pure. He explained that he used to go to restaurants and order minestrone soup, thinking that, since there was no meat in it, he was eating something vegetarian. \"I didn't realize that most minestrones are made with beef stock, so then it's not really vegetarian.\" At Jazzy Veggie, the food is not only vegetarian, it's also vegan \u2014 meaning there are no meat or dairy products of any kind used in the preparation. Preparing foods in a vegan style simplifies things operationally. \"It's too easy to mix things up, when you're working with both dairy and non-dairy products, and cause cross-contamination.\" At other restaurants, when one orders a vegetarian dish, it may be prepared in the same pan in which a steak was cooked \u2014 unless you specifically ask that a clean pan be used. \"Vegetarians can eat vegan, but not the other way around, when dairy is present. We have guests who are lactose intolerant, so it can be a major problem if they have serious allergies to dairy products. So, it's just easier to not use anything dairy. And the best part is that you won't even realize it.\" All of the sauces, marinades, aiolis, gnocchis, and pizza breads are made in-house, rather than sourcing from outside. \"It enables us to be more creative and try different things, while maintaining the quality,\" Andy stated. Andy came to the United States in 1993, completed his master's degree in industrial engineering, and began working as an engineer. In 2005, he began pursuing an MBA at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. Going through some of the rigors of the Business School program helped him to formalize some of his ideas, organize his thoughts, and follow the discipline to do a start-up. He began writing his business plan down on paper and devising ways to come up with the finances to turn his idea into a reality. \"I put a lot of our own personal finances at risk for this venture, as well as those from our family and friends, who are silent investors,\" said Andy. It's been scary to do that in this economy, but Andy still believes it was the right time to take this leap of faith. \"No one else is offering such food in the area. I see new customers walk through the door every day, and most of them have heard about us from someone else they know who has eaten here. Word of mouth is what we primarily rely on.\" Sailaja, Andy's wife, helps out with the restaurant too. Formerly, she was a lab manager on the research side in Internal Medicine at the University of Michigan. \"She runs the restaurant during the day until I come in the evening, then she picks up the kids (two daughters, ages 8 and 3) to go home and begin the parenting job.\" Sailaja is also a professional dancer and performs a classical Indian dance form called Kushipudi. She runs her own dance school, Natya Tarangini Kuchipudi Academy, in Canton. Andy has plans for the future of Jazzy Veggie. \"I would really like to build a brand around this. It represents a fast, casual eatery which serves plant-based comfort foods that appeal to veggie foodies.\" His customers often ask when he's going to open a location in another area. Andy does have some ideas about expanding and branching out, but he wants to get the Ann Arbor location rolling smoothly first. \"It's encouraging when a customer asks if I'm going to open another location. People like our food and it makes my day when I hear someone say so.\" Don't get the wrong idea; Andy isn't on a campaign to turn everyone into a vegetarian. In fact, while 50 percent of his customer base is vegetarian, the other 50 percent eats meat. \"Many people, whether for health or other reasons, are choosing to eat less meat in their diet. They may not be going completely meatless, but perhaps want to do a meatless Monday or Tuesday. Jazzy Veggie is a great alternative for a healthier lifestyle choice.\" Even in the current economy people will continue to dine out, but they may be choosier about where they'll spend their time and money. If you're looking for a fast, casual dining experience filled with aromas and flavors that will dazzle your taste buds, you might just be looking for the alternative experience that Jazzy Veggie can provide. ###\"I see new customers walk through the door every day, and most of them have heard about us from someone else they know who has eaten here.

Main Street, Ann Arbor, MI 48104; 734-997-7229; www.thehimalayanbazaar.com Next to Elmo's T-shirts between Washington and Liberty on Main Street in downtown Ann Arbor is a new specialty store called The Himalayan Bazaar, a joint adventure between Heather O'Neal and Pem Dorjee Sherpa. And yes, \"adventure\" is the proper term \u2014 because it encapsulates their business venture, as well as the adventure their lives have been (and continue to be). Heather spent her junior year of college in Kathmandu, Nepal, through the University of Wisconsin in 1986. \"I was only 20 years old and that year changed my life. I left my heart there, because I had to come home. My parents said I must graduate, although I was ready to stay.\" She vowed to get back to Nepal and did, twelve long years after going to work for the Peace Corps in Hungary and then teaching in Texas and Spain. Finally, in 1998, after telling a friend about her experiences in Nepal, they both decided to quit their jobs and go. \"Our plan was to trek [hike] up to Everest Base Camp, which is at an elevation of 17,600 feet. We were young and were going to carry all of our own things and just have a good time.\" A man from Scotland changed their minds by telling them it was safer and more enjoyable to have a porter go along. Convinced by what he'd said, they asked the lodge owner if he knew of such a porter, and Pem Dorjee Sherpa appeared shortly after. They had a wonderful time and \"Pem was great, always seeming to know what we needed or helping when the terrain got rocky or steep.\" A cultural note: The name \"Sherpa\" refers to the Everest Region ethnic group, of which Pem is a member. Because the Everest Base Camp Region sits at an elevation of 17,600 feet, people who live there are born with an incredible lung capacity and tend to be excellent climbers. So \"sherpa\" has also come to mean a climbing guide.After the trek, Heather began to think about how she'd just quit her job and really had no idea what she wanted to do with her life. \"What I did know was that this country and its people had become my passion, and if I could devise a way to share it with other Americans, that was what I'd do.\" She came up with the idea of bringing people to Nepal to trek the Base Camp of Mt. Everest and go on expeditions, and talked to Pem about it. Pem gave her an email address and promised her if she contacted him and told him she was on her way, he would meet her at the airport to help with her treks and expeditions. Heather came back to Ann Arbor and began giving talks in various locations around town. In 2000, she organized her company, Of Global Interest LLC Adventure Travel, and took her first customer to Nepal. She emailed Pem with the plans and, when they arrived at the airport, he was there to meet them. They had a great time trekking the Everest Base Camp route. That year, also as part of her business, Heather created a one-room bed and breakfast in her home called The Eighth Street Trekkers Lodge and started The Himalayan Bazaar in her garage, where she sold imports from Nepal that she'd brought home from her numerous trips. Meanwhile, Pem was keeping himself busy in Nepal. \"In 2004, I climbed all the way to the top of Mt. Everest [for the first time],\" he said. Pem was the porter or sherpa for an amputee, the first amputee to ever reach Everest's summit. Pem's duty, in addition to pointing out the best routes and keeping on track, was to carry the two different prostheses the man had specifically manufactured for this months-long climb. Once a sherpa has reached the summit of Everest, they gain a certain amount of notoriety and recognition. Heather was in Ann Arbor at the time and read about Pem's achievement online. He sent her a photo of himself holding a t-shirt with the company logo \"Of Global Interest LLC\" on the summit of Mt. Everest. In 2005, Pem again had the opportunity to climb Everest. The Rotary Club was celebrating its 100-year anniversary and the Rotary Club of Kathmandu decided that taking the Rotary flag to the summit of Everest would be a good way to celebrate. \"When Pem takes a group to Nepal to trek and climb, he comes back with items for the store. It cuts out the middleman and allows us to pay a fair price for our products. If we run out and aren't going to be traveling to Nepal for some time, Pem and Moni's family will ship to us.\" The Himalayan Bazaar is another way, besides tours, that Heather O'Neal has been able to share her love for Nepal with Americans.Heather and Pem also started a charity called the Global Interest Random Acts of Kindness Fund. They collect donations in the store, from people who participate in their treks and climbs, and via their website. \"With this fund, we sponsor projects in Nepali villages or at orphanages, clinics, or aid organizations in Kathmandu.Proprietors of Himalayan Bazaar, Heather O'Neal, left, and Pem Dorjee Sherpa, right. Pem and his wife, Moni, climbed Mt. Everest together and shared their wedding vows at 29,035 feet, becoming the first couple to marry on Everest's summit. \"Pem and Moni have become quite famous in Nepal,\" says O'Neal.Pem, a friend of his who was to film the climb, and Moni, a climber and member of the Rotary in Kathmandu, set out on the two-month adventure to climb Everest. Heather had seen Pem just before he was to climb Everest again, because she had taken another group to hike to the Everest Base Camp. \"I'd never seen him so nervous,\" she said. \"But I thought since he was getting ready to climb the mountain again, maybe he was right to be nervous.\" After returning to Ann Arbor, Heather was listening to a BBC story about a couple that had gotten married on Mt. Everest. Without hearing the whole story, she simply thought, \"Well, that's interesting.\" Later that day, she received an email from Pem, stating, \"We're successful. We're married!\" Heather was astonished, because when she'd seen him before the climb two months earlier, he'd never mentioned anything about getting married. (That explained his nervousness!) Pem and Moni had their reasons for not mentioning their plans to get married, primarily because Pem is Buddhist and Moni is Hindu. At that time in Nepal, crossing caste and religious boundaries was certainly looked down upon. Moni was afraid that, should they tell anyone of their plans to marry, her family would disown her. However, they had fallen in love and promised each other if they ever made it to the summit of Everest at the same time, they would get married there. They were successful with the climb, planted the Rotary International flag, and shared their wedding vows at 29,035 feet, becoming the first couple to marry on Everest's summit. Pem and Moni helped foster change in their country, especially for the generation of youth coming up behind them. \"Now it's more accepted that young people can marry someone they've fallen in love with, rather than marrying someone chosen for them, as in the traditional arranged marriage,\" Heather explained. \"And Moni has become an inspiration to young women, because city girls don't go [mountain] climbing, and yet she reached the summit of Everest and then married the man she loved. She's shown young women that they really can go for their dreams. Pem and Moni have become quite famous in Nepal.\" Pem sees many changes that have taken place in his country over the last few years. One of the biggest has been that there is no longer a king and the country is working toward creating a constitution. \"Once this takes place, I think the changes will be even more dramatic and will help place Nepal in a position to begin to compete with the rest of the world,\" he said. In 2008, after spending three years travelling back and forth between Nepal and Colorado to work with climbers, Pem and Moni moved to the United States. While living in Colorado, Pem took many groups back to Nepal to trek and climb in the Everest region. In 2011, Pem and Moni moved to Ann Arbor and joined forces with Heather again, to bring The Himalayan Bazaar from her garage to its current location. The Himalayan Bazaar still specializes in imports from Nepal. Nearly everything they sell in the store, from coats, apparel, and jewelry to scarves, singing bowls, and statuary, are made by Nepalese people. \"We do Fair Trade with the Nepalese people,\" Heather said. \"When Pem takes a group to Nepal to trek and climb, he comes back with items for the store. It cuts out the middleman and allows us to The Himalayan Bazaarpay a fair price for our products. If we run out and aren't going to be traveling to Nepal for some time, Pem and Moni's family will ship to us.\" The Himalayan Bazaar is another way, besides tours, that Heather has been able to share her love for Nepal with Americans. Business has been decent since opening in their current location. Heather said they had a nice summer, the Christmas season was fairly busy, and they're able to pay their bills. \"Pem has worked in similar stores in Colorado and has always wanted to own a store of his own,\" Heather said. \"So \u2014 so far, so good. It's been better than I expected, but then I didn't really know what to expect, either. This is more of a passion for me.\" Heather and Pem continue to conduct tours to Nepal, running the two businesses in tandem. \"Pem has done many more tours than I have over the past ten years. After Kenneth [her infant son, born last year] gets a bit older, I do intend to get back to doing tours as well.\" Heather and Pem also started a charity called the Global Interest Random Acts of Kindness Fund. They collect donations in the store, from people who participate in their treks and climbs, and via their website. \"With this fund, we sponsor projects in Nepali villages or at orphanages, clinics, or aid organizations in Kathmandu. Our trekkers on the trips can offer suggestions on what to do with the money during their trip. In the past, we've visited a cancer clinic, Mother Teresa's clinic in Kathmandu, a spinal injury rehabilitation center, and hospitals; we've given village children school supplies, toothbrushes, and jackets; we donated to a school for the blind, visited an organization that helps the animals, and much more. The fund is mostly by word of mouth and is intentionally small; a little goes a long way in Nepal.\" Heather and Pem also offer cultural talks to student groups. \"At the beginning of the school year, we had a few school groups come to the store to meet Pem and hear about his Everest climbs. The kids love it, and I think it broadens their horizons \u2014 to imagine far-away places and meet inspiring people like Pem. We talk about culture and geography and how the two may affect each other. We also take our talks on the road to community groups like the Rotary, Kiwanis, libraries, churches, senior citizen homes, schools, et cetera.\" Heather also plans to begin having her \"Gourmet Dinner Treks\" again this summer. \"These consist of having a traveling potluck dinner party at picnic tables in various parks throughout Ann Arbor, mostly along the Huron River. The routes are usually around five to eight miles long, and we stop three times: for appetizers, dinner, and dessert.\" Of course, these treks will be conducted with a real Sherpa. For a list of their upcoming local events, please visit www .thehimalayanbazaar.com/#!__ up-coming-event . For information on their tours to Nepal and Tibet, see www. ofglobalinterest.com/#!__up-coming-trips . If you intend to spend an afternoon shopping downtown and want to pick up something different, stop in and poke around at the Himalayan Bazaar. You'll be supporting a local business, contributing to the improvement of the lives of villagers in Nepal, and you'll get to meet some truly fascinating people. While there, be sure to pick up a copy of Heather's journal about her year spent in Kathmandu, Writes of Passage Through Nepal, which is a thoroughly enjoyable and enlightening read. When you leave The Himalayan Bazaar, you'll have a sense that you learned something new, and you'll have had some insights into your own place in the world around you. ### The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 23 Photographers Wanted To take pictures for The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 24 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 25 By Michelle Pafford Helms Photography by Gregory Fox \"Compassion is not so much what you do, as much as who you are and who you allow yourself to be.\" \u2014 Jane Dutton Most would agree that compassion \u2014 sympathetic consciousness of others' distress, together with a desire to alleviate it \u2014 is inherently good and needs no justification. Compassion crosses many societal, cultural, and religious traditions, and has been a common thread connecting humanity throughout the ages. Why, then, has this timeless virtue not fully made its way into our 21 st century workplaces? In corporate cultures, why do the words Aristotle espoused, that \"Compassion is good in and of itself,\" seem inaudible next to the Darwinian-inspired idea that \"Only the strong survive\"? Last fall, when the Occupy Wall Street protest movement grabbed the attention of many of us, pieces of it made their way into my psyche and positioned themselves next to information I was already processing \u2014 from the stream of media stories on the decline of business ethics in parts of corporate America. Increasingly, I began to wonder: Was there a counter-balance to all of the negativity surrounding the business world? It was then that I remembered the work of Jane Dutton, Ph.D., Robert L. Kahn Distinguished University Professor for Business Administration and Psychology at the University of Michigan, who studies compassion in organizations as part of the Stephen M. Ross School of Business's Center for Positive Organizational Scholarship (POS). In my mind, there couldn't be a better time than now for Dutton's research on compassion as a healing force for corporate culture. I had the opportunity to interview Dutton at the beginning of the new year of 2012. To prepare, I spent time over the preceding holiday break reading one of her books and studying her online compassion lab to learn about her rather rare field of study. Then, after e-mailing Dutton the questions ahead of time, I was put at ease with her modest response: \"While I don't have answers to all of your questions, I'll enjoy puzzling about them with you.\" During our interview, Dutton's welcoming manner was apparent as she explained her extensive body of work on compassion, which she calls \"the seed that connected me into the garden of Positive Organizational Scholarship.\" The following explains how that seed has taken root in Ann Arbor and is creating possibilities for re-imagining work organizations all over the world.A Strong Message from the Universe Dutton and her husband, Lance Sandelands, Ph.D. \u2014 who is also on the faculty at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business \u2014 first arrived in Michigan in 1989. They came from academic positions in New York: he from Columbia, she from New York University. A central moment in Dutton's career came into focus at U of M, when she became interested in studying compassion as the result of research she was involved with in the late 1990s, on people employed as hospital cleaners. \"I was interested in how people cope with being in devalued work. And one of the big surprises, which was really life-changing [for me], was how incredibly caring the hospital cleaners were for patients \u2014 and how they were contributing to the compassionate care of the hospital,\" Dutton said. The study confronted her and her colleagues with the question: \"How do we bring about a discussion of everyday caring, not just in hospitals, but with lots of different kinds of jobs?\" From that point on, Dutton decided one way to answer the question was to begin by studying compassion. Her decision was later affirmed by a colleague, Peter Frost, Ph.D., who shared an interest in researching the topic with her. The Center for POS was officially founded in 2001, when it was developed by a group of Ph.D.-educated scholars teaching at the U-M Business School alongside Dutton, including: Kim Cameron, Bob Quinn, Gretchen Spreitzer, Wayne Baker, and Lynn Wooten. Dutton was made the associate academic director for the center, which now has ten faculty members. Until the POS Center's establishment, Dutton was exploring an unconventional path. \"Before Positive Organizational Scholarship, my colleagues were jokingly calling me the 'Hallmark Card Lady.' It was seen as so weird to be studying compassion,\" Dutton said. However, in the summer of 2001, a small group of faculty from the psychology and business schools met to see if they could explore ideas from the positive perspective that were emerging simultaneously in the fields of psychology, political science, social work, and education. Based on that meeting, the group invited 30 academic leaders from around the country to come to Ann Arbor that upcoming November to continue the discussion. As a lead-up to that meeting, Dutton was scheduled to give her first talk to the business school faculty about her work related to compassion on the fateful day of September 11, 2001.\"I didn't sleep the whole night before, because I was so nervous,\" Dutton said. \"They cancelled the talk, obviously, because of the events that unfolded. But because I was supposed to give that talk, we had a new Dean [Robert Dolan] who learned I was doing research on compassion. There was no way otherwise that he would have known.\" According to Dutton, the dean contacted her that night asking for input on how he should respond to 9/11 in his leadership role. Dutton then wrote a memo and later spoke with the dean's leadership team. Having found that information useful, Dean Dolan asked if he could send it on to other deans throughout the university. That prompted the quick creation of a website called \"Leading in Trying Times,\" which was filled with advice for leaders from Dutton and her academic contemporaries on making a positive difference within the workplace after a time of trauma or crisis. \"That was pivotal in changing people's receptivity to ideas about compassion...We got 12,000 hits on that website really fast. It was this really strong message from the Universe that this way about thinking about management could be really helpful to people,\" Dutton said. \"So 9/11 was this huge catalyst to convince us, as a community, that this way of thinking about organizations could be really valuable.\" The Science Behind the Virtue According to Janet Max, POS projects coordinator, Dutton is thought of by everyone on staff as \"the heart of the center.\" \"She is passionately dedicated to making it be all that it can be... She just really believes, down to her soul, in what they are talking about here and wants the world to know,\" Max said. And while she may be known for her heart, Dutton's studies are scientifically based. According to Dutton, it is helpful to describe compassion as a process that includes noticing, feeling, and responding to others' pain. \"Leaders are really in a position to magnify the noticing, because everyone is looking at them \u2014 especially under conditions of stress and anxiety. People usually give up control and look to the top,\" Dutton said. \"What leaders choose to notice in those moments, how they express how they feel, and how they respond \u2014 little things and big things can be hugely consequential.\" In terms of how leaders within business organizations can respond in the most compassionate way, Dutton said that the most important thing is being there and showing that you notice. The second is to provide resources that can be emotional or material, and the last thing is to offer flexibility.

It doesn't matter what they produce.\" Continued on page 26 A2YOGA.NET 7 34.21 6.4006 2030 COMMERCE BL VD ANN ARBOR VOTED ANN ARBOR'S BEST YOGA STUDIO LIVING THE LIGHT WITHIN The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 26 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 27 Dutton pointed out that there is always pain in the human experience \u2014 and some organizations are able to work with that pain more effectively than others. According to her, compassion is not just an individual-to-individual thing but, rather, where a person works can make a difference in how compassion is mobilized. She then offered the example of a published study that she was involved with on the physician billing department at a Michigan hospital, where the staff collectively supported one another. \"Who would expect that, in a hospital...everyone would say, 'If you really want to study compassion, you have to go look at the physician billing department.' We were blown away. There was a huge line-up of people who wanted to work there. There were 20 people that worked there full time. People rarely left. The women would talk about going to work and learning to love,\" Dutton said. The staff demonstrated what Dutton's study described as having \"compassion capability\": showing a collective capacity to notice, feel, and respond to others' suffering. \"So by studying these organizations that are off the map in terms of being extremely compassionate and really competent \u2014 you just can see what is possible.\" Above all, Dutton said that her research over the years has convinced her that organizations can set up conditions to make themselves more effective in their collective good \u2014 and that leaders are only part of the story.Building the Business Case for Compassion Organizations that do not embrace compassionate behavior may run the risk of financial implications, according to a paper that Dutton collaborated on called, \"What Is Good Compassion at Work?\" In that paper, the following example was cited: \"A recent estimate by the Grief Recovery Institute showed that firms lose more than $75 billion dollars annually from employees' grief-related incidents \u2014 an estimate that is strongly suggestive of the ubiquity of pain in work settings and the corresponding necessity for compassion.\" And while some may look for quan ti fiable numbers, Dutton said that she doesn't feel the necessity to link compassion with an organization's bottom line. \"I feel like things like compassion or forgiveness, or all of those virtuous human capacities, are good in and of themselves. It doesn't matter what they produce. These are things that cross so many religious and philosophical traditions ...It doesn't matter if it creates good business results. So sometimes, I'm conflicted; I'm ambivalent about the need to justify it, because of the good it does,\" Dutton said. To make the case for compassion in work organizations, Dutton prefers to have people think of personal examples. She said that people know from their own experience whether they were treated in a positive, caring manner, or not \u2014 and that has an impact on their willingness to exert effort. \"Small acts of kindness or genuine responses to people \u2014 we think of them as minor, but those are the things that people remember. They are the things that breed loyalty and engagement,\" Dutton said. Dutton also made the point that compassion isn't \"soft,\" in that it enables companies the capability to take more risks to do great things. \"Organizations are now being expected to do more with less. And if you think about compassion as a healing force, there is always going to be wounding. And the harder [that] organizations are trying to do anything, there's going to be wounding. So in addition to all of these things that are happening in their lives, people are wounded at work - when they are trying to do new things and they fail, or they offer new ideas and they don't get accepted. But in order for an organization to be really good, people have to put themselves out there. They have to be willing to take risks \u2014 and compassion is this natural healing force,\" Dutton said.Dutton's Influence In terms of Dutton's self-perception, she describes herself as a researcher and says that most of her influence is on doctoral students and trying to influence the field of management. One person who has felt that impact is Amy Wrzesniewski, associate professor of organizational behavior at the Yale School of Management, who still collaborates with Dutton on research projects. Wrzesniewski, who has known Dutton for 18 years, first began working with her as a doctoral student at U-M. She said that Dutton has been an incredibly inspiring mentor to herself and countless others. Together, Dutton and Wrzesniewski worked on the study of people employed as hospital cleaners that was instrumental in leading Dutton to study compassion. \"The work that we started was a big gateway for her, in terms of changing a lot of the focus of the work she was doing,\" Wrzesniewski said. \"It was exciting to watch.\" Dutton's work on compassion has since expanded to focus on the power of positive relationships at work, positive identities and meaning, job crafting, and resilience. Her recent books include Positive Organizational Scholarship (Berrett-Koehler, 2003), Exploring Positive Relationships and Organizations (Lawrence Erlbaum, 2007), and Exploring Positive Identities and Organizations (Routledge, 2009). Dutton is also actively behind the Center for POS's mission of \"fostering research and building the community of POS researchers worldwide; teaching POS principles; engaging in research and publishing and presenting results; and producing teaching cases and other materials that exemplify POS principles.\" The three key areas Dutton focuses on related to POS are: research, teaching courses, and co-developing tools and small interventions that are meant to foster flourishing. She also tries to help other researchers and teachers benefit from the ideas and practices that flow from POS. One place where Dutton's POS contributions have been felt collectively is by thousands of U-M's employees, as she has worked with Associate Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer Laurita Thomas to contribute to the university's human resources efforts. Specifically, Dutton offered Thomas consultation that Thomas found to be \"foundational and fundamental\" about a tool to support employee engagement called \"Voices of the Staff.\" \"I attended the course that Jane teaches about Positive Organizational Scholarship and we just continued to have discussions about how a university as large and complex as ours could, in fact, create a process or a system whereby employees could comment and have input into things that mattered to them the most,\" Thomas said. \"Voices of the Staff is now sought-after advice...National meetings have requested our presentations and several universities have come here to consult with us on our process and how it might apply to their own university.\" Thomas, who has worked with Dutton for eight years, credits her for helping the \"Voices of the Staff\" program enjoy success because of her \"openness and willingness to advise and consult.\" Within the classrooms of U-M, Dutton teaches mostly in the Masters in Business Administration (MBA) program. She also has a POS elective that is about building high-quality connections, called \"Managing Professional Relationships,\" and also teaches in the Multidisciplinary Action Projects (MAP) program. Re-Balancing the Scales Going back to my original question: Why does compassion seem to be largely overlooked in the working world? According to Dutton, \"Psychologists will say that our brains are hard-wired for compassion. And the problem is that through various institutions \u2014 sometimes our families, sometimes our schools \u2014 we unlearn it.\" Yet, Dutton cautioned, if we think in terms of self-interest versus serving others, or competition versus compassion, that practice is not sustainable. \"It is partly about the yin and the yang. The self-interest has just been the dominant theory in human behavior. We are finding more and more, with neuroscience, that we are as hard-wired to serve others as we are to serve ourselves. And I think as we flesh out more fully that the human condition is as much about others' interests as it is self-interests, then we can commit to more of a balance,\" Dutton said. \"We need both \u2014 not either/or. It is just that our society is tipped so much this way, and our institutions like the [stock] market, that the masculine dominates the feminine...Hopefully there can be a re-balancing, before we do too much more damage to the planet and each other.\" So how do we begin to bring back the equilibrium that so many in our society seem to be craving? After talking with Dutton, it's clear that one answer lies in promoting a series of positive qualities throughout organizations' corporate cultures, to re-balance the scales. \"Who would expect that, in a hospital...everyone would say, 'If you really want to study compassion, you have to go look at the physician billing department.' We were blown away. There was a huge line-up of people who wanted to work there.\" To make the case for compassion in work organizations, Dutton prefers to have people think of personal examples. She said that people know from their own experience whether they were treated in a positive, caring manner, or not \u2014 and that has an impact on their willingness to exert effort.\"In addition to all of these things that are happening in their lives, people are wounded at work - when they are trying to do new things and they fail, or they offer new ideas and they don't get accepted. But in order for an organization to be really good, people have to put themselves out there. They have to be willing to take risks \u2014 and compassion is this natural healing force.\"\"I think compassion is just a piece of this really healthy human community \u2014 a community where the quality of human connection between people is really like a healthy blood vessel. It is not only going to be compassionate, but it is going to have other things that are associated with good relationships. There's going to be high trust, there's going to be more play. There are going to be a lot of things that are signs of a healthy human community. Compassion is only one manifestation of a community that has healthy tissue. There are other things that are going to pop up \u2014 like innovation, things that are associated with human growth. It is healthy; it is not only going to have healing, it is going to have growth,\" Dutton said. Locally, according to Dutton, Zingerman's Community of Businesses is an example of a business that is interested in the positive perspective. A business case study was written about them by the Center for POS for instructional use. Dutton also said that members of her organization are working with companies on a global level to bring more of the POS Center's research into practice. Looking back to when I first pursued this story, I am glad to know now that, despite the discontentment surrounding business ethics and other related issues in our country, there is also a bright spot on the horizon where organizations can shift their gaze. To me, re-imagining today's business world means having organizations that can compete, overcome obstacles, solve problems, and post profits, while offering employees a healing spot to land when necessary. Maybe \"only the strong survive\" isn't wrong \u2014 but rather, how we look at what nourishes that strength that needs to be re-examined.

This surprises me, and not just because I know he has cancer. I know him as a musician, not as an athlete. As a teacher, he has a reputation for excellence. He is both patient and exacting. His students win piano competitions. I met him twenty-five years ago, when he became my son's piano teacher. The trips to Van de Vort's music studio \u2014 his living room \u2014 were weekly high points. He has two grand pianos, side by side, and something resembling a harpsichord. Technically, it's a Virginal, similar to a harpsichord, but the strings run across the back end of the keys, instead of parallel to the keys. When teaching, he sometimes calls it into service for students' edification. Sometimes, during lessons, he demonstrates a passage on the piano. Hearing him play is a thrill. Now, listening to him talk about his athletic pursuits, my ears perk up. I express surprise, and he responds with his hearty, trademark laugh. It's a sound that says, \"You're funny! You're good company!\" It is both cheering and gratifying. Van de Vort's conditioned body belies his age and ongoing medical battles. Being a Vietnam veteran, he receives medical care at the VA hospital. (He has no health insurance.) But he is open to other healing modalities. Ten years ago, after noticing a rise in his cholesterol level, he went on a strict vegan diet \u2014 against his doctor's advice. After nine months of tweaking the diet, his cholesterol level dropped low enough so the medical staff at the VA was surprised to learn he'd ever had high cholesterol. Five years ago, at age 60, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. His first impulse was to work with diet once again, but the cancer proved too aggressive. He still had \"a very clean vegan diet\" when, two years ago, he was diagnosed with a dangerous mitral valve prolapse. Open-heart surgery repaired the valve, and statins were prescribed. He resisted taking them until he discovered a good medical reason for doing so. Statins coat the blood vessel walls and help prevent plaque from breaking loose, which would cause more havoc. So he takes them. Since the statins also control cholesterol, he no longer follows a strictly vegan diet, but he remains largely vegetarian. \"Thankfully,\" says Van de Vort, \"the usual side effects of statins have not appeared.\" Adjusting to his physical limitations has been a challenge, and he has tailored his exercise regimen accordingly. For about six months following his March 2010 open heart surgery, he could not lift much weight or stress the muscles around his sternum for fear that the sternum might split apart. Currently, he says, his sternum has healed as much as it will. It is now at about 85 percent of its previous bone strength. He feels free to lift whatever his muscle strength allows. He still bikes and does moderate yoga, but he remains cautious. Van de Vort was not a candidate for chemotherapy while undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. Instead, he was given hormone treatments, \"a kind of oral chemo,\" he explains. But hormone therapy decreases bone density. \"When I go back on hormone treatment, I'll have to be more careful,\" he says, referring to his thinning bones and the potential for fractures. He adds: \"Learning how to live with chronic illness is part of the aging process.\" I ask him about the role that music plays in his life, particularly now, as he looks for balance amidst the turmoil of check-ups, fluctuating Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) levels, physical restrictions. \"Music isn't like meditation,\" he says, \"but I get lost in it. It's great fun to be so fully engaged. Teaching piano is the greatest thing I do in my life.\" These days, Van de Vort relaxes by making cappuccino with his new, elaborate machine. As we sit and sip in his cozy kitchen, I see the stone Buddha sitting serenely in his garden. I think about the fact that his yoga teacher is one of his former students, and that now, with roles reversed, the aging student accepts what he can and cannot do. \"Finishing the yoga classes was always a mild high,\" he notes. Over the years, he took up a number of other relaxing hobbies, including woodworking and quilting. A collection of his very large and intricate quilts was on display at the Power Center some years ago. \"I get fixated on a project for a while, and then it's gone,\" he says, referring to these hobbies. \"I'm not sure how long the cappuccino phase will last.\" For now, though, it provides the calming effect he seeks. Returning to the subject of exercise, he compares sports to music. Both are \"at once calming and energizing.\" Biking remains a favorite pastime, but between the snow, strength issues, and his post-surgical incontinence, his rides are reduced. \"The padding on bike shorts is useful,\" he says, referring to its absorbency. I am almost taken aback by his candor. Almost, but not quite; his openness has always been a trademark feature. It goes hand in hand with his warmth. He talks about the hot flashes he gets since taking hormones. He takes anti-depressants to counteract this side effect. He is not taking hormones just now, but without the anti-depressants, the hot flashes continue. \"The hot flash switch was turned on in my body when I started taking hormones,\" he says, \"and, curiously enough, when I stopped the medication, the switch ended up still being in the on position.\" He tells me that the VA system pays him for loss of sexual function as a result of the prostatectomy surgery. The VA also pays for his disability \u2014 for example, cancer, which is probably a result of being exposed to Agent Orange while in Vietnam. As we talk, he goes through a litany of medical terms and numbers. Currently, his PSA level is .13, but it went from 7 to 15 right before his surgery. That sharp rise is a telltale symptom of prostate cancer. \"Doctors are not sure what effects they will have when it comes to treating or curing cancer,\" he says. \"The VA allowed me to take my time in deciding about the treatment I wanted, and has been supportive of my judgments about treatment.\" Cancer is not a single disease. There are countless forms of cancers, and they respond differently to different treatments. But he has bumped up against other problems, too. One surgeon, urging an operation to create an artificial sphincter, informed Van de Vort that he would need to wear a catheter for eight weeks. \"Turns out I'd have needed only three days!\" he says. He declined the offer of an artificial sphincter. \"I'm too active for a lot of these treatments.\" Keenly aware of the risks and dangers in surgery, he sifts through his options carefully. He has become something of an expert on his condition, and he has sought second opinions. He has been part of two cancer support groups, where emphasis is placed on being one's own best advocate. \"Most of the groups' participants used some form of alternative medicine,\" he says. His first group, at St. Joe's, was for patients with prostate cancer. He recognizes that for many men this group is successful, but for him it was not as helpful as the second, \"mixed\" group at the Cancer Support Community of greater Ann Arbor. He was the only male. \"They were much more open,\" he says of the women. The support groups inspired him to make his will, something he had not considered before. His pianos are willed to the Ann Arbor public schools. His woodworking equipment will go to schools in Saline. He arranged for two friends to have power of attorney: one for health, one for money. He was also urged to look to the community for support. He did, especially for his post-operative phases. \"I had a cooler on the front porch, and meals would be delivered two and three times a week.\" He was a strict vegan during that phase, and people prepared food accordingly. He could collect the meals when he felt able; he was not forced to socialize when he needed to rest. He has a loyal community of student families, musician friends, and grateful followers for whom he has done much. Strickfaden Photo. com\"I feel a sense of belonging here. I embrace this community. I integrate people into my life.\" He keeps his balance by staying busy and volunteering. Last year he received the Distinguished Service Award from the Music Teachers Association for so many years of service. At the moment, he is co-chair of the committee organizing a state-wide conference for music teachers, to be held in Ann Arbor. He has served as webmaster for the local Music Teachers Association, and he has done a good deal of judging over the years. He's organizing another \"monster concert\" with other members of the Ann Arbor Area Piano Teachers Guild. It will feature eight pianos on stage, played in unison, and will take place either in the fall of 2012 or 2013. \"It's an interesting celebration of piano playing. The sound of many pianos being played at once is funny.\" He notes that there are many pieces written for two pianos, and some for four. More can be a cacophony. Still, it's a \"celebration.\" The volunteering is, for him, a natural outgrowth of his personality and his need to belong; to be part of community. \"It's time consuming but rewarding,\" he says. I ask how his medical adventures have affected his teaching. He replies: My style has changed. I allow people to find their own mistakes, rather than correcting them so quickly. It's the carrot and stick approach to teaching. I don't think students have noticed the change. One student remarked recently that arpeggios were 'so easy.' He didn't realize how much time he'd been working on it! Another student, high school age, doesn't listen to himself. He's too eager. I told him: Your parents are renting my ears for an hour each week, so you should probably trust my ears when I tell you something is rhythmically uneven. In general, though, I think that these days I am learning more from my students than I am teaching them. I always assumed that Eric Van de Vort grew up playing piano. I am surprised to learn that he turned to piano as an adult, upon returning from Vietnam. \"I found a great teacher,\" he says, \"and I practiced eight hours a day.\" He had been in the 101 st Airborne Division Army band in Vietnam, playing the cymbals in surreal surroundings. After committing himself to the study of piano, he asked his teacher why he'd taken on such a novice. His teacher responded: \"I could tell you were sincere.\" Sincerity is a hallmark of Eric Van de Vort, and it shows in his philosophical manner. He ponders his own reactions to the various crises of recent years and says: \"You don't know what you'll do in a pinch. In Vietnam, I was not often in harm's way, but sometimes I had to go out on patrol, carrying a rifle. Those were dangerous situations. If I'd run across Viet Cong, would I have shot them? I'll never know.\" He remains humbled by that mystery, and it serves him well in the face of current danger. Eric Van de Vort exudes a sense of calm \u2014 a healing commodity. He chuckles to think he was once an in-your-face activist for gay causes. Gone are the days when he wore t-shirts emblazoned with \"QUEER.\" These days, he is without a partner, but he is secure within himself, and he has a solid place in the community. To look at him, one would never guess that he is, in any sense, ill. He looks and sounds as though he will outlive all of us. But as his body discovers its mortality, his spirit has found a gentler place. He is mindful of the gifts he's been given and grateful to share them. How lovely when such a big heart is matched by such abundant talent. ### For more information about Eric Van de Vort's piano studio and private lessons, please visit his website, sites.google.com/site/vandevortpianostudio.

Strickfaden The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 30 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 31 Over the years you may have seen local activist Rev. Joe Summers in protest demonstrations or at meetings advocating for progressive social causes. While many know him as the Vicar of the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation on Lohr Road across from Kohl's Department Store, his service to the community has an impressively broad reach. His leadership roles include Program Coordinator for the Oasis Transgender, Bisexual, Lesbian, and Gay Outreach Ministry, the State Co-Chair of Inclusive Justice: Together in Faith, the Community Co-Chair of the Washtenaw County Michigan Prisoner ReEntry Initiative Program, and the facilitator for Common Ground for Peace and Justice in the Middle East of the Interfaith Council for Peace and Justice. Rev. Summers is a calm, thoughtful man who laughs easily and who clearly enjoys his work. He first came to Ann Arbor as an undergrad and masters student at U-M, leaving for a while to attend Yale Divinity School, and then remaining here more or less for forty years. He currently lives on the south side with his wife of 22 years, Donna Ainsworth, and their children, Ruby (19), Kate (16), and Dylan (16). I recorded the following interview recently in my kitchen. Karl Pohrt: 2012 marks the 25 th anniversary of your ministry at the Episcopal Church of the Incarnation. Could you describe the church and its mission? Rev. Joe Summers: The Church of the Incarnation has attempted to be a center for the kind of spiritual renewal that undergirds social change, a place where people can express their gifts and a place where people of all ages can help one another heal and grow whole. It's a place where people stand up against injustice and for the marginalized and the oppressed. Incarnation means the spirit becoming embodied in flesh or action, so it's a perfect name for what our congregation is about.We're also an Episcopal church and the Episcopal Church is an important voice right now in this country and around the world in terms of being a church that embraces paradox. Because it grew out of the wars between Protestants and Catholics in England, we embrace tradition like the Catholics and we embrace reading the scriptures like the Protestants. We also embrace reason rooted in experience, like the Unitarians. All our liturgies are rooted in rituals that are thousands of years old, but at the same time we modify and innovate them so they speak to our contemporary condition. In 1984, three diverse groups came together to start the church. There were people from St. Andrews who wanted to create a new experimental kind of church. There was a group of black Episcopalians who wanted to start a new congregation. And finally there were people in the broader community who were social activists or who just found their way in. When these people came together they talked about what they wanted to do as a community. They focused on working with people in prison and coming out of prison because it connected with their concerns about race, women, and poverty. Given our geographical location in Pittsfield Township, we were close to the County Jail, the Huron Valley Men's Prison, the Huron Valley Women's Prison, and the Juvenile Center. It felt like a way to be rooted in our local community. From the beginning it was envisioned as a church without walls, a church that would be much more connected with what was going on, that wanted to make a difference in the world and in the community. In the first several years of the church's life, it met in a variety of places. I think it might even have met at the mall for a while. I know it met at the airport. It was called the Church of St. Airport in a newspaper article. When I came the congregation had been meeting at the Pittsfield Grange for a year or two. At that time, David Byrd, who was a local black architect and the director and founder of the Construction Technology Program at Washtenaw Community College, began to build a chapel with his students. Just after they finished the building he died of a sudden heart attack. His widow Letitia Byrd invited us to begin worshipping in the chapel. There had been a strong bias in the congregation against owning church buildings and doing property maintenance. This changed immediately when people entered this graceful environment that had been constructed out of discarded and damaged building materials by minority students at Washtenaw Junior College. Our congregation had a lot of extroverted energy and we needed to nurture the contemplative side of our lives.We've always drawn people who came out of oppressed backgrounds and various difficult life situations, and so to have this beautiful environment was very healing for people. One of the first big paradoxes of our life was that a church without walls ended up having property and taking care of property. Karl Pohrt: Your congregation has been involved in a variety of controversial social issues. Over the years these issues have shifted, which is a reflection of the congregation's interests. Rev. Joe Summers: Part of the formative energy that gave rise to Incarnation was the Liberation Theology movement that emerged around the world in the late 1960s and 1970s. These were communities that encouraged people to do church and do theology from the bottom up and to learn to see the world through the eyes of oppressed and marginalized peoples. It also emphasized reading the scriptures together and then collectively reflecting on what was going on in our world and what we might do about it. Both that way of seeing the world and the practice of reading the Bible together were formative for the church. But certainly what we do as a church comes out of the discussions of those who gather there. We did weekly Bible studies in the prisons for more than ten years. That was a way of seeing the world through the eyes of people who were mostly poor and hadn't been successful in our system. Fairly early on in one of our vestry meetings somebody said that we really needed to have gay and lesbian people in our congregation. One of the members of the vestry said, \"Well, I'm a lesbian.\" People said, \"Oh, okay. Great.\" And that began to make the discussion much more open. We sponsored Jennifer Walters, one of our members, for ordination. She was the first openly lesbian person to be ordained in our diocese. Her ordination ultimately led the bishop to face heresy charges, and his verdict of innocence helped open the door of the national Episcopal Church to allow for the ordination of gay and lesbian people. Her ordination and all the publicity in the newspaper made Incarnation a symbol for people who wanted a Christian community that was welcoming and affirming of all people, whatever their sexual orientation. Betsey Barlow, a member of our community who taught English in Lebanon, got us involved with supporting the Sabeel Center in Jerusalem, an ecumenical theological organization working toward non-violent change in Israel and Palestine. Our church also initiated the Nicaragua Project to promote sustainable economic development in the second poorest country in Latin America. We intend to build a cultural exchange center and an eco-hotel in Catarina, a small town in the mountains north of Managua. Some people in the congregation have struggled with mental illness and addiction. We've been welcoming and affirming and in solidarity with them and the struggles they face. Jesus said when you have a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, and the lame. He cited those folks because they were the people excluded from communities at that time. It's largely been the groups who have been excluded who have been drawn to our church. They are looking for community and they want to make a difference in the world. Karl Pohrt: What has formed or shaped your own sense of religious vocation?Rev. Joe Summers: My parents always took us to church in a poor community. I grew up in a predominately African American Episcopal Church in St. Louis, Missouri. It was a church where I came to know the pain of de facto segregation that existed in St. Louis at the time. A black child in the parish was hit by a car during a church service and the hospital across the street would neither treat him nor take him by ambulance to the hospital where colored people were treated, and he died. The high school youth, including my sister, Mary, responded to this incident by accepting Martin Luther King's invitation to create the Beloved Community. She and other high school youth went to Selma and Montgomery. Seeing the world of segregation overthrown permanently marked me. I realized the world could be radically different from what it was. One of the things that draws me to Christianity is that all the different kinds of oppression have become encoded within the Christian tradition. Rather than wanting to run away from that, I find that wading into the tradition allows me to confront and undermine the attempts to justify various kinds of oppression and horror in the name of Christianity. Jesus said when you have a feast, invite the poor, the maimed, and the lame. He cited those folks because they were the people excluded from communities at that time. It's largely been the groups who have been excluded who have been drawn to our church.Rev. Joe Summers Recommends: Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Paulo Freire.

[My friends] turned to me and jokingly told me that I had to take care of the religious sphere. That got me thinking. If institutional religion is a part of what's maintaining an unjust status quo in the United States, how could I contribute to changing that? Photography by Joni T. Strickfaden StrickfadenPhoto.comThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 32 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 33 When I was in high school in Rochester, New York, I got involved in the anti-war movement and the struggles there around racial injustice. Again, this was a very powerful experience of change. I was going to an inner city high school where there was terrible inter-racial violence. Being part of the Beloved Community with a group of Episcopal high school youth and working to change the world with them made a huge difference for me. I went through a detour when I got involved in the Catholic Charismatic Renewal. There were some very positive things about this experience, but it ended up teaching me a lot about what I didn't want my faith to be about. I was helped through this by coming to know Dorothy Day, the founder of the Catholic Worker Movement. I was an undergraduate at the U of M and during my winter and spring holidays and summer I'd go work at St. Joseph's House or St. Mary's House in New York. Dorothy Day was an enormously important teacher for me. What she read and talked about I read \u2014 Martin Buber, Dostoyevsky, the Personalist Philosophers \u2014 a wide range of non-violent activists and theorists. In my first semester at college, I had a course called \"The Struggle for Liberation in Latin America\" that introduced me to the emerging Liberation Theology movement, and the work of Paulo Freire. This had an enormous impact on me. I went to graduate school in American Culture here at the U of M. I felt I was learning lots of things that were really important in terms of what was going on in American society, what was wrong, but I also felt I was getting more and more disconnected from any kind of base through which I could make this knowledge relevant or act on it. In a crisis, I dropped out of graduate school. At the same, time I found that there was a growing dialogue and activism at St. Andrews, my local congregation. A lot of the things that had seemed most exciting about life on campus I now found at St. Andrews, when Jim Lewis, a new minister, arrived. He was very controversial, but in his time here the Breakfast Program started, which is still the main program for feeding the poor in our area. The Shelter for the Homeless started, which I eventually became the coordinator of. The whole parish was involved in this community discussion about homelessness at a time when Reagan wiped out all the low-income housing. While I was at St. Andrews, I went to a conference on Christianity and Socialism that Michael Harrington and others had organized. I met Dorothee S\u00f6lle, Carter Heyward, Rosemary Ruether, Cornel West, and a number of people doing Liberation Theology. I felt that what I'd been doing in graduate school was similar to what they did, and that I had a base to work on these things in the world. That's what led me into considering doing work in the church. I asked Cornel West what he thought. He told me he agreed with Martin Buber that the Spirit moves in times of crisis. I recall him saying, \"We're in a time of great crisis and I think if you look back historically at least part of the church has been open to the Spirit through the ages.\" That was good enough for me. I went on to Yale Divinity School largely because Cornel West was there. I mentioned that I started reading Paulo Freire in my freshman year Spanish class, and he became more and more important to me as the years went on. He is a key thinker about what empowers people to change and to make structural changes. He gave a seminar at the U of M when I was in graduate school in which he said that things in the United States were never going to change unless the religious sphere changed. None of my friends in the seminar went to church. They turned to me and jokingly told me that I had to take care of the religious sphere. That got me thinking. If institutional religion is a part of what's maintaining an unjust status quo in the United States, how could I contribute to changing that? KP: What's it like to do this ministry in Ann Arbor?JS: In seminary I worked in a Puerto Rican parish in New Haven, Connecticut, which I think is the seventh poorest city in the United States. When I came back to Ann Arbor I felt a little bit like I was moving to the other side of apartheid. It just seemed so wealthy and prosperous in contrast to where I was working in New Haven, but through the parish I came to know a different side of Ann Arbor than I had known during my life at the university. I loved my life in the university, but when you're inside that institution it's easy to forget that, say, one out of four Ann Arbor youth qualify for free school lunches or reduced price lunches. Side by side with the university community is a whole different community that really struggles. I still love the wonderful gift of being in an area with the U of M and EMU. Ann Arbor is a crossroads where you can meet and talk with people from all over the world, which is tremendously exciting. However, I'm very happy grounded in this other world, this other community, which is the community of the industrial Midwest. As near as I can tell, our current politics has not figured out how to address the decline and decay of the middle class in the Midwest and the devastation that has happened in the lives of the poor in this part of the country. So I think it's a really good place to be. KP: The Episcopal Church, like all religious organizations in the United States, has experienced a significant decline in its membership. How do you explain this? JS: I think there's a lot we still don't know and don't understand. Most of our denominations are really ethnically based. The Episcopal Church was the church that came out of England, just as the Presbyterian Church came out of Scotland. Our churches have had a hard time opening up and welcoming real ethnic diversity. That's part of it. What's striking is that while seeing the decline of almost all denominations in the United States, you have the same percentage of the public claiming to be Christian. Clearly we have a whole lot of folks that think of themselves as Christian who don't participate in church life. There's a lot of alienation from religious institutions. I believe Christianity is a communal practice, a community practice, and so I think it's a sign of how much is not being understood. I do think the traditions of radical individualism combined with the enormous social dislocation of a culture where your average family moves every six months makes it terribly difficult to maintain and nurture community. On the other side, I think that most churches with congregations that aren't simply about maintaining their parishioners' place in the social hierarchy have tended to be fairly small. Historically lots of churches were about fifty people, and as you look around the world today, that seems to be a fairly average size of church communities. It may well be that 50 to 150 people is the size that really works. There was a time when anybody who wanted to be president needed to be Episcopalian. That time is long past. In contrast to many denominations, the Episcopal Church stayed in the cities and we're now one of the denominations with the lowest per capita income. So, these are very interesting changes, changes that to me may be about decline but may well not be. We'll see where it all ends up. KP: Organized religions are under attack by New Atheists like Christopher Hitchens \u2014 and many others \u2014 for abusing their power. I'm thinking about the various financial and sexual scandals. That's had a very negative impact. JS: The Second Vatican Council said that some people are called to atheism as a way to witness against unjust visions of God. I love that. I have profound respect for many atheists, but I have trouble with the dogmatic atheism that I hear a lot about lately, just like I have trouble with religious dogmatism. That kind of quest for certainty is the opposite of where we need to be. Does this response honor life in the midst of a world that is as complex and mysterious as the one we find ourselves in? There is no question that abuse and horror can go on in religious institutions, actually in the name of anything \u2014 in the name of love, in the name of science. We've witnessed it all over the last several hundred years. There's no ground we can stand on that is neutral or apart from this kind of horror and suffering. One of the things that draws me to Christianity is that all the different kinds of oppression have become encoded within the Christian tradition. Rather than wanting to run away from that, I find that wading into the tradition allows me to confront and undermine the attempts to justify various kinds of oppression and horror in the name of Christianity. We cannot afford to forfeit these vital life giving traditions to those who are dogmatic or who are using them for oppressive purposes. KP: You talk to a lot of people all the time. What do you think people are looking for in a spiritual community these days? JS: Over time the church has become much more an expression of community. I fear that some people are drawn to churches that help them stay disconnected from their feelings. They are not interested in dealing with the world and its conflicts. They seek easy answers rather than the deep hard work of real religion and real spirituality. On the other side, I talk to more and more people who are really looking for authentic community, looking for spiritual renewal that makes a real difference in their daily lives, that helps them as they live out their vocation in the world. That's the wing of the church I'm interested in. I think the current generation has had very little experience of community because there's been so much fragmentation. Either we've had this model of leading very individualistic lives, protecting ourselves from community, or we've come out of spiritual traditions that are collective and deny individual autonomy. Being in healthy relationship with other people is a rare experience for most people. Connected to my sense of authentic community is a vision of relational truth. We had a former presiding bishop who said, \"The risen body of Christ comes into existence when I share the truths that are within me and open myself to the truths that are within others.\" He was describing the creation of a collective relational truth that no one of us can individually possess. This issue of the practice of community is fundamentally similar to Gandhi's notion of the pursuit of truth. Again, this is so different than the kind of individualism that claims that individuals have the whole truth. And it's so different than collectivism, which claims that somehow the collective has the truth and your individual truths are irrelevant. So there is this very humbling process of coming together with other people, trying to be open to listen and let what they have to say transform us, while also affirming and sharing our own truths. And by the way, I do believe in an ultimate truth. I just don't believe any one of us can individually ascertain it. I think our best hope of perceiving ultimate truth is through this relational truth. This is hard for people to understand if they're not from a traditionally religious background. Their instinct is to want to find places that reinforce their own thinking or their own feelings. Feeling supported is important, but it's not everything. I think religious traditions also confront you with the importance of up-againstness, the importance of listening to voices and perspectives that aren't yours, that take you into a broader universe. That's one of the things about these ancient rituals that you're continually confronted with. Why over hundreds and thousands of years have these words spoken to people and what do they say to us now? It's that tension between the past and the present that I think leads to this deepening. I love Alice Walker's statement \u2014 \"If we lose the voices of our ancestors we become thin as ghosts.\" This is something that we're always threatened with in the eternal present that is created by our media. All the major religions are trying to help us to understand this vision of the Way of the Heart, but they're all trying to help us understand it because it is clearly so difficult to live. It's much more complicated than it sounds. Dietrich Bonhoeffer said that any true community includes the person you least want to be in community with, which points to how seriously he took this vision. We need to be open and expand ourselves by letting ourselves be challenged by the person we least want to be challenged by, to the person we least want to struggle with. All that runs so counter to a society that seems to want to pursue endless comfort, to never feel uncomfortable, let alone have to really struggle and suffer by being in relationship or be challenged by somebody else. Most folks who walk through the door of our church have experienced being abandoned or ignored or judged or condemned by a community, so you can understand why people experience it as a real risk. But for me, the rewards of community far outweigh the bad experiences we've had. KP: What is your own spiritual practice?JS: Jesus was about a Way of the Heart, and he taught that pursuing the Way of the Heart embraces paradox. Part of the paradox is that the church is a church of acts. It is known by what it does. And simultaneously, it is a church of the spirit and the practice of contemplation. When we forsake either side of that paradox, when we're not acting in the world, our contemplation becomes shallow and not grounded in reality. When we're not taking time to practice inner silence, our activism ends up superficial and doesn't get to the heart of the issues. We're in a time where a lot of the rationalist modes of thinking that came out of the Enlightenment seem to be inhibiting our ability to deal with the complexities of who we are as human beings and our experience of the world. I'm extremely committed to rational thought and rational traditions, and at the same time I think part of what draws people to religion and religious traditions is they're hungry for metaphoric language. This language often seems to be missing from much of the social sciences, Community and the Way of the Heart Continued from Page 31which then makes it difficult to capture the width and breadth of our experience. I continue to encounter this hunger for language and vision that can help us speak to what we're really experiencing. KP: I think religion provides us with a language to talk about our experience in certain ways. If you don't have that vocabulary, the conversation is impoverished. What matters is having language and a place where people can talk about the issues that are closest to us. JS: Or strive to do it with all their heart and all their intellect and all their strength rather than just superficially. KP: This is essential to what it means to be human. JS: And yet there is a kind of paralysis that seems to exist in so much of our country. My intuition is that it is very connected to people feeling thwarted in their desire to lead meaningful lives. Somehow that desire to lead a meaningful life has gotten twisted and distorted. People have despaired of it so they're no longer engaged in the process you're talking about. When we come together with others to reflect on these deep questions, it gives us enormous strength and encouragement. One of these issues is finding the living language that speaks to us, that helps us to understand what's happening in our lives and the world. There's a connection between that living language and the practice of silence. My personal practices as I try to live this Way of the Heart are structured by our weekly coming together in communion and in thanksgiving. And my week partly also then involves reflecting on whatever scriptures we're going to be reading on the upcoming Sunday and reflecting on how they may speak to me and how they may speak to others. Increasingly, contemplative prayer is important. We have a group that meets every week called the Practice of Presence, which includes time for silent contemplation. That's a very important anchor. Deep conversations are equally vital to me. Out of deep conversations comes that living language that helps us to discern, that helps shed light on a situation, and helps to engender creative ideas. And with you, I share reading as a vital part of my spiritual practice. Reading is a way of being in dialogue with the world and others. I realize that for me the heart of any spiritual practice is whether it helps you to listen and helps you to see. You can't listen if you're all jammed up in your own thoughts or what's going on inside of you, and this is where the practice of inner silence becomes so important. There are all sorts of things that get in the way of seeing clearly. This is one of the places where Liberation Theology \u2014 learning to see things through the eyes of others \u2014 is such a vital spiritual practice. Acting in the world is also a vital part of my spiritual practice. Of course, we often fail in what we're trying to do, but that opens up new insights regarding what we're about and where we are. Where I live I can't settle on any one practice, but I'm very clear that everything Jesus was doing was about forming a community with a small group of people who then were in relationship to the broader community. If you take that tradition and make it all about just you and God, you've distorted things incredibly. I love the Hebrew vision that what we're struggling with is to stay alive. We have this tendency to fall into idolatry, which means to become people with eyes that can't see, with ears that can't hear, hearts that can't feel, and mouths that can't speak. So all these practices are about staying alive, staying living in this mysterious, fluid, complex reality we call the world. ### For more information about Rev.

Their use is so widespread that synthetic chemicals now contaminate all global ecosystems and can be found in our food, drinking water, household dust, and in us. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regularly monitors over two hundred environmental chemicals in a representative sample of Americans and finds widespread exposure to pesticides, plasticizers, flame retardants, tobacco smoke, and metals. Our exposures differ depending on our occupation; whether we live in a highly polluted community; what we eat; and how we live \u2014 but we all carry this load. We know from animal experiments, and from some human data, that industrial chemicals can increase the risk of common diseases and conditions. The rates of some cancers rose in the last two decades, including kidney, liver, thyroid, esophageal, and testicular cancer in men; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, liver, and kidney in women; and childhood cancers, especially leukemia and brain cancer. The strength of evidence linking environmental exposures to these cancers varies from limited to strong. Recently, the President's Cancer Panel summarized its investigation into the evidence linking environmental chemicals to cancer, and concluded that, despite remaining uncertainties, the contribution to cancer has been grossly underestimated, and that we know enough to act. It's not just cancer. The scientific literature identifies more than one hundred industrial chemicals \u2014 many of which are commonly found in the workplace and home \u2014 known to affect the human brain and nervous system, causing memory, cognitive, and functional symptoms. An extensive 2008 review concludes common chemicals like lead, other heavy metals, PCBs, particulate air pollution, solvents, and some pesticides can increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders, including cognitive decline, dementia, and Parkinson's disease. We know that hundreds of chemicals can exacerbate asthma and may be implicated in its cause. And, of course, people are exposed to chemicals, and people differ in important ways that can influence how chemicals behave in our bodies. We can be experiencing psychosocial stress or have poor nutrition, a compromised immune system, or a genetic predisposition to greater vulnerability. Scientists are beginning to use ecosystem models to understand how complex interacting factors, including chemical exposures, can lead to disease in humans. Yet, the federal government does not effectively regulate industrial chemicals. It is a widely held myth that manufacturers have to do extensive safety testing before introducing chemicals into the products we buy. They don't have to, and most won't disclose the chemicals in their products. A number of authoritative reports have documented that our chemical regulatory system is old, outdated, and never functioned properly to begin with. And this failure to regulate has meant there has been no incentive to innovate, so the domestic chemical industry hasn't. But environmental health activists have a plan. They have been going directly to companies demanding they make products without harmful chemicals. Activists have convinced the electronics, building materials, health care, cosmetics, children's products, automobile, and cleaning chemicals sectors, among others, to reformulate products using safer chemicals. Environmental groups are now doing their own chemical testing and telling the public about harmful chemicals in everyday products. One of the nation's premier testing projects is located here in Ann Arbor, the Ecology Center's HealthyStuff program, which provides a searchable database of chemicals of concern in consumer products. There's been action in statehouses all over the country and in Congress too. In the past decade, over eighty chemical safety laws have been passed with an overwhelming margin of bi-partisan support in states including Michigan, even in a recession. Here in Michigan, we've passed laws restricting lead in children's products, mercury, and some of the worst flame-retardants. Federal legislation has also been introduced again this year. While the chemical industry would have us believe that such laws are anti-business and anti-profit, plenty of progressive businesses understand that change is inevitable. A number of prominent business groups are now advocating for reasonable regulations on chemicals because they are concerned about the health, reputational, and business impacts if the products they use or sell contain toxic chemicals. If you make and design chemicals that are safer from the outset, you can actually cut the costs of regulation, hazardous waste storage and disposal, worker protection, health care costs, and future liabilities. That's another prong in the plan to transform our economy so all of the \"stuff\" we use everyday is safe for people and the environment. We need to transform the design of chemicals and materials up front, before those chemicals are in widespread use. A set of ideas developed more than a decade ago provides the tools to do just that. Those ideas, called \"The Principles of Green Chemistry,\" are revolutionizing our approach to making things. The basic idea is simple: Make chemicals and materials that are safe for health and the environment using the safest raw materials, and the safest and least energy intensive processes. The revolution will only be as good as science education and business implementation. Science teachers at all levels are starting to teach these principles, including those at all of the major research institutions in Michigan. But we are far from integrating these principles into science education across the board. The most innovative businesses have started to adopt these principles too, but still, too many lag behind. Michigan was ahead of the curve when the governor signed the nation's first state- level Green Chemistry Executive Directive in October 2006. The directive included an award for the design of safer chemicals and materials, and celebrated Michigan companies, educators, and activists driving this change. And we've started to see the change. Nearly every Ford vehicle coming off the line these days has a soybean-based foam seat. The soybeans are farmed in the United States replacing three million pounds of petroleum every year. A large auto supplier developed a safer chemical used in Michigan assembly plants to paint cars \u2014 it's made out of old lobster, crab, and shrimp shells. This replaced a chemical that was a suspected carcinogen. And KTM Industries in Lansing is making packing materials for Volvo out of cornstarch, from U.S. grown corn. This packing material can be composted after use. Beyond the auto industry, Wayne State University has developed a novel way to create biodiesel cost-effectively from used cooking oil. A Detroit firm is using soybeans and old tires to make new heating and ventilation seals. University of Michigan researchers developed a process to make a high production chemical without the use of hazardous chemicals, replacing them with water. Michigan-based Herman Miller is a leader in sustainable furniture manufacturing and Michigan State University opened the Bioeconomy Institute in 2009 to incubate new Michigan businesses in bio-based chemicals and materials. Many manufacturers of children's products, from infant car seats to toy manufacturers, have removed lead and other hazardous chemicals from their products. Even Walmart implemented a plan to reduce hazardous chemical usage. While we haven't arrived yet \u2014 the next step will be to develop materials using agricultural waste products farmed sustainably \u2014 the changes are important and encouraging. All of this change is driven by small actions by lots of people. You can get involved by joining the Michigan Network for Children's Environmental Health (www.mnceh.org), a coalition of environmental, faith, health professional, and health-affected groups working for change in Michigan. You can write to companies that make your favorite products asking them about their commitment to Green Chemistry and sustainability. You can research products using the Ecology Center's HealthyStuff.org website before you buy them and then take action. You can ask the science teachers you know if they are teaching the Principles of Green Chemistry. In twenty years of advocacy on this issue, things have never looked this promising. There is momentum to transform our economy so that it is safe for everyone \u2014 not just for consumers and communities \u2014 but also for workers all over the world who make the products we use every day. ### Tracey Easthope, M.P .H., is the director of the Environmental Health Project at the Ecology Center in Ann Arbor.

GREEN LIVINGHealing from PTSD: Rebuilding Veterans' Lives with Dignity Syndy Sweeney Talks with Neuropsychologist Dr. Eric Amberg, Occupational Therapist Karen Jones, and Stiggy's Dogs Founder Jennifer Petre about Changing Views of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and New Methods for Healing our Soldiers The May 2010 Memorial honoring Ben P . Castiglione in Howell, Michigan Corpsman: Jason Deguzman, Jimmy McRedmond, Beau Parks, Michael Camacho, Jeff Mancino, Chris Brewer, Tommy Peterson Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Benjamin P. Castiglione The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 35gentle pressure. Then, she moves outwards from the head and spine to work with the fascia, or connective tissue. Covering the nerves, organs, and muscles like cling film, fascia can easily be moved out of place with trauma and guided back to where it should be with experienced hands. To further open the fluid flow of the body, es-pecially around the head and neck, Jones does a specialized massage called Manual Lymphatic Drainage. As she works, the patient may also release long-held emotions associated with the trauma and healing; Jones then incorporates Emotional Freedom Technique, acupressure on the emotional points of the body, to further this release. Because the endocrine system is continually compromised and sugar intake taxes an already stressed brain, Jones knows there are also bound to be nutritional deficien - cies. She looks at the diet of the patient and recommends appropriate changes. With every touch and every tool at her disposal, Jones requires feedback from her patients, guiding her to what needs to be released next. Patient responsibility then becomes the most important therapy. Dr. Amberg agrees. One of the greatest impediments to healing veterans is that once they become patients in a conventional system, they are required to relinquish their responsibility for their own well being. Suddenly, highly trained warriors who are used to having an objective to fulfill a mission are reduced from an active role to a passive one. Rather than participate in their healing, the veterans look on as their symptoms are treated with both medical opinions and drugs that may be in conflict with each other. As patients, veterans begin to lose their warrior identity. This loss compounds what was already lost in the war, and many veterans feel they have nothing to live for. Working with veterans for most of his career, Amberg is concerned because the suicide rate of veterans is on the rise. Therefore, he is embarking on a pilot study with six veterans (with a larger study to follow) called the Life Reacclimation System that will look at veterans not just as a series of separate symptoms or diagnoses that have the stigma of mental illness, but holistically. Specialists in Physiatry (physical medicine), Endocrinology, Neurology, and Neuropsychology will help Amberg gather measureable results, such as hormone levels, about what is occurring biologically in the veterans' bodies. In addition, bodyworkers will incorporate yoga and many of the same modalities that Karen Jones uses to help release the brain and body from the hold of PTSD and phantom pain. Finally, Amberg will use a biographer who will work with the veterans to help them discover their innate gifts. By doing so, the focus on the biological changes that have occurred in the body move into the background, al - lowing the veterans to have something to look forward to and to live for. The ultimate goal is to get the veterans back on track: to educate them about what has happened biologically in their bodies, to help them \"recognize the nature of their alterations\" and incorporate them \"into the process of rebuilding,\" and to give them the tools they need to take ownership of their mental, physical, and even spiritual health. According to Amberg, this integrated approach should allow the veterans to achieve healing within two to three months. This short timeframe may sound like a miracle to a veteran who has been suffering for a long time, but Amberg's previous experience with veterans has proven that his system can be effective. Karen Jones's techniques also bring about quick healing. Most recently, she helped a veteran who had broken his neck in 2006, when an IED blew up too close to him. To protect the soldier's privacy and to honor her own father who had suffered from his experiences at the Battle of the Bulge in World War II, Jones refers to him as Jess. With Jess's permission, Jones chronicled his trauma and treatment in a blog called \"Our Soldier\" on her website (www.karenjonesot.com). Upon meeting Jess, it ap-peared there was nothing wrong: he did not move his body as if it had experienced trauma. Yet, Jess suffered from back pain, nightmares, excruciating headaches that felt like an ice pick in his head, vision problems, and jaw grinding. Treated for over three years by the VA, Jess was brought to an Ann Arbor rehabilitation brain injury facility for a six-month pilot study. Still in pain and feeling he was going crazy, Jess was referred to Jones. Within a month, over the course of six treatments, Jones helped Jess to release the pain his body held onto for nearly five years. As Jones tells it, Jess's sharp head pain was \"...minimal. The back and neck pain: minimal. The nightmares: gone. The jaw grinding: gone.\" Now that most of his pain has disap - peared, Jess is finally able to rebuild the rest of his life. Thanks to innovators like Karen Jones and Dr. Eric Amberg, there is now awareness that PTSD and phantom pain are a matter of biology. With this awareness, there are now effective ways to treat the veterans who are suffering. With these tools, there is now hope. And with hope, the most important mission can now begin: rebuilding veterans' lives with dignity. ###The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 37 Dr. Eric Amberg is embarking on a pilot study with six veterans called the Life Reacclimation System that will look at veterans not just as a series of separate symptoms or diagnoses that have the stigma of mental illness, but holistically . In the end, it is the brain and the chemical processes and not mental illness that prevent a person from moving forward. Feature Continued on page 38 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 36 By Syndy SweeneyPhoto by Susan Ayer For a veteran suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) or the phantom pain associated with the loss of a limb, pharmaceutical drugs may lessen symptoms but ultimately, they do not cure. The PTSD and the pain remain; and life becomes one of bouncing between medications in a circle that leaves the veteran feeling, at best, crazy, and at worst, hopeless. Yet, there is hope. By redefining both the trauma that veterans have endured and the ways to treat them, two specialists from Ann Arbor \u2014 Karen Jones, an Occupational Therapist, and Dr. Eric Amberg, a Neuropsychologist \u2014 are succeeding with veterans where conventional methods have failed. Amberg was raised in the Bronx, got his master's degree at City College, and received his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from MSU. He has worked with veterans for 30 years. Jones had a father who struggled with post trauma symptoms from the Battle of the Bulge. She has been committed to finding effective ways to ease pain and suffer - ing that stem from memories earlier in life. As a rehabilitation therapist schooled in craniosacral work, her treatment techniques gave rise to implementing craniosacral therapy at the Joyce Massey Traumatic Brain Injury treatment center in Ann Arbor. In addition, she had started one of the first lymphedema clinics in the Midwest, and is a practitioner of Qi Gong. The key to their success is that Jones and Amberg do not treat PTSD and phantom pain as psychological disorders (although with any trauma, there is a psychological component) but as physical ones. \"I need people to understand they're not crazy,\" Amberg says. Whether a limb has been severed or a veteran's system has been shocked by being too close to an Improvised Explosive Device (IED), the body and brain both have undergone severe physical changes that must be addressed. In the case of phantom pain, the motor cortex of the brain still maintains its connections; as far as the brain is concerned, the missing arm or leg is still attached. In PTSD, when trauma is experienced, that trauma becomes the most powerful memory in the brain. From then on, the body and brain react to additional stimuli, such as noises, lights, crowds, and smells, in relation to that specific memory. In this reaction, the brain dumps chemicals into the body and, according to Jones, the person \"becomes at the mercy\" of his or her body. The endocrine system, which controls the hormones, becomes out of whack. Adrenalin rushes into the body, trig - gering a release of glycogen from the liver cells. Glycogen converts to glucose, which floods the brain. The pancreas then overreacts and unloads insulin into the body. The glucose quickly drops and the brain senses that it is starving. Starvation triggers only one result: very real fear. Worse, the specific areas of the brain that are involved with trauma \u2014 the hippocampus that deals with memory and the amygdala that controls basic survival \u2014 swell and literally become like two gears locked in place. The cingulate gyrus, which normally deals with the learning process during trauma, also enlarges and keeps things in a repetitive state \u2014 like when the needle gets stuck on a vinyl record and cannot move on to play the rest of the song. In the end, it is the brain and the chemical processes and not mental illness that prevent a person from moving forward. How then do the brain and body unlock and help move a person beyond the trauma suffered? \"Physical trauma requires hands-on physical healing,\" says Jones. To treat phantom pain, Mirror Therapy is utilized. For example, if the right arm was the one removed, a person uses Mirror Therapy with the left arm. While \"...looking in the mirror, the mirror images the right arm working. So that image visually remaps the sensory cortex of the brain for the right arm.\" This remapping allows the sense of pain to dramatically subside or even disappear permanently. For PTSD, the ultimate goal is to \"...take the memory that's so excruciatingly pro- found in the body and move it from an area of memory from the front of the brain to the back of the brain so the brain isn't constantly reacting to that memory.\" She does this by first calming down the nervous system with Craniosacral Therapy. Feel-ing for imbalances in the flow of fluid, muscles, and temperature along the bones that surround the brain and the spine, Jones is able to release those imbalances with Healing from PTSD: Rebuilding Veterans' Lives with Dignity \"I need people to understand they're not crazy.\" - Dr. Eric Amberg With every touch and every tool at her disposal, Karen Jones requires feedback from her patients, guiding her to what needs to be released next. Patient responsibility then becomes the most important therapy.Within a month, over the course of six treatments, Jones helped Jess to release the pain his body held onto for nearly five years.Dr. Eric Amberg and Karen Jones The Episcopal Church of the Incarnation Welcomes You!

Called Doc Stiggy by his fellow Marines, Castiglione had been deployed for the second time when he was killed. Doc had welcomed this deploy - ment for the opportunity to once again take care of \"his men.\" Now, his aunt takes care of them. At the time of Doc's death, Petre was working with the Huron Valley Humane Society. Witnessing firsthand the capabilities of dogs, Petre had begun fostering and training dogs to make them more adoptable when she received that fateful call. After several months had passed, Petre knew what her nephew's legacy would be: she would res-cue dogs and train them to rescue veterans who were suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Stiggy's Dogs was born. Originally beginning in a rented warehouse with an area set aside for sleeping, Stig- gy's Dogs has become an around-the-clock adventure for Petre and her Director of Training, Donna Fournier. Sacrificing time for themselves and their families, as well as income, the women are supported purely by donations. Stiggy's Dogs rescues mostly medium-size dogs, focusing on temperament and energy rather than breed, and at a cost of $6,500 per dog, trains them as Psychiatric Service Dogs (PSD). Initially, in preparation to receive the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) certificate (American Ken-nel Club's program for responsible dog ownership), the dogs spend 120 hours in a controlled environment. They learn basic obedience and how to interact with sights, noises, other animals, strangers, and children. After this basic training, the dogs are then ready to meet and train with their veterans. Before this meeting, the veterans must undergo their own process. Beginning with an application, the veterans must have a doctor's note requesting a Service Dog as well as a diagnosis of PTSD, TBI, or other related anxiety disorders. Stiggy's Dogs then interviews the veterans and their families to determine what their specific needs are and if a Service Dog would be a good fit. Once a veteran is approved, he or she must go to the training center and be prepared to work with his or her dog for up to six weeks: bonding, passing the CGC together, and then specific task training which var - ies with each veteran's needs. According to Petre, as a condition of PTSD, it's difficult for many veterans to leave their homes or sleep well. Because a dog can sense a change in body language, energy, and anxiety levels, task training may include waking up the veteran during a nightmare, acting as the \"wingman\" and performing a perimeter check so the veteran can sleep, nudging the hand or climbing into the lap as a distraction, or even giving a \"nuisance signal\" in which the dog begs to be let out to save the veteran from the embarrassment of needing to leave a crowded area. More importantly, with the dogs, the veterans can begin to return to a sense of self, remembering the things they enjoyed before they experienced war. Things like riding a bike, fishing, and rollerblading. Or in the case of Faith Harris, an Air Force veteran who served in Iraq, being able to watch her son's baseball games from the stands rather than from the safety of her car. Suffering from PTSD, the medications Harris took made her \"separate from the world.\" A fellow veteran recommended Stiggy's. After a few months' wait and only two weeks of task training together, Faith and Honor, a Lab/Husky mix, went home. With Honor, Harris is able to be distracted from her episodes of depression and anger, to sleep, and has significantly reduced the dosages of her medications. She says, \"Stiggy's Dogs is such a big help to a lot of veterans.... I know it changed my life completely. And I'm truly grateful for that.... It doesn't just stop once you leave with your dog. It's a family. That's huge.... It's not your typical, 'Here's your dog, have a great day.'\" And family is really what Stiggy's Dogs is about. While veterans must pay their way to the training center \u2014 although Petre hopes to change this with donations of frequent flier miles \u2014 once they are there, their lodging, food, and training expenses are covered for the duration of the training. The VA Medical Center in Ann Arbor is also supportive: Petre helps veterans navigate the center with their dogs, and in the case of out-of-state veterans, the VA has made it possible for them to receive their medication and counseling during their stay in Ann Arbor. When the training is completed, to ensure the maintenance of the dogs' welfare while relieving additional stress on the veterans, the dogs, which are already vacci-nated and spayed or neutered, take their bowls, toys, service vests, heartworm pills, leashes, and crates with them. Petre also continually checks in with her veterans. Sometimes those calls are painful: like when Faith Harris had a run-in with K-Mart management who told her she shouldn't have a Service Dog because she wasn't blind and threatened her with handcuffs if she didn't leave. But most times, those calls, e-mails, and many Facebook pages filled with happy photos of her dogs and veterans help Petre heal. With each dog rescued and each veteran helped back to life, Stiggy's Dogs has given Petre an ever-expanding family she never anticipated. The reason behind it all \u2014 both the heartache and the moving forward \u2014 is Doc Stiggy himself. His presence is still felt. His aunt knows he's \"still helping his fellow veterans even now and that's what he'd want.\" Stiggy's Dogs is located at Stiggy's Sanctuary, 2610 Bowen Road, Howell, MI 48855.

Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Benjamin P. Castiglione (3rd from left) and the Delta Company, 2nd Marine Division, 2nd Light Armored Reconnaisance Battalion Marine Expeditionary Force Helman Province, AfghanistanBy Barbara Brodsky What follows is a new essay in an occasional series by Barbara Brodsky about her trips to Brazil to visit the Casa de Dom In\u00e1cio. The Casa is a healing center headed by Jo\u00e3o Teixeira de Faria, affectionately called John of God. Medium Jo\u00e3o serves as a channel for approximately 31 different entities that incorporate into his body, one at a time, to do what often seems to be miraculous healing work. Jo\u00e3o has been doing this work for over 50 years, with international visitors who often find healing from diseases like cancer, MS, and AIDS, as well as other physical, emotional, and mental disorders. Barbara Brodsky is a teacher of Dharma and Vipassana meditation, an author, the channel of a being called Aaron, an ordained interfaith minister, and the founding and guiding teacher of the Deep Spring Center for Meditation and Spiritual Inquiry in Ann Arbor. She became totally deaf in 1972; living with silence has greatly influenced her life and teaching. Her last report on her healing journey with John of God appeared in the December 2010 issue of the Crazy Wisdom Community Journal . Many readers have followed my stories of trips to Brazil and rejoiced with me when there was increased hearing. Now you see me on the street and stop me to ask, \"What happened this year? Did you hear more?\" It's a hard question to answer. Each trip to John of God's Casa de Dom In\u00e1cio is different. And, of course, when we ask for our highest needs to be met, and for what best serves all beings, we're likely to get what we need and not what we think we want. This was my experience. In January 2011, I went with expectations of new learning, profound experiences, and perhaps increased hearing. I had a wonderful group of 20 people accompanying me, for whom I served as a guide. I looked forward to the time with them. During the five-week trip, there would be time to stand under the waterfall and relax with that beauty and purification; ride a bike down flower-edged lanes; swim in a sunlit pool; visit with friends; sit at the Casa meditation overlook, with its vast views, and rest in spacious awareness; and, of course, work with the Casa Entities and sit in their Current room (the name they give the meditation room, where the incorporated Entity sees and works with people). The final two weeks, more on my own, I could focus even more on meditation and silence; I would work with the Entities and the beautiful energy there, for healing and growth. The first two weeks were lovely, a wonderful time for my group and me. It is a delight to bring people there, introduce them to this magical place, and see them blossom. The Entities also were working on me frequently, and I could feel the positive results: sinus congestion of months gone the first day, as I sat in the Current; knee pain gone following two surgeries that the Entities performed on me completely energetically, with no incision or human touch. These were also done in the Current room. And it seemed like every time I walked into the Casa area, the Entity incorporated in Medium Jo\u00e3o's body appeared, and said, \"I want you in my Current.\" The heart opening in these situations was profound. One day, I was sitting outside the surgery room to pick up a man in my group after his operation. I was one of about a dozen people sitting on the benches there. The Entity, incorporated in Jo\u00e3o's body, opened Jo\u00e3o's office door and called to me. I went to him and he brought me into Jo\u00e3o's office. It was the beloved Entity I have come to know as Dr. Valdivino. While each Entity who incorporates in Medium Jo\u00e3o's body looks like Jo\u00e3o on the surface, each has his own clear facial expressions, ways of moving, and personality. Even the eyes change color! With time, one becomes able to distinguish one Entity from another. In the Current room, some of them also announce themselves by name (although that doesn't help me, since I don't hear). For about four minutes he held both my hands, and looked in my eyes with deep compassion and loving-kindness, talking all the while. My mind was spinning, trying to get what he was saying, frustrated because I so badly wanted this opportunity to converse and could not understand anything. I was experiencing grasping, instead of the joy of his presence. When he paused, I interrupted and said, \"Eu sou surda\" (I am deaf) but, of course, he knows that. \"Eu n\u00e3o falo portugu\u00eas\" (I don't speak Portugese). He just nodded, smiled, and resumed talking. At that point, the cognitive mind shattered and my heart listened as he continued to speak words I could not hear, in a language in which I'm not fluent. There was no thought at all. I could feel and allow the unconditional love that flowed from him. The concepts no longer mattered. My heart heard him perfectly. After a few minutes resting in his love and with his continued words, he led me to his Current room. Another day, I waited in the Main Hall to go through the line and ask a question. This Hall is where people gather and wait each day to pass through the line and speak directly to the Entity incorporated in Jo\u00e3o's body, to present their needs and hear what the Entity wants them to do. He might tell them to sit in his Current, send them to surgery at the next session, or offer some other guidance. Sometimes, he simply says, \"I am helping you.\" At other times he may be very specific, such as stopping someone in line and saying, \"Do you want me to remove that cataract now?\" I have seen him take away someone's crutches in line, saying, \"You do not need these anymore,\" and watched the astonished person walk out. While I waited, the incorporated Entity came out on the stage. It was Dom In\u00e1cio de Loyola, the leading entity at Casa de Dom In\u00e1cio, which is named for him . He does not incorporate often. He looked directly at me, walked to where I stood by the stage, reached out his hand, and said (in Portuguese, which was translated to me), \"You know where I want you. Go to my Current.\" Each time I went through the line, the Entity would say, \"You know where I want you. Sit in my Current. I am helping you.\" I felt very seen and loved, though a little stymied, because I could never go through the line to ask a question. The point seemed clear; at some level, I already know the answer and it's usually ego asking. Trust and let go of the questions. As Ram Dass's new book title says so well, \"Be Love Now.\" Can we allow that love to be felt, allow ourselves to know our innate divinity, radiance, and perfection, even when the conditions don't directly seem to support it? On Thursday of the third week, the Entity sent me to surgery (unusual, while my group was still there). Two days before, I had developed a high fever, diarrhea, and nausea. Now I could do little but lie in bed, sleep, and toss fitfully in an uncomfortable body. The weekend passed and week four began. Mind kept going to, \"Not fair; this was to be my week to do my own inner work\" \u2014 ludicrous, when you consider that all that stopped me from doing that work as I lay in bed was my own racing mind and expectations. The cognitive mind shattered and my heart listened as he continued to speak words I could not hear, in a language in which I'm not fluent...The concepts no longer mattered. My heart heard him perfectly.The incorporated Entity...put his hand on my head for about 30 seconds. It felt like his energy was moving right through my skull and down into my heart. All tension released and I just began to weep softly, feeling deeply seen and embraced by that love.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 40 Continued on page 42 When we ask for our highest needs to be met, and for what best serves all beings, we're likely to get what we need and not what we think we want. This Little Light of Mine, I'm Gonna Let It Shine . . . .The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 41 Each day I thought, \"Tomorrow I'll feel better\" \u2014 and, of course, that thought aroused enormous grasping and suffering. The deep sense of being seen and heard gave way to old thoughts of being invisible and unloved. Although I was able to see those thoughts as just the unfolding of old conditioning, and let them go, they did return for several days. Gradually they ceased; the mind quieted, and there was just a feverish woman lying in a bed. Then came the next question, mind again racing: \"If I am seen so deeply, they know what's happening with me; they must intend the continuation of this fever for a reason. Maybe it's for some purification. Who am I to question it? Just let it be.\" But we always have free will and nothing ever happens without our agreement at some level. I did not choose to remain ill. At this point I dragged myself out of bed, and went to the Casa to go through the line and ask for help for the fever. Dom In\u00e1cio, on the stage again, took one look at me and sent me to his Current. \"He knows my needs,\" the mind argued, with the alternating, \"Why won't he let me ask for help?\" as I sat there in the Current. Of course, I was exactly where I needed to be to receive help, but the fearful side of me was filled with doubt \u2014 and that doubt blocked me from the real possibility of healing. My mind moved to an old story, as I sat there that morning: There was a man caught in a flood; he climbed to the roof of his house and began to pray to God to save him, and heard from God, \"I will save you.\" Shortly, a log bumped against where he perched at the rooftop. He thought about climbing on, then thought, \"No; God will save me.\" Next came a raft that was rescuing people. \"We have room; come!\" \"No,\" he said. \"God will save me.\" Finally a boat arrived, the rescuers inviting him aboard. \"No, God will save me.\" He drowned when the waters rose. He came to those \"Pearly Gates\" and asked God with anger, \"Why didn't you save me?\" \"Son, I sent you a log, a raft, and a boat. Why didn't you save yourself?\" What does it mean to save ourselves? Where is the balance between faith and action? If trust is there, from what would I \"save myself?\" How do I trust that all is as it needs to be, yet still act to \"save myself\" with love? This is the constant field in which we live, the balance of ultimate and relative realities. My meditation teaches me that we co-create everything. If I wish to hear, there has to be a conscious choice no longer to participate in the old stories of being shut out, deaf, or separate. Then I become aware of, and can more fully enact, that which already hears, just as I was able to open my heart and fully \"hear\" the Entity with my heart that day in Jo\u00e3o's office. We open to the already present reality without grasping, but always by inviting. I thought I was \"inviting\"; I thought there was equanimity. But there is a strong distinction between resignation and equanimity. Resignation is contracted, low in energy, and filled with grasping. It distracts us, so we can't experience the true equanimity that's already there. We believe, \"I must fix this contraction\" (illness, deafness, whatever), instead of just breaking through it. We may not over-identify with the body or mind, can rest in the loving spaciousness and ultimate reality of our innate perfection, yet we must still attend to the relative reality of our situation, and with compassion. True equanimity is what arose as I stood with the Entity holding my hands, yet with ears not hearing. The heart opened with love and awareness. There was compassion for the human who could not hear, and an intention to invite physical hearing. Now, sitting in his Current, there was much fear and doubt. Through the week, lying feverish in bed, I explored that line between resignation and equanimity, and how only true equanimity could allow choice from the place of love. Fear was not denied or extinguished, but noted with compassion, known for what it was, and seen and released, again and again. The illness continued. I took an antibiotic and the fever stopped, but I was very weak and still could not eat. Mind continued to leap back and forth from, \"I should have faith\" to \"I must fix this,\" until the duality of those stances fell apart. \"I must attend to this body with compassion, for it is experiencing severe illness,\" unified with \"In the long run, this is for the good, and that good will reveal itself. Release fear, and respond with compassion to the body's needs.\" Slowly, mind began to let go of attachment to outcome, and to just watch this whole progression of illness from a more empty place; to choose restored health and make skillful choices to support that intention, but also to nurture the \"don't know\" mind. In the big picture, I simply don't know. Things will be as they are, and my deepest well-being is not dependent on external conditions. I decided to return to the U.S. a week early; I wanted companions with whom to travel while still feeling so ill. By early March, I had been home for five weeks. The body was healing, yet for three-and-a-half additional weeks at home, there were still fever spikes, shaking, and body aches several times a week, and ongoing diarrhea. I slept; I meditated and was quiet. My doctor did tests that revealed nothing.Then I sent a photograph to the Casa, which is how the Entities evaluate and treat people long-distance. The Entity looked at it and said, \"Tell her I am taking care of her; not to be concerned.\" The next day, the fever and body aches stopped. They didn't return. The reason for them will likely remain a mystery; probably some tropical bug \u2014 unusual there, but certainly possible anywhere. The Entities certainly didn't cause the illness but, once present, they allowed me to experience the learning it brought. The gifts remain: Knowing the radiance of being, and skillful choice from the deepest place of love and emptiness, of which this heart is presently capable. The year rolled past. January 2012 arrived, and I left for Brazil with another group of 20 new and old friends, and again filled with hopes and plans. I love to bring people there and watch their progress. It's humbling and an honor to share their experiences; I truly love them all. For some of the group this year, trust was a primary issue. \"Is this real? Will I get the help I need?\" Each year, I advise people to ask once for what they need and then just sit in the Current and trust that they have been heard. Each year, people want to go through the line repeatedly and ask and ask again, \"Is it getting better? What is happening?\" What needs most to be healed \u2014 our cancer, torn knees, deafness, depression, and confusion? Or our beliefs that we are unimportant, not heard and attended to, not worthy of the healing we seek, and somehow lacking Divine radiance? Here is the basis of our impulses to control and fix, brought forth with much tension. How do we finally come to truly know we are loved, eternal, radiant, and beautiful, and let go of self-identification with the distortions that arise? Of course, we choose to heal at all levels, but I find it must start with letting go of old beliefs of a limited and damaged self, and opening to a deeper truth; that is so hard for many people. I know this, but here I was again at the Casa caught in the old beliefs. Each year it gets easier, but I still have much to learn about trust and remembering my own radiance. My first week there, I went through the line to say hello to the incorporated Entity and mention that my vision was deteriorating. I also asked for help with several other physical issues. I don't know which Entity was incorporated. There was no smile, or taking of my hand, as is usual. He just nodded and said, \"Sit in my Current\" and I was pointed to a seat. That afternoon, as I returned to the Current Room as requested and sat in the front row, I felt a little ignored from the morning's lack of greeting. Also, I was a little surprised he had not directed me to the afternoon surgery session. The line of people going to surgery had passed by about 25 minutes earlier. I meditated on any emotional pain from \"unseen; unheard,\" and let go of those stories. Now awareness What needs most to be healed \u2014 our cancer, torn knees, deafness, depression, and confusion? Or our beliefs that we are unimportant, not heard and attended to, not worthy of the healing we seek, and somehow lacking Divine radiance?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 42 was still and centered. It wasn't so much trust as resting in a state of knowing (versus trusting, which still is a \"doing\") that my needs were being met, just as I sat there. Knowing comes from a place of deep stillness, resting in the core of being. So I relaxed into sitting in the Current, at ease and free of thoughts. Suddenly there was a firm touch on my shoulder; I opened my eyes and a Current room volunteer said, \"Come.\" As I arose, I looked at the incorporated Entity sitting in his chair just before me; he nodded to me with a gesture to follow her, and she led me to surgery. At first I was surprised, then felt let down; the surgery period ended just three or four minutes after I arrived and I thought I had not really gotten any benefit. I went right back to my room and to bed, as one is directed to do. But the surgery on my eyes, shoulders, back, belly, and more, continued. I slept most of the next 30 hours, between energetic visits and continued work from various Entities. The clear reminder, \"trust; relax,\" was always there in the background. After someone has had surgery at the Casa, they visit the Entity for a review of that surgery one week later. The next session following that review, I went through the line to ask where the Entity wanted me. It seemed like a reasonable question at the time. Should I continue to sit in Current, have further surgery, or some other treatment? Father Francis Xavier was incorporated, an Entity whose energy and pure being I have come to love. I was almost scolded, as I was told, word-for-word from the translator, \"You know you are a Daughter of the Casa and I always want you in my Current, when not needed elsewhere; now sit here (pointing) .\" I sat down in his Current as instructed, and almost immediately felt the surgery anesthetic again and pressure, more work on my eyes. The anesthetic feels like being wrapped in a loving and protective cocoon, consciousness quieted, and body energy stilled. Body seems to disconnect from mind. There is drowsiness and lethargy. It is entirely energetic, not chemical in any way. Three more times through my five-week stay they did eye surgery on me in the Current room. Each time it was obvious to me and to others, as my eyes were extremely bloodshot for 24 hours afterward and I could not focus them. Yes, there was some added hearing, especially of music and laughter! I had the delight, one day as I sat in the Sunday morning interfaith service, to hear the melodic voice of opera singer Armita Nikdin \u2014 singing, what else, \"Amazing Grace.\" (It's the song that marked my first hearing two years ago, as reported in this Journal .) It was true grace and brought tears of joy to my eyes and gladness to my heart. I was reminded in that hearing to keep my heart open and trust this process.Throughout these weeks, when the Entities were not working on my eyes or body, I was offered many kinds of instruction as I sat in meditation in the Current. Predominant was mediumship training. This may come as a surprise, coming from someone whom many of you already think of as a medium, but my understanding of that term was vastly expanded through these five weeks. Incorporating Aaron (the entity that I channel) is easy now. I just release my consciousness and invite him in; he does most of the work. In the Current, with my eyes closed, I repeatedly was invited to observe the layers of energy fields as people passed by in line; a radiant core and then the levels of spirit, mental, emotional, and physical bodies, and to observe any streaks or shadows in those levels, noting any diminishment of expressed light. I found I could \"see\" the areas of distortion, and also see the simultaneous ever-perfect, free of distortion, just as I was doing for myself with vision and hearing. It felt like I was being led to shine a light on each passing person, to reveal both the distortions and the radiance, and to invite each person to take up the radiance as he/she passed by. It corresponded perfectly with the practices in which Aaron has been training me for the past two years. The work is never to \"fix\" or \"do,\" but just to hold the compared experience of how things are, along with the highest intentions and knowing of innate perfection, and to invite the shadow to release into radiance. I was reminded of a large fallen tree beside the path at my Michigan cabin, and how I loathed the messiness of it each time I walked by. It took me several years to see the perfection; tree-life disintegrating into rich soil, to support future life. Both were there together, of course: the mess with the richness and perfection. As they instructed me, they were truly healing my vision, teaching me a new way of seeing, to see the simultaneity of the ever-perfect radiance and the lower vibrational bodies, hold the vision of \"ever-perfect\" as a reminder of what's possible, and offer the invitation to each being to express the highest possible radiance and truth. This became my personal ongoing practice through these weeks: awareness of any diminishment of my own light, any places of subtle contractions of fear, aversion, and so forth, and letting go into the highest possible openness and vibration. But I am a slow learner (aren't we all?), and doubts still crept in; wanting to make it this way or that; control; fear! On my next-to-last day, I thought to walk through the line to ask about the continuing shoulder pain and the status of my vision. My alarm was set for 7:00 a.m., to have time to get to the Casa for the morning lines. At 6:00 a.m., the Entity Dr. Augusto (at least, it felt like his energy) nudged me out of sleep and said, \"You still don't trust me. I am not like the human who makes promises and forgets, and needs to be reminded, prodded. When I make a promise, it is never disregarded. I know your needs; now go to my Current. I have work to do with you there.\" I could only laugh. How clearly he reads me! Six years ago, he said to me after an accident in which I partially lost my vision: \"You will not be blind.\" And again, several years later, \"No more eye surgeries and injections in the U.S.; I am taking care of your eyes.\" Yet there is still fear and grasping. He was right; I was not fully trusting. He doesn't forget, but I do. Spirit, our own higher selves, and those who lovingly guide us, can be trusted to co-create with us, as long as we are clear in our own intentions. I got to the Main Hall about 7:00 that morning and sat on the step by the stage. Almost immediately I felt the surgery \"anesthetic\" and then a lot of pressure on both eyes. I felt very dizzy, weak. It lasted until just a minute before the Current Room door opened. I was woozy and asked if I should return to my pousada (hotel). The Entity said, \"No; you know I want you in my Current.\" I needed support to walk to my seat, but got there. So I sat in the Current. Hour one brought more surgery on eyes and elsewhere; hour two, sleeping; hour three and on, deep quiet. Toward the end of that session, the incorporated Entity, Dr. Augusto, walked up to my seat in the front Current row and put his hand on my head for about 30 seconds. It felt like his energy was moving right through my skull and down into my heart. All tension released and I just began to weep softly, feeling deeply seen and embraced by that love. It was a potent reminder of the power of letting go of old stories, old conditioning. Letting go is hard, but it really is all there is; inviting the release of ego's voice, over and over; resting in the radiant core of our being; trusting our deepest intentions for highest good, and that we are all cherished. We can follow this path of presence, unconditional love, and freedom. ### Barbara Brodsky's book Cosmic Healing: A Spiritual Journey with Aaron and John of God (North Atlantic Books, March 2011) describes her experiences at the Casa and discusses many aspects of healing in great depth.

Continued from page 41 This Little Light of Mine, I'm Gonna Let It Shine . . . . The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 43 By Amy B. Garber Photography by Susan Ayer P .T. Barnum, Elizabeth Shue, George W. Bush, Robert Frost. I found my friend, chiropractor Rob Koliner, intent at a computer at the front desk, looking at a parade of portraits of famous people. It had been years since I'd seen him \u2014 and I ran into him because I had an appointment with an energy worker who had just moved into the Center for Sacred Living. Rob is a chiropractor and a practitioner of NMT (NeuroModulation Technique) and NAET (Nambudripad's Allergy Elimination Technique) through his From Within Healing Center. His practice is located in the Center for Sacred Living on Little Lake Road, where Rob is also the co-owner. The multidisciplinary CSL was established in 2001 to house a variety of alternative and complimentary healers in one location, for ease of patient access and exposure to new treatments. After doing some personal catching up, Rob shared with me that he is practicing a new modality about which he is really excited: AtlasPROfilax \u00ae. It turns out that the people in the photos he was scrutinizing on the computer all had something in common: their head was tilted slightly to the right. \"There's a reason for this,\" Rob said. \"The top bone in the neck, called the atlas bone, is like a pedestal and the head rests on it,\" he explained. \"The atlas bone is the first cervical vertebra. In most people, the atlas is dislocated or crooked \u2014 so, usually, their head is going to be tilted and sometimes crooked, too.\" Rob explained that the AtlasPROfilax treatment corrects this dislocation by moving the atlas bone permanently back in place. It is a one-time treatment done with a special tool, for which he took a week-long training to learn how to use properly. As of this writing, he is one of only 13 practitioners in the United States who have been trained to give the AtlasPROfilax treatment. Rob showed me his flyer, which had before-and-after graphic images of a skull: one with a crooked atlas bone and the other with the atlas bone in proper alignment. \"When the atlas is dislocated,\" explains the flyer, \"it chokes off signals between the skull and the rest of the body. Nerve supply, blood flow, lymph flow, and cerebral spinal flow are all compromised.\" According to Rob, this disruption causes stress to the body and contributes to physical ailments and illnesses. After repositioning the atlas bone, Rob said, the place where the spinal cord goes through the opening in the atlas bone into the skull is no longer partially blocked. The spinal column can better receive the signals from the brain, and all types of healing and improved functionality can take place. The depth and type of healing depends on the person's anatomy and varies widely. \"As we are all shaped differently on the outside,\" states Rob's flyer, \"we are all shaped differently on the inside. The compromise that the dislocation creates is different for everyone.\" People around the world who have received the AtlasPROfilax treatment have described broad benefits, including experiencing improved eyesight and neck function; cessation of back pain, sciatica, and numbness; realignment of the jaw; and relief from hip and knee joint pain. Rob told me he has seen even further compelling results. His experience correcting the atlas on a few people with Multiple Sclerosis, ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease), and Parkinson's Disease suggests that this treatment may slow the progression of these diseases, or at least the symptoms. Patients of Rob's with scoliosis, fibromyalgia, and other ailments have also experienced relief and, in some cases, what may be a reversal of their condition. As a result, a lot of people are becoming interested in this permanent correction. Rob's been traveling all over Michigan and Ohio to give the treatment since becoming certified four years ago. In particular, the treatment has been very popular with the Amish community. \"They really like non-drug health care, things that work,\" Rob explained. \"It's interesting, because most of the [American] population hasn't heard of this yet.\" As a result of a client in the Ann Arbor area, Rob has also been travelling to Jamaica a couple times a year to do AtlasPROfilax presentations, treatments, and re-checks for a growing community of patients there. Rob was gathering photos on the computer for a presentation he was putting together to promote the treatment. Once he pointed it out to me, it was funny to notice that all of the people in the photographs held their head tilted slightly to the right. I became aware of the ever-present tightness and pain in my own neck and wondered how out of line my own atlas bone was. I was very interested to learn more. ~~~~~~After his Atlas bone treatment, Rob said it \"looked like someone had taken off the blinders\" from his field of vision and he felt more connected with Spirit. \"I was already clairaudient; I hear information. But it was like somebody took the mufflers off, it got so much clearer for me.\"Chiropractor Rob Koliner Everyone who's ever been checked by Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcmperli or by anyone trained in the AtlasPROFilax procedure has been found to have their atlas dislocated. Except: Children whose mothers had their atlas fixed before pregnancy appear to be born with their atlas already in place! Continued on 44 \"Is Your Head on Straight?\" Probably Not, but a New Treatment May Fix That \u2014 and MoreThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 45 When Rob got in his car, he turned his head to look behind before backing up the car and heard a loud \"pop\" from his neck. He turned his head to the other side and the same thing happened. This was consistent with what he had learned in chiropractic school: If you can get the atlas bone straight, the spine should adjust itself most of the time. \"But I've been under chiropractic care for 25 years, and I've never heard my neck adjusting itself like that! In the first 15 minutes, my neck was already adjusting itself. I was very excited!\" Another change Rob noticed immediately was that it \"looked like someone had taken off the blinders\" from his field of vision, since the range of his peripheral vision had increased. (Approximately 1 in 20 people experience a visual improvement.) Finally, Rob said that immediately after his treatment, he felt more connected with Spirit. \"I was already clairaudient; I hear information. But it was like somebody took the mufflers off, it got so much clearer for me.\" Because everybody's body parts are shaped differently, what Rob experienced from his atlas correction may be different from what another person's experience may be. \"So I like to share my story to let people know what might be possible \u2014 but everybody has their own experience,\" Rob noted. Soon after his treatment, Rob signed up for the next available week-long AtlasPROfilax training, which was held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. ~~~~~~ The changes kept coming for weeks and months afterward. Rob's lower back used to go out on a regular basis. \"It wasn't real painful, and I could lie down and pop it back into place easily. But sometimes I needed to do this multiple times a day, which was annoying.\" Now, his spine is stable and rarely goes out of place. Rob likes to run, and years ago he noticed that one of his feet would point out about 30 degrees. He tried to be conscious of correcting this, but it was hard to check his feet while he was running! Six months after his atlas treatment, Rob noticed that both his feet are straight. And they still are, four years after the treatment. Rob had decided to investigate this as scientifically as possible, so he was determined to record all the changes he noticed in himself for months afterward. He also suggests this to his patients. What he doesn't recommend to others is another thing he did: \"After my atlas treatment, I stopped all bodywork and all supplements for about six months, so I could really watch what was doing what. Usually I get a lot of bodywork like cranial sacral, chiropractic, et cetera.\" Eventually, he went back to his supplements and occasional bodywork. Rob gives his patients a handout sharing what to expect after the atlas treatment, which mentions that sometimes receiving follow-up care is helpful: chiropractic, massage, acupuncture, or cranial sacral therapy. \"Sometimes the body starts unwinding and then it gets stuck and may need some help,\" Rob explains. ~~~~~~ The www.atlasprofilax-canada.com website explains, \"Noticeable reactions can sometimes occur either immediately after the application, [or] weeks or even months later...Diseases [and injuries] that are not completely healed can temporarily flare up again during the self-healing process.\" Two weeks after his AtlasPROfilax treatment, Rob's right shoulder got stiff, and stayed that way for a couple of weeks. The stiffness went away, then came back a couple months later, then went away for good. It turns out that 20 years ago, Rob had a bicycle accident where he flipped over the handlebars and tore some ligaments in his shoulder, leaving a bone that stuck up slightly. \"My body went back and healed the injury from 20 years ago \u2014 not 100 percent, but it's much, much better. I can hardly see the bump any more.\" Two months after Rob's treatment, it felt like someone stuck a needle in his left hip joint. He felt this pain twice the first day, once the next day, and then it stopped. About 13 years ago, while training for a marathon, Rob had injured his hip. \"For three months, I limped around until finally a chiropractor helped me resolve it,\" Rob said. He hadn't thought about it for 13 years, but had a reminder when his body went back to finish the healing. Rob cautions people that, after the atlas treatment, \"If you feel something \u2014 especially when it's a reminder of an old injury \u2014 and you want to see a doctor, then do that. But it may also be the brain telling the body to heal something that it didn't have the capability to heal before. The hole opens up around the spinal cord, where the atlas bone is, and the brain has more awareness of what the body is doing.\" \"So I've noticed changes on every level \u2014 emotionally, spiritually, physically \u2014 from head to toe.\" Although he noticed the most changes in the first several months, \"I'm still seeing changes. My whole system is transformed!\" ~~~~~~ Rob also shared with me numerous stories of healing from patients whose atlas bone he relocated. Some time after the atlas treatment, one man experienced severe leg pain for about 20 minutes and thought he had somehow re-broken his shin bone, an old injury. But then the pain was gone as suddenly as it had come, not to return.\"In most people, the atlas is dislocated or crooked \u2014 so, usually, their head is going to be tilted and sometimes crooked, too.\" - Dr. Rob Koliner Continued on page 46 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 44 Rob Koliner got into chiropractic the way many alternative healing practitioners do: by pursuing his own healing. Rob had been a computer programmer for over nine years when he was in car accident. Seeking pain relief, he went to a chiropractor but \"I didn't notice a lot of changes, and it seemed like he just wanted to keep me coming back,\" Rob said. Not ready to give up, Rob found another chiropractor who properly explained chiropractic to him and gave him the pain relief he sought. Rob thought to himself, \"This is it!\" He had been looking for a career he could be passionate about and knew he had found it. Fast-forward through four years of chiropractic school and 11 years of treating patients, to 2007. A friend of Rob's sent him an email asking if he knew anything about AtlasPROfilax. He didn't, so he went on the Internet to research it. He found good testimonials and was very intrigued. And yet it didn't make sense. Rob had studied the atlas bone in chiropractic school, and what he was taught didn't support the concept of doing a one-time treatment to the atlas. \"But something inside me said, 'This sounds really good.' I got excited about it, but at the same time my head was spinning because I couldn't make sense of it intellectually.\" On two different plastic models of skulls that Rob owns, he showed me that there are two little pointy bones on either side of the atlas, one on the left and one on the right, called \"the styloid process of the temporal bones.\" In untreated people, the atlas is stuck in front of the styloid process bone on the left. Rob pointed out on both skull models that, in fact, the styloid process on the left is leaning back slightly. Apparently, in the people from whom both models were created, the atlas was pushing that bone back. ( See photos below of these skull models. ) \"In chiropractic school, we studied the relationship between the atlas and the occipital bone, which is the back part of the skull that rests on the atlas. Unfortunately, the relationship between the atlas and the styloid processes was never mentioned,\" Rob explained. \"Even most skull models they sell for us to educate our patients have only the occipital bone on them, not the styloid processes. In those models, it looks like the atlas can move freely, but it can't. What I learned in chiropractic school is not correct.\" ~~~~~~ This is the same dichotomy that the originator of the AtlasPROfilax treatment, Ren\u00e9 Claudius Sch\u00fcmperli , found when he first investigated the atlas bone. Sch\u00fcmperli didn't go to chiropractic school, but had similar training in his native Switzerland from a Swiss chiropractor named Peter W. Huggler, who had studied at the Palmer School of Chiropractic in the U.S. Dr. Huggler was taught how to adjust the atlas bone by hand, which Rob said the Palmer School was focusing on at the time.Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcmperli had been ill most of his life, until he went to Huggler's \"Academy of Vitalogy\" and had his atlas bone adjusted chiropractically, or manually. He experienced such great effects that he went to the school to study the techniques himself. When Sch\u00fcmperli graduated and started treating people, the atlas bone was his focus. In everyone Sch\u00fcmperli checked the atlas bone was forward on the left side. But it didn't make sense to him why this should be so. He finally looked at a skull model with the atlas exposed and saw the two pointy styloid process bones that are adjacent to the atlas, restricting its movement. This proved that the atlas can't move the way his teacher was taught in chiropractic school. The skewed atlas bone was not the result of a subluxation (a slight misalignment, which chiropractors deal with) but an actual dislocation, a luxation! To put the atlas bone back in position, so it remained straight, Sch\u00fcmperli realized he needed to move it around the styloid process bone on the left. Between 1993 and 1996, Sch\u00fcmperli refined his technique and eventually had a special instrument designed to move the atlas permanently back into position with a one-time treatment. Sch\u00fcmperli calls the treatment the AtlasPROfilax and the practitioners who are trained throughout the world are called AtlasPROfs \u00ae. ~~~~~~ Once Rob read online about the AtlasPROfilax treatment, he wanted to learn more about it. On the AtlasPROfilax.com website, he saw that the nearest practitioner was in Cincinnati, Ohio. So Rob called the practitioner, Beverly Welbourne, and booked an appointment for himself. Rob told Welbourne he was there to check out the AtlasPROfilax procedure for himself. He had a lot of questions for her before the treatment. As is standard procedure, Welbourne also explained what she was going to do and what Rob could expect. He filled out some paperwork, and Welbourne performed some checks on Rob, such as his neck and spine, before doing the procedure. Immediately after having the AtlasPROfilax treatment, even as Rob left the building, he started seeing several positive changes in his body. First, he could move his head more easily, \"like someone squirted some grease in there,\" and the range of motion in his neck was greater. (Most people's range of motion of their neck improves afterwards.) After repositioning the atlas bone...the spinal column can better receive the signals from the brain, and all types of healing and improved functionality can take place. \"Is Your Head on Straight?\" Continued from 43 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 47 Three People's Experiences with Dr. Rob Koliner's Atlas Bone Repositioning Rob Koliner says that people's evaluation of their atlas treatment tends to fall into one of three categories. About 25 percent don't notice anything, or only minor changes. Half the people notice some good changes. Then the other 25 percent are \"just blown away \u2014 their entire life has changed!\" Rob thinks that people's experiences with their atlas treatment depend on many variables: their awareness of their body; how dislocated the atlas was to start with; the person's age, health, and mental state; and how well they take care of themselves (how often they exercise and what they eat). Little Change: Craig HarveyThe Canadian AtlasPROfilax \u00ae website states: \"The following rule of thumb applies: the more ill the body, the stronger the reactions will be.\" This statement may explain why Craig Harvey's experience of the AtlasPROfilax treatment would put him in the category of \"minor change.\" Craig, age 57, had his atlas relocated by Rob Koliner about a year ago. He saw a flyer about it at the Center for Sacred Living, where Rob's office is located, and was immediately curious. \"Of course I'd be interested in something that could potentially solve every problem in my body!\" Craig joked. He saw it as a basic, preventive procedure that could allow other things to work better in his body. \"But I also like to try alternative healing modalities periodically; I go through phases.\" Craig says that he has had all different types of energy work and bodywork over the years, but \"Most things don't seem to have a noticeable effect, other than a calming one.\" He had also been seeing another chiropractor for a couple years \"with no real benefit,\" but stopped around the time he got the atlas treatment. Craig tries to stay active and take care of himself: He lifts weights, walks and runs, and does heavy yard work. He didn't have any serious health complaints, but he had been dealing with tight muscles in one of his legs for the past five years. Sometimes, when taking a walk, it would bother him. Then he would stop walking, bend from the waist while dangling his arms, and it'd be better after a little while. This had also kept him from running in recent years. Did the atlas treatment help? Craig isn't sure. \"I started a serious stretching regimen, a couple times a day, and I think that's helped the most.\" He did start running again, but he's careful to stretch first. Again, he doesn't think the atlas treatment helped him to start running again, either. Craig says that he was paying attention, looking for changes. He did find he has a greater range of motion in his neck after the treatment. \"I think I'm essentially too healthy to notice anything,\" Craig finishes. \"But I'm sure I'll appreciate the difference when I'm 80 years old!\" And he thinks the cost was worth it, \"since this could be the last adjustment I ever need,\" he adds with a laugh. Major Changes: Laura WalinskyLaura Walinsky's experience was one of those that can be termed \"life-changing.\" She says, \"Of any medical procedure or treatment I've had in my life, this is the most positive experience I've ever had! I had such incredible results. I'm so thrilled.\" Laura, 53 years old, contacted Rob because she was having trouble with what she termed chronic fatigue. \"I could sleep 11 or 12 hours and still not want to get out of bed, still be every bit as tired as when I went to bed,\" Laura explained. It had gotten progressively worse over the past 15 years. Laura was on thyroid medication, which did absolutely nothing to help the fatigue. \"I kept complaining to my doctor all the time about being tired, but I don't think they knew what to do. Other than the thyroid medication, I hadn't done anything else. And changing meds did nothing to help.\" A friend of Laura's has been going to Rob for many years, and recently a couple of her other friends had the AtlasPROfilax treatment. When she called him, that's what Rob recommended. \"I was at a point where I was certainly willing to try alternative treatments, because I do believe in them. And I had nothing to lose.\" Immediately after having her atlas repositioned, while still in the office, Laura noticed a change. \"After the AtlasPROfilax treatment, Rob said my hip was no longer turned in and my legs were even. And walking out of his office, I almost tripped! Because it changed the way I walked.\" Then the next thing she noticed, and the most important, was that her energy level started picking up. Laura recounted that, the day after her treatment, \"When I woke up in the morning, it actually felt like I got a night's sleep. My body wasn't tired any more!\"That was four weeks ago. \"And since then, every day, my energy's been getting better and better,\" Laura said. \"I really don't sleep more than eight hours now, and I wake up refreshed. And I haven't felt that way in 15 years! I can't tell you how grateful I am for that!\" Laura works from home and only goes into the office once a week or so. \"When I went into work the following week, my coworker said, 'Oh my God, I can see the difference in you already!' and he asked me how to contact Rob's office. He had known I was going to pursue the treatment because of the fatigue, but he still couldn't believe it.\" Laura is also experiencing other positive changes. For instance, her eyesight is getting better. She also feels that she's breathing deeper, and she thinks that probably helps with the sleeping too. Also, she's not getting neck aches any more. Laura mused, \"It happens so gradually \u2014 you get used to feeling abnormal, I guess. Then when something like this happens and changes you, you all of a sudden remember, 'Oh my gosh! This is how I used to feel when I was younger, when I didn't have all those aches and pains!' \" She adds, \"I would have loved to have had this procedure 15 years ago.\" Laura said that she's looking forward to what else is in store. \"And it makes sense: If the body wasn't in the right position, it took many years for symptoms to develop \u2014 so it's going to take awhile to correct them. It's just the best money I've ever spent in my life! That much I know.\" Good Changes: Amy GarberAfter interviewing Rob about the AtlasPROfilax treatment, I decided to have the procedure done myself. I told myself that it was for journalistic reasons, but in reality I felt that it could have enormous impact and I was very excited about it! Not that I had many physical complaints. Other than chronic neck pain \u2014 at times so severe that I lived on ibuprofen \u2014 I am generally in good health and don't take any other medications. But I have a desk job and am on the computer at least nine hours a day, usually with little interruption. I probably should have been getting regular bodywork, but wouldn't afford myself the time or the cost. As Laura says, above, I slowly got used to the pain and discomfort and just lived with it. My appointment with Rob was in May 2011. He checked the length of my legs and arms (and, of course, they were not congruent). Then he checked range of motion in my neck, having me look as far to the left and right on each side as I could. When he physically examined my neck, he exclaimed that my atlas bone was one of the most misaligned that he'd seen! (Well, that could explain the severe neck pain I had that day and most days.) He also adjusted the C2 vertebrae in my neck and made some other tweaks chiropractically, in order to have the atlas treatment be more effective. To explain the procedure, Rob pulled out an electric tool different from the special one he uses for the AtlasPROfilax treatment and ran it on my leg, so I would know what it would feel like. (It felt like rapid pummeling.) He said that the action is similar during the atlas treatment, but that he is not supposed to show anyone the actual tool, probably so that it cannot be copied. When Rob started the procedure, he stood behind me and bore down with the electric AtlasPROfilax tool on the left side of my neck. There was no way I would have been able to see the tool from that angle. I remember thinking, \"Does he really have to push that hard? I'm just a small person!\" I admit that I have a low pain tolerance and, possibly also because my atlas was so far out of whack, it was pretty uncomfortable for about 30 seconds. When it was over, I felt a lot of energy being released from my neck \u2014 from the aftermath of being pushed so hard, or the relief of being put into alignment, I'm not sure. My neck felt really tingly, actually buzzing, and yet at the same time I knew it was going to be sore. (The soreness went away after a day.) Rob checked the lengths of my arms and legs again and pronounced them to be balanced. The range of motion in my neck was much better and I had no pain at all on the right side any more! As I left Rob's office, I felt a general light-headedness and kind of spacey, almost like I was in an altered state. I was trying to be aware of any other changes, remembering what Rob experienced immediately after his own treatment. I didn't think I noticed anything else, until I got home. As I walked into my laundry room from the garage, I was hit by the powerful smell of \u2014 my dirty laundry in the hamper! I would be embarrassed to admit this, except for the miraculous fact that I had never noticed it until then. I have had a bad sense of smell as long as I can remember. This was unbelievable! It caused me to buy a covered hamper later that week. Six months later, my sense of smell has remained heightened. About a month after my treatment, I felt sensations like pinpricks on several places up and down my leg, on and off for several days, and then they went away. I had experienced leg pain in years past, when I used to walk to work every day, so I wonder if there was some latent healing going on there. Six months after treatment, I still have not experienced neck pain \u2014 which is extraordinary! There have been times when my neck feels a little stiff, like it wants to go out of alignment and become sore, but it just can't go there any more. I have decided to pursue occasional massage therapy and chiropractic care, to make sure I stay limber and to release physical stress from building up. The best thing I can report has happened recently, which is about six months after my treatment. I felt some tightness and discomfort in my groin area. This went on and off for a few days and I was starting to wonder what was happening. This sensation was familiar; I had a hysterectomy in 2005 and it felt just like this in the months after the surgery, when it was...healing!!! I am elated to realize that this is likely my body's way of finishing the healing from the radical procedure that I had six years prior. So, we don't know why everyone's atlas bone is misaligned. I guess I don't care. I am amazed at the grace that was bestowed upon Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcmperli that allowed him to come up with this idea in the first place. I invite others to research the websites, contact Dr. Koliner with questions, and come to a decision for themselves.\"I think I'm essentially too healthy to notice anything. But I'm sure I'll appreciate the difference when I'm 80 years old!\" - Craig Harvey \"Of any medical procedure or treatment I've had in my life, this is the most positive experience I've ever had! I had such incredible results. I'm so thrilled.\" - Laura WalinskyRob checked the lengths of my arms and legs again and pronounced them to be balanced. The range of motion in my neck was much better and I had no pain at all on the right side any more! - Amy GarberThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 46 Everyone who's ever been checked by Ren\u00e9 Sch\u00fcmperli or by anyone trained in the AtlasPROfilax procedure has been found to have their atlas dislocated. Except: Children whose mothers had their atlas fixed before pregnancy appear to be born with their atlas already in place! Why do most people, even those who were born via c-section, have a dislocated atlas bone? Rob knows no medical explanation for this, and geneticists would say that it's impossible. \"I would think that it's more energetic. But I don't know.\" Some hold the theory that the human race was cursed with this dislocation, either akin to the \"fall from grace\" out of Eden, or possibly perpetrated by aliens (related to the theory of our DNA being incomplete or tampered with). These theorists believe that now, with the atlas correction, we have rediscovered our full energetic potential, part of the foretold evolution of human consciousness. The way Rob explains it to patients is, \"Our body is twisted up before birth and the AtlasPROfilax treatment starts unwinding that.\" Rob's take on the theories of the punishment of the human race is: \"There's no way I can prove it's true, and no way I can prove it's not true, so I just stopped worrying about it.\" ~~~~~~ The fee for the one-time AtlasPROfilax treatment is $250 for adults, $175 for kids 15 years old and under. The cost includes the treatment visit and a re-check visit, along with any adjustments that may be needed during either appointment. Insurance doesn't cover the atlas treatment, because it is not chiropractic work. There is a lifetime guarantee that if the atlas ever goes out, Rob will redo the treatment at no charge. But this is unlikely to happen. The treatment visit starts with a detailed explanation of about 20 minutes plus Q&A, a review of the patient's medical history, and a physical evaluation of the patient's atlas, spine, legs, arms, and range of motion in the neck. The treatment itself takes about 20 or 30 seconds, as Rob uses the special tool to move the atlas behind the little styloid process bone. Is it painful? \"Some people find it very uncomfortable, some mildly uncomfortable, and some don't think it's that bad,\" Rob says. Immediately afterward, Rob re-checks the atlas, spine, legs, arms, and range of motion in the neck. For example, most people's legs are not the same length when they come in, but right after the treatment, they are balanced! Then Rob asks his patients to schedule the follow-up visit at least two weeks after the treatment. This is so he can make sure the atlas is in place, to get their feedback, hear their story, and further assist \"the unwinding process\" if needed. Rob also educates his patients to understand that having the AtlasPROfilax treatment does not mean they will never need chiropractic care again. \"If a person has no stress in their life, they would rarely need chiropractic care,\" Rob explains. \"Unfortunately, I don't know anyone that does not have some stress. The effects of stress distort the spine more than anything else.\" However, he finds the need for chiropractic definitely goes down after the AtlasPROfilax treatment. When new patients call, if they're not calling for the atlas treatment, Rob recommends they consider getting it first. \"Because,\" Rob says with his usual candor, \"all other treatments will work better, they'll need less chiropractic care, and it will save them a lot of money.\" Rob Koliner, D.C., AtlasPROf \u00ae, may be reached at From Within Health Center, located at the Center for Sacred Living, 210 Little Lake Drive #7, Ann Arbor, MI 48103, (734) 761-5908. For more information: Koliner's on the next page\"Is Your Head on Straight?\" Continued from 45 After her atlas treatment, a woman patient had pain for about a day and a half where her gallbladder was removed, and then it was gone. Another patient used to sprain his ankles a lot when he was much younger. After his atlas treatment, both his ankles got tender, sore, and stiff, and he had to walk gingerly for two days until the tenderness went away. ~~~~~~ One of the most dramatic changes Rob told me about was an 11-year-old girl who had been diagnosed with scoliosis and had been referred to Rob for chiropractic care. Her mother brought the x-rays of her spine, which showed the severe curvature. Rob suggested he correct the girl's atlas before doing chiropractic work, because it might allow her body to resolve the scoliosis on its own within several weeks. The girl's mother told Rob that the orthopedist had scheduled a second x-ray to be taken, and the appointment was actually the following day. Rob told her that he didn't know how much difference they would see in one day, but to call him if they saw good changes. The girl's mother did indeed call Rob the next day, very excited because the orthopedic surgeon had noted a dramatic change on the new x-ray! (See the before-and-after photos of the x-rays.) In the \"after\" x-ray, the curve at the top of the spine is barely visible, and it changed from a 20-degree curve to a 4-degree curve (a 16-degree change). Their doctor reportedly said, \"That's impossible,\" crossed it out, and wrote \"5 degrees.\" On the bottom, the spine curvature changed from 27 to 24 degrees (a 3-degree change). \"This,\" Rob showed me on the x-ray, pointing to the bottom part of the curvature with the 3-degree change, \"is a really big change. And this,\" he said, pointing to the top part, \"is unbelievable!\" In addition, upon re-check two weeks later, Rob was unable to feel any curvature in the girl's spine! ~~~~~~ So here's the weird part: Your head is most certainly not on straight, and most likely neither is anyone else's. Before After The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 48 By Helen Weingarten Why are you so afraid of silence, silence is the root of everything. If you spiral into its void, a hundred voices will thunder messages you long to hear. - Rumi, \"Hidden Music\" See how nature \u2014 trees, flowers, grass \u2014 grows in silence; see the stars, the moon and the sun, how they move in silence... We need silence to be able to touch souls. - Mother Teresa This is a love story about how falling in love with a very good dog allowed me to open my heart to a very good man. My husband is a quiet man. And for someone who is energized by conversation and who clarifies what she is thinking by talking about it, as I do, I always thought I needed to find a mate who loved to talk as much as I did. Yet, fortunately, one of the most important lessons living with a dog teaches is how rich silence can be, how silence can allow us to discover things that are hidden when everything is filled with words. Artists seem always to have known this, and we who have opened our hearts to animals discover this as well. If we allow it, silence strips us bare and opens us up. When you live with a dog you become aware of how much can be shared, and perhaps only shared, when talking ceases, in the absence of noise. I can still see my 85-year-old father in his bed, holding my six-month-old puppy in his arms, whispering in wonder \"so much life, so much life\" \u2014 a silent being bringing joy into a hospital room through her ability to just be, through her capacity to accept things just as they are. Desiree is my first animal companion. Before her, while some of the people I lived with had dogs, I never had a dog in my life and certainly had never yearned for one. Yet, all of a sudden, at the age of 53, living on my own after two marriages and a string of disappointing relationships, the thought \"I want to get a dog\" sprouted in my mind and couldn't be uprooted. Most of my friends cautioned against it. \"A dog is a lot of work; do you really want to walk them and clean up their messes \u2014 in Michigan, in the winter?\" \"You don't like being with anyone on a daily basis, how do you know you'll be able to live with a dog, 24/7?\" \"You travel a lot.\" \"Won't a dog tie you down?\" And, finally, \"Why don't you get a cat?\" I had considered a cat when the voice saying \"dog, dog, dog\" entered my brain. I have friends who adore their cats, and I knew they demanded less attention from their owners than dogs. But I suspected I was too neurotic to enjoy a cat. I'd want to hold him on my lap. He'd want to stalk and catch songbirds. I worried I would take the notorious independence of my hypothetical cat personally and feel rejected. No, a cat was not on the menu. But similar worries emerged as I thought about bringing a dog into my life. How do you house train a dog or teach her to catch a Frisbee? What if I bring home the one dog on the planet that won't regard her human with unconditional love? How do our decisions get made? I know that some people make lists with the plusses in one column and the minuses in the next, but for others, like myself, there are different ways of navigating through life. At 43, I traveled solo around the world because a travel agent mentioned in passing that buying an around the world ticket was about the same price as getting a round trip ticket to Israel, where I had been invited to teach during my sabbatical year. And at 53, I decided I wanted a dog after visiting a friend in California who lived with a wolf-shepherd mix and a short haired Chihuahua and was intrigued by 5-pound Maya leading the way with 70-pound Charlie trotting amiably along behind her. The great comic actor Charlie Chaplin is reported to have said, \"Why are you looking for meaning? Life is a desire, not a meaning.\" Yet, because desire is such an illusive thing, and the desire for a dog was so new to me and so outstripped my knowledge of what living with one would entail, I decided to wait and see if my desire was deep rooted or a passing fancy. I thought if I still wanted a dog after six months had elapsed, then I had to take the desire seriously and turn it into reality. Patience does not come easily to many, I among them; so, even before I invited a dog into my life, she was teaching the value of waiting, of being open to what comes next. And, although I was an academic who had tired of doing academic research, the possibility of getting a dog reawakened pleasure in discovering the existing wisdom on a subject and finding out how it might apply to my own interests. And there was a voluminous store of knowledge to draw from. According to the experts, prospective dog owners have to evaluate their lifestyle to figure out what kind of dog is best suited to their circumstances. Their advice is fairly obvious and straightforward. If you are neat, look for a dog that doesn't shed. If you are athletic and want a dog to jog with you, a Pekinese is likely to be a very poor choice. This is not new knowledge. In China, small dogs had been bred for centuries. In the 19 th century, the Empress Dowager created the Pekinese to sit on her feet and keep her warm in Beijing's cold winter months. \"Under the table dogs\" were bred and prized by scholars because, small enough to sit under their low writing desks, these dogs could keep their masters company as they did their work. Because I lived alone and travelled so much for my work, and because I, too, was a scholar of sorts, I concluded that I wanted a dog that could join me in my travels and stay with me in the main cabin, not in the cargo hold. A small dog made as much lifestyle sense for me as it had for the Dowager Empress \u2014 and thankfully I didn't have to start from scratch. In California, meeting a Chihuahua had started me on a journey, and even before I consciously desired a dog, I had fallen in love with the breed. A Chihuahua it was going to be. Still, six months later, when I brought a three-month-old, longhaired Chihuahua home and named her Desiree, I naively thought she was merely an addition to my life rather than a game changer. I quickly realized, however, that inviting a dog into my life not only changed my living arrangements \u2014 it changed me, as well. As any dog lover can tell you, dogs are not good conversationalists but they are excellent communicators. If you live with a dog and pay attention to what they are up to, small shifts in posture and gaze become infused with meaning. A tilt of a head in one direction told me that Desi was ready to play, while a tilt in another said, \"Pick me up, I want to be petted.\" She was a constant reminder that while the big picture is important, love often is found and enacted in the smallest of details. I know that some people believe that things happen because they are meant to happen, that events have intrinsic meaning rather than gaining meaning by how we respond to them, and perhaps this is true. But whether or not this is the case, we also have a choice in how we relate to the events that confront our lives. An off-the-cuff comment by a travel agent was heard as an invitation to embark on a worldwide journey. And years later, content to be single and living just with Desiree, a psychic temping at a local business said out of the blue that she wanted to give me free advice about my love life \u2014 and out of curiosity, I listened. Despite my insistence that I wasn't looking for a man and giving as evidence the fact that I had traded in my queen sized bed for a double, she was persistent. \"Go outside on a night with a full moon,\" she advised, \"prepare a list of everything you would like to find in a man, and offer it up to the heavens.\" And so, along with general attributes such as integrity, warmth, kindness, and generosity, I added specifics like \"I want him to be funny like the Car Talk guys\" and \"I want him to be creative like my photographer friend, John.\" Then, at the time of the full moon, somewhat embarrassed, I took the list outside, said a brief prayer, threw it on a small campfire, and watched as its smoke rose into the sky. It would be an understatement to say that I was surprised by love when months later, having once again backed my car into an immoveable object, I brought my car into a collision repair shop in a neighboring town. There I met Bill, the owner of the shop, who, along with making me laugh as we bantered about my car problems, has the walls of his waiting room covered with his own wonderful photographs. I was about to leave for California, and my plan, at that time, was to have a friend drive me to the airport. I'd bring my car into the shop when I returned. Instead, Bill logically suggested: \"Why don't you leave the car with me and I'll have it ready when you return.\" But then he added, \"I'll drive you to the airport.\"The desire that morphed into loving Desiree opened my heart and transformed me into a person capable of loving a man who was different from the men I had previously loved. Bill is a Midwesterner. He is quiet, down-to-earth, and self-reliant. He does great work with his hands as well as his head, and while he enjoys irony, he never uses sarcasm to make a point. Also, it didn't hurt that Desiree, who is quite picky about the people she deigns to relate to, was wild about Bill from the moment she met him.All creatures great and small Even before I invited a dog into my life, she was teaching the value of waiting, of being open to what comes next. She was a constant reminder that while the big picture is important, love often is found and enacted in the smallest of details.One of the most important lessons living with a dog teaches is how rich silence can be. Surprised by Love A Love Story about How Falling in Love with a Very Good Dog Allowed Me to Open My Heart to a Very Good Man Helen Weingarten, her husband, Bill, and Desiree The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 49 I do not believe that teachers only pop up on rare occasions. I believe they are there all the time, in human form, in nature, and as our companions, both human and animal. Yet, we recognize their presence only when we are open to seeing them, and this mostly happens in times of quiet reflection. Socrates famously advised, \"Know thyself.\" In my own life this has meant knowing myself to be part of a complex web of relationships, that we love who we love, and who this turns out to be may surprise us.

The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 50 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 51 Interview by Sandor Slomovits Paul Tinkerhess, along with his wife, Claire, owns the Birkenstock shoe store and the adjacent TempurPedic mattress store on Fourth Avenue. Tinkerhess, 54, has lived in Ann Arbor since the mid eighties and is the founder and driving force behind the Water Hill Music Festival, a unique event that debuted last May, but promises to become an annual treasured Ann Arbor institution. Tinkerhess' family was involved in a landmark Supreme Court free speech decision in the 1960s, and he has carried on his family heritage through his music, his participation in the local Quaker community, and even in his attitudes about his business. I talked with Paul last December, and again in January, in the small living room of his home in the Water Hill neighborhood of the Old West Side. In December, a teal colored gas stove warmed the room and, along with a Christmas tree, cast a cheery glow. Tinkerhess is soft-spoken and, perhaps due to his extensive stage experience as a musician, or maybe because he's a natural storyteller, he shares his thoughts and reflections on a wide range of topics in a very deliberate, clear, often colorful and humorous, and always thoughtful manner. Sandor Slomovits: Let's start with your childhood. Paul Tinkerhess: I was raised in a busy house. My parents were very concerned socially and politically. I had five older brothers and sisters and we generally supported our parents in their efforts to make a better world. Sandor Slomovits: What did your parents do? Paul Tinkerhess: My dad was a Methodist minister and my mother was a psychologist and a teacher of social work. My dad eventually got frustrated with the lack of support he was receiving in his efforts to speak out on issues of civil rights and peace. So, in the mid 1960s, he found the Quakers, and particularly the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), and took a job with the AFSC as Peace Education Secretary in Des Moines, Iowa. He received a special appointment from his bishop to do that work. He remained a Methodist minister, but, for all intents and purposes, we became Quakers at that point. Sandor: How old were you?Paul Tinkerhess: I was just about to enter kindergarten. Some of my earliest childhood memories are of being on picket lines around the federal building in Des Moines. I was literally on picket lines in a stroller, and I loved the singing. (Paul starts humming, \"Come on over to the swimming pool, I'll be swimming right there...\") We sang \"We Shall Overcome\" and all those great old songs. There was our family, with eight members, and another family that I believe also had six children, and sometimes we were maybe all, or most, of the picket line around the federal building in the early protests against the Vietnam War. I came to understand early on that our family was a little different than most of the other people in our community, at least in regard to our outlook on politics, and peace especially. But I remember that that was a good feeling, knowing that there was a small group of people that were bound up together in a cause that felt right. Around this same time there were other little protests bubbling up around the country against the Vietnam War and my older brothers and sisters heard about a protest somewhere where people were wearing black armbands as a symbol of mourning the dead in Vietnam. At some meeting the idea was put forward that maybe we should pick a particular day to wear black armbands to school. It wound up focusing on a truce that Bobby Kennedy had proposed for Christmas, 1965. The idea came forward that we would wear these armbands to school in support of this truce, and to suggest that the truce should be continued beyond just Christmas time. I do remember that morning, heading off to school, wearing a black armband, and I couldn't have explained all the issues, the history of Vietnam... Sandor: You were in second grade? Paul Tinkerhess: Yes. But, I did feel confident to my core about what we were doing. Some things are simple enough really that a child can completely understand them. We knew that our country was responsible for raining death and destruction on innocent people in Vietnam. It seemed like the right thing to protest that. I remember going to school and having kids ask, \"What's that for?\" and explaining to them that it was a symbol of our sadness about the deaths happening in Vietnam. I think all of us made a point to say that we were protesting deaths on both sides. The interesting thing about this case was that sometime before we wore the armbands, the school board in Des Moines caught wind of this plan and even before we had a chance to wear the armbands, they called a special meeting where they banned the wearing of black armbands. (Laughter) Sandor: A pre-emptive strike! Paul Tinkerhess: Yes. They thought it was a pre-emptive strike. Now, of course, we see it as they basically pulled back the spring on their own mousetrap. Now that I've read Gandhi and non-violent strategy, I see that these actions are only successful if they can capture the attention of the powerful forces and they react in a way that, as Gandhi said, forces the wolf to remove its sheep's clothing. So we did wear the armbands. I was not bothered by my teachers or fellow students, but my older sister, Mary Beth, was suspended that day for wearing the armband and told that she couldn't return to school if she didn't take the armband off. Sandor: She was in high school?Paul Tinkerhess: She was 13, in junior high. My brother, John, who was 15, had faith that he could speak reason to the members of the board, and so he had put in some phone calls to them in hopes that he could convince them to change their policy. And since he hadn't finished his conversations with them by that day, he didn't wear his armband that first day. But since my sister was suspended, he wore his armband the next day and was suspended. We were contacted by the American Civil Liberties Union and they offered to help us take this case to court. The case went to court and at the first level the judge decided against us. He cited that schools have to have a certain level of order to protect the rights of students to get their education, and understanding that school authorities need to have a certain amount of power over students to maintain control. It's maybe a little hard, especially for young people today, to understand the environment that this was happening in America in 1965. Traditionally, when we get into a war, the reaction is to circle the wagons. You don't speak up against the war, and if you do, people misinterpret that to believe that you're actually in support of the enemy and against your own country. We certainly felt a lot of that from our neighbors and our fellow countrymen. We received a lot of hateful mail and phone calls. I remember one person called up and said they were going to kill my sister Mary Beth on the way to school the next morning. One radio talk show host in Des Moines offered to provide the weapon to the person who would kill my father. My parents had told us about a large closet in our basement that would be a good place for us to hide if someone came to the door with hostile intent and they weren't home. So this all contributed to the feeling that we were doing something different than what other people believed in, but that this was important work, because if we weren't doing it, then nobody else was going to do it. Anyway, we lost the case at the first level and it was appealed, and at the appellate court they normally have an odd number of judges so they don't have a tie, but for some reason they were missing one judge on the bench that season, and they did tie, which upholds the ruling of the lower court. So we were still losers. There was only one more court to appeal it to at that point, the U.S. Supreme Court, which doesn't accept many of the cases brought to it, as many losers come to them. (Laughter) But they did accept our case, which was a very exciting breakthrough. Of course, all this took years. In November 1968, finally, we all went to the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case tried. I remember walking up the broad steps of the building and seeing the beautiful sculptures of blind justice and being impressed with the architecture there. And then, months later, I remember being called out of class by my teacher to say that my mother had called and that there was something about our court case, and that I should go home. When I got there, there were wire service reporters. The Court had announced that Abe Fortas, writing for the majority, said, \"It can hardly be argued that students or teachers shed their Constitutional rights at the schoolhouse gate.\" It remains one of the most important student rights cases in the country, and some people say, one of the most important free speech cases. There is some beautiful language in that opinion about the kind of experimental freedom that we enjoy in this country, and that it is protected, as the Court saw it. He said that this is a risky kind of democracy, that the protections of free speech are not designed to protect popular speech. That has it's own natural protection. But this is particularly to protect speech that might cause controversy, like what we were doing.

I was literally on picket lines in a stroller, and I loved the singing. I remember going to school and having kids ask, \"What's that for?\" and explaining to them that it was a symbol of our sadness about the deaths happening in Vietnam.

Continued on page 53The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 52 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 53 So, we set out, like we had so many times, to just do some small action that might contribute in some small way for peace, and we almost accidentally wound up contributing toward protecting free speech, maybe even in some ways enlarging the protections for free speech. That was pretty exciting because, as a lot of activists will appreciate, you do so many things where you feel like you're knocking on a door that never seems to open, and now I feel like, if you're lucky, occasionally you might see that door open a crack. Not that all these other actions aren't equally valuable, but just occasionally maybe you feel like you win one. (Laughter) I'm very proud to be associated with that case (Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, 1969). Sandor: Did you know, the way some people seem to know relatively early on in life, that this \u2014 whatever this is \u2014 is what I want to do? Paul Tinkerhess: I think from an early age I knew that I wanted to...I didn't know this phrase at that time but now I'd say that I want to \"cast my lot.\" That's from Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed, from the song \"Guantanamera.\" I had the feeling that I wanted to cast my lot with the forces of justice and peace. And I don't know how successful I've been doing that. I think I do that in a very small way. I think I have a humbler view of how much each one of us can do. I feel in some ways we're all strapped to a conveyor belt of culture and that it's our responsibility to respond to issues as we feel them weighing on our shoulders. Sandor: So what was next? Paul Tinkerhess: I'd taken up a hobby of making leather belts in high school. My brothers had been making leather crafts in the 60's, and there were some emblematic accessories that some people wore then, including leather fringed pouches that you ran your belt through. We made those kinds of things and put leather peace symbols on them. I took up making leather belts, which I called Tinker Belts. (Laughter) (At the time my name was Tinker, later Claire and I combined our names.) I sold those to my friends. I went to Earlham College; it's a Quaker school in Richmond, Indiana. When I started school I think I thought I might become a lawyer. I took philosophy classes with that in mind. But I didn't really know what I might do, of course, and my dad came down with cancer during my college years and at one point I took a leave of absence to be with him, while he was dying, as it turned out. Being with anyone while they're dying can have a transformative effect on a young person, and his death certainly did on me. Not all in a bad way, but it brought me to the realization that there are some profound truths about our existence that are not often talked about, but that are very true. And that set other things in their place when placed next to them. I say there must not be money made off of these things, because you don't get interrupted during your favorite TV shows every twelve minutes with someone saying, \"Don't forget, you're gonna die!\" (Laughter) Even though it seems so important to keep in mind. At Earlham I met Claire Hess and fell in love. We heard about a college on the West Coast called Evergreen State College where study was not divided into separate subjects, but you would take one program that integrated various subjects together. That seemed like a much better way to learn. So, Claire went out to Evergreen, and when my father died, I followed her to Olympia, Washington. I did like having that experience at Earlham and I did like leaving Earlham and finishing at Evergreen. Claire and I still were interested in peace work and at that time there was a lot of energy focused on nuclear power and nuclear weapons. So, after college, we took up a job where we were placed, through the Methodist Church, in East Lansing, and worked doing peace organizing through a campus ministry there. Sandor: When was this?Paul Tinkerhess: We were married in '82 and soon after that we drove our '66 VW Squareback across the country, loaded with everything we owned, to East Lansing. We worked there for three years and then the world was wide open to us, and we were casting about for possibilities and thought we kind of liked the idea of living in one of these cities where there is already a critical mass of like minded people that are really fleshing out their vision of a better world. While we were in East Lansing I had volunteered to be on an AFS Peace Education Committee that met monthly in Ann Arbor. And I developed a feeling as I drove into Ann Arbor that this was a special place. Couldn't put my thumb on it, but...you come into Ann Arbor, it kind of looks nice, you think people are actually designing this place, thinking about its aesthetics, and you get to know people here and you feel like there are a lot of people in Ann Arbor who are really trying to pursue their dreams. It's not all peace activists of course, but I liked the feeling that in Ann Arbor there were a lot of people who were trying to do whatever they do, well. And there happened to be a job opening at the Quaker House, run by the Ann Arbor Friends Meeting. So we moved to Ann Arbor. While we were in East Lansing, I had returned to a hobby of mine from high school of flying kites. Once we got the job in campus ministry, I discovered that for the first time I had enough money to buy all the string I wanted. (Laughter) So, I could fly my kite as high as I could. My older brothers had taught me how to make kite string winders to retrieve a kite after you'd flown it out a long distance, instead of just having to wrap it around a stick. They taught me to feed two dowels through two wooden rails, so the dowels catch the string and also serve as handles that you could wrap around and around. While we were in East Lansing, I got fixated on building a better kite string winder. I set up a little woodworking shop in our basement, came up with a design that I felt pretty good about finally, and took it to a kite store in East Lansing and they started selling them. It was right about that time that we moved to Ann Arbor. When we came here, I set up a woodworking shop in a friend's garage and started sending out my kite string winders to stores around the country, because the job at Quaker House was just part time. Claire took on a part time job working in a shoe store. As time went on, we got pregnant with our first child, our oldest son, Miller, and I realized I had to do a better job of providing, and I became the manager of the shoe store where Claire had been working. Sandor: A Birkenstock store?Paul Tinkerhess: Yes. Claire had bought a pair of Birkenstocks when we were out in Olympia. And she kept bringing them out for service every summer, year after year. They were similar in design and function to the belts that I was making. While we were living in Olympia, the way I made money was I continued making leather belts. I took the early morning Greyhound bus up to Seattle and sold my leather belts at the Pike Place Farmers' Market. On a good day I would sell a belt! (Laughter) And I would pay for the Greyhound bus ticket. (More laughter) There were not a lot of shoe stores that carried Birkenstocks then. People that wanted Birkenstocks would often find them in a health food store, and that's where Claire found hers. And since she had fit herself, they were actually a little bit too large for her, but that made them just a little bit too small for me, and so we both wore them interchangeably. It was one of these products where you were pleasantly surprised that it kept working year after year. And, of course, with our rebellious spirits, part of the appeal of Birkenstocks was that they were very different from what normal shoes looked like at that time, and that they functioned in a way that was superior to the way other shoes were at that time. Soon after I started managing the store that carried Birkenstocks it was put up for sale. I had a fantasy of buying that store, because I didn't really just want to be somebody's manager my whole career. So I started talking with everybody I knew whom I thought might have some money, and I couldn't convince the people I knew to loan me enough money to buy that store. Meanwhile, Claire and I had noticed that there was a storefront across the street from the Fourth Avenue Food Co-op that was for rent. We started thinking of different businesses that we might put into that space. I'd worked with wood and had several little wooden toys that I was making at that time, and we thought we could open a toy store there, or maybe I could pursue making wooden furniture, or we could have a cotton clothing store. I remember talking with a friend of mine who knew a lot about retail, and he said, \"You know what would really go well into that space, in that neighborhood, is a Birkenstock store.\" And I said, \"Yeah, but there is already a Birkenstock store in town.\" And he said, \"You know, a lot of distributors are happy to have more than one store distributing their product in a town. It kind of keeps everybody on their toes and gets more people in that town using their product.\" So, I contacted Birkenstock and, in a somewhat risky move, I opened a second Birkenstock store in Ann Arbor. Sandor: When was that? Paul Tinkerhess: That would have been in June of 1989. It was only a few months before we opened the store that I contacted Birkenstock to inquire whether this might be a possibility. We managed to throw that store together in a hurry so that we could open for that summer's season. And we thought maybe I would be able to open a repair service. We knew that Birkenstocks were repairable and that nobody around here was doing that, and I'd already been working with my hands quite a lot. At that time we had a vision that maybe we'd be able to stock all the Birkenstocks that were being made in all the sizes. As it's turned out over the years, Birkenstock has increased the number of styles and colors and patterns that they offer just about every year, so we've never been able to stock all the different styles, and we've also found the benefit of adding other brands to our collection, partly because we are, after all, in Michigan and have a temperate climate. Then, about fifteen years ago, we were in Indianapolis and came across a store that was selling a mattress that we'd never seen before and Claire said, \"Hey Paul, you better lay down on that mattress.\" And I did, and about the first thing I said was, \"This feels like a Birkenstock for my whole body.\" So we called that company to see if they might set up an account selling their mattress in a shoe store. It seemed a little silly, but to us it seemed like a similar kind of product. We're providing contoured support for the human skeleton. They agreed, so we added a mattress to our shoe store and later, when the barbershop that had been next to the shoe store went out of business, we took over that space and expanded it into a mattress store. We're waiting to be proven wrong, but we think we may have the only shoe/mattress store in the world. (Laughter) Our commitment at Quaker House was only for a couple of years, and we'd bought a small house on the west side of town. A very small house, about 1100 square feet, no basement, no garage, and one thing led to another and we found ourselves with three children in this very small house. So we were looking around for a larger Paul Tinkerhess Opens Up About His Activist Youth, Founding Fourth Ave Birkenstock, and His Vision for the Water Hill Music Festival Photos by Rachael WaringClaire said, \"Hey Paul, you better lay down on that mattress.\" And I did, and about the first thing I said was, \"This feels like a Birkenstock for my whole body.\" - Paul Tinkerhess on how he and his wife got the idea to sell mattresses at their shoe store We're waiting to be proven wrong, but we think we may have the only shoe/mattress store in the world. (Laughter)I remember once my father came to visit me while I was still at Earlham and he was concerned that I hadn't picked a career path, and I remember saying to him, \"Dad, you've never been very supportive of my interest in music.\" And he said, \"Well, son, I guess you and I just grew up on different sides of the Depression.\"I got to spend three months studying with Odetta...It turned out that in that class we didn't actually talk much about the practicalities of making music. It was more about just trying to absorb the aura of Odetta. And there was a lot of aura to absorb. She was beautiful.Continued from page 51 Continued on page 56We've operated with the attitude that it was our job to respect our kids and support them and to listen to what directions they might want to go in, and then blow wind in their sails.Even though my line of work is about the definition of mundane, selling shoes, I like to humor myself by thinking that it's a somewhat meaningful line of work; that your feet are, after all, your point of contact with Mother Earth.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 55 Water Hill Photo by Mark Evans Marcus Belgrave on his front porch Water Hill Photo by Steve ScheweThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 54 Scenes from the first Water Hill Music Festival Water Hill Photo by Steve ScheweWater Hill Photo by Mark Evans Water Hill Photo by Monte Fowler John Madison and Friends Water Hill Photo by Steve Schewe The Chenille Sisters played to a happy and lively crowd Water Hill Photo by Steve Schewe David Keeney and Chris Buhalis kick off last year's festival at the home of Chris BuhalisEveryone on Water Hill who either is a musician or wants to pretend to be a musician is encouraged to step out onto their front porch and play music on the afternoon of the first Sunday in May.

I only sent out my first email in early March, but eventually we had over two hundred people performing music on sixty different porches around the neighborhood, and anybody who was able to attend that will testify that it was quite a remarkable afternoon. There was really something very special in the air. Among other things, the weather cooperated. Sandor: I remember.Paul Tinkerhess: It had been a cold, misty morning. It broke at just about exactly two o'clock into a beautiful, blue, sunny day. I was up really late the night before, printing the final program for people to know where to wander from porch to porch. Somehow we came up with the idea of identifying the various places that people would be performing with yard signs. It was too expensive to have the yard signs printed, but I was able to buy blank yard signs and Claire and I made some crude stencils to paint the logo that we had made for us by Kate Uleman, a graphic designer who lives in the neighborhood. (She cleverly incorporated a baluster from a porch into the neck of a nice guitar.) So we stenciled those guitars onto the yard signs, and then Claire hand lettered each of the signs with the name of the band and when they would be performing. Claire and I had a lot of fun a few days before the actual event, going around the neighborhood and planting these signs in people's front yards. And then, shortly afterward, observing people wandering the neighborhood, making notes about who was going to be performing when. One of the early enthusiastic responders to my email was Vienna Teng. Claire and I had heard that she had moved to Ann Arbor to pursue a master's degree, and we learned that she was living in this neighborhood. So, I sent her an email with the first batch. And she was one of the first and most enthusiastic respondents, saying, \"I think this is a great idea, however on the first of May I'll be touring in California. Could you possibly move it to another day?\" And we certainly considered doing that, but then it started overlapping with Easter and we decided we had to keep it on May 1, but I asked Vienna if she'd be willing to consider putting on a special concert for just a limited group of invited guests \u2014 the first fifty people to sign up to perform on their porches. This would serve as incentive for people to sign up and might be a neat community-building event before the actual festival. To my delight, she very generously agreed to do that. We were able to host that event in what was the Fountain Church of God that is now owned by Carl Rinne and Tamara Real, who let the sanctuary space be used from time to time for community events. So Vienna Teng did this unforgettable concert one glorious night, with all these people who'd volunteered to perform, mostly walking from their houses, streaming in there, to that church. It really helped to set a beautiful introduction to this festival. On the day of the festival somewhere around four or five thousand people filled the neighborhood. I don't think any of us had ever been to an event like this. It was all very fresh and it was all very wonderful. Part of the charm was that we had, along with many professional musicians who live in the neighborhood, who were giving these great free concerts on their porches, right next door there would be a school child with a clarinet and their friend with a violin or something. And they were all on an equal footing, equal billing, and you really got a sense of the neighborhood itself performing, all of these people kind of combined into one kind of new personality that nobody had ever seen before. Of course, music itself is an act of faith in putting your heart on your sleeve, but here, that feeling of putting out a personal message was, I think, amplified because people were doing this on their own front porches, on the patch of earth that was most meaningful to them. Especially in the modern day, I think we've come to act in a way that our own place of residence is kept hidden. We lead our public lives out in the world, but we don't often let people know where we live. Since that festival, I've tried to think about it and figure out what made it so special, partly in the hope that we might be able to distill those elements to continue that special feeling in future events, and I do believe that part of it is something you cannot do except by having people perform at their own homes. I think as people wandered from place to place knowing that, it just maybe struck a chord somewhere in our DNA, where for hundreds of thousands of years the people we've known, we've known where they lived. I don't know what it was and maybe we don't ever have to know exactly what it was that made it so special. Sandor: But you're doing it again.Paul Tinkerhess: We're doing it again. I think whether I said yes or no, this thing would happen again, just on its own momentum. It's a living being at this point. Sandor: You told me a few days after the festival that you'd gotten an email from someone who had ideas about how to commercialize the festival. Paul Tinkerhess: I suspect that another part of what made this event special was that we did deliberately resist sponsorship and having this be in any way commercial. You know, you look around at so many things in our culture, and you ask yourself, \"Why is that thing happening?\" It's not just that somebody put up the money to make it happen, but they usually get their logo emblazoned somewhere on it. I'm not sure there is anything really wrong with that, I'm a businessperson and I appreciate that businesses need to do what they can to have a good image out in the world. And certainly when businesses contribute to good causes, maybe they are making the world a better place. I don't want to discourage that, but I do want to highlight that if we can make things happen from time to time that don't involve commercialization, I think we're on a more direct path toward something very deep and meaningful, not only inside ourselves, but something that maybe can bind us to one another. On the day of our festival there were three ways you could spend money. You could buy the T-shirts that we had made and sold in front of our house to try to recoup some of the expenses that we put out. You could buy the half priced homemade Ding Dongs that they were selling in celebration of the event down at Big City Bakery. Or you could attend the Democratic Party fundraiser at the Elks Lodge, which I had promoted through our website, waterhill.org, saying either that they [people] would want to attend that fundraiser to support the Democratic Party, or if they were Republicans, they might want to attend and eat more than their ten dollars worth. (Laughter) We enjoyed later seeing that the mayor, who attended the event, along with a lot of City Council members, was quoted as saying that he thought it was a great event and the city might contribute to future events by arranging for more Porta Potties. (Because we only had one Porta Potty available at the festival.) And, as happy as we were with this suggestion, Claire let that idea tumble around in her mind and came up with something I think is really brilliant, which is that we need to try to meet our needs for this neighborhood festival in this neighborhood, and that this Porta Potty business is one example. Claire pointed out that in this neighborhood of hundreds of houses, we have hundreds and hundreds of toilets already, and wouldn't it be possible to ask, are there folks who would have a bathroom that's conveniently located off of some side door of their house that they would be willing to let people use; that we don't need to necessarily truck in more toilets. Sandor: What else have you been up to lately?Tinkerhess: Lately, my favorite cold weather activity, and one of my favorite activities in general, is running. I've become a runner; just since last summer. I've tried it on and off numerous times in my life, but I've had various aches and pains. But lately, there's kind of a reemergence of what I think is an old way of running. It's a way of running so you don't strike hard with your heels on the ground, you don't reach out in front of you, you leave your feet planting just under your hips, and it turns out that those arches in our feet that we focus on so much at the shoe store all the time, are capable of absorbing the shock, even on pavement. I've got a little 5K route that goes through Water Hill; down to Daniel, up the hill to the cemetery, over to the water treatment plant, down Pomona and around to Mixtwood, up the big hill on Brooks and back down on Bydding and Miner. I do that, or a similar three to five mile route, about every other day. We've just started carrying these new shoes down at the store; they're from Sweden, they're called Ice Bug, and they have little carbide studs in the bottom of their running shoes that grip just fine on slippery snow and ice. These running shoes are really neat because the little carbide studs are set into the sole in a way that if you land on clear pavement and you put your weight on it, they're designed to retract enough that the rubber elements engage. So they're grippy on any surface that you're running on. And that has really empowered me to keep running right through weather like this. On the day of the festival somewhere around four or five thousand people filled the neighborhood. I don't think any of us had ever been to an event like this. It was all very fresh and it was all very wonderful. Part of the charm was that we had, along with many professional musicians who live in the neighborhood, who were giving these great free concerts on their porches, right next door there would be a school child with a clarinet and their friend with a violin or something. And they were all on an equal footing, equal billing...I suspect that another part of what made this event special was that we did deliberately resist sponsorship and having this be in any way commercial.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 56 house in the neighborhood. We had just started this new business downtown, so we wanted the house to be within walking distance of the store, and we weren't able to find a house that we could afford, but we did find a vacant lot. We had asked a friend who was an architect to consider designing a small house that we could afford to build on this vacant lot. About that same time we heard rumors of a house downtown that was about to be torn down if nobody had a better purpose for it. We looked at it and it was covered with asbestos siding and it was all boarded up and it was frankly kind of ugly, but it was larger than any house we could afford to build and we kind of liked the idea of recycling this house, instead of having it torn down and thrown away. So we put together a proposal and a bid for that house and we won it for one dollar. Of course, it cost a lot more than that to move the house and to have it made into a livable space. Sandor: We're talking in that house now?Paul Tinkerhess: Yes, here on Miner Street. We call it the Miner Miracle. (Laughter) Moving a house is not something we recommend to people that we like, but it's one of those things, like many things in life, that if we had known what was involved we never would have done it, but we're glad we didn't know because we're glad we did it. But I don't think we'll do it again. (Laughter) Sandor: Let's talk about the Water Hill Festival. Paul Tinkerhess: When I was at Earlham, my brother gave me, or loaned me, what had been my grandparents' banjo. My clever brother, John, had learned the clawhammer frailing technique on the banjo, which is not intuitive. (Laughter) It's downright counter intuitive. He taught me how to do that by having me put my hand on top of his hand while he did it, which was a really beautifully effective way to learn the instrument. I took that banjo to Earlham, where my roommate, David Wilke, was a folk musician. David played \u2014 still plays \u2014 guitar and knew a lot of folk songs, and I knew a fair amount of folk songs and Civil Rights songs and peace songs. So we formed a duo and started playing in the Earlham coffeehouse and really enjoyed it. When I left the Midwest and moved out to the West Coast I took that banjo with me. At some point my brother John agreed that it was mine. (Laughter) I kept taking this music business more and more seriously. I decided while I was at Evergreen that I should focus on music. I remember once my father came to visit me while I was still at Earlham and he was concerned that I hadn't picked a career path, and I remember saying to him, \"Dad, you've never been very supportive of my interest in music.\" And he said, \"Well, son, I guess you and I just grew up on different sides of the Depression.\" And actually, that meant something to me, and I saw where he was coming from. However, it did not dampen my interest in music. (Laughter) It was at Evergreen that I really started to perform professionally, at coffeehouses, and also at any protest that they needed some anti-nuclear weapons songs, or anti-nuclear power songs. It was also while we were at Evergreen that I heard that Odetta was going to be a visiting artist, teaching there for a semester. I applied to be in her class and I was accepted, and so I got to spend three months studying with Odetta. When I was growing up I had worn out Odetta records, just listening to them over and over again. So studying with her I never got used to being in the same room with Odetta, because to me she was just...a part of my childhood. It turned out that in that class we didn't actually talk much about the practicalities of making music. It was more about just trying to absorb the aura of Odetta. And there was a lot of aura to absorb. She was beautiful. One of the best things I learned from Odetta came when we were having a conversation, just one on one, and I said to her, \"When I'm walking down the sidewalk and I say hi to someone who is walking toward me, and they don't say hi back, I have to feel badly about that.\" And she said in her operatic voice, (and here Paul smoothly slips into a very credible imitation of Odetta's measured pace and honeyed voice) \"Why should you feel badly? You did the right thing.\" And I came to appreciate that. Up until that time, I had bought into what I now call the \"conservation of misery principle\"; believing that there is only a limited amount of misery in the world, and if I take on some of it, it must surely be coming away from someone else. (Laughter) Sandor: You did study philosophy in college! (Laughter)Paul Tinkerhess: Thank you. But after that, I came to believe that sometimes when we take on misery, we're just making more misery in the world, and that I am not responsible for all of the history that has gone into whoever it is I'm dealing with at the moment. I will take responsibility for that one onion skin layer of experience that we're both creating in that moment, but I don't need to feel sorrow for what might have led them to whatever behaviors they've needed to take on because of their previous history. Odetta was great. Sandor: So, back to Water Hill.Paul Tinkerhess: When we came to Ann Arbor I thought of myself still as a folk musician. When we moved into this neighborhood, into our \"moved\" house, sometimes I would walk or bicycle with my children to school. Especially on a bicycle you become very aware of the contours of a piece of ground. I became aware of the shape of the hill we were living on, and I knew that unlike some other areas of Ann Arbor, this neighborhood did not have a name. I knew that the water treatment plant was up at the top of the hill and we had Spring Street, Fountain Street, and Brooks Street. Somebody said that, in what's now our backyard, there had been a stream running many years ago. I started to hum little songs to myself about the neighborhood. I never did write a song about it, but I did come up with the idea that maybe it could be named Water Hill. And I kind of tested it out inside my own mind for months and months, and then I started suggesting it to other people. I continued to try to spread that rumor that the neighborhood was called Water Hill. Anyway, years went by and another idea had started to develop in my mind, as I started coming to know a number of the musicians who live in this neighborhood. My friend Tom Princen, who is a professor in the School of Natural Resources, remembers that one night, maybe when we were talking about one of the blackouts that had happened, we got to brainstorming about how nice it was that people could still play music, even in a blackout. This vision started to crystallize of people playing music on their porches and maybe a lot of people on the same day. I'd been to Pete Seeger's Hudson River Revival Festival some years ago and that was the first time I'd been to a music festival that had more than one stage, with people wandering from one stage to the next. And I started wondering if that might work in a neighborhood with people playing on their porches. So I let this idea, along with a lot of others, just percolate in my mind. A lot of my ideas, when I actually air them, they turn out to be stupid ideas anyway, right? There's always that fear. And then something happened a couple of years ago. My beautiful sister, Bonnie, who was a wonderful woman, was killed in a bicycle accident. And, like the death of my father, these events are tragic and yet very true. And you know, anything that's very true can be helpful. Bonnies's death further underlined the brevity of our lives and it motivated me to maybe let a few of these crazy ideas out of the bag, while we still can. So, last spring, one morning I started looking at the calendar and I thought, if we're ever going to try to have a music festival like this and have it on an annual basis, it would be nice if it was the first something of something, like the first Saturday in April. I knew, having lived in Ann Arbor twenty some years, approximately when the nice weather starts kicking in, and that early May can be really nice. I noticed that in 2011 the first Sunday in May was May Day. So I thought that maybe this is a sign. I sent out some emails to musicians I knew in the neighborhood with this crazy idea, and I got some emails back pretty quickly saying I think this is not just a good idea, it's a great idea. So, after a few of them signed up saying yes, I was able to contact other musicians and say, \"Look, I've already got these several folks who've agreed to do it.\" And it began to snowball. I started to hum little songs to myself about the neighborhood. I never did write a song about it, but I did come up with the idea that maybe it could be named Water Hill. And I kind of tested it out inside my own mind for months and months, and then I started suggesting it to other people. I continued to try to spread that rumor that the neighborhood was called Water Hill.Paul Tinkerhess Opens Up About His Activist Youth, Founding Fourth Ave Birkenstock, and His Vision for the Water Hill Festival Continued from page 53 We got to brainstorming about how nice it was that people could still play music, even in a blackout. This vision started to crystallize of people playing music on their porches and maybe a lot of people on the same day. I only sent out my first email in early March, but eventually we had over two hundred people performing music on sixty different porches around the neighborhood, and anybody who was able to attend that will testify that it was quite a remarkable afternoon. There was really something very special in the air.Continued on page 58 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 58 I did not expect at this point in my life to become an athlete. But I've been running pretty consistently since July, and my calves are getting so fat I can just about not fit them into my jeans any more, (Laughter) and my heart is getting strong. I can run up Daniel now, I don't question whether I'll need to stop, and it's been great to be able do it with Claire, and my boys are also runners. Sandor: Let's talk about your family.Paul Tinkerhess: I still remember that feeling of driving out to the countryside on the day I learned that Claire was pregnant with our first child and, just that overwhelming, indescribable feeling of excitement, expectancy. Our little baby, Miller, was born in 1986 up on the third floor of Quaker House with Claire's parents both there, and the midwife. I think Claire has always had a good intuitive sense for raising kids. I'll take some credit for that too, but she spent more time with the kids when they were little than I did. Eventually we had two more boys, Martin and Eric; they were all born at home. We've operated with the attitude that it was our job to respect our kids and support them and to listen to what directions they might want to go in, and then blow wind in their sails. Sandor: That's a nice way of putting it. Paul Tinkerhess: It's worked out pretty well. I've kept up playing music all through my life, and so the kids would from time to time see me learning a song, playing the banjo with the words to a new song taped to the wall. Without really encouraging them much to play music, I think just by seeing me playing music, and Claire singing also, it was something they naturally wanted to explore. Miller took up the trumpet and became quite a trumpeter and graduated from Oberlin Music Conservatory in jazz trumpet. Martin liked the saxophone and he's quite a funk saxophone player, has played in several local bands in high school and continued in college. Eric took up the cello, and they all did this with the support of the Ann Arbor public schools. I've come to appreciate what a supportive environment Ann Arbor provides for people interested in music. I think it would have been fine if our kids had pursued other interests. We're particularly happy that they are musical and I love the rare times when we get to play music together. Sometimes people will ask us, \"How did you get your kids to be musicians?\" I think there are probably many different valid approaches to raising children, but in our case we took this approach: we never, ever told them to practice. We just felt that music was too sacred of a subject to be doing because of some external threat or reward, that if they wanted to take it up, then they should do that out of some internal motivation; that music, like so many forms of learning, is its own reward. So I tell parents who want to encourage their kids to take up music to think twice about telling them to practice. Instead, I encourage parents to take up the autoharp, to start playing music, because I believe more and more over the years in the power of our ingrained DNA learning styles. I think for millennia we've learned what the older people in our tribe did, just by looking over somebody's shoulder when we're young. If children are raised in a respectful environment, then I think they naturally want to do what the adults in that place are doing. If you want your children to grow up to be teachers, just put them in a room with a teacher at the head of the room. But if you want them to grow up learning something, put them in a room with somebody who is learning. Then they'll naturally start trying to learn that thing. I think in a lot of classrooms in Ann Arbor you get the best of both of that, that the teachers themselves are learners, and you can get that sense of entrusting your children to a teacher who continues to have curiosity all through their life. When Miller was lined up to go to graduate school in jazz trumpet, he decided at the last minute to pursue another of his passions, which is computer programming and making video games. We like to joke that, because he was the oldest child, we prohibited him from having video games when he was little, so he naturally wants to pursue this direction. We wonder what would have happened if we'd have prevented him from having, say, law school textbooks when he was little. (Laughter) But we're very glad that he's successfully pursuing his master's degree now in computer engineering at the UofM. Martin also decided not to pursue music for a career and instead graduated from college in biochemistry and is just in the process of applying to medical school and hopes to go to medical school in the fall. Very proud of him, too. Eric has stayed way out on the musical limb as a cellist and he's in his third year now at Oberlin Conservatory, and just finished a semester at the Paris Conservatory. He has his sights set on being a professional musician. I just got to play with him this morning. I was playing guitar and, unprompted, he brought his cello down and we sang through a few songs. It's really a great feeling. I had a biology teacher at Earlham who started a lecture one day by saying, \"Let's talk today about different ways that plants survive the winter. Some go dormant, drop their leaves, others drop seeds.\" And I thought that we are the kind that drops seeds. But in our case, if we're lucky, we get to live long enough as parents, that we overlap some with the new little people that have grown up, and we get to know each other for a while. Despite our infatuation with individuality in the western world, in many ways I really am my mother and father. And the life energy that animated them was their parents, before it became them. So I like to, in my mind, keep tracing this back and be aware of the fact that the thing that's now called me, that life force, has been alive in some sense, absolutely uninterrupted, not even for a second, all the way back to...let's see...not just the beginning of human beings, but whatever creatures became human beings, and back to \u2014 oh my God \u2014 the beginning of life itself on earth. We have a long, long history in our bones of figuring out a lot of challenging situations, for millions of years, and figuring out how to survive, at least for a while. Sandor: Talk about your work.Paul Tinkerhess: Even though my line of work is about the definition of mundane, selling shoes, I like to humor myself by thinking that it's a somewhat meaningful line of work; that your feet are, after all, your point of contact with Mother Earth. Sometimes people come into the store kind of grumpy, and I like to think maybe they have a thorn in their paw, maybe things are not going so well in their life, and they're behaving the way they are for some reason. If we can treat them with respect, and sometimes, if we can get some comfortable shoes on their feet, (Laughter) over the course of an extended relationship that might extend, as it has with many of my customers, for many years, we change each other. So I train my employees to consider that if somebody is treating you with less than the respect that you feel you deserve, consider that maybe they need a new pair of shoes, maybe their point of contact with the earth is giving them a sense of alienation from Mother Earth. Sandor: What about dreams, goals, hopes for the future? Paul Tinkerhess: I think I find meaning in an effort to share what I see and what I experience honestly with the other fragments of life that are all around me. I think of intelligence as being not just the functioning of what's happening in my own brain, but of all living things sharing information honestly with each other. When I hear somebody saying something that is troubling to me, if I'm learning some new reality from them that's disturbing, I consider it. If I think they're giving me an accurate reflection of the truth, then I let that new truth disturb me for a while. Then, if I'm aware enough, I thank my lucky stars that I was exposed to this new bit of truth and I feel like that person put their eye into my head so I could momentarily see things from their point of view. If we do this consistently with a lot of people, I think it's possible to live as if we have eyes like a bumblebee with many different facets; seeing things from a lot of different perspectives. I'm humbled by how small my role is in the big scheme of things. I've been raised as a Quaker, and Quakers are somewhat humble people, although they do believe they have direct access to the wisdom of the maker of the Universe. (Laughter) And that they have an obligation to speak up when they feel moved by those leadings. They have believed since the beginning that we should pursue the end of war. A lot of people, when you suggest that to them, will automatically say, \"No, I think war has always been with us, and it always will be.\" So this is why I take heart by things like Daniel Quinn's writings, and others, who have pointed out that, actually, war has not been with us always. Humans in very nearly this same form have been around for hundreds of thousands of years, before we ever got onto war. So if there is something about us that sees war and feels deeply troubled by it, I think that's a very natural instinct. I do have kind of a faith that humans might be able to wrestle this under control. It's not hard for us to imagine, I don't think, a world where people could grow up without fear of war and hunger and insecurity. Let's not lament too much, but let's gather the information and then let's look forward. Forgiveness is the decision to try to change the future, rather than try to change the past. Sandor: Is that your phrase?Paul Tinkerhess: That's mine. Sandor: I like that.Paul Tinkerhess: Thank you. Let's try to figure out the truth as it is, and then make decisions about the future. It was after that conversation I had with Odetta, that I told you about earlier, that I came to build up a feeling that I'm not responsible for everything that's happened that's made things the way they are. But I am responsible for this layer of experience that I am a part of now. I'll take responsibility for that and try to do a little bit to nudge it in what seems like a good direction. ### Paul Tinkerhess and his wife, Claire, are the owners of Fourth Ave Birkenstock in Kerrytown (209 N Fourth Avenue, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104), which sells a broad selection of shoes and Tempur-Pedic mattresses. Paul founded the Water Hill Festival, which takes place on Sunday, May 6 from 2:00-6:00 p.m. around the neighborhood between Miller Ave., Brooks St., Sunset Rd. and the railroad tracks in northwest Ann Arbor.

Don't think about taking them home, since you likely cannot care for them properly. Instead, take pictures, not animals,\" he says. Children with an interest in working more closely with these animals can talk with keepers and volunteers about careers involving animals, including veterinary medicine, biology, conservation, and ecology. For children ages 13 and older, there may be volunteer opportunities that allow them to work closely with the reptiles. \"With summer coming, it's possible that kids with reliable transportation could come during morning hours to shadow our keepers for training sessions,\" says Creswell. During the school year, volunteers are most needed between 2:00 and 6:00 p.m. For families considering adding a reptile pet to their own homes, GLSZ will educate them about proper animal care. A number of abandoned reptiles are available for adoption from the GLZS; however, adopters must complete education and provide proof of a proper enclosure in which to house the animal. \"It's useful to have a family look at the very large enclosures we have here at the facility so they can ask themselves if they can replicate the size, lighting, and humidity at home,\" says Creswell. \"Often, a child desires a pet and then, after a few years, they lose interest, go off to college, and the animal gets passed from family to family and can experience neglect or improper care. We rescue these animals and rehabilitate and try to re-home them, but it's easier on everyone if people receive education before taking on a pet like this.\" Teachers, home-school groups, Scouts, and other organizations are taking advantage of the field trips and educational presentations offered by GLZS. In order to educate children about exotic reptiles and Michigan species, GLZS offers 30-45 minute presentations tailored to ages from preschool through high school. All programs are matched with the Michigan State Science GLCEs (Grade Level Content Expectations) to enhance and reinforce what students learn in their classrooms. Creswell notes that their programs \"really work on helping kids learn overall generalities about animals and their environment, rather than teaching simple facts. For example, we might show children a particular lizard species and then ask whether that animal would make its home on the ground or in a tree...Or we might ask why the bearded dragon has all those sharp spines on its body and help kids understand that you don't want to look too appetizing if you spend your days basking in the sun on a rock, in clear view of your predators.\" Field trips are available mornings and afternoons. In addition, birthday parties can be scheduled for weekends or weekdays. Party guests will enjoy an educational program as well as time for cake, gifts, and other activities. In addition, beginning in June, GLZS will offer half-day summer camp sessions for children who have completed grades two and up. Individuals and families can stop by A World of Discovery at 6885 Jackson Road anytime during business hours (10 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily) to observe the animals. Fees are $5 for children ages 3-11, $7 for ages 12 and up, and $5 for seniors ($45 for annual family membership with unlimited admission). To schedule a field trip or birthday party or to inquire about volunteer opportunities for children and adults, please contact Curator John Lebert at (734) 332-1628 or email johnlebert@glzszoo.com.

Garrison guided students toward better choices and encouraged them to look beyond the next move. \"That's a strategic move, but what else might we try?\" he asks, pausing to allow students to think. The girls in the class raised their hands often, eager to share their ideas. \"Girls do very well with chess at this age,\" says Garrison, \"since they are sometimes a little less impulsive, and are willing to think and strategize a bit longer than some boys do before making decisions.\" When schools close for the summer, Garrison continues teaching at his summer day camps, which he's organized since 1999. Camp offerings include both chess and strategy games such as Risk, Stratego, Shogi, and Go. \"The most important thing about my summer camps is that we have fun! That's the main focus in the summer,\" he says.The camps are held at the Go Like the Wind Montessori School near Dixboro, where kids have access to a 40-acre playground for outdoor activities, in addition to several hours of chess or strategy game playing and instruction. Can kids really play chess for five or six hours a day at camp? \"Yes!\" says Garrison. \"What we hear most often from parents is that kids don't come home tired of chess, they come home wanting to play more chess!\" Garrison also offers advice for parents of young chess players. \"If a parent is playing with a child, I don't encourage them to be soft on them. Instead, if the parent gets ahead, I encourage them to turn the board around and continue from there. It is good for a child's ego to play from a winning position, rather than always losing, plus it's a great way to teach them how to finish a game from a winning position,\" he explains.

Great Lakes Zoological Society's World of Discovery \"I've been fascinated by reptiles and amphibians since I was a small child,\" says Mark Creswell, founder and board president of Ann Arbor's newly opened Great Lakes Zoological Society's (GLZS) A World of Discovery Conservation & Rescue Center. \"The very first thing I bought when I started getting an allowance was a book on reptiles.\" Creswell and his wife, Jane, have turned his childhood passion for reptiles into a non-profit educational indoor zoo experience featuring reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates, birds, and other exhibits. Although Creswell's interest in reptiles started at an early age, his initial career path did not involve the creatures. He worked in Warner-Lambert's pharmaceutical research division in Ann Arbor and later founded a biotech services company. However, starting in 2003, \"I decided I could do something for animals. My wife and I began reptile rescue. We rescued a pet snake from someone and we saw an immediate need for rescues for both reptiles and amphibians,\" Creswell says. For the first five years, the Creswells' home functioned as a reptile rescue sanctuary for unwanted or abandoned pets. In 2008, they incorporated and in 2009, they hired a curator and received 501c3 status as a non-profit organization. Soon, their organization outgrew their home and they leased a 2,500-square-foot facility; however, it was not zoned to be open to the public. \"It just couldn't allow us to provide the education component we desired,\" says Creswell. In January 2011, they began renovations on their current 6,100-square-foot indoor zoo, which opened to the public in September 2011. Guests to the facility are free to view the spacious, climate-controlled enclosures housing dozens of reptiles, amphibians, and other creatures. Volunteer educators and professional keepers bring animals out of their enclosures to allow guests to touch and learn about the different species. Residents include an 18-foot reticulated python, a pair of 85-pound Sulcata tortoises, several species of monitor lizard, and beaded lizards, as well as Madagascar hissing cockroaches, and many other species from around the world. Children visiting the exotic snakes, tortoises, and lizards are clearly excited just to be in the presence of such interesting creatures; however, Creswell hopes that the The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 62 New, Fun, and Just Plain Cool \"We hope [kids will] know what to do if they encounter wild reptiles or other creatures in the woods.

By Nieka Apell Ray Garrison's Chess for Children It's 7:45 on a Wednesday morning, and while many elementary school children are just being pried from their beds, a group of nearly 30 Bach Elementary School students gathers in the school's Media Center, eager to find a partner and dive into a game of chess. Taught by Ann Arborite Ray Garrison, this Ann Arbor Rec & Ed activity has kids excited to come to school more than an hour early. Like the students he teaches, Garrison learned chess as a child. He was initially taught by his father, a high school math teacher. The younger Garrison served as president of the Chess Club at Michigan State University and, by 1993, he earned the level of \"Expert\" from the U.S. Chess Federation. While he's always been passionate about chess, Garrison's initial career path led him in a different direction. While working as a controller in the resort industry, he began teaching chess part time. In 1997, he purchased a fledgling retail chess store, Chess Express, in Ann Arbor. Garrison began leading a weekly chess club, and discovered that his true passion in life is teaching chess, especially to children. In 2000, Garrison sold the store to an employee and turned his full attention to teaching chess in and around Ann Arbor. His company is called Arbor Chess and he currently teaches at many public and private schools, and conducts private chess lessons in people's homes. Garrison's students have found great success at state and even national levels. In 2011, King Elementary won the K-5 state championship sponsored by the Michigan Chess Association for the fourth consecutive year and Thurston Elementary took second place. The rewards Garrison reaps from teaching chess to children are less about championships and more about watching the children grow as they develop new skills. \"I really enjoy watching kids improve, seeing the absolute joy on their faces, and also helping them develop their critical thinking skills,\" says Garrison. Although he teaches students as young as three or four years old, Garrison believes that second grade is the ideal age to begin learning chess. \"It's the age when they can usually catch right on and begin to enjoy it quickly. It [becoming successful at chess] builds their ego. They get very excited when they win and sometimes very frustrated when they don't, but even that frustration can be very motivating to learn more,\" he explains. Students in Garrison's morning chess class at Bach are visibly excited to learn. After playing against classmates, students began asking Garrison when he'll teach them new strategies. Using a large chessboard diagram on the wall, Garrison Continued on page 64Garrison's students have found great success at state and even national levels. In 2011, King Elementary won the K-5 state championship sponsored by the Michigan Chess Association for the fourth consecutive year and Thurston Elementary took second place. In 2003, \"We rescued a pet snake from someone and we saw an immediate need for rescues for both reptiles and amphibians.\" For the first five years, the Creswells' home functioned as a reptile rescue sanctuary for unwanted or abandoned pets. Crazy Wisdom Kids in the Community Garrison guided students toward better choices and encouraged them to look beyond the next move. \"That's a strategic move, but what else might we try?\" he asks, pausing to allow students to think.\"What we hear most often from parents is that kids don't come home [from Chess Camp] tired of chess, they come home wanting to play more chess!\"Children with an interest in working more closely with these animals can talk with keepers and volunteers about careers involving animals, including veterinary medicine, biology, conservation, and ecology. As Ratkovich's own relationship with horses grew, however, she realized there was much more than just learning to ride. Today, her programs at Red Hawk Ranch in Dexter focus on \"partnering with horses and nature to facilitate personal growth and professional development.\" Red Hawk Ranch, a serene property with open vistas and circling hawks, is named for the Tennessee Walker horse who joined Ratkovich's family in 2004 and was instrumental in shaping her understanding of horses. After a fall from a horse left her injured, Ratkovich was hesitant to continue with horses at all. Jayne found Red Hawk on the Internet and \"everyone fell in love with him at first sight,\" says Ratkovich. Red Hawk was a tender, gentle presence in their lives and allowed her to ride again without fear. Sadly, six months later, Red Hawk began suffering seizures and it was no longer safe for him to be ridden. Ratkovich \"began to learn that there was much more to joining with a horse than learning to walk, trot, and canter.\" She spent many hours with the horse, sharing time in the sun together. Red Hawk's seizures grew too severe and they were forced to allow him to \"cross over,\" but Ratkovich still feels his lasting presence on her ranch and in what he taught her. Prior to her involvement with horses, Ratkovich completed a master's degree in human development from the Erickson Institute in Chicago and a certificate in family therapy from Northwestern. When her own children were small, she ran an in-home daycare center. She considered becoming a therapist, but felt that \"therapy is individualized. Here at the Ranch, I want to build a community.\" Ratkovich began to explore partnering with horses and helping others learn about themselves alongside horses. She discovered the book The Tao of Equus by Linda Kohanov and studied at her ranch in Arizona. She says she \"realized her life dreams\" when, in 2010, she received her Certificate in Equine Facilitated Learning from a program created by Jackie Stevenson at Lake Erie College in Ohio. The purchase of the Red Hawk Ranch property in April 2011 allows Ratkovich to have a place to combine her passion for horses with her talents for leading groups, and helping children and adults realize their own life dreams while deepening their relationships, with the help of human and equine partners. Ratkovich says that partnering with horses can be especially powerful for teenagers. \"Teenagers are working on making some important life decisions,\" she explains. \"We [parents] talk to them about making money, about what they are supposed to do with their lives. Here, they can take time and have a place to think about other things that are important to them.\" Ratkovich's three horses are instrumental in this process. \"It's very powerful when the teens, the tough kids, come in,\" says Ratkovich. \"They are all swagger, with pants down, too much makeup on. They are thinking, 'I have to be this person.' And then they find a connection with these horses, who don't care about clothes or money, and it all breaks down. Then the kids can start thinking about their own lives differently.\" A unique thing about horses, explains Ratkovich, is that while they are very large and powerful, they are also social, pack animals. \"That means when someone around them feels fear or is having other emotions like sadness or anxiety, they notice that and will often come over and act in a way that shows awareness of [the other's] feelings. That makes them different from many other animals, such as dogs, that people often partner with in therapies,\" she says. Because of horses' empathy, some people also find it easier to tell their personal narratives to horses, rather than to a therapist or other human. Ratkovich says she encourages people to \"tell [the horses] their stories, or even just to silently think about their stories in the horses' presence.\"Red Hawk Ranch: Experiential Learning With Horses Diane Ratkovich says that, for her family, \"horses were a bonding experience,\" beginning when her daughter, Jayne, developed a passion for horses in third grade. Ratkovich followed her daughter as a \"horse mom\" as Jayne competed on the Pioneer High School Equestrian team.Continued from page 63The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 64 [The] Ranch...is named for the Tennessee Walker horse who joined Diane Ratkovich's family in 2004 and was instrumental in shaping her understanding of horses.Simply spending time with a horse can do great things for a child. \"Being with a horse helps build a child's infrastructure. When you learn to care for a horse, you build a relationship. And when you build a relationship with a 1,200-pound horse and you get that horse to come to you, that is a very empowering thing. It can also really help children learn to trust their intuition to believe that they are capable of making good choices.\" Red Hawk Ranch is incorporated as a non-profit in Michigan. They began offering a variety of programs in April, including half- and full-day experiences for families, teens, and younger children. In addition, Red Hawk Ranch will hold \"Kreative Kids Horse Kamp\" sessions in July and August and will host children's birthday parties. Individualized programs for families, Scouts or other groups of children, and for businesses and not-for-profit organizations, are also available. Ratkovich wants Red Hawk Ranch to be a place where people can create and deepen their own community. \"People may want to host a drumming circle out here or a potluck, or come together around a specific topic \u2014 and this is a wonderful environment for that,\" she says. The common theme in all her programs is to provide a space for building relationships. \"I want to create a place where you can check your cell phones at the door and really focus on deepening relationships and making decisions about what's really important in our lives.\" To learn more about Red Hawk Ranch, visit their website at www.redhawkranch. org/workshops/ or contact Diane Ratkovich at (734) 726-4295 (726-HAWK) or myredhawk@gmail.com. Ann Arbor District Library's Summer Game Until last summer, the basics of the Ann Arbor District Library's (AADL) Summer Reading Program had remained largely unchanged for years. Children read a set number of books, recorded their titles, and exchanged these paper lists for prizes. The program underwent a radical change last summer, however, with the launch of the AADL Summer Game, a combination of online and in-person games, activities, events \u2014 and incentives for much more reading! Eli Neiburger, associate director of IT and production, and mastermind behind the revamped Summer Game, said that changes stemmed largely from what the AADL had been hearing from parents about the paper game. \"What we heard from so many parents was that the paper game was making kids read less. It's inherently prescriptive \u2014 you read ten books, you get your ice cream cone or other prize, and then you feel done,\" he says. \"The whole point of the new game is to keep kids' minds active and to keep them excited about reading and learning all summer long.\" Summer 2011, the inaugural year of the Summer Game, saw more than 5,000 children and adults participate in the online activities by logging books and other media completed, in exchange for points. In addition, players could earn points by finding codes when visiting the various library branches, attending library events such as storytimes and computer and craft classes, and for completing both online and on-foot scavenger hunts. Points could be redeemed for actual prizes, including AADL shirts, hats, water bottles, limited edition chocolate from local favorite Schakolad, and so on. Players who attended events and completed activities also earned \"badges,\" virtual emblems displayed on a player's account that indicate his or her successes. The result of these changes was astounding. According to Neiburger, the AADL saw double the number of hits per month during last summer's Game and double the usual attendance at many library events. Many people visited library branches they had never visited before, in order to obtain codes. For example, some returned several times to the Traverwood Branch to visit the Cecropia moth caterpillars; every time the caterpillars moved through a new stage of development, a new code appeared on their enclosure.Neiburger explains that the points, badges, and prizes are a great source of motivation for many people to continue reading throughout entire summer. In addition, however, he notes that the design of the new Summer Game \"is a framework for incentivizing the skills that our kids will need to succeed in the world.\" He notes that the Summer Game helps teach skills such as how to be a positive member of an online community, how to write quality reviews of media, how to tag photos, and how to work within a moderated framework. \"The Game is a framework on which to hang the fun \u2014 the fun is first!\" emphasizes Neiburger. \"But there is still a lot of really important learning that can happen here.\" Neiburger says that many of the online trivia games or scavenger hunts are specifically aimed at helping children learn web-searching skills. \"Searching the web is different from the way we traditionally searched for information in a card catalog organized by subjects,\" he says. For instance, the \"Great Scott\" badge from last year's game taught children how to use quotation marks to narrow a search. One change for the 2012 Summer Game is that every badge will offer hidden hints to help find the answers. Hidden hints will be available at any library desk \u2014 an incentive to get kids to want to come to the libraries often. In addition, random hints will be generated for badges that one does not yet have, every time one logs in. This random generation of clues is based on computer gaming concepts familiar to many teens, and motivates them to continue playing the Game. Other improvements include the ability to form online teams and the new prizes that will be offered. Other changes for the 2012 Summer Game are also based on computer gaming, including the new \"Points-o-Matic Click-o-Tron,\" which allows players to \"grind,\" or to earn points quickly, by tagging and adding keywords to old photographs in the Library's expansive collection. Neiburger explains that there are more than 900,000 old Ann Arbor News photographs held digitally in the AADL's collections. \"There's a good reason most of these were never published,\" says Neiburger, \"but the truth is, they do not exist anywhere else and we do not have the resources to effectively sort through them all.\" Summer Game players also will be able to vote on the best photos, so that these will receive priority attention in the AADL's archives. Similarly, other badges will help the AADL to improve its own catalog. \"It's a bottomless pit of work, finding mistakes,\" says Neiburger. \"Last summer, over 400 players earned the badge for finding a mistake in the Library's own catalog! It really helped us clean up.\" More important than badges and prizes, however, are the intangible ways that families have benefited from improvements to the AADL Summer Reading Program. \"Absolutely the most gratifying part of creating the Summer Game was that we took something previously just for kids \u2014 the paper Summer Reading Program \u2014 and turned it into something for all ages. Grandparents were playing it online with their grandchildren \u2014 even if they don't live in the same state!\" says Neiburger. In addition, a popular online and on-foot scavenger hunt last summer sent families out into the community to research Ann Arbor history. \"The Ann Arbor History badges guided kids and families through photos and information about the history of businesses and the fire and police in Ann Arbor, and then got them into downtown to look at the glass [historical display] panels to get those codes. We heard from a lot of players that this was their first time in downtown Ann Arbor!\" Says Neiburger, \"The great thing about this program is that families can make what they want of it. If you want, you can just play the traditional paper game, earning a prize at five books, a book at ten books, maybe collect a few extra codes at storytime \u2014 or you can engage in any other ways you choose.\" Players of all ages may pick up a paper game card with instructions on how to play the Summer Game beginning June 15 at any AADL branch or visit the Summer Game website at play.aadl.org.

Tacy Sallen Frog Holler intern 2011The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 66 By Annie Zirkel The \"turn that thing off\" battle has been raging around the planet ever since families started bringing magical picture boxes into their homes. It has joined the ranks of \"say please,\" \"don't hit and \"did you hear me?\" as common frustrated utterances by parents. Of course, back in my day only one thing had us zoned-out, zombie-like, sprawled upside-down on the couch, and mesmerized by Jan and Marsha and Will Robinson. But, like my kids, I was pretty good at negotiation or some other resistant ploy like \"it's almost over\" or \"I just started watching\" to get my fix. Not surprisingly, this often prompted my mom to angrily turn it off or have my siblings and I begrudgingly comply, though usually in slow motion and with as much attitude as we could get away with. So while some things are no worse than when we were young, I believe we do have more challenges today. First, there are so many more things to turn off \u2014 from the computer to the Xbox and PlayStation, from iPods and iPads to hand-held gaming devices and phones that do a little of everything \u2014 and I didn't even mention TVs. Second, it is not just kids getting caught in these beams of light. There is a multi-generational attraction. From Facebook to e-mails, from 24/7 news channels to consuming games for all ages, there is something for everyone. In many homes, management of this new technology is a constant battle. Or worse, the battle is over and screens won. To make it even more challenging, even if you are trying to be conscious consumers, there is a whole village out there making it harder. If you want your child to have friends, especially if you have sons, they will be seen as outliers if they aren't playing the latest video game or don't know what it is. Like frogs in that pot of slowly boiling water, we all need to be noticing the temperature rising. We know that new technologies are affecting how children's brains are being wired. Their face-to-face social skills, physical skills, and skills for finding alternative things to do are being short-circuited. Their development of sustained attention and traits like empathy, compassion, and gratitude are being malnourished. At the extreme, there are children (and adults) who are truly becoming addicted to this technology. Whether playing video games or checking in online, it's creating a very controlling presence in their lives. In the blink of an eye, technology has taken over our \"dying of boredom\" angst, which does not bode well for the benefits of boredom, such as problem solving, creativity, and self-motivation to make things happen. There is a real irony in choosing angry birds over real birds, Guitar Hero over learning to play a real guitar, World of Warcraft over arts and crafts (and, yes, boys can do crafts). Why choose Facebook over real face time or real books, texting over talking to the people right in front of you, or reality TV shows over creating our own awesome realities? To be clear, I am not a purist or willing to take my family off the grid. I also believe that there are many advantages to this new world and it can be fun, too. But we need better leadership in our homes and in our communities to make sure that we are in charge of this new world and not the other way around. I've created the acronym MUTE (Mindful Use of Technology and Electronics) to at least remember my goal of limiting and monitoring our family's consumption of technology. It is the updated, playful version of \"turn that thing off\" \u2014 as in, \"MUTE it or lose it!\"Here are ten MUTE suggestions: 1. Ask ques tions and have conversations. Have your child complete this sentence: I would rather be on screens (play video games, be at the computer, watch TV) than _____________. Then have them answer the question: I would rather do _______________ than be on screens. If they can't think of many things for the second sentence, you know you need some restructuring. Other questions include: What would life be like without these screens? Could we survive? How did we survive before? 2. Enc ourage thoughtfulness around beneficial versus time-wasting uses of technology and electronics. Is there a physical element? A deeper social connection? A learning opportunity? Are you enhancing your communication skills? Do you get to be creative? Or did you just get behind on homework? 3. T each manners around texting and talking on the phone while with others. Frustration around the lack of etiquette here is somewhat misplaced. Remember this is new technology and we all need to learn how to use it. Consider the goal of: wherever you are, be present. 4. Put up barrier s \u2014 both physical and personal contract-based \u2014 to make access less mindless. If you have every gadget, game, and gizmo \u2014 well, duh. If you have screens in every room, then you have said that this is really important to you. But if that is not your intention, then put what really matters first. Physical or creative play, homework, and chores can come before screens. Though I do warn parents not to make screen time the motivator for everything. We want to encourage other activities for their own sakes. We read a book because it has a different pace than reading online or playing video games or watching a movie. We do chores because the house needs to be taken care of, and so on. 5. Lead b y example and lead out loud. Let your children see when you are struggling to keep your own guidelines for time on screens. And, hopefully, let them see you reset your commitment to keeping that line well defined. 6. Se t clear screen-free times such as meals, driving to school, or certain hours of the day when everyone looks away from the lights. 7. Chang e your routine. Does every weekend revolve around screens? Does every evening end with the TV or the computer? Commit to changing that up. 8. Be e ven bolder and commit to weekly screen-free days or join the Screen-Free Week Challenge through Campaign for Commercial-Free Childhood (which this year is April 30 through May 6). They also have great resources to help. 9. Go be yond your own family. This is a societal concern. Challenge \u2014 as kindly as possible \u2014 other parents to consider keeping MUTE rules for friend and family time. Initiate curious conversations at gatherings and school meetings. Ask your children's school to support education about this new world. Encourage your neighborhood, children's peer group, or school to take a screen-free challenge. 10. K now when it is a more serious issue. If your child's reactions to non-screen time are more than just typical resistance or crankiness, especially if the battles are deteriorating into serious anger (on both sides), or include blatant defiance or consistent lying or sneaking to get their technology fix, it is time to get help. Technology is creating very rapid change in our world, especially for our children. But it is their reality and we need to help them become wise to the edges of this endeavor while teaching them how to manage it. Conscious screen time consumption is a reasonable goal. ### Annie Zirkel, L.P .C., is an Ann Arbor based parenting consultant, workshop presenter, and the author of You'll Thank Me Later \u2014 A Guide to Raising Grateful Children (& Why That Matters).

Teaching Children to Tame Technology (Formerly Known as \"Turn That Thing Off\") Why choose Facebook over real face time or real books, texting over talking to the people right in front of you, or reality TV shows over creating our own awesome realities?The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 67 By Karen Foulke Larson Walks in nearby Mallett's Creek are part of the regular routine for several classrooms of students at Ann Arbor Learning Community (AALC), a public K-8 charter school. Like many of his classmates, nine-year-old Andrew Vincent gets excited about walks in Mallett's Creek, a tributary of the Huron River. Andrew's face lights up when he talks about studying the creek, and he describes the creek as a \"classroom outside of the classroom.\" For Andrew Vincent and his classmates, learning about the creek is one of the ways they are active as citizen-stewards as part of the Southeast Michigan Stewardship (SEMIS) Coalition. AALC has been part of the SEMIS Coalition for three years. SEMIS facilitates school- community partnerships to create EcoJustice and Place-Based learning experiences that provide students the opportunity to act as citizen-stewards of their communities and the Great Lakes. In addition, the coalition provides professional development for teachers, assists with stewardship projects, and facilitates school-community collaborations. SEMIS is coordinated by a dedicated group of Eastern Michigan University (EMU) professors. Ethan Lowenstein, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Curriculum and Instruction, serves as the director of SEMIS and the liaison for AALC and Honey Creek Community School (which is also a public K-8 charter school). AALC and Honey Creek are currently the only two schools in Washtenaw County that participate in SEMIS. There are six Detroit schools and one Dearborn school in the coalition. SEMIS is one of eight state-wide hubs supported by the Great Lakes Stewardship Initiative (GLSI), and EMU provides critical resources. Because of the dedication of the people involved, a \"shoestring budget\" is stretched to maximize its potential. Lowenstein says that schools are lining up to become involved, but fundraising is critical to making that possible. More EMU professors are getting involved in SEMIS, along with professors from the University of Michigan - Dearborn. Lowenstein says, \"The charge from the GLSI was to become a regional presence, and we are well on our way...There is a real feeling of movement building right now as more and more people become interested in joining and contributing to the powerful work being done in the schools.\" A New Way of Looking At The WorldSEMIS EcoJustice framework encourages students to provide a deeper analysis of causes of social and environmental problems. Lowenstein points out that recycling does not address the cause. He says, \"We help our teachers think about cultural causes.\" For some students that means a new awareness of how consumerism is deeply rooted in society. For example, Mary Magos' 2 nd/3rd grade class at AALC learned about \"The Story of Stuff,\" which examines the life cycle of what we make, use, and throw away. When the story of bottled water was shared at an AALC community meeting, Magos says students were surprised to learn that recycling water bottles doesn't mean they won't end up in a landfill. During the 2010-2011 school year, water was the focus of environmental education at AALC. Several students wrote for \"The Truth About Water\" newsletter, which included updates on the local creek, water survey results, the Great Lakes, and The Clean Water Act. The newsletter included a water use survey, and Magos says many AALC families were surprised by their amount of water usage.

Andrew and his classmates are citizen stewards of the creek in partnership with the Huron River Watershed Council. Continued on page 68The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 69 SEMIS also offers an annual Summer Institute for teachers. Each summer focuses on an ecological theme and providing opportunities for cultural-ecological analysis, project planning, and community action. 2011's theme was \"Detroit as Our Place: Ecological, Economic & Historical Stories.\" Part of the 2011 Summer Institute involved a bus tour of Detroit that included the point of view of the plants and the buildings as place markers in history and the story they tell. Waters says the success of Detroit is in many ways tied to the success of Michigan, and he praises the initiatives (gardens, open waterways, and sustainable communities) that other communities can learn from Detroit. Thompson says, \"The SEMIS Summer Institute was a very powerful experience.\" Building the CoalitionDetroit is important for all SEMIS students and teachers, including those who live outside of Detroit. Attendance at Great Lakes Bioneers Detroit (GLBD) is an annual event for SEMIS schools. In October, for the second year in a row, Marissa Kowalczuk took a group of AALC students to GLBD. Bioneers seeks innovative approaches to environmental and social challenges. The organization believes that building connections between people who share a commitment to solving these issues can transform communities. Marchyok credits SEMIS' director Lowenstein with being \"a really great community builder.\" Waters says Lowenstein is \"very energetic and enthusiastic. He has the ability to see connections and the potential for connections that would not be apparent.\" Magos appreciates Lowenstein for being \"empathetic, listening to any idea...and pushing us to think more deeply.\" Martusewicz, who helped develop SEMIS, is still very involved and provides important teaching about the social justice point of view. Marchyok says, \"We all have a voice. We all have needs. No one's needs are more important. The more people who take that perspective of nature, the less likely we are to take it over and dominate it.\" FutureLowenstein describes the work of SEMIS as \"preparing the soil and bringing people together in a coalition\" without knowing what the results will be. He says that as he thinks about the future of AALC and Honey Creek, \"I can't predict what will happen, but I know it will be amazing.\" His enthusiasm is matched by the teachers and students involved with SEMIS. There are many students who share AALC student Andrew Vincent's perspective about the importance and fun of learning more about the environment. Vincent says it important to study the environment, \"because it makes you know more about your world,\" and he says, \"It's fun!\" Thompson sums her feelings about SEMIS experiences. She says, \"I leave any SEMIS time refreshed and motivated to make every teaching moment loaded with the deepest impact it can have.\" ### This is a critical time for the Southeast Michigan Stewardship Coalition as the coalition continues to grow.

AALC's physical education teacher, Gretchen Plamondon, and their art and drama teacher, Marissa Kowalczuk, collaborated to help students combine dance and poetry in a unique eco-exploration called \"Water: A Call to Action.\" Kowalczuk's Eco-Exploration class focused on the power of the public voice and how everyone has the ability to be an advocate or a steward. The results were so inspiring that the collaboration continued this year. One of the highlights of this year's project was when Rebecca Martusewicz, Ed.D., SEMIS' Co-Director and Associate Director of Programming, and Director of the EcoJustice Education M.A. program at EMU, worked with Kowalczuk's middle school students to help them learn about the imbalance of power in relationships including culture vs. nature. Creating CommunityMagos enthusiastically acknowledges that SEMIS is a \"good fit\" for AALC's mission and commitment to environmental education. SEMIS provides opportunities for students to be out in the community as activists. One example of that was Global Service Youth Day in April 2011 when Magos' class partnered with two Detroit schools, Divine Child High School and Allen Academy, and Greening of Detroit to plant trees in McShane Park in Detroit. The tree planting project represented the continuation of student-planned service opportunities that connect intergenerational service-learning with work the students were doing in the classroom. Magos' students drew pictures and wrote about their experiences. One student's entry says, \"It took a lot of time and teamwork to plant the tree, but we did it.\" Another student's summary says, \"Planting a tree is really hard, but I had fun. The world is cool.\" Environmental education is also important to Honey Creek Community School. Al Waters, Executive Director, says Honey Creek welcomes the opportunity SEMIS provides to integrate academic service learning and environmental education and adds it's a \"great opportunity to positively impact the community.\" Tracey Marchyok, a 4 th/5th grade teacher at AALC, compares the connections between SEMIS schools to tributaries flowing together and the way water connects us. Last October, 4th and 5th graders from Honey Creek and AALC had their first combined event at Lillie Park in Pittsfield Township. Three Honey Creek teachers and three AALC teachers all prepared nature based activities for the students to rotate through. Johnny Thompson, a 4 th/5th grade teacher at Honey Creek, says, \"Our 4th and 5th grade students were really excited at the prospect of meeting another group of 4th and 5th graders from the area! They enjoyed the field trip a great deal.\" That field trip was the first step in a new partnership between Honey Creek and AALC's 4 th and 5th grade students. In February, Marchyok visited Honey Creek to teach Thompson's students a lesson on world water and local water. She led a discussion of questions about water \u2014 including \"How did Honey Creek get its name?\" \u2014 and joined Thompson and her students for an exploration of Honey Creek. Both teachers and their students were excited about the ongoing connections and dialogue about the two schools' local creeks. Back in February, the teachers also started making plans for an end of the school year picnic to bring their classes together. Spring was also a busy time for three classrooms at AALC (Kindergarten - 3 rd grade) who have spent time planting gardens for Arbor Hospice. Several AALC teachers applied for grant money at the start of the school year to design and plant gardens. AALC teachers planned and worked throughout the year to provide educational lessons that led up to the planting experience. A core aspect of SEMIS involves creating school-community partnerships. SEMIS has more than twenty community partners, including the Huron River Watershed Council and the Leslie Science and Nature Center in Ann Arbor, and the Greening of Detroit and Matrix Theatre Company in Detroit. For example, Marchyok has been working for three years with the Huron River Watershed Council on the Mallett's Creek project. As stewards, AALC students have participated in World Water Monitoring Day, conducted a stream habitat survey, and are involved in ongoing observation, clean-up, and monitoring. Magos appreciates the \"pairings\" that \"allow teachers and students to gain support on projects and make connections with our community.\" Professional DevelopmentAs part of SEMIS, schools take part in professional development. Honey Creek's calendar included two professional development days for their teachers this spring. Lowenstein says, \"Building on strengths is part of SEMIS' asset-based approach to coalition building and school change.\" He adds, \"The Southeast Michigan Stewardship Coalition is purposefully designed to help schools like Honey Creek and AALC build on their strengths, take their teaching to a whole new level, and help them sustain this deep work over time.\"By Karen Foulke Larson When Southeast Michigan Stewardship (SEMIS) Coalition director Ethan Lowenstein, Ph.D., talks about how students at Ann Arbor Learning Community (AALC) learned about bats and their habits, he gets excited. SEMIS encourages deeper thinking and problem solving about environmental issues. Last year, while learning about the habitats and roles of bats in Michigan ecosystems, Mary Magos' and Wendy Nagle's 2 nd and 3rd grade students learned that human activities are destroying bats' natural habitats. The students and teachers felt they needed to do something about the problem. The classes wanted to create places where bats can live without the threat of losing their homes. As Lowenstein enthusiastically shares, the first step was for the students to learn about bats and educate their school community to combat misinformation about bats being dangerous. Lowenstein says, \"Part of that educational process was to see how bats are enmeshed in the web of life.\" Magos' and Nagle's classes wrote letters to local businesses explaining what they were learning about bats and habitats and that they were looking for partners to support the work. Nagle says, \"My students wrote letters to many local area businesses and people who they thought might be willing to hang a bat house. In these letters, they tried to teach the recipients all that they had learned about bats, and why they are of value to us and our area.\" Lowenstein praises the teachers and students for their \"active stewardship role.\" One of the letters received an enthusiastic response from AALC's neighbor on Research Park Drive, Subaru Research & Development. Tiffani Pace from Subaru sent a letter responding that Subaru \"could not wait to assist\" with the nocturnal habitat project. Subaru also donated $200 for the project! Pace says that the project fits with Subaru's corporate social responsibility program to help the environment and the community. She was there for the installation of the bat houses and remembers the kids being really excited. \"We all were,\" she says. The bat houses built by AALC students were installed at many locations in addition to Subaru, including students' houses, an orchard, a pre-school, and a golf course. Aerin and Josh Brownlee's son, Gram, took part in the bat project as a student in Magos' class. The Brownlees provided pre-cut wood and hammers and helped the students in Magos' class construct the bat houses. Aerin Brownlee says, \"I like the opportunities that SEMIS gives Gram to get involved and advocate for the environment.\" SEMIS ' guiding principles A strong and viable Great Lakes ecosystem includes human communities nested within and interdependent with other diverse living systems including water, soil, air, plant, and animal species. Stewardship of the Great Lakes in Southeast Michigan is defined by the ability to connect with and protect one's \"place.\" This requires collaboration with others, recognizing connections to larger economic and political systems, and understanding the impact of human cultures on the ecosystems in which they are nested. Human cultures create beliefs and behaviors that affect social and ecological systems. Thus, social and ecological justice are interrelated and must be addressed together. A sustainable Southeastern Michigan depends upon diversity \u2014 both human and ecological \u2014 and is thus best served by strong democratic and collaborative systems. The first step was for the students to learn about bats and educate their school community to combat misinformation about bats being dangerous. The bat houses built by AALC students were installed at many locations in addition to Subaru, including students' houses, an orchard, a pre-school, and a golf course.Bats Need Homes T oo \"Planting a tree is really hard, but I had fun.\" - Ann Arbor Learning Community StudentFinding Homes for Bat Houses Gwenyth Darling (left) and Sadye Rasmussen (right) present Scott Spooner, golf course superintendent of Ann Arbor's Leslie Park Golf Courses, with one of the bat houses built by students from Ann Arbor Learning Community. Planting a Seed ~ Continued from page 67 Sustainable Health By Cindy Klement Reforming the Norms of \"Kids' Food\" : A Nutritionist Reflects on her Family's Legacy and How You Can Impact Yours I arrived in California to visit my daughter, Angela, and her family just as lunch was being served. Katie was delighted to report, \"Look, Grandma, I like lettuce!\" as she proceeded to eat a large piece of dark romaine, munching away with a twinkle in her eye and a smile of pride across her face. At 5 years old, Katie gets it. She loves eating healthy and says, \"Exercise is fun!\" This attitude about health comes from her mother, who once threatened she was going to write a book about the things I did to her in her upbringing entitled, \"The Mommie Dearest of the Natural World.\" However, my upbringing was dramatically different from Angela's and now Katie's. My parents owned a party store, so it was not unusual for breakfast to be Ding-Dongs and chocolate milk. Lunch was typically a white bread grape jelly sandwich (which I'd never eat), a bag of Frito's, a Nehi orange soda, and a packaged brownie that John the Farmcrest man would leave as he restocked the shelves of my parents' party store. My three siblings and I continued our junk fest after school with cookies, candies, and Kool-Aid. For dinner mom would grab a slab of beef from the back cooler, open a can of green beans, and prepare Betty Crocker's au gratin potatoes. Being the only thin child, I figured out early on that even if I didn't eat well at dinner, I would still be encouraged in the evening to drink a malted milk or indulge in potato chips. Even though my lunches were the envy of nearly every child in my class, my teacher, Mr. Montieth, found them abhorrent. From my small child's perspective, he seemed to be seven feet tall and only a hundred pounds. He was always interested in talking about health and showing the class what was in his lunch, which was as disgusting to me as mine most likely was to him. I especially recall the thermos full of sprouts and the smell of his brown, sandy beverage. Mr. Montieth took an interest in me because of my ill health as a child. I spent countless days in the hospital with severe asthma attacks and chronic constipation. Near weekly doctor visits were necessary to keep the eczema from cracking and bleeding, and allergy shots were imperative to keep the asthma somewhat under control. By the early 1970s, I had been on daily steroids for 16 years along with stool softeners, antihistamines, and getting four allergy injections each week. Boils in my armpits were not uncommon. Chronic kidney infections, inflamed skin, breathing difficulties, and allergic reactions to nearly two hundred substances led me to throw up my hands with the medical profession. I sought out a natural health practitioner from Germany who successfully helped me to navigate away from the \"party store diet\" and become more health conscious. After nine months' time of natural foods, I no longer suffered from any of the maladies I did in my childhood and was free of medication. Over 40 years later, I am still free of those illnesses. When raising my children in the late 1970s, I realized I'd become Mr. Montieth! My children drank fruit smoothies and freshly made vegetable juices with produce from our own organic vegetable garden. They drank raw goat milk and ate fresh eggs. Their diet was completely pure \u2014 no preservatives, colors, additives, or refinement. They would squeal with joy when they saw the UPS man driving up the long gravel driveway, scurrying to the table as I opened the boxes so they could sample the foods we'd ordered from Walnut Acres. Their favorite? Unsweetened carob chips. So where does my daughter's claim that I am the Joan Crawford of the natural world originate? In the very early 1980s we did not have access to all the natural remedies for children we have today, therefore I made my own. Based on Dr. John Christopher's School of Natural Health , I was able to use herbs, vinegar, garlic, and a few other foods to create my herbal medicine. Some of them tasted so horrid I'd give the kids a nickel if they'd drink it down. One formula in particular stands out in my daughter's mind: the Anti-Plague formula. I'd never seen her eyes as angry as when, after slamming down the \"herb cup,\" she asked, \"Have you even tasted this yet?!\" After admitting I had not, she then boldly announced, \"Then I get a quarter!\" ~~~ Today so many parents work and don't have the luxury of making all their foods from scratch. Ann Arbor is quite unique, however, in that we have ample healthy eating options outside of the home and six natural food stores where we can obtain the cleanest and purest food available today. As I travel around the United States presenting seminars on natural health, I realize how fortunate we are to live here. So many of the cities where I teach require folks interested in purchasing good food to travel two to three hours to even find a place to shop. When people don't have the time, resources, or knowledge to offer healthier food choices to their families, problems arise. Dr. Thomas Robinson, Stanford University Pediatrician and Obesity-Prevention Researcher, reported infants as young as seven months now drink soda, while at 19-24 months they are having dessert, soda, or chips daily. One third of young toddlers don't consume vegetables and a quarter of them have no fruit in their diet. Yet, more than a third of children's fast food meals provide 30 percent of calories from fat, with added sugars averaging 11.8 percent and up to as much as 51.6 percent of total calories. Dr. Robinson asks, \"Who's giving them French fries? Who's giving them McDonald's? They don't drive yet!\" But, parental work schedules, parenting styles, perception of family meals, and time spent in the car are several factors related to the frequent use of fast food. Even if parents are promoting healthier diets, junk food messages have become entrenched in children's every day life while playing video games, visiting websites, watching television, and in the grocery aisles. Researchers analyzed the nutritional quality of 77 food products advertised on 28 children's websites. Forty-nine of those foods met the National Institutes of Medicine's standards for \"foods to avoid\" and only five met criteria for foods to encourage. Researchers in California analyzed 235 television hours of food advertising, 50 percent of which featured junk food geared specifically toward children. Canadian researchers assessed 367 foods in supermarkets directly targeted toward children. Over 69 percent of the selected foods were also designated as \"poor quality,\" based on the number of calories originating from sugar. Siblings and peer pressure also influence children's eating habits. Commercial brands are deemed \"cooler\" than cheaper brands, and can lead to bullying simply because of what children eat at school. Cheaper brands and nonconformance to what is deemed kids' food can make a child stand out from the crowd and, in fact, several children mentioned to researchers they were being laughed at for bringing certain foods to school: rice and chicken, a salad, Chinese or Indian food, or an egg sandwich. Because of food marketing, children have their own perceptions of what kinds of foods are actually considered foods just for kids. Canadian researchers found children associated fun or unusual shapes and colors as unique to kids' foods, as well as foods that are small and that can be rolled out or stretched and anything that could be eaten with one hand or without utensils. Parents feel pressure to improve their children's diets due to the rapid increase in childhood obesity. They are expected to prepare their children for life in a commercial world by providing a range of consumption and decision-making opportunities, while simultaneously providing them with a healthy diet that counters the advertising children encounter featuring fast/junk foods. So what can parents do? Where should they start? Here are some suggestions on how to navigate raising families in a culture affected by junk food: 1 - Be a role model. When you exercise tell your children how much fun it is, and mean it. When they ride their bike or climb on the jungle gym, acknowledge their efforts and talk about how strong their muscles are. Praise them for breaking a sweat or breathing harder. \"Exercise is fun!\" 2 - Start early. The sooner children develop a taste for natural foods, the less likely parents will have to \"re-educate\" their taste buds further down the line. 3 - Get kids involved with shopping and food preparation. Yes, it takes more time when their little hands are trying to help; consider it family time that will net them years of quality living when you're no longer the sole provider of their food choices. 4 - Encourage kids to play with their food! Go online and purchase \"Food Face\" and \"Ms. Food Face\" plates. Use rainbow colored fruits and vegetables to \"decorate\" the faces and have children move the food around while eating it. Remember, they like foods that don't require utensils! 5 - When making fruit smoothies, make enough to freeze as popsicles for a terrific snack. Mix yogurt and fruit and freeze those as popsicles, as well. 6 - After shopping, wash and cut up the vegetables the children chose. Encourage them to open the refrigerator and help themselves to the vegetables. Find nut butters they enjoy or encourage hummus as a dip. 7 - With those vegetables already cut up, have salad bar night. Offer additional vegetables, olives, dried fruit, pine nuts, and empower them to make their own salads. Use the leftover vegetables for toppings on pizza that you make at home. 8 - Make \"candy\" from dried fruit and nuts. Using a food grinder, pulverize dried apricots, figs, dates, cherries, raisins, and walnuts. With wet hands, roll into balls and refrigerate. Roll them in coconut, if desired. 9 - Make air popped popcorn and add melted butter or a cold-pressed oil, then douse with nutritional yeast. Kids love this! 10 - Visit www.kidnetic.com for healthy children's games and learning about health. Do a search for \"healthy eating children\" for additional websites. The rewards of your efforts will continue on into later in life when you witness your adult children teaching your grandchildren about health and wellness.

I have never been to camp. I have no children to send to camp. But then I realized maybe I am the perfect person for this project! I have limited notions of what a camp should offer or what I would like a camp to exhibit. I could ask the tough questions or I could simply listen and let the discussions happen as they may. It was the perfect assignment and one I embraced and enjoyed thoroughly. In that spirit of discovery, I went seeking for a broad sample of local camps. After speaking with the directors of my chosen four camp programs, one thing was clear \u2014 I chose great camps. The passion these directors put into their programs is nothing short of inspirational. Even though the camps highlighted here are vastly different in themes, all of them are committed to providing the very best experience for your child this summer and every summer thereafter. My only regret? That I'm not one of the kids attending! Enjoy. YMCA Camp Al-Gon-Quian I was drawn to YMCA's Camp Al-Gon-Quian even before I was told of its rich history from Sarah Kurtz, the director of the summer camp program. Sure the downtown YMCA is located in a beautiful new building and has tons of things to do and wonderful activities for the whole family, but what really struck me was the sense of pride that came through Sarah's voice when explaining the beginnings of its Camp Al-Gon-Quian. Ann Arborite Herb Twining started Camp Al-Gon-Quian in 1925 by instituting an all-boys camp at Burt Lake. It was later purchased by the YMCA in 1968 and became co-ed in 1969 and remains so to this day.It seems fitting that Sarah grew up in the YMCA Camp system herself and fondly remembers her summers as periods of rapid growth that created memories, some often stronger than those during the school year. In fact, at Camp Al-Gon-Quian the vast majority of camp counselors also grew up attending the camp. It's that sense of loyalty and retention that drives the counselors to provide the best experience possible. Through true understanding of the community and culture of the area, they deepen the sense of belonging for the more than one thousand kids who attend each year. When asked what the mission of Camp Al-Gon-Quian is, there was no hesitation in her voice: youth development, healthy living, and social responsibility. Almost everything they do revolves around building kids' characters, confidence, and life skills \u2014 and in a fun way! For many first time YMCA camp families, it's common to inaugurate beginning Camp Al-Gon-Quian by dropping off their child for the first time at Burt Lake. The ride home at the end of camp is typically on the bus and is a wonderfully fun experience. Exciting camp activities include everything from swimming to bows and arrows, and all are grounded in a responsibility to create the safest and most nurturing experience. I asked Sarah for an example of how things have changed over the years and the adjustments made as a result. She spoke of the growing popularity of cell phones. She was proud to say that Camp Al-Gon-Quian is a cell phone and iPod Touch free zone! I was surprised to hear that most kids are actually excited by this, due to the lack of pressure it presents. A goal of the camp is to empower the child through friendship building. The children also engage in making pacts for the cabin expectations, and there are also \"safeties\" in place for children to raise issues and engage in discussions through open dialog. All meals are spent together and a sense of family and home is fostered. The feeling of \"home\" is a word and concept that arose many times throughout my interview and is what sets YMCA Camp Al-Gon-Quian apart from other camps. If sending your child to Burt Lake is not an option, rest assured that there are also day camps available locally that provide opportunities to explore nature, find new talents, try new activities, and make lasting friendships and memories. There are scholarships through the Ann Arbor YMCA's Strong Kids Campaign in place to make it possible for approximately one hundred kids each year to attend who might not be able to otherwise. The scholarship fund drive starts in March with a campaign for community donations. Every little bit helps and is appreciated.

Ann Arbor Music Center - Rock Band Boot Camp After speaking in great length with Alex Johnson, the creator and director at the Ann Arbor Music Center, about his Rock Band Summer Camp, one word comes to mind: Cool! (Even the website's cool.) Alex talks like a rock star and he exudes a passion for everything music. I half expected him to break out into song. We even spoke at an hour when most people are thinking about turning in for the night. When I joked with him about rock star stereotypes, he proudly admitted he \"may look like the stereotype, but he shatters the preconceived notions of one.\" I only had to ask him, \"Alex, tell me about your camp,\" and off he went. Alex said that when he was 15, music meant everything in the world to him and he organized a concert at his local high school. He has since devoted his life to offering a music education experience that was unavailable anywhere else. Twenty-four years of music study later, Alex has become a legacy in the Ann Arbor area due to his efforts. Ann Arbor Music Center is located in the historic Nalli Music Building, with a rock music pro-shop and a recording studio onsite. Lessons are tailored to goals and learning styles of each individual. Alex has assembled a staff of twenty-four seasoned professional musicians to assist in providing invaluable words of wisdom and well-rounded instruction. Included in that number is manager Karen King, who is more than happy to answer any questions you may have while the others are rocking out with students! Alex noticed in the summertime there was a decline in students seeking lessons. When he realized most kids were going to summer camp, the Rock Band Boot Camp was born. It is now in its ninth year. Alex developed it so that his musical students would have an ideal place to take their music to another level during the summer. Rock Band Boot Camp covers ages 8-17 and its goal is clear. Create a band, experience writing, participate in behind the scenes work, perform, and put on a show. It gets into the nitty-gritty study of rock music. Sharing the experience with seasoned professionals challenges the students to communicate ideas, achieve personal goals, and fosters open mindedness. Students learn to break stereotypes about what true success is, helping them to feel good about something. Your child won't just learn harmony, melody, and chords \u2014 they'll learn rock! This camp focuses on guitars, bass, drums, and keyboards. There are other summer camps offered as well. In the Guitar Explosion Camp students learn to build and repair guitars. There is also a Jazz Band Camp, Ukulele Summertime Uke Can Play Camp, and The Groove Line Camp for bass and drum musicians who want to learn their importance in a band. Lastly, the Songwriting/Production Camp takes kids from the inception of a song through to the CD release. I asked Alex what one statement encompasses his summer camps and he said: \"It's all about real musical experiences for serious kids with a focus on enjoyment.\" For more information about Ann Arbor Music Center, which runs camps from June-August and is for ages 8-17, visit www.a2musiccenter.com.

Guide continued on page 74 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 72 Four Summer Camps, Unlimited Possibilities Continued from page 71 KidSport (University of Michigan School of Kinesiology) It's difficult to think of Ann Arbor and not mention the University of Michigan in the same breath. I have always been a huge fan of U-M (Go Blue!), and speaking with a KidSport representative made me all that more enthusiastic. She delved deeply into descriptions of KidSport's offerings and gave me an incredibly heartfelt and informative lesson on the history and mission of her camp.For over twenty years KidSport has been focusing on human movement through a very organized and well-rounded program that teaches athletic skills in a less competitive environment. The interview happened to fall during an exciting time, as they were working on something KidSport is very proud of \u2014 their generous scholarship program, which is funded by donations and the U Meet the Athlete program. KidSport is committed to making the program available to families that want their child to experience all they have to offer. I truly got a sense of the passion for their programs and their sincere desire to achieve their goals, which include providing the skills for lifelong activity in a safe environment. KidSport is run through the U-M School of Kinesiology and even provides a classroom experience for camp instructors to inspire the one hundred plus kids that go through the program each week as they hone their skills. How is this done exactly? For over twenty years KidSport has been focusing on human movement through a very organized and well-rounded program that teaches athletic skills in a less competitive environment. Experts in children's physical education \u2014 many of whom are KidSport alums themselves \u2014 guide children through activities that foster sport specific skills, team building, social skills, etiquette, and good sportsmanship. This loyalty, I feel, is testimony to their desire to continue the traditions, and also to improve and evolve the camp. The week-long camps are divided into two groups. The morning session, for kids ages 4-15, focuses on all sports, both team and individual, and is more an intro to athletics. The afternoon session is more sport specific and spans ages 8-15, covering a variety of sports, including soccer, baseball/softball, football, golf, cheerleading, team handball, tennis, and disc golf among others. There are also two other programs, Outdoor Adventures and Camp Explorations, which can complement a child's involvement in the half-day program. Visits to U-M's Museum of Natural History and other activities can be combined to create a full day of physical activity and learning. Rest assured, your child will go home tired!

This is a man who is passionate about what he has to offer and what he gets in return as a result. He stated that Michigan summers are short enough that, although he wanted to foster kids' creativity in the technology arena, he also didn't want them locked inside. Rocks and Robots was born. Dr. Albercook started with eight kids in his camp and now it has grown to more than 120. Rocks and Robots is in its eleventh year and is staffed by owners George Albercook, Ph.D., and Katie Tilton, as well as a team of enthusiastic teachers with experience in educating youth from the elementary through grad levels. The class size is small, with eight to twelve students per teacher for a true one-on-one experience. The \"rocks\" portion of the camp is based on challenging outdoor activities like rock climbing. George acknowledges that many of the children drawn to this camp may be uncertain of themselves in the physical activity realm and feel this activity is out of their comfort zone. He has therefore devised a gentle and supportive way to get these kids to at least try and says he is 99.9 percent successful at doing this. The kids are excited and proud of themselves as a result. Dr. Albercook told me that, believe it or not, there are some people that don't know what LEGO Robotics are! Myself being one of them, I was surprised and intrigued to learn that LEGOs are not just the little interlocking blocks of our youths. They can be used to build animated robots. Campers at Rocks and Robots develop higher level thinking skills by building and computer programming LEGO models to move and interact. There are also opportunities for campers to experiment with their own designs. Let's be honest, robots are cool and are finally coming into their own. In addition to that, the do-it-yourself movement plays a major role here and there is nothing more satisfying than taking something you imagine and making it happen. We are hardwired to respond to movement, and movement happens with these robots at the hands of the children. There are multiple camp choices from June 18-August 24 for children ages 6-15. The choices range from Robotics and Engineering, Robot Sumo and Rock Climbing, and Building Your Own Flying Robot. I think it is clear that whether it's the rocks or robots portion of camp, both are hinged on the premise of movement. Dr. Albercook feels that there is something so primal about making things move and even more so to making things smart. It's a feeling that drives him to continue this work. He was beaming (well, I pictured him to be beaming through the phone) while telling me of his teaching style and working with the 120 plus kids each summer. He relishes the moments when they \"get it\" and figure it out or make it move. I could just picture their excitement and their facial expressions, and how they will never forget that moment, and neither will he.

The word Vipassana means clear seeing. Over the decades, I have become so grateful for this training to be awake, noticing the moments of life with a compassionate heart. It is not a fix-it program but a practice of radical self-acceptance. Here is a path that requires no belief system. I have learned so much from my own direct experience. Allow me to outline the practice for you, as I understand it. Generally speaking, there are two types of meditation techniques: concentration, which holds the mind to a primary object as focus, and insight, which allows the mind to be aware of all the experiences that ask for attention. CONCENTRATION Concentration is a practice of bringing the mind's attention repeatedly back to a single focus. This focus can be a mantra, a flame, or the breath. Many choose to watch the breath. We begin with finding a comfortable seated position on a cushion or chair to support us in our practice. Closing the eyes, relaxing, and feeling the body's sensations, we start concentration practice. You can find the breath at the tip of your nose, on your upper lip, or in the rise and fall of your chest. You can even create a word in the mind to help notice the breath, such as \"in\" or \"out,\" \"short\" or \"long.\" With practice, these words are not used; you simply know the nature of the moment without a verbal noting. You will notice the spaces between exhaling and inhaling. You breathe naturally and simply look at the breath, resting in the breath. This is different from thinking about the breath. There is no need to do anything special with the breath. Just let it be. Practicing in this way, you will discover the witnessing capability of the mind. In concentration practice, no matter what sound, thought, or body sensation may distract the mind, you notice it and then gently return to rest in the breath. My experience is that the concentration practice develops a focused mind and leads to deep states of calm. Concentration is used to stabilize the mind and lay the ground for insight practice. INSIGHT Insight is a meditation practice that takes us to a place of knowing truth by being awake in the moment, aware of what is. We take time to center the mind within the breath as primary object. The mind quiets but stays alert. Relaxation deepens as time goes on. This simple, yet keen, observation of the breath takes the meditator through the interface between body and mind. Physiologically speaking, the prac-titioner moves from the everyday mind of the sympathetic (fight or flight) nervous system to the relaxed mind of the parasympathetic (flow) nervous system. Concentration grows as sittings continue. A comfortable depth of stillness allows the transition to insight practice. The mind then follows each arising \u2014 sound, breath, an itch, breath, thought, memory, breath, a plan, itch again, et cetera \u2014 with no particular disturbance. You sit with a choiceless awareness or undirected mindfulness; no control, simply being with each arising experience without being hooked into personal story or emotional reactivity. You learn to watch each object arise and create no comment or judgment or decision in response. If lost in a line of thoughts, there will finally be an awareness of \"lost.\" Just note the experi - ence where you feel it, in the body or the mind. Is there any tension around the thoughts? Are they pleasant or unpleasant? As \"lost\" dissolves, you move back to the breath or other primary object and then again into choiceless awareness. Eventually, the practice becomes a lifestyle of awareness, taking mindfulness off the cushion and into daily life. We gain the steadiness to simply be with experi-ences, pleasant and unpleasant, with an open heart to ourselves and to others. BENEFITS Even more important than the well-known benefit of stress reduction is the wonderful gift of seeing the truth of how things are. We come to appreciate how changeable life is, how unsatisfactory in large and small ways, and how often it is out of our control. Realizing these experiences of impermanence, unsatisfactori-ness, and selflessness as we meditate is key to receiving the major benefits of the practice. Clear seeing brings a freedom from the pain of the ups and downs of life. Whatever happens \u2014 whether a mosquito bite or the death of a loved one \u2014 is simply the result of the conditions of life. Our emotional life continues to be lively, but there grows in us a calm abiding or equanimity. We do not add to the trials of life with unnecessary resistance. We don't take life's events so personally. Many people feel they can never meditate because their minds are too active. But thoughts are the raw material of the practice. Watching thoughts as they arise and the feelings they provoke, seeing them all as simply objects in the mind, allows for profound insights. Our thoughts usually focus on the conditions of our life: memories of our experiences or plans for future activities. Each time we meditate, we begin to notice that our thoughts and feelings are somewhat different as the activities and experiences of our life shift and change. Obviously, our thoughts and feelings are impermanent, and, therefore, we neither have to believe, be hurt by, nor act on our many thoughts and feelings. As we meditate, it slowly dawns on us that, along with all the changing phenomena we observe, there is a quiet part of us watching it all. This peaceful part, seemingly unchanging and ever present, can always be tapped. It's potentially in every one of us \u2014 old or young, well or sick, even mentally ill. The Buddhists tell us that this is our true nature. We are one with all others and connected to Mystery, the ultimate realities of the universe. We are not what the world sees \u2014 our job description, our looks, or any particular talent. Our truest identity is this peaceful core. Maybe you think that awareness practice would lead meditators to just watch life with detachment. Actually, we engage even more fully in life, but from a place of clarity, of responding not just reacting. We can live in the mundane world, never forgetting the ultimate reality that we are one with all beings. Our hearts open and we become able to gracefully share our peace, love, and light.

In 1996, Regina and Mounir Elkhatib's son, Mark, age 20, died in a car acci-dent. Like so many families, they expe-rienced the agony of losing their child and the insecurity of how they would make it from one day to the next. To help themselves and other families, they founded FOCUS (Families and Children United in Spirit), a bereavement support group in Northern Ohio. As they put it, it's a club no one wants to belong to, but it allows for bonds that transform lives and transform grief. Five years after Mark's death, Regina read about another teenager in the area, Nick Christensen, who had recently died in a car crash, and she had an intuition that she would soon be meet-ing his mother. When Angela Chris-tensen showed up for the FOCUS group, from the moment they met, Regina and Angela knew they were kindred souls and that their sons had brought them together. Losing their sons had thrust them into a deeper spiritual awakening. Bond-ing with other bereaved families had transformed them. They felt there was a greater need to inspire families after the loss of a loved one and to help others gain understanding of the bereaved. Their message would be simple: Your loved one is clos-er to you in spirit than you can ever imagine. Together they began to gather personal stories from other members of their group and compiled them into a book. Below are excerpts from this powerful collection: That New Year's Eve in 1998 was the day our lives changed forever. On one hand, it seems so long ago and on the other it is like yesterday. One moment you have a wonderful life, and the next a part of you is missing. It takes a lot of energy to pretend that everything is okay. You try to carry on a reasonably intelli-gent conversation while part of you is still screaming on the inside that your son is gone. Someone please say his name. Tell me you remember him. But very few have the courage to say what you are dying to hear. They say, \"How are you?\" and you reply, \"I'm okay.\" You realize that you, too, have lost the ability to say what you want to. So these meaningless little conversations take place. As you walk on you think, \"Oh, I wanted to let her know how much I miss my son, how hard it is to get up in the morning, how hard it is to go into the grocery store and see his favorite foods, watch TV , and see shows he liked and yet I say I'm okay.\" We talk uncomfortably and she walks on think-ing, \"I wish I would have said some-thing. I didn't want to make her cry, she looks so sad. Will it ever get better for her?\" It was bitter cold that night. A storm was forming. We had to find him. I stayed at home with the grandchildren while everyone searched. I tried to be calm, kept the coffee going, tried not to scare the grandkids. Friends and family drove trucks, rode on snowmobiles, and some even walked. Cold, cold, cold. I can't stand the cold to this day. Then it happened. Someone came to the door and said they found him. I went, but I can't remember who with. Someone stayed with the grandchildren, I don't know who. I just remember all of the flashing lights and all of the sad faces as I got out of the car...or was it a truck...and there was Bill, my husband. \"He's gone, he's gone.\" We held each other and I could hear myself saying, \"No, no, no!\"~I lay awake at night thinking of Billy. Can he see me? Does he know how much I miss him? I know that his loss will always be with me. I will never be able to make it go away. I heard once that I would grieve two to three minutes at a time for the rest of my life. I know that it is okay to grieve and it is also okay not to grieve. It is okay to be in the moment with your family and friends. It is okay to be happy, even if it's only for a moment. I had a difficult time thinking at the beginning of this journey. I just tried to breathe. I tried to hang on to the thought that I was okay. I hung on for the few moments when I would feel okay and then I would slip back into the grief that surrounded me. Now, I have come full circle. I have more good days than bad. Now, I am able to embrace the grief when it comes. I know that it lasts a few moments and then I will feel my angels around me and I will have peace again. Over the years, I have grown so much. I have learned to watch for the blessings. I have learned to forgive those who hurt us. I have learned that no matter what happens, it isn't as bad as losing Billy. I would like to share one of Billy's messages with you. He said, \"Dying is like taking off an old coat and stepping into glory. If you could see what I see, you would never wish me An Excerpt from Regina Elkhatib and Angela Christensen's Collection, Families of Children United in Spirit ~ Spiritual Journeys of Families After the Loss of a Loved One One moment you have a wonderful life, and the next a part of you is missing. We will never know what kind of grown man, husband, and father he would have been. Would all of our love, guidance, and hard work as parents have paid off?Regina Elkhatib and Angela Christensen are Northern Ohio mothers who have lost their teenage sons, and published a book of essays on grief, longing and spiritual growth.The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 88 back.\" Most of all, I have learned that Billy's angels were with him when he passed. He did not go alone. They carried him in their loving arms up to heaven for they were sent from God Himself to bring Billy home. Even though I firmly believe Nick is closer to me in spirit than I can ever imagine, I miss his physical presence. I often won-der what he would be doing today. What would he look like now? What would he be doing with his life? I try to picture his face, but the details are getting foggy with time. Many of his friends are married and have children. Two babies have been named after him. It hurts to know we will never experience Nick's own children. We will never know what kind of grown man, husband, and father he would have been. Would all of our love, guidance, and hard work as parents have paid off? Every morning, I take a walk with our dogs. This is my time to pray, talk to Nick, and speak to my angels and spirit guides. I ask for guidance and inspiration. I ask for help in my daily life and in the lives of friends and family. I also give thanks for all my blessings. I look back at my life and realize how far I've come. Many days are still very difficult, but I make a conscious effort to think positive. I have learned to let go and forgive. As I look back, my life's journey has been divided into two distinct parts. There was my naive life before Nick passed and my profound life after. In my early grief, I wanted my old life back. It would take me years to realize that would never happen. That person, that life is gone forever. I have grown lifetimes in eight short years. I also know I still have so much to learn. I believe Mark, Nick, Eric, Amanda, and I entered into this lifetime with the agreement that Nick would pass at a young age. This was his gift to us for our spiritual growth. I used to worry how I could live another 44 years with the pain of this loss. Now I look forward to old age with Mark and sharing my life with Eric and Amanda and, hopefully, their families someday. I take one day at a time, knowing my earth-ly life will be over in the blink of an eye. I focus on helping others through my experience. I want to be the best person I can be until I cross over to the next world. I have absolutely no fear and look forward to my own death when that time comes. I know Nick will be the first to greet me on the other side. I cannot wait for our reunion. My hope is for Nick to say, \"I'm proud of you, Mom.\" Angela Christensen is the owner of Angela' s Angels and Antiques, a gift shop that specializes in comfort gifts during times of loss and healing (5774 Main Street Sylvania, Ohio 43560; 419-824-4079).

Here to stay. By Gloria Zimet Photo by Sarah Neeley My journey into the world of holistic health began over 20 years ago, when I turned to reflexology to help alleviate my four-year-old son's worsening symp-toms of asthma. Sitting in on his sessions, I was introduced to reflexology' s premise that our feet mirror the health of our bodies; that each organ, gland, and muscle has a well-defined zone on the foot that can be massaged to help it function more optimally. I was impressed that a technique I had never heard of in my health science classes could ease my son's breathing and reduce his need for medication. His progress inspired me to become certified in reflexology and set aside my degree in medical technology in favor of a career in therapeutic foot massage! Several years later, as a practicing reflexologist, I began to feel subtle energy sensations as I was massaging my clients' feet. If I stopped moving my fingers and stayed with the energy pulsations until they subsided, the tension in the area where I was focusing would release, often accompanied by a change in the corresponding area of the body. I coined the term reflexolo-chi to describe this unique style of working with the clients' energy flow (chi) while simultaneously massaging their feet. Be - sides being gentler and more relaxing, the results are more immediate and long lasting with reflexolo-chi than with traditional reflexology. Despite these benefits, I was still perplexed as to why a client' s physical ten - sion or pain would typically improve significantly following a treatment, only to eventually return days or weeks later. Was there a way to tweak the work so the results would be permanent, or at least longer lasting? A breakthrough came seven years ago when I was introduced to the important and often overlooked role that subconscious beliefs play in our lives. We typically enter adulthood thinking we are making our own conscious choices about life, often unaware how much of our parents' \u2014 and society's \u2014 fears, inhibitions, prejudices, assumptions, and values we have unknowingly taken on from child-hood, and how much they still reside in our subconscious minds. Even when we consciously aspire to do things differently from our parents, those deeply ingrained, dysfunctional, subconscious beliefs continue to create the same problematic scenarios, until they are accessed and corrected. They impact our self-esteem, our outlook on life, the quality of our relationships, our ideas about success and what is possible to achieve, and \u2014 perhaps most surprisingly \u2014 our physical health. When repeated attempts to make significant changes in our emotional or physical health are unsuccessful, it's usually a sign that a limiting, subconscious belief is blocking our awareness and ability to do things differently. This knowledge helped me understand that these hidden beliefs were frequently the source of the emotional and psychological stressors my clients were facing in their everyday lives.I also realized that these beliefs were clearly linked with the physical tension the clients were complaining about in their bodies. Their stress was literally embody-ing in specific and predictable organs, glands, or muscles, and was reflected in the corresponding areas of their feet. It was no surprise, then, that without getting at the emotional root of their physical discomfort, the relief my clients experienced follow-ing a reflexolo-chi session would be short-lived. After five years of working with fellow reflexologist Greg Knollmeyer , we have de- veloped an effective way to alleviate both the physical and emotional components of dis-ease in a single session. We have currently identified 18 core subconscious beliefs that compromise our ability to live with complete freedom, freely and authentically. Each limiting belief has a specific place in the body and feet where tension accumu - lates as a result of holding the belief, which eventually causes pain and dis-ease. Using a technique similar to muscle testing, the underlying subconscious belief can be identified within a few minutes. Once the belief is brought to the client' s conscious awareness, it can be readily dismantled and rewritten using a combination of visual, auditory, kinesthetic, neurologic, and energetic inputs that take place while the reflex - ologist works with the corresponding areas of the individual's feet, where the tension is trapped. Combining Subconscious Belief Attunements with Reflexolo-Chi ~ How Erasing Negative Thoughts and Trapped Tension Creates Lasting Mind-Body Results When repeated attempts to make significant changes in our emotional or physical health are unsuccessful, it's usually a sign that a limiting, subconscious belief is blocking our awareness and ability to do things differently. \"Each limiting belief has a specific place in the body and feet where tension accumulates as a result of holding the belief, which eventually causes pain and dis-ease.\" Reflexologist Gloria Zimet Yoga (continued) Yoga Postures with Optional Lunch with Diana Kimball and Dorothy Ann Coyne of Deep Spring Wednesdays: 10:30-Noon with optional lunch, Noon-1:30 All are welcome!

They commonly feel as if a weight has been lifted off their bodies, leaving them lighter, more peaceful, and optimistic. The transition from the old, dysfunctional belief to a new and healthy belief circuitry happens so quickly that little, if any, resistance is encountered.People are relieved to understand why, despite all their efforts and good intentions, they were unable to break the vicious cycle themselves: the limiting subconscious belief had automatically and uncontrollably precipitated their undesirable habits, making positive change erratic and elusive. Subtle, yet profound changes in clients' behaviors are set into motion after the session. Hurtful comments or behaviors that would have predictably triggered them in the past no longer do so. The difficult people or circumstances in their lives don't change, but their responses do. They happily report that they are able to make different choices and are less likely to be drawn into old patterns and dramas. This recent testimonial from a woman who sought relief from migraines illustrates how profoundly transformational the combination of reflexolo-chi and subcon - scious belief attunements can be: \"It is as if I have been carrying around a bag of cement with a thick, padlocked chain wrapped around it. You had the key and I opened the bag and let it spill out. I was so closed...my life is put together now in a way I never dreamed possible. Where there was so much sorrow and disdain for life, I now have hope and the understanding of what hope means and can bring to one's life. You have touched everyone in my family.\" Rather than focusing solely on physical symptoms or psychological issues, this approach recognizes the interplay of the two and is able to address both simulta-neously. For example, people who have repeated urinary tract symptoms tend to bottle up their anger, usually because it seems impossible to resolve certain situ-ations without becoming enraged, withdrawing, or sacrificing an important part of themselves to stay in a relationship. The frustration they feel in this ongoing lose-lose situation escalates to the point where they become \"pissed off.\" That slang expression accurately describes what happens to these folks. Their an- ger becomes embodied as a new layer of tension in the bladder every time they are drawn into the provocative circumstance. It impairs bladder function and makes them susceptible to infection, incontinence, frequent urges to urinate, or other urinary tract disorders. Once the new urinary tract belief paradigm is in place, clients immediately see how they unknowingly played a role in perpetuating the dysfunctional dynamic, and are receptive to creating personalized belief statements to repair and replace the limiting ones. This interactive process acts like Drano to rapidly flush out ten - sion that has clogged the kidney and bladder zones of the feet (which then frees the tension in those actual organs). Continuing to repeat the subconscious belief attunement statements afterwards prevents the build-up of further tension in the physical area. Equally important, clients become confident in advocating for their own needs in the relationship without worrying about provoking the old, dysfunctional patterns. Combining reflexolo-chi with subconscious belief attunements in a supportive and compassionate setting enables these transformative mind-body-spirit changes to seamlessly occur in a single session, for people of all ages and all walks of life.

By Mark Rojek In the 1940s Dr. Edward Howell, the pioneer of enzyme therapy, explained how chronic degenerative disease was the result of enzyme \"starvation.\" He is famous for his observation that \"Without enzymes, life itself could not exist.\" At that time, only a handful of physicians knew what enzymes were. It wasn't until the 1980s that Dr. Howard F. Loomis, Jr., put enzymes in the spotlight of clinical nutrition. Today, Dr. Loomis is considered the leading authority in enzyme therapy. He cre- ated a medically sound system for evaluating enzyme deficiencies associated with disease. In 1985, I begin a mentorship with Dr. Loomis, leading to mastering an understanding of enzymes' role in health and disease. My knowledge gained over the years has helped hundreds of clients, as well as my son, Phoenix. Phoenix was admitted to the ER three days after his birth, due to his inability to nurse. This caused him to experience dangerously low blood sugar, which was not properly addressed by an inexperienced doctor. As a result, my son suffered seizures that caused severe brain damage. The tragedy that befell him has given me deeper insight into the relationship between the digestive tract (gut) and the brain. This relationship is known as the \"gut-brain axis,\" and the gut is called the \"sec- ond brain.\" How often have you noticed a \"funny feeling\" in your abdomen? That is your second brain \"talking\" and is often related to a stressful situation. \"Gut\" feelings are self-protective measures our bodies rely on. The digestive tract is also one of the main sites of our immune system, another important reason to keep it healthy. Loomis was the first to explain that body stress comes in three forms: emotional, structural, and dietary. We are conscious of emotional stress because of its associat-ed emotions: anger, fear, or depression. Structural stress is discomfort and difficulty in walking, standing, or any activity requiring movement. The third type of stress is less obvious to notice. Awareness of dietary stress occurs only when we feel physical pain. Regardless of which source, stress changes our body chemistry, producing elevated hormone levels that, when left unchecked, lead to all sorts of chronic health problems. Everyone has some dietary stress from carbohydrates, fats, and protein. Imagine digestion as a process within your body akin to taking something the size of your house and splitting it down to the size of a grain of sand. In digestion, protein is broken down into peptides and amino acids, fats into essential fatty acids, and carbohydrates into complex and simple sugars. When digestion does not occur properly, you have objects the size of your sofa, re- frigerator, or television set trying to pass through your body. In other words, you do not have the proper micro-sized food nutrients that nourish cells, but larger macro-molecules incapable of feeding the cells, causing stress in tissues and organs.In the early 1980s, the husband-and-wife team of Richard and Judith Wurtman from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology examined how food affects the brain and behavior. They divided elderly people at a senior retirement center into two groups based on their behavior. One group was always anxious and unable to relax. They could not sit still and were constantly moving. The other group was the \"couch potatoes.\" They had little interest in getting up and about, with a very slow reaction time (as measured by a brake time test). When fed carbohydrates (without fat or protein), the seniors who were anxious became calm and able to sit without wandering off. However, if fat or protein was present in their diet, there was no change in their anxiety level. Feeding the seniors who sat all day only protein (without carbohydrates and fats) got them up and moving about. They became interested in doing more activities and their brake test time was faster. But when these seniors were fed protein with fats or carbohydrates, they did not achieve the same results. Amazingly, these changes in both groups occurred in only 30 minutes after being fed! The explanation for the radical change in the anxious group is that eating carbohy- drates without protein or fats increases serotonin levels. Serotonin is a neurotrans-mitter responsible for feelings of happiness, and which also regulates attention, behavior, and body temperature. Serotonin is converted from the amino-acid tryptophan, which is found in food. However, tryptophan is not very abundant in food, especially in protein. It turns out that 90 percent of all serotonin is produced in the digestive tract, not the brain! The Wurtmans observed that carbohydrates increase the production of serotonin in the digestive tract, thus affecting behavior. People with ADD/ADHD, autistic spectrum disorder, and those with depression tend to crave mostly carbohydrates. Unconsciously, they might be self-medicating by eating carbohydrates to raise their serotonin levels. The reason why protein worked so well on the sedentary group is that protein has high levels of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. During the digestive process, these are converted to dopamine and norepinephrine. Dopamine controls movement, emotional response, and the ability to experience pleasure and pain. Norepinephrine, like dopamine, plays a role in attention and focus. For people with ADD/ADHD, stimulant medications like Ritalin\u00ae, Concerta\u00ae, Dexedrine\u00ae, and Adderall are prescribed to increase levels of norepinephrine and dopamine. However, enhancing protein consumption and digestion achieves the same increased levels. The Wurtmans' study is an example of how food can be therapeutic.Digestion Therapy:The Relationship Between Food and Neurological Imbalances [There is a] relationship between the digestive tract (gut) and the brain...known as the \"gut-brain axis,\" and the gut is called the \"second brain.\"Imagine digestion as a process within your body akin to tak-ing something the size of your house and splitting it down to the size of a grain of sand...When digestion does not occur properly, you have objects the size of your sofa, refrigerator, or television set trying to pass through your body.

His son, Phoenix, is sitting next to him, and his son, Tenzin, is on the right. It's clear that people with neurological health issues have an \"out-of-balance\" brain, with digestive problems negatively impacting neurological functions. There are several possible courses of action to attempt a remedy: Pharmaceutical drugs are known to alter brain chemistry, but also have serious side effects. Simply increasing carbohydrates or protein may show modest improvements in neuro-logical conditions, but the results are temporary. Repairing and restoring healthy digestive functions is a safe and effective solution and should be the first priority in treatment. All raw, uncooked food contains enzymes to digest itself. But when cooked food is eaten, the body must use its own cellular enzymes to digest it. Robbing the body of cellular enzymes in this way leads to health problems, as Dr. Howell stated in the 1940s. Excessive consumption of any cooked or processed food leads to deficiencies of enzymes. But taking enzymes can help the body process food properly. For instance, in clinical studies, when patients with celiac disease (marked by gluten sensitivity) took enzymes prior to eating meals containing gluten, it prevented them from experiencing indigestion and pain afterward. Another example is food allergies, which are clinical symptoms of enzyme de- ficiencies. The enzyme deficiencies can then lead to neurological problems. For example, many children with autistic spectrum disorder and ADD/ADHD have gluten and dairy allergies. It is worth noting that the use of Ritalin to treat ADD/ADHD is often problematic. The drug merely attempts to temporarily mask the symptoms, which can often be better addressed by checking for, and correcting, enzyme deficiencies. It is also my belief that neurologists, when treating seizure disorders, are not paying enough attention to the gut-brain connection. Carefully calibrated nutritional and enzy-matic therapy can make a differ-ence in the successful treatment of various neurological conditions. Fortunately, what I've learned has helped my son, Phoenix, as well as benefitted others. Although it has been a long, arduous jour-ney, with many trials and errors, Phoenix is finally beginning to get relief from his seizures. Using a combination of enzymes, probi-otics, and dietary modifications (such as decreasing selected car-bohydrates and dramatically im-proving the mucosal lining in the digestive tract), he has gone from suffering several daily seizures to only having one or two very mild seizures that can be days or weeks apart. There is more to be done in replenishing my son's gut flora and healing his GI tract, but this change is promising. I also have been using the Gut and Psycholo-gy Syndrome (GAPS) diet, as de-veloped by Dr. Natasha Campbell- McBride. She has been instrumental in detailing the relationships between the gut and brain in ADD/ADHD and other neurological illnesses. Her work should be the first approach in all manners of neurological health issues, instead of drugs.In my health practice, I use Dr. Loomis' specialized 24-hour urinalysis as an inexpensive way to check for enzyme deficiencies created by dietary stressors. It uncovers the shortfalls of one's diet, revealing enzyme deficiencies to be corrected and which dietary modifications are necessary. It is a window into what the body must do to maintain its biochemical balance, no matter what the health condition is. This test allows me to tailor an individual's enzyme program based on scientifi - cally sound test results. It offers the best way to restore healthy neurological func-tion through the \"second brain\" \u2014 the gut.

The Earth is like a child that knows poems. ~Rainer Maria RilkeArtwork by Sara Van ZandtThe Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 110 The Crazy Wisdom Community Journal May - August 2012 Page 111 By Jim Stacey It is the worst of human behavior, it is the best of the human drama, it is the mixing pot of humanity, it is the cauldron of the human shadow, it is a catalyst for great invention, it is the cause of most human suffering. It is the human battle we've long known as \"competition,\" which has created grand luxury for the few and gross suffering for the masses. A world without competition, where everyone wins? Surely this would be dreaming the impossible dream and the quest for the unreachable sky. Or is it? WINNING IN SPORTSPerhaps the ugliest part of sports is seen in the intensity generated around winning. This is most graphically seen in the faces and gestures of the average college basketball coach on the sidelines during a game. There, every expression and its inherent intensity seems to be more about \"not losing\" than it is about winning. But what is winning, other than the experience of not losing? In the world of sports, to end the battle with a tie has been dubbed the \"kissing your sister\" effect. No one wants a tie, because that is not winning! It used to be said about a tie, \"at least we didn't lose.\" But a tie in sports leaves everyone without the ego's prize: \"We beat them!\" In the hollow emptiness of having neither a win nor a loss after the battle, the human ego invented overtime, the Sudden Death experience (why not Sudden Life?), the shoot-out, and whatever else would ensure a winner and a loser. Most would rather risk a loss in the fight for a win, than to tie and not know either. Why? WINNING VS. LOSING What does a win really mean? What does a loss really mean? What does the label \"winner\" really identify in a person or a team? Is not \"winner\" a mask that pushes compassion aside? Does a winner's self-focus replace empathy? Does the winner project their inner \"loser\" onto others? Are we not all winners and losers in different situations throughout our life experiences? We all know that losing can yield valuable insights and help us realize some important gifts. In that case, if I celebrate a loss because in it I found an important lesson, then is it really losing? Can anyone really win all the time? Yes, because, as we realize that, winning and losing are human inventions. We win every time we allow life experiences to take us to a place of higher consciousness. We can we must create a world where everyone wins, if this planet is to survive! The beauty of this kind of world is far more than a tie game. In the distortions of competition, whatever its form, no one wins: not the \"winner,\" not the \"loser,\" not even those who embrace the tie scenario. We must understand that a battle, as set up by some form of human greed, can never yield a winner only losers all! Everyone loses when someone is \"beaten\" or laughed at or dubbed as the \"loser.\" If I beat someone, does that act make me a winner? What have I lost in that process?FEAR OF LOSINGIn our highly competitive society, we have created a world where those who compete with others are, by a measure of their wealth, \"winners.\" But they are not necessarily winners at all. Homes, cars, yachts, portfolios, positions in life, and other forms of apparent success, are many times only masks for the fear of losing. What is included in the fear of losing? As the character Yoda from Star Wars said, \"The fear of losing is the path to the dark side.\" Does that turn \"winning\" into that \"dark side?\" Yes, if winning (really, the fear of losing) is our only goal. At the point of forcing someone else to lose, winning can be the greatest blindness that we can experience. We are blind in that place because we fail to \"see\" our brothers and sisters and their needs.When the \"one with the most toys\" is the winner, isn't it possible that, in their treasure hunt for \"things,\" they are losing out on what is vastly more important in life? We've been encased in a world of competitive behavior in which nations, religions, classes, and political parties are in fierce competition. But for what, really? What does winning mean, as we compete for jobs, driving space on the road, people to fill the pews, votes, sexual partners, and even food itself? Isn't all this just a picture of the ego at work? MEETING NEEDSWhat is it we are looking for?Every battle of the human drama is really about getting our needs met. To win is to get certain needs met. To lose is to be frustrated and fall short of that experience. We battle, love, criticize, share, create, destroy, work, play, avenge, laugh, cry, hope, plan, celebrate, and more all as a means to getting our inner needs met.What needs? That is the question we must be able to answer. Have you ever made a list of your needs, in order to understand what your quest in this life is about? All human needs are universal \u2014 we are one in our humanity and in our Divinity. Our needs are exactly the same needs as those of our fellow pilgrims on this journey we call \"life.\" And, while the needs of humanity are the same for each of us, they are not the same in any given moment. Every decision we make, and every action we take, are all about getting our needs met! Nothing we do is unrelated to this quest. While listing our needs, we must be aware that the \"wants\" of the ego are always in the mix. We all have needs related to our own self. Those needs include expression, challenge, love, creativity, integrity, purpose, touch, accomplishment, sexual connection, sustenance, self-worth, choice, and many more. Needs around relationships include appreciation, respect, community, forgiveness, inclusion, contributing to others' lives, empathy, love, mutual trust, sexuality, celebration, connection, sharing in grief, birthing a new self, presence, and more. We also have needs in the spiritual (not religious) arena, like harmony, tangible connection, intuition, knowing, celebrating love, expressing beauty, experiencing beauty, knowing peace within and without, order, tranquility, communion, creativity, and many more. Love is always a spiritual experience. When we choose love over competition, that energy opens our inner doors of compassion for others and their need. Love is always inclusion, not pushing others away. We all vibrate with the full list of human needs. We fill our lives with activities that help us to get them met in whatever way we can. And, most of the time we are unconscious of which need we are meeting by each action we take. Some people have done some incredibly horrendous acts to get their needs met. Yet in our humanity, all of us are all living to get our needs satisfied and no one is free of selfish acts in the process of meeting a need. We must come to understand this as deeply as possible and recognize the priorities that we have in any given moment as we experience this process. Not one of us is better than any other human! WHEN EVERYONE WINS In c ontrast, what are the benefits of everyone winning? What would that look like? Since most of us have never experienced this at a deep level, what have we been missing? We all seem to long for winning in one way or another, as we work hard to avoid what feels like losing. What would it be like to have others truly value us for who we are? What would be our experience if the human spirit-being was recognized as Divine, and all humans were honored as in the Sanskrit statement, \"Namaste\": \"The god/goddess in me honors the god/goddess in you\"? We risk losing this experience by focusing on our \"need\" to win at all costs. To create a world in which everyone wins is to build community in our midst, a community that includes everyone at the table. Community is diversity rather than exclusion. Community is cooperation rather than competition. It is where love replaces fear, compassion replaces false pride, and where service replaces battle. It is easy to write about this. It is much more difficult to create it and maintain it.EMBRACING THE DARK SIDEWe all have our shadow self or dark side. We each contain opposites that are \"good\" and \"bad\" sides of the same trait. We have been taught to project our dark side onto others, thereby pushing our shadow away. We may feel really good when we see our negative traits in others, instead of owning what we are and transforming that into becoming the best self we can be. Our greatest magnificence is hiding just behind our fear that we aren't good enough or our fear of admitting that we need to do shadow work. We've learned to deny our best self far too often, to fear our greatest strength too many times, to mistrust what we truly know, and to hide what the world needs in order to heal \u2014 he best possible me and the best possible you. We need each other's support to make it happen. This is where applause replaces criticism and celebration replaces condemnation. When others see our magnificence and support us in calling forth that light out of the shadows, we will become a new self. You help me grow! I help you grow! Yes! If I truly love you, I will call forth the best in you and support your new self with celebration. And, I will trust you to call forth the best in me too. Together, we can replace ignorance and shame with beauty and love. \"I see you!\" was the great insight from the movie, Avatar. We cannot see each other until we join together on the great adventure of community \u2014 getting our needs met in the aura of love and connection. Community happens when we shift from \"Me\" to \"We\"! As we pass through this world of illusions, may it become \"we, we, we\" all the way home. COMMUNITY Community, as the world where everyone wins, will only be created as we assist each other in meeting our human needs. What I see in you must first be resolved in me and/or celebrated in me, for our hearts to be one. Community is created by choosing empathy and compassionate service to others in this context. Community comes into reality by cooperating with one another, by working to see others get their needs met, by focusing on loving others, by asking what they need, by intuiting those needs when possible, and, with permission, assisting others in getting their needs met in healthy and constructive ways. In this process, we become spiritual midwives for each other in the birthing of a new self continuously. As we each give birth to a new self over and over again, we create celebration! Our Divinity is to be celebrated, for that is what we are. The greatest service on the planet today is to measurably support and love all those who have been disenfranchised by our society, whether because of religion, race, ethnicity, gender, view of the world, or any other factor that has resulted in separation. CHANGE STARTS HEREWe have the power to change our inner landscape from \"sinner\" to \"winner\" just by changing one letter. That change involves doing inner transformation work and birthing a new self continuously. The old religious \"sinner\" label just doesn't serve anyone.
