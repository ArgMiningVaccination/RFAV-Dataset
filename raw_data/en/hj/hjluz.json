The 46 NOSB has requested a full technical evaluation repor t for vaccines for aquaculture to support their 47 decision -making. 48 49 50 51 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 2 of 25 Characterization of Petitioned Substance 52 53 Composition of the Substance : 54 Vaccination against infectious disease has been practiced for many decades and prove s to be one of the 55 most cost efficient means of reducing animal suffering and economic loss due to bacterial and viral 56 infections (Horzinek et al., 1997). A vaccine contains or produces a substance (s) called an antigen (s) that 57 stimulate s an innate and/ or adaptive immune response in an aquatic organism against a particular 58 pathogen . The immune response enables protection from disease and resist ance to future infection. 59 Primitive aquatic species only have innate immune systems that respond non -specific ally to pathogens and 60 have limited memory of prior antigen exposure. More advanced vertebrate species possess both innate and 61 adaptive immune systems with an extensive memory of prior infections . 62 Fishes are the most primitive vertebrates possessing a developed im mune system including an adaptive 63 immune response . Physiologically, the fish adaptive immune response results in an expansion of a 64 population of antibody producing cells called B -lymphocytes . Antibodies produced by B-lymphocytes are 65 specialized proteins th at self-configure to specifically bind to a site(s) on the cognate antigen , and 66 subsequen tly process it to be neutralized and removed. The immune response , a complex process, also 67 stimulates immune functions and hematopoietic lymphoid and myeloid tissues playing roles in pathogen 68 removal and neutralization, homeostasis , maintaining a memory of the infection and restoring functions 69 lost during infection . The main lymphoid organs of fish are thymus, anterior (head) -kidney, spleen and 70 blood tissue. The ante rior-kidney is unique to fish. It contains a large population of lymphocytes and 71 actively produces antibodies. The anterior -kidney i s a major site of eryth roid, lymphoid and myeloid cell 72 production and antigen trapping (Deivasigamani, 2007 ). 73 Most of the vaccines approved for use by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for fish are 74 produced by conventional methods starting with natural pathogens grown in culture (van Oirschot, 1997) . 75 For inactivate d vaccines, inactivating agents, i.e. formaldehyde, -propriolactone and ethyleneimine are 76 used to reticulate pathogen proteins that interact with cellular receptors and block nucleic acid replication. 77 Disadvantages for killed vaccines are the potential fo r immunosuppressive passenger antigens, toxic 78 reactions caused by immune -enhancing adjuvants, reduced immunogenicity due to denaturation of 79 proteins and systemic reactions. 80 Modified live vaccines are prepared from one or more viruses, bacteria or parasite s of attenuated virulence 81 or natural low virulence for the target species. Pathogens are attenuated with heat, serial passage in cell 82 culture, culture under abnormal conditions or genetic manipulation (Desmettre and Martinod, 1997) . Of 83 conventionally prepa red vaccines, m odified live vaccines stimulate the best immune response . However, 84 hazards including residual virulence , virulence in immune -compromised vaccinates and reversion to 85 virulence due to natural genetic recombination must be monitored and sometim es make modified live 86 vaccines difficult to license . 87 A number of the known pathogens and parasites in aquaculture and availability of vaccines for them are 88 described in Table 1. Pathogen s causing these diseases and parasitic infections are frequently 89 immunoevasive or immunosuppressive : they are able to avoid or reduce the fish' s immune response and 90 proliferate. Thus in many cases , inoculation with conventional vaccines consisting of whole pathogens or 91 parasites, live or killed may not result in immuniz ation. In order to develop vaccines for all of the fish 92 diseases , veterinary immunologist s have begun to use biomolecular approaches to 1) identify specific 93 molecul es from pathogens capable of stimulating sterilizing immunity , 2) develop effective methods for 94 producing these antigens and 3) establish strategies for delivering antigenic vaccines in the absence of 95 immunoev asive or immunosuppressive substances. Most often the immunizing principle is found in a 96 poly peptide that is strongly recognized by antibodies . Peptides or DNA encoding specific peptides have 97 been used in the development of recombinant vaccines: protein subunit vaccines , live recombinant vaccines 98 and DNA vaccines. 99 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock ___________________________________ January 24, 2014 Page 3 of 25 Table 1 Known Fish Diseases1 Disease Causative agent Major affected fish species Country/region Commercially vaccine(s) Bacterial Diseases Enteric redmouth (ERM) Yersinia ruckeri Salmonids, primarily rainbow trout North America, Europe, South, America yes Vibriosis - Vibriosis Vibrio anguillarum, sea bass, bream, amberjack, yellowtail Japan, North, America yes - Hitra disease V. salmonicida Atlantic salmon Bacterial kidney disease Renibacterium salmoninarum Salmonids North America, Europe, Japan, Chile yes yes Enteric septicemia Edwardsiella ictaluri E. tarda Catfish Catfish, Eel, hirame Southeastern United S tates, Canada Asia Asia Japan yes no no no Motile aeromonid septicemia Aeromonas hydrophila, A. caviae, A.

CVB has recently begun updated its naming conven tion for vaccines containing 103 recombinant organisms (Table 2APHIS, 2013b). Historically, naming of recombinant vaccines has been 104 variable and names previously assigned to vaccines containing recombinant organism may not be accurate. 105 106 Table 2 Current APHI S CVB guidance for true names for vaccines containing recombinant organisms1 Antigen/Gene Expression System Naming Convention -antigen expressed in a recombinant system -subunit vaccine -gene deleted or inserted into an organism producing a recombinant seed -the recombinant is named the same as the conventional product. -a foreign gene is inserted into an expression vector and a) the final product contains both the vector and the expressed foreign protein, and b) there is a label claim for the vector as well as the insert protein -true name includes the identity of the vector; the inserted genes are reflected in the true name, and the identity of the vector appears as a modifier - a foreign gene is inserted into an expr ession vector and a) the final product contains both the vector and the expressed foreign protein but efficacy against disease caused by the vector has not been established -the identity of the vector is not currently included in main part of the true name . -the organism has had essential genes deleted and the foreign inserts are necessary for replication competence -chimera -the organism that receives the foreign inserts is replication competent without the inserts -vector 1The true name is based on the entities for which there is a biological claim. 107 Source or Origin of the Substance: 108 109 The first studies on the immune response of fish to Aeromonas salmonicida , the causative agent of 110 furunculosis were published in the mid 1930s and passed unnoticed due t o the rise at that time in interest 111 and subsequent use of antimicrobial compounds, such as antibiotics, nitrofurans, sulfa compounds, calomel 112 and others. Immediately following World War II, husbandry served as the primary means of disease 113 control in aquacu lture. When this failed, the main recourse was chemical therapy (Evelyn, 1997). 114 Aquaculture subsequently emerged as a revolution in agriculture of global importance (Duarte et al., 2007). 115 About 430 (97%) of the aquatic species presently in culture have been domesticated since the start of the 116 20th century, and an estimated 106 aquatic species have been domesticated over the past decade. This 117 growing aquaculture industry brought both the specter of profit limiting disease and a renewed interest in 118 vaccina tion (Sherwood, 1993). Over time the disadvantages of using chemical therapy became apparent. 119 These were high cost, short term protection, high cost of getting new drugs approved by the USDA, 120 requirements for adequate drug clearance before treated fish cou ld be marketed and the development of 121 drug resistance (Evelyn, 1997). The development of the first commercial fish vaccines for enteric red mouth 122 disease (ERMRoss et al., 1966) and furunculosis (Harrell et al., 1 976) occurred in late 1960s and 1970s. 123 Since then, billions of fish have been vaccinated against a number of economically important pathogens. 124 125 Properties of the Substance: 126 127 Vaccination is useful for a number of reasons, e.g. preventing or significantly reducing clinical signs and 128 chronic condit ions in the host during and after pathogenic infection; preventing viral or bacterial shedding 129 by the host; preventing the spread of virus by secondary direct infection of another host or indirect 130 transmission through a carrier and preventing epizootics. V accines properties vary depending on the 131 pathogen for which it has bee n made and the type of vaccine . 132 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 7 of 25 Vaccines are best administered as early as possible in the life cycle of fish in order to protect them through 133 the most vulnerable stages of development. Four methods are used for vaccinating fish : injection, 134 immersion, spray and oral. Each has its advantages and disadvantages (Table 3). Injecting vaccin e on a 135 commercial scale is very labor intensive, requiring crews of people working continuously to immun ize fish. 136 The direct or dip immersion method is the most widely used means of immunizing fish. It is very 137 economical on smaller fish (<l0 -15 g), though stressful. Fish are exposed for a minimum of 20 seconds to 138 well -aerated diluted suspensions of the vacci ne and returned to holding tanks, etc., where they are held 139 long enough to develop adequate levels of protective immunity. Spray vaccination adequately immunizes 140 fish as long as they are exposed for at least two seconds. Unfortunately fish must be handled, potentially 141 causing physical damage and stress. Many modifications of the spray method exist. Another route of 142 immunization is the oral route . Fish are fed in activated bacterial suspens ions in the form of a paste or liquid 143 suspension either coated onto or milled into feed (Newman, 1993) . 144 145 Table 3. Comparison of various routes of vaccine administration* Route of Immunization Fish Weight Advantages Disadvantages Injection Typically 0.1-0.5 ml intraperitoneally (IP), intramuscularly (IM), or subcutaneously (SC) >15 g Highest levels of protection; very economical for larger fish; allows for ready administration of adjuvants and chemotherapeutants; semiautomated injection technology exi sts Very labor intensive; fish must be individually handled resulting in stress; hazardous to persons doing injecting Immersion Dip-l:lO-1:lOO dilution for s Bath -l:lOO -1:lOOO s-30 min 1-5 g High levels of protection; not as stressful as injection; most widely used method; semiautomated technology exists; allows in situ immunization in hatchery troughs, holding tanks, transport vessels, and net pens Fish must be handled; weight per unit volume limitations make it uneconomical for larger fish; labor intensive; adjuvant delivery problematic Spray (shower) 1-5 g High levels of protection; 3 -10 times the poundage per unit volume of immersion; semiautomated technology exists Fish must be handled; l abor intensive; specialized machinery required Oral (by feed or per OS) 1-5 g No handling of fish required; moderate, variable levels of protection; no handling of vaccine or machinery is required Levels of protection variable and are not as great as that provided by other methods; probably best as a secondary or boost vaccination *Newman, 1993 , Kibenge et al., 2012 146 There are two broad groups of conventional vaccine s: inactivated and modified live. Inactivated vaccines 147 contain microorganisms and viruses rendered non-infectious by inactivation. Viruses do not fit the classical 148 growth, reproduction, irritab ility, metabolism (GRIM) definition for an organism, but are important in 149 disease and vaccinology. When the inactivated microorganism is bacteria l, the resulting vaccine is called a 150 bacterin . Inactivated vaccines pro duced from the supernatant of a bacterial culture or from an inactivated 151 toxin are called toxoids . Formal dehyde is the most widely used agent for inactivating viral, bacterial and 152 parasitic pathogens . It not only kill s the microorganism, but denature s and preserve s its proteins. 153 Formaldehyde is removed during the inactivation process once the pathogen is inactivated . Effective use of 154 inactivated vaccine s require s the addition of adjuvant s that non-specificall y enhance the innate immune 155 response to a given antigen boost ing protective immunity (van Oirschot, 1997) . Adjuvants are produced 156 from a wide array of substances including oil water emulsions, aluminum containing compounds and 157 various chaperoning proteins such as the 70 kilodalton heat shock protein. A major drawback for adjuvant 158 use is the production of a site specific reaction or toxicity: the potential of some adjuvant s to cause a lesion 159 at the s ite of injection. Injection site reactions can render meat unsuitable for consumption reducing its 160 value. Modified l ive vaccines are produced in a number of ways. Cl assically, modified live vaccines for 161 viruses, bacteria and parasites are produced by growing the organisms in vitro or in an alternate host 162 through many generations, and selecting for naturally occurring mutants that no longer cause disease, but 163 are still replicative. Recently, live bacterial vaccines have been developed by selecting for a specific drug 164 resistant over a number of passages and assessing for residual virulence (Pridgeon et al., 2013). Advantages 165 include delivery by a number of routes, good p resentation of antigens, since the organism is growing in the 166 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 8 of 25 host, and longer acting as a result of cellular potentiation of the immune response (Horzinek et al, 1997). 167 Live vaccines may still be immunosuppressive. Furthermore, because the attenuation mut ations in some 168 conventional live vaccine are produced at random and not determined at the molecular level, it is 169 impossible to predict where they will occur and under what circumstance the may revert to virulence. 170 Vaccines rendered avirulent with a single point mutation can revert to virulence in one passage. 171 Biomolecular methods such as restriction enzyme mapping, the polymeras e chain reaction (PCR), DNA 172 sequencing and microarray analysis have facilitated antigen discovery, construction of n ovel candidate 173 vaccines and assessments of vaccine efficacy, mode of action and host response (Kurath, 2008). These 174 methods also provide strategies to identify alter and delete the virulence genes of various pathogens. For 175 example in bacteria deleting gene s involved in adhesion, toxin production or any one of the physiologically 176 important biosynthetic pathways can alter the organism's ability to cause disease. Viral attenuation through 177 deletion of virulence genes provide s opportunities to insert heterologou s genes for other pathogens to 178 convert the once virulent virus to a functional live vaccine (Babiuk, 1997c). Biologics produced with 179 biomolecular methods include subunit and monoclonal antibody vaccines, recombinant modified live 180 vaccines, and DNA vaccine s. An exemption under section 205.105 allows vaccines from excluded methods 181 to be considered for addition to the National List. 182 Subunit vaccines consist ing of proteins and glycoproteins capable of inducing a protective immune 183 response are potentially more economical and safer than conventional killed or live vaccines . Subunit 184 vaccines lack immune -interfering or immunoevasive substances that can be present in whole organism 185 vaccines and are not likely to revert to virulence . They are also better suited for multicomponent 186 vaccination, and provide a way to differentiate vaccinates from infected fish. Their p roduction is facilitated 187 by identifying genes encoding the protein or glycoprotein of interest and expressing these genes in an 188 appropriate expression syst em or using synthetic peptide technology (Babiuk, 1997 a). Semi -synthetic and 189 synthetic glycoconjugate vaccines have been used in other organisms for protection against bacteria. These 190 may one day offer a non -excluded vaccine for organic aquaculture ( Consta ntino et al, 2011) 191 Early vaccine research showed the potential of using heterologous viruses to ind uce immunity against a 192 pathogen with a non-virulent organism of distinct origin . Historic work by Edwa rd Jenner and Louis 193 Pasteur demonstrated the immunization potential of V accinia virus for smallpox (Babiuk, 1997b). Bacterin 194 immunization Nile Tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus is 195 complicated by immunoevasion resulting from the emergence of new bacter ial serotypes. Shoemaker et al. 196 have shown that it is possible to immunize against S. iniae with a heterologous bacterin (2010). Bacterial 197 kidney disease in salmonids is caused by the bacteri um, Renibacterium salmoninarum containing 198 the non -virulent bacterium, Arthrobacter davidanieli is used as a live vaccine for this disease, because the 199 vaccine bacteria and the pathogen share a conserved protein that serves to stimulate immunity against the 200 pathogen . 201 Antibodies, the firs t responder to antigens, can neutralize pathogen s. Monoclonal antibodies can be 202 produced commercially in vitro and used for this purpose. The method for producing monoclonal 203 antibodies requires the production of a hybridoma cell line requir ing cell fusion. Essentially, a B - 204 lymphocyte from the spleen of an immunized animal identified as produc ing neutralizing antibody is fused 205 in vitro to cells capable of constitutive antibody production . Cells from the fusion are screened for one that 206 produces the pathogen neutralizing antibody . Once identified, and isolated the cell is expanded into a cell 207 line. The cell line produces the antibody, which is purified and potentially may be used to directly treat 208 infected animals . Although this technology is currently very ex pensive, its importan ce in diagnostics and 209 continuous improvement of production technologies will potentially bring production costs down in the 210 future (Lorenzen et al., 1990) . Antibodies may also be used for the production of anti -idiotypic vaccines. 211 Thes e vaccines are produced by producing antibodies against neutralizing antibodies. The anti -idiotype 212 mimics the original antigen. Anti -idiotypic vaccines are useful against tumors (Meloen, 1997). 213 Bacterial plasmids are natural circular chromosomes composed of DNA that replicate independently of the 214 bacterial cell and provi de a natural means for bacteria to conjugally transfer genetic information between 215 bacteria (Meyer et al., 1975) . They may number in the hundreds per bacterial cell and naturally maintain 216 specific drug resistance genes . The potential of bacterial plasmids was developed with the introduction of 217 cloning specific DNA sequences (Bolivar et al., 1977). Bacterial c loning enabled the scientific study of DNA 218 sequences from many organisms (Sanger and Coulson, 1975) . Enzymes isolated from bacterial cells were 219 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 9 of 25 used for both cutting DNA at specific sequences and ligating it back together with new sequences inserted. 220 Amplification in bacterial culture of th is newly introduced DNA sequence on the plasmid provided 221 sufficient DNA for sequencing chemistry . With sequencing , a better understanding of how bacteria express 222 proteins developed and specific DNA sequences required for expression were identified and subsequently 223 introduced into plasmids to pro vide the machinery f or bacteria to express exogenous proteins. This work 224 extended to higher organisms that maintain plasmids such as yeasts , and has reached a third generation 225 with the successful construction of a DNA vaccine (Tang et al., 1992). DNA vacci nes are made from purified 226 bacterial plasmid DNA . DNA sequences encoding pathogen proteins are inserted into bacterial plasmid s 227 for antigen expression . Plasmid DNA containing antigenic inserts can be purified from bacterial cultures 228 inexpensively . 229 When injected into muscle cells, both DNA from the DNA vaccine and its expressed antigen are recogni zed 230 by the innate immune system . The antigen protein expressed by the DNA vaccine is also recognized and 231 processed as part of the adaptive and cellular immune response. B-cells proliferate when they recognize 232 their cognate antigen presented on the surface of an antigen presenting cell and produce neutralizing 233 antibodies against the pathogen. Other immune cells are involved in stimulat ing a long lasting cellular 234 immune response in the host (Tonheim et al., 2008). DNA vaccines agai nst infectious diseases have several 235 benefits including low cost, ease of production and improved quality control, heat stability, identical 236 production processes for diff erent vaccines, and the possibility of producing multivalent vaccines (Gilund 237 et al., 2008). Only two DNA vaccines are internationally license d for veterinary use, one is for vaccination 238 against West Nile Virus in horses and the other is against Infectious Hematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) virus in 239 Salmon. A Federal Register Notice dated December 31, 2013, announced a 30 day comment period for the 240 anticipated authorization by the USDA for shipment and sale of the DNA vaccine for IHN in the United 241 States (APHIS, 2013c ). This will be the first DNA vaccine licensed for aquaculture in the US . 242 243 Specific Uses of the Substance : 244 245 Local pathogens, pathogens transferred as a result of international trade, inadequate farm management, 246 environmental factors, and p oor water quality are the main causes of disease in aquaculture. In spite of 247 efforts to eradicate fish disease, unforeseen outbreaks can cause serious losses in production, impact ing the 248 livelihoods and food security of aquatic farmers. Disease control by vaccination offers one option to 249 consider when there is reason to doubt the practicability or likely success of eradication measures (Hill, 250 2005) . Vaccines for many fish diseases have been developed , but there are a number of diseases for which 251 there is no vaccine. 252 The economics of vaccination are important, since no vaccine is 100% effective. Some fish will not be 253 protected and some disease may still occur. However, an effective vaccine program will not only reduce 254 economic loss through reduced mortalitie s, but should also alleviate reduced growth rates due to infection 255 (Ellis, 1997a). Several examples of important fish bacterial disease vaccines follow and Table 1 provides the 256 availability of vaccines for the major bacterial fish diseases. 257 Vaccines shoul d be administered only to healthy fish. They are one component of a complete fish health 258 program (U.S. Fish and Wildlife S ervice , 2011). Unlike antibiotics, vaccines rely on a healthy fish immune 259 system to be effective and are used to prevent the occurrenc e of a specific disease outbreak (Yanong, 2008). 260 Vibriosis is one of the most serious bacterial diseases of farm raised fish affecting Pacific salmon, Atlantic 261 salmon, rainbow trout, turbot, sea bass, sea bream, striped bass, cod, Japanese and European eel and ayu. 262 There are a t least eight species of Vibrio which have been associated with diseases of fish . Vaccines are 263 available for four of them: V. anguillarum , produced for Vibriosis are bacterins ( inactivated bacterial culture ). Some may be 265 administered by immersion, but the most effective immune response is achieved by injection at a bout 1 266 month of age. Various adjuvants are added to the vaccines to improve immunogenicity. USDA approved 267 vaccines include Furogen, Lipogen Forte, Forte IV, and Vibrogen 2 (US Fish and W ildlife Service, 2011) . 268 Enteric redmouth (ERM) disease is caused by the pathogen Yersinnia ruckeri . It is primarily a disease of 269 freshwater fish including rainbow trout and Coho salmon . The ERM vaccine, an inactivated whole bacterial 270 cell vaccine was one of the first produced for aquaculture. It is effective both by immers ion or injection. In 271 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 10 of 25 the case of ERM and rainbow trout, if immersion vaccination of trout resulted in 1% more fish reaching the 272 market, the cost of the vaccine can be recovered (Ellis, 1997). 273 Furunculosis is an important disease of wild and farmed salmoni ds throughout the world , except South 274 America (Ellis, 1997b) . The bacterium causes furunculosis, immunoevasive. 275 Phagocytic cells called macrophages which are normally a first line of defense in fish disease response 276 cannot ki ll A. salmonicida in a na\u00efve host. However, vaccination with a whole cell bacterin that has been 277 emulsified in an oil based adjuvant overcomes bacterial immunoevasion and is effective in protecting the 278 fish. An important issue with oil based adjuvants is t he production of unsightly granulomatous lesions at 279 the injection site. In fact, many producers avoid the use of this type of vaccine which must be injected 280 because of the side effects. 281 Enteric septic emia of catfish (ESC) is a major disease problem facing commercial catfish production. The 282 etiological agent of ESC is Edwardsiella ictaluri . Another agent columnare is also economically 283 important. Vaccines containing bacterins for these pathogens hav e not been very effective, because they are 284 immunoevasive. L ive attenuated vaccines have emerged as the best choice for vaccination. Catfish fry 7 -10 285 days old can be effectively immunized by immersion for either of these agents ( Sommerset et al., 2005). 286 Vaccination is the most effective method of co ntrolling viral disease and commercial vaccines are available 287 for fish. Most of the virus vaccines available for aquaculture are inactivated/killed viral vaccines or 288 recombinant subunit proteins (Salgado -Miranda et al., 2013) . Table 1 provides a list of th e major viral fish 289 diseases and their respective vaccine availability. 290 Inactivated vaccines have been used for infectious pancreatic necrosis in Atlantic salmon and for grass carp 291 hemorrhagic disease. These rely heavily on the extent of treatment with che micals such as formal dehyde , 292 ethyleneimine or -propriolactone to preserve immunogenicity but prevent virulence. Inactivated virus 293 vaccines can be administered orally, by immersion or by injection depending on the particular vaccine. 294 Some must be administered with an adjuvant for a good response. In this case the vaccine is injected. 295 Inactivated vaccines are the most expensive to produce. 296 Modified live vaccines are desirable, and highly effective for closed systems . However, the virus is still 297 capa ble of infection . These vaccines have not usually been considered acceptable due to the environmental 298 risk that non -virulent viruses could revert to virulent forms or that attenuated viruses that are not virulent 299 in vaccinated species could prove virulent to other specie s in open systems (Salgado -Miranda et al., 2013) . 300 The aim of vaccination and developing improved vaccines is not only to reduce economic losses, but also to 301 prevent mass destruction of large numbers of infected or potentially contagious animals; to prevent the 302 transmission of infectious disease to humans ; to contribute to the health and welfare of domestic and wild 303 animals and to protect the environment (Pastoret et al., 1997). An ideal vaccine is economical; easy to 304 produce and administer; capable of inducing a strong, lasting and protective immunity in a single dose; 305 safe for fish, with minimum side effects; noninvasive and able to be administered early; stable at ambient 306 temperature; and without negative environmental impact (Salgado -Miranda, 2013). 307 308 Approved Legal Uses of the Substance: 309 310 The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) , Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), 311 Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) regulates veterinary biological products produced in, imported into, 312 transported through or exported fr om the United States. This ensure s that products are pure, safe, potent 313 and efficacious , and not worthless, contaminated, dangerous or harmful. The authorities and procedur es 314 for US regulation are described in the Virus Serum Toxin Act of 1913 (amended in 1985) and title 9 parts 315 101-121 of the US Code of Federal Regulations (Birnbaum, 1997). The re are other documents produced by 316 the USDA APHIS CVB supporting biologics regulation , guidance, use and approval. The licensing process 317 for vaccines in the US is rigorous requiring both validation of the vaccine and its adjuvants and inspection 318 of the manufacturing establishment . The USDA has approved the use of one DNA vaccine for fish and 319 aquaculture. A Federal Register Notice dated December 31, 2013 has been sent out for final comment 320 (APHIS, 2013c). 321 322 323 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 11 of 25 Action of the Substance : 324 325 Living organism are reactive systems, not preprogrammed. They respond in parallel to many concurren t 326 inputs for example DNA code, structural proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, lipids, intracellular signals, 327 hormones and other molecules that play key roles in both forming and informing the system (Cohen and 328 Harel, 2006). In responding to infection, fish o rganize the immune system and inflammation in a way that 329 attempts to maintain, heal, and regenerate damaged tissue (Raz et al., 2001). Pathogenesis and immune 330 response vary between fish and their pathogens. This is often an issue in both bacterial and vira l infections 331 because there is often significant variation in antigenicity within species. Generally, vaccination minimizes 332 pathogenesis by stimulating the immune system in advance of disease, so that vaccinates have already 333 undergone the first steps in the immune response prior to encountering the pathogen. 334 335 Combinations of the Substance : 336 337 Many chemicals are used in the preparation of fish vaccines. Both bacterial cell culture and animal cell 338 culture used to propagate bacteria and viruses require well -defined media that is usually not sourced 339 organically. 340 Most fish vacci nes are chemically inactivated. F ormaldehyde , ethyleneimine and -propriolactone are 341 commonly used for inactivation . None of them is included in the National List; however, other veterinary 342 vaccines that have been inactivated using these chemicals are included. 343 Adjuvants and /or immunostimulants are added to vaccines to improve antigenicity . The use of oil 344 adjuvants in injectable vaccines has been approved by the USD A for A. salmonicda , Y. ruckeri and Vibrio 345 species. Adjuvants are necessary for generating an effective immune response, because they prime the 346 innate immune system , leading to an expanded adaptive immune response. Adjuvants and 347 immunostimulants are not considered excipients. 348 Polyvalent vaccines are combination s of several antigen s, mixed together in optimized ratios to produce 349 strong immunity to all of the components. Antigens can be bacterial or viral, killed or attenuated. Some 350 vaccine combinations are effective ; however , antigen competition , and antigen interference , may prevent 351 other combinations . Vaccines combinations should always be used under veterinary supervision, because 352 incompatibility between vaccines from different sources may result in adve rse event s, i.e., injection site 353 reaction or return to virulence. 354 355 Status 356 357 Historic Use: 358 The National Organic Program (NOP) and the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) have 359 acknowledge d the importance of vaccines in preventing disease. The USDA organic regulations require 360 that the producer establish es and maintain s preventive livestock health care practices includin g 361 administration of vaccines and other veterinary biologics (7 CFR 205.238 (a)(6)). NOSB acknowledged that 362 the rise in vaccines developed using excluded methods made sourcing conventional vaccines increasingly 363 difficult; however , in the special case of vaccines, jeopardizing the health and safety of potentially milli ons 364 of animals or the public by prohibiting selected vaccines developed with excluded methods was not 365 considered an option (NOSB, 2009) . Ensuring that livestock producers are not hindered in preventing 366 disease in their herds, NOP changed the wording of section 205.105(e) and the regulation in regards to 367 vaccines. Pertinent to this discussion is the history of fish vacci nes which were first described in 1939, but 368 ignored until 1970, due to the rise in convenient chemotherapeutic method s for disease control (Evelyn, 369 1997). 370 Current b iomolecular methods are also effective for the development of cost effective vaccines, because the 371 same technologies used to determine the molecular basis for disease have been applied to vaccine 372 development. Canada has already licensed a DNA vaccine for i nfectious hematopoietic n ecrosis virus in 373 salmonids . This vaccine will also be available for fish in the United States (APHIS, 2013 c). Apex -IHN is the 374 first and only DNA vaccine licensed for commercial use in aquaculture. It was licensed in Canada in 2005 375 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 12 of 25 by Vical, a division of Novartis Animal Health , Inc . because an efficacious conventional vaccine for IHN 376 epizootics British Columbia from 2001 -2003 was not available (CFIA, 2005) . 377 Organic Foods Production Act, USDA Final Rule: 378 379 The OFPA describes organic wild seafood in \u00a76506(c) recommending that the USDA consult with the US 380 Department of Commerce to accommodate US Fisheries (7 U.S.C. 74, 2013) . However, NOSB's 381 recommendations are limited to aquaculture. The OFPA does provides an exemption for vaccination of 382 livestock in \u00a7 6509(d)(1)(C). The National Organic Program Final Rule defines vaccines as biologics ( USDA , 383 2013) consistent with 9 CFR Subchapter E \u2014Viruses, Serums, Toxins, and Analogous Products; 384 Organisms and Vectors. In addition, an exemption for vaccinatio n is provided in 7 CFR 205.105(e), that 385 refers back to 7 USC 6517 -6518 , whereas the vaccine is not harmful to human health or the environment; is 386 necessary for livestock production because there is no alternative; and fits with organic farming . In 387 addition , the reference (\u00a76518) provides f or further evaluation by the National Organic Standards Board 388 (NOSB). Section 205.238 of the USDA organic regulations on livestock health care , requires livestock 389 producers establish preventive health care practices including the administration of vaccines, even in the 390 absence of illness (\u00a7 205.238(a)(6) and (c)(2)) . 391 392 International 393 Canada - Canadian General Standards Board Permitted Substances List - 394 The Canadian General Standard for Organic Production Systems (CGSO P) defines va ccines as veterinary 395 biologics and mandates the establishment and maintenance of preventative livestock health care practices, 396 including the administration of vaccines in accordance with the standard when it has been documented 397 that the targeted diseases are communicable to livestock on the enterprise and cannot be combatted by 398 other means. The CGSOP permits vaccines to be used that have been grown on genetically engineered 399 substrates but are not themselves a product of genetic engineerin g, as specified in CAN/CGSB -32.311, 400 Organic Production Systems \u2014 Permitted Substances Lists (PWGSC, 2011a) . The Canadian General 401 Standards Board (CGSB) Permitted Substances List for Livestock Production classifies vaccines as health 402 care p roducts and restr icts vaccines to those that have been grown on genetically engineered substrates but 403 are not themselves a product of genetic engineering provided that there is documented evidence that the 404 targeted diseases are communicable to livestock on the enterprise a nd cannot be combated by other means, 405 and an analogous vaccine grown on a substrate not produced from genetic engineering is not commercially 406 available and a reasonable search of veterinary suppliers has been conducted (PWGSC, 2011b) . 407 The CGSB is in the process of developing a new national standard for organic aquaculture. It is sponsored 408 by the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. A standard has recently been published by the 409 Standards Council of Canada on aquaculture, CAN/CGSB -32.312 -2012. It does not currently fall under the 410 scope of Canada's Organic Products Regulations or Canada's trade equivalencies for organic products with 411 the United States or European Union. The standard will be reviewed and amended within five years, and 412 regulatio n and enforcement provisions will be sought. 413 CODEX Alimentarius Commission , Guidelines for the Production, Processing, Labelling and Marketing 414 of Organically Produced Foods (GL 32 -1999) - ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/005/Y2772e/Y2772e.pdf 415 The C odex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) defines organic livestock as any domestic or domesticated 416 animal including bovine (including buffalo and bison), ovine, porcine, caprine, equine, poultry and bees 417 raised for fo od or in the production of food . The CAC does not consider products of hunting or fishing of 418 wild animals as part of this definition (CAC, 1999) . Provisions for aquaculture are currently under review 419 and have been sent to member nations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission and interested international 420 organizations for comment on all aspects including possible implications of the proposed draft standard for 421 their economic interests. The next meeting of the Codex Committee of Food Labelling in 2014 will consider 422 these c omments and whether to amend GL 32-1999 to include organic aquaculture (CCFL, 2013) . 423 GL 32 -1999 includes the following reference to vaccination of livestock: t he use of veterinary medicinal 424 products in organic farming shall comply with the following principles: a) where specific disease or health 425 problems occur, or may occur, and no alternative permitted treatment or management practice exists, or, in 426 cases required by law, vaccination of livestock, the use of parasiticides, or ther apeutic use of veterinary 427 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 13 of 25 drugs are permitted. CAC also provides that a ll materials and/or the products produced from genetically 428 engineered/modified organisms (GEO/GMO) are not compatible with the principles of organic production 429 (growing, manufacturing, or processing) and therefore are not accepted under these guidelines (CAC, 430 1999). 431 European Economic Community (EEC) Council Regulation , EC No. 834/2007 and 889/2008 432 Regulation (EC ) No 834/2007 provides for organic aquaculture. It provides an exemption for the use of 433 GMO veterinary medicinal products; allows for the use of chemically synthesized allopathic products for 434 animal disease and permits the use of immunological medicines. 435 Regulation (EC) No 889/2008 states that it does not apply to produc ts originating from aquaculture , but 436 encourages that this work will follow. In this regulation, v eterinary treatment means all courses of a 437 curative or preventive treatment against one occurrence of a specific disease including vaccination . This 438 regulation provides that t he preven tive use of chemically -synthesiz ed allopathic medicinal products is not 439 permitted in EU organic farming. However, in the event of a sickness or injury of an animal requiring an 440 immediate treatment, the use of chemically synthesiz ed allopathic medicinal products should be limited to 441 a strict minimum and w ith the exception of vaccinations, treatments for parasites and compulsory 442 eradication schemes where an animal or group of animals receive more than three courses of treatments 443 with chemically -synthesiz ed allopathic veterinary medicinal products or antibiotics within 12 months, or 444 more than one course of treatment if their productive lifecycle is less than one year, the livestock concerned, 445 or produce derived from them, may not be sold a s organic products, and the livestock must undergo a 446 conversion period as mandated. Thus, vaccination is exempt in the EU organic rule for agriculture (The 447 Council of the European Union, 2008) . 448 Regulation (EC) No 710/2009 amends regulation 889/2008 to incl ude organic aquaculture. The use of 449 allopathic treatments is limited to two courses of treatment per year, with the exception of vaccinations and 450 compulsory eradication schemes. However, in the cases of a production cycle of less than a year a limit of 451 one allopathic treatment applies. If the mentioned limits for allopathic treatments are exceeded the 452 concerned aquaculture animals can not be sold as organic products (The Council of the European Union, 453 2009) . Regulation (EC) No 710/2009 refers to Council Directive 2006/88/EC which covers disease control 454 in aquaculture. This document references the OIE Aquatic Animal Health Code and the Manual for 455 Diagnostic Tests for Aquatic Animals (OIE, 2013). (The Council of the European Union, 2006) . Overarching 456 is the incumbent potential for epizootic spread of disease in an aquatic environment, notwithstanding the 457 transfer of disease in closed systems as a result of import. This documen t empowers the competent 458 author ity to control disease in aquaculture and requires vaccination against OIE listed diseases, unless the 459 participating member state has been declared free of this disease. 460 Japan Agricultural Standard (JAS) for Organic Production 461 The Japanese Agricultural Stan dard for Organic Livestock Products provides for ethical b iological drugs 462 and veterinary drugs as specified by Article 1. 1 of the Ministerial Ordinance for Handling Biological Drugs 463 and Veterinary Drugs by the Ministry of Health, Labo r and Welfare (No. 4 of 1961 MAFF, 2012) . Under 464 JAS standards, livestock disease is prevented by strengthening resistance to disease, infection , prevention, 465 through appropriate husbandry practices depending on livestock. However, disease can be alleviated 466 without undo suffe ring and with the use of vaccines as required by law or veterinary prescription. No 467 GMO vaccines are licensed under Japan's regulation s. 468 International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM) - 469 http://www.ifoam.org/standard/norms/cover.html 470 The IFOAM organic animal management systems follow the principle of positive health including 471 prevention of disease with vaccines . Vaccin es are allowed when a vaccination is legally required, an 472 endemic disease is known or expected to be a problem in the region and where this disease cannot be 473 controlled by other management techniques . IFOAM's norms make an exception for vaccines derived from 474 genetically modified organisms (IFOAM, 2012). 475 Soil Asso ciation 476 The Soil Association permits vaccination for specific known disease risks, but does not permit the use of 477 genetically engineered vaccines in their organic standard (Soil Association, 2013) . 478 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 14 of 25 Naturland Association for Organic Agriculture , www.naturland.de 479 Naturland was the first organization internationally to develop a standard for organic aquaculture. The 480 Naturland standard does not permit the use of genetically modified products or their derivatives in organic 481 aquaculture. However, it defers to veterinary supervision concerning issues of animal health and disease 482 prevention (Naturland, 2013). 483 KRAV (Sweden) 484 KRAV encourages that prophylactic work be carried out, including effective vaccination against re levant 485 infectious diseases, so that outbreaks of disease and use of drugs are avoided to the greatest possible extent. 486 However; this organization prohibits the use of GMO vaccines (KRAV, 2013). 487 China 488 In China, aquaculture producers may use vaccine inocula tion to prevent disease when there is the risk of 489 certain diseases that cannot be controlled by other management technology, or where it is provided for in 490 the state laws. Genetic ally engineer ed vaccine s are prohibited except for national c ompulsory 491 immuni zation vaccines (China, 2011) . 492 493 Evaluation Questions for Substances to be used in Organic Crop or Livestock Production 494 495 Evaluation Question #1: Indicate which category in OFPA that the substance fall s under: (A) Does the 496 substance contain an active ingredient in any of the following categories: copper and sulfur compounds, 497 toxins derived from bacteria; pheromones, soaps, horticultural oils, fish emulsions, treated seed, 498 vitamins and minerals; livestock paras iticides and medicines and production aids including netting, tree 499 wraps and seals, insect traps, sticky barriers, row covers, and equipment cleansers? (B) Is the substance 500 a synthetic inert ingredient that is not classified by the EPA as inerts of toxico logical concern (i.e., EPA 501 List 4 inerts) (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517(c)(1)(B)(ii))? Is the synthetic substance an inert ingredient which is not on 502 EPA List 4, but is exempt from a requirement of a tolerance, per 40 CFR part 180? 503 504 The substance falls into the categ ory of a medicine. Vaccines for aquaculture are veterinary medicinal 505 treatments acting to stimulate pathogen specific immunity in the absence of pathogenic infection. 506 507 Evaluation Question #2: Describe the most prevalent processes used to manufacture or formulate the 508 petitioned substance. Further, describe any chemical change that may occur during manufacture or 509 formulation of the petitioned substance when this substance is extracted from nat urally occurring plant, 510 animal, or mineral sources (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502 (21)). 511 512 All commercial vaccines for use in the United States must be produced by establishments that have 513 received establishment licenses from the USDA. The licensing process includes in spections of the 514 establishment's facilities to ensure that it is capable of producing vaccines that are safe, efficacious and free 515 of contaminant s. All of the commercial vaccines used in the United States must each be approved and 516 licens ed to ensure that the y are safe and efficacious. A list of v accines and bacte rins licensed by the USDA 517 for use in fish raised or sold in the US is provided in Table 4. 518 Most of the vaccines used for aquaculture are conventional killed vaccines against bacterial pathogens: 519 bacterins. Bacteria for these vaccines are cultured in large culture vessels called fermenters under controlled 520 conditions. An inactivant, usually formaldehyde , ethyleneimine or -propriolactone is introduced to the 521 culture, as it enters the stationery pha se of growth. The culture is washed to remove the inactivant, and the 522 dead cells are dispensed into aliquots and lyophilized for better storage. An adjuvant which is necessary to 523 improve the immunogenicity of the bacterin may be included with the bacterin prior to administration . 524 Adjuvants for fish are usually oil based emulsions or aluminum hydroxide. 525 There are several killed virus vaccines used for aquaculture in the United States. Viruses must be grown in 526 host cells. The host cells of choice are usually fish cell lines from common carp or salmon. Cells are grown 527 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 15 of 25 in bioreactors containing nutrient rich medium. Cells may be pre -infected with virus or virus may be 528 inoculated into cells as they reach sufficient density in culture. When the virus titer reache s an acceptable 529 level, virus in the culture is inactivated using formaldehyde, ethyleneimine or -propriolactone. The culture 530 is filtered to remove cell debris, and washed to remove the inactivant. The inactivated virus is dispensed 531 and usually lyophilized . An adjuvant which is necessary to improve the immunogenicity of the killed virus 532 may be included with the killed virus vaccine prior to administration . Adjuvants for fish are usually oil 533 based emulsions or aluminum hydroxide. 534 Modified live bacterial and viral vaccines are also grown in culture. Vaccines are dispensed and frozen or 535 lyophilized for storage. 536 DNA vaccines are plasmids produced within bacteria in culture. DNA plasmids are isolated from bacterial 537 culture by lysis of the bacterial cell and chromatographic purification of covalently closed circular DNA 538 from the lysed culture. Native DNA is not alive or infectious, thus it does not need to be chemically treated 539 or inactivated. Purified DNA is dispensed and lyophilize d for better storage. An adjuvant which is 540 necessary to improve the immunogenicity may be included with the DNA vaccine prior to administration . 541 Currently no other vaccine type is used for aquaculture. Although, other types of vaccines may be in use for 542 other animal species. 543 544 Table 4 Vaccines and bacterins currently licensed by the USDA for use in the United States1 APHIS Product Number** Vaccine Name APHIS Description Disease Vaccination 1K11.00 Renogen Arthrobacter Vaccine1 Bacterial Kidney Disease Injection 1443.20 (not commercially available) Cyprinid Herpesvirus Type 3 Vaccine, Modified Live Virus1 Spring Immersion Salmonicida - Vibrio in the US -IHN Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus, DNA vaccine Infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus Injection 1US Fish and Wildlife Service, 2011 2 The alphameric system used for product codes provides for a six -digit number of number -letter combination to be assigned to each product, i.e., the first digit denotes product types; second and third, group by agents; fourth, the viability of vaccine, (live, killed, mod ified live, etc.); fifth, substrates; and sixth, AG, Postfach CH -4002, Basel, Switzerland 4Merck Animal Health, Merck & Co., 556 Morris Avenue, Summit, NJ, 07901 -1330, USA, +1 -908-473-3349 545 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 16 of 25 Evaluation Question #3: Discuss whether the petitioned substance is formulated or manufactured by a 546 chemical process, or created by naturally occurring biological processes (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6502 (21) ). 547 548 Vaccines are created by naturally occurring biological process es including cell culture and fermentation. 549 For most aquaculture vaccines, an infectious agent is used as the immunogen. The infectious agent can be a 550 virus, a bacterium, a fungus or a protozoan. Each of these requires a different culture system, but they are 551 grown naturally to produce as much antigen as possible per unit volume of culture medium. Viruses are 552 grown in cell culture, since they depend on a living host for replication. Bacteria are grown in fermenters. 553 In fish cell culture, cells are removed from fish tissue and enzymatically or mechanically disaggregated 554 before cultivation. Several continuous fish cell lines have al so been established . Normal cells usually divide 555 only a limited number of times before losing their ability to prolifera te, which is a genetically determined 556 event known as senescence; these cell lines are known as finite. However, some cell lines become immortal 557 through a process called transformation, which can occur spontaneously or can be chemically or virally 558 induced. When a finite cell line undergoes transformation and acquires the ability to divide indefinitely, it 559 becomes a continuous cell line. Culture conditions vary for each cell type, but the artificial environment in 560 which the cells are cultured invariably con sists of a suitable vessel containing the following: a substrate or 561 medium that supplies the essential nutrients (amino acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals) ; growth 562 factors ; hormones ; gases (O 2, CO 2) and a regulated physico -chemical environment (pH, osmotic pressure, 563 temperature) . Most cells are anchorage -dependent and must be cultured while attached to a solid or semi - 564 solid substrate (adherent or monolayer culture), while others can be grown floating in the culture medium 565 (suspension culture). Cell l ines are usually cryopreserved by treating with the appropriate protective agent 566 (e.g., DMSO or glycerol) and stor ing at temperatures below -130\u00b0C (cryopreservation) until they are 567 needed. In vaccine production, this is a major advantage because batches of virus can be produced 568 consistently and reproducibly from the same a batch of clonal cells. If the vaccine is to be killed, it is 569 inactivated by the introduction of a preservative to the culture. This is usually followed by washing and 570 filtering. If the va ccine is a modified live vaccine the final product is usually lyophilized and resuspended 571 when needed. Immersion vaccines are resuspended in tank water. Injectable killed vaccines are usually 572 administered with an adjuvant consisting of an oil emulsion or a luminum hydroxide . 573 Bacterial vaccines are grown in vessel s containing culture medium under controlled conditions. Medium 574 consists of digested meat or vegetable products and salt. More fastidious bacteria may require additional 575 nutrients. Modified live vac cines may simply consist of the culture medium itself. Fish are usually 576 vaccinated by immersion with modified live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are treated with preservatives 577 and may be adjuvant ed, but can be delivered by either immersion or injection. 578 DNA vaccines, plasmids contained within in living bacteria, are also grown in fermenters. When the 579 culture reaches stationary phase, the bacteria are lysed enzymatically and DNA is extracted. Plasmid DNA 580 is isolate d from cell debris and other DNA based on its ability to remain supercoiled. Plasmid DNA is 581 stable as a lyophilized or frozen product. In the case of DNA vaccines, restriction enzymes must be used to 582 construct the DNA plasmid so that it functions properly when used. These enzymes are derived from 583 bacteria and fungi, or may be synthetically produced . DNA vaccines are made with or constructed using 584 biomolecular methods. The exemption under section 205.105 allows vaccines from excluded methods to be 585 considered for addition to the National List . 586 587 Evaluation Question #4: Describe the persistence or concentration of the petitioned substance and/or its 588 by-products in the environment ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (2)) . 589 590 Killed vaccines do not persist in t he environment or in the vaccinated fish . Once administe red, the fish's 591 antibodies and phagocytic antigen presenting cells begin the process of removing the vaccine and building 592 an immune response. The vaccine is digested and excreted during this process. 593 Modified live vaccines are designed primarily for admini stration in closed systems or in isolation tanks , 594 because their release into the environment may inadvertently cause a toxic reaction to wildlife and studies 595 to determine the extent of this side -effect are very costly . There are currently three modified live vaccines 596 licensed for commercial use in the US. These vaccines are for bacterial kidney disease (Renogen ), enteric 597 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 17 of 25 septicemia of catfish (AQUAVAC -ESC) and columnaris disease (AQUAVAC -COL ). Safety studies 598 required by the USDA Animal Plant Health Ins pection Service, Center for Veterinary Biologics for these 599 vaccines include using ten times the immunizing dose and direct fish to fish passage. In addition studies 600 are done that consider the release of the vaccine into the environment and the ability of t he vaccine to infect 601 people (Shoemaker and Klesius, 2009). 602 DNA f rom DNA vaccines has a half -life ranging from three to six hours in fresh or marine aquatic 603 environments. DNA attached to particulate material in an aquatic environment may last longer up to one 604 hundred and forty hours (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994). Conditions required for bacterial transformation 605 by the DNA are not like ly to be found in open water (Alvarez et al., 1996). There is no evidence that naked 606 DNA released from vaccination will enter into surrounding organisms. 607 608 Evaluation Question #5: Describe the toxicity and mode of action of the substance and of its breakdown 609 products and any contaminants. Describe the persistence and areas of concentration in the environme nt 610 of the substance and its breakdown products ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (2)) . 611 612 Vaccination of fish developed because the administration of antibiotics to fish in aquaculture was not 613 sustainable: particularly for lower valued species (Midtlying , 1997). However, vaccination can lead to 614 several types of toxic reactions for bo th the administrator and vaccinated animals. Self-injection on the 615 fingers and hands of the operators can lead to allergic hyperse nsitivity and anaphy lactic reaction. 616 Improve ments have been made with repeating syringes, such as the addition of a safety bow. However, 617 adrenalin is recommended onsite, if self -injection does oc cur (Leira and Baalsrud, 1997). 618 Because food from fish is considered beneficial as a result of the effect s of omega -3 polyunsaturated fats on 619 cardiovascular and Alzheimer's diseases, more scrutiny has been given to the potential transmission of 620 bovine spongiform encephalop athy from fish to humans. Serums used for the culture of viral vaccines and 621 media used f or the culture of bacterial vaccines may at times contain bovine products. Although the USDA, 622 Animal Plant Health Inspection Service is not likely to permit licensed establishment to use contaminated 623 products, prion free status should be verified for vaccines produced outside the jur isdiction of the USDA 624 (Friedland et al., 2009) . 625 Killed vaccines are inactivated with formaldehyde. During processing the vaccine is washed to remove 626 formaldehyde, however; residual formaldehyde can produce toxic effects in fish. Furthermore, fish must be 627 anesthetized prior to vaccination by injection. Stress caused by anesthesia is significant and likely adds to 628 the potentially toxic effects of residual inactivating chemicals. 629 Some reports have described autoimmune disease d evelopment in farmed salmon after vaccination with oil 630 adjuvanted vaccines . Granulomas are sometimes observed at the injection site. In addition fish can exhibit 631 decreased carcass quality, spinal deformities, uveitis, and inflammation in the abdominal cavi ty (Haugarvol 632 et al., 2010). There is a possibility of increased risk of infection with unvaccinated pathogens as a result of 633 vaccine induced autoimmunity. On the other hand , vaccines that are adjuvanted with aluminum salts 634 produce injection site lesions with much lower frequency. Notwithstanding , immunoprophylaxis can 635 largely reduce risks for large scale animal suffering caused by disease epizootics in fish farming (Midtlying, 636 1997). 637 638 Evaluation Question #6: Describe any environmental contamination that could result from the 639 petitioned substance's manufacture, use, misuse, or disposal ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (3)) . 640 641 Several studies have investigated a hypothetical set of unforeseen outcomes affecting the enviro nment 642 involving the administration of DNA vaccines (Gillund et al., 2008a, b). For example, 1) plasmid DNA 643 (pDNA) remains in circulation in the aquatic system and is taken up by microorganisms that change as a 644 result of the new DNA; 2) pDNA integrates into gonadial tissue of vaccinated fish resulting in offspring 645 with disease resistance; 3) possibility for detection of pDNA in humans after they eat vaccinated fish; and 4) 646 immunological consequences affecting these humans as a result of consuming the fish. A lthough not 647 support ed by strong evidence, these authors provide their information on the basis of the Walker and 648 Harremo\u00ebs (W&H) uncertainty framework, a tool to systematically identify scientific uncertainty. They 649 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 18 of 25 conclude that more research into the disp osition of DNA vaccines for aquaculture into the environment 650 needs to be done. Som e information concerning the rareness of pDNA integration in marine bacteria 651 mammals is available, but no information concerning actual adverse occurrence s could be found (Lorentz 652 and Wackernagel, 1994 ). DNA integration is a very rare event in vertebrates, even when DNA is 653 deliberately introduced for the purpose of integration. Exhaustive studies have shown that DNA 654 integration is possible, but the rate of integration is f ar lower than the rate of spontaneous mutation (Hepell 655 and Davis, 2000) . 656 In the cases of killed and modified live vaccines, there is a potential for incomplete inactivation for a 657 particular vaccine lot leaving live pathogen in the vaccine and the reversion to virulence of the modified 658 live vaccine inadvertently precipitating a new epizootic through vaccination. The vaccines themselves 659 contain mostly organic material that rapidly degrades in the environment. 660 Vaccines produced under USDA license are manufact ured in ultraclean manufacturing facilities. Both 661 environmental and cross contamination are routin ely avoided in these establishments and the solid wastes 662 arising from them are scrupulously decontaminated using fumigation, or heat sterilization. Disposal o f 663 decontaminated material may be complicated by the addition of the decontaminants which include 664 formaldehyde. The EPA provides stringent regulations for the discharge of this material. Thus , it is unlikely 665 that vaccines for use in aquaculture produce environmentally detrimental waste as a result of their 666 manufacture (OIE, 1991). 667 668 Evaluation Question #7: Describe any known chemical interactions between the petitioned substance 669 and other subs tances used in organic crop or livestock production or handling. Describe any 670 environmental or human health effects from these chemical interactions ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (1)) . 671 672 Most vaccines for aquaculture are manufactured directly from pathogens, some of which ar e pathogenic for 673 humans as well . Bacteria are the others. 675 Even with vaccination there is always the risk of exposure to the pathogens themselves, including the 676 potential of producing contaminated fish ( Austin, 2010; Boylan, 2011). Prudent veterinary practice in 677 aquaculture suggests vaccinat ion of only healthy animals . This is not only to prevent needless suffering of 678 animals, but also to prevent contamination of food with potentially zoonotic pathogens. 679 680 Evaluation Question #8: Describe any effects of the petitioned substance on biological or chemical 681 interactions in t he agro -ecosystem, including physiological effects on soil organisms (including the salt 682 index and solubility of the soil) , crops, and ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (5)) . 683 684 The fish 's immune system protects against diseases by detecting, identifying and removing pathogens; 685 preventing the emergence of tumors and contributing to the processes that maintain stable conditions 686 (homeostasis) during development and growth and after inflammatory reaction s or tissue damage. The 687 immune system is classically divided into the innate and the adaptive arms. The adaptive component of the 688 teleost fish immune system drives the production of antibodies and cellular immunity in fish. The innate 689 system is an evolutionar ily ancient system present in both invertebrates and vertebrates (Magnadottir, 690 2010). T he innate component of the fish immune system specifically recognizes pathogenic and non - 691 pathogenic microorganisms and a number of molecules including cytokines, chemokines, 692 interferon , polysaccharides, peptidogl ycans, proteins, set of inheritable germ line encoded 693 pathogen pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that initiate a response. These receptors sen se particular 694 structures in microorganism s called pathogen associate d molecular patterns (PAMPs) representing literally 695 thousands of specific molecules. The PAMPs and the PRRs mediate interactions with pathogenic and non - 696 pathogenic microorganisms requiring coordination between multiple PRR signaling pathways that dictate 697 the outcome of viral infectio n, and microbial colonization regardless of whether it is symbiotic coexistence, 698 asymptomatic infection, or virulent disease (Boltana et al., 2011). The innate and adaptive immune 699 receptors are functionally integrated into a single immune system that monit ors the fish's immune health 700 (Cohen, 2007). Many experiments have shown that fish, which survive infection, will show enhanced 701 disease resistance or complete immunity on second encounter. A key element, as mentioned above, is 702 adaptive immunity, the appear ance of memory cells and specific antibodies. The basic aim of vaccination is 703 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 19 of 25 to imitate this process. Vaccination should thus activate both the innate and the adaptive system and lead 704 to lasting protection (Magnadottir, 2010). Most of the current vaccines for fish contain adjuvants that 705 stimulate the innate arm of the immune system and subsequently the adaptive arm. They do this by 706 imitating PAMPs, increasing the innate response and augmenting the activities of the adaptive arm's 707 cellular components such as dendritic cells, lymphocytes and macrophages , thus mimicking a natural 708 infection. In some cases, this boost is very traumatic and results in extensive cell damage and potential 709 immune disease (Israeli, 2009). Pathological changes can occur in various organs in farmed fish as a part of 710 systemic autoimmune inflammatory conditions induced by vaccination. The vaccination protects the fish 711 from a series of pathogens, but as a consequence, serious immune -related pathological conditions m ay be 712 induced (Haugervoll et al., 2010) . 713 One DNA vaccine , anticipated to be licensed in the US is available for infectious hematopoietic necrosis 714 virus (Tonheim, 2008 ; APHIS, 2013c ). DNA vaccines are injected into the muscle tissue of fish. DNA is a 715 PRR that activates the innate immune system. P rotein expressed from the DNA vaccine by phagocytic cells 716 (macrophages, dendritic cells and lymphocytes) and at the injection site is presented by antigen 717 presentation cells subsequently activating cells involved i n the adaptive response: antibody production and 718 cellular immunity. Residual DNA is mostly digested ; however, DNA may be observed in the recipient cells 719 up to 45 days post injection . Integration of pDNA injected intramuscularly in mice was studied with a 720 sensitive polymerase chain reaction method showing no evidence of integration at a sensitivity of 1.3 x 10-9 721 integrations per cell (Ledwith et al., 2001). DNA vaccine integration in fish ha s not been established 722 experimentally. 723 Naked DNA is neither infecti ous nor viable. Although free DNA is present in the environment it is not 724 persistent. Data shows that extracellular DNA turns over rapidly in an aquatic environment ( Alvarez et al., 725 1996) . Natural genetic transformation of bacteria encompasses the active uptake by a cell of free 726 extracellular DNA and heritable incorporation of its genetic information . Natural transformation only 727 occurs in bacterial species (Lorenz and Wackernagel, 1994). 728 Since live vaccine strains (attenuated by natural selection or laboratory methods ) are potentiall y released 729 into the environment by vaccinates , safety issues concerning the veterinary as well as environmental 730 aspects must be considered. These involve (i) chan ges in cell, tissue and host tropism, (ii) virulence of the 731 carrier through the incorporation of foreign genes, (iii) reversion to virulence by acquisition of 732 complementation genes, (iv) exchange of genetic information with other vaccine or wild -type strai ns of the 733 carrier organism and (v) spread of undesired genes such as antibiotic resistance genes. Before live vaccines 734 are applied, the safety issues must be thoroughly evaluated case-by-case. Safety assessment includes 735 knowledge of the precise function an d genetic location of the genes to be mutated, their genetic stability, 736 potential reversion mechanisms, possible recombination events with dormant genes, gene transfer to other 737 organisms as well as gene acquisition from other organisms by phage transduction, transposition or 738 plasmid transfer and cis - or trans -complementation (Frey, 2007) . 739 740 Evaluation Question #9: Discuss and summarize findings on whether the use of the petitioned 741 substance may be ha rmful to the environment ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (i) and 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (2) (A) 742 (i)). 743 744 The fish immune system is the first immune system in vertebrate evolution to possess an adaptive immune 745 system. It enables fish to mount a unique lasting immune response against pathogens. Vaccines, through 746 the adaptive immune system , permit fish to develop resistance to a pathogen in the absence of a virulent 747 challenge. 748 Host density plays a role in the spread of fi sh diseases in the environment amongst far med and wild fish . 749 Low host density reduces the rate of encounter between susceptible hosts and pathogen. Increased host 750 density will favor more rapid disease spread. In any population, there is a density threshold where disease 751 spread can become epizootic . Effective aquaculture increases host density. Vaccines are effective at 752 reducing the density of susceptible hosts and their use can lead to disease eradication. However, 753 vaccination can be imperfect and lead to virulence evolution, potentially affecting wild and farmed fish and 754 other species (Krkosek, 2010). 755 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 20 of 25 756 Evaluation Question #10: Describe and summarize any reported effects upon human health from use of 757 the petitioned substance (7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (i), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 (2) (A) ( i)) 6518 758 (m) (4)) . 759 760 Self-injection appears to be the most important human health risk associated with aquaculture vaccination 761 (Liera and Baalsrud, 1997). Otherwise, no adverse reports of zoo notic transmission to food resulting from 762 vaccina tion have been reported. All vaccines used in the US or administered to animals in the US must be 763 licensed by the US Department of Agriculture . In order for them to be licensed, they must be unequivocally 764 shown to be safe for human health (APHIS, 2013). 765 Where a pathogen is infectious for both fish and humans, v accinating fish can also prevent pathogen 766 transmission to humans . Streptococcus iniae , a pathogen in tilapia, catfish, and striped bass can potentially 767 cause cellulitis of the human hand. Vibrio and Edwardsiella both of which are fish pathogens may cause 768 gastroenteritis and wound infection in humans ( Austin, 2010; Boylan, 2011). 769 770 Evaluation Question #11: Describe all natural (non -synthetic) substances or products which may be 771 used in place of a pet itioned substance ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6517 (c) (1) (A) (ii)) . Provide a list of allowed 772 substances that may be used in place of the petitioned substance ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (6)) . 773 774 Farmed fish are kept at high population densities. In closed systems, where fish are raised in ponds or 775 tanks , new fish stocks are introduced at various stages of development originating from dome stic or 776 international sources. While i n open systems , fish are often in close proximity to wild fish reservoirs. These 777 situations are ideal f or the emergence of wild -type pathogens that exist benignly when fish are kept at low 778 density. High host density increases the spread of aquatic pathogens between farmed fish and from farmed 779 fish to wild fish that enter into or come into close proximity wi th net cages and with fish escaping from 780 them (Kibenge et al., 2012) . 781 The mucosal layer is the first line of defense against pathogens for fish. In fact, mucus covers all external 782 surfaces of the fish, gills, and all of the internal surfaces of the gut. Epithelial cells secrete mucus which 783 forms a protective barrier. The muc us layer contains many cells and functional substances support ing both 784 innate and adaptive immunity. Under normal conditions , the mucus layer resists the penetration of 785 pathogen bacteria and viruses, hosting an active gut flora that supports fish health (Cain and Swan, 2011). 786 Early in development , commensal and favorable bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract stim ulate immune 787 activities and localized morphological development. The GI micro -flora play s a role in maintaining effective 788 functionality after the GI tract develops (Dimitroglou et al., 2011). Normal micro -flora confers many 789 benefits to the intestinal physiology of the host including metabolism of nutrients and organic substrates, 790 and the contribution of the phenomenon of colonization resistanc e. However, when this balance is upset, 791 pathogens that arrive or that have already been present but in numbers too small to cause disease take the 792 opportunity to multiply. Probiotic supplementation can assist in returning a disturbed micro -flora to its 793 normal beneficial composition, and influence the fish immune response in different ways. They can 794 increase the proportion of phagocytically active cells and induce the activation of complement receptor 795 expression. They also can modulate the secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines (Gomez and Balcazar, 796 2007). Fish feeds with additives that enhance the GI tract micro -flora are preventative and intervention 797 strategies against aquatic methylated, ( Kibenge al., 2012) . 800 A number of herbal immunostimulants administered at various concentrations orally or through injection 801 have been found to stimulate the innate and adaptive immune response in freshwater and marine fish 802 against various bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. Herbal extracts can be used alone or with vaccines to 803 enhance efficacy. A ctive substances in herbs include metabolic enhancers, immune system stimulants , 804 broad spectrum antimicrobial and environmental stress relief (Harakrishnan et al., 2011). In one example, 805 farmed kelp grouper, Epinephelus bruneus fed a mushroom (Inonotus obliquus ) 806 extract, protected against a virulent vibriosis challenge (Harkrishnan et al., 2012). 807 808 Technical Evaluation Report Vaccines for Aquaculture Livestock January 24, 2014 Page 21 of 25 Evaluation Question #12: Describe any alternative practices that would make the use of the petitioned 809 substance unnecessary ( 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6518 (m) (6)) . 810 811 Aquaculture diagnostic technologies are important not only to detect existing disease, but to predict disease 812 movement. Improved applied methodologies for immunodiagnos tics, direct or indirect fluorescence - 814 based approaches such as in situ hybridization using pathogen -specific gene probes, polymerase chain 815 reaction (PCR), reverse transcription -PCR an d quantitative real -time PCR (qPCR) can augment 816 epidemiological models provid ing better information for the process of infection and progressive disease . 817 Better models will allow greater control over movement of stock and placement of enclosures to limit 818 infection and eradicate diseases . Recruitment of trans national organizations such as the International 819 Organization for Animal Disease Control (OIE) and the Worl d Health Organization (WTO) to assist in 820 disease surveillance c ould improve resources for reduc ing the risk of international spread of aquatic animal 821 diseases, including early warning of disease outbreaks, planning and monitor ing of disease control 822 program s, provision of sound aquatic animal health advice to farms, certification of exports, as well as 823 international reporting and verification of freedom from particular diseases. The development of healthy 824 and/or specific pathogen free stocks , genetic imp rovement of fish stocks (e.g., disease tolerant, growth rate 825 and feed conversion efficiency) and documented histories that assure freedom from disease over will also 826 facilitate reducing vaccine use (Browdy et al., 2012). Lower fish densities , good husbandry and attention to 827 biosecurity in closed systems also support fish health. 828 829 Refe rences 830 831 Adams, A., Thompson, K.D., and Roberts, R.J.
