Evaluations may be made as frequently as the department considers desirable and shall be made with respect to every person at intervals not exceeding six (6) months. Reports of eval\u00ad uation made pursuant to this section shall be filed with the court which vested custody of the person with the department. Reports of evaluation shall be provided to persons having full or partial legal or physical custody of a child. Failure of the department to evaluate a person or to reevaluate him within six (6) months of a previous examination shall not of itself entitle the person to a change in disposition but shall enti\u00ad tle him, his parent, guardian or custodian or his counsel to petition the court pursuant to section 16-1622, Idaho Code. (5)In a consultive capacity, the department shall assist communi\u00ad ties in the development of constructive programs for the protection, prevention and care of children and youth.

There shall be a rebuttable presumption that if a child is placed in the custody of the department and was also placed in out of the home care for a period not less than fifteen (15) out of the last twenty-two (22) months from the date the child entered shelter care, the department shall initiate a petition for termination of parental rights. This presumption may be rebutted by a finding of the court that the filing of a petition for termination of parental rights would not be in the best interests of the child or reasonable efforts have not been provided to reunite the child with his family, or the child is placed permanently with a relative. (10)The department shall establish appropriate administrative pro\u00ad cedures for the conduct of administrative reviews and hearings as required by federal statute for all children committed to the department and placed in out of the home care.

(1) Any physician may perform an abortion not prohibited by this act and any hospital or other facility described in section 18-608, Idaho Code, may provide facilities for such proce\u00ad dures without, in the absence of negligence, incurring civil liability therefor to any person including, but not limited to, the pregnant patient and the prospectiv e father of the fetus to have been born in the absence of abortion, if informed consent for such abortion has been duly given by the pregnant patient. (2)In order to provide assistance in assuring that the consent to an abortion is truly informed consent, the director of the department of health and welfare shall publish easily comprehended, nonmisleading and medically accurate printed material to be made available at no expense to physicians, hospitals or other facilities providing abortion and abortion-related services, and which shall contain the following: (a)Descriptions of the services available to assist a woman through a pregnancy, at childbirth and while the child is dependent, including adoption services, a comprehensive list of the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of public and private agencies that provide such services and financial aid available; (b)Descriptions of the physical characteristics of a normal fetus, described at two (2) week intervals, beginning with the fourth week and ending with the twenty-fourth week of development, accompanied by scientifically verified photographs of a fetus during such stages of development.

If the patient requests to view the ultrasound image, she shall be allowed to view it before an abortion is performed. The physician or agent shall also offer to pro\u00ad vide the patient with a physical picture of the ultrasound image of her unborn child prior to the performance of the abortion, and shall provide it if requested by the patient. In addition to providing the material, the attending physician may provide the pregnant patient with such other information which in the attending physician's judgment is relevant to the pregnant patient's decision as to whether to have the abortion or carry the pregnancy to term.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. That Chapter 15, Title 42, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and designated as Section 42-1508, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: c.262 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 777 42-1508. WOOD RIVER BASIN -- ENHANCEMENT OF INSTREAM FLOWS AND DOWNSTREAM WATER SUPPLIES. (1) The water resource board is hereby autho\u00ad rized and directed to appropriate and hold in trust for the people of the state of Idaho minimum stream flow water rights in designated reaches of the Big Wood River and the Little Wood River for the purpose of preserving, restoring and enhancing fish and wildlife habitat, aquatic life, recreation, aesthetic beauty, navigation, transportation and water quality, and to enhance the water supply for other existing downstream water rights, in accordance with the provisions of this sec\u00ad tion. The designated reaches are in the Big Wood River immediately below the Bellevue diversion (45 district canal) downstream to the United States geological survey gage station number 13140800, located below Stanton Crossing and above Magic Reservoir; and in the Little Wood River from the confluence of Silver Creek downstream to the U.S. bureau of land management diversion located near the city of Richfield. (2)The water resource board is authorized and directed to appro\u00ad priate minimum stream flow water rights in amounts up to sixty (60) cfs in the designated reach of the Big Wood River, and up to seventy-four (74)cfs in the designated reach of the Little Wood River under this section and in accordance with the provisions of section 42-1503, Idaho Code. In acting upon the applications for permit, the director of the department of water resources need not determine that the appropriations are capable of being maintained based upon records of existing stream flows, because it is anticipated that the water rights will be satisfied and maintained over time through the donation of water rights to the board and the operation of the water supply bank within the Wood River basin consistent with the provisions of section 42-17658, Idaho Code. In addition, the director need not determine that the appropriations meet a minimum amount as defined in section 42-1502(f), Idaho Code, or limit appropriations that might exceed such an amount, because of the need to fulfill the purpose of enhancing water supplies for other existing down\u00ad stream water rights. SECTION 2. That Chapter 17, Title 42, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and designated as Section 42-17658, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 42-17658. WOOD RIVER BASIN WATER RIGHTS DONATED TO ENHANCE INSTREAM FLOWS AND DOWNSTREAM WATER SUPPLIES --LOCAL COMMITTEE. (1) The water resource board is authorized to accept the donation by gift, grant or bequest of water rights, in whole or in part, from the Big Wood River upstream of the United States geological survey gage station number 13140800 located below Stanton Crossing and above Magic Reservoir, and from Silver Creek tributary to the Little Wood River, and to place eli\u00ad gible portions of the water rights into the water supply bank. Section 42-1765, Idaho Code, and the board's water supply bank rules shall apply to the operation of the water supply bank in the Wood River basin, except as inconsistent with this section. Ground water rights shall not be eligible for donation under this section. (2)The board shall appoint a local committee to facilitate dona\u00ad tions of eligible water rights and to adopt local procedures. The local committee shall be comprised of the members of the water district 37/37M advisory committee. In addition, the district watermaster and other 778 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.262 2007 individuals that may be appointed by the board, upon recommendation of the advisory committee, shall serve as ex officio members of the local committee. (3)Upon acceptance of the ownership of the donated rights by the board, the appointed local committee shall have authority to accept the water rights, in whole or in part, into the water supply bank. (4)Donated water rights may be accepted into the water supply bank to satisfy the board's minimum stream flow water rights authorized under section 42-1508, Idaho Code, and to satisfy existing minimum stream flow water rights previously appropriated by the board on Silver Creek and the Big Wood River; provided, that the director of the department of water resources, upon recommendation of the local committee, determines that there will be an equivalent reduction in the extent of consumptive use made under the donated water right, and that injury will not result to other water rights. The burden of proof shall be on the owner of the donated water right to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that injury will not result to other water rights. For purposes of water rights distribution under chapter 6, title 42, Idaho Code, water rights donated pursuant to this section shall retain their respective priority dates; provided however, that the local committee will recommend and the director shall condition or limit the use of donated water rights as necessary to avoid injury to other water rights and to provide for con\u00ad tinued incidental recharge, or managed recharge, as necessary to main\u00ad tain historic recharge patterns, and the provisions of section 42-1766, Idaho Code, shall apply to any appeals by water right holders regarding the use of the donated water rights. All donated water rights with points of diversion on the Big Wood River downstream of the 45 district canal shall flow through the bypass canal and be returned to the Big Wood River through the western branch of the 57F canal from the 57F divide. In addition, all water rights from the southern branch of the 57F divide shall be delivered through the bypass extension canal. A mea\u00ad suring device approved by the watermaster shall be installed at the beginning of the western branch of the 57F canal. (5)For purposes of this section, the board and local committee may not accept for enhanced flows in the Big Wood River any water rights currently diverted into the Bellevue triangle via the 45 district canal (Bellevue diversion). In addition, all donated water rights with points of diversion located on the Big Wood River upstream of the 45 district canal shall be diverted into the 45 district canal in order to enhance local water supplies and to increase stream flows in Silver Creek and the Little Wood River. (6)Water rights placed into the water supply bank from the Silver Creek and Little Wood River portions of the Wood River basin pursuant to this section may only be used to increase stream flows in Silver Creek and the Little Wood River. (7)The watermaster for water district 37/37M shall collect water district expenses pursuant to chapter 6, title 42, Idaho Code, from the water users receiving water as a result of enhanced downstream water supplies provided pursuant to this section, as determined by the water\u00ad master for water district 37/37M in cooperation with the local commit\u00ad tee. Any additional water district expenses resulting from the adminis\u00ad tration of water rights donated under this section shall be treated as expenses related to the administration of nonconsumptive water rights under section 42-605A, Idaho Code, and shall be collected by the water-c.263 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 779 master from the owners of the donated water rights or other persons agreeing to pay such costs. SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY. The provisions of this act are hereby declared to be severable and if any provision of this act or the appli\u00ad cation of such provision to any person or circumstance is declared invalid for any reason, such declaration shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this act.

In the event of a transfer, which should be made unless the court finds it contrary to the interest of the juvenile or adult, the jurisdiction of the receiving court shall attach to the same extent as if the court had original jurisdiction. (10)Upon conviction of a juvenile held for adult criminal proceed\u00ad ings under this section, the sentencing judge may, if a finding is made that adult sentencing measures would be inappropriate: (a)Sentence the convicted person in accordance with the juvenile sentencing options set forth in this chapter; or (b)Sentence the convicted person to the county jail or to the cus\u00ad tody of the state board of correcti on but suspend the sentence or withhold judgment pursuant to section 19-2601, Idaho Code, and com\u00ad mit the defendant to the custody of the department of juvenile cor\u00ad rections for an indeterminate period of time in accordance with sec\u00ad tion 20-520(l)(qr), Idaho Code.

However, in no event may the total of the actual time spent by the convicted person in the custody of the department plus any adult sentence imposed by the court exceed the maximum period of imprisonment that could be imposed on an adult convicted of the same crime. (c)If a convicted person is given a suspended sentence or withheld judgment conditioned upon the convicted person's compliance with all reasonable program requirements of the department pursuant to para\u00ad graph (b) of this subsection, and if the department reasonably believes that the convicted person is failing to comply with all reasonable program requirements, the department may petition the sentencing court to revoke the conmitment to the department and transfer the convicted person to the county jail or to the custody of the state board of correction for the remainder of the sentence.

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. Any other provision of law notwithstanding, there is hereby appropriated the following amount to be transferred to the Public School Income Fund for the period July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007: FROM: Public Education Stabilization Fund $3,892,600 SECTION 2. In addition to the appropriation made in Section 3, Chapter 418, Laws of 2006 and Section 23, House Bill No. 1, as enacted by the First Extraordinary Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legisla\u00ad ture, there is hereby appropriated to the Educational Support Program/D ivision of Operations the following amount for the period July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007: FROM: Public School Income Fund $3,892,600 SECTION 3. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall distrib\u00ad ute $121,300 of the moneys appropriated in Section 2 of this act to school districts in the amount of any unequalized school maintenance and operation levy funds that would have been used to calculate such levies for tax year 2006, under the laws of the state of Idaho as they existed prior to the First Extraordinary Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Leg\u00ad islature, provided that the school district did not levy a budget stabi\u00ad lization levy for tax year 2006. SECTION 4. The Superintendent of Public Instruction shall distrib\u00ad ute $3,771,300 of the moneys appropriated in Section 2 of this act to school districts, in like amounts as the moneys distributed in fiscal year 2006, pursuant to Section 63-3638(10), Idaho Code, for the replace\u00ad ment of school maintenance and operation levy funds. 970 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.326 2007 SECTION 5. It is the finding of the Legislature that House Bill No. 1, enacted by the First Extraordinary Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legislature, exposed the previously unrecognized lack of equalization of moneys provided to school districts for the replacement of school main\u00ad tenance and operation levies on agricultural equipment. Prior to House Bill No. 1, school districts received such unequalized funds, in highly varied amounts based, not on the size or needs of the school district, but on the amount of agricultural equipment contained therein. As was constitutionally appropriate, House Bill No. 1 dealt solely with the state replacement of equalized funds. However, many school districts, particularly those in which the local economy is based on agriculture, have grown dependent on these extra, unequalized funds. In addition, school districts had already set fiscal year 2007 budgets based on the assumption of receiving these funds, prior to the passage of House Bill No. 1. The immediate removal of such moneys would have a negative and destabilzing effect on many school district budgets. Since House Bill No. 1 provided an additional $100,000,000 to the Public Education Stabilization Fund for the express purpose of providing stability in public school budgets, it is legisla\u00ad tive intent to provide for the schedule of distributions, pursuant to this section, with appropriations from the Public Education Stabiliza\u00ad tion Fund. Pursuant to the Legislature's responsibility to maintain a constitu\u00ad tionally uniform system of public school funding, it is legislat ive intent that the school maintenance and operation levy-related portion of state replacement funding provided in lieu of personal property taxes on agricultural equipment be phased out according to the following 2007.

Each district shall be entitled to a salary-based apportionment calculated as provided in this section. 1.To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible district certificated instructional employees on the state\u00ad wide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting aver\u00ad age is the district index. Districts with an index above the state aver\u00ad age index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the 1994-95 school year, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .06 for the 1995-96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district instructional staff index shall be multiplied by the instructional base salary of $23,906. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff c.350 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1029 determined as provided in section 33-1004 2,, Idaho Code. The instruc\u00ad tional salary allocation shall be increased by the amount necessary for each full-time equivalent instructional staff member placed on the expe\u00ad rience and education index to be allocated at least the minimum saiary mandated by this section, Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and sub\u00ad mitted to the state department of education.

For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase as master teacher shall be those who have been recognized as national board certified teachers as of July 1 of each year. 2.To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the school year 1994-95, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average index plus .06 for the 1995-96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district administrative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of $34,TT335,816. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33-1004 3., Idaho Code, The resulting amount is the district's salary-based apportionment for admin\u00ad istrative staff. 3.To determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply $19,207 by the district classified staff allowance determined as pro\u00ad vided in section 33-1004 4,, Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's apportionment for classified staff, 4.The district's salary-based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections 1., 2. and 3,, of this sec\u00ad tion, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33-1004F, Idaho Code, SECTION 6, That Section 33-1009, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33-1009.

Deficits in the transfer of the appropriated amount of general account revenue to the public school income fund shall be reduced by the amount, if any, that the total amount receipted from other sources into the public school income fund exceeds the official estimated amount from those sources. The official estimate of receipts from other sources shall be the total amount stated by the legislature in the appropriation bill. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any transfers to or from the public educa\u00ad tion stabilization fund. 5. Any apportionments in any year, made to any school district, which may within the succeeding three (3) year period be found to have been in error either of computation or transmittal, may be corrected during the three (3) year period by reduction of apportionments to any school district to which over-apportionments may have been made or received, and corresponding additions to apportionments to any school district to which under-apportionments may have been made or received.

Such funds shall be expended for the purchase of technology equipment and software. SECTION 5. Of the moneys appropriated in Section 3 of this act, the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall distribute $3,017,000 to school districts, allocated according to the same proportions as the moneys distributed in fiscal year 2006, pursuant to Section 63-3638( 10), Idaho Code, for the replacement of school maintenance and operations levy funds. SECTION 6. Of the moneys appropriated in Section 3 of this act, $9,950,000 shall be distributed for the purchase of instructional soft\u00ad ware and textbooks, whether physical or electronic.

SECTION 8. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 33-1018, Idaho Code, it is estimated that the appropriation of state funds to the Edu\u00ad cational Support Program/Division of Operations will result in total discretionary funds of $25,442 per support unit. The Legislature recog\u00ad nizes that this figure does not reflect additional discretionary funds that will be made available through interest earnings at the local level as a result of this appropriation and the state's replacement of mainte\u00ad nance and operations levy funds. On a statewide basis, the maintenance and operations levy replacement will result in approximately $4.2 mil\u00ad lion in additional interest earnings, while the amendment of Section 33-1009, Idaho Code, will result in approximately $6.75 million in addi\u00ad tional interest earnings, for a total of $10.95 million. This represents an additional 3.1% increase in the amount of discretionary funds per support unit that will actually be available at the local level. In addition, this appropriation provides $20.13 million in new line item funding for classroom supplies, textbooks and remedial education. For school districts and public charter schools that currently expend discretionary funds for these items, which were not previously funded by the state, those moneys may now be freed up for other uses. In cases where the new state funds fully supplant existing local discretionary efforts, this will result in an additional 5.8% increase in the amount c.352 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1039 of discretionary funds per support unit that will actually be available at the local level, for a total increase of 8.9%, when added to the additional interest earnings. It is the intent of the Legislature that the Superintendent of Pub\u00ad lic Instruction and the Legislature understand the uses of and demands for discretionary funds. Inasmuch as significant discretionary funds were previously used for classroom supplies, textbooks and remediation, school districts and public charter schools are hereby requested to report to the Superintendent of Public Instruction the actual uses of discretionary funds for fiscal year 2007, and the budgeted uses for fis\u00ad cal year 2008. SECTION 9. That Section 33-1004E, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33-1004E. DISTRICT'S SALARY-BASED APPORTIONMENT. Each district shall be entitled to a salary-based apportionment calculated as provided in this section. 1.To determine the apportionment for instructional staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible district certificated instructional employees on the state\u00ad wide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting aver\u00ad age is the district index. Districts with an index above the state aver\u00ad age index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the 1994-95 school year, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .06 for the 1995-96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district instructional staff index shall be multiplied by the instructional base salary of $23,906. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for instructional staff determined as provided in section 33-1004 2., Idaho Code. The instruc\u00ad tional salary allocation shall be increased by the amount necessary for each full-time equivalent instructional staff member placed on the expe\u00ad rience and education index to be allocated at least the minimum salary mandated by this section. Full-time instructional staff salaries shall be determined from a salary schedule developed by each district and sub\u00ad mitted to the state department of education. No full-time instructional staff member shall be paid less than $30,000. If an instructional staff member has been certified by the national board for professional teach\u00ad ing standards, the staff member shall be designated as a master teacher and receive $2,000 per year for five (5) years. The instructional salary shall be increased by $2,000 for each master teacher. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based apportionment for instructional staff. For purposes of this section, teachers qualifying for the salary increase as master teacher shall be those who have been recognized as national board certified teachers as of July 1 of each year. 2.To determine the apportionment for district administrative staff, first determine the district average experience and education index by placing all eligible certificated administrative employees on the statewide index provided in section 33-1004A, Idaho Code. The resulting average is the district index. Districts with an index above the state average index shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average plus .03 for the school year 1994-95, and shall receive their actual index but not more than the state average index 1040 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.352 2007 plus .06 for the 1995-96 school year, and thereafter shall receive their actual district index. The district administrative staff index shall be multiplied by the base salary of $34,773. The amount so determined shall be multiplied by the district staff allowance for administrative staff determined as provided in section 33-1004 3., Idaho Code. The resulting amount is the district's salary-based apportionment for administrative staff. 3.To determine the apportionment for classified staff, multiply $i9,29T19,783 by the district classified staff allowance determined as provided in section 33-1004 4., Idaho Code. The amount so determined is the district's apportionment for classified staff. 4.The district's salary-based apportionment shall be the sum of the apportionments calculated in subsections 1., 2. and 3., of this sec\u00ad tion, plus the benefit apportionment as provided in section 33-1004F, Idaho Code. SECTION 10. That Section 33-1006, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended to read as follows: 33-1006. TRANSPORTATION SUPPORT PROGRAM. (1) The state board of education shall determine what costs of transporting pupils, including maintenance, operation and depreciation of basic vehicles, insurance, payments under contract with other public transportation providers whose vehicles used to transport pupils comply with federal transit adminis\u00ad tration regulations, \"bus testing,\" 49 C.F.R. part 665, and any revision thereto, as provided in subsection (4}(d) of this section, or other state department of education approved private transportation providers, salaries of drivers, and any other costs, shall be allowable in comput\u00ad ing the transportation support program of school districts. (2)Any costs associated with the addition of vehicle features that are not part of the basic vehicle shall not be allowable in computing the transportation support program of school districts. A basic vehicle is hereby defined as the cost of the vehicle without optional features, plus the addition of essential safety features and features necessary for the transportation of pupils with disabilities. (3)Each school district shall maintain records and make reports as are required for the purposes of this section. (4)The transportation support program of a school district shall be based upon the allowable costs of: (a)Transporting public school pupils one and one-half (1 1/2) miles or more to school; (b)Transporting pupils less than one and one-half (1 1/2) miles as provided in section 33-1501, Idaho Code, when approved by the state board of education; (c)The costs of payments when transportation is not furnished, as provided in section 33-1503, Idaho Code; (d)The transportation program for grades six (6) through twelve (12), upon the costs of payments pursuant to a contract with other public or private transportation providers entered into as provided in section 33-1510, Idaho Code, if the school district establishes that the reimbursable costs of transportation under the contract are equal to or less than the costs for school buses;c.352 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1041 (e)The costs of providing transportation to and from approved school activ ities as may be approved by rules of the state board of education; (f)The employer's share of contributions to the public employee retirement system and to social security. (5)The state's share of the transportation support program shall be eighty-five percent (85%) of reimbursable transportation costs of the district incurred during the inmediately preceding state fiscal year, provided the reimbursable costs do not exceed one hundred three percen t (103%) of the statewide average reimbursable cost per mile or the state average reimbursable cost per student rider, whichever is more advan ta\u00ad geous to the school district. If a school district's costs exceed the one hundred three percent (103%) limit when compu ted by the more advan\u00ad tageous of the two (2) methods, that school district shall be reimbursed at eighty-five percent (85%) of the maximum limit for whichever method is more favorable to the school district. A school district may appeal the applica tion of the one hundred three percent (103%) limit on reim\u00ad bursable costs to the state board of education, which may establish for that district a new percentile limit for reimbursable costs compared to the statewide average, which is higher than one hundred three percen t (103%). In doing so, the state board of education may set a new limit that is greater than one hundred three percent (103%), but is less than the percentile limit requested by the school district. However, the per\u00ad centage increase in the one hundred three percent (103%) cap shall not exceed the percentage of the district's bus runs that qualify as a hard\u00ad ship bus run, pursuant to this subsection. Any costs above the new level established by the state board of educat ion shall not be reimbursed. Such a change shall only be granted by the state board of education bus runs. To qualify as a hardship bus run, such bus run shall display uniquely difficult geographic circumstances and meet at least two (2) of the following cri\u00ad teria: s _,(-=a'-\")_..cTh-\"i'-\"e--\"'n'i'um=b'--'e\"'r--=o..cfc.,....cscctccuccd:..::ec.on:..::tc......::r..ci:..::d:..::e:..::r..cs'--\"p'\"\"'e:..::rc......::mc=i:..::l:..::e:......:i:..::s:......:l:..::e:..::s:..::s:......:t:..::hcc:an=.:=..--=f:..::i:..cf:..::t'\"\"y'--_.p'\"'e:..::r'-\u00ad (50%) of the statewide average number of student riders per cent mile; (b) Less than a majority of the miles on the bus run are by paved surface, concrete or asphalt, road; (c)Over ten percent (10%) of the miles driven on the bus run are a five percent (5%) slope or greater. The legislative audits section of the legislative services office shall review cap increases granted by the state board of education pursuant to this section, and shall include findings in the board's regular audit report for any instances in which such increases failed to meet the standards set forth in this subsection. (6)School districts that are unable to absorb the impact of the limitation on reimbursable expenses, through either efficiencies or the utilization of fund balances, may apply to the state board of education to receive a loan of moneys, not to exceed the amoun t of state funds 1042 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.353 2007 lost through the application of the limitation on reimbursable expenses, from the public education stabilization fund. Any school district receiving such a loan shall cause its reimbursement of state transporta\u00ad tion moneys to be reduced by a like amount in the subsequent fiscal year, and the moneys so reduced shall be deposited in the public educa\u00ad tion stabilization fund. (7)Beginning on July 1, 2005, any eligible home-based public vir\u00ad tual school may claim transportation reimbursement for the prior fiscal year's cost of providing educational services to students. In order to be eligible, such a school shall have at least one (1) average daily attendance divisor, pursuant to section 33-1002, Idaho Code, that is greater than the median divisor shown for any category of pupils, among the actual divisors listed. For the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c)of this subsection (7), \"education provider\" means the home-based public virtual school or an entity that has legally contracted with the home-based public virtual school to supply education services. Reimburs\u00ad able costs shall be limited to the costs of: (a)Providing an internet connection service between the student and the education provider, not including the cost of telephone ser\u00ad vice; (b)Providing electronic and computer equipment used by the student to transmit educational material between the student and the educa\u00ad tion provider; (c)Providing a toll-free telephone service provider; representa\u00ad tives public virtual school, with such reimburse\u00ad ments limited to the mileage costs set for state employee travel by the state board of examiners; and (e)Any actual pupil transportation costs that would be reimburs\u00ad able if claimed by a school district. The total reimbursement for such home-based public virtual schools shall be exempt from the statewide average cost per mile limitations of this section. The state's share of reimbursable costs shall be eighty-five percent (85%), subject to the statewide cost per student rider provi\u00ad sions of this section. For the purposes of such home-based public vir\u00ad tual school, the number of student riders shall be the same as the num\u00ad ber of pupils in average daily attendance. Approved April 2, 2007.

Divide educational support program distribution funds, after subtracting the amounts neces\u00ad sary to pay the obligations specified in subsection (2) of this section, by the total state support units to secure the state distribution factor per support unit. (6)District Support Units. The number of support units for each school district in the state shall be determined as follows: (a) (i) Divide the actual average daily attendance, excluding students approved for inclusion in the exceptional child educa\u00ad tional program, for the administrative schools and each of the separate schools and attendance units by the appropriate divi\u00ad sor from the tables of support units in this section, then add the quotients to obtain the district's support units allowance for regular students, kindergarten through grade 12 including alternative school secondary students. Calculations in applica\u00ad tion of this subsection shall be carried out to the nearest tenth. (ii)Divide the combined totals of the average daily atten\u00ad dance of all preschool, handicapped, kindergarten, elementary, secondary and juvenile detention center students approved for inclusion in the exceptional child program of the district by the appropriate divisor from the table for computation of exceptional education support units to obtain the number of support units allowed for the district's approved exceptional child program. Calculations for this subsection shall be car\u00ad ried out to the nearest tenth when more than one (1) unit is allowed. (iii) The total number of support units of the district shall be the sum of the total support units for regular students, subsection (6)(a)(i) of this section, and the support units allowance for the approved exceptional child program, subsec\u00ad tion (6)(a)(ii) of this section. (b)Total District Allowance Educational Program. Multiply the district's total number of support units, carried out to the nearest tenth, by the state distribution factor per support unit and to this product add the approved amount of programs of the district provided in subsection (2) of this section to secure the district's total allowance for the educational support program. (c) District Share. The district's share of state apportionment is the amount of the total district allowance, subsection (6)(b) of this section. (d)Adjustment of District Share. The contract salary of every non\u00ad certificated teacher shall be subtracted from the district's share as calculated from the provisions of subsection (6)(c) of this sec\u00ad tion. (7)Property Tax Computation Ratio. In order to receive state funds pursuant to this section a charter district shall utilize a school main\u00ad tenance and operation property tax computation ratio for the purpose of calculating its maintenance and operation levy, that is no greater than that which it utilized in tax year 1994, less four-tenths of one percent (.4%). As used herein, the term \"property tax computation ratio\" shall c.353 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1049 mean a ratio determined by dividing the district's certified property tax maintenance and operation budget by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values existed on December 31, 1993. Such maintenance and operation levy shall be based on the property tax computation ratio multiplied by the actual or adjusted market value for assessment purposes as such values existed on December 31 of the prior calendar year. SECTION 12. That Chapter 10, Title 33, Idaho Code, be, and the same is hereby amended by the addition thereto of a NEW SECTION, to be known and designated as Section 33-1020, Idaho Code, and to read as follows: 33-1020. IDAHO DIGITAL LEARNING ACADEMY FUNDING. Of the moneys appropriated for the educational support program, an amount shall be distributed to support the Idaho digital learning academy, created pur\u00ad suant to chapter 55, title 33, Idaho Code. For the purposes of this sec\u00ad tion, an \"enrollment\" shall be counted each time an Idaho school age child enrolls in an Idaho digital learning academy class. A single child enrolled in multiple classes shall count as multiple enrollments. Summer enrollments shall be included in the fiscal year that begins that sum\u00ad mer. The amount distributed shall be calculated as follows: (1)A fixed base amount shall be distributed, equal to the current fiscal year's statewide average salary-based apportionment funding per midterm support unit, multiplied by seven (7). (2)A variable base amount shall be distributed each time the num\u00ad ber of enrollments meets or exceeds an increment of five thousand (5,000). The amount so distributed shall be equal to the number of such increments, multiplied by the current fiscal year's statewide average salary-based apportionment funding per midterm support unit, multiplied by four and thirty-three hundredths (4.33). (3)A variable amount shall be distributed, equal to the number of enrollments multiplied by the current fiscal year's statewide average salary-based apportionment funding per midterm support unit, divided by one hundred forty-three (143).

Be It Enacted by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: SECTION 1. The Idaho Legislature hereby approves bonding authority for the issuance of highway transportation (GARVEE) bonds by the Idaho Housing and Finance Association in a principal amount sufficient to finance the highway transportation projects listed in Section 2 of this act in an amount up to $250,000,000. Such bonds are expected to be paid from continuing appropriations of federal funds from the State Highway Account as provided in Section 40-707, Idaho Code. SECTION 2. The Legislature finds that the bonding authority pro\u00ad vided in Section 1 of this act shall be used in a manner that does not obligate future legislatures or governors for additional bonding author\u00ad ity. The bonding authorized in Section 1 of this act shall be used to finance the following projects and the Idaho Transportation Board shall allocate bond revenue to the projects listed with such revenue alloca\u00ad tion falling within the range provided in this section: (1) US-95 (2) US-95 (3) COUNTY JUNCTION I-84 TO EMMETT CALDWELL TO MERIDIAN ORCHARD TO ISAACS CANYON MCCAMMON TO LAVA HOT Range $23,000,000 $11, SPRINGS $38,387, 000 $ 40,000,00 0 In no event shall the Idaho Transportation Board's bond revenue alloca\u00ad tion for the projects listed in this section exceed the bonding amount authorized in Section 1 of this act. 1094 IDAHO SESSION LAWS c.363 2007 SECTION 3. The Idaho Transportation Board and the Idaho Transporta\u00ad tion Department are hereby directed to not increase the scope, nor add specific projects, nor in any manner extend or enlarge the transporta\u00ad tion projects listed in Section 2 of this act. SECTION 4. To the extent the Idaho Transportation Board and the Idaho Transportation Department determine that GARVEE program management services are necessary, any agreement governing such services shall, to the extent possible, be fully transpar ent to the public and to the Leg\u00ad islature. SECTION 5. The bonds issued under the authority provided in Section 1 of this act shall be issued upon an approved resolution by the Idaho Transportation Board requesting the Idaho Housing and Finance Associa\u00ad tion to issue bonds in amounts necessary to ensure that: the funds are necessary to meet program obligation requirements; the funds will be used and disbursed in accordance with United States Treasury regulations to ensure tax exempt status is retained; and the bonds are issued at prevailing market rates of interest. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that the bonds authorized by the authority provided in Sec\u00ad tion 1 of this act be issued on an \"as needed\" basis as determined by the Idaho Transportation Board in an amount approximately, but not man\u00ad datorily, one-half (1/2) the total amount authorized. The purpose of this intent is to delay debt service on additional bonding until funds need to be obligated to pay for right-of-way acquisition, construction, and/or other necessary project-related costs and to avoid violation of arbitrage rules that may result from issuance of bonds too far in advance of the need to obligate for expenditure. It is also the request of the Legislature that the obligation of previously issued bonds be the signal for an additional issuance, with such issuance dependent upon advantageous market rates and costs of bonding transactions. SECTION 6. It is legislative intent that the Idaho Transportation Board direct the use of the revenue raised from the bonding authority provided in Section 1 of this act in such a manner that revenue shall be expended in a priority fashion and that the first priority of expendi\u00ad tures shall be for construction, followed in order of priority by expen\u00ad ditures for right-of-way acquisition, followed in priority by other nec\u00ad essary project-related costs. SECTION 7. Relating to the projects referenced in Section 2 of this act, it is legislative intent that, to the extent feasible and practi\u00ad cal, the Idaho Transportation Department perform project-related work within the department itself. The goal of this directive is to preserve the expenditure of GARVEE funds for the priorities described in Section 6 of this act. SECTION 8. It is legislative intent that the Idaho Transportation Board has the authority to adjust GARVEE bond proceeds allocated among the projects as listed in Section 2 of this act, provided that such an adjustment is necessary due to unanticipated reasons or circumstances or to accomnodate federally approved alternative and innovative approaches c.363 2007 IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1095 to the overall project development process; and provided further, that no proceeds shall be used for any projects not listed in Section 2 of this act. SECTION 9. The Idaho Transportation Board is hereby authorized to transfer up to $7,000,000 from within the State Highway Account to the GARVEE Debt Service Fund to pay the state match as required for federal funds conmitted to pay the annual scheduled debt service on GARVEE bonds for fiscal year 2008. SECTION 10. Notwithstanding any other prov1s1on of law, it is leg\u00ad islative intent that by September 30 of each year, the board shall sub\u00ad mit a report to the Legislature concerning projects currently under con\u00ad struction using the bond financing as authorized by the provisions of this act, and shall include a list of planned highway transportation projects to be financed with such bond financing during the next suc\u00ad ceeding fiscal year. SECTION 11. The bonds described herein shall be issued no later than June 30, 2008. SECTION 12. On and after July 1, 2008, all allocations of GARVEE bond proceeds shall be the sole responsibility and duty of the Idaho Transportation Board. The Legislature shall have authority to approve a total GARVEE bond amount on an annual basis. However, for fiscal year 2008 the Idaho Transportation Board is directed to allocate bond revenue only among the projects listed in Section 2, Chapter 457, Laws of 2006. In making its funding allocation for projects, the board shall take into consideration: the cost of the project and whether or not that project could be financed without bonding; whether the project is necessary to facilitate the traffic flow on vital transportation corridors; and whether the project is necessary to improve safety for the traveling public. On and after July 1, 2008, the board shall use due care in selecting projects for bonding and shall balance and coordinate the use of bonding with the use of highway construction moneys. SECTION 13.

IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1111 We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, bipartisan legislation sponsored by U.S. Senators Larry Craig and Ron Wyden has financially assisted counties with large tracts of federal timberland within the county boundaries; and WHEREAS, the Craig-Wyden bill set annual payments to counties with large tracts of federal timberland, providing crucial funding for schools and roads and providing millions of dollars for a variety of natural resource conservation projects from weed control to bridge replacements, from thinning forests to trail building; and WHEREAS, the Craig-Wyden bill's reauthorization is necessary to help rural counties with timberlands plan and maintain their transportation infrastr ucture; and WHEREAS, certain counties of Idaho are hamstrung in their ability to collect property taxes by a supermajority of federal land ownership within their boundaries; and WHEREAS, if the Craig-Wy den bill is not reauthorized, it will have little effect on the federal budget but could devastate timber counties and towns in the Northwest and Idaho; and WHEREAS, more than fifty percent of the Idaho Panhandle is owned by the federal government and counties cannot collect property tax on fed\u00ad eral lands to support schools and to build and maintain roads; and WHEREAS, it is crucial in tight economic times that the U.S. govern\u00ad ment meet its obligation to the counties; WHEREAS, in some counties the reauthorization of the Craig-Wyden bill means the difference between $22,000 and $1,080,000 in support for schools and roads; and WHEREAS, in other counties, failure to reauthorize the Craig-Wyden bill means the per capita loss of $235 in support. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that we support reauthorization of the \"Secure Rural Schools and Col!JDunity Self-Determination Act\" or the enactment of its equitable equivalent by the Congress of the United States and we request the President of the United States to support this effort.

We, your Memorialists, the Senate and the House of Representatives of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, it is in the best interests of Idaho individually and the United States as a whole to embrace an energy policy that encompasses a diverse array of sources so as to avoid economic dislocations associated with undue reliance on any single domestic or foreign energy source, while also accommodating carbon management concerns; and WHEREAS, it is the formal policy of the United States of America, as delineated in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, to include nuclear power in the nation's diverse energy portfolio; and WHEREAS, much of the developing world has already begun an ambitious effort to expand the use of noncarbon emitting nuclear power to supply its rapidly escalating demand for reliable baseload electricity; and WHEREAS, the President of the United States and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) have determined that this country's national interests are best served by creating an orderly international framework and technology basis to guide the accelerating global expansion of nuclear energy; and WHEREAS, this new framework is embodied in the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), which seeks to establish an internationa l approach to extend the benefits of abundant nuclear-generated electricity to both the developed and developing worlds, get the most energy possible from one of nature's most energy-dense power sources, create a final waste form requiring management attention for a more limited amount of time, and greatly decrease the potential for misuse of used nuclear fuel; and WHEREAS, the United States DOE has asked communities and states to help identify possible sites wherein the enabling technologies behind the full realization of GNEP can be thoroughly examined and proven; and WHEREAS, conmunity leaders in eastern Idaho have come together to identify sites in response to the DOE's request for help, realizing no other state in the nation has the proud nuclear legacy of Idaho, where usable electricity from the atom was first generated, breeder technology was first proven, lifesaving medical and industrial isotopes can and have been produced and fifty-two remarkable nuclear reactors were designed and built; and WHEREAS, the long-standing partnership between Idaho and the federal government has resulted in countless improvements in the design and safety performance of both commercial and military nuclear power sys\u00ad tems, as well as the cost-effective and DOE-complex leading performance of environmental cleanup activities as prescribed by a detailed, yet accommodative 1995 agreement that ensures our state's environme nt is protected now and would continue to be protected with any future proj\u00ad ects. IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1113 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the Senate and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Idaho supports the goals of the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership and encourages this administra\u00ad tion, the United States Congress and the Department of Energy to commit and provide the funding necessary to complete the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership initiative which is critical to the long-term well-being of the United States and to concur that Idaho is the most suitable and pre\u00ad ferred site for the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership and other advanced nuclear and energy security research.

We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Moderniza\u00ad tion Act of 2003 (MMA) was designed to deliver a federal pharmacy bene\u00ad fit to Medicare beneficiaries. It was also designed to ease state Medic\u00ad aid programs of their responsibilities for providing pharmacy benefits to those dually eligible for both the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and WHEREAS, although the clear congressional intent was to ease the fiscal burden on states, the Phased-Down State Contribution, also known as the \"clawback,\" will actually cause the state of Idaho to expend more moneys in Medicaid than it would have in the absence of the MMA; and WHEREAS, while the federal formula used calendar year 2003 as the base year and applies an annual national inflation in the costs of the Phased-Down State Contribution, it fails to account for Idaho's current and future efforts to curtail prescription drug costs; and WHEREAS, the state of Idaho has, since the base year of 2003, engaged in multiple efforts to curtail spending on Medicaid prescription drug costs, including enhancements to the state Medicaid Allowable Cost program, initiation of a supplemental federal rebate program, participa\u00ad tion in a multistate purchasing pool, The Optimal Preferred Drug List or \"TOP$,\" and implementation of a Mental Health Pharmacy Management Ini\u00ad tiative to improve prescribing practices of Idaho Medicaid providers prescribing mental health drugs; and WHEREAS, during the base calendar year of 2003, Idaho's rebate per\u00ad centage was 21% and is used in the base of the Phased-Down State Contri\u00ad bution calculation, the actual rebate percentages in state fiscal years 2005 and 2006 were 27.07% and 32.59%, respectively. This gain in effi\u00ad ciency, which represents a reduction in net cost, is not accounted for in the Phased-Down State Contribution calculation. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representa-IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1115 tives and the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of Idaho respectfully requests the Secretary of Health and Human Services to amend, if not eliminate, the Phased-Down State Contribution since it has created an additional fiscal burden upon the state of Idaho.

We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, the state of Idaho recognizes the Constitution of the United States as our charter of liberty and the Bill of Rights as affirming the fundamental and inalienable rights of Americans, including freedom of privacy and freedom from unreason able searches; and WHEREAS, Idaho has a diverse population whose contributions are vital to the state's economy, culture and civic character; and WHEREAS, Idaho is proud of its tradition of protecting the civil rights and liberties of all its residents, affirming the fundamental rights of all people and providing more expansive protections than are granted by the Constitution of the United States; and WHEREAS, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-13, creates a national identification card by mandating federal standards for state driver's licenses and identification cards and requires states to share their motor vehicle databases; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act mandates the documents that states must require to issue driver's licenses and requires states to place uniform information on every driver's license in a standard, machine-re adable format; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act prohibits federal agencies and federally\u00ad regulated commercial aircraft from accepting a driver's license or iden\u00ad tification card issued by a state that has not fully complied with the act; and IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1117 WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act places a costly, unfunded mandate on states, with initial estimates for Idaho of more than thirty-nine mil\u00ad lion dollars with ongoing annual expenses of an estimated nine million three hundred thousand dollars and a national estimate of more than eleven billion dollars over the next five years; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act requires the creation of a massive public sector database containing information on every American that is acces\u00ad sible to all motor vehicle employees and law enforcement officers nationwide and that can be used to gather and manage information on cit\u00ad izens. Such activities are not the business or responsibility of govern\u00ad ment; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act enables the creation of additional massive private sector databases, combining both transactional information and driver's license information gained from scanning the machine-readable information contained on every driver's license; and WHEREAS, these public and private databases are likely to contain numerous errors and false information, creating significant hardship for Americans attempting to verify their identities in order to travel on commercial aircraft, open a bank account or perform any of the numerous functions required to live in the United States today; and WHEREAS, the federal trade conmission estimates that ten million Americans are victims of identity theft annually, and because identity thieves are increasingly targeting motor vehicle departments, the REAL ID Act will enable the crime of identity theft by making the personal information of all Americans, including date of birth and signature, accessible from tens of thousands of locations; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act requires a driver's license to contain a person's actual home address and makes no exception for individuals in potential danger, such as undercover law enforcement personnel or vic\u00ad tims of stalking or criminal harassment; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act contains onerous record verification and retention provisions that place unreasonable burdens on the motor vehi\u00ad cle division and on third parties required to verify records; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act will place enormous burdens on consumers seeking new driver's licenses, such as longer lines, increased document requests, higher costs and a waiting period; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act will place state motor vehicle staff on the front lines of immigration enforcement by forcing state employees to determine federal citizenship and inunigration status, excessively burdening both foreign-born applicants and motor vehicle staff; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act passed without sufficient deliberation by Congress and did not receive a hearing by any congressional committee or a vote solely on its own merits, despite opposition from more than six hundred organizations; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act eliminated a process of negotiated rulemak\u00ad ing initiated under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which had convened federal, state and local policymakers, pri\u00ad vacy advocates and industry experts to solve the problem of the misuse of identity documents; and WHEREAS, the REAL ID Act provides little security benefit and leaves identification systems open to insider fraud, counterfeit documentation and database failures. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representa-1118 IDAHO SESSION LAWS tives and the Senate concurring therein, that we support the government of the United States in its campaign to secure our country, while affirming the conmitment of the United States that this campaign not be waged at the expense of the essential civil rights and liberties of the citizens of this country.

BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Idaho Legislature urges the Idaho congressional delegation to support measures to repeal the REAL ID Act. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the United States George w.

No. 4) A JOINT MEMORIAL TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES IN CON\u00ad GRESS ASSEMBLED, TO THE CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING THE STATE OF IDAHO IN THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES AND TO THE LEG\u00ad ISLATURES OF THE STATES OF ALASKA, ARIZONA, CALIFORNIA, COLORADO, HAWAII, MONTANA, NEVADA, NEW MEXICO, OREGON, UTAH, WASHINGTON AND WYOMING. We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, it has long been the intent and policy of the federal gov\u00ad ernment to hold rural communities harmless from the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Conmittee on Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands could create hardship for many counties as they provided little revenue or commerce at that time; and WHEREAS, in 1908, the federal government promised rural counties twenty-five percent of all revenues generated from the multiple-use man\u00ad agement of the newly created national forests to support public roads and public schools; and IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1119 WHEREAS, in recent decades, the forest resources have not been man\u00ad aged in a manner to produce long-term sustainable revenue to share with schools and counties; and WHEREAS, in 2000, Congress passed Public Law 106-393, the Secure Rural Schools and Conmunity Self-Det ermination Act. The Act restored historical payment levels previously made to states and counties from the federal government for road and school purposes because of declining levels of actual forest receipts; and WHEREAS, the reauthorization and appropriation of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Dete rmination Act is pending before the United States Congress, and Idaho counties are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully funded approval of this Act; and WHEREAS, federal land managers continue to be faced with funding shortages. In the event the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self\u00ad Determination Act is not reauthorized and appropri ated, counties will be faced with higher property taxes or a reduction in services and, even if the Act is reauthorized and appropriated, it will likely be the last time, and the state of Idaho must seek a long-term solution; and WHEREAS, in 2006, House Joint Memorial No. 21 was adopted by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legisla\u00ad ture to provide one option to address the problem of declining forest receipts by urging Congress to support federal legislation transferring management of National Forest System lands within Idaho to the state of Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural counties and schools; and WHEREAS, in February 2007, a concurrent resolution was introduced in the Idaho House of Represent atives and will be voted on by the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature authorizing Idaho's Legislative Council to appoint an interim committee to undertake and complete an assessment of the decline in receipts on National Forest System lands, which have historically been shared with counties. The goal of the interim committee's recommendations will be to develop a federal, bipartisan, long-term solution that addresses sustainable man\u00ad agement of federal forest lands to stabilize payments to Idaho's forest counties, which help support roads and schools, and to provide projects that enhance forest ecosystem health, provide employment opportunities, and improve cooperative relationships among those who use and care about the lands the federal government manages. The resolution calls for the interim committee to work in cooperation and coordination with the state of Idaho, its counties, its school and highway districts, along with the recognized Indian tribes of the state of Idaho. The resolution also pro\u00ad vides that the interim committee address National Forest System lands, but only those lands that do not have special designations. The interim committee is directed to formulate a solution that will protect all valid existing rights, existing public access and activities, including hunting, fishing and recreation, and that will not be construed to interfere with treaties or any other obligations to the Indian tribes, commitments to county governments, or the General Mining Law or Taylor Grazing Act. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representa\u00ad tives and the Senate concurring therein, that the legislatures of all western states should consider the adoption of similar resolutions, working toward the development of a federal, bipartisan, long-term solu-1120 IDAHO SESSION LAWS tion that addresses sustainable management of federal forest lands to stabilize payments to forest counties throughout the western United States, which help support roads and schools, and to provide projects that enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment opportuni\u00ad ties, and to improve cooperative relationships among those who use and care about the lands the federal government manages. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, the congressional delegation rep\u00ad resenting the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States and to the Legislatures of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

We, your Memorialists, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the State of Idaho assembled in the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, do hereby respectfully represent that: WHEREAS, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Com\u00ad merce and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security participated in the formation of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America {SPP) on March 23, 2005, representing a trilateral agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States designed, among other things, to facilitate common regulatory schemes between these countries; and WHEREAS, reports issued by the SPP indicate that it has implemented regulatory changes among the three countries that circumvent United States trade, transportation, homeland security and border security functions and that it is the intention of SPP to continue toward a North American Union in the future; and WHEREAS, the actions taken by the SPP to coordinate border security by eliminating obstacles to migration between Mexico and the United States actually makes the United States-Mexico border less secure and more vulnerable to possible terrorist activities, and Mexico is the pri\u00ad mary source country of illegal inmigrants, illegal drug entry and ille\u00ad gal human smuggling into the United States; and WHEREAS, according to the U.S. Department of Conmerce, the United States trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have significantly increased since the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement {NAFTA), and the volume of imports from Mexico has soared since NAFTA, straining security checks at the U.S. border; and WHEREAS, the economic and physical security of the United States is IDAHO SESSION LAWS 1121 impaired by the potential loss of control of its borders attendant to the full operation of NAFTA and the SPP; and WHEREAS, the regulatory and border security changes implemented and proposed by the SPP violate and threaten United States sovereignty; and WHEREAS, the NAFTA Superhighway System from the west coast of Mexico through the United States and into Canada has been suggested as part of a North American Union to facilitate trade between the SPP countries; and WHEREAS, the stability and economic viability of the U.S. ports along the western coast will be seriously compromised by huge cargos off-loaded at cheaper labor cost from forei gn traders into the ports of Mazatlan and Lazaro Cardenas; and WHEREAS, the state of Texas has already approved and begun planning of the Trans-Texas Corridor, a major multi-modal transportation project beginning at the United States-Mexico border, which would serve as an initial section of the NAFTA Superhighway System; and WHEREAS, plans of Asian trading powers to divert cargo from U.S. ports such as Los Angeles to ports in Mexico will only put pressure on border inspectors, interfering with their already overwhelming job of intercepting the flow of drugs and illegals flowing into this country; and WHEREAS, future unrestricted foreign trucking into the United States can pose a safety hazard due to inadequate maintenance and inspection, and the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) lack of back\u00ad ground checks for violations in Mexico, lack of drug and alcohol test\u00ad ing, lack of enforcement of size and weight requirements and lack of national security procedures, which threaten the American people and undermine the very charge given to our homeland security agency to defend our borders against these threats; and WHEREAS, the Eisenhower National Highway System was designed for the national security of the United States for movement of the military, purposes of conmerce from state to state, not from foreign countries, and this highway system should not be compromised by treaties or agree\u00ad ments with other countries that would supplant the control and manage\u00ad ment of our nation's highways by our U.S. Department of Transportation and the various states; and WHEREAS, we strongly object to any treaty or agreement, which threatens to violate national security, private property, United States commerce, constitutional rights and American soverei gnty and emphasize our commitment to the Pacific Northwest Economic Region (PNWER) and other cooperative working nations in mutual beneficial goals; and WHEREAS, this trilateral partnership to develop a North American Union has never been presented to Congress as an agreement or treaty, and has had virtually no congressional oversight; and WHEREAS, recent reports on internet news, Friday, January 26, 2007, WorldNetDaily, stating that Congressman Poe (R-Texas) asked about the U.S. Department of Transportation's work with the trade group North American Super-Corridor Coalition, Inc. (NASCO) and the department's plans to build the Trans-Texas Corridor, Congressman Poe was told that the NAFTA agreement superhighway corridor plans exist to move goods from Mexico through the United States to Canada; and WHEREAS, American citizens and state and local governments through\u00ad out the United States would be negatively impacted by the SPP process. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular 1122 IDAHO SESSION LAWS Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representa\u00ad tives and the Senate concurring therein, that we emphatically urge and petition the Congress of the United States and particularly the congres\u00ad sional delegation representing the state of Idaho to use all efforts, energies and diligence to withdraw the United States from any further participation in the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North Amer\u00ad ica or any other bilateral or multilateral activity that seeks to advance, authorize, fund or in any way promote the creation of any structure to create any form of North American Union. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that House Concurrent Resolution 40 of the First Session of the llOth Congress addresses the concern herein expressed by the state of Idaho. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that we are asking our congressional delega\u00ad tion, our U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters and President Bush to reject appropriated federal fuel tax dollars for such SPP or NAFTA when there is such a need for fuel tax dollars to be dedi\u00ad cated to the needs of the states in the U.S. in order to maintain our highway system. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the Chief Clerk of the House of Repre\u00ad sentatives be, and she is hereby authorized and directed to forward a copy of this Memorial to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of Congress, and the congressional delega\u00ad tion representing the State of Idaho in the Congress of the United States.

Adopted by the House February 27, 2007 Adopted by the Senate March 9, 2007 (H.C.R. No. 26) A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION STATING FINDINGS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND AUTHORIZING THE LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL TO APPOINT A COMMITTEE TO UNDERTAKE AND COMPLETE A STUDY OF THE DECLINE IN RECEIPTS ON NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM LANDS. Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the State of Idaho: WHEREAS, it has long been the intent and policy of the federal gov\u00ad ernment to hold rural communities harmless from the creation of federal lands and in 1906 the Coomittee on Public Lands recognized that the presence of federal lands could create hardship for many counties as they provided little revenue or commerce at that time; and WHEREAS, in 1908, the federal government promised rural counties twenty-five percent of all revenues generated from the multiple-use man\u00ad agement of the newly created national forests to support public roads and public schools; and WHEREAS, in recent decades, the forest resources have not been man\u00ad aged in a manner to produce long-term sustainable revenue to share with schools and counties; and WHEREAS, in 2000, Congress passed Public Law 106-393, the Secure Rural Schools and Conmunity Self-Determination Act. The Act restored historical payment levels previously made to states and counties from the federal government for road and school purposes because of declining levels of actual forest receipts; and WHEREAS, the reauthorization and appropriation of the Secure Rural Schools and Conmunity Self-Deter mination Act is pending before the United States Congress, and Idaho counties are on record as being strongly supportive of a fully funded approval of this Act; and WHEREAS, federal land managers continue to be faced with funding shortages. In the event the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self\u00ad Determination Act is not reauthorized and appropriated, counties will be faced with higher property taxes or a reduction in services and, even if the Act is reauthorized and appropriated, it will likely be the last time, and the state of Idaho must seek a long-term solution; and WHEREAS, in 2006, House Joint Memorial No. 21 was adopted by the members of the Second Regular Session of the Fifty-eighth Idaho Legisla\u00ad ture to provide one option to address the problem of declining forest receipts by urging Congress to support federal legislation transferring 1158 IDAHO SESSION LAWS management of National Forest System lands within Idaho to the state of Idaho to be managed for the benefit of the rural counties and schools. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the members of the First Regular Session of the Fifty-ninth Idaho Legislature, the House of Representa\u00ad tives and the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislative Council is authorized to appoint an interim conmittee to undertake and complete an assessment of the decline in receipts on National Forest System lands, which have historically been shared with counties, with the goal of the interim conmittee's recommendations being to develop a federal, biparti\u00ad san, long-term solution that addresses sustainable management of federal forest lands to stabilize payments to Idaho's forest counties, which help support roads and schools, and to provide projects that enhance forest ecosystem health and provide employment opportuniti es, and to improve cooperative relationships among those who use and care about the lands the agencies manage. The Legislative Council shall determine the membership from each house appointed to the interim committee and shall authorize the interim committee to receive input, advice and assistance from interested and affected parties who are not members of the Legisla\u00ad ture. As much as is practicable, the interim committee shall work in cooperation and coordination with the state of Idaho, its counties, its school and highway districts, along with the recognized Indian tribes of the state of Idaho. The interim committee is also authorized to retain the services of consultants, within appropriated moneys, who are famil\u00ad iar with forest receipts, and who can provide necessary economic and other research to assist the interim committee and the Legislature in making an informed decision on this most important topic. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Idaho legislative interim conmittee on forest receipts will address National Forest System lands, but only those lands that do not have special designations. The interim committee is directed to formulate a solution that will protect all valid existing rights, existing public access and activities, including hunting, fishing and recreation, and that will not be con\u00ad strued to interfere with treaties or any other obligations to the Indian tribes, conmitments to county governments, or the General Mining Law or Taylor Grazing Act. NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that nonlegislative members of the interim committee may be appointed by the cochairs of the interim committee who are appointed by the Legislative Council.
