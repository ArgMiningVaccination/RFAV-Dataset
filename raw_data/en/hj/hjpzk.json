It is a randomized, controlled, open labelled study, comparing the effects of Tualang honey (TH) administration for six months at threedifferent doses: 20 g (THL), 40 g (THI) or 60 g (THH) daily compared with control (no administeredtreatment, THC). Only asymptomatic HIV positive subjects (n \u00bc95) having CD4 count 250-600 cell/ml, not on antiretrovirals were enrolled. Blood, (together with QOL questionnaires administration) were inves- tigated at baseline, three and six months (CD4 cell count) while VL was determined only at baseline andsix months. Signi cant reductions in CD4 counts in THL and THC groups (p \u00bc0.003 for both) were seen with no signi cant reductions in the CD4 counts in THI and THH groups (p \u00bc0.447 and 0.053 respec- tively). There was in VL in THC and THI (130% and 32% respectively) and reductions in THLand THH (26% and 8% respectively). Within and between group analyses for VL indicated signi cant differences between THL and THH compared to THC. In addition, signi cant improvement in QOL of groups which received TH was noted. TH has the potential to improve the QOL (physical and psycho-logical) and CD4 counts. There was a trend of lower VL in asymptomatic HIV subjects following THadministration thus supporting the possible role of TH in boosting the immune system by improving CD4 counts, causing VL reductions in HIV positive subjects. \u00a92018 Center for Food and Biomolecules, National Taiwan University.

Introduction Human Immunode ciency Virus (HIV) infection is reported to be among the top ten leading cause of death in the productive population in the world.1Based on the UNAIDS Fact Sheet 2017, there were 30.8 e42.9 million people living with HIV (PLHIV) in 2016, affecting women (52%) and children (6%) with approximately1.8 million people becoming newly infected with HIV yearly. In Malaysia, the situation is also similar with an estimated 108,519 PLHIV cases reported and 3330 new HIV cases detected by the end of 2015. Generally, PLHIV is predominant among Malaysian males (89%) but over time, the pattern is progressively shifted towards increasing infection rates in females with declining male to female ratio [from 9.6 (in 2000) to 5.5 (in 2015)].2 HIV infection is a chronic disease whose progression to acquired immune de ciency syndrome (AIDS) varies depending on the pa- tient's state of immunity.3The introduction of highly active anti- retroviral therapy (HAART) in 1996 which reduces morbidity and mortality, prolongs lives and improves quality of life (QOL) of*Corresponding author.

Nevertheless, to date, there is still no cure for HIV and AIDS, both of which require life-long adherence since treatment does not completely restore immune system integrity. Currently, the use of HAART is reported to increase the survival rate of PLHIV while its use is associated with reduced AIDS-de ning opportunistic infections as well as mortality which are directly related to immune suppression. In Malaysia, only selected PLHIV are administered with HAART. Based on the Malaysian Guideline for HIV, many factors should be considered before commencing patients on HAART including 1) having CD4 counts <350 cells/mm, 2) patients' willingness to start and adhere strictly to the treatment as well as during follow-up, 3) available antiretroviral options, 4) underlying medical diseases including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus, 5) the risk of primary resistance and 6) individual factors which may hinder adherence such as irregular working hours and lack of social sup- port.4The selection is done to ensure that patients on HAART are compliant to the medications and to avoid the risk of developing HIV resistant strains. Due to these reasons, only 28% of HIV patients was reported to be on HAART in Malaysia in 2015.2 HIV infection increases oxidative stress which can result in further oxidative damage.5The extent of the damage is in fluenced by both the amount of oxidative stress and the host defense mechanisms both of which may be affected by the intake of dietary and non-dietary antioxidants and the levels of antioxidant en- zymes. The activity of the latter may in turn be dependent on the intake of nutrients required for enzyme activity. In addition, low plasma selenium concentration during HIV infection is associated with low glutathione peroxidase activity.6Signicantly higher oxidative stress and lower concentrations of major plasma anti- oxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), beta-carotene (pro-vitamin A) and selenium have also been reported in patients compared to seronegative patients.7Low levels of antioxidant may hasten disease progression due to impaired defenses.8Therefore, in order to boost the defense sys- tem, many studies have been conducted on supplementation of PLHIV with micronutrients including the use of selenium, b-caro- tene9as as A10,11and E.11 Additionally, due to gastrointestinal malabsorption, increased metabolic demand, body redistribution, weight loss and muscle wasting, PLHIV are reported to be more prone to suffering from multi-nutrient de ciencies especially that of micronutrients.12 Therefore, some HIV patients have been reported to be de cient in important micronutrients including thiamine, selenium, zinc and B3, B6, B12, C, D and E.7,13Moreover, oxidative stress has been linked to a weakened antioxidant defense system7thus contributing to a decreased immunity, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as a higher risk of disease progression as well as mortality in PLHIV, indicating the need for the use of micronutrients. PLHIV are also at higher risk of developing non-AIDS conditions such as accelerated aging,14higher mortality, cardiovascular15and other in flammatory-related diseases16despite having low VL and high CD4 count17since low levels of residual viral replication contribute to residual immune activation and in flammation. Honey may be a good supplement for HIV patients. It contains at least 181 substances which include vitamins, minerals, trace elements, pro- teins, enzymes, amino acids and carbohydrates.18,19Honey also contains phenolic and flavonoids compounds19,20which are important antioxidants that can alleviate chronic in flammation and stimulate immune cells.21In addition, honey has antibacterial22 and anticancer properties.23Interestingly, the oligosaccharides present in honey has been reported to be rich in bi dobacteria and lactobacilli both of which can act as prebiotics to alleviatediarrhoea.24Honey also shortens the duration of bacterial gastro- enteritis attributed to its antibacterial properties.19Besides being rich in nutrients and antioxidants, honey provides energy where one tablespoon of honey can supply 64 calories of energy.18In addition, honey has anti-in flammatory properties25which can help quench the in flammatory effects of residual immune activation and inflammation. It is thus postulated that honey is an ideal supple- ment for HIV patients who are at risk of malnutrition, infection and cancers. Due to its strong antioxidant, anti-in flammatory effects and the ability to boost the immune system, it is hypothesized that honey can improve the immunity of HIV patients, their CD4 counts hence reducing VL in HIV-positive subjects. To our knowledge, the effects of honey on immunocompromised patients especially in HIV pos- itive subjects have not been investigated. Among the different types of honey present in Malaysia, Tualang honey has been reported to have a high antioxidant properties26which may help to improve the QOL of HIV patients. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the effects of Tualang honey on CD4 counts, the VL and the QOL in HIV positive subjects with a special focus on patients who were not given anti-retroviral (treatment na\u00efve) since thesegroup of individuals are also prone to opportunistic and other in- flammatory reactions. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Study subjects The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USMKK/PPP/JEPeM [198.3 (1)]) which complies with the were inmates from Pengkalan Chepa Kota Bharu, Kelantan, Malaysia diagnosed to be HIV positive with CD4 counts between 250 and 600 cells/ml and were not on HAART. Written informed consents were signed prior to enrollment. The enrolled subjects were mostly the unfortunate ones who do not meet the criteria for HAART due to their poor social support and dif culty to adhere to treatment and follow up. 2.2. Tualang honey Tualang honey (AgroMas, Malaysia) was supplied by the Federal Agriculture Marketing Authority (FAMA) of Malaysia. Honey was collected by an authorized honey collector and was transported to the laboratory at room temperature (30 /C14C). It was evaporated to achieve a 20% water content before being gamma irradiated at 20 Gy to ensure its sterility. It was individually packed in 20 g sachet each to help standardize the amount administered to all subjects. 2.3. Study design This is a randomized, controlled, open-labeled study on the ef- fects of Tualang honey administered at three different doses for six months ( Fig. 1 ). Inclusion criteria was PLHIV who were treatment na\u00efve with CD4 counts 250 e600 cell/ml. Exclusion criteria include AIDS de ning illness,27concurrent chronic diseases such as dia- betes mellitus, tuberculosis, chronic renal failure and chronic liver diseases. Demographic data and baseline investigations of CD4 count, VL and assessment of QOL were taken upon recruitment. Using a block randomization method, the subjects were randomly divided into four groups. Group THL was administered with honey 20 g daily (low dose), Group THI received 20 g of honey two times daily (40 g/day, intermediate dose), Group THH received 20 g of honey three times daily (40 g/day, high dose) while Group THC did not receive any treatment and served as a control (an acceptableW.N. Wan Yusuf et al. / Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine 9 (2019) 249 e256 250standard approach in the current management of HIV patient). To ensure compliance, honey was consumed with a glass of plain water under supervision of the prison guard, an hour before their main meals. All subjects (treatment and control groups) received similar food as their main meals since they were all inmates of the same prison which can help reduce inter-subject variability. The subjects were followed up after three and six months for the determination of CD4 levels and assessment of QOL. In addition, VL was determined at six months. CD4 count was determined by using an immuno fluorescence method (BD Multi-test IMK Kit CA, USA). The determination of VL was done using a COBAS\u00aeAmplicor HIV-1 Test (Roche Laboratories, CA, USA). The tests were performed in an ISO 15189 accredited laboratory. QOL was assessed using validated questionnaires which were adapted from WHOQOL HIV-BREF for the local population.27The questionnaire assessed six different domains; domain 1: physical wellbeing, domain 2: psychological, domain 3: level of indepen- dence, domain 4: social relationship, domain 5: environment anddomain 6: spirituality/religion/personal beliefs. 2.4. Sample size calculation Sample size was calculated using a G*Power software version 3.0.10 (Universitat Kiel, Germany). Based on the software (ANOVA: repeated measures, within-between interaction), the ideal sample size was determined as 76 (where awas 0.05, power 0.9 and effect size 0.20 with four groups and three repetitions conducted). Assuming a dropout rate of 20%, the calculated targeted sample size was 91. 2.5. Statistical analysis Data entry and statistical analysis were performed using a sta- tistical software package SPSS for Windows version 22.0 (IBM Corporation, USA). One-way ANOVA and Pearson Chi Squared tests were used to compare the means of each group for numerical and categorical data respectively. Factorial analysis of variance for Fig. 1. Study design.W.N. Wan Yusuf et al. / Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine 9 (2019) 249 e256 251repeated measurements (repeated measure ANOVA) was applied to investigate the differences in log VL and CD4 counts between the four groups. A two-sided p-value of less than 0.05 is considered as statistically signi cant. There were no p-values for repeated mea- sures ANOVA between group analyses, with regards to time. If the mean of the group is outside the con dence interval range of the compared group, then the difference is considered as statistically signicant. 3. Results Ninety- ve HIV-infected subjects were recruited where the majority (72.6%) were previous intravenous drug users. Most sub- jects were males (85.3%) and were unmarried (74.7%) ( Table 1 ). There was no signi cant difference in terms of the baseline data for age, weight, CD4 counts and log VL among the honey-treated groups as compared to the control indicating that the subjects were homogenous. This was as expected since block randomization was performed to ensure that the bias in subject selection is minimized. All groups had decreased CD4 absolute counts over the inves- tigated period ( Table 2 ). However, the reduction in the count was signicant only in groups THC (control group) and THL (low dose group). Nevertheless, there was no signi cant difference in mean CD4 count between all groups when repeated measures ANOVA between group analysis were performed [F-stat (df) \u00bc0.245,3p- value \u00bc0.864]. There was an increase in VL in groups THC and THI (by 130% and 31% respectively) but reductions in groups THL and THH (by 25% and 8% respectively) ( Table 3 ). There were trends of VL increment in control group and reduction in treatment group ( Fig. 2 ). However, the within group analysis were not statistically signi cant. When between group analysis was conducted, signi cant differences between groups THL and THH as compared to group THC were seen at six months of treatment ( Table 4 ). As for the QOL, there were signi cant difference in the scores for group THC (control group) in domains 1 (physical; p \u00bc0.045) and 2 (psychological; p \u00bc0.033) based on time ( Table 4 ). There was a signicant difference in the mean score of domains 1 and 2 be- tween the treatment groups and the control group at three and six months ( Table 5 ).Fig. 3 illustrates the reductions of the means score for domains 1 and 2 where the control group had signi cant re- ductions in the mean score as compared to the groups treated withhoney which showed improvement in the QOL score. 4. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the rst study to investigate on the effect of Tualang honey administration on CD4 count and QOL of HIV-positive subjects. The natural history of HIV infection in un- treated patients is decreased in CD4 cell counts and an increased VL where in the later stages, patients are more prone to opportunistic infections. This phenomenon usually occurs within several years once CD4 count is less than 200 cells/mm3.28Nevertheless, the production of new CD4 cells to counter the dead HIV-induced lymphocyte cells requires time. Our study indicated that there were reductions in the CD4 counts of all the treatment groups and the control speci cally groups A (low dose honey) and D (control), showed signi cant reductions in CD4 counts. On the contrary, the reduction in CD4 counts were not signi cant in subjects treated with intermediate and high doses of honey (groups B and C respectively). As discussed earlier, even the CD4 counts of patients on antiretroviral therapies with good VL suppression may not return to normalcy. In fact, there were reports showing reduction of CD4 or failure of CD4 levels to return to normalcy even among patients with good VL suppression following treatment with antiretroviral therapies.29This phenom- enon may be due to persistent HIV infections which shorten the life span of CD4 T-cells,30causing functional dysregulation.31Another plausible explanation for the poor CD4 cell recovery especially in subjects receiving intermediate and high doses of honey is apoptosis32,33secondary to chronic activation of uninfected cells responding to HIV leading to activation-induced cell death.34In addition, reduction in CD4 has been reported to be lower amongna\u00efve CD4 cell productions, 34subsequently leading to reduced production of CD4 cells. Our study on honey cannot be compared with that of an anti- retroviral therapy since the mode of actions are different and honey is given merely as a supplement, not for treatment. With its good antioxidant and anti-in flammatory activities, honey con- sumption is expected to boost the immunity which can help the body combat infections naturally and are not intended for killing of the HIV virus. The insigni cant reduction in CD4 seen in groups which received both intermediate and high doses of honey suggests that the HIV subjects might have bene ted from honey adminis- tration since the decreased in CD4 counts seen was lower than that Table 1 Baseline characteristics of the subjects.

Wan Yusuf et al. / Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine 9 (2019) 249 e256 252of the control and low dose groups, as normally shown in the natural progression of HIV infections among untreated patients. Thending suggests that the improvements in CD4 counts in groups which received intermediate and high doses of honey are useful since improvements in CD4 count is one of the important prognostic outcomes for HIV patients.35Moreover, honey being a natural product is known to confer its effects relatively slower as compared to modern medicine while the production of CD4 cells in countering dead HIV-induced lymphocyte cells requires time. Although honey has also been reported to increase apoptosis incancer cells and is protective against apoptosis for normal cells,36 no studies have been conducted to con rm apoptosis in HIV- infected cells treated with honey so far. In addition, honey was also known to be protective against blood cells damage37indicating its utility in actively-proliferating cells. The VL ndings showed 130% increment from baseline (group THC) and 31% (group THI) while reductions were seen in groups THL and THH (by 26% and 8% respectively). However, within group analyses indicated no signi cant differences between groups THL and THH as compared to Group THC. This result is not surprisingTable 2 Comparison of CD4 absolute count within each treatment group based on time (n \u00bc95).

Trend of VL reduction in the treatment groups with increment seen in both intermediate and control groups.W.N. Wan Yusuf et al. / Journal of Traditional and Complementary Medicine 9 (2019) 249 e256 253since honey is known for its antibacterial22and antifungal prop- erties.38However, to our knowledge there were no previous reports on the inhibitory effects of honey on HIV and our report is the rst to demonstrate this effect. Tualang honey contains phenolic compounds including caffeic acid39andflavonoids such as quercetin which are strong antioxi- dants that are also reported to have anti-HIV 1 activity.39Tualang honey is also reported to contain another potent antioxidant named pinobanksin.39The presence of the various types of anti- oxidants may contribute to the reduction in VL in the treated group and increment of VL in the control group. Methylglyoxal in honey is also reported to confer some anti-HIV activities since it has been reported to interfere with the assembly of new HIV virions and maturation of the virions in the later stages of HIV infection.40High amounts of methylglyoxal has also been reported to be present in Manuka41and Iranian honeys40although its presence was not re- ported in Tualang honey previously. Besides honey, other bee products have also been reported to be useful against HIV infection. An example is propolis, a substancecollected by the honey bees which is reported to confer some anti- HIV-1 activity in CD4 lymphocytes and microglial cell cultures.42 Although the products were not investigated in our study, honeymay also contain propolis, royal jelly, bee venom and pollen during the cultivation process, all of which are important substances that have anti-HIV effects. In addition, mellitin, another importantsubstance present in the bee venom has been reported to suppress HIV-1 gene expression. 43These are some of the plausible mecha- nism of actions for honey's anti-HIV activity. In terms of QOL, signi cant improvements in physical and psychological scores for all subjects who received honey treatment were seen as compared to control at three and six months following treatment. Honey contains some important carbohydrates including fructose and glucose which can supply some energies to the individuals thus improving the subjects' physical wellbeing as conrmed by the enhanced physical scores seen among the groups administered with honey. In addition, honey also contains trypto- phan and phenylalanine44which is a precursor for serotonin45and dopamine46respectively. Neurotransmitters produced in the body can affect mood and social behavior, appetite and digestion, sleep, memory as well as sexual desire and function.47 We investigated HIV subjects with CD4 counts between 250 and 600 cells/ml because these individuals already have a decreased immunity, are more prone to having infections and malnutrition but have not yet received antiretroviral treatment. It is plausible that honey supplementation may help the subjects achieve a better QOL as also shown by Rosediani et al. (2017) and delay disease progression to AIDS.48Honey is also known to have anti- inflammatory activities49which may reduce the risk of inflammation-related diseases in HIV patients including cardio- vascular problems.50HIV, being a chronic disease, may result in chronic diarrhoea and a poorer appetite, both of which may also contribute to malnutrition. In addition, honey is a natural product which contains not only carbohydrates, but also other important nutrients, minerals, vitamins, trace elements and proteins. Overall, the antibacterial, anticancer, antioxidant, antidiarrhoeal and nutritional properties of honey may boost the nutritional status and physical wellbeing of HIV patients all of which may help them better combat opportunistic infections, improve nutritional status and quality of lives. To our knowledge, this is the rst extensive study to investigate on honey treatment in a group of HIV patients. Heidari et al. 201251 reported a 1% increment in CD4 and CD8 cell counts in a singlepatient administered with 80 g of honey daily for 30 days. Al-Waili et al. reported that honey administered at 80 g daily for 21 days to a 40 year old patient with a long history of AIDS showed decreased prostaglandin level, elevated nitric oxide production and improved lymphocytes, platelet count, serum protein, albumin and copper levels. 52 Our study has some limitations. A longer duration of honey administration (up to one year) should be conducted to perceive aTable 4 Comparison of viral load between the groups based on time.

In our study, the subjects were administered with a maximum dose of 20 g of honey thrice daily based on an in- house study conducted previously. In addition, dose of honey may be increased to 80 g daily to achieve a more signi cant nding. Further studies are required to elucidate the molecular mecha- nisms of action of Tualang honey in asymptomatic HIV subjects which may address some of these issues. 5. Conclusion Honey, especially at 40 g and 60 g daily doses, has the potential to improve QOL (both physical and psychological) and CD4 counts in asymptomatic HIV subjects not on HAART. There was a trend of lower VL following Tualang honey administration in asymptomatic HIV subjects thus supporting the possible role of honey in boosting the immune system by improving the CD4 counts and reducing VL in HIV positive subjects.
