The budget is comprised of $272,004,364 in Local funds, $200,000 in Dedicated Taxes, $15,134,620 in Federal Grant funds, $2,991,414 in Federal Medicaid Payments, $446,290 in Private Grant funds, $161,153 in Private Donations, $2,650,320 in Special Purpose Revenue funds, and $14,059,343 in Intra-District funds. Recurring Budget The FY 2021 Budget for DBH includes a reduction of $1,591,708 and 15.0 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) across multiple divisions to account for the removal of one-time funding appropriated in FY 2020. The funding was comprised of $1,020,708 to support indirect cost recovery expenditures, $371,000 to support free-standing mental health clinic services for non-Medicaid eligible patients, and $200,000 to support the study of Mental Health and Substance Abuse in Immigrants Communities Act of 2017. Mayor's Proposed Budget Increase: In the budget submission for the Department of Behavioral Health (DBH), a proposed Local funds increase of $7,558,198 and 40.6 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) will be used across multiple divisions to align salaries and Fringe Benefits with projected costs. The agency will also reallocate 12.7 FTEs from temporary to permanent. An increase of $3,590,624 across multiple divisions supports proposed fixed cost estimates primarily due to Security, Occupancy, Energy and Rent. A proposed Local funds increase of $1,449,632 will be used across multiple divisions in nonpersonal services to provide additional funding to subsidies, professional services, and supplies. In the proposed budget submission for Federal Medicaid Payments, an increase of $147,817 across multiple divisions will support personal services costs and aligns the budget with projected federal reimbursement for qualified Medicaid services. A projected increase of $9,946 within the System Transformation division will be made in Private Grant funds, and a proposed increase of $298,673 and 1.0 FTE across multiple divisions will be made to Special Purpose Revenue funds. These adjustments will properly align the budgets with projected revenues.Department of Behavioral Health FY 2021 Approved Budget and Financial Plan - Congressional Submission E-42 Decrease: The agency has projected a savings of $5,173,575 in Local funds in multiple divisions related to program efficiencies in Contractual Services. A proposed decrease of $20,581,061 and 12.8 FTEs in Federal Grant funds is primarily due to the expiration of four grants, and a decrease of $111,768 and 3.5 FTEs in Intra-District funds is primarily due to an expired Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Human Services. Enhance: DBH will receive Local funds enhancements in the Saint Elizabeths Hospital division. $500,000 in one-time funding will be used to support the improved maintenance of facilities, and an additional $500,000 will serve to support Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI) residential placements. Reduce: Local funds savings have been identified in the agency in multiple divisions. DBH will realize savings of $150,000 in pharmacy costs, $315,000 in community-based behavioral services, $616,602 in revised fixed cost estimates, $655,681 in nonpersonal services to align resources with operational goals, $2,486,927 through the reduction of 19.0 FTEs, and $7,095,000 in of hours of care provided by community support services. DBH will reduce $42,221 and 0.5 FTE in Federal Grant funds, and $36,198 and 0.3 FTE in Intra-District funds in the Community Services division. Enhance/Reduce: DBH's budget includes a net increase of $98,585 and 2.0 FTEs in Local funds across multiple divisions. This is the result of an enhancement of $109,500 and 2.0 FTEs to provide specialized therapy and intensive case management services for consumers acquitted not guilty by reason of insanity who are discharged from Saint Elizabeths Hospital, partially offset by a reduction in personal services of $10,915. District's Approved Budget Enhance: The approved Local funds budget for DBH will reflect enhancements across multiple divisions and activities. The Community Services division will receive additional funding to further expand school-based mental health and adult mental health rehabilitation services. This will be reflected as a net increase of $8,631,656 in subsidies and $644,457 and 5.5 FTEs in personal services costs for clinicians. In addition, the Clinical Services division will receive $300,000 to support mobile mental community outreach response to critical incidents.

The budget is comprised of $857,622,717 in Local funds, $98,195,140 in Dedicated Taxes, $6,067,676 in Federal Grant funds, $2,472,818,580 in Federal Medicaid Payments, $6,596,710 in Special Purpose Revenue funds, and $138,715,711 in Intra-District funds. Recurring Budget The FY 2021 Budget for DHCF includes a reduction of $6,220,802 and 6.0 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) across multiple divisions to account for the removal of one-time funding appropriated in FY 2020.

Mayor's Proposed Budget Increase: The Department of Health Care Finance's (DHCF) proposed Local funds budget submission includes an increase of $15,256,519 within the Health Care Finance division to support the impact of utilization and enrollment increases on payments to Medicaid and Alliance managed care organizations and providers. A proposed net increase of $5,986,412 across multiple divisions in nonpersonal services will primarily be used to support the DC Access System (DCAS).

These funds will support salary, steps, Fringe Benefits, and the reallocation of 3.4 FTEs from temporary to permanent. A proposed increase of $12,120,715 in Dedicated Tax funds across several divisions will align the budget with projected revenues to support personal service costs and agency initiatives. This adjustment is primarily due to increased projections from the Nursing Home Quality of Care and Healthy DC funds to increase subsidies in the Health Care Finance division.

These funds will be used for projected salary, steps, and Fringe Benefit costs of existing personnel as well as subsidies for District residents.

The proposed budget submission includes an increase in this fund of $332,964,223 in nonpersonal services, and $1,309,097 and 2.8 FTEs in projected salary and Fringe Benefit costs. A proposed increase of $2,568,826 and 1.9 FTEs in the budget submission for Special Purpose Revenue funds is attributed primarily to a projected increase in the Medicaid Collections Third Party Liability fund. In Intra-District funds, there is a proposed increase of $31,135,680, along with the reduction of 0.5 FTE across multiple divisions. DHCF has signed Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with District agencies to provide a variety of services, including services to Medicaid-eligible consumers and support for beneficiaries with severe mental illnesses. Decrease: A net Local funds savings of $85,637 has been identified across multiple divisions is the result of fixed costs estimates provided by the Department of General Services and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer for Energy, Telecommunications, Rent, Security Services, and Occupancy. Cost saving measures put in place will allow the agency to realize a Local funds savings of $5,950,376 across multiple divisions in Contractual Services. Enhance: DHCF will receive Local funds enhancements in FY 2021.

The budget is comprised of $419,713,591 in Local funds, $169,294,054 in Federal Grant funds, $16,561,911 in Federal Medicaid Payment funds, $1,000,000 in Special Purpose Revenue funds, and $3,364,439 in Intra-District funds.Department of Human Services FY 2021 Approved Budget and Financial Plan - Congressional Submission E-116 Recurring Budget The FY 2021 budget for DHS includes a reduction of $12,234,317 and 24.0 Full-Time-Equivalent (FTE) positions to account for the removal of one-time funding appropriated in FY 2020. This funding was comprised of $3,801,613 to support costs associated with Indirect Cost Recovery, $2,999,990 to support the Rapid Rehousing program, $2,127,714 to support Homeless Street Outreach programs, $1,320,000 to support the housing to Transitional Age Youth, $1,115,000 to fund the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP), $870,000 to support Federal City Shelter security enhancements. Mayor's Proposed Budget The Department of Human Services' (DHS) overriding mission is to empower every District resident to reach their full potential by providing meaningful connection to work opportunities, economic assistance, and supportive services. DHS' FY 2021 budget proposal reflects the following priorities: developing an effective system of care for families who experience homelessness; developing an effective crisis response system for unaccompanied adults who experience homelessness; supporting TANF participants to improve their economic stability and well-being; improving the customer experience at DHS service centers; and implementing a system of services and supports for youth. Increase: DHS' proposed Local funds budget includes an increase of $8,703,113 across multiple divisions to account for projected Fixed Cost estimates. This adjustment includes $4,673,050 for Occupancy; $1,975,221 for for Rentals; and $63,034 for Telecommunications costs. Additionally, the proposed Local budget reflects an increase of $72,389 primarily in the Agency Management division to support the agency's operational goals for the D.C. Access System (DCAS). In Federal Grant funds, DHS proposes a net increase of $3,226,493, due primarily to Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreements with the Department of Health Care Finance (DHCF) to support DCAS. DHS also proposes an increase of $2,610,590 for Rental costs. In addition, the agency's proposal for personal services is increased by $190,917 to reflect adjustments to salaries and Fringe benefits. This adjustment includes a net reduction of 9.6 FTEs to reflect a transfer to the Department of Aging and Community Living (DACL). DHS' proposed budget for Federal Medicaid Payments supports an increase of $1,989,410 to cover projected Rental costs.

Decrease: DHS' Local funds budget proposal reflects a net decrease of $23,876,085 across multiple programs. The reduction is primarily driven by three factors: cost savings of $11,523,567 in various grants and contracts in the Homeless Services division; a reallocation of $8,703,113 to fund projected increases in various Fixed-Cost commodities; and a reduction of $2,466,994 in Subsidies and Transfers to align the personal services budget. DHS' Federal Grant funds proposal reflects a decrease of $5,556,071 to reflect reduced projected carryover of TANF funding. DHS' Federal Medicaid Payments budget proposal includes a decrease of $276,949 to align the budget with Fixed Cost estimates. Shift/Increase: DHS' Local funds budget proposal is increased by $6,362,259 and 46.4 FTEs across multiple divisions. This adjustment is primarily due to the reallocation of $2,560,646 and 23 positions from the agency's Federal Medicaid Payments to the Local funds budget. The additional funding and FTE increase is attributed to various personal services adjustments to align the budget with projected revenues and to account for career ladder promotions, step increases, and Fringe Benefits. Shift/Decrease: DHS Federal Medicaid Payments budget proposal is decreased by $2,574,005 and 35.1 FTEs primarily due to the reallocation of 23 positions to the agency's Local funds budget and 2 positions to Federal Grant funds. The remaining 10 positions were eliminated because of a change in the DCAS cost allocation plan.FY 2021 Approved Budget and Financial Plan - Congressional Submission Department of Human Services E-117 Enhance: DHS' Local funds budget proposes several new initiatives totaling $16,390,800 in the Family Services division, including $11,070,800 to provide one-time funding for the Family Rehousing and Stabilization Program (FRSP); $4,000,000 in one-time funding to support two initiatives - $2,000,000 for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program (ERAP) and $2,000,0000 to support hotel costs for the homeless - and $1,320,000 in one-time funding to support transitional age youth shelters, related to a reduction in the recurring budget for the same purpose.

The budget is comprised of $131,048,076 in Local funds, $33,233,191 in Federal Grant funds, $14,513,225 in Federal Medicaid Payments, and $14,754,614 in Special Purpose Revenue funds. Recurring Budget The FY 2021 budget for DDS includes a reduction of $1,093,000 and 10.0 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) to account for the removal of one-time funding appropriated in FY 2020 to partially support activities covered by indirect cost recovery funding. Mayor's Proposed Budget Increase: DDS proposes a Local funds increase of $888,556 across multiple divisions to support the cost of pre-existing programmatic initiatives. These funds will support the Development Disabilities Administration Waiver and the increase in cost of residential services provided by the agency. Also in Local funds, a net increase of $259,620 in the Agency Management division is the result of fixed costs estimates provided by the Department of General Services for Rent, Security, and Energy. The proposed Local funds budget for personal services costs includes a net increase of $231,946 and 6.4 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs) across multiple divisions to align the budget with projected salary and fringe benefit expenditures. DDS will also reallocate 2.2 FTEs from part-time to full-time. In Federal Grant funds, a proposed increase of $2,204,039 aligns the budget with projected grant awards that will primarily be used in the Rehabilitation Services division. The proposed budget submission for Federal Medicaid Payments includes an increase of $1,438,571, which aligns the budget with projected reimbursements for Medicaid-eligible services provided by DDS, and a net increase of $574,033 and 6.0 FTEs, which will support salary and Fringe Benefit adjustments. The DDA division is expecting an increase of $3,377,331 in Special Purpose Revenue funds, which will be used in the form of subsidies to support the cost of care for non-Medicaid clients, and $3,666,992 to support the cost of the Maintenance of Persons program across multiple divisions. Decrease: In Federal Grant funds, adjustments in personal services will result in a decrease of $57,983 and 2.4 FTEs across multiple divisions, and a decrease of $792,455 aligns the proposed budget with fixed cost estimates. The proposed budget also includes a decrease of $49,677 in Intra-District funds in the Rehabilitation Services division related to the Memorandum of Understanding with the Office of Disability Rights. Enhance: The Local funds proposed budget includes a one-time increase of $3,061,000 to support the Medicaid Waiver Growth Factor, and an additional $271,000 will be used to support residential services in the Developmental Disabilities Administration division. Reduce: DDS will realize additional savings in Local funds across multiple divisions. A savings of $1,084 will be made to align fixed costs with revised estimates; a savings of $293,084 will align personal services and Fringe Benefits with projected costs; and a savings of $10,527,983 is primarily related to the Intellectual Developmental Disabilities Waiver, Maintenance of Persons, and Vocational Rehabilitation services.

Wilson Building Fund is to provide an efficient, clean, and safe working environment for District employees in a modernized century-old historic building. Easily accessible to the public, the Wilson Building is an emblem of District pride showcased on the elegant Pennsylvania Avenue corridor within the Federal Triangle, just blocks from the White House. Culminating a five-year renovation, expansion, and restoration, the Wilson Building reopened to acclaim in late 2001. Built in 1904 and later named after the long-term District Council member and Chairman, the building had suffered from neglect and had to be closed in 1996. Preservation-minded District officials emerged with a redevelopment plan and, starting in 1996, the Wilson Building underwent a renovation based on plans from architect Shalom Baranes. The result is a modern workplace for District government that retains much of its historic flavor and texture. Housed in the building are the Executive Office of the Mayor, the District Council, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and a number of other District agencies. The Wilson Building will serve the District for many years, while preserving a link to the past. The agency's FY 2021 approved budget is presented in the following tables:John A.

A PILOT payment on debt issued under the District's PILOT Act equals the amount the property owner would otherwise pay in property taxes, based on the assessed value of the property. The repayment of the borrowing against this future PILOT revenue is budgeted in this program. This borrowing is similar in concept to Tax Increment Financing, in which the District borrows against future tax receipts and uses the proceeds to spur economic development. In addition, the District Council can approve other project-based PILOT financing, outside the scope of the PILOT Act.

Depending on the structure of bond documents, such additional revenues may be used to pre-pay principal on TIF financings, reserved for future debt service payments, or returned to the District's General Fund. For FY 2021, the District is expected to be entitled to refunds from the Gallery Place and Mandarin bond trustees totaling $9,118,644. This is the amount by which estimated tax increments from the Gallery Place and Mandarin projects exceed scheduled bond debt service.

The Fund is used to pay benefits for private and public sector employees during periods of unemployment. Payments include transfers to other governments to reimburse unemployment benefits paid to District residents. Trust funds are fiduciary funds that are used to account for assets held by the District in a trustee capacity or as an agent for individuals, private organizations, and other governments. Such trust funds are custodial in nature, reporting only assets and liabilities. Because fiduciary funds cannot be used for the operations of the government, they are not included in the District's government-wide financial statements. Prior to FY 2005, these agency trust funds were included in the operating budgets of the agencies that administered the trust funds. The District created a separate agency fund in FY 2005 so that the District's budget structure would report these trust funds pursuant to the District's accounting structure. The Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund was separated from the DOES budget for improved fiscal transparency and to enable the District's budget format to more closely follow the presentation of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report.

The mission of Events DC is to generate economic and community benefits for the residents and businesses of the District of Columbia by creating the premier event experience in the nation's capital, and through the promotion of Washington, DC, as a world-class tourist destination. Summary of Services In 1994, the Washington Convention Center Authority (WCCA) was created as a corporate body and an independent authority of the District of Columbia government responsible for managing and operating the District's Convention Center and for bringing national and international conventions, trade shows, and meetings to the District of Columbia. [\"Washington Convention Center Authority Act of 1994,\" D.C. Law 10-188, effective September 28, 1994]. Pursuant to the Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Support Second Emergency Act of 2009 and the Fiscal Year 2010 Budget Support Act, the District of Columbia Sports and Entertainment Commission was merged into WCCA to form a new organization known as the Washington Convention and Sports Authority (WCSA). The merger created one umbrella organization with a broadened charter to also promote the District as a key sports, entertainment, and special events destination. Also, as part of the merger, WCSA gained control over the Nationals Park, the Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium (RFK), and the non-military portions of the DC Armory. Facility maintenance for RFK and the Armory, previously performed by the D.C. Sports and Entertainment Commission, was assumed by the Department of Real Estate Services, now the Department of General Services. In June 2011, the Washington Convention and Sports Authority launched a new brand name, \"Events DC.\" The new brand entity fully encompasses the event experience in the city, elevates the organization's coreWashington Convention and Sports Authority FY 2021 Approved Budget and Financial Plan - Congressional Submission H-78 assets and portfolio, and perhaps most importantly, aligns with the existing brands for Washington DC and the city's promotional arm, Destination DC.

Three members, including the Chief Financial Officer of the District, the chief executive of the Hotel Association of Washington DC, and the third person designated by the Mayor, serve as voting ex-officio members.
