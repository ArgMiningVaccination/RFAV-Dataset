Jay grew up in India, and one of the earliest memories he had was his grandfather harvesting fresh herbs from the banks of the nearby river. His grandmother would grind the herbs using a stone grinder and produce hand rolled pills. His grandfather didn't have any formal education in Ayurveda but was a self-taught practitioner. He saw a few clients and was able to heal some rare diseases at the time. With inspiration from his grandfather, Jay went onto study Ayurveda in college, where he had the opportunity to be surrounded by some enthusiastic classmates and inspiring mentors who shared his passion for Ayurveda. He studied with traditional practitioners and specifically sought out to explore the practices of indigenous tribes of India. Jay had a real passion for learning how herbs function in the native form. The nomadic tribes who lived in huts taught him the importance of reforestation and simple practices of harvesting herbs closest to its natural state. The immersion with tribal groups and deep understanding of herbs has allowed him to derive highly customized herbal combinations. When he first hears his clients symptoms, he is spontaneously able to identify the primary and secondary herbs necessary for healing. His intuitive technique allows him to validate his selection later and provide a unique and effective formulation. His advice to the thousands of students he has impacted is to make friends with the herbs, and then the herbs will reveal itself at the right time. Anu also grew up in an Indian village, from childhood, she had a great passion to become a healer. She always visualized healing to be surrounded with spirituality and unconditional love and care. With roots from Kerela, where Ayurveda continues to flourish , it was natural for her to study Ayurvedic medicine as Ayurveda integrates spirituality and science. During her childhood days, she was exposed to many of the Ayurvedic practices and has fond memories of the herbs and wonderful Ayurvedic smells. While studying Ayurveda, Anu realized that she had a passion for spreading the knowledge, but never could fathom how she would spread this wisdom. Now it is clear that Anu had realized her dream and inspired thousands of students over the years. Her s tudents have become established clinicians and have opened successful practices. Anu's first opportunity to practice Ayurveda was at a clinic in Mysore, India. While working there, she met Jay, and eventually got married. With a shared passion for Ayurveda they opened a small clinic in Bangalore, India called Athreya Ayurvedic Care. They were able to serve and heal many clients. At the core of it they wanted to provide exceptional service, and soon international clients would arrive and invite them to conduct lectures, workshops, and consultations internationally. They have been invited to various countries to provide Ayurvedic healing and education. Jay is a world-renowned speaker, professor of Ayurvedic medicine and a NAMA registered practitioner.

They decided to re-establish their small Athreya clinic from India into an organization that would focus on producing Ayurvedic herbs and formulations. Their clientele would be U.S. clients, students, and practitioners. Their focus was to build relationships with eco-friendly suppliers that would deliver high potency herbs. They extensively researched the optimal regional conditions, and they were able to identify and source a variety of high-quality herbs.
