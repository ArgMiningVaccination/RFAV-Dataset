Today it is well accepted that exposure to the chemicals around us, in our food and clothing, our offices and homes, as well as medications and past immunizations often have a sickening effect on the human body. Our bodies accumulate and store chemicals and poisons faster than our systems can break them down and excrete them. The result can be a constant low level of poor functioning in life. Toxic overload doesn't look only like the common ailments we see, but it is also apparent in the way we think. If you believe you should be more confident, or more successful in life and love, if you are tired and bored with getting up every morning to repeat the same dead-end routine, you are probably experiencing the dragging effect of toxins. How Do You Know If You Need to Detoxify? It is not a secret that toxins are the root cause of all diseases. The body is in serious need of a regular detoxification to reduce damage to the immune system, metabolism and for the prevention of diseases. A good cleanse maintains good health and promotes the body's natural healing from illnesses.

Detoxing physically has a clearing and energising effect on the mind and improves the mood, making feel more alive, more motivated and more positive. Detox can be challenging at times so why not simply start with Chinese medicine: Acupuncture, Chinese herbs, Cupping and Nutritional and Lifestyle Counseling Acupuncture for Detox In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Qi is the vitality or life force that is the essence of every living being. In today's stress-filled world, it is easy for Qi to become blocked, undermining your health and making it easier for toxins to build up. A poor diet, laden with heavy and unhealthy foods, contributes to the problem by layering on more toxins faster than the body can get rid of them. Yet when your body is filled with these toxins, it tends to crave more of them, leading to a self-replicating cycle that further blocks Qi, saps your energy, and creates a general sense of unwellness. Acupuncture unblocks Qi, allowing your body's natural vitality to flow uninterrupted. It also has a diuretic effect, allowing you to release toxins through your kidneys and urinary tract. acupuncture encourage the liver to detoxify more. Acupuncture cause you to have deeper and more restful sleep, which facilitates rapid healing. As you shed the toxins and experience freely moving Qi, you will begin to reconnect with your body's internal signals. Healthy foods will keep you feeling energized, while those that are unhealthy will make you feel overloaded and tired. You will naturally begin to crave what your body needs, rather than what stress and a toxin buildup have convinced it to crave. Chinese Herbs for Detox Chinese herbs detoxification typically focuses on the liver, kidneys, bowels, lymphatic system, and other internal systems that assist in the elimination of waste. Therefore, the most commonly used herbal remedies are specifically targeted toward one or more of those systems. The goal is to promote the gentle and natural elimination of toxins from your body. Chinese Herbs works with your body to bring you to a better state of health. Cupping for Detox Cupping is based on the Chinese meridian theory of the body. Glass cups or plastic cups are placed on the body's meridians creating suction. The vacuum formed by cups brings the old, non-circulating stagnant blood and interstitial fluids up to the surface so that healthy free circulation can be restored to the affected area, thus creating space for oxygen, new cells and nutrients for faster recovery. Cupping leaves the marks which indicate that toxins and static blood has been moved from the deeper layers to the surface. The marks can appear from a light pink to a dark purple together with tiny raised bumps, representing the severity of patient's condition. Cupping helps to improve skin's respiration and permits the exchanges of gases of the skin cells. After the few treatments body will work better at producing energy and eliminating waste, the skin color will look better and body will have adequate movement and flow.

Testimonial: Started becoming to Energy Body Acupuncture clinic due to my acnes problem. After few sessions, I already see a huge difference on my face. Didn't know what the cause was until I come to Dr. Yang. I was having digestion problem and hormones imbalanced. He helped solving my internal issues and I felt a lot better. I love coming to this place, very relaxing and comfortable. He is very patient, gentle and easy to talk to. Call and schedule appointments ahead of time! I have consistent Acne problem for years due to imbalanced hormone. Dr Yang has helped on the problem a lot. Right after the first acupuncture by Dr. Yang, my facial skin color changed from dull to radiant. I was very amazed by the changes of my facial skin. Thank you, Dr. Yang! I heard and read about the benefits of acupuncture but unless you grow up exposed to this type of alternative medicine it can be scary and confusing. I decided to try it after my anxiety attacks returned. I heard of the benefits though reading different articles. The doctor Yang was very quick to analyze the problem and find the source of what needed balancing. I loved that he focused on balancing my body rather than fixing just one problem. The actual insertion of pins wasn't too bad. There were a few I felt but mildly. After he left me to relax in a darkened room with music and other relaxing techniques. He explained after I would need a few more sessions. He also recommended some food suggestions. By the next morning I noticed a difference. I started to feel like myself again and balanced. Highly recommended Dr. Yang. I had a number of health problems including allergies, insomnia, and high levels of stress and anxiety from my work situation. I often found myself lying awake at night unable to sleep. It seemed that the less sleep I got, the more other health problems began to arise. However, I did not want to have to take sleeping or other medications to get through this difficult time in my life. Eastern medicine seemed like my last chance. When I first came to see Dr. Yang, he took a very thorough initial evaluation, asking lots of questions about my general health and history. The whole process was so comprehensive\u2014very different from other doctors I have been to before. Dr. Yang quickly determined that certain systems in my body, like digestion, were in a sense \"victims\" of my stress and anxiety. He first worked to get those back in check by administering weekly acupuncture treatments and then herbal medicine. Dr. Yang worked closely with me until I felt like my old self again. He is very knowledgeable and really looks at the body as a whole. He is also an extremely caring and compassionate practitioner. I would highly recommend him "}
