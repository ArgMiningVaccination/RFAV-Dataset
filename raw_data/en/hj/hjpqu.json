What our customers say I've been to see Talia a couple of times for niggling shoulder issues and she has Always been super helpful, knowledge and a pleasure to deal with. Would definetly recommend to anyone for sports, work or general injuries Such a great environment and atmosphere, Talia is very knowledgeable and is full of knowledge to help their clients get back to normal as quickly as possible. Highly recommended Talia is the queen of dry needling! Such a great location and Talia and her team are super welcoming with professionalism and expertise. I would return to her for any of my aches and pains! I've been seeing isla for a number of months and she's helped me with my mid thoracic, scapula and lumbar back pain. Isla used great techniques such as cupping, dry needling and muscle manipulation and educated me on the possible side effects with each technique, and I haven't had pain as bad as before, allowing me to attend to my everyday ADL's. I couldn't recommend isla enough to anybody! Thank-you once again I saw Kylie at Active Balance recently due to pain and mobility issues from extended travelling. My hips felt so much better after my treatment and I will definitely be back again soon for another massage. "}
