They may also try various ways of limiting their exposure to certain allergens. When they do eventually see a doctor, that doctor may never have heard of allergy immunotherapy or may be reluctant to prescribe it. As a result, the vast majority of people with severe allergy never receive allergy immunotherapy, while, for those who do, allergy immunotherapy is typically the treatment of last resort after a decade or more of trying other solutions. ALK's goal is to help as many people with allergy as possible, by connecting with them throughout their disease journey, offering them information about their condition, and guidance on where to access proper medical advice and treatment.
