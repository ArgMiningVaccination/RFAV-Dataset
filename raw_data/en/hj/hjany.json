Pierce Salguero & Lan A. Li This film focuses on a major ceremony held each year at the lunar new year in the [Thin Vin Minh ng Quang](http://www.jivaka.net/templefinder/minh-dang-quang/) temple in Telford, in exurban northwest Philadelphia. It is a ritual calling on the Medicine Buddha to bring health, good luck, longevity, and freedom from suffering to the community and the whole world. The film focuses on the main ritual activity during the ceremony, the chanting of the Medicine Buddha Stra, which is the principal text associated with this deity. It is chanted in the Vietnamese language, in a distinctly Vietnamese style of intonation. Aside from emphasis on the aural experience of the ritual, the film also lingers on visual details of the material culture of the temple, the altars, as well as preparations taking place in the kitchen. Background Virtually all Buddhist traditions worldwide have well-developed repertoires of healing rites, and many of these are practiced in the city. In Mahyna Buddhist contexts, which represents the majority of temples in our study, healing rituals typically involve prayer and offerings to call upon deities to intercede in preserving supplicant's health and overcoming their illnesses. The most prevalent Mahyna healing deity in Philadelphia is Avalokitevara, the savior-bodhisattva associated with compassion. She (or, in Vajrayna centers, \"he\") is known by different names, including Guanyin (Ch.), Quan \u00c2m (Vtn.), Kwan Um (Kr.), and Chenrezig (Tib.). The second most common is the \"Medicine Buddha,\" Bhaiajyaguru, known as Yaoshi , Dc S, Yaksabul, or Menla. In most Mahyna temples that explicitly call upon one or both of these deities for healing or protection from illness, the rituals are incorporated into the standard devotional services that are held on a weekly basis. Some temples additionally organize annual or periodic events that bring together the community for special worship. One of the most common forms of devotional practice in Buddhist communities is the chanting of stras (i.e., Buddhist scriptures) or mantras (i.e., shorter incantations in more condensed formats). While specific stras can be chanted for a variety of different purposes, certain titles appeared again and again in the context of Mahyna healing rituals. These most notably include the Medicine Buddha Stra, the Diamond Stra, and the Heart Stra \u2014 all mainstays of East Asian healing practice worldwide. The most common mantras to appear in our survey were the \"Great Compassion Mantra,\" a popular incantation associated with Avalokitevara, as well as the \"Medicine Buddha Mantra.\" It is notable that the chanting of stras and mantras is not limited to temples serving primarily Asian-American communities, but can also be found in some non-Asian meditation centers as well (for example, see the [Soji Zen Center](http://www.jivaka.net/templefinder/soji-zen-center/) and the local [Soka Gakkai International](http://www.jivaka.net/templefinder/soka-gakkai-international-usa/) chapter). Aside from public rituals, private healing rites may also be commissioned for purposes of purification and protection. Such events can be arranged by individuals or families, and can be aimed at overcoming personal bouts of illness or other health-related misfortunes. In Mahyna temples, private healing rituals often consist of the same sorts of actions as might be done in a public ceremony \u2014 prayer, giving of offerings, and chanting \u2014 though now personalized for the family or individual patron. In some Theravda and Vajrayna temples, which tend not to hold public rituals specifically focused on healing, personal healing rites often involve methods that are not normally conducted in public\u2014such as spirit channeling, exorcism, or other esoteric activities. The officiants of such rites are typically monastics, although in some communities lay ritual specialists are also utilized.
