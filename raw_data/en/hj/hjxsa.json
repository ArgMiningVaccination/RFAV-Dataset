It is a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle science, which focuses on bringing harmony between mind and body. The holistic approach of Yoga is well established and it brings harmony to all walks of life. It acts as both a preventive and therapeutic method for dealing with health problems being faced by people and also for their rehabilitation in many situations. Yoga is one of the oldest sciences that deals with the quality of human survival and existence in the world. The practice of Yoga is believed to have started at the very dawn of civilization. UNESCO has recognized Yoga as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity1. The United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) also recognized Yoga as one that provides a holistic approach to health and well- being. Yoga also brings harmony in all walks of life and, thus, is known for health promotion, disease prevention, and management of many lifestyle disorders2. In this context, the Honourable Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, while addressing the 69th session of UNGA on 27 September 2014, urged the international community to adopt an International Day of Yoga. He said: \"Yoga is an invaluable gift of ancient Indian tradition. It embodies unity of mind and body; thought and action; restraint and fulfillment; harmony between man and nature; and a holistic approach to health and well-being. Yoga is not about exercise but to discover the sense of oneness with ourselves, the world and nature. Changing our lifestyle and creating consciousness, can help us to deal with climate change. Let us work towards adopting an International Yoga Day3\". Yoga involves the physical, mental, and social aspects of a person while providing wisdom, ethics, higher quality relationships, and the actual realization of existing spiritual reality in every individual. In modern times, people practice Yoga to preserve and maintain their physical health, mental health and well-being. Accordingly, Yoga institutions are developing various training programs to prepare Yoga teachers and therapists to serve and help common people. The word 'Yoga' is derived from the to Yogic scriptures, the practice of Yoga leads to the union of individual consciousness with universal consciousness. According to modern scientists, everything in the universe is just a manifestation of the same quantum firmament. One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in 'Yoga' and is called a Yogi. A Yogi attains the state of freedom, referred to as Mukti, Nirvana , Kaivalya or Moksha3. The aim of Yoga is self-realization to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation'. 1.2 DEFINITIONS OF YOGA Yoga has been defined differently in various texts. Patanjali in Patanjala Yoga Sutra has explained Yoga as a method by which the restless mind (Chitta ) can be calmed down by controlling mental modifications (Vrittis ).4 The word Chitta denotes the mind in totality as it is taken as the first and finest 1 Yoga - Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA4 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of Indiaevolutes of the matter (the primordial Nature or the Prakriti ). After much contemplation, the learned Rishis (sages) concluded that, in its original form, Chitta is dominated by Sattva-guna; but because of various inputs from different sources, it gets disturbed and becomes unstable . This unstable mind (Chitta ) gives rise to sorrows in life. Ancient Rishis discovered that Yoga could be used as a tool by which an unstable mind (Chitta ) can be made steady and stable. The Bhagawad Gita defines Yoga as the state characterized by of mind' (Samatvam)and 'skillfulness in action' (Karmasu Kaushalam )5. It also advocates selfless work without expectation of the fruits of one's actions (Nishkama Karma ). Samatvam6 (equanimity) is a state of mind in which a person remains unaffected in various situations, such as success and failure, sorrows and happiness, losses and gains, and receiving and giving in life. This equanimity of mind makes a person free from imbalances and helps in making him/her stable and relaxed. Karmasu Kaushalam (skillfulness or excellence in action), as explained in the Bhagawad Gita, means the performance of an action or duty with dexterity. A person should do his/her best using the available right means without any expectation or attachment or the results. Yoga can, therefore, be termed as excellence/skillfulness in action7. The ultimate aim or goal of Yoga remains the same, i.e., attaining a balanced and integrated state of being/consciousness (Samadhi Bhavana) leading to total freedom and emancipation (Moksha ). Regular practice of working with the self (Spiritual Yoga), an individual gets the light of the self, which leads towards self-realization and starts giving rise to a 'feeling of liberation' (Moksha ). Besides that, Yoga also helps to achieve the short-term and ever-changing goals of life depending on the demand or need in one's life. Betterment in health condition, clarity in thoughts, etc. are examples of such short-term goals that keep changing according to the phases of life. Therefore, different practical approaches are prescribed by different Yogic traditions to satisfy and fulfill the short-term goals, needs, and requirements of the stakeholders. Traditionally, three types of Yoga are understood. 1. 'Material Yoga' (Bhautika Yoga)8: Yoga with various objects, events, and phenomena in the external world with the help of five sense organs ( Pancha Jnanendriyas ) Yoga)9: Yoga with the 'self' by working with self-awareness. It may be in a well-balanced and integrated state (Samahita Chitta) or a disturbed state (Vyutthita Chitta ). Usually, it is this type of Yoga, which is studied, understood, and presented as 'Yoga'. 3. 'Transcendental Yoga' ( Parmarthika Yoga): From time to time, certain types of inputs give rise to a state of universal consciousness where we forget ourselves and the objective material world around us. 5 Samatvam Yogauchyate [B.G] -II.47) 8 Various existing educational programs help individuals to make their career and live in the external world (outside the body). Here, the individual gets connected and remains connected with natural and manmade objects, events, and phnomena outside the body through sense and motor organs. 9 From time to time, the individual becomes 'aware of one's disturbed state of being' (atma-sthiti or Chitta-Avastha ) due to various 'inputs' arising from inside the body such as hunger, thirst, distended bladder/colon, pains/aches, inflammations, infections, and mental agitations. In response to these 'inputs', the individual goes into actions/behaviors to get rid of these inputs to feel good and tries to develop a lifestyle or a sort of personal routine. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA5 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India1.3 HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA The practice of Yoga is believed to have started from the very dawn of civilization. As per ancient Vedic texts, Lord Shiva is considered to be the first teacher of Yoga. Yoga, as mentioned earlier, is also widely considered to be an 'immortal cultural outcome' of the Indus Valley Civilization that dates back to 2700 B.C. Yoga encompasses both material and spiritual upliftment, while remaining grounded in basic human values. The presence of Yoga in ancient India is evidenced by numerous seals and fossil remains from the Indus Valley Civilization, depicting Yogic motifs and figures engaged in Yoga Sadhana. These artifacts also suggest the influence of Tantra Yoga through phallic symbols and seals of Mother Goddess idols. Depiction of Yoga is also recorded in folk traditions, Vedic and Upanishadic heritage, Buddhist and Jain traditions, Darshanas Vaishnavas , and Tantric traditions. There are also depictions of primordial or pure Yoga manifested in the mystical traditions of South Asia. This was the time when Yoga was being practiced under the direct guidance of a Guru and its spiritual value was given special importance. It was a part of Upasana and Yoga Sadhana was inbuilt into their rituals. The Sun was given the highest importance during the Vedic period. The practice of 'Surya Namaskara' may have been invented later due to this influence. Pranayama was a part of the daily ritual and offered the oblation. Though Yoga was being practiced in the Pre-Vedic period (2700 B.C.), the Great Sage Maharshi Patanjali systematized and codified the then-existing practices of Yoga, its meaning, and its related knowledge through his Yoga Sutras. After Patanjali, many sages and Yoga masters contributed greatly to the preservation and development of the field through their well- documented practices and literature. This documentary evidence spans from the pre-Vedic era to the period of Patanjali, solidifying the existence of Yoga throughout this timeline. The main sources of information about Yoga practices and the related literature during this period are the 4 Vedas, the 108 Upanishads, the 2 epics (Mahabharata and Ramayana),the 18 Puranas , the and teachings of Buddhism, Jainism , and Panini, etc. Tentatively, the period between 500 B.C. and 800 A.D. (1300 years) is considered the classical period because this was the most fertile and prominent period in the history and development of Yoga. During this period, commentaries of Vyasa on Yoga Sutras , Bhagawad Gita , etc. came into existence. This period can be mainly dedicated to two great religious teachers of India -Mahavir and Buddha. The concepts of Pancha Mahavrata (five great vows) by Mahavir and Ashta Marga (eight- fold path) by Buddha can well be considered as the early nature of Yoga Sadhana. A more explicit explanation of these concepts can be found in the Bhagawad Gita , which presents the concepts of Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Karma Yoga. These three types of Yoga are still the highest example of human wisdom and even today people find peace by following the methods as shown in the Gita . The period between 800 A.D. and 1700 A.D. (900 years) has been recognized as the post-classical period. This period marked the teachings of great Acharyatrayas such as Adi Shankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Suradasa, Tulasidasa, Purandardasa, and Mirabai during this period. The Natha Yogis of the the great personalities who popularised Hatha Yoga practices during this period. Figure 1. Seal of Indus Valley Civilization of Mohenjo-Daro depicting a Yoga postureCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA6 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India The period between 1700 A.D. and 1900 A.D. (200 years) is considered the Modern period. In the modern period, great Yogacharyas such to the development of Raja Yoga. This was the period when Vedanta , Bhakti Yoga, Natha Yoga or, Hatha Yoga also The Shadanga Yoga of Gorakshashatakam, Chaturanga Yoga of Hatha Yoga Pradipika, and Saptanga Yoga of Gheranda Samhita were the main tenets of Hatha Yoga. Now in contemporary times, people have a strong conviction about Yoga practices help in the preservation, maintenance, and promotion of health. Yoga has spread all over the world through the teachings of great personalities like Swami Shivananda, Shri T. traditions, lineages, and Guru-Shishya paramparas of Yoga have led to the emergence of different traditional schools of Yoga -Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Dhyana Yoga, Patanjala Yoga, Laya Yoga, Raja Yoga, Jain Yoga, Bauddha Yoga, etc. Each school has its principles and practices leading to the ultimate aims and objectives of Yoga. However, the widely practiced Yoga Sadhanas (Practices) Yoga Sadhana of all hues and colors is considered a panacea for a meaningful life and living. Its orientation to comprehensive health, both individual and social, makes it a worthy practice for people of all religions, races, and nationalities. Millions of people across the globe have benefitted from the practice of Yoga. 1.4 SALIENT FEATURES OF YOGA The science and philosophy of Yoga are related to the organization and working of the human consciousness. In this respect, it gets closely linked with modern psychology. Working of various Yoga practices can be understood as follows: 'Basic Input-Output System' of computer language, and 'Sensory-Motor' and 'Net-working' activity in the nervous system of modern medical sciences. Yoga presents the concept of 'Energy' (Shakti) and the three modes of working of this energy10 towards (human) 'consciousness' . Yoga can be understood as a process and a goal to be achieved in life. Yoga can be considered as a lifestyle where various aspects of human life such as food and other 'inputs' including (Ahar a), rest relaxation ( Nidra), dealing with one's fears and complexes (Bhaya ), nature of indulgences (Maithuna ), recreation (Vihara), behavior (Achara), thoughts (Vichara), and actions (Vyavahara ) have been deliberated upon. It is a procedure-based system, which helps in de-conditioning and re-conditioning of the psycho- neuro-muscular-glandular systems and helps the outgoing or distracted mind to look inwards. Traditional Yoga texts proclaim that Yoga is suitable for and can be learned and practiced by the youth, old, very old, ill, and weak people. Adult Yoga practitioners can understand the subtle messages of traditional Yoga on their own during various life experiences; while children will require guided teaching under the supervision of a proper teacher (Hatha Yoga Pradipika or nerve impulses responsible for involuntary and autonomic functions and reactions (Kriya Shakti ),(b) Ener - gy or nerve impulses responsible for thinking and decision-making manifested as voluntary actions ( Iccha Shakti ), and (c) Energy or nerve impulses responsible for receiving and getting knowledge, which can give rise to awareness, unde standing, wisdom, and states of consciousness (Jnana Shakti ). CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA7 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Yoga is a journey of the lower 'Self', which is interested in material or worldly life, to the higher 'Self', which is interested in the realization of transcendental reality. Yoga practices help an individual to understand the working of various faculties and abilities and the importance of regulating one's feelings, thinking, willingness, decision-making, action, and knowledge to attain the higher self. It enhances positive interpersonal health and integrates individuality to reach and understand universality. It establishes harmony between body and mind; and human beings and nature. It regulates vital energy and enhances the flow of energy in our system. 1.5 TRADITIONAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA The different philosophies, traditions, lineages, and Guru-Shishya Paramparas of Yoga have led to the emergence of different traditional schools. These schools include Jnana Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga, Patanjala Yoga, Hatha Yoga, Bauddha Yoga, Jain Yoga, Kundalini Yoga, Mantra Yoga, etc. Each school has its own philosophy, approach, and practices that lead to the ultimate aim and objectives of Yoga. JNANA YOGA Jnana Yoga is the pathway of intellect to realize the Brahman (which is featureless) through knowledge (Jnana ). According to Jnana Yoga, Avidya (ignorance) is the root cause of sufferings. The underlying philosophy is that due to Avidya, a person identifies himself/herself with various forms such as body, mind, brain, race, nationality, and so on and remains in pursuit of worldly possessions. However, these things cannot give permanent happiness. For the attainment of permanent happiness and bliss, one has to attain real knowledge about the 'Self' (Atman ) and super-consciousness (Paramataman ). It is this knowledge that can help dispel the darkness of ignorance and enlighten our inner consciousness. The main attributes of this school are featureless Brahman; Jnana as the means of realization and liberation (Moksha ) through realization. BHAKTI YOGA Bhakti Yoga is the path of devotion to enlightenment. Bhakti means unconditional and selfless love and devotion towards God. Bhakti Yoga is a systematic method of engaging the mind in the practice of unconditional and selfless divine love. In this path, a person surrenders himself/herself to the personal deity. Bhakti Yoga is characterized by several attributes such as Anugraha (divine grace), dualism (the distinction between 'self' and God), and complete surrender t o God (Ishwarpranidhana). Bhagavata Purana (7.5./23-24) mentions 'nine primary It consists of (1) Shravana (listening to scriptural stories of personal deity);(2) Kirtana (singing devotional songs); (3) Smarana (remembering the Divine by constantly meditating upon its name and form); (4) Pada-sevana (rendering service incorporating selfless Karma with devotion); (5) Archana (worshiping an image); (6) Vandana (paying homage or 'prostration' before the image of one's chosen deity); (7) Dasya (servitude or the 'unquestioning' devotion to the deity with the attitude of serving the will of God instead of one's ego); (8) Sakhya (friendship and relationship established between the Divine and the devotee); and (9) Figure 2. Jnana Yoga Figure 3. Bhakti YogaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA8 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaAtma-nivedana (complete surrender of the self to the deity). These nine practices can be practiced independently or together. Each of these practices creates specific Bhava (feeling) that appeals to different inner constitutions of practitioners. KARMA YOGA Karma Yoga is the path of action. It is based on the principle of Nishkama Karma (action devoid of any selflessness), the right attitude, and performing one's duties. It emphasizes performing one's duties without having any expectations. The underlying assumption is that Nishkama Karma ultimately leads to joy and happiness. In Karma Yoga, the frame of mind with which the person acts action is important. It emphasizes performing Karma with a sense of duty without having any expectations in return. It also propounds that one should act action (Karma ) skillfully in the best possible way (Karma su Kaushalam ). Karma Yoga, thus, emphasizes the following attributes: performing Karma as a duty skillfulness in action, i.e., with best efforts and efficiency (Karmasu Kaushalam ) and selfless actions (Nishkama Karma). In the context of Karma Yoga, the Bhagawad Gita is the most important text. PATANJALA YOGA Patanjala Yoga, popularly called 'Raja Yoga' is the path of controlling the mental activities/modifications Chitta Vritti Nirodha to attain Kaivalya. Patanjala Yoga, as name suggests, has been propagated by Maharishi Patanjali . It is a systematic process of culturing the mind. Patanjala Yoga or Raja Yoga considers that life is full of suffering caused by mental modifications. According to Patanjali , control of mental modifications is essential to remove suffering and attain permanent bliss. Patanjala Yoga emphasizes Kriya Yoga and Ashtanga Yoga while adopting the correct psychological attitudes of Maitri, Karuna, Mudita, and Upeksha . Liberation (Kaivalya), according to Patanjala Yoga, can be attained with the help of Ashtanga Yoga consisting of moral, psycho-physical, and spiritual training. Samadhi is the last step, which leads to the aim, i.e., control of the mind. Here, Yama and Niyama involve and Samadhi constitute spiritual training. All these eight limbs together are essential for the successful cessation of mental modifications, which, in turn, leads to liberation. HATHA YOGA The term 'Hatha' in Hatha Yoga is a combination of two syllables 'Ha' and 'Tha'. 'Ha' represents mind or mental energy; while 'Tha' represents vital energy (Prana). Thus, Hatha Yoga means union (Yoga) of the mental and pranic energy. According to Gheranda Samhita , Hatha Yoga creates a harmonious Figure 4. Karma Yoga Figure 5. Patanjala YogaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA9 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of Indiabalance among the physical body, the vital energy (Prana), and the mind. It begins with the body; creates a harmonious balance between the Prana and mind; leads to Samadhi (self-realization); and finally leads to Moksha (the blissful, unbroken peace and changeless, undifferentiated consciousness). Hatha Yoga recognizes that the mind can be controlled by controlling the Prana . For this, various practices and techniques Asana, Pranayama, Mudra, Bandha, texts. In context, 'Hatha 'Shiva Samhita ', and Ratnavali' be cited as authoritative texts on Hatha Yoga. JAIN YOGA Jain Yoga believes in separate identities of matter (body) and soul (consciousness). Jainism strongly upholds the individualistic nature of the soul and personal responsibility for one's decisions, and that self- reliance and individual efforts alone are responsible for one's liberation. Jain philosophy attempts to explain the rationale of being and its existence, the nature of the universe and its constituents, and the nature of bondage and the means to a chieve liberation. It does not believe in the existence of a supreme divine as creator, owner, preserver, or destroyer of the universe. Jain Yoga propounded the famous five Mahavrata (great vows), the practice of which will help people to achieve enlightenment. In Jain's philosophy, non-violence (Ahimsa) is a fundamental principle. Non-violence (Ahimsa) means non-injury or absence of desire to harm any life forms. Violence (Himsa) in any form towards self or others inhibits the soul's ability to attain Moksha (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths). The Jain Yoga extends the concept of Ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms, and all beings having life or life potential. Right faith (Samyaka Darshana), right Kayotsarga (a form of meditation), and Preksha meditation constitute the path to attain liberation in Jain Yoga. BAUDDHA YOGA Bauddha Yoga is founded on the teachings of Buddha. It taught the famous 'Four Noble Truths' and 'Eight-fold Path', which allows people to achieve enlightenment. The Four Noble Truths are (1) the truth of suffering, (2) the truth of the cause of suffering, (3) the truth of the end of suffering, and (4) the truth of the path that leads to the end of suffering. The Eight-fold Path of Bauddha Yoga also called the Middle Path is a system of following the eight divisions of the path to cease suffering and achieve spiritual enlightenment. It consists of the following eight practices: (1) right view, (2) right resolve, (3) right speech, (4) right conduct, (5) right livelihood, (6) right effort, (7) right mindfulness, and (8) right Samadhi (meditative absorption or union).The Eight-fold Path teaches that by restraining oneself, cultivating discipline, and practicing meditation, a person can stop the craving for worldly desires and karmic accumulations, thereby ending the suffering and cycle of birth and death. Bauddha Yoga offers a variety of meditation techniques that lead to the path of enlightenment and Nirvana (liberation). These techniques help to develop mindfulness, concentration, tranquility, and supra-mundane powers. Figure 6. Jain Yoga Figure 7. Bauddha YogaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA10 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaLAYA YO GA Laya Yoga is that form of Yoga in which Yoga, that is, Samadhi, is attained through Laya . \"Laya \" means dissolution. Laya is deep concentration causing the absorption of the cosmic principles, stage by stage, into the spiritual aspect of the Supreme Power Consciousness. Laya gives one perfect control over the five Tattvas , mind and Indriya or senses. The fluctuations of the mind will stop. The mind, body and Prana will be entirely subdued.\" In the Yoga Taravali, Sankaracharya states, \"Sadashiva has spoken of 20,000 kinds of Laya , but most important is Nada Anusandhana for it leads to Samadhi.\" The ways of concentrating the mind vary to suit different temperaments and personalities. According to Natha yogis, one way is suitable for all, i.e. Laya in Nada. Vishnu says: 'Layayoga is that in which Chitta (sense-consciousness) undergoes Laya , that is, becomes absorbed in deep concentration; there are many methods most effective is for achieving this: but the Dhyana (deep concentration) on God in form, which can also be done while walking, standing, eating, and resting. This is Laya Yoga. Laya aims on the absorption of the two Polarities: mind and Prana , mediator and the object of meditation, the unmanifest Shakti and manifest Shakti. Theory of how the energy evolves from Muladhara to Sahasrara, plus the awakening of Kundalini, is similarly dealt with in Laya Yoga. It could be termed the Upanishadic Kriya Yoga. The experience of Laya Yoga is so profound that it is like death and rebirth: there is total dissolution of the united, nature and Rebirth to a new dimension. KUNDALINI YOGA Kundalini Yoga is a philosophy that propounds that everyone has spiritual energy and consciousness (Kundalini Shakti , also known as 'serpent power'), which lies dormant in the Muladhara Chakra. There is a need to awaken this energy. When awakened, this energy goes upwards, passes through Sushumna Nadi, activates Chakras, and increases a person's potential and consciousness many folds. Kundalini Yoga is closely related to, or dependent on Hatha Yoga. Kundalini Yoga is founded on yogic physiological terminologies such as Nadis (energy channels), Chakras (energy centers, and Kundalini Shakti). According to the Yogic philosophy, there are three main Nadis, namely, Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna . There are seven Chakras located along the spine starting at its root. The names of these Chakras starting from the lowest in the sequence of upward location are Muladhara Chakra, Swadhishthana Chakra, Manipura Chakra, Anahata Chakra, Vishuddhi Chakra, Ajna Chakra, and Sahasrara Chakra. Chakras are important as the energy flows through the Chakras into the human body. Kundalini Yoga aims to awaken the Kundalini Shakti (which lies dormant in Muladhara Chakra); make it move upwards; and pierce the remaining Chakras one by one. Finally, this Shakti reaches the Sahasrara Chakra, which represents enlightenment, the ultimate goal of spiritual life. The whole process of awakening the Kundalini Shakti requires an aspirant to perform , (Pranayama ), Yoga. Figure 9. Kundalini YogaFigure 8.

Mantra YogaMANTRA YOGA Mantra Yoga is a type of Yoga that uses Mantras to awaken the Self and deepen the meditative aspects of Yoga practice. Mantra Yoga may also be referred to as Japa Yoga. Japa, a Sanskrit word, means the act of repeating Mantras . A Mantra is a sound, a syllable, a phoneme, a word, or a phrase. Its repetition aids in the concentration of the mind during meditation as it engages the mind with sound, its duration, and the number of repetitions. Mantra Yoga is an exact science that uses mantras to get closer to the divinity within. Chanting the mantras creates positive vibrations benefitting both the one who chants and the one who listens. Mantra Yoga helps to neutralize agitation (Rajas ) and inertia (Tamas ) allowing the practitioner to move into a pure state of consciousness. It helps to calm the mind, bring focus, and control the breath. It improves mental health too. Mantras can be practiced in three ways: Vaikhari (chanting loudly), Upanshu (chanting in low voice), and Manas Japa (chanting silently to one's self). From the above, it is clear that all schools of Yoga have their ideologies where each path adopts a different approach but all paths ultimately lead to the same destination. The destination of all schools is the same, i.e., attaining Moksha, bliss or union of individual consciousness with the Super-consciousness. In daily life, Yogic practices from all schools of thought are generally combined and used. 1.6 SELECTED TRADITIONAL TEXTS ON YOGA A.

In Bhagawad Gita , three types of Yoga, namely Karma Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, and Jnana Yoga have been deliberated upon. The Bhagawad Gita has 700 verses divided into 18 chapters. A summary of these chapters is given as follows: 1. Arjuna requests Krishna to move his chariot between the two armies of Kauravas and Pandavas. When Arjuna sees his intimate relatives, teachers, and friends in the opposing army of Kauravas , he loses courage and decides not to fight. 2. Arjuna asks for Krishna's help and submits himself to Krishna . Krishna explains the fundamental distinction between the temporary material body and the eternal spiritual soul. He says that the body may be killed but the eternal self is immortal. He appeals to Arjuna that as a warrior he must uphold the path of Dharma through warfare. 3. Arjuna asks why he should fight if Jnana is more important than action. Krishna stresses that performing his duties for the greater good, but without attachment to results, is the appropriate course of action. 4. Krishna reveals that he has lived many births, always teaching Yoga for the protection of the pious and destruction of the sinful. Krishna talks about the remote history of the Gita, the purpose and significance of his periodic descents to the material world, and stresses the importance of approaching a Guru. 5. Arjuna asks Krishna as which is better: to forgo action or to act? Krishna answers that both ways may be beneficial. He explains that performing all actions but renouncing their fruits is the key to peace, detachment, forbearance, spiritual vision, and bliss. 6. Krishna describes Ashtanga Yoga, the correct posture for meditation, and the process of achieving Samadhi. 7. Krishna teaches the path of knowledge (Jnana Yoga ). He talks about the Supreme Truth, the Supreme Cause, and the sustaining force of everything, both material and spiritual. 8. Krishna defines Brahman, Adhyatma, Karma, Atman, Adhibhuta, and Adhidaiva and explains how one can remember him at the time of death and attain His supreme abode. 9. Krishna explains 'all beings are in me' as a way of remembering him in all circumstances. He explains that by reviving one's pure devotion, one returns to Krishna in the spiritual realm. 10. Krishna describes how he is the ultimate source of all material and spiritual worlds. Arjuna accepts Krishna the Supreme Being, as the supreme cause of all causes, and the support and essence of everything. 11. On Arjuna's request, Krishna displays his 'universal form' (Vishvarupa ), an image of a 'being' facing every way and emitting the radiance of a thousand suns, containing all the beings and material in existence. In the final verse, Krishna again articulates the path of Karma Yoga to Arjuna .CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA16 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India12. Krishna describes the process of devotional service (Bhakti Yoga ). He explains that pure love for Krishna is the highest end of spiritual existence. Those who follow this supreme path develop divine qualities. 13. Krishna describes nature (Prakriti ), the enjoyer (Purusha ), and consciousness. He says that one who understands the difference between the body, the soul, and the super-soul attains liberation from this material world. 14. Krishna explains the three modes (Gunas ) of material nature: Sattva, Rajas , and Tamas . He explains what these modes are, how they act upon us, and how one transcends them. Krishna also mentions the symptoms of one who has attained the transcendental state. 15. Krishna describes a symbolic tree (representing material existence or world), its roots in the heavens, and its foliage on earth. Krishna explains that this tree should be felled with the 'axe of detachment'; this will lead one to His Supreme abode. 16. Krishna tells about the human traits of the divine and the demonic natures. He explains that those who possess divine qualities and lead regulated lives, abiding by scriptural authority, gradually attain spiritual perfection. He counsels that to attain the supreme destination, one should give up lust, anger, and greed; discern between right and wrong action with the help of evidence mentioned in scripture; and thus, act rightly. 17. Krishna tells about faith, thoughts, deeds, and eating habits, all corresponding to the three Gunas : Sattva, Rajas , and Tamas. 18. In conclusion, Krishna asks Arjuna to abandon all forms of Dharma and simply adopt absolute, unconditional loving surrender unto Lord Krishna. He describes this as the ultimate perfection of life. J. Upanishads 'Upanishad', a Sanskrit term, is derived from Upa (near), Ni (down), and Shad (to sit). Thus, the literal meaning of Upanishad is 'sitting down close to the teacher and listening to the teachings'. It implies that groups of pupils sat near the teacher to attain knowledge about the Self (Atmavidya) and knowledge of the universal spirit (Brahmavidya) to destroy their illusions and ignorance. The Upanishads speak of a universal spirit ( Brahman) and an individual soul (Atman). The Upanishads also contain the first and most definitive explanations of the divine syllable 'Aum ' or 'OM', the cosmic vibration that underlies all existence. Upanishads have given birth to three main schools of Vedanta : Advaita School: Advaita means 'not two'.It is based on the principle that Self and Brahman are ONE. Adi Shankara was the first person to consolidate the principles of Advaita Vedanta , though the first historical proponent was Gaudapada. School: Dvaita means 'two'. It was founded by Madhavacharya, who believed that the Self and the Brahman are two separate and different identities. Dvaita School holds that Brahman is a personal God, to be aligned with Vishnu or Krishna . Vishishtadvaita School: It was founded by Ramanujacharya. It has some aspects common with the Advaita and some aspects common with the Dvaita philosophies. Ramanujacharya believed in the existence of plurality and distinction between the soul (Atman ) and the ultimate reality (Brahman ); however, he also affirmed that there the unity of all souls and that the individual soul has the potential to realize identity with the Brahman . There are several Upanishads. According to the Muktika Upanishad, there are 108 Upanishads. Out of 108; it considers 10 Upanishads as Mukhya (principal) Upanishads.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA17 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry Yoga Upanishads, which form part of the collection of minor Upanishads in Hinduism, focus on the teachings and practices of Yoga. Among the 108 Upanishads listed in the Muktiko anthology, there are a total of twenty Yoga Upanishads. It is worth noting that these Yoga Upanishads, along with other minor Upanishads, are typically distinguished from the more ancient thirteen major Principal Upanishads that are associated with the Vedic tradition. Muktiko Upanishad gives a list of 108 Upanishads. Of them, 20 Upanishads deals with Yoga as the major subject. These twenty Upanishads are called Yoga Upanishads.

BRAHMASUTRA The Brahmasutra, also known as Vedanta Sutra, constitutes the logical (Nyaya) starting point of the Vedanta philosophy (Nyaya Prasthana). The Brahmasutras are also known by Sutra, Shariraka Sutras, and Shariraka Sutra. The Brahmasutras are ascribed to Badarayana. The word Sutra means thread. The Brahmasutras stitch together various teachings of Vedanta into a logical and self-consistent whole. While the Upanishads and the Bhagawad Gita are the basic source texts of Vedanta, the Brahmasutra presents the teachings of Vedanta in a systematic and logical order. These Sutras also discuss the role of Karma and God, and critically address the various principles associated with Buddhism, Jainism, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, Shaiva, Shakta, Atheism, aphorisms (Sutras ) in four chapters (Adhyaya ), each chapter further divided into four quarters (Pada). Chapter I, namely Samanvaya (harmony), talks about the ultimate reality (Brahman), which is the goal of life. It has 134 Sutras with 31, 32, 43, and 28 Sutras in the first, second, third, and fourth Pada, respectively. Chapter II, namely Avirodha (non-conflict), discusses and disproves the possible objections to the Vedanta philosophy by asserting that the central themes of Vedanta are always consistent across various texts of Vedanta . This chapter consists of 157 Sutras with 37, 45, 53, and 22 Sutras in the first, second, third, and fourth Pada, respectively. Chapter III, namely Sadhana (the means), describes the process by which ultimate liberation can be achieved. It has 186 Sutras with 27, 41, 66, and 52 in four consecutive Padas . Chapter IV, namely Phala (the fruit), describes the state that is achieved in final liberation. It has 78 Sutras distributed in four Padas having 19, 21, 16, and 22 Sutras , respectively. 1.7 CULTURAL INFLUENCE It is essential to emphasize and highlight that traditional Yoga education-cum-self management is secular and non-territorial in nature and can be practiced globally irrespective of one's sex, culture, education, profession, religion, etc. However, proper knowledge of the social, cultural, religious, and spiritual background of the practitioner/consumer facilitates conflict-free and smooth transfer of knowledge and understanding from the therapist to the consumer during the initial phase of education of the patient. Through Yoga education-cum-self management (Sadhana), one becomes aware of the influence of one's genetic, family, socio economic, professional, political, geographical, historical, educational, financial, social, and religious backgrounds in the development of one's personality. It is, therefore, advisable to present traditional Yoga knowledge and understanding in the framework of the medical knowledge based on the local culture and experience of each country because the medical concepts and understandings can vary significantly from country to country11. Every religion/society has traditional practices similar to Yoga practices. However, they are used for different purposes with different aims and objectives. Therefore, the right understanding of Yoga practices used for therapeutic purposes needs to be developed among Yoga therapists and consumers. 11 For instance, the volume of air entering and leaving the body during breathing is termed 'breath' or 'tidal volume' in con- ventional medicine. It can be collected in a suitable container and the container can be sent to any laboratory for analysis. This breath can be collected even if the person is unconscious or a coma.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA19 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India The consumers and the Yoga teacher or the therapist should have proper communication. The consumers should communicate their expectations and the nature of their inner perceptions to the teacher/therapist/guide at a suitable time in one's learning phase during the practice of Yoga. In the same way, the teacher should also try to understand the background of the consumers (students/ patients/Sadhakas) to impart proper instructions and guide them on the proper path. Otherwise, the desired objectives and outcome of Yoga learning, practice, education, therapy, and Sadhana will not be experienced by the consumer (Sadhaka) and witnessed by the teacher. Usually, well-experienced and well-informed Yoga teachers/therapists give instructions in universally acceptable and secular language, which can be easily followed and understood by the patients. This is important for Yoga Therapy to become acceptable and effective. Yoga teachers aspiring to become therapists and guides need to keep this in mind. It is important for Yoga teachers/therapists/guides to respect the belief system of the patient while imparting instructions and guidance. The consumer/stakeholder (Sadhaka) is helped to understand the universal nature of Yoga, which transcends the boundaries of caste, creed, sex, age, nationality, and religious belief systems. 1.8 HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA Yoga is the science of life; it offers us simple, easy remedies and techniques, and methods to attain physical and mental fitness with minimum expenses and effort in terms of time. Traditional Yoga education is a holistic drugless system. Physical Yoga (Bhautika Yoga ) can be used for maintaining health and fitness having preventive, promotive, and rehabilitative potential. It should be practiced under proper guidance and supervision. Yoga leads a person from the outside to the inside resulting in enhanced self-awareness at physiological and psychological levels. The mind of the person becomes internalized by focusing on awareness, which may otherwise be diffused in different dimensions. Yoga develops the ability to monitor the psycho-physio-neurological state by switching on and off the inputs of channels. Yoga works within and helps to achieve harmony between body and mind resulting in constant happiness. Yoga is a method of training of mind and develops its power of subtle perception that man may discover for himself. Through an integrated and holistic approach, Yoga helps to achieve harmony among the body (Kaya ), the mind (Antah-karana ), and the self (Purusha/Atma ) resulting in a state of constant happiness for the practitioner (Sadhaka). Yoga is a system of physical and mental self-improvement that leads to final liberation. It helps in the proper development of physical, physiological, emotional, cognitive, social, and spiritual aspects of one's personality. At the physical level, Yoga helps in developing physical fitness and physiological homeostasis. At the emotional level, Yoga helps in bringing about emotional balance. At the cognitive level, it helps in developing a balanced perspective. At the social level, it helps to develop positive connectivity with society as a whole. It helps in harmonizing interpersonal relationships. At the spiritual level, it helps in establishing contact with the self and puts the person (Sadhaka) on the path to self-realization leading to freedom and emancipation.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA20 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India1.9 MISCONCEPTIONS AND FACTS ABOUT YOGA There are several misconceptions about Yoga.

Important information sources in the form of manuscripts, and printed books along with commentaries on the original texts by scholars, researchers, and experienced Yoga practitioners highlighting the objectives, logic, and modus operandi of different Yoga techniques are available in Sanskrit, English, and most of the regional languages of India. Different types of Yoga such as Vedic, Samkhya, Tantra, Mantra, Hatha, Bhakti, Karma, and Kriya are discussed in these texts. A Similar kind of literature is available on Buddhism in Pali, on Jainism in Ardhamagadhi, and on Sikhism in Gurumukhi languages. This literature will have to be re-classified according to the claims made for health and therapy by these schools and the nature of Yoga practices described and discussed in them, namely, Vedas, Upanishads, Darshans, Samhitas, Aranyakas, Puranas, etc. In recent times, the age-old Yoga system has undergone a lot of changes to suit the interests, tastes, demands, and needs of different beginners in Yoga having different lifestyles and interests in life as a whole. Accordingly, the literature and presentations in different languages in suitable formats are being brought into circulation by different agencies. Therefore, a consumer needs to know about various Yoga Ashrams , Yoga institutions, Yoga centers, and universities from where they can get reliable information. The sources from where a consumer (Sadhaka) can get authentic information are outlined below. Traditional texts and various commentaries on traditional Yoga texts are good sources of getting authentic information (Annexure 1). Yoga institutions, universities, and Yoga centers of higher learning, are imparting theoretical and practical education on Yoga (Annexure 2). Since 1920/21, Yoga practices have been subjected to modern laboratory examinations and investigations and literature based on these studies is available in the form of articles in journals, and magazines. The articles based on modern scientific thinking and analyses are being indexed in Pub Med and other medical database systems. These medical database systems comprising Yoga journals and Yoga magazines (Annexure 3) can be accessed to get reliable information. Traditional Knowledge Digital Learning (TKDL) departments are documenting Yoga literature. Networking with these centers would give reliable information on Yoga. In India, the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga (MDNIY), New Delhi, is actively engaged in this type of work. Manuscript libraries having a collection of Yoga manuscripts can be used for copying and publishing the information. 2.2 HOW TO IDENTIFY RELIABLE INFORMATION Identifying the reliability of the information on Yoga is an important but difficult task. Vast material is available on Yoga. However, it is based on subjectively experienced parameters. There is a lack of evidence-based studies to support the statements and claims made in various texts. Modern Yoga literature is prone to commercialism and advertisement. In reality, Yoga is more of an experiential science. It is essentially based on subjectively sensed, felt, and experienced parameters that could be monitored and suitably modified for the development of a right type of 'self-awareness' or consciousness working in a positive direction. In the absence CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA26 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of Indiaof self-experience, it is difficult to know the reliability of the information of the objectively studied parameters in laboratory conditions and vice versa. In the above scenario, the following suggestions may help a consumer ensure the reliability of information: Information should be verified by a competent, well-trained, and experienced Yoga teacher/expert. Yoga is used for various purposes such as for physical health, mental health, social health, and spiritual health. Consumers should decide what purpose he/she wants to practice Yoga. The consumer should ensure whether the information is suitable to his/her needs and purposes. If the information fulfills this criterion, then it may be taken as reliable. Consumers should rely more on their own experience with the outcome and the results of their Yoga practice. A consumer should also make sure that the information is accurate and upgraded. For this, the consumer should access it from authentic texts, websites, Government-approved/recognized institutions, Yoga centers and universities. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA27 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaCHAPTER 3 YOGA AS THERAPYCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA28 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA29 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India The World Health Organization has proposed reframing the statement to explore the fourth dimension of health - the Spiritual Well Being of individuals. Spiritual health has been defined as a state of being where an individual is able to deal with day-to-day life issues in a manner that leads to the realization of one's full potential, meaning and purpose of life and fulfilment from within. In the area of health for people, many psycho-medico-surgical procedures exist and are practiced in various healthcare systems around the world. However, when it comes to providing holistic health, most systems fall short, and many of them are expensive too. Moreover, the chemicals/drugs used in the conventional system are prone to give side effects to the users. Therefore, a need is being felt to explore a healthcare system that costs less and provides holistic health without side effects. In this context, Yoga as a therapy is getting recognition as a more capable system that can take care of not only of physical, mental, and social health, but spiritual health as well. Yoga was originally devised for people interested in pursuing a happy and blissful life. However, later Yoga was recognized as having huge potential for fitness and health. In recent times, Yoga has benefitted millions of people. Various research have highlighted the importance of Yogic practices for various physical health benefits. Its efficacy in the spiritual aspects of life is well-proven. It is giving promising results in the management of stress and tension-related psycho-somatic and functional disorders. Yoga is neither a sect nor an ideology. It is a methodology or science to practically train the mind and body. Regular practice of Yoga can give us three major outcomes: It makes us more aware of our natural wisdom. It strengthens the body's ability to recover from illness or injury. It teaches us how to behave with our bodies and society. 3.1 WHAT IS YOGA THERAPY? Yoga therapy may be defined as the application of Yogic principles to achieve physical, physiological, psychological, social, and spiritual well-being. Yoga therapy employs various Yogic concepts and techniques prescribed in traditional Yoga texts for prevention, management, and rehabilitation of diseases along with the promotion of general health. Yoga therapy aims at bringing holistic health to the individual. Yoga can act as preventive medicine if adopted as a way of life and living. 3.2 SALIENT FEATURES OF YOGA THERAPY 3.2.1 ADOPTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE It is important to adopt a holistic lifestyle and follow a healthy regimen to live a healthy and peaceful life. The modern world is facing a multitude of health issues due to lifestyle disorders. These quired lifestyle changes have to be made consciously by individuals themselves. Yoga places great importance on a proper and healthy lifestyle, the main components of which are listed below. 1. Achara: Yoga stresses the importance of healthy activities such as exercise (Vyayama) and recommends Asana , Pranayama , and Kriyas regularly. Good cardio-respiratory health is one of the main by-products of such healthy activities. 2. Vichara: Right thoughts and the right attitude towards life are vital for the well-being of an individual. A balanced state of mind is obtained by following moral restraints and ethical observances (Yama- Niyama ). As Mahatma Gandhi said, 'there is enough in this world for everyone's need but not enough for any one person's greed'. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA30 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3. Ahara: Yoga emphasizes the need for a healthy, nourishing diet that has an adequate intake of fresh water along with a well-balanced intake of fresh food, green salads, sprouts, unrefined cereals, and fresh fruits. It is important to be aware of the need for a Sattvic diet, prepared and served with love and affection. 4. Vihara: Proper recreational activities to relax the body and mind are essential for good health. This includes proper relaxation, maintaining quietude of action-speech-thoughts, and group activities wherein one loses the sense of individuality. Karma Yoga is an excellent method for losing the sense of individuality and gaining a sense of universality. 3.2.2 IMPORTANT CONCEPTS/FUNDAMENTALS OF YOGA THERAPY The Yoga therapy is based on the following doctrines and concepts: Doctrine of Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha, Kriya Yoga, Klesha-Tanu-Karana, Samadhi-Bhava, and Ashtanga as Patanjala's Yoga Sutras. Doctrine of Panchakosha (five sheaths/bodies) as elaborated in Upanishads. Doctrine of various kinds of Shuddhi is found in Patanjali 's Yoga Sutra and Hatha Yoga. Doctrine of opening blocked channels of Vayu and Prana (Nadishuddhi ), the opening of lotuses Pranayamas, and Drishtis as highlighted in Hatha Yoga and Kundalini Yoga. Working with the mind on the lines of Patanjali's Yoga Sutra, Mantra Yoga, and Hatha Yoga. Working on the lines of Karma-Jnana-Bhakti from the Bhagawad Gita. Certain aspects of Tantra Yoga also get integrated into various Yoga practices. 3.3 PRINCIPLES OF YOGA THERAPY 3.3.1 PRINCIPLES OF YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF KLESHAS AND VRITTIS Yoga is a path towards realization of the undisturbed true nature of the Self. In search of this spiritual goal, practitioners of Yoga have evolved this art and science from time immemorial. Yoga is a continuous experiential path that transcends various states of consciousness to ultimately merge with reality of the infinite pure consciousness featured by Kaivalya or eternal freedom. This state of Kaivalya can be attained only through Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha, which means cessation of all mental processes. Patanjali advocates the development of correct psychological attitudes such as Maitri (friendliness towards those who are at peace with themselves), Karuna (compassion for the suffering), Mudita (cheerfulness towards the virtuous), and Upeksha (indifference to and avoidance of evil) as the first step and then suggests the practice of Abhyasa Vairagya, Ashtanga Yoga , and Kriya Yoga of Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha and Chitta-Prasadana . Abhyasa means regular/punctual practice with patience and perseverance; Vairagya connotes virtual freedom from attachment and indulgence to all worldly things and all pleasures of life. The practice of Abhyasa and Vairagya leads to Vivekakhyati (discriminating wisdom). Kriya Yoga has three parts: (1) training and purifying the senses (Tapas), (2) self-study in the context of teachings (Svadhyaya ), and (3) devotion and letting go into the creative source from which we emerged (Ishvara-Pranidhana). The practice of both Abhyasavairagya and Kriya Yoga reduces the gross and subtle thought patterns (Vrittis and Kleshas ) such as thoughts/information perceived through the interaction with sense organs. This reduces the Kleshas into an attenuated state called Tanu , when the impulsiveness of the Kleshas is reduced.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA31 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaPatanjali advocates the practice of a graded course of meditation Ashtanga Yoga comprises Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, and which leads an individual to a state of Samadhi. The practice of Ashtanga Yoga burns the attenuated Kleshas with the light of Prajna (supersensible or sensitive or clarity of knowledge) known as Ritambhara Prajna (PYS,1.48). Attaining this state leads to revelation of the true nature of self-awareness/individualized consciousness (Purusha) and its distinctness from Buddhi known as Viveka-khyati . 3.3.2 PRINCIPLES OF YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PANCHA KOSHAS The application of Yoga as a therapy can be correlated with the Upanishadic model of Pancha Koshas (the five subjectively experienced modalities contributing to 'self-awareness' and our existence).This can be confirmed and supported by suitable objective investigations and studies. Yogic practices may be used as therapeutic interventions at different levels in this respect. At the Annamaya Kosha (awareness of the structural aspect of our existence), Yogic Sukshma Vyayam (simple movements of all body parts), Mudras (gestures for energy generation and conservation), Kriyas (structured movements), and Asanas (steady and comfortable postures), along with the dietary modifications, are useful. At the Pranamaya Kosha (awareness of the vital functional aspect of our existence), Shatkarmas (six cleansing processes), development of breath awareness, and working on the movement of breath, followed by various Pranayamas in coordination with an emphasis on balancing the Pranic energy, is to be done. Work on re-energizing and integrating the energies of the Pancha Pranas and different Vayus needs to be done at this level. At the Manomaya Kosha (awareness of the sensing and feeling aspects of our existence), numerous practices such as Trataka (concentrated gaze), Dharana (concentration), Dhyana (meditation), Japa, and Ajapa-Japa are useful. Various aspects of concentration/meditation such as Chakra Dharana and other Yoga Drishtis (gazing techniques) are also available in Yoga. An awareness of all aspects of the Antahkarana needs to be developed at this level. When trying to deal with the Vijnanamaya Kosha (awareness of the intellectual aspect of our existence), Swadhyaya (self-analysis), and Satsanga (lectures and spiritually uplifting exchange), along with Jnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, and relaxation and concentration practices of Yoga are useful.Ashtanga Yoga and Vrittis through Kriya Yoga and Ashtanga YogaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA32 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India To understand and work with the Anandamaya Kosha (awareness of the universal nature of our existence), it is important to lose the sense of the limited individuality. Learning to implement Karma Yoga (Yoga as skilled action performed without expectation) by following the principle of action in relaxation helps us to achieve a sense of joy in all activities. A realization that we live in a blissful universe and that all life is joy is to be brought about in this intervention through the use of Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga , and other aspects like Bhajana , Yogic counseling and Satsanga. 3.3.3 PRINCIPLES OF YOGA FOR PURIFYING THE BODY Hatha Yoga aims to create a balance among the activities and processes of the body, mind, and energy. This balance helps in developing awareness of the awakening of the central force followed by the energy movement in Sushumna Nadi in the region of the vertebral column (Meru Danda ), which is responsible for the evolution of human consciousness from the individual to the universal level. Purification of the Chakras and Nadis is the first step; the assumption is that the complete removal of impurities from the whole body purifies the Nadis through six different ways, which facilitates the flow of Prana. The purification processes are classified into six divisions and, therefore, they are often called Shatkriyas or Shatkarma. These are: (1) Dhauti, (2) (4) Trataka, (5) Nauli, and (6) Kapalabhati. The main effects of these Kriyas are as follows: 1. Cleansing, activating, and revitalising the organs; 2. Toning up the functions of the organs; 3. Desensitization and 4. Development of deep internal awareness. 3.3.4 PRINCIPLE OF YOGA FOR OPENING UP BLOCKED CHANNELS Practices of Kumbhakas, Pranayamas , Mudras , and Bandhas help to open up blocked channels of energy movement. Each of these is briefly explained below. (a) Kumbhaka Pranayama Developing awareness of the body/mind space in a 'filled state' at the end of Puraka (the process of filling) during Pranayama practice is called Antah Kumbhaka. While developing awareness of the body/ mind space in an 'empty state' at the end of Rechaka (the process of emptying) during Pranayama practice is called Bahya Kumbhaka. Awareness of 'stand stillness' without any directionality about the movement of breath, breathing movements, and various other parameters are termed Kevala Kumbhaka. (b) Mudra The word Mudra has different connotations in Yoga, which includes meditation practices. Mudras are most commonly associated with various hand gestures. The fingers are related to different types of energies and when they are brought together in specific ways, they produce subtle effects. Each Mudra serves a purpose such as enhancing energy, concentration, memory, and overcoming anxiety. The purpose of Mudras is also to control the involuntary physiological processes of the body. The practice of Mudras directs the flow of energy and thereby helps one to influence and regulate different systems of the body. Stimulation and balance of Sushumna and relieving stress and anxiety are achieved by practicing Mudras in daily life. Mudras also lead to the involvement of Prana and the development of awareness of the currents of Prana, which is the vital energy within the subtle body and sometimes steers Pranic healing. Important benefits of practicing Mudras are highlighted below.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA33 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Mudras prepare the mind for meditation, encourage the withdrawal of senses (Pratyahara), and make the mind focused. Mudras can help balance the flow of energy through the Nadis, which nourish our internal organs. Mudras can be performed to achieve specific states of consciousness. Mudras help in the elimination of negative thoughts and elevation of mood. Certain body positions are used as Mudras to influence the flow of energy. (c) Bandha Bandha is generally considered a 'lock'. It means to bind, to hold captive, or to contract. In Yoga terminology, Bandha is an action that binds or tightly holds the Prana . In other words, Bandhas are psychic locks used to raise the level of Prana and reverse the downward flow of Apana. In Hatha Yogic texts, Bandha signifies the muscular locking, which diverts the movement of Prana to Sushumna. There are mainly Bandha, Bandha, and Moola Bandha. The purpose of the Bandhas is to bind together the opposite poles of energy and accumulate the Shakti (power) in a particular center of the body through the contraction of muscles and organs in the physical body. The practices of Kumbhaka, Mudras , and Bandhas help in arousing the inherent energy or Prana by opening the blocked channels or Nadis, which helps in the free movement of Prana Shakti through Sushumna Nadi by opening the Chakras. (d) Other Yogic Practices to Attain Liberation Practice of Jnana Yoga: The present age of science has made human being a rational beings. Intellectual sharpness is imminent. Analysis forms the tool. Jnana Yoga helps to discriminate between the real and the unreal nature. Avidya (wrong knowledge) is the root cause of the perception of worldly phenomena as real; but in reality, it is not. The path of philosophy (Jnana Yoga) is apt for keen intellectuals and is centered on the analysis of 'reality and happiness', the vital contribution of the Upanishads. Also, many other fundamental questions regarding the mind, the outside world, and the inside world are taken up. Basic questions are raised even involving the intellect itself to reach the very basis of intellect and existence. Practice of Karma Yoga: This path of working in relaxation involves doing action with an attitude of detachment to the fruits of action. This makes a man/woman release himself/herself from strong attachments, bringing in him/her a steadiness of mind, which verily is Yoga (Samatvam Yogah Uchyate ). Instruments of action and understanding get cleansed through 2.48, 49). Practice of Bhakti Yoga: Control of emotions is key to the path of worship. This path involves pure love to the divine and is characterized by total surrender. In the age of globalization an individual is tossed up and down due to emotional onslaughts. The path of Bhakti is a boon to gain control over emotional instabilities by properly harnessing the energy involved in it. 3.3.5. COUNSELLING IN YOGA THERAPY Yoga is a preventive life science and hence Yogic counseling is a vital component of Yoga Chikitsa when dealing with all lifestyle disorders. The counseling process is not a 'one-off' matter but a continuous one that starts from the first visit and to every subsequent session at different levels. Helping the patients understand their condition, finding the root cause of the problem, and creating a healthy opportunity for them to change themselves is the Dharma of a therapist. Dharma is defined as doing the right thing for the right person at the right place and at the right time in the right manner. It may take many months before we start witnessing the benefit s of these Yogic lifestyle changes and Yoga Chikitsa practices. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA34 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3.4 MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN YOGIC PRACTICES A few mechanisms through which Yogic practices work as an integrated holistic mind-body medicine are listed below. Shatkarma cleanses the accumulated impurities (Ashuddhis). It internally cleanses different organs and systems of the body in the following ways. Dhauti cleanses the entire digestive tract. Vastra Dhauti (a type of Dhauti) scrubs the of the stomach; removes toxins from the balance there.Vaman Dhauti/Kunjala ( another type of Dhauti) helps to clean the stomach's unwanted food particles left over after digestion and also other toxins. Basti cleanses the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT). It has all the benefits of colonic douching. It washes the bowels; removes excessive heat and thread worms from the lower intestine; tones up the lower segment of the gut; and restores its sensitivity and responsiveness. The practice of Neti helps to remove accumulated injurious and harmful mucus from the nasal passage and generates a healthy mucous membrane. The benefit of Sutra Neti depends primarily on the physico-chemical and mechanical effects of rubbing. It scrubs off the dried-up secretions, irrigates it by fluid, and provides non-abrasive massaging. The use of slightly hypertonic saline, both in Sutraneti and Jalaneti , has an additional effect of causing a mild irritation to the mucosa. This increases circulation in the mucous membrane. Neti flushes the mucus out of the sinuses (the air-filled spaces in the facial bones) and keeps them healthy. It benefits the eyes also by opening the tear duct, which at one end opens into the nose. In Trataka, focusing on an unchanging/unwavering object results in habituation in brain. As a result, the brain stops registering that object indicating diminished visual attention to the external world. This 'habituation' increases alpha waves - a sign of relaxed state of the brain. In Nauli kriya, the rotation of the rectus abdominis muscles improves the mobility of various visceral organs. It activates the nerve plexuses and their fine terminals resulting in a better co- ordination among the autonomic functions. It also develops the capacity to produce negative pressure in the abdomen, which, on one hand, sucks up more blood in the abdomen, and on the other, allows greater control on the rate at which various substances can be ejected out of the abdomino-pelvic hollow viscera (e.g., the evacuation of faeces, urine, and other genito-urinary secretions). In Kapalabhati , rapid and forced exhalation is beneficial for brain. During normal exhalation, cerebrospinal fluid around the brain is decompressed resulting into slight expansion of the brain. In Kapalabhati, the forced and prolonged exhalation increases decompression of the fluid resulting in the increased expansion of the brain, which enhances the massaging effect on the brain. It also helps to expel more carbon dioxide and other waste gases from the cells and lungs as compared to normal exhalation. Sukshma Vyayama (simple movements of different joints) generates a sense of relaxation and lightness by improving blood circulation and flow of energy. It helps to prevent infections or disorders that may occur due to stagnation of pathogens in different areas of the body caused by poor mobility. Adoption of a Yogic lifestyle with proper nourishing diet creates positive antioxidant enhancement thus neutralising free radicals while enabling rejuvenation of the storehouse of nutrients packed with life energy to work on anabolic, reparative, and healing processes.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA35 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Postures (Asanas ) work in the following ways: Different physical postures held steadily and comfortably without strain and executing suitable actions steady the entire body. It enhances physical balance and a sense of ease with oneself, which, in turn, enhances mental/emotional balance and enables all physiological processes to occur healthily. Integrated body movements with the breath in the Asanas create psychosomatic harmony. In Yoga, the awareness of the physical body is understood and designated as Annamaya kosha representing our structural existence. It is essentially connected with the state of body musculature (tone, tension, contraction, etc.). Awareness of mental activities is understood as Manomaya Kosha (our psychological existence). Awareness of the flow of breath and breathing movements representing vital functions and serving as a bridge between the physical and the mental bodies is understood as the Pranayama Kosha. Working intelligently with the breath becomes the key to developing psychosomatic harmony. Breathing patterns and Pranayama work in the following ways: These improve control over autonomic respiratory mechanisms. The mind and emotions are related to the pattern and rate of our breathing. Therefore, the slowing down of the breathing process positively influences the functioning of the autonomic nervous system, metabolic processes, and emotional responses thereby generating energy and enhancing emotional stability. Retention of breath (Kumbhaka) in Pranayamas ensures the better exchange of carbon dioxide with oxygen resulting in more supply of oxygen. Similarly, prolonged exhalation ensures the pushing out of carbon dioxide and other toxins in a better way. Focus of the mind on activities being done enhances energy flow and results in proper/efficient circulation in different body parts and internal organs. Where the mind goes, there the Prana flows. Contemplative practices create a calm internal environment, which, in turn, enables normalization of homeostatic mechanisms. Yoga is all about balance or Samatvam at all levels of being. Mental balance produces physical balance and vice versa too. Physical and Mental techniques relax the body-emotion-mind complex that enhances our pain threshold and coping ability in responding to external and internal stressors. This enhances the quality of life as seen in so many terminal cases where other therapies are not able to offer any solace. Cultivation of right attitudes towards life and moral-ethical living through Yama-Niyama and various Yogic psychological principles enhances faith, self-confidence, and inner strength, which are essential for healing, repair, rejuvenation, and re-invigoration. Yoga works towards restoration of normalcy in all systems of the human body with special emphasis on the psycho-neuro-immuno-endocrine axis. In addition to its preventive and restorative capabilities, Yoga also aims at promoting positive health that will help us to tide over health challenges that occur during our lifetime. This concept of positive health is one of Yoga's unique contributions to modern healthcare as Yoga has both a preventive and promotive role in the healthcare of our masses. It is also inexpensive and can be used in tandem with other systems of medicine in an integrated manner to benefit pa tients.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA36 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3.5. LI MITATIONS OF YOGA THERAPY Yoga therapy is useful in bringing about holistic health, but it has its limitations also. Certain situations where Yoga therapy may not be useful are as listed below. Yoga therapy is based on the assumption that each person is unique. Therefore, a therapy-plan for a person suffering from a certain medical condition may not be suitable for another person suffering from the same medical condition. Therefore, therapy has to be moulded to suit the individual need. Yoga therapy may not be useful in medical emergency conditions or for getting immediate relief. It is based on lifestyle and requires regular practice and is to be incorporated into the daily routine. It also requires regular monitoring by the therapist. It may not be useful for assessment for diagnosis and for evaluating its outcome. For diagnosis and assessment of its outcome, one has to depend on the tools of modern medical science. It should not be a replacement/alternative for medical therapy especially in cases of infectious diseases. 3.6 THERAPEUTIC CLAIMS 3.6.1 USES DESCRIBED IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS Traditional texts, especially Hatha Yogic texts, make several claims about the benefits of Yoga. Gheranda Samhita, Hatha Pradeepika, Hatha Ratnavali, etc. make practices such Shatkarmas, Asanas, and Pranayama . Different Yoga systems have focused their attention on different aspects of life and the living of human beings. Yoga texts mention that Yoga is the most effective and ultimate medicine (Parama Aushadhi) for stress-related ( Bhava-Tapas) functional disorders. Upanishads work with the doctrine and concept of Pancha Koshas .This doctrine can be understood as five kinds of inputs contributing to the development of the awareness of 'Self'. Patanjala Yoga Sutras have given importance to Chitta-Vritti-Nirodha, i.e., controlling and abolishing the disturbing behavioral modifications (Klishtavrittis ) of the restless mind (Chitta ). Tantra Yoga and Hatha Yoga have given importance to the working of neuro-muscular and sensory activities involved in the formation and functioning of the mind and to use them in developing and maintaining an integrated and balanced state of mind and self-consciousness ( Samadhi). Mantra Yoga has used repetitive chanting of various sounds/words/vibrations (Mantras ) to work with the 'Self'. It must be noted that the letters of the alphabet used in talking, singing, and Mantra recitation remain the same. 3.6.2 USES VALIDATED BY EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH WORK There are several research projects undertaken by various hospitals and medical centers that focus on (a) validating the therapeutic claims made by traditional Yoga texts and (b) understanding the modus operandi of different Yoga practices. Modern research shows that Yoga can play a major role in the prevention of diseases and can provide promising results in the maintenance and promotion of health. Yoga has been found to be beneficial in the management of the following disorders: Endocrine and metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus (DM), obesity, thyroid disorders, and metabolic syndrome. Studies conducted by Malhotra, et al. (2006) and Cohen, et al. (2008) show significant improvement in the management of diabetes and metabolic syndrome, respectively, after the intervention of Yoga.1 1 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+endocrine+disordersCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA37 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Cardiovascular disorders like Hypertension (HT), Coronary Artery Disease (CAD), Atherosclerosis, Arrhythmias, Cardiac Rehabilitation. Manchanda et al. (2000) found beneficial effects of Yoga lifestyle intervention in the retardation of Coronary Atherosclerosis (RCT) in patients with severe coronary artery disease. In a review article, Jayasinge S.R. (2004) evaluated the practical significance and suitability of incorporating Yoga into the comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program. He found that the majority of the rehabilitation workers believe that non-conventional forms of physical exercises such as Yoga helps to enhance the efficacy and value.2 Respiratory and ENT disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), sinusitis, and rhinitis. Choudhary et al. (2012) found the regular practice of Jalaneti and Bhramari Pranayama is effective in the management of chronic rhino sinusitis. The Yogic intervention for 8 weeks resulted in a significant reduction of inflammation in patients suffering from chronic rhino sinusitis. Soni et al. (2012) conducted a control-group study on COPD patients. Daily practice of Yoga (comprising Pranayama s and a few selected Yoga postures) for 45 minutes for two months resulted in the improvement of diffusion capacity in patients in the Yoga group. Yogic breathing exercises have been found to improve diffusion capacity thereby benefitting COPD patients. It was suggested that Yoga can be used as an adjunct therapy along with conventional medical therapy.3 Musculo skeletal disorders such as lumbago, neck pain, and arthritis. A pilot study conducted by Ulgor et al. (2011) using a Yoga program consisting of Asanas , stretching exercises, and breathing techniques as intervention (2 sessions weekly for 4 weeks) resulted in significant improvement in gait and balance of the women suffering from musculo- skeletal disorders. A review article by Sharma (2014) studied the efficacy of Yoga in alleviating the symptoms of arthritis. Six out of 9 interventions from 2000 to June 2013 were found to demonstrate positive effects on psychological or physiological outcome measures related to arthritis. The limitations of these studies are (a) a smaller sample size, (b) they had different outcome measures and varying lengths of intervention, and (c) not all studies used a controlled design.4 Psychiatric disorders such as stress, anxiety depression, bipolar affective disorder (BPAD), and insomnia. In a randomised comparative trial conducted by Smith et al. (2007), Yoga for 10 weeks as treatment modality was found to be as effective as relaxation in reducing stress, anxiety, and improving the health status; however, no difference was found between two groups after 16 weeks. The study concluded that Yoga as compared to relaxation provided comparable improvement in reducing anxiety and stress. A review by Meyer et al. (2012) found Yoga as having therapeutic benefits in the management of neurological and major psychiatric conditions. However, the review highlighted the need for more randomized, controlled studies to critically define the benefits of Yoga for both neurological and psychiatric disorders.5 Obstetrics and gynecological conditions such as prenatal, postnatal, hypertension gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), dysmenorrhea, polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), pelvic muscle weakness, and infertility. 2 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+cardio+vascular+disorders 3 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+respiratory+disorders 4 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+arthritis 5 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+psychiatric+disordersCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA38 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaIn a study conducted by Hawrelak and Myers (2009), a pre-natal Yoga program comprising 30 minutes of Yoga practice at least three times a week during the last 10-12 weeks of pregnancy was found effective in facilitating maternal comfort during and after labor, decreasing pain during labor, and shortening the duration of labor. Narendran et al. (2005) found the higher birth weights of babies, and lower preterm labor in the Yoga group. Complications such as isolated intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) and pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) with associated IUGR were also significantly lower in the Yoga group. No significant adverse effects were noted in the Yoga group. Young wanich setha et al. (2014) found improvement in glycemic control in the intervention group when compared to the control group. The study used mindfulness eating and Yoga for pregnant women suffering from GDM.6 Urological disorders such as urinary incontinence, recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI), and erectile dysfunction. Huang et al. (2014) found preliminary evidence of the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of Yoga therapy intervention in middle-aged and older women with urinary incontinence.7 Neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. In a review article, Mishra et al. (2012) found that Yoga has been widely used as an adjunctive treatment modality for carpal tunnel syndrome, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, post-stroke paresis, and neuropathy of Type-II diabetes. However, the article emphasized the need for additional research on the safety and efficacy of Yoga therapy as most of the studies reviewed were found to have inadequacies in their design, especially sample sizes, and the employment of methods of controls, randomization, and blinding.8 From the above discussion, it is clear that Yoga can be used as therapy. However, more research is required in this area. There is a paucity of widely disseminated, objectively conducted 'evidence-based studies', which can support the traditional claims made by different Yoga traditions. The reason is that Yoga is a subjectively-felt experiential system. Due to its subjectively-felt effects, it is difficult to gather evidence on objective parameters used in other medical systems. Therefore, the guidelines used in other systems of medicine cannot be strictly applied to the discipline of Yoga. Another issue regarding pieces of evidence about therapeutic claims is related to Yogic intervention used in the studies for therapeutic purposes. The yogic intervention used in the studies consists of several Yogic practices and techniques where it is difficult to assess the therapeutic benefits of every such practice and technique separately. 3.7 QUALITY OF YOGA INSTRUCTIONS USED IN THERAPY Like other systems of medicine, the quality of therapy is an important issue. Authors of modern literature on Yoga often use 'disclaimers' and avoid taking responsibility to guide the consumers (Sadhakas) through their writings. Many books are seen to use a 'technique-oriented' approach and individuals cannot find useful hints for their personal use. The teaching institutions need to go beyond the syllabus-oriented approach to engage students in a much more meaningful manner. The teachers and the students may not give due importance to the subjective/experiential nature and aspect of Yoga practices. Therefor e, the assessment methodology may have to be modified in such a 6 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+pregnancy 7 For more research details, please visit: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Yoga+for+urinary+incontinence 8 For more research details, please click the URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/?term=Yoga+in+neurological+disordersCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA39 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of Indiaway that reflects the desired outcome of Yoga practices for individuals. In this scenario, ensuring the quality of Yoga therapy assumes greater significance. To ensure good quality Yoga therapy, the following suggestions may be useful. An individual should learn and practice Yoga under the guidance of a Yoga expert or well-trained Yoga teacher. The quality of instructions and training imparted by teachers of living Yoga traditions (Guru-Shishya Parampara) is different because they look for proper and correct responses and outcomes of the Yoga practices. These teachers feel responsible for ensuring the success of their consumers ( Sadhakas) through these instructions. In addition to the above, videos developed by Yoga institutions having authentic information can be used for practicing Yoga. Attempts are being made to develop good-quality films to preserve and promote authentic instructional material to the practitioners. 3.8 PRECAUTIONS Traditional Yoga texts and those following the 'teacher-student tradition' (Guru -Shishya Parampara) mention precautions in the form of do's and don'ts for different practices. Modern books, films, and live demonstrations generally show ideal body positions to be adopted during various Yoga postures. For any beginner, it may not be possible to perform and achieve the final position and maintain it easily for a certain length of time. Most of the time, a beginner tries to copy and compare one's position with the ideal/final position and oversteps one's capacities and limitations. This may prove to be harmful. An over-enthusiastic individual may thus sustain injury and land in trouble by ignoring the precautions. Following precautions will be useful for beginners in Yoga: Traditional Yoga is a procedure-based, subjectively experienced system. It should be practiced under the guidance of a competent, well-trained Yoga teacher or expert, who can understand the functioning of the body and mind and importance and implications of internally aroused sensations and knowledge. One should try to remain aware of one's physical limitations and learn to practice within the scope and limitations of one's body framework, psycho-physical, and psycho-physiological make-ups, and configurations. Otherwise, one can easily cross one's limits and sustain injuries. Many Yoga techniques require the consumer (Sadhaka )/stakeholder to work with the 'flow of in-breath and out-breath' and the gross body movements related to breathing under the generic term Pranayama . Being a vital activity, one has to be careful while working with these parameters. Otherwise, vital functions can get disturbed. Later on, the individual is expected to be working with one's memories, emotions, feeling states, thoughts, and actions. Again, one has to be careful while working with these parameters. Yoga is used in many ways and for different aims and objectives, namely, business, profession, service, guidance, education, therapy, career, demonstration, and exhibition. One should be discriminative and selective in respect of what one wants from Yoga and how to get it to fulfill/ achieve one's needs and requirements in the best possible way. The conventional healthcare provider/Yoga teacher or therapist should be informed about one's health status before undertaking Yoga practices to avoid any adverse outcomes from Yoga practices. Indications and contra-indications should be respected and followed properly to avoid adverse event s. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA40 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India3.9 PRE-REQUISITES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL FOR YOGA PRACTICES Yama (restraints) and Niyama (observances) are essential requirements for Yoga practitioners. There are five Yamas and five Niyamas possess beyond actual needs). The five Niyamas are Shaucha (internal and external purity), Santosha (contentment), Tapas (austerity), Swadhyaya (studying scriptures to acquire the right knowledge), and Ishwarpranidhana (surrendering to God). A Yoga practitioner should follow these to the maximum. In the renowned Hatha Yogic text, Gheranda Samhita, Maharishi Gheranda outlines essential prerequisites to be observed prior to engaging in the practice of Pranayama . According to the text, individuals should adhere to certain guidelines, which include determining the appropriate time and place for practice, observing Mitahara (moderate and balanced diet), and performing Nadi Shuddhi (purification of energy channels). These preparatory steps are emphasized as important foundations to establish before delving into the profound practice of Pranayama . By incorporating these prerequisites, practitioners can enhance the effectiveness and benefits of their Pranayama practice while ensuring a harmonious and conducive environment for their spiritual journey. Moderate food (Mitahara) is advised for better results. Oily and spicy food, smoking, drinking liquor, etc. should be avoided. Yogic practices performed under the influence of alcohol or consciousness- altering drugs may not give desirable results and outcomes. Regular, continuous practice and faith are additional requirements for getting good results. Yogic practices should be performed with awareness of the body. An individual should be aware of the state/condition of different body parts involved in the specific practice. One needs to develop the ability to withdraw one's mind/attention from the outside world and bring it inwards. It is advisable to work with an accomplished teacher and master this practice as early as possible. Reading, contemplation, and reflection on traditional Yoga texts will help resolve any doubts or queries about Yoga. 3.10 ADVERSE EVENTS Yoga is generally safe if learnt and practiced properly and intelligently. However, its improper use can be harmful. Sometimes, unintended and undesirable events may occur if necessary precautions are not taken during Yogic practices. Traditional Yoga texts also caution about the possibility of such adverse effects of Yoga practice. Adverse effects of Yogic practices are being reported in medical journals, newspapers, and other magazines from time to time. There may be several causes of the adverse events. The adverse effects may be caused by non-uniformity in the understanding about life, living, and existence between the teacher/therapist and the student/patient. The therapist and the patient may not have the same educational and cultural background, due to which interpersonal communication becomes difficult and non-effective. Yoga practices may be harmful if the patient does not reveal his/her medical conditions to the Yoga therapist. The person (stakeholder) may over-use, misuse, or abuse learning and practice of Yoga; or may not use them adequately. Misuse of Yoga techniques can be dangerous. All Yoga practices should initially be done under proper supervision. Any adverse event like any kind of pain, agitation or problems in breathing should be appropriately informed to the therapist or the instructor. In case of any adverse event, Yoga practice should be immediately suspended till proper guidance is available. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA41 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Yoga is a procedure-based therapy. Yoga consumers need to follow the procedures and techniques properly. Unintended and undesirable events may occur if the consumers do not follow the right procedure. Yoga prescribes adoption of certain body positions termed Asana (posture). Beginners or perfectionists can sustain injury if they do not grasp and understand the guiding principles in adopting and maintaining these positions. An over-enthusiastic individual may tear crucial ligaments of the knee joint in order to sit with crossed legs (Padmasana ). One may sustain injury to the cervical spine during topsy-turvy positions (standing on the head or shoulders). While working with breath and breathing during Pranayama , people can disturb other vital functions while attempting forced breath-holding with different ratios beyond their capacity due to the wrong understanding of the term Kumbhaka (filled state of a container). For Shatkarmas/Shatkriyas (Yogic cleansing practices), the consumer (Sadhaka) has to be careful and perform these practices under the guidance of an able Yoga teacher. If guidelines are not followed, unintended and undesirable event may take place. For example, a person can experience a headache. Water can enter the ear passages (Eustachian tubes) if Jalneti is not performed properly. Similarly, a person can bleed from the nose during the process of Sutra-Neti if the catheter is forced along blocked passages. The consumers of Yoga should remember that these events are preventable by taking proper precautions. It is, therefore, advised that Yoga practices should be performed under the guidance of a Yoga expert or a certified Yoga instructor. 3.11 INTERACTIONS AND CONTRA-INDICATIONS 3.11.1 INTERACTIONS Yoga is a drugless system of therapy. It is generally safe if practiced under proper guidance and with good understanding. Yoga can be practiced along with conventional and other systems of complementary and alternative medicines. There are several systems of Yoga, each comprising certain components, aspects, and practices. For example, Patanjala Yoga Sutras (PYS) mention eight aspects (Ashta-Angas mentions aspects (Chatur-Angas ); Gheranda Samhita mentions six aspects (Shad-Angas ); and so on. Bauddha tradition mentions eight pathways ( Ashta-Marga). All the components, aspects, and practices mentioned in various traditional Yoga systems can be conveniently employed and practiced in an interactive manner. However, from time to time, due importance may be given to any one system according to the needs of the consumer/stakeholder to develop a sense of balance, integration, and equilibrium. 3.11.2 CONTRA-INDICATIONS Yoga is generally safe; however, there are certain conditions where certain practices are not to be practiced to avoid adverse events. The contra-indications can be broadly categorised as follows: Age-related contra-indications are related to the age of the practitioner. Persons of a specific period, such as children or older people, should not perform certain practices. For example, for old persons, Asanas involving extreme bending or maintaining the Asanas for long are contra- indicated. In the same way, in the case of children, subjectively experienced parameters in Yogic practices cannot be monitored and modified.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA42 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Gender-specific contra-indications are related to the gender of the practitioner. Some practices are not to be practiced by the specific gender. For example, Mayurasana is not advised for females as it causes too much pressure on their reproductive organs. Disease and body conditions-specific contra-indications indicate that a person with a certain illness or condition should not practice specific Yogic practices. Some Yogic practices are not advised in acute infections, life-threatening conditions, poisoning, burns, fractures, and psychiatric conditions. For example, forward-bending practices should not be practiced by persons suffering from back-ache or cervical spondylitis; Bhastrika Pranayama should not be practiced by a person having high blood pressure. Prone - lying Asana are contra-indicated during pregnancy; similarly, except for certain meditative and relaxing postures, Yogic practices are generally not advised during menstruation. Psycho-physical conditions-specific contra-indications specify the limitation related to the state of body and mind. For example, Yogic practices should not be performed in a state of fatigue, when the mind and body cannot work properly. Dynamic practices such as Surya - Namaskara should not be done in a hyper-mental state. Yogic practices should not be performed with a full stomach. Climate and weather-related contra-indications specify the unsuitable climatic condition for certain Yoga practices. For example, Kunjal kriya is not advised during the rainy season; Pranayama should not be practiced in the open during heavy winds. Sheetali and Seetkari Pranayamas are not to be practiced during cold conditions. 3.12 POSOLOGY OF YOGA: HOW MUCH YOGA IS GOOD? The approach of Yoga is quite different from the approach adopted in physical exercises, body-building practices, fitness programmes, games, sports, dancing, singing, talking, physiotherapeutic exercises, martial arts, and such other psycho-physical or psycho-physiological practices, where external tools and means are used to get objectively measurable and visible results outside the body. All kinds of Yoga, if properly understood, learnt, and practiced under the supervision of a competent teacher (Guru ) or expert, are helpful and give positive results. Different schools of Yoga employ different approaches for individuals with different psycho-physical and psycho-physiological configurations. Even the same school of Yoga adopts different approaches depending on individual differences. The reason attributed is that in Yoga, it is accepted that 'No two individuals are alike'.Therefore, there cannot be one universal Yoga programme, even though the final aim of all Yoga systems is the same,i.e., self-knowledge leading to freedom, emancipation, and realization of the universal nature of the so-called limited individualised consciousness. However, general prescriptions may be given as follows: It is recommended that practicing Yogic techniques once or twice a day for a duration of 45 minutes will be beneficial for beginners. But the condition and ability of the practitioner also is an important factor. The rationale for the duration is that the session of Yoga practice should not be very long. Yoga sessions should have a time limit that could be decided by the Yoga expert/ teacher/therapist as per convenience and need of the consumer. There are so many practices that can be put under broad categories such as Asana, Shatkarma , Pranayama, one session, Yogic practices from each category are generally combined depending upon the consumer's needs. Duration for all practices in a session should specifically be i ndicated.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA43 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Yogic practices and techniques are to be performed under the supervision of a competent and trained Yoga therapist. All precautions and contra-indications should be strictly followed while practicing Yoga. Yoga implies a healthy lifestyle requiring conscious efforts to inculcate healthy food habits, relaxation, positive thinking, positive attitudes, and positive actions. Yoga being a procedure-based therapy implies that the correct procedure is to be followed by the consumers/practitioners ( Sadhaka). 3.13 METHODS OF ADMINISTRATION Yoga therapy is different from other therapies because it is individual-oriented. There are a large number of Yogic practices that are available for therapeutic purposes. These practices can be put in the following broad (right actions), and Mantra japa (repetitive chanting of the same syllabus or mantra). While administering Yogic practices, the sequence or order of the practices and the number of repetitions remain an important issue. Here, it is essential to mention that there is no fixed pattern regarding the sequence and the number of repetitions, as it depends on the orientation of the teacher. Depending upon the condition of practitioner/consumer, some practices are more emphasised and repeated many times. However, one thing is clear that various practices are combined together in one session to get good results. The following steps can be adopted in Yoga therapy: The therapy starts with deep-breathing and self-awareness. Breathing practices, relaxation, and meditation are an integral part of regular practice not only to induce relaxation but also to raise the level of self-awareness. Yoga Nidra and Shavasana are examples in this respect. Highly traditional Yoga practices start with the lesson to dissociate the mind from the sensory objects, events, and happenings in the outside world. Thus, we learn to give rest to the five sensory faculties and start getting connected (Yoga) with the physical body from the inside. This helps in creating awareness about the body, about the breath and breathing, and about the mind. However, this may not work well in cases of children and persons with low intelligence. One is guided to develop body-awareness through proprioception so that areas of tension, pain, and other disturbing messages reaching the mind can be recognized along with their intensity. Making a mental or written note of this observation could be considered a kind of 'Yoga Diagnosis' related to the 'Structural Existence' as experienced by the individual'. This will help in developing a proper protocol for self-management at the physical level through suitable Yoga practices. Later, one is educated to sense, feel, experience, and recognize the flow of in-breath and out- breath, the speed of the movement of the breath, its experiential pathway, and its destination inside the body. This observation may be treated as another kind of 'Yoga Diagnosis' related with the 'vital or functional aspect as experienced by the individual'. In another lesson, one is educated to sense, feel, experience, and recognize the gross body movements related with natural, spontaneous, involuntary breathing at different horizontal levels of the trunk corresponding to the concept of 'Lotuses' or 'Chakras ' in the traditional Yogic literature. This is yet another way of establishing 'Yoga Diagnosis' in respect of the 'vital functional aspect as experienced by the individual' to develop treatment protocols for the practitioner/stakeholder.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA44 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Similarly, one is helped to recognise positive, negative, and/or neutral nature of memories, feelings, emotions, thoughts, and actions, which are directly related with the psyche or the mind (Antah-Karana) of the person. Data collected in respect of various subjectively (internally) experienced and monitored parameters associated to the physical structure, breath and breathing representing vital aspects, memories, feelings, thoughts, emotions, and the quality of one's life, and living are used to establish different kinds of 'Yogic Diagnosis' in respect of important components contributing the formation, development, and operation of (human) consciousness. Help of modern ways of studying the functioning of the internal (vital) organs along with modern and ancient medical diagnostic procedures are useful and should be taken into consideration to formulate suitable Yoga Education-cum-Treatment protocols to guide the practitioners/ consumers. Self-responsibility is an important condition for improving the health. Consumers should be motivated to develop a basic understanding of healthy lifestyle, awareness of proper posture, proper breathing, proper diet, rest, and relaxation. They should be helped to get guided by the flow of breath through important pathways or channels inside the body. In the longer run, these understandings will inculcate positive attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle. The practices should be chosen carefully as per the medical conditions, age, ability, and other requirements of the individual. 3.14 SELF-LEARNING AND SELF-PRACTICE OF YOGA Yoga therapy requires an active role on the part of a consumer/practitioner, but, at the same time, self-medication, especially for beginners, is not advisable. Many times a person starts performing Yoga on his/her own. This may sometimes prove harmful. At the initial stage, close supervision of a Yoga expert is encouraged or rather required. Traditionally, every aspirant (stakeholder) requires to be initiated (Diksha ) for using Yogic practices properly to avoid injuries and accidents. Initiation is followed by proper education (Shiksha) so that the aspirant use different Yoga techniques with the right attitude and for the right purpose. 'Do-It-Yourself' kind of Yoga literature may not be useful as each individual is unique and requires an individualized package. Therefore, in the beginning, an individual should avoid self-practice of Yoga. He/she should learn the techniques of Yogic practices under the supervision of a Yoga expert/ therapist until he/she is capable of continuing the practices on his/her own. Afterwards, regular self-practice may be continued as per one's requirements and capacity. In this regard, the following points are to be taken care of. During or self-guided practice, the consumer should follow all precautions and guidelines. He/ she should always notify if there is no improvement, or if some adverse events or symptoms arise during and/or after Yoga practice. Yoga is a procedure-based therapy. There is no shortcut to any practice. During self-guided practice, it has to be ensured that the proper procedure is followed. For this, all the steps involved in a Yogic practice should be duly followed by the consumer. Writing a personal diary regarding the Yoga practice may be useful during self-guided practice.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA45 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India The consumers can take the help of publications that explain the practices and techniques. However, consumers should ensure that the publications are published by reputed Yoga institutions such as MDNIY, SVYASA, Kaivalyadhama, Bihar School of Yoga, etc., and like Swami Sivananda, late B.K.S. Iyengar, T Krishnamacharya, etc. These publications may be of immense use to well- educated and well-informed Yoga students of this system. It must be emphasised again and again that the important role of a teacher and guide in the initial stage of Yoga learning cannot be replaced by any other substitute in traditional Yoga. However, well-made illustrative animation films with a good and clear commentary by experienced Yoga practitioners may certainly serve useful purpose in the direction of self-learning and self-education to manage one's condition.

This preparation for 'Yoga Education-cum-Therapy' involves the following: Certain Yoga practices require preparations such as selecting a proper place, suitable time, material for sitting, food, society, and environment. Therefore, these parameters considered carefully to get proper results and effects from Yoga practices. In consultation with various Yoga institutions and based on the results of the available research materials, MDNIY, New Delhi, has prepared protocols for people suffering from most common clinical conditions such as asthma, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. Books and films are also being prepared in this regard. Literature of similar nature published by the Bihar School of Yoga, SYASA, and B.K.S. Iyengar is also available in the market. It is advisable that the consumers who are willing to undergo 'Yoga Education-cum-Therapy' should have preliminary sessions to sensitise themselves in respect of the following parameters: 1. Developing the ability to withdraw one's mind from the external world for some time in order to work with Yoga practices. Usually, we spend most of our time and life in work outside the body. 2. Developing awareness of the condition of one's physical body at rest, e.g., areas of tension, pain, heaviness, heat, and tremors. 3. Developing awareness of body movements related to spontaneous, natural, involuntary breathing and voluntary breathing (inhalation and exhalation) so that these movements could be corrected if found to be wrong and/or disturbed. 4. Developing an attitude to observe and witness the memories, feelings, emotions, thoughts, etc., if aroused during Yoga practices. 5. Thus, everyone has to prepare one's body, breath, breathing, and mind for the practice of Yoga in the proper way and in the right direction to get optimum results in a reasonable time. Cleansing processes of Hatha Yoga (Shuddhi Kriyas or Shatkarmas) require suitable materials for their practice. For example, plastic tube or nasal catheter for Jala-neti; about 45-cm-long cotton threads prepared in a special way for Sutra-neti; muslin cloth strip (7-8 cm width and of suitable length) for Vastra-dhauti; warm water with salt for Jala-neti, Vamana-dhauti, Shankha-prakshalana, Basti, and Vajroli kriyas; clean air for Kapalbhati and other breathing techniques, etc. All these materials should be of good quality. The consumers should take proper guidance from the therapist before self-practice. 4.2 CHILDREN, PREGNANT WOMEN, LACTATING MOTHERS, AND ELDERL Y Yoga is a 'procedure-based education-cum-therapy' and is generally safe, if learnt and practiced properly. Right from the age of 8 to 9 years onwards, Yoga is available to one and all irrespective of caste, creed, sex, nationality, belief system, and religion. The old, very old, ill, and terminally ill people can be the learners and the practitioners of Yoga according to their needs, wants, and aspirations. However, proper instructions and special precautions are required for children, pregnant and lactating women, and elderly individuals, as their health statuses and needs are different. Therefore, Yogic practices and techniques are to be carefully selected and modified so as cater to their health status, special needs. Suitable modules and guidelines have been prepared by MDNIY and are available for use by different groups of individuals.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA50 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India4.2.1 CHILDREN Children need such practices that will help in the physical, mental, moral, and spiritual development of their personality. Active practices of repetitive nature will prove more beneficial and effective in this respect. The National Educational System provides 'Career Oriented Education' according to the potential talents, skills, capacities, and inbuilt configuration of the children. Traditional Yoga education is expected to make them aware of their human nature. In Indian tradition, in certain communities, around the age of 9 years, the boys are introduced to the Yogic breathing technique of 'alternate nostril breathing' while maintaining a stable and comfortable sitting position with a 'let-go' feeling (Asana ). After this kind of Pranayama , the child is taught the recitation of 'AUM' or 'OM' and Gayatri ' or Savitari Mantra. Slowly, they are introduced to recitation of other important Mantras and worshiping the family deity in 16 ways. The system of 'Salutation to the Sun' (Surya Namaskara) is the best for growing children to take care of their body, mind and spirit. It is being taught in many Indian schools, gymnasiums, and at homes. The overall logic, aims, and objectives of this practice and the modus operandi need to be properly highlighted to bring out the secular and universal nature of this system. Certain Yogic practices connected with withdrawal from the outside world (Pratyahara) and meditation on the self should be avoided for small children as these practices require focused attention on the 'self' inside the body. These practices are contrary to the basic nature of children and, therefore, are to be avoided. 4.2.2 PREGNANT WOMEN Yoga can and should be practiced during pregnancy under proper supervision and guidance after consultation with the doctor. Many antenatal care centers are giving instructions in Yoga practices. Well-illustrated and properly written books on 'Yoga for pregnant women' with Yoga protocols for different trimesters are available in the market. MDNIY is also working on these lines, and their literature will be available in the near future. Many antenatal clinics and Yoga centers are running regular classes and workshops for pregnant women. There are certain practices and techniques to be avoided or modified during pregnancy. There are suitable Yoga postures (Asanas ), which can be adopted by pregnant women to reduce their back pain; for prevention of abortions and miscarriages; for taking care of the swelling of the feet; and to prepare them for normal delivery. Women are taught to learn about the strong contraction of the chest muscles during exhalation to develop the downward-acting force during labor pains (bearing down) to assist the movement of the foetus through the birth canal in antenatal clinics. However, they are not made aware of the possibility of developing disturbing conditions such as the prolapsed uterus, hernias, urine incontinence if they continue breathing even after the delivery. Yoga teachers should make pregnant women aware of such a possibility so that they can follow the right way of breathing according to the concept of the working of Prana-Vayu and Apana-Vayu in Yoga. Recitation of suitable sounds with the right way of breathing according to the Yogic concept of Prana- Apana-Vayus could be used during pregnancy to have a tranquillising and positive effect on the growth of the foetus. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA51 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Simple stretching practices for the spine, based on Yogic concepts, could help pregnant women to take care of back pains. Pregnant women need to be advised on what not to be done during the different stages of pregnancy. 4.2.3 LACTATING WOMEN (YOGA FOR WOMEN AFTER DELIVERY) A Yoga teacher can guide women after delivery to assist them in the natural and proper involution of the uterus, to tone up the muscles of the lower abdominal wall, which were overstretched during pregnancy. Yogic practices include gentle twists, which can help to bring the uterus, pelvic floor, and abdominal muscles back to normal. Women should be made aware of the importance and necessity of returning to the naturally correct breathing habits based on the Yogic concept of Prana and Apanavayus as soon as possible after delivery. This will work like preventive measures to protect women from developing incontinence of urine, prolapsed uterus, and such other disturbing conditions due to (wrong) breathing habits related to bearing down during labor pains, which may continue after delivery. It is usually recommended to start Postpartum Yoga practice after three to six weeks of recovery time after a vaginal birth and longer after a caesarean. Postpartum Yoga is a modified, low-intensity Yoga practice consisting of breathing practices, Pranayama and relaxation techniques. It is advised to start Yoga practice under the guidance and supervision of a physician or yoga therapist. 4.2.4 ELDERL Y PERSONS Elderly people start experiencing and manifesting various kinds of health-related problems, which may impair the efficient functioning and working of different faculties and abilities important for leading normal productive social, family, and office life. Yoga education and practices can help such people to develop adequately strong awareness of their 'self'; such practices can also help them to be active and focused, which is a must for the working environment. For elderly people, the emphasis should be on the following parameters or components: Body (physical) awareness. Breath awareness. Awareness about internally aroused sensations related to the movement of in-breath and out- breath through the ear openings, eyes, and olfactory areas. Awareness about gross physical movements related to involuntary and voluntary breathing. Awareness about the flow of memories, thoughts, feelings, and emotions and getting guided by the positive ones to develop a universal state of consciousness. Working with different sounds/chanting ( Mantras ) through recitation. It is essential that elderly people should be warned to protect themselves from the temptation of performing difficult body postures as they may be having osteoporosis and other chronic medico- surgical conditions. They may be susceptible to lose body balance. However, maintaining slow stretching of muscles to extend up to the covering of the bones (periosteum) can help in the treatment of these conditi ons. Using of props and supports will be beneficial for elderly people.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA52 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India BIBLIOGRAPHY Basavaraddi, I.

Patanjali 's Yoga Sutras mention two types of Yoga: (1) Working with the externalising faculties and abilities of the self, enabling the person to work in the external world (Bahya-akasha ). It is termed as Bahiranga Yoga, and (2) Working with the internalising faculties and abilities of the self, enabling the person to work with the 'self' (inside the body) (Antara- akasha ). It is termed as Antaranga Yoga. Groups of practices termed as Yama, Niyama, Asana, and Pranayama constitute Bahiranga Yoga and they are useful for those who want to lead an active and responsible worldly or material life (Bhautika Yoga) involving working with sensory-motor organs ( Jnanendriyas and Karmendriyas ). The practice of Pratyahara introduces a Yoga practitioner to Antaranga Yoga consisting of Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi as one starts working (Chitta), leading to 'Spiritual (Adhyatmika ) Yoga'. All these groups of Yoga practices along with counselling for proper diet, nutrition, exercise, work habits, and social life can be used in therapy. Recitation of suitable Mantras is also useful and effective in its own way. Regular practice may alter the Yoga practitioner's behaviour and dietary habits. All these practices are important for a healthy body and healthy mind. Here, it is important to mention that practices such as Yama (restraints), Niyama (observances), Yukta-ahara (right food), and Yukta- Karma (right actions) are required to be followed by all always in life. These practices are not limited to any space or time. However, there are other Yoga practices like Shatkarma , Asana , Pranayama and Dhyana that are limited in time and space. These practices can be used as per the requirement and capacity of the individual/consumer. There are certain guidelines to be followed by Yoga practitioners to get good results. 5.1 GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS Before Practice Shaucha (cleanliness) must be maintained. It includes cleanliness of body, mind, and surroundings. It means that Yogic practices should be performed with a clean body and mind in a clean and airy place. During Yoga practice, the mind and body should be in a relaxed state. It should not be practiced in exhaustion or in a hurry. Yoga should be practiced in a well-ventilated place, which is free from dust, smoke, bad odour or too much wind. Yoga should be practiced preferably in the early morning before sunrise or within two hours after sunrise. Yoga can be practiced in the evening also, but it has less benefits. Yogic practices should be done on an empty stomach, or keep at least a gap of three to four hours after a full meal and two hours after a light refreshment. The bowel and bladder should be empty before performing Yogic practices. A carpet, folded blanket or a mattress should be used for performing Yogic practices. Loose, light, and comfortable clothes should be worn while practicing Yoga. Cotton clothes are preferable. Spectacles and wrist watches should be removed before doing Yoga. Moderate meals are advised for better results. Oily and spicy food, smoking, and drinking liquor should be avoided. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA56 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India In case of medical conditions such as chronic disease, pain, and cardiac problem, Yoga therapist and/or physician should be consulted before performing Yogic practices. During Practice Yoga session should start with a prayer or invocation to relax the mind and make the environment conducive for performing Yogic practices. Practices should be performed slowly in a relaxed manner with full body-mind awareness. Practices should be performed as per an individual's capacity. Body movements should be smooth. Jerks, force, and/or pressure should always be avoided. Any Yogic practice should be discontinued immediately if there is severe pain in any part of the body. Yoga session should be concluded with meditation/deep silence and end-prayer (Shanti-Path ). After Practice Bath may be taken only about 25-30 minutes after the conclusion of a Yoga session. Food should not be taken immediately after performing Yogic practices. Light food may be taken only after a gap of 15-30 minutes of the Yoga session. 5.2 YAMA AND NIYAMA Yama and Niyama are considered the prerequisites for Yoga Sadhana, which should always be followed by all. Yamas (restraints) can be referred to as the code of conduct to be followed in social life, while Niyamas (observances) can be considered as the code of conduct to be followed in personal life. Together they help in achieving high standards in our personal and social life. Yama consists of the following five restraints: 1. Aparigraha(non-possessiveness or not to possess beyond actual needs). Niyama consists of the following five observances: 1. Shaucha (internal and external purity). 2. Santosha (contentment). 3. Tapas (austerity). 4. Swadhyaya (studying scriptures to acquire right knowledge) . 5. Ishwarpranidhana (surrendering to God). Health benefits from the practice of Yamas and Niyamas Yama and Niyama are helpful for stress management. Stress is generally caused by undisciplined life. Yama and Niyama induce discipline; and thereby help to manage stress and bring happiness in life. Yama can enhance social health by improving interpersonal relationships. Niyama help in improving the mental and spiritual health of an individual. 5.3 ASANA Asanas are psycho-physical postures adopted by the individual to work inside the body. Asana (body position becoming a posture) has to be maintained for some length of time. One is expected to work with one 's breathing during this period (PYS: II.49). CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA57 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India According to Patanjali , it is a comfortable position enabling the person to sit for extended periods. He defines Asana as Sthiram Sukham-Asanam (PYS: II.46). It is one of the eight aspects (Ashta-Anga ) or limbs of Yoga. It is the comfortable position, which facilitates the performance of Pranayama , Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. Hatha Pradipika states that the practice of Asanas brings about steadiness, health, and (a feeling of) lightness of body parts. (Kuryat-Tad-Asanam Sthairyam-Arogyam Changa-Laghavam) (HYP: I. 17). Correct body postures are essential as they control the limbs and nervous system and facilitate meditation. There are various Asanas . Regarding the number of Asanas , there unanimity. Gheranda Samhita puts the number of Asanas as 84 lakhs or 8.4 million. The text considers only 84 as important, and out of these 84 Asanas , it further states that only 32 Asanas as being useful in this world (GS: II/1-2). Hatha Pradipika describes 15 Asanas . Asanas can be classified in several ways. On the basis of utility, Asanas can be classified as meditative Asanas , cultural Asanas , and relaxing Asanas . On the basis of the physical position adopted, Asanas can be broadly put in the following Sequencing of the Asanas during their practice is an important issue. There are various versions regarding the sequence of Asanas. Some schools adopt a natural evolutionary sequence, which occurs in the initial stage of life. As per this approach, a beginner is advised to start with supine-lying Asanas, then to prone-lying Asanas, then sitting and standing Asanas, and finally to, balancing Asanas. Some schools adopt a different approach starting with standing Asanas , then sitting ones, then prone- lying, supine-lying, and balancing Asanas . However, the basic idea is that Asanas should be practiced in a graded sequence, i.e., from easy Asanas to difficult Asanas . Further, a few Asanas from each group can be selected depending on the requirement. It is not necessary that all Asanas from each group are practiced everyday. Salient features of Asanas Asanas are considered as an important aspect of Yoga practice and a pre-requisite for performing other Yoga practices. In Hatha Yoga , Asanas (body postures) are practiced to help open the Nadis (energy cha nnels) and the Chakras (psychic energy centers).CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA58 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India The Asanas have been adopted from the nature by the Yogis based on their observations. Yogis observed that a person, while engaged in various activities, adopts various postures. Animals and birds also have their own postures or ways of sitting. On the basis of their experience, Yogis selected certain postures, which they considered useful for Hatha Yoga Sadhana. These postures were taken not only from animals and birds, but also from the non-living things in nature. As Asanas imitate the postures of birds, animals, objects, and nature, they have been named after them. Asanas are psycho-physical in nature. They involve both body and mind. Asanas develop body and breath awareness as the movement of body parts is synchronised with breathing. Asanas are important for spiritual growth. They act upon body and mind and integrate both. Without this, spiritual growth is not possible. Asanas may be practiced by people of all ages as per their capacity or as advised by Yoga experts. Asana is considered as the first part of Hatha Yoga .Their therapeutic significance has been highlighted in the following verse from Hatha Pradipika: Kuryat-Tad-Asanam Asana alleviates diseases and contributes to good health and efficient body. Difference between Asanas and physical exercises There are distinctions between Asanas and physical exercises. They differ in their objectives, modus operandi, and the benefits they give. Asanas were evolved for spiritual purposes; while the physical exercises are meant for physical fitness. Modus operandi of Asanas is also different from that of physical exercises. Asanas are psycho- physical in nature. They involve both mind and body while physical exercises are basically physical in nature. During the practice of Asanas , breath awareness is essential. In Asana , breath should be synchronised with the movement of specific body parts, which it involves. Another distinction between the two is related to physiology and anatomy. Asanas establish proper rhythm in neuro-muscular tone. They enhance the flexibility of stretched organs of the body without putting extra pressure on the heart, while in physical exercises, the heartbeat increases as a result of extra burden on heart. Generally speaking, physical exercises exhaust the body, which is not the case for Asanas . Asanas benefit the mind and the body; while physical exercises benefit mainly the body. For important Asanas and their benefits, please see Annexure 5. 5.4 PRANAYAMA Pranayama can be referred as the breathing techniques that steady the body and mind. According to Patanjali , Pranayama is the cessation of the movement of inhalation and exhalation (PYS: II.49). Pranayama is made of two words: Prana (subtle life force) and Ayama (expansion and extension through control).In Yogic terminology, Pranayama is a systematic process by which control over Prana is achieved through controlled breathing. Here, it is important to know that breath and Prana are two different but closely interconnected concepts. The existence of Prana, a vital life force, depends upon the breath. Without breath, there will be no Prana. Thus, Pranayama is related to breathing; but it is not a simple breathing exercise, rather it is more than that. Pranayama is highly conducive making the mind one-pointed (Ekagra), which is an essential requirement for inner (Antaranga ) Yoga consisting of higher Yogic practices of Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi. By calming the mind, it leads to spiritual development. Pranayama works at the subtle level of personality. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA59 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaSalient features of Pranayama Pranayama is related to respiration, of two processes: inhalation and exhalation. Respiration assists in the metabolic process in which nutrients are converted into useful energy in a cell. It also ensures a proper supply of oxygen to the brain. Pranayama consists of three phases: (a) Puraka (slow, deep, and prolonged inhalation), (b) Kumbhaka (retention of breath inside or outside), and (c) Rechaka (slow and prolonged exhalation). The ideal ratio of Puraka is mentioned as 1:4:2. Puraka refers to conscious, slow, deep, and prolonged inhalation. It enhances the intake of oxygen. During inhalation one has the feeling and awareness of an internal space getting filled. Kumbhaka : Kumbhaka means pause in breathing. It can be considered as retention of breath. This can be done in two ways: (1) Antar Kumbhaka or retaining the breath inside after inhalation (Puraka); (2) Bahya Kumbhaka or retaining the breath outside after exhalation (Rechaka).In Kumbhaka , one has the feeling and awareness of internal space being in a filled condition during the retention of breath inside or in emptied condition during retention of breath outside. Kumbhaka helps in the process of metabolism; and assists in more efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Through regulated breathing, Kumbhaka ensures a sufficient supply of oxygen to the brain; and thus, enhances the efficiency of the brain. Rechaka: Rechaka is an act of exhalation done very slowly. The ideal duration of Rechaka is supposed to be twice the duration of Puraka. The process of Rechaka starts at the end of Kumbhaka. Conscious, slow, and prolonged exhalation in Rechaka helps in completely pushing the carbon dioxide out of lungs. During the phase of exhalation, one has the feeling and awareness of the internal space getting emptied. Pranayama is not just working with different time ratios for inhalation, exhalation, and breath holding. Through working with the flow of breath inside the body, one starts becoming aware of the visceral functions, thereby giving rise to awareness of the 'self'. Gross body movements experienced during normal and voluntary breathing without getting involved in any kind of worldly actions or activities can lead to activation of memories, feelings, emotions, thoughts, actions, and behaviors. The mechanics of working (modus operandi) of Yogic breathing techniques (Pranayama ) is different from the usually followed breathing exercises. The subtle differences between breathing exercises and Pranayama should be properly understood in order to apply Pranayama in therapy. These points are summarised below. Pranayama requires one's attention to be focused on the flow of breath and the gross body movements related with breathing. This helps one to develop awareness of the mechanics of involuntary and voluntary breathing as well as one's breathing pattern. The breathing pattern requires to be corrected if found disturbed and incorrect, according to Yogic concepts. In initial stages, this is done by developing awareness of the 'flow of in-breath and out-breath' guiding the individual along certain pathways (Nadis), destinations, and various happenings at these destinations. Later on, one is advised to work with other body openings. This practice is slowly modified through regulated, controlled, and monitored phases of breathing: (1) inhalation (Svasa ) leading to awareness of the body space/s getting filled (Puraka ); (2) the space/s remaining in a filled state (Kumbhaka ) during cessation of breathing; and (3) exhalation (Prasvasa ) giving rise to awareness of the space/s getting emptied ( Rechaka ). CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA60 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India During the practice of Pranayama, senses are brought inwards helping the person to look within. Regular practice of Pranayama changes the attitude of the person. It reduces the cravings for worldly pleasures. For important Pranayamas and their benefits, please see Annexure 6. 5.5 PRATYAHARA Pratyhara indicates the withdrawal of one's attention from the object of sensory experience (PYS: 2.54). In Pratyahara, senses related to smell, taste, sight, touch, and hearing are controlled and withdrawn from their objects. This becomes possible while working with one's breath and breathing while practicing Pranayama (PYS: II-53).In normal life, an individual remains connected with the external world due to the inputs recieved by sensory organs from objects outside the body; while in Pratyahara, the person gets cut off from outwardly sensory inputs and becomes introverted. This withdrawal from the outside world calms the mind enabling it to penetrate deeper into the depths of mind. Health benefits Pratyahara helps in managing stress, which is caused by anxiety-inducing perceptions. It helps increase willpower and control over the senses. 5.6 DHARANA, DHYANA, AND SAMADHI 5.6.1 DHARANA Dharana means to one object (PYS: III.1). Usually, Dharana is understood and presented as concentration, which is a motor activity. Dharana is a sensory activity as well where one can remain an observer (Drasta ) or a witness (Sakshi). It indicates the broad-based field of attention focusing on inside the body and/or the mind. One can also work with a chosen thought or object, such as a flame of a lamp, the midpoint of the eyebrows, or the image of a deity. In Dharana, an effortless awareness of a specific aspect or area contributing to self-awareness is maintained for a short time. Here, awareness of the subject is broken from time to time due to outside disturbances or the thoughts coming to the mind. 5.6.2 DHYANA Dhyana (meditation) can be referred as the uninterrupted flow of consciousness (on the subject of Dharana)(PYS: III.2). It is a natural outcome of Dharana where mind starts getting continuous uninterrupted inputs from one source. Usually, in daily routine, one reaches a state of Dhyana (meditation) and remains in that state for some time; but that state is different from the state of Dhyana. The practice of Dhyana helps in self-realization leading to transcendence, which is considered as the essence of Yoga Sadhana (the practice of Yoga). Practice of Dhyana can play an important role in Yoga therapy. It is supposed to be a purifier of the mind and a great tranquilliser. Self-realization taking place during meditation as a result of awareness of one's body, breathing, thoughts, actions or feelings can help the person to modify his/her behaviour and lifestyle in the right direction; and thus can help in reducing the sufferings. 5.6.3 SAMADHI Samadhi can be referred as the state when appearance of the object (of meditation) remains without consciousness of one's self (PYS: III.2) .CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA61 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India Samadhi is the process of shifting to a deeper level of consciousness, where the seer (the one who is seeing), the seen, and the process of seeing merge together. Samadhi is characterised by two components: (1) uninterrupted focus on the object of meditation and (2) no awareness of the process or the self. Patanjali refers to two kinds of Samadhi: Samprajnata Samadhi and Asamprajnata Samadhi. Samprajnata Samadhi is the first step where the practice, the process followed, and its outcome is properly known and understood. In this Samadhi, Samskaras are not destroyed. This is also known as Sabija Samadhi, because the seeds or the Samskaras are there. In this Samadhi, there is support (Alambana ). Asamprajnata Samadhi is the highest state of Samadhi.In this Samadhi, there is no support (Alambana) for the mind. The seeds of all Samskaras are completely destroyed. Here, the resulting state of consciousness cannot be described in a logical and sequential manner. 5.6.4 SAMYAMA The three practices (P .Y.S.: III.4.).The process of Samyama starts with Dharana (concentration) in which one concentrates on the object of meditation. Gradually, the Dharana gets converted into Dhyana (meditation) when awareness about the outside world is lost and one is focused on the object of meditation. Then occurs the state of Samadhi. In this state, the person loses personal consciousness and the object of meditation becomes clearer and clearer. These three when practiced in continuity are called Samyama . In Samyama, the object of meditation may be related to a part of the body, thought, mind, any worldly thing, personal possession, or any other thing. Samyama, according to Patanjali , bestows upon the person various psychic powers (Vibhutis) depending upon the object of meditation. Traditionally, the main objective of Samyama was 'realization of the self' (Atma-sakshatkara) and 'realization of the universal nature of the self' (Brahma sakshatkara); however, it can be used for attaining various psychic powers also. In therapy, the practice of Samyama can develop deeper insights about the body, breathing, thoughts, actions, and feelings and lead the person to adopt a healthy lifestyle. 5.7 SHATKARMA OR SHODHANA KRIYAS Shatkarma refers to a set of six traditional cleansing techniques. Shat means six and Karma means action. Thus, Shatkarma means six actions. These are also called Shodhana kriyas. Shodhana means cleansing and Kriya denotes Shodhana Kriyas refer to six yogic processes/ techniques, which are used for internal cleansing of the body. Shatkarma has the therapeutic importance. Shatkarma works on the internal (visceral) structure of the body about which we are usually not educated in commonly available education programmes. Before starting to work on the physical body, these cleansing processes start working on the mind of the practitioner. In the modern age, Shatkarma assumes greater significance as environmental pollution is posing serious threats to the health of human beings. Faulty lifestyle and improper food habits also develop toxins and impurities in the body tissues. As a result, the human body is becoming prone to functional disorders like asthma, bronchitis, migraine, back-pains, gastro intestinal (GIT) disorders, allergies, and skin diseases. In the above scenario, purification of the body is necessary to keep it healthy. This can be achieved with the help of Shatkarma. Hatha Yogic texts describe the therapeutic benefits of Shatkarma in detail. Now, modern medical sciences are also endorsing the health benefits of Shatkarma . While practising Shatkarma , make sure that the tools used like neti pot, water, rubber thread, cotton cloth & other equipments, are clean and sterile.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA62 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaSalient features of Shatkarma Shatkarmas help in the process of self-realization. According to Hatha Yoga, purification of the body is a basic requirement for self-realization (knowledge about the 'self'). The rationale of the internal cleansing techniques of Hatha Yoga is different from that of the emetics and enemas are given in the modern medical system or in the Indian system of medicine (Ayurveda and Naturopathy). As mentioned earlier, Yogic cleansing processes primarily work on the mind (mental body) and the physical body. Shatkarma should be practiced before Pranayama (H.P . 2/21) . They open various channels to facilitate the flow of breath and Prana during the practice of Pranayama. For important Shatkarmas and their benefits, please see Annexure 4. 5.8 MUDRAS AND BANDHAS 5.8.1 MUDRAS Mudra is a specific body position, which is supposed to channelise the energies generated by Asana and Pranayama into various channels and centers, giving rise to a particular states of mind. Some Mudras are performed with Asana and Pranayama ; while some are performed separately after Asana and Pranayama . There are various types of Mudras Some mudras are body positions (Asanas) , which emphasises on working with breathing (Pranayama); while some are Hasta-Mudras, which are formed with the help of thumb and fingers of the hand (Hasta ). Hasta-Mudras are one of the widely used mudras and are performed in sitting position during the practice of Pranayama, Dharana, Dhyana, and Mantra Japa. The practice of Hasta-mudra is based on the assumption that the physical body is made up of five elements: (1) Fire (Agni), (2) Wind or Air (Vayu ), (3) Ether or Space (Akasha) (4) Earth (Prithvi), and (5) Water (Jala ). These five elements are represented by thumb, index finger, middle finger, ring finger, and little finger, respectively. A balance among these elements is considered important for health. An imbalance among these elements is believed to cause disease; but the imbalance can be corrected by Hasta -Mudras , i.e., combining a particular finger(s) with the thumb. The widely used Hasta-Mudras are (1) Jnana Mudra, (2) Chin are supposed to lock the Prana in a particular area of the body and redirect it along certain Nadis (channels). Traditionally, Bandhas are practiced during the Mudras and are extensively used with Kumbhaka Pranayamas. There are three Bandhas: Moolabandha, Uddiyanabandha, and to apply all three Bandhas (Moola, Uddiyana, and Jalandhara) together during AND YUKTA-KARMA 5.9.1 YUKTA-AHARA Yukta-Ahara is a Yogic concept advocating right food and good food-habits for healthy living. Diet is an important requirement of health. The Bhagawad Gita and Hatha Yoga Pradipika emphasise that one must be careful ab out food.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA63 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaThe concept of Yukta-Ahara is taken from the Bhagawad Gita (17:7-10).The Bhagawad , and Tamasik is naturally grown and is fresh, non-spicy, and easy to digest. It energises the mind. Sattvik food includes milk, milk products, fruits, dried fruits, seasonal vegetables, cereals, sprouts, pulses, honey, jaggery, sugarcane, and natural and unprocessed sugars and oils. According to Bhagawad Gita (17: 8), Sattvik food enhances the duration of life, purifies one's existence, and gives strength, health, happiness, and satisfaction. Rajasik food includes the food that is too bitter, too sour, salty, hot, pungent, dry and burning (Bhagawad Gita : 17: 9). This kind of food is very spicy and is heavy to digest. However, this food is required for physically active people. Tamasik food refers to the food that is stale, tasteless, decomposed, and putrid (Bhagawad Gita : 17: 10). This food is not natural. This type of food is supposed to disturb the balance of nerves. It includes stale, left-over, contaminated or over-ripe substances, meat, alcohol, tobacco, onions, garlic, and fermented foods such as vinegar. Another Yogic concept related to food is Mitahara. Mitahara is defined as agreeable and sweet food, leaving one-fourth of the stomach free, and eaten as an offering to please Lord Shiva or God (HYP: I.58). Mitahara considers three aspects of food: (a)the quality of food, (b) the quantity of food, and (c) the state of mind in which food is eaten. Regarding the quality of food, the food should be nutritious, fresh, non- spicy, and more in natural form. As for quantity, the concept of Mitahara explains that the stomach should never be overloaded; it should be half-filled with food, one-quarter with water, and one-quarter with air. Eating 'to please Lord Shiva' symbolises that food should be taken in with a sense of Dharma (duty) and with a positive state of mind. Here, it is important to mention that food intake depends on the objectives and requirement of the practitioner. The food requirement of a normal person will be different from the food requirements of a diseased person. For therapeutic purposes, the concepts of Pathya and Apathya are important. Pathya is a desirable food, which is beneficial for health. Pathya food varies according to the disease. 5.9.2 YUKTA-KARMA Yukta-Karma is related to right action. The Bhagawad Gita propounds that right actions must be performed with a sense of detachment and duty. One should perform one's duty with full awareness, skill, and intellect but without having any expectations for fruits or results. The actions performed with detachment and dexterity will give satisfaction and protect the person from any kind of stress resulting from non- fulfillment of expectations and bring mental peace. 5.10 MANTRA JAPA Mantra-Japa (recitation of Mantras ) is another important and powerful tool of Yoga therapy. Mantra- Japa is a science in itself, and needs to be properly understood in order to use it in a therapeutic manner. A Mantra refers to sounds, word, or phrase that is repeated by an individual who is praying or meditating. The logic and the modus operandi of Mantra recitation is different from singing, talking, shouting, screaming, etc. The three modes of reciting the Mantra are briefly mentioned below. 1. Loudly (Vaikhari ) recited Mantra: It is used for teaching and learning Mantra correctly and properly. It can be heard by others and it can be easily recited during exhalation. During recitation, one becomes aware of the muscular activity in the lower abdominal muscles and the direction of the internally generated force working in an upward direction inside the body. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA64 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India2. Whispering mode (Upanshu) of reciting Mantra: It is just like 'lip movement'.The Mantra can be recited during exhalation and inhalation. Increased muscular activity can be felt in the neck and the face area. One can easily sense and recognise 'emptying' and 'filling' of the trunk cavity. 3. Mental recitation (Manas Japa ) of the Mantra: There is no visible movement of the lips. It can be recited during exhalation, inhalation, and also during cessation of breathing at any stage. Mental recitation of Mantra is supposed to be powerful than the loud recitation. It works on the mind. Silent recitation of Mantra increases parasympathetic activity.

CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA65 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaCHAPTER 6 PRACTITIONERS, PRICING, AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGECONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA66 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaCONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA67 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India6.1 PRACTITIONERS A Yoga practitioner is a person who practices in the health-care system as a Yoga therapist. A Yoga therapist is one who has received knowledge and training, and has gained experience as a therapist from institutions or centers of higher learning, which are accredited or recognized by an appropriate body. It is preferable if they have some form of license/registration granted by appropriate authorities. To ensure the reliability of a therapy provider, their certification must be recognized and regulated by the statutory bodies. These statutory bodies should ensure the standards of the practices of all the Yoga service providers. The Indian Yoga Association (IYA) has been constituted at the initiative of MDNIY, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Ayush, Government of India. IYA has taken a lead to develop guidelines for certification and execute the same through the Quality Council of India (QCI). The Government of U.K. has formed the British Council for Yoga Therapy (BCYT) where Yoga therapists are expected to get themselves registered with this Council in order to practise Yoga therapy. The European Union (E.U.) is also setting up guidelines in this direction. In U.S.A., only medically qualified people are expected to administer Yoga therapy to the patients. The Association of Yoga therapists in Japan runs courses to prepare Yoga therapists. The Iyengar Yoga Associations worldwide have a very strong system of accreditation of the yoga teachers. Teachers are categorised into 4 levels depending upon the kind of students, the kind of practices and the kind of therapeutic conditions they are permitted to teach. An ideal Yoga teacher, therapist, or a guide should have personal experiences of the results of the Yoga techniques that are going to be taught to the consumers/stake-holders (Sadhakas). The experiences should be on the lines as mentioned in the authoritative traditional Yoga texts. Classical Yoga is based on subjectively experienced parameters. These parameters are monitored and suitably modified to suit the needs of the person; the person may experience desirable changes according to the state of the person till the final aim of Yoga is realized. A Yoga practitioner working as a teacher or, a therapist or a guide should have adequate knowledge and understanding of the theoretical foundations of different schools of Yoga, the rationale behind Yoga practices, and the modus operandi of the different groups of Yoga practices and techniques. In the same way, he/she should have proper and adequate experiential knowledge about the structure and functioning of the human body and psyche and how it gets influenced by various parameters in a positive and negative direction. A Yoga therapist should have a positive attitude and the required skills for rendering service to the suffering person. The mindset and attitude of a Yoga therapist should override his/her professional and the business interests to give or get positive results early. 6.2 PRICING AND HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE 6.2.1 PRICING OF YOGA SERVICES AND MATERIALS Pricing of Yoga services is an important issue. The payment for receiving Yoga services is generally made in the form of tuition fees, honorarium, Guru Dakshina , etc. However, no standard pricing structure is fixed for providing Yoga services. They vary in the same country and in the same region of the country according to (a) the expertise and experience of the Yoga therapist, (b) the affordability of the consumers, and (c) the nature of services rendered. There is a need to evolve an uniform pricing structure by the regulatory bodies keeping some of the following factors in mind.CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA68 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India It should be profitable for the Yoga therapist/instructor and at the same time, it should be affordable to the consumers. There is a need to evolve such regulatory bodies, which can decide on the prices, keeping these points in mind. The material used for therapy such as pamphlets, booklets, charts, DVDs, CDs, mats, blocks, belts, Neti Pots, Dhautis, and Netis could be decided based on their quality. Quality control of the above-mentioned objects could be developed to protect the end-users from harmful effects. There should be a standard system to ensure the quality of the services and also evolve a system that can decide the pricing. 6.2.2 INSURANCE OF SERVICE PROVIDERS AND PRACTITIONERS A few countries (ex. India, Germany, USA) allow Yoga under health insurance. To promote Yoga, there is a need of formulating proper policy, which will adequately protect both Yoga therapists and Yoga consumers. Third-party insurance for individuals or groups of Yoga consumers could be considered to promote Yoga as a therapeutic tool. Insurance for accidents taking place during teaching, learning, and practicing Yoga in Yoga classes, therapy centers, and even during practicing Yoga at home in the absence of Yoga teachers/therapist may be considered for this purpose. Consumers and service providers should get information from the concerned authorities whether Yoga therapy falls under suitable health insurance policy at their respective places. 6.3 CERTIFICATION AND STANDARDIZATION 6.3.1 YOGA CERTIFICATION BOARD (YCB) With the growing popularity of Yoga across the world, the demand for institutionally trained Yoga professionals has increased both globally and internationally. To cater to this increasing demand, Ministry of Ayush, Government of India took a noble initiative to establish a Yoga Certification Board.

The Yoga Certification Board also has representation of various ministries, revered Yoga gurus, accreditation experts, and legal experts for the smooth functioning of the board. The YCB secretariat is headed by the Head of Institute, who is the director of Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga. The aim of Yoga Certification Board is to bring quality and standards in practice of Yoga and promote Yoga as a career. Yoga Certification Board has been established for certification of Yoga professionals under various categories, accreditation of Yoga Institutions/Centers, prescribing syllabus for various levels of Yoga trainers and any such activities that may be deemed necessary for promotion of Yoga. Professional assessment of these service providers are carried out by YCB to certify the competencies so that user of the service is assured of the skill sets possessed by the trainer. The main objective of creating the Board is to promote Yoga as a career skill and to bring standard and uniformity in teaching and practice of Yoga in India and across the Globe with a view to attain holistic health and preserve human values. The board also serves as a platform to amalgamate the practice of different schools of thought and define a standard for Yoga professionals. Structure of the Board: For smooth functioning of the board, four committees have been constituted to advise the board. The co mposition of the YCB secretariat is as follows:CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA69 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of India YCB certifies Yoga Professionals based on their skills and competencies under four categories of proficiency as mentioned below: 1) Yoga Education and Training: Yoga Protocol Instructor (YPI) Yoga Wellness Instructor (YWI) Yoga Teacher and Evaluator (YT&E) Primary/Elementary School Yoga Teacher Higher Secondary School Yoga Teacher Yoga Master (YM) 2) Yoga Therapy Assistant Yoga Therapist (AYTh) Yoga Therapist (YTh) Yoga Therapeutic Consultant (ThYC) 3) Yogasana Coach 4) Yoga Volunteer (YV) YCB accreditation of institutions/centers is done in the following categories as per the prescribed guidelines of YCB.

Meditation is called 'Dhyana ' in Sanskrit, which comes from the root word Dhyati meaning to contemplate or meditate. Meditation is also being used in place of Sanskrit words such as Dharana , Dhyana, Samadhi and Bhavana , which are used to describe various stages of meditation. The word 'meditation' means Dhyana or contemplation. It is not an ordinary or regular form of concentration, rather a distinct and unique one. Meditation is a conscious process or an exercise of the will, it also refers to concentration on spiritual ideas which presuppose that the seeker is capable of rising above worldly ideas. It is also considered as a practice that usually focuses on particular centre of consciousness in the body. Meditation aims to explore the different aspects of the mind and eventually to cultivate greater self-awareness. In the advanced stages of meditation, consciousness moves to the higher levels of consciousness, or to super consciousness. The meditator enters the dimensions of inspiration and illumination. The culmination of meditation is self-realization. CLASSICAL DEFINITION OF MEDITATION Following are the definitions for mediation/ Dhyana in the classical texts of yoga. Meditation keeps the mind focused uninterruptedly on a subject for a certain length of time. It is a mental process by which a meditator becomes one with the object of meditation. According to sage Patanjali , Meditation/ Dhyana, the seventh Tatra pratyayaikatanata dhyanam (Patanjali Yoga Sutra III.2) Uninterrupted flow of the mind towards the object of focus is meditation. Sage Vyasa further explains Dhyana in his commentary is a continuous flow of knowledge which has the object of meditation as its support; i.e. a continuous flow of knowledge untouched by other knowledge system. In the Bhagavad Gita , by little, let him attain quietude by his intellect held firm; having made the mind established in the Self, let him not think of anything. The Svetasvatara Upanishad says, \"The sages saw the Divine Self-power, hidden in its own qualities by the OF YOGA140 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaThose who practiced meditation realized that the cause of creation, the power of God (Devatma- Shakti) is hidden in his own qualities (Gunas ), which alone rules over all these causes beginning with time and ending with the individual soul. Meditation leads to realization. Devatma Shakti; this is the power of God. It is Maya . It's qualities are Sattva (purity, goodness), Rajas (activity, passion), Tamas (darkness, inertia). TYPES OF MEDITATION: Meditation can be practiced for spiritual development and is also used in scientific exploration, especially in the field of therapy. Following are the types of meditation: A. CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) Cyclic Meditation is a moving meditation technique. The concept came from the Mandukya Upanishad. It consists of gentle yogic stretching with mindfulness and slow motions followed by relaxation. According to Sage Patanjali , CM induces a tranquil state of mind, which is comparable with the description of meditation (Dhyana or effortless expansion). Although Cyclic Meditation differs from the traditional definition of meditation in which practitioners remain as motionless as possible, the mental state in both the practices (moving meditation and seated practices) is said to be comparable. Being mindful of bodily sensations is a crucial element of this practice, emphasizing its mindfulness aspect. B. TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION (TM) Transcendental meditation is a form of Mantra meditation, which was introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Transcendental Meditation involves redirecting one's attention from the surface level of ordinary thoughts to increasingly subtle levels until the subtlest level is reached and ultimately transcended. The meditator's attention goes beyond (transcend means \"to go beyond\") the finest level of thought to the source of thought\u2014the pure, undifferentiated consciousness in which all thoughts and perceptions take shape. TM provides a simple and direct means of freeing oneself of tension and developing greater awareness and clarity of thought. CONSUMER INFORMATION ON PROPER USE OF YOGA141 Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga Ministry of Ayush, Government of IndiaC. VIPASSANA MEDITATION Vipassana means \"insight\" in the ancient Pali language. It was discovered by Gautama Buddha about more than 2500 years ago. The term Vipassana refers to a distinct way of observing the reality within oneself, akin to a special kind of vision. It is achieved by taking one's own physical sensations as the object of attention. This technique is a systematic and dispassionate observation of sensations within oneself. Vipassana meditation allows one to observe reality from every angle while dealing with the depths of the mind. D. PREKSHA MEDITATION This is also an ancient technique of meditation practiced in Jainism. Preksha Dhyana is a system of meditation that involves engaging one's mind in the perceptions of subtle, internal and innate phenomena of consciousness, while being impartial to emotions such as pleasure, pain, liking or dislike. Preksha means to perceive and realize the subtlest aspects of one's own self, 'to see the Self'. In Preksha Dhyana, no thought is forcefully stopped. Instead, the art of merely observing the thought process without forming any reaction or attachment is developed. In addition to the above-mentioned types, there are also some other meditations that are commonly practised, which include Heartfulness meditation, Sahaja meditation, Chakra meditation, Mantra meditation, Raja Yoga meditation.
