The E3 ubiquitin ligase, Roquin, is involved in immune regulation; however, its role in immunity to M. tuberculosis is unknown. To address this, we infected mice with a point mutation in Roquin1/Rc3h1 (sanroque). Aerosol-infected sanroque mice showed enhanced control of M. tuberculosis infection associated with delayed bacterial dissemination and upregulated TNF production in the lungs after 2 wk. However, this early control of infection was not maintained, and by 8 wk postinfection sanroque mice demonstrated an increased bacterial burden and dysregulated inflammation in the lungs. As the inflammation in the lungs of the sanroque mice could have been influenced by emerging autoimmune conditions that are characteristic of the mice aging, the function of Roquin was examined in immune cell subsets in the absence of autoimmune complications. M. bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin-primed sanroque T cells transferred into Rag1/ mice provided equivalent protection in the spleen and liver. Interestingly, the transfer of mycobacteria-specific (P25 CD4+ TCR transgenic) wild-type spleen cells into sanroque.Rag1/ mice actually led to enhanced protection with reduced bacterial load, decreased chemokine expression, and reduced inflammation in the lungs compared with transfers into Rag1/ mice expressing intact Roquin. These studies suggest that modulation of Roquin in myeloid cells may reduce both inflammation and bacterial growth during the chronic phase of M. tuberculosis infection. Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic respiratory disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is the leading cause of death from a single pathogen worldwide ( [1](javascript:;)). The host's immune response to the pathogen is a major determinant of outcome following M. tuberculosis infection. Protection against M. tuberculosis involves the generation of mycobacteria-specific T cells and the formation of protective granulomas ( [2](javascript:;), [3](javascript:;)). Protective granulomas are compact structures where infected macrophages are interspersed with lymphocytes that form cuffs around the macrophages or wedges between monocytic cells ( [2](javascript:;), [4](javascript:;)). Although initially effective at containing M. tuberculosis infection, the granulomas can grow and erode into bronchi, leading to cavities and dissemination of infection ( [2](javascript:;), [5](javascript:;)). Understanding how the immune system regulates inflammation and granuloma formation against M. tuberculosis may help the design of more effective therapies to limit the damaging inflammation that is characteristic of TB disease. Roquin is an E3 ligase involved in immune regulation, and is essential for the maintenance of T cell tolerance ( [6](javascript:;), [7](javascript:;)). Roquin deficiency is lethal, demonstrating the essential nature of this ligase in controlling development ( [8](javascript:;), [9](javascript:;)). In sanroque mice, a single point mutation Roquin1/Rc3rh1 leads to ICOS and IFN- upregulation by sanroque T cells ( [6](javascript:;), [7](javascript:;)). As a result of this mutation, these mice accumulate increased numbers of T follicular helper (TFH) cells and develop autoimmune disease ( [6](javascript:;), [7](javascript:;)). Roquin is a RNA-binding protein and has demonstrated roles in regulating expression of ICOS, IFN-, and OX40 among other targets, T cell activation, and TFH cell function ( [6](javascript:;)- [8](javascript:;), [10](javascript:;)). To date, the role of Roquin in regulating immunity to bacterial pathogens has not been examined. Using young sanroque mice, the current study demonstrates that a mutation in Roquin affects both the T cell-mediated immune response and the granulomatous response to M. tuberculosis infection and demonstrates how these factors contribute to the overall control of M. tuberculosis infection. Materials and Methods Mice C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and Rag1-deficient (Rag1/) mice Roquin1/Rc3h1 (sanroque, Roquinsan/san) ( [6](javascript:;)) and sanroque.Rag1/ mice, bred and maintained in the Centenary Institute Animal facility, were used at 6 wk. P25 CD4+ TCR-transgenic (Tg) mice specific for aa 240-254 of M. tuberculosis Ag85B were provided by Prof. K. Takatsu ( [11](javascript:;)) (Nihon University, Tokyo, Japan) and Dr. J. Ernst (New York University, New York, NY). All scientific studies using these mice were approved by the Animal Care and Ethics Committee, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia or the Sydney Local Health District under protocol numbers K75/9-2010/3/5387, K75/3-2007/3/4561, and AEC2013-063. Mycobacteria and infections M. tuberculosis H37Rv bovis Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) were cultured in Laboratories, 70\u00b0C. mice were infected via aerosol with 100 CFU of M. tuberculosis H37Rv using a Middlebrook airborne infection apparatus (Glas-Col, Terre Haute, IN) or i.v. with 104 CFU of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Bacterial growth was quantitated by plating a serial dilution of organ homogenates or bone marrow-derived (BMd) stimulation Culture filtrate protein (CFP) containing excreted and secreted proteins from M. tuberculosis H37Rv ( [12](javascript:;)) was obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infections Research Resources repository. Lung images and involvement Organs were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5 m, and H&E stained by Histopathology, Veterinary Pathology Diagnostic Services, University of Sydney. An image of each entire lung lobe was taken at 10\u00d7 magnification on a Leica DM6000B microscope. The threshold of the image was set in Adobe Photoshop, such that the lung parenchyma appeared in white and areas of inflammation black, and pixilation was recorded at this point as A. The threshold was then changed to blacken the entire lobe and the level of pixilation was recorded as B. The percentage of lung involvement = (A/B) \u00d7 100 ( [13](javascript:;)). Single cell suspensions Lungs were digested in collagenase I and DNase I in RPMI 1640 media at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Lung cells were dispersed through a 70 m nylon sieve, and RBCs lysed with ACK lysis buffer for 30 s. Lymph nodes (LNs) were also processed through a sieve to obtain single cell suspensions. Spleens harvested from P25 TCR-Tg mice were processed through a sieve and RBCs were lysed for 1 min. BMd macrophages were prepared as previously described ( [14](javascript:;)). After 5 d culture, they were stimulated overnight with 100 U IFN- (R&D Systems) then infected with M. bovis BCG. Extracellular bacteria was removed after 4 h, and bacterial viability assessed at 24 h as previously described ( [14](javascript:;)). Cytokine levels were measured by cytometric bead and NO by Greiss reaction. Flow cytometry Mediastinal lymph node (MLN) and lung cells (4 \u00d7 105 - 106 per well) were preincubated with Fc block (2.4G2; BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, before staining with the Abs detailed below in FACS wash at 4\u00b0C for 15 min. Then cells were washed and fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. For intracellular cytokine staining, cells were with CFP (10 g/ml) overnight then treated with Brefeldin A (10 g/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h prior to staining. Cells were stained for surface markers as described above, then fixed and permeabilized for 20 min at room temperature with 100 l per sample of Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences) and washed with Cytowash (BD Biosciences). Anti-cytokine Abs were diluted in Cytowash and incubated with the cells at 4\u00b0C for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with Cytowash and suspended in 10% neutral II or LSR Fortessa flow analyzers (BD Biosciences) were used to acquire the samples and FlowJo analysis software (Tree Star) was used to analyze them. The gating strategies are outlined in [Supplemental Fig. (homogenized lungs were spun at 3200 \u00d7 g for 10 min at room temperature), or IL-1 and TNF from BMd macrophage cultures were measured by CBA (BD Biosciences) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Samples were acquired using the LSR Fortessa or LSR II and analyzed using FCAP software (BD Biosciences). Transfer of M. bovis BCG-primed T cells into Rag1/ mice WT and sanroque mice were immunized s.c. with 5 \u00d7 105 CFU of M. bovis BCG at the base of the tail and in both footpads. Then 21 d post immunization, draining LNs (inguinal, popliteal, and para-aortic) were digested in complete RPMI 5 U/ml collagenase (Boehringer) and 13 g/ml DNase1 (Worthington) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. Single cell suspensions were cultured in media (106 cells per ml) with M. bovis BCG sonicate (10 g/ml) and recombinant IL-2 (2 Systems) for 8 d. M. bovis BCG sonicate was prepared by amplitude (BRANSON Digital Sonifier). On day 8, 2.5 \u00d7 106 cultured cells and 1 \u00d7 104 bacilli of M. tuberculosis H37Rv were injected i.v. into Rag1/ mice. Then 18 d following infection, lungs, liver, and spleen were homogenized and plated on 7H11 agar to assess bacterial growth. Transfer of P25 TCR-Tg spleen cells into Rag1/ mice Purified spleen cells (2 \u00d7 106) harvested from P25 TCR-Tg mice, were injected i.v. into WT.Rag1/ and sanroque.Rag1/ mice challenged with an aerosol infection with M. tuberculosis H37Rv on the following day. Statistical analysis Statistical differences were analyzed in Prism (GraphPad Software), with one-way ANOVA and Tukey multiple comparison test used for comparison of multiple samples, or unpaired Student t test for two samples. The differences with a p value <0.05 were considered significant. Results Increased T cell activation and mycobacteria-specific cytokine production during M. tuberculosis infection in sanroque mice Roquin is involved in immune tolerance; however, its role in immunity to bacterial infections is not clear. Sanroque mice, homozygous for a point mutation in the Roquin1 gene, were infected by aerosol with low-dose M. tuberculosis to examine the effect of Roquin on the immune response against M. tuberculosis. As the sanroque mice progressively develop an autoimmune disease, they were used at 6 wk of age. Previous studies have shown that as a result of their autoimmune conditions, sanroque mice have enlarged LNs and spleens, with increased numbers of activated (CD44HiCD62Low) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and TFH cells from 6 to7 wk of age, which accumulate as they age ( [6](javascript:;)). In this study, the MLNs of sanroque mice, regardless of infection, were larger than the WT mice, with increased numbers of activated CD4+ T cells in the MLNs at all time points (including uninfected sanroque mice) ( [Fig. 1A-D](javascript:;)). WT mice show increased accumulation cells in MLNs as infection progressed ( [Fig. 1A-D](javascript:;)). Similarly, the lungs of WT mice show increased accumulation of activated T cells that peaked at 4 wk and were maintained at 8 wk, whereas sanroque mice continue to show increased recruitment of activated T cells into the lungs up to 8 wk ( [Fig. 1A-D](javascript:;)). The numbers of TFH cells similar pattern of recruitment ( [Fig. 1E-H](javascript:;)), with sanroque mice showing increased accumulation of TFH cells into the lung at 8 wk postinfection. [Close modal](javascript:;) To examine Early in infection, TNF-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were evident in the lungs and MLNs of both WT and sanroque mice, although the percentage of these cells was significantly higher in sanroque mice ( [Fig. 2A](javascript:;), [2B](javascript:;)). At 4 wk, which was the peak of the bacterial load in the WT mice ( [Fig. 3](javascript:;)), these mice showed a significantly higher percentage of IFN--producing CD4+ T cells in the lungs, compared with the sanroque mice ( [Fig. 2C](javascript:;), [2D](javascript:;)). The sanroque mice significantly higher percentages of TNF-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, but only in the MLNs. By 8 wk, when sanroque mice show increased bacterial burden in the lung, which was accompanied by an increase in the percentage of IFN--producing T cells in the MLNs and lungs compared with WT-infected mice ( [Fig. 2E](javascript:;), [2F](javascript:;)), which may have by the rising antigenic load ( [Fig. 3](javascript:;)). The percentage of IL-17+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was low in both strains of mice throughout the infection, although by 8 wk there was a significantly higher percentage of CD8+ IL-17-producing T cells in the MLNs of WT mice. [Close modal](javascript:;) [Close modal](javascript:;) Sanroque mice control early but not late M. tuberculosis infection Two weeks following aerosol infection, sanroque mice showed delayed bacterial dissemination into the spleen compared with WT littermates ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). From four experiments, 14 out of 15 sanroque mice had no detectable bacteria in the spleen, whereas 11 out of 16 WT mice showed dissemination to the spleen by this time ( [Supplemental Fig. 1](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109642/pdf/ji_1602069_supplemental_figures_1/)). The increase in activated T cells 1](javascript:;)) and the enhanced TNF response ( [Fig. 2](javascript:;)) was associated with a significant delay in dissemination consistent with the control of bacterial growth. However, by 4 wk postinfection both groups of mice showed equivalent bacterial loads ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)), and as the infection progressed to a chronic stage, sanroque mice demonstrated a reduced ability to control infection in the lung ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). Interestingly, bacterial growth in the spleen remained significantly lower in the sanroque mice ( [Fig. 3A](javascript:;)). Furthermore, this increase in bacterial growth in the lung was associated with dysregulated inflammation ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). Sanroque mice developed larger lesions with granulomas that lacked the organized structure seen in WT mice ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). WT cuffing the macrophages, whereas those in sanroque mice contained large lesions, composed predominantly of macrophages with less dense infiltration of lymphocytes ( [Fig. 3B](javascript:;)). These lymphocytic cuffs are likely both T and B lymphocytes ( [16](javascript:;), [17](javascript:;)). Interestingly at 8 wk postinfection, WT but not sanroque mice showed increased recruitment of B cells into the lungs ( [Supplemental Fig. 2E](/jimmunol/article-supplement/109642/pdf/ji_1602069_supplemental_figures_1/)). These findings demonstrate an important role for Roquin in regulating the inflammatory response to M. tuberculosis infection. To examine how Roquin functions at the cellular level, we examined the role of Roquin in different immune cell subsets. Transfer of Ag-specific sanroque T cells protects against M. tuberculosis infection with reduced inflammation At 8 wk post M. tuberculosis infection, sanroque mice showed increased bacterial growth in the lung with dysregulated granuloma formation. To examine whether a defect in the activation of Ag-specific T cells was responsible for this, we measured the protective efficacy of sanroque T cells independent of other Roquin mutated cells. M. bovis BCG-primed sanroque T cells were transferred into Rag1/ recipient mice that were then infected systemically with M. tuberculosis. In this model, mice were infected i.v. to provide sufficient Ag to stimulate the transferred T cells ( [18](javascript:;)). The transfer of T cells from either WT or sanroque M. bovis BCG-immunized mice reduced the growth of M. tuberculosis in the spleen, liver, and lungs compared with Rag1/ mice receiving T cells from unimmunized mice ( [Fig. 4A-C](javascript:;)). In the spleen and liver, the transfer of T cells from unimmunized mice, either WT or sanroque, was sufficient to reduce M. tuberculosis growth compared with Rag1/ mice alone, although in the lungs, only the transfer of T cells from immunized WT mice provided significant protection compared with infected Rag1/ mice. The transfer of T cells from immunized sanroque mice reduced bacterial growth; however, this did not reach significance by ANOVA. What was striking about the response of mice receiving T cells from immunized sanroque mice was the significant reduction in inflammation in the lungs compared with the Rag1/ mice receiving T cells from immunized WT mice ( [Fig. 4D](javascript:;)), despite the fact that they had higher bacterial loads ( [Fig. 4C](javascript:;)). These lesions were macrophage dominant with the lymphocytes localized around the perivascular region. This differed from the response seen in M. tuberculosis-infected WT mice described in [Fig. 3B](javascript:;), which showed granulomas with lymphocyte aggregates surrounding the monocytes/macrophages. Interestingly the Rag1/ receiving T cells from unimmunized sanroque mice also displayed a trend toward reduced lung inflammatory involvement, although this did not reach significance. This study demonstrates that mycobacteria-specific T cells generated in the absence of normal Roquin can stimulate the control of mycobacterial infection. [Close modal](javascript:;) Transfer of mycobacteria-specific T cells enhances control of M. tuberculosis infection in sanroque.Rag1/ mice The dysregulated inflammatory response seen in the lungs of sanroque mice during chronic M. tuberculosis infection may have been influenced by the development of autoimmune conditions common in sanroque mice ( [6](javascript:;), [7](javascript:;)). To examine the functions of the Roquin mutation in myeloid cells in the absence of this autoimmune complication, sanroque.Rag1/ mice were used ( transferred into sanroque.Rag1/ or Rag1/ controls, then infected with a low-dose aerosol of M. tuberculosis to mimic the natural route of infection. Interestingly, at 8 wk postinfection the transfer of P25 spleen cells into sanroque.Rag1/ mice enhanced control of bacterial growth in the lung compared with Rag1/ control mice receiving the same number of P25 spleen cells ( [Fig. 5A-B](javascript:;)), although similar numbers of activated T cells were recovered from the lungs of both groups of mice ( [Fig. 5D-E](javascript:;)). [Close modal](javascript:;) This reduced bacterial load was associated with significantly reduced inflammation in the lungs of these sanroque.Rag1/ mice ( [Fig. 6A](javascript:;)). Therefore, we examined if the Roquin mutation influenced the recruitment of myeloid cells into the lungs of the infected Rag1/ mice ( [Fig. 6](javascript:;)). At 2 wk postinfection, and sanroque.Rag1/ mice had similar numbers of CD45.2+ cells in the lungs; by 8 wk there was a trend toward increased recruitment of CD45.2+ cells to the lungs of WT.Rag1/ mice but this did not reach significance ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). Equivalent numbers of neutrophils (CD11bHiLy6GHi) were seen time points ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). At 2 wk WT (CD11bHiCD11cHi), however, by 8 wk the numbers of monocytes/macrophages were significantly reduced in the sanroque.Rag1/ mice ( [Fig. 6B](javascript:;)). This reduction was associated with significantly lower levels of the leukocyte-recruiting chemokines MIP-1 and RANTES in the lungs ( [Fig. 7](javascript:;)). When we examined the cytokine response of the resident CD45.2+ Rag1/ myeloid cells, the WT.Rag1/ mice cells initially showed increased percentages of TNF-producing CD11bLow-Mid and CD11bHi cells compared with the sanroque.Rag1/ mice that received P25 spleen cells, whereas by 8 wk, these sanroque.Rag1/ showed a higher percentage identify complex multiple roles of Roquin in regulating immune cell function during M. tuberculosis infection and reveal that it is possible to both enhance control of mycobacterial growth and to limit the lung-damaging pathology often associated with M. tuberculosis infection. Discussion The E3 ubiquitin ligase, Roquin, is involved in immune regulation, influencing both T cell and myeloid cell functions ( [6](javascript:;)). These studies demonstrate that Roquin plays a role in regulating the inflammatory response against M. tuberculosis, aiding in the formation of protective granulomas and, importantly, maintaining control of chronic infection. Results with the sanroque.Rag1/ mice suggest that the function of Roquin differs depending upon the immune cell examined and that normal Roquin in myeloid cells actually contributes to the increased inflammatory cell influx and damaging pathology associated with TB disease. In TB patients, upregulated ICOS expression has been correlated with induction of protective Th1 responses, and with increased IFN- release from T cells ( [20](javascript:;)). Sanroque mice have increased numbers of activated T cells with enhanced ICOS, TNF, and IFN- expression ( [6](javascript:;)), which was associated with early containment of the TB infection at 2 wk. At 4 wk, the frequencies of IFN--, TNF-, and IL-17-producing T cells were similar in both strains of mice as were the bacterial loads. By 8 wk, contrary to expectations, despite the increase in T cell activation, ICOS expression and mycobacteria-specific IFN-+ T cells did not equate with enhanced protection in the Sanroque mice. Repeated studies have demonstrated that although IFN- is essential for protective immunity against M. tuberculosis ( [21](javascript:;), [22](javascript:;)), increased IFN- production does not necessarily correlate with increased protection ( [23](javascript:;)- [25](javascript:;)). Indeed, the increase in bacterial load in the lungs of the Sanroque mice at this time may have driven the increase in IFN-- and TNF-producing T cells. Identifying appropriate correlates of protection would greatly assist in assessing the effects of new vaccines or drug treatments. The Roquin mutation also gives rise to TFH cell accumulation ( [6](javascript:;)). The influence of TFH cells on immunity to M. tuberculosis infection is not well understood. Uninfected sanroque mice had increased numbers of TFH cells in the lung compared with WT mice, and this was further enhanced by M. tuberculosis infection. TFH cells express CXCR5, and Slight et al. ( [26](javascript:;)) demonstrated a role for CXCR5+ CD4+ T cells in orchestrating the spatial arrangement of T cells in M. tuberculosis-induced granulomas. M. tuberculosis-infected Cxcr5/ mice lacked the ectopic lymphoid structures present in WT mice, suggesting that CXCR5+ T cells, which include TFH cells, are involved in the formation of lymphoid follicles in the lung during TB infection ( [26](javascript:;)). Our data demonstrate that increased numbers of TFH cells, as seen in our sanroque mice, did not enhance protective granuloma formation in the lungs during M. tuberculosis infection. Protective granuloma formation is essential to maintain immunity to M. tuberculosis ( [27](javascript:;)). A feature of protective granulomas includes formation of dense aggregates of lymphocytes, also referred to as lymphocytic cuffing ( [3](javascript:;)). Sanroque lacked the lymphocytic the centralized infected mononuclear cells evident in WT mice. One explanation for the failure to contain infection is that the impaired localization of lymphocytes, including M. tuberculosis-specific T cells, may have limited the interactions with infected macrophages that are necessary to contain bacterial growth. The lack of lymphocyte aggregation may also be influenced by the reduced accumulation of B cells in the lungs of the sanroque mice. Studies using B cell knockout mice indicate that B cells play a role in forming and maintaining the dense lymphocytic aggregates usually evident in M. tuberculosis-induced granulomas ( [16](javascript:;), [17](javascript:;), [28](javascript:;)). Maintaining the structural integrity of granulomas is essential to control M. tuberculosis growth. Mice with defects in the formation of granulomas, such as Tnf/ mice, are extremely susceptible to infection despite mounting strong Ag-specific immune responses ( [29](javascript:;)). TNF is essential for normal granuloma formation. The Roquin mutation has been associated with enhanced TNF secretion ( [19](javascript:;), [30](javascript:;)). Knock down of Roquin using small interfering RNA in the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 prevented decay of tnf study ( that sanroque.Rag1/ mice were more susceptible to serum-induced experimental arthritis, which was diminished in sanroque.Rag1/ \u00d7 TNF/ mice ( [19](javascript:;)), suggesting that the Roquin mutation in myeloid cells increased TNF expression. Both excessive and inhibited TNF production in murine infectious models can result in uncontrolled inflammation ( [29](javascript:;), [31](javascript:;), [32](javascript:;)). In this study, the effect of the Roquin mutation on TNF production was influenced both by the mycobacterial infection and the cell type involved. Sanroque mice had increased percentages of TNF-producing T cells, particularly early in infection. Although in sanroque.Rag1/ mice following transfer of P25 splenic cells, the level of TNF-producing CD11b+ cells actually decreased early in infection compared with WT.Rag1/ mice without compromising control of infection. Similarly, BMd macrophages from sanroque mice controlled bacterial growth but interestingly produced less TNF than WT infected macrophages, suggesting that it is possible to reduce the inflammatory response induced by M. tuberculosis infection without compromising containment of mycobacterial infection. One difficulty with studying sanroque mice is their propensity to develop the autoimmune disease systemic lupus erythematosus, which is accompanied by glomerulonephritis in mice as well as humans ( [6](javascript:;), [33](javascript:;)). Renal failure impairs cellular immune responses and increases susceptibility to infection ( [34](javascript:;), [35](javascript:;)), and the incidence of TB is higher in patients with chronic renal disease in TB-endemic countries ( [34](javascript:;), [35](javascript:;)). The development of autoimmune renal disease in aging sanroque mice may have rendered these mice more susceptible to chronic M. tuberculosis infection. To compensate for this, we examined the role of Roquin in specific immune cell subsets. Transferring T cells from M. bovis BCG-immunized and unimmunized mice into Rag1/ mice demonstrated that the presence of the Roquin mutation did not impair the generation of mycobacteria-specific T cells or their ability to reduce mycobacterial growth compared with the transfer of naive T cells. Most interestingly, the transfer of mycobacteria-specific spleen cells (WT Roquin) into sanroque.Rag1/ mice actually resulted in increased protection against M. tuberculosis infection with significantly lower bacterial loads at 8 wk compared with similarly treated Rag1/ control mice, reduced chemokines and reduced numbers of macrophages in the lungs, and markedly reduced inflammatory involvement and immunopathology. The reduced chemokines found in sanroque.Rag1/ mice may be a consequence of the reduced antigenic load leading to the stimulation of fewer cells, or alternatively the reduced chemokine expression may have led to lower cellular infiltrate. Importantly, during M. tuberculosis infection myeloid cells in sanroque.Rag1/ mice induced sufficient inflammatory responses to recruit the necessary cells into the lungs and contain infection. In TB infection, protecting against the pathogen but limiting the immune-mediated pathology is essential ( [31](javascript:;)). Several studies have demonstrated that enhanced protection against mycobacterial infection is often associated with limited lung pathology ( [31](javascript:;), [36](javascript:;)) as is the case in the sanroque.Rag1/ mice in this study. Roquin regulates the function of key immune cells including T cells, B cells, and myeloid cells ( [37](javascript:;)). Roquin may exert its effects either as an RNA-binding protein or through its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity ( [38](javascript:;)); both of these mechanisms may contribute to protective immunity. The binding of Roquin to its target mRNA is known to facilitate the degradation of transcripts from multiple immune genes including of which have critical roles in regulating host immunity to M. tuberculosis. The E3 ligase activity of Roquin has not been well described ( [38](javascript:;)), but other E3 ligases have been shown to be important in protection against mycobacterial infections. Genetic variations in the E3 ligase genes, PARK2 and UBE3A, are associated with increased susceptibility to the mycobacterial infections, leprosy, and TB respectively, in humans ( [39](javascript:;)- [41](javascript:;)). The PARK2 gene encodes the protein Parkin, and a recent study demonstrated that Parkin targets M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes, resulting in increased autophagy-mediated killing of M. tuberculosis within macrophages ( [40](javascript:;)). Similar to Parkin, Roquin may also be involved in autophagy. Further study of the mutated Roquin in myeloid cells may provide new insights into increasing mycobacteriocidal capacity of myeloid cells to limit the lung pathology associated with M. tuberculosis infection. In summary, this study has demonstrated the complex roles Roquin plays in the control of M. tuberculosis infection, depending upon the stage of infection and cell type involved. Importantly, they demonstrate roles for Roquin in enhancing mycobacterial growth and the lung-damaging pathology often associated with M. tuberculosis infection.
