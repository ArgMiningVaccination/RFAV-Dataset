Prior to his death, he had initiated a replication of his famous studies on Delinquency in a Birth Cohort done in the US (Wolfgang, Figlio and Sellin, 1972; Tracy, Wolfgang, Figlio, 1990) in China. His work with the Chinese Society of Juvenile Delinquency Research (CSJDR) to study persons living in the city of Wuhan in Central China and born in 1973 was never completed. The Wuhan Project was initiated as a cooperative collaboration between CSJDR together with the International Exchange Association of the Ministry of Education, The Public Security Institute of the Ministry of Public Security, The Public Security Department of Hubei Province and the Public Security Bureau of Wuhan City, and the Sellin Center for Studies in Criminology and Criminal Law, Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. The project was under the leadership of Professor Guo Xiang with Prof. Zhang Liquin, Prof. Dai Yisheng, Prof. Zhang Panshi, and Prof. Xu Qiancheng. Data were collected in Wuhan under the direction of Prof. Xu Qiancheng. The study 0 began in 1990 with a small amount of funding from Marvin Wolfgang, but it was never completed except for a few hand-tallied calculations on the percentage of juveniles with criminal records. This was the information in the NIJ Research Preview based on Wolfgang's presentation (NIJ, 1996). In 1996, at a conference in Dalian, China, the leadership of the CSJDR expressed interest in completing the data collection process and subsequent analysis of the Wuhan ,. Cohort and in 1998, after Wolfgang's death, decided to locate the original instruments And invited Professors Friday and Ren to assist and consult on the project. Professor 0 3 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Weitekamp, who had done a re-analysis of the Philadelphia cohorts, was invited to complete the American Team. Subsequently, Professors Kerner and Taylor joined the e team bringing their history afid knowledge of longitudinal studies and their methodological and statistical skills. Project Description This project was originally designed to work collaboratively with the Chinese scholars to facilitate the completion and analysis of the birth cohort study started in Wuhan in 1990. It was a project designed to locate and determine what data had been collected, what data needed to be collected to complete the study, to gather the necessary data to draw conclusions regarding the accuracy of the original report of a delinquency rate of less than two percent, and to analyze the entire cohort data-set. The project was considered important since it would be the first contribution from a non-western society to the international literature on longitudinal and cohort research. Birth cohort studies, a form of longitudinal research, offer unique data to better theoretically understand the factors associated with initial and continued involvement in crime and delinquency (Farrington, 1992a). Longitudinal research is a source of support for ,an integrated theoretical perspective in the fields of juvenile delinquency and criminology. This type of research strategy, with its emphasis on sequences of events in the life history of individuals born in the same year, provides more rigorous inferences about causation, and therefore prevention, than any other method in criminological science. Longitudinal research can provide information about cumulative phenomena, such as the cumulativ< prevalence of offending up to a certain age or the percentage of fotal crimes committed by \"chronic offenders' (Wolfgang, Figlio, & Sellin, 1972). 4 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Longitudinal research offers the opportunity to view the life history of the same individual over time and to study both changes within individuals and variations between e individuals (Farrington, 1988). There has been a long history of longitudinal studies both before and after the first Philadelphia study. The earliest work in the United States was by the Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck (1 930, 1937, 1943, 1968) and the McCords (1 959). A number of studies Farrington and Elliott and Elliott and Huizinga, 1984; Polk et al. 1981; Shannon, 1988). The methodology and value of longitudinal research, and especially the value of the criminal career paradigm, have been mainly critiqued by Michael Gottfredson and e Travis Hirschi (1986,1988,1990) who argue that the effect of age on crime is invariant. They argued that cross-cultural and historical research shows the age crime-curve in the past 150 years has almost been remained stable. Crime peaks at the age 16 or 17 and declines steadily thereafter. Gottfredson and Hirschi think that a maturational reform best explains this. Desistance of criminal behavior is \"change in behavior that cannot be explained and change that occurs regardless of what else happens\" (Gottfi-edson and Hirschi 1990: 136). In their general theory of crime they argue that delinquent and criminal behavior is a result of low self-control, which is according to them a relatively stable yrqennsiiy that varies from indixiidual to individual and explains differences in criminal behavior. Self-control is to a large degree a result of the child-rearing process and may or may not be inculcated early in the socialization process. Therefore, it is a 5 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.necessary to examine early childhood experiences and individual self-control in order to e understand the causes of crime. In contrast Alfi-ed Blumstein, Jaqueline Cohen and David Farrington ai-gue in favor of the criminal career paradigm since careers can be measured in terms of the \"loiigitudinal sequence of offenses committed by the offender who has a detectable rate of offending during some period (Blumstein et.al. 1988: 2). They argue that longitudinal research is the most significant way to study criminal careers in terms of the key elements longitudinal research and Farrington (2002) argues convincingly that the recently introduced developmental and life-course crirriinology is a further elaboration of the criminal career paradigm and is concerned with three main issues: the development of offending and antisocial behavior, risk factors at different points in time, and the effects of life events on the course of development. 0 Cohort and longitudinal studies have been conducted in a range of other countries including England, Wales and Scotland (Fergusson, 1952; Willuns, 1960; West, 1969; Farrington and West, and Krause, 1983; Kerner et al., 1997). Worldwide, findings from the original cohort studies in Philadelphia and elszwkre significantly affected the academic understanding of crime. The concept of ii:e \"chronic offender\" has become part of the criminological lexicon since studies have qonsistently shown that a small proportion of the population perpetrates a 0 6 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.disproportionate amount of crime. Chronic offenders were first defined by Wolfgang as a person who had, at hisher 1 Sth birthday, accumulated five or more police arrests and who e resided between their loth and lSth year of life in the city of Philadelphia (Wolfgang et al., 1972). However, the term was redefined as one having committed three or more offenses in the cohort research done in Puerto Rico (Nevares et. al. 1990). That there exist problems with the concept of the chronic offender was revealed by the reanalysis of the Philadelphia birth cohorts by Weitekamp et al.( 1995, 1996) and that criminal policies The concept of the chronic offender implies that one who commits a high number of crimes has to be considered a more serious criminal than one who has committed a lesser number of crimes. In addition the implication is that the chronic offender concept e an escalation in effect, meaning that as the number of offenses rises so, too, does the level of seriousness of the crimes committed. The discovery of the chronic offender in the Philadelphia 1945 birth cohort, which Newsweek in March of 1981 referred to as the \"perhaps most influential piece of criminal justice research in the last decade\", happened at a time when rehabilitation seemed to fail (\"Nothing Works\"). Soon afterwards Peter Greenwood (1 982) announced that if one incapacitated those chronic offenders - selective incapacitation - one could drastically reduce the number of crimes being committed. However, there is one problem: one could identify the chronic offender retrospectively but not prospectively. A criminal policy 5aed oii the chronic offender and the selective incapacitation concept, and a call for getting tough on crime, had to fail qince it created a new criminal policy which turned away from social conditions a 7 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.amendable to crime and concentrated itself on \"bad\" individuals. bin (1 985:5) described this the following way: \"As societies pass through uncertain times, they often create myths of the bogeyman and persecute certain categories of persons whom they define as bogeymen. They do not call them that, but the concept fits because these are persons who are believed to be basically different than normal people and permanently evil.\" The resultant get-tough criminal policy in the United States was to ultimately send thousands of supposedly dangerous people into the prisons. But the career criminal concept was of the most serious crimes were actually committed as a first, second, thrd or fourth offenses, at a time when the perpetrators were not considered chronic offenders (Weitekamp et.al. 1996). Longitudinal research has also introduced the important concept of \"criminal careers\" or the lifespan in which offenders are active. Of special interest are those who become known to the police for criminal activity after they reach adulthood and who had never had a police record as juveniles. Longitudinal research offers the opportunity to compare the social and demographic characteristics of the offenders and to consider the social and political changes during adolescence and post-adolescence. The significant number of longitudinal studies conducted thus far and the different countries represented offer an important opportunity for comparison. However, no longitudinal or cohort research has previously been conducted in a developing country except the one by Nevares et al. (1990) 5-1 Puc,eo 3iiico.

This research is seen to add to the body of @owledge previously generated by utilizing similar methodology in a very different 8 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.social, political and economic setting. In so doing, the research falls within the general rubric of \"Comparative Criminology\". e Comparative Criminology attempts to go beyond the conclusions that can be drawn from a given indigenous study in order to determine the extent to which the findings in one setting are applicable to the findings from another setting. To take a comparative perspective, the larger question is why do some societies exhibit patterns of crime different from other societies? This perspective was introduced in a major volume published by the English scholar Hermann Mannheim in 1965. This work and those published around the same time served as a stimulus to scholars, who in the late 1960s and early 1970s looked to Europe and elsewhere to assess the applicability of American based theories (Clifford, 1964, 1976, Clinard and Abbott, 1973, DeFleur, 1969, Downes, 1966, Friday, 1972, Rosenquist and Megargee, 1969, Rad, 1967). It was rare to give any attention outside of the western world. However, there was a growing realization that much of the existing criminological knowledge at the time was skewed and theory was limited in its scope and explanatory power (Beirne and Hill, 1991; Clinard and Abbott, 1973). Scholars became increasingly aware that the definition, character and incidence of delinquency and crime were relative to the cultural, social, small-group, and personality factors, which produced and shaped them. The explanatory power of theories and their extensions into policy can be enhanced considerably if the phenomenon of crime is systematically studied under diverse temporal and cultural conditions. Comparative research can take on four distinct modalities, depending on how the concept of country is used. Countries car! be used as 1) the object of study; 2) the context of study; 3) the unit of analysis; or 4) components of 9 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

For our purposes, and consistent with other comparative criminological research, China will be used contextually, i.e. how does crime and delinquency manifest itself in this non-western culture and Communist economic system? In answering this question, the ultimate objective to advance theory may be furthered (Oyen, 1990; Scheuch, 1990). China offers an extremely unique setting for cohort analysis, especially since one- fifth of the world's population lives there. But China offers more than mere size and changes. According to Anderson and Gil (1998), China has experienced massive migrations, smaller families, liberalization and decentralization of state power and a globalization of tastes and lifestyles. China's overall crime rates, based on official statistics, jumped from 56/100,000 in 1978 to 2001 100,000 in 1991 with the rate from 1988-1991 having quadrupled (Yu, L., 1993). It has been recently argued that this figure should be 800/100,000 based on crime victim surveys and the inclusion of public security e or public safety violations as well as violations of the criminal law (Yu, O., 1999:256). Nonetheless, the figure is significantly lower than most Western rates. Germany, for example had a rate of 7,625/100,000 for all crimes in 2000 (Bundeskriminalamt, 2000) while in the United States the rate for index crimes only was 4,266.8/100,000 in 1999 (Maguire and Pastore, 2000:279). Serious crimes in China appear to accounit for 30% to 40% (Dai, 1997). The total increae in the 1980s was 160 percent with the most predominant increases in the cities, which accounted for 47.5 percent of the nation's total in 1990. The regions with the greatest increase were those with thriving market economies, a greater concentration of a 10 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Transient crimes, crimes of drug trafficking, commercial fraud and counterfeiting have increased (Yuan, 1992). Experience with National Crime Victim Surveys around the world suggests that reported crime is always lower than the amount of crime experienced by the population (Alvazzi del Frate, 1998; Van Kesteren et al. 2000). There is no reason to believe that circumstances are different in China. The official rate, based on reported crimes, will be lower than the experienced rate. This suggests that while the Chinese rate ofcrime is low the skzgc md prcbatvly- even higher involvement in crime than what is reported. China has traditionally had a low rate of crime but current conditions are challenging that. What is also being challenged is the extent to which China's crime rate will be as susceptible to changes in development as has been seen in the former Soviet Union or whether there are indigenous factors which serve to mitigate development's negative impact (Friday, 1998). Discovering the development of criminal careers or the circumstances that increase the probability of offending under such conditions can have a far-reaching implications for crime prevention and control. China is at an important crossroads relatiive to its development and the potential for increasing crime. What happens there is of tremendous theoretical and practical importance. The country is cognizant of this and has initiated programs and policies to address the negative consequences traditionally associated with major economic change. 'The efforts qpear to focus on the reinforcement of traditional and cdt:ud values, noms and informal control mechanisms. It is especially important to follow this cohort to see if guch social policies and the emphasis on informal control and re-socialization of deviants a 11 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This interaction process creates both the crime and generates the seeds for its own prevention. In Western perspectives, social instltutims such 3s +!E ?zx-~i% d ;chool play inqmrtm; ruler; aid these roles must be reinforced. According to Ren (1997), the Confucian assertion dominant in China is that the will of the individual is not free but confined by his obZigatzons to his family, clan, and society as a whole. While this is consistent with the Western image of China, the Chinese linkage of individual to family and group actually goes one-step farther: \"To conform to law was not totally a self-motivated decision for one's personal benefit but was of an altruistic decision for the family's well-being (Ren, 1997:27).\" When a crime was committed, \". . . the individual and the social institution to which he belongs are equally culpable of the wrongdoing\" (Ren, 1997:21). It is the philosophy of this more intense reciprocal respoinsibility that holds the key to successful Chinese prevention programs. Such programs follow the Confucian principles of collective/group responsibility. There is, in China, an important interaction between the individual and the group that lies at the heart of primary prevention. Such a connection is conducive to the early recognition of high-risk ywth a12 the reaoiulion of conflict in an informal context. Completing this Chinese Cohort Study is an effort to gain greater insight into this. Furthermore, it would be also interesting to discover to what extent a 12 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We made a variety of decisions in the course of this research in order to best preserve the ~ integrity of the original research and to then prepare and complete a complimentary study. In short, this report consists of two different data sets. The original list of those born in 1973 as used by Wolfgang could never be located and, as we later discovered, no data were recorded for all 5,341 persons who were in the cohort. Instead, the researches when through all 5,341 records but recorded information only on those identified as offenders (N=81) and matched this group on basic demographic variables with eighty- one from the cohort who had no criminal history This we call the \"Small Data Set.\" The e original 5,341 individuals constitute Cohortl. We later extracted from the civil files an independent cohort of persons born in 1973. Mile there may obviously be some overlap between the 5,341 Wolfgang's Team identified and the 5,384 we located, our cohort (Cohort2) is distinct. Thus, this report has two major sections. The first section is our analysis of the information gathered on the small data set of 162 persons. Included are data from an extensive interview questionnaire. The second section is our analysis of Cohort2, which 13 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.includes all information on criminal activity from age 13 to 27 for those in the Wuhan register as having been born in 1973. 0 Scope and Methodology Original Location, Sample, and Method The research site, the city of Wuhan, and the birth cohort were selected by the Chinese Team and Wolfgang. Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei province and one of the rirost irrqortant industrial cities in ccnt~al Cf=nr: along the Yzngtze Rke zn5 Ezj~kg River. It is an urban, heavy industrial city wilh three distinct districts geographically divided by the two rivers. Hanyang, Hankou, and Wuchang, on the south of Yangtze River bank, were formed as a commercial center in central China about 1,000 years ago. The cohort consisted of all persons in the Wuchange District of the city of Wuhan who were born in 1973. Wuchang is the most populous, major commercial and residential area of Wuhan. Wuchang has been the capital of Hubei Provincial Government since the Qing Dynasty. Thirty-four universities and colleges are also located in this district. Thus, Wuchang is the area seen most likely to experience the impact of the economic change in China. The district was also selected as the site because of the personal contacts of the Chinese Team with the authorities and access to all data and information were assured. The date of the cohort birth is also significant because the sample population was born in kc: first year after China's major ne;^ open policy and the persons in the sample will be the first to experience the impact of major economic and social change. Since the district also has a somewhat higher economic and educational level than the other areas 0 \\ 14 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.of Wuhan, the rate of and changes in criminal activity can be seen across a broader spectrum of the general population. a From notes of the original data collection, the population of Wuhan was 6,532,563 in 1,736,160 households in 1989, the most recent census of the time. Within the urban centers, there were 3,706,693 persons of whom, 26,976 were born in 1973. The decision was made to restrict the data collection to the Wuchong District with 722,599 individuals in 204,254 households within twelve neighborhoods in 1990 (Guo et al., 2002). The original sample identifiea >,33l-]persons who were born in 13 13 ana livea in the district from the age of 13 until the data collection period in 1990. Within ths group were 2,700 males and 2,641 females (Xu, et al, 199426). Between 1991 and 1992, the 722,599 individual residential registration files in each of the 12 neighborhood police offices were reviewed to identify those meeting the age and residency requirements who had records of delinquent or criminal behavior. Of the 5,341 born in 1973, the researchers identified 81 persons (1.5%) with records. 76 were male and 5 were female. This group became identified as Group A for research purposes. From the 5,341 in the cohort, a control sample of 81 was matched by gender, neighborhood background, parental economic status and occupation and neighborhood school district. This matched sample became identified as Group B and the combined sample of 162 is known as the \"Small Data Set.\" Groups A and B of the small data set were interviewed during this period. The charts presented by Wolfgang (NIJ, 1996) were based on the results of these interviews, which were tabulated by the Hubei Provincial Police Statistical Bureau with summaries given to the Wuhan Team. The originally coded data were never returned but the Wuhan 15 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Team maintained the original hand-written survey instruments. Data fiom the original a instruments were never computer coded or statistically analyzed independent of the Police Statistical Bureau's summaries. Once the reports were published in Chinese (Xu, et al, 1994, 1996, 1997 ) and summarized in English (NIJ, 1996) the original instruments were relegated to the storage bins of a number of the Chinese researchers. Even though the interviewers had traveled in Wuhan and seven other provinces to follow up the original subjects during 1994-95 the data they collected were never coded and analyzed bemuse the team was Cismisseti due iu la& d fidiiig. It must be noted that the detailed infoimation from the residential registration cards from which the information on crime and delinquency among the original 5,341 in the cohort were not collected in the original study and thus no information was available on the entire cohort. The only available data fi-om which to ascertain information was fiom the original and follow-up of the 162 in the small data set. Thus, while the original project was defined as a cohort study it was merely a study of the original 81 offenders and a matched sample. Present Location, Sample, and Methodology Because there were no data available to relocate the original birth cohort identified by Wolfgang and the Chinese Team, what we call Cohortl, it became necessary for us to re-select the cohort from the files. We call this newly selected identification of a cohort as Cohort2. We used the same criteria to collect data on the Chinese cohort - all .persons in the Wuchang Ilistrict who were born in 1973. Since China has rigorously enforced the very restricted residential registration system (Dutton, 16 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.e 1992), population mobility has been minimal until recently, but there has been some migration. It is likely, therefore, that a vast majority of those we identified as being in Cohort 2 were also in Cohortl but there will also be some who left Wuhan and some who migrated-in since Cohortl was identified. The district increased in size and complexity between 1990 and 2000 so that in 2000 Wuchang district was administratively re-divided into 15 neighborhoods with an equivalent number of neighborhood police precincts (Paichusuo) set up by the municipal government compared with twelve in the original investigation. The population in the district has also increased from 722,539 in IvYW to 821,115 in 2000, a near 100,000 increase in ten years (Guo et al, 2002: 14-1 5). The overall research strategy involved the following: 1. The first task was to locate the original hand-written data and interviews that constituted the small data set (N=162) from which the original statistics were generated. This proved somewhat dnfficult since they were never stored in a single location but were retained by those who worked on the project at the time. After searching storage boxes in a number of locations, they were eventually recovered. 2. All surveys needed to be translated and a codebook developed. The original surveys were exceptionally long. The translation was a joint endeavor by Professor Ren and a sociologist associated with the Wuhan Team. However, as will be noted later, translation of the original Chinese Characters used in the survey was difficult and resulted in some \"awkward\" English in order to maintain the intent of the survey questions. Once translated an SPSS file was created in English and the data entered. 3. We attempted to locate the original data from the 5,341 files, translate those data and enter them into our database. This proved not to be possible because demographic and other information on the all of the original cohort were never recorded as will be explained below. The data that were retained were the property of the Hubei Provincial Police Statistical Bureau, which generated the first tables. Whatever information that may have been collected on the entire cohort was not available in any format. 4. Consequently, we decided to re-do a birth cohort analysis of persons born in In this report, we will refer to these data as the \"Large data set\" or Cohort2. \\ 1973 and who lived in the Wuchang District fi-om age 13 to 2000. 0 17 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.When the data were collected the second time for those born in 1973, the Wuhan Team estimated, based on the 1989 census, the population to be approximately 5,400 and printed that number of data collection instruments. However, the 2000 census, which was released in 2002 after our data collection, indicates that the number born in 1973 to be around 6,000. Additional forms were never printed to accommodate the larger number because, we believe, each police station merely completed all of the forms provided and never requested additional forms. We therefore estimate that because the Chinese Team used only 5,400 forms, we lost between 10 and 15% of the actual cohort. This means that since not everyone born in 1973 is included, our data set is not, technically, a cohort. We will use the term Cohort2, however, to indicate that it is not the original cohort useci by Wolfgang. Whiie tnis does not meet the formal definition of a cohort, we will treat it as such since it is close to the entire population and the missing data are, we assume, randomly distributed across the different police districts. IJsing the term also helps us to maintain consistency with Wolfgang's original use of \"birth cohort\". 5. It was then necessary to translate the information available from the residential registration files and to enter those data into an SPSS file. 6. Once the residential file information on Cohort2 was gathered, we then had a criminal history check completed on all persons in that population. The criminal history check included not only the officially registered crimes but also a check of the local police and community committee records of violations of the public safety violations. (See section Criminal Law vs. the Regulation of Public Safety Administrative Penalty below.) 7. The first part of the data analysis was on the data from the original small data set using the SPSS statistical package. Our first goal was to verify the previously released findings as generated by the statistical bureau in China and released by Wolfgang (NU, 1996). 8. Our second task was to analyze the new large data set using bivariate and multivariate statistics. 9. Finally, we compared the proportion of offenders found in the original review of files (1.5%) with that found in the Cohort2 data set (1.4%) up to age 18. We also endeavored to generate models to help explain who, in the Chinese population, were more likely to offend by 18 and then, who offended by age 27. 0 \\ 18 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The only way to check if-the data we have been provided are, in fact, the original data, we compared our tabulations with tables presented by Wolfgang in a video presentation to NIJ. The data match on the most critical of indicators. The total sample size is 162 with 81 identified as offenders and 81 as the matched group. They also match, exactly, the data presented in terms of the sample's completed education. Parents' educational levels are nearly the same, the difference in numbers for each level is the greatest for mother's level, but the proportions are about the same. The numerical difference between the Statistical Bureau data and ours is that they have 13 offenders with fathers with a college degree but our data have 14. We have one more high school graduate and one less middle school graduate than the video reports. Therefore, while the exact numbers are slightly different, we conclude that we have located and coded the original interviews that were submitted to the statistical bureau from whom the descriptive statistics were received. Due to the particular manner of coding thie variables administered by the Chinese Team it could not be clearly determined in some instances whether the lack of answers was representing \"missing data\" or subjects deliberately chose not to answer in substance. Some other variables were sub-divided into several dimensions and had to be considered as separate variables in terms of their substantial content. The research team decided to recode those variables in order to avoid any possible ambiguity of meaning, and in order to neutralize as far as possible the problem of \\ 19 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.e \"missing data\" vs. \"substantial answer in the negative\". The question of how to handle \"missing values\" is, of course, a particularly delicate one. Missing data is a major concern, which must be figured into all of the analyses conducted. If one is about to include missing values into the characteristics of a substantive variable, one has to check in advance whether excludinghncluding missing values will change, in effect, the \"direction\" of the results. Option 1 is to completely exclude those values. Option 2 , as widely used in social sciences, is to calculate at first the average every subject with a \"missing value\" this artificial average value. We refrained from this, however, on different reasons. One of them wadis that some original variables as constructed by the Chinese scholars contain both, negative and positive dimensions of the characteristics in substance whereas the scale shows only positive values, like (1) All are bad (2) some are bad (3) some are good (4) all are good. Only if all 4 characteristics were evenly distributed among those answering the question, the resulting \"average\" would also be somehow even. In case of skewed distributions some distortion may arise. One of the remedies, then, could be to transform the original scale in another, more suitable one, e.g. by assigning new negatively and positively poled values, then calculate the average, and eventually assigning this resulting negative or positive average value to the missing cases. We decided, however, to refrain also from such a solution, regarding the ambivalent hidden content of missing data, as mentioned above. We choose instead ancther cption, Le. a three step procedure. This Option 3 examines the influence of excluding missing cases at all in the calculation versus i\\nclucling them with the value \"O\", in terms of theory falsification, when comparing * 20 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.offenders with non-offenders. Only those variables should eventually be retained for further bivariate or multivariate analyses where the inclusion of the missing cases with \"Zero\" would produce either the same average as when excluding them or an average going comparatively against the general or one's own (explicitly stated) theoretical assumptions. To exemplify this: Negative peer group activities like hanging around, and delinquency are strongly correlated. So are family problems and delinquency. Consequently a bivariate calculation with the variables \"peer group activities\" ~&i~~ the resulting cross-tabulations, and a at least moderate correlation coefficients. What about e.g. the 25 per cent of subjects not answering either to the question of their peer group affiliation and/or the questions of parents educational style? e Let us assume that all \"silent subjects\" are official non-offenders wishing to hide actual delinquency, problematic behavior with their peers and/or \"shamefil\" family conditions. Then both, computer mns pertaining to (a) all subjects and (b) comparisons of non-offender and offender sub-groups may result in equal or lower correlation coefficients when including them in general calculations (peers x delinquency, educational style x delinquency, peers x educational style) as compared with calculations where they remain excluded. Let us assume then, in the opposite, that all \"silent subjects\" were officially recognized offenders with similar motives than the non-offenders. Then both, computer runs pertaining to (c) all subjt;cts and (d) comparisons of offender and non-offender sub- groups may result in equal or higher correlation coefficients when including them in c,alculations as compared with calculations where they remain excluded. Results (a), (b) I) 21 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.I and (c) would \"weaken\" the usual evidence, result (d) would make it \"stronger\". Positive (hidden) attitudeslmanners on the part of the official offenders are always objectively expected to work statistically in the direction of results (a) or (b) or (c). So eventually, after a number of general! discussions and a lot of time and energy consuming computer runs and inspections, all variables producing higher values of type (d) when using it in calculations with missing cases included were quashed for further (multivariate) analyses. Since nobody mows the actual distribution of positive vs. negative characteristics among \"silent\" offenders on the one side, and among \"silent\" non-offenders on the other side in our Wuhan sample, only variables producing \"robust\" data irrespective of whether or not missing cases are included seem sure enough in terms of avoiding potentially artificial results, and then theoretical conclusions. There is, however, no \"perfect\" way of dealing with missing cases in social science research in general, and in criminology in particular. Every researcher or research group has inevitably to make, apart fiom technical considerations, some value decisions. We made the decision to proceed as we did in order to gain the most insight into this valuable and unprecedented data source. All the recodes and other data operations are documented. They are not published here in order to avoid huge appendixes to the report. They can be shown, however, upon demand. We are even eager to write some articles deliberately concentrating on the relevant methodological issues. Other variables showing complete answers were also recoded when it seemed necessary to do so for clarifying the logical order of sequence. Just to provide an example: In Questionnaire A, item 8 is requesting from the subjects to answer the 22 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.question \"How do you think about getting along with schoolmates?\". The given order of sequence starts with (1) All are very fiiendly\", and goes on with (2) all are very ordinary, (3) most of them are very good and individuals are ordinary, (4) most of them are ordinary and individuals are very good, (5) not in good terms with quite a few of them, (6) look upon relations with schoolmates with indifference, and do not care. It seems obvious in methodological terms that the sub-divisions are not 100 per cent exclusive of each other. However, re-arranging of the order of sequence helps to make the variable at Iz~et generally &e&sfially u~l&~u~~~. -*--*-+T-~- ylj, \" ' '?'. [e), (41, (2), arid (5). We should point out at this time that we faced a major issue in translation. In this report we use a somewhat \"awkward\" English lranslation of the value labels. We do so because of the difficulty in having an accurate, literal translation from Chinese characters into English. The questionnaire was designed and translated by Wolfgang's original Chinese team and the questionnaire was approved by Wolfgang, lumself. We could not change the instrument ex post facto. Our goal was to be open and clear about what we had to work with. There was no way to reconstruct the data. Rather, we desired to preserve and use it. The Chinese author on our team had a lot of difficulty in understanding the Chinese wording used in the instrument. We tried to be as faithful to the meaning of the Chinese even though the IZnglish translation might be somewhat awkward. To change many of these into perfect English may actually loose the relative nature of the relationship of words in Chinese. The Chinese characters must be interpreted more in terms of holistic rather thm qxcific mezing. Chinese slang was also used making literal translation awkward so we tried to accommodate both the Chinese veaning and the English interpretation. There is always information lost in translation. a 23 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.As for the translation, we could offer a translation re-edited to suit the English speakers' \"taste\" better, but we cannot guarantee it would be what Chinese team originally intended to ask. Our less-than-perfect English version is our way of staying as close to the original intent as possible. Identifying Offenders The offender sample was identified by reviewing two sets of available data. The first was the official criminal record, which includes what Americans would define as felony or heavy misdemeanor charges coming before the formal system of criminal justice. This is considered \"committing a crime\". The second was the record on so-called violations of public safety or public order regulations. Those violations fall under the jurisdiction of the local police. They represent either low-level misdemeanors not included in the Chinese penal code, or violations of social norms or disturbances of the public peace like \"hooliganism\". Neither type is considered a crime per se. However, on a scale of deviation they are \"breaking the law\", which is more socially problematic than just \"deviant behavior\". Violations of public safety regulations are often handled more informally, reflecting a long tradition in China's informal sanctions and control of deviance (Ren, 1997; Chen, 1973). However, the police can impose rather stiff administrative sanctions in particular cases (see below). A survey instrument was developed and administered to the 81 known delinquents/offenders. This survey wes deslged to gather details about the specific characteristics of the offending group. A second survey was given to both the offending group and the sample of persons matched by gender and school district to determine \\ 24 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Criminal Law vs. the Regulation of Public Safety Administrative Penalty The original version of Criminal Law and Criminal Procedural Law of PRC was formulated and promulgated by Chinese National People's Congress in 1979 and subsequently underwent radical revision in 1997. It refines and categorizes criminal acts ir_ ter! categories: national cecufity; 3,) crime Rgpiwt pllhlir CaWy; 3) crime against socialist economic order; 4) crime infringing citizen's constitution and democratic rights; 5) crime against property; 6) crime against public order; 7) crime against national defense; 8) embezzlement and bribery; 9) comption; and 10) violation of military servicemen's duties. The punishment ranges from criminal fines to probation, suspended sentence, to prison sentence including life imprisonment to death penalty. When an offender is accused of a crime that violate the criminal law, he/she is subject to judicial trail by either judge alone or by panel of three judges. The conviction will result in sentence ranging from fines to imprisonment. The Regulations of Public Safety Administrative Penalty was originally formulated in 1986 as result of sharp increase in juvenile and youth crime in post-Mao reform in 1984. Later in 1986, the National People's Congress adopted the Regulations and subsequently amended them in 1994. The Regulations define 20 categories of lliolatioiis that are subject to administrztive penalties. If the following criminal acts are too trivial to be prosecuted at criminal courts, they may be punishable under the Regulations of Public Safety Administrative Penalty (Institute of Legal Reform of Fujian Province, 1992; Liao, 1997; Men, 1996): \\ 25 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It is defined under the Law of Education through Labor'). Planting or use of controlled substances may subject to fines up to 3000 yuan, detention up to 15 days or detention in educational camp through labor between 1 and 3 years.

The data were originally collected by two different groups -police cadets and university students. They started at the 12 district police offices in the Wuchong District where both notes on criminal records and dolcuments on public safety violations as handled by the police themselves, are usually kept. They then went to the neighborhood committees within the districts to double check registrations of public security violations. The reason for this was that in Wuhan, as elsewhere, the police followed the tradition of assigning individual neighborhood police officers to each neighborhood; and these officers might not have reported minor violations to the central office but just kept the notes on the local committee premises. Therefore:, a complete record check was made. ' Law of Education through Labor was formulated in 1957 to dispose those politically reversionary of Guomingdong (Republic government) and opposition against the people's government. Late this law was revised to dispose the petty criminals who were not qualified for criminal sanctions under the penal code. $n 1983, the National People's Congress radically revised the law. The offenders subject to education through labors are mainly those judged to be guilty of violation of The Regulation of Administrative Penalty for Public Safety. 27 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The original process of selecting and identifying offenders and the data collection instruments were the sole decision of the Chinese Team in consultation with Professor Wolfgang. Some of those decisions now make analysis difficult if not, in some instances, impossible. For example, the original instrument did not collect the actual age at which the subject committed hisher first offense or the age at whkh they were 15-17! Likewise, offenses were placed into limited categories into which most offenders fall: burglary, fighting, and hooliganism. The offenses were thus categorized rather than reported verbatim. Data collection procedures initially employed in China made it impossible to substantiate some data. Data on all of the individuals in the original cohort were never recorded. We have data only on those originally determined to have had a record and a matched sample from the total 1973 cohort. The substantial amount of missing data suggests the results should be viewed with caution. Nonetheless, as an exploratory study of Chinese criminality, the current project can be viewed as providing an important \"first step\" in understanding some of the dynamics of crime in this developing, communist society during a period of rapid social change. Basic Characteristics Offense Rate Eighty-one of'the 5,341 in the cohort represent 1.5% of the population coming before the authorities for delinquent/ criminal behaviors. Of these 81, 47 (58.1%) were \\ 0 28 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department.

The proportion of the male cohort with some type of record is 2.8% while the proportion of females is 0.2%. Because of the small number of offenders in general and the small number of females in particular, the offender group is comprised of both sexes. An analysis of gender is in a separate section below. China's iegd spem is a ceritraihd we. Under modem Chinese law there is a distinction between Penal Law Offenses and Public Safety or Public Security violations as indicated above. The details of that distinction are complicated (Ren, 1996). Basically, however, it is referring to a material concept of differentiating \"true crime\" (menacing the fundamental moral order of society) from mere \"misconduct\" disturbing public peace and safety. In consequence of that, criminal acts will be punishable under the Penal Code or types of misconduct may be penalized under Public Safety Regulations or by local or provincial regulations. Crimes are dealt with by the criminal justice system. The police are but investigatorsAaw enforcers in that respect preparing the cases for the prosecuting authority. Public safety offenses, on the other hand, are fully dealt with by the police. Central police authorities are empowered to impose rather stiff sanctions, up to putting the offender into a program of \"education throu'h labor,'' which may consist of sending him away \u20acor from a couple of months to up to three years fiorii his residence in a remote camp where he has to work under close surveillance. According to Chinese law, such a qamp is not to be considered a prison and the penalty is not considered as punishment, 0 29 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.merely \"administrative discipline\", even if the individual is experiencing a deprivation of liberty. Imprisonment in formal terms, sometinlies called \"reform through labor\", is being reserved for those convicted of a crime in its absolute meaning. Consequently, a person violating \"only\" a public safety regulation after having been released from prison may not be considered a recidivist in formal terms and is thus not counted in the official recidivism statistics (Li, Junren, 1992). He may, nevertheless, be considered a person strongly endangering public safety, and dealt with accordingly by tk public safety O~~UIIL. For the purpose of this project, the most interesting issue is that the same physical act can be either a crime or a public safety violation depending on, the gravity of the act, the kind of its consequences for the victim or the public, and the motivation or social vs. anti-social orientation of the offender. This is analogous to the misdemeanodfelony distinction in the U.S. Therefore, for example, smashing a window of a school may be either an act of causing \"criminal damage\" (Penal Code offense) or an act of \"destroying public property\" (Regulation of Public Safety Administrative Penalty). Attacking another person in the public, just to give another example, may constitute the crime of \"assault and battery on purpose\" or just the administrative offense of \"fighting\", depending on the situation, the objective circumstances of the behavior, and the persons involved.

It is well known that self-concept is an important aspect of human behavior and that the Self is an important factor in subsequent behavior. Human identities evolve through the interaction they have with parents, family, peers, and all others - friends or foes - who help condition, affirm or refUte the sense of their own existence (Mead, 1934; Blumer, 1962; Friday, 1983). As social animals, the human condition struggles to reach a balance between the sense of individualism and an expression of Self and the need and dependence of being part of the collective. This struggle is exacerbated or enabled by the immediate and wider social conditions within which the interaction takes place. One's self-concept and social identity influence the behaviors one sees as consistent with that self-image. The colmbination of personality and social role influence how any social situation is defined and the behaviors one defines as appropriate for the situation. Previous research has indicated thal self-assessment is highly associated with delinquency (Dinitz et al., 1958, 1962; Scarpitti et al., 1960; Simpson et al., 1960; Kaplan et al. 1972, 1982, 1986). The following shows that offenders see themselves as having more \"bad habits\" than non-offenders have. (Data are included if at least half of each sample responded). o Offenders are more likely than non-offenders to consider they have the bad habits of being greedy, smoking, drinking, fighting and just being fond of \"playing around\".

Initially we had planned to enter each of these variables into a series of logistic regression equations grouped into separate conceptual domains (ie., school factors, family factors, peer fixtors, etc.). In preparation, new variables were created by dichotomizing each of the variables shown to be significantly different for the offenders and non-offenders. Careful screening of the data, however, led to the realization that data considerations limited our analytic strategy. Zero or low cell counts caused the problem, which most frequently affected these anz,Iyses. The probiems associated with zero or low cell counts were caused by the clear differences between offenders and non-offenders. :For several variables, few or no offenders or non-offenders indicated the response. For example, no non-offenders indicated that their fathers were unemployed and no offenders indicated that they had attended cultural lectures \\ a during school. Clearly, these variables differentiated between offenders and non-offenders This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This, however, causes a problem for estimation in the regression analysis, as the \"variable\" becomes a constant for one group 0 (Menard 1995). In some cases, it was possible to address the issue by collapsing categories. For example, none of the offenders had indicaled that they had wanted to be \"the best\" students in school. In this case, the four existing categories (never thought about it, middle level, and above middle level, the best) were collapsed into three (never thought about it, middle level, and above middle levelhest). While such procedures do result in a loss of some information, we viewed this as an acceptable altejmative to discarding the variables from the analysis. A similar system was used for the stage of education completed, stage of education the subject wanted to complete, feelings if forced to leave school, reason the subject left school, and relations with teachers. For other variables, however, this was not possible. For example, none of the offenders indicated that they had received a monetary incentive as a family disciplinary measure. Because this was a dichotomous response (i.e., they had been disciplined in this e manner or they had not), there was no way to recode this variable in a meaningfd way (Menard 1995). Similar limitations led us to exclulde a number of measures of subjects' ideal job (Le., research in natural and social sciences, political and legal work, specialized household), role models (Le., millionaire, party or government leader), and things deemed important in life (Le., good behavior). Thus, the results from the regression analyses are to be viewed with these caveats in mind. School Variables The first set of regression analyses examined the effect of three types of school variables. The previous analyses suggested that offending status was linked to educational achievement, student aspirations, and the reason that subjects left school. In the following '. a analyses, offender status was regressed on level of education completed (junior high or This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

The regression analyses were conducted in a series of equations, each of which added a new variable to the equation. In Model 1, ofknder status was regressed on the level of education completed. As the variable was initiailly constructed, respondents were able to identify whether they had completed one of four educational levels: 1) primary school, 2) junior middle schooi, 3) senior middle school, or 4j university. After reviewing the descriptive statistics for these variables, however, it was clear that none of the offenders had completed the university and few (3.7%) of the non-offenders had completed primary school only, thus raising the problem of low cell counts described earlier. To compensate, we dichotomized the educational level variable into lwo categories: 1) completion of primary school or junior high school as highest level of education and 2) completion of senior middle school or university as the highest level of education. This allowed us to examine the influence of the theoretically important concept of educational attainment while also addressing the low cell-count problem existing in the data. As can be seen in Table 26, non- offenders were much more likely (Exp(B)=l6.300) than offenders to have completed senior high school or university. 0 Next, a control for whether the student dropped out or had been expelled from school, regardless of the final level of education completedl. This variable was included as a proxy for the reason a respondent left school to determine whether this rzduced the effect of final educational level completed on offender status. Respondents who indicated that they had beqn expelled or dropped out were coded 1, while those who did not report having been expelled or dropped out were coded 0. Results fkom Model 2 show that dropping out of school increased the odds of being an offender approximately 10 times, while also slightly 8 57 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.reducing the independent effect of final level of education completed. Nevertheless, level of education completed remained a salient predictor of offending status, increasing the odds of 0 becoming an offender by approximately 12 times. A control for students' relationships with teachers was added to Model 3 to determine whether this conditioned the effects of level of education completed and reason for leaving school. Students were asked to describe their relations with teachers while they were in school. Respondents were asked to pick from four choices: 1) Very Good, 2) Good, 3) Ordinary, 4) Not Good, or 5) Do not care. Folr the regression analyses, we recoded Not Good/Do Not Care into a single category and Good/Very Good into a single category. Results from Model 3 show that the strength of relationships between level of education completed and offending and between drop out status and offending remain salient, even when the effects of student-teacher relationshps are factored in. We also see, however, that the effect of educational attainment and drop out status are tempered somewhat when student- teacher relationships are introduced. Thus it appears that structural factors such as level of education completed and reason for leaving school have important effects on the likelihood 0 that one will become an offender, but the strength of these effects can be mediated by the quality of student-teacher relationships while in school. To determine whether it was having good relationships with teachers that prevented offending or having poor relationships that enhanced offending, we used \"ordinary relations with teachers\" as the reference category in these regression analyses. This approach allowed us to examine both \"risk\" and \"protective\" factors on offending behaviors (see, for example, Hawkins, Catalano, and Miller 1992 for a discussion of this approach). Looking closer at Model 3, we see that respondents with poor relations with teachers were more than seven times more likely to be offenders than respondents who reported ordinary relations with teachers, controlling for the effects of educational attainment and drop out status. When 0 examining whether having strong relations with teachers insulated respondents from This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.becoming offenders (ie., was a protective factor), this relationship was not supported. Compared with those who reported ordinary relations with teachers, respondents who indicated that their relations with teachers were strong were not significantly less likely to be 0 offenders, controlling for the effects of educational attainment and drop out status. Thus, it appears that having poor relations with teachers is a risk factor increasing the likelihood of becoming an offender, but having strong relationships with teachers is not a salient factor protecting individuals from becoming offenders, once the effects of educational attainment and reasons for leaving school are taken into accoiunt. Model 4 added student aspirations to the equation. Respondents were provndea fuur categories-1) The Best, 2) Above Middle, 3) Middle Level, 4) Do Not Care-and asked to indicate where they had striven to be (relative to their classmates) while attending school. Based on the work of Hirschi (1969) and others, we hypothesized that respondents who had strong educational aspirations would be less likely to be offenders than other respondents. 0 Reviewing the descriptive pattern of the data for this variable also illustrated the problem with low cell counts , necessitating our decision to combine responses of \"the best\" and \"above middle\" into a single category and used this category as the reference. The results of Model 4 illustrate that student aspirations were not significant predictors of offending status, controlling for the effects of educational achievement, reasons for leaving school, and student-teacher relations. Finally, students' feelings if they had been forced to quit school were added to the equation in Model 5. Students were asked to indicate whether they would have felt 1) Disappointed, 2) Happy, or 3) Would Not Have Cared if they had been forced to quit school. We hypothesized that having been happy to quil. school or not having cared if they were foqced to quit school would increase the likelihood of becoming an offender relative to those who would have been disappointed to have had to quit school, even in the presence of other school-related factors. The results from the final model, however, show that students' This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.feelings if they had been forced to quit school did not significantly influence the likelihood of becoming an offender when the other school-related variables were included. I a To summarized, the results from these analyses suggest that the most important school factors associated with offending are those relating to structural variables-level of education completed and drop out status-and interactions between students and teachers. The effects of these variables remained strong in each model: in the final model, dropping out or being expelled from school increased the likelihood of being an offender by more than eight-fold, while subjects having low educational achievemenit were more than nine times more likely to be offenders. Additionally, subjects who dia nor care about or Inad poor reiarions with teachers were more than seven times as likely to be offenders as subjects who had average relations with teachers. The relationship did not work the other direction, however, as having good ,relationships with teachers did not significantly reduce the likelihood that subjects would become offenders. Additionally, subjects ' educational aspirations and feelings if forced to quit school also had no significant effect on offending status once the effects of the other school variables were controlled. 0 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

For the regression analyses reported herein, three types of family factors were examined: 1) parental expectations of the subject, 2) parental-subject interactions, and 3) parental relations. The choice of these variables merits some discussion. As with the school-related factors, the data presented us with a number of challenges to overcome when conducting the multivariate analyses. Conceptual and empirical concerns severely hampered our options in this examination. We were again confronted with the empirical reality of striking bivariate differences between offenders and non-offenders on the family variables included in the survey. For example, parental disciplinary tactics, a variable found to be of considerable importance in previous studies (see, for example, Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber 1986 or Gottfredson and Hirsch 1990 for reviews), showed that no non-offenders reported that parents used beating or scolding as a method of discipline, compared with more than one-third of offenders. (Also note the reverse pattern concerning use of material incentives as disciplinary method.) Clearly, these bivariate patterns differentiated offenders from non- offenders, but the pattern was so evident that it was not possible to enter this in the multivariate regression analyses. Also of conceni was the fact that many of the variables included in the survey were asked in a manner that made it unclear which concepts were being measured. These difficulties ultimately led us to explore other avenues to examine the relationships in a multivariate setting (see the discussion of the disadvantage index described below). As with the examination of the school-related factors, the regression analyses examining the relationships between family variables and offending status were conducted in a series of steps. First, offender status was regressed on parental expectations of the \\ a respondent's occupational future. Model 1 regressed offending status on the parental 62 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.expectation that the respondent would become a worker (yes=l). Consistent with the results presented earlier, respondents whose parents had wanted them to become workers were more than twice as likely as other respondents to be Offenders. This factor, however, explained very little of the variance in offender status (Nagelkerke R2=.056), and the effect became non-statistically significant once other family factors were introduced. Thus, it appears that the bivariate relationship between parent's occupational expectations and offending status is due to other factors. Model 2 introduced a proxy measure of parent-subject interactions. Respondents were asked whether fathers had assisted in school-related studies. Respondents who indicated that their fathers had helped them were coded 1, wlhile all other respondents were coded 0. Results show that offenders were significantly less likely non-offenders to report that fathers had helped them in their studies, controlling for parental expectations. When the parent- subject interaction variable was introduced, the previously observed significant effect of parental expectation that the subject would become a worker on offender status dropped to less than would be expected by chance. From these results, it appears that parental-subject interactions in homework activities, rather than parental expectations that one would become a worker, was an important predictor of offender status. a Fathers' expectations of respondents' school performance was then added to the equation (Model 3). Respondents were asked what type of students their fathers had expected them to be: (1) The Best, (2) Above Middle Levell, (3) Middle Level, or (4) Did Not Care. We then examined whether respondents whose father had low (i.e., middle level) or no (i.e., did not care) expectations of them as students were more likely to be offenders than respondents whose fathers had higher expectations for them as students (ie., above middle level or the best). Results of the analyses show that respondents whose fathers had no or low expectations of them as students were each more thlan five times as likely to be offenders as 0 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.those whose fathers had high expectations, when parents expectations of future occupational status and parental assistance in schoolwork were controlled. a The final model (Model 4) examined whether the quality of parental relations affected offender status once the effects of the other family variables were controlled. Respondents who indicated that their parents could be described as \"often quarreling7', \"not very good\", or \"divorced\" were coded as 1 (indicating poor parental relations), while respondents reporting relations were \"fairly good\" or \"ordinary\" were coded as 0. When entered into the logistic regression analysis, those with poor parental relations were no more or less likely to become offenders, when the effects of occupational and educational expectations by parents and parent-respondent interactions in schoolwork were controlled. Indeed, fathers expectations concerning what type of student would become was the only significant predictor of offending status. Respondents whose fathers had low or no expectations for the type of student they should be were more than five times as likely to be offenders than respondents who indicated their fathers had high expectations of them as students. Thus, these results suggest those fathers' expectations for youth is more important in determining offending status than are a factors such as interactions within the family for these Chinese subjects. e '. hA This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We were again confronted with many of the same analytical issues that had plagued us in the multivariate analyses of school and family variables. Drawing fkom the prior literature, we chose to focus on three conceptual domains: importance of peer relationships, whether peers were delinquent, and amount of time exposed to peer influences. We again conducted these analyses in a series of steps. The first model regressed offending status on whether a subject viewed a friend as a role model (yes=l). This measure was used as a proxy for the importance of friends in subjects' lives. The results of Model 1 show that respondents who viewed a friend as a role model were more than three times more likely to be offenders than were respondents who did not view a friend as a primary role model. Next, a proxy measure of exposure to delinquent peers was entered into the model (Model 2). Respondents were provided a checklist of words and asked to select all that could describe their friends. One of the response options consisted of the words \"cause trouble.'' For these analyses, all respondents who classified their friends as trouble makers were coded as 1, while those who did not select this option were coded as 0. Results from the analyses in Model 2 show that respondents who indicated that they were exposed to delinquent peers were nearly 7 times more likely to be offenders than those who were not exposed to delinquent peers, controlling for the importance of friends as role models. Having a friend as a role model remained a salient predictor of offending status, even in the presence of exposure to delinquent peers. e \\ This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Females did, however, report that their fathers had more education than males' fathers, as the majority of females' fathers (60%) had completed a specialized secondary school or college while the majority of males' fathers (53.3%) had completed .- primary or junior middle school (chi-square=9.385, p=.052). Perhaps of more interest here, males and females differed in the types of offenses for which they had been sentenced. AX of the females had been sentenced for \"breaking the law,'? while nearly half (44.7%) of the males had been sentenced for \"committing a crime.\" This difference was statistically significant (chi-square=3.855, pz.050). \\ 67 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

When asked about what type of student they had wanted to be in school, a larger percentage of males than females fell in the extreme categories, never thinking about it (34.2% to 0.0%) or wanting to be the best (9.2% to 0.0%). Conversely, a larger percentage of females than males reported wanting to be average (60.0% to 38.2%) or above average (40.0% to 18.4%) in school. These differences were statistically significant (chi-square=7.687, p=.053). Females were also more likely than males to report that their fathers helped them study (60% to 29.6%, chi-square4.018, p=.045). Nevertheless, no significant differences were found between males and females in terms of the stage of education, which they wanted to or actually did complete, their feelings if solmething unexpected would have caused them to discontinue schooling, or of their general perceptions of school or of relationships with teachers or other students. There were no significant differences between male and female subjects and the activities in which they engaged in while in school. Nearly all subjects reported participating in visits to cultural places and engaging in social activities of public interest. Conversely, none of the students reported taking part in the social survey or looking after 68 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.Labor Outlooks and Participation Perceptions of labor while in school revealed both similarities and differences between the sexes. For instance, 40 percent of the females but only about 14 percent of the males agreed, \"It is good to build up the habit of participating in labor from childhood, so students should participate in labor.\" Conversely, a greater percentage of males than females (40.8% to 10%) agreed with the statement \"students should participate in self-service labor and need not participate in productive labor.\" No significant differences between males and iemales, however, were found on the remaining perceptions of labor. A list of fourteen items deemed by the researchers to be potentially important in life were then provided, and the subjects were asked to choose the three, which they felt, were most important. Results suggested that males and females differed in the importance placed on each of these areas. The difference between males and females who indicated that power and influence were most important was large and statistically significant (55.3% to 0%). Similarly, a ,greater percentage of males than females highlighted the importance of position and influence (39.5% to lo%), although this difference was not statistically significant at the .05 level. In contrast, females were more likely than males to select a strong or healthy body (80% to 0%) or happiness in marriage (70% to 0%) as being the most important. 69 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Consistent with research from the West and with control theory assumptions, non-offenders are more likely to express traditional social values, morals, and to have personal expectations reflecting greater social integration, achievement, cultural awareness. The non-offending population in China has greater social awareness and a greater orientation toward social conscience and Chinese society than offenders. The findings above are consistent with the general findings found in the Western literature on the etiology of crmit: ami delinquency. 71 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Public Safety Regulation Violations and Criminal Law violations were checked starting in June 1991 for those meeting the birth year (1 973) and residency requirements (lived in Wuhan from age 13 to 18), for offenses up to the age of eighteen. Of the 5,341 born in 1973, 2,700 males and 2,641 females, the researchers identified 8 1 persons (1 S%) with records. 76 were male and 5 were female. The characteristics of this group are described above in the analysis of the Small Data Set. Our initial design was to track the original 5,341 in 2000, making the cohort 27 years old. Unfortunately, the original 5,341 files could not be located. As it turned out, the data collection process in 1991 included only the identification of offenders and they were then matched with non-offenders (the small data set). No information on the entire cohort was ever gathered or recorded. In short, we had no real cohort we could follow. The decision was then made to go back to the existing files and re-select a cohort born in 1973. It was assumed that many of this cohort would be the same as in the original, but there was no certainty of that since there had been in and out-migration since the original study. However, we would, none-the less, have a 1973 cohort, which could be compared with the Driginal in terms of the proportion offending. The process involved 72 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.checking all of the existing individual files in 2000, which were at this time now located in 15 Civil Service Offices, each with a police station. On an estimate of the I973 birth cohort made by the Chinese Team, 5,400 data collection instruments were generated and distributed to the offices to identify and record information on those born in the district in that year. The researchers then reviewed 821,115 files, completing the 5,400 forms. Unfortunately, at the time of the data collection, there was no accurate census available. The researchers completed all of their n \\ -I: +I. ad then (Ldt,2,, LII~L mi 5,400 instruments were inadequate and that we actually only have a sample of the cohort that represents approximately 85-90 percent of the actual cohort. This, technically, does not meet the criterion of a birth cohort, but it does represent a substantial proportion, in essence randomly selected across all civil and police stations. Nearly a thousand inte~iewerslsurveyors were used for the data collection process (Guo et al., 2002) from three institutions: students from Central China Normal University and Wuhan College of Management of Public Safety and police officers selected from the 15 police stations. Review of the data collected in 2000 showed considerable missing data. After eliminating the files with insufficient information, the 1973 cohort identified in 2000 is 5,338. The 2000 cohort is comprised of 2,883 ma.les, 2,428 females and, while other data were available, 27 of our cases were missing information on gender. Interestingly, the cohort sample ideidifned in 2000 (which will be referred to as Cohort2 to distinguish it from the original used by Wolfgang) is not substantially different from the original group collected in 1991. While the gender proportions are a 73 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.slightly different (50.5% male in 1991 and 54.0% in 2000), the proportion of offenders by the age of 18 is nearly the same. We selected only the files for those with recorded public safety regulation violations and/or criminal law violations prior to 1992, (which was the cut-off date of the original search). For the cohort identified in 2000 there are 46 violators of Public Safety regulations compared with 47 in the original report and 34 criminal code violations - the same as the original report. Rather than 81 offenders as reported in the original research, we found 76: 71 males (compared with 76 in the Data from the files included only 27 items, which were eventually split into 48 separate variables. Several of those items are very important for determining the basic characteristics of the cohort. However, they do not serve further meaningful analyses of the data in terms of criminological questions/theories. For example, item 3 on the census data shows a rather equal distribution of the months of birth in the relevant year. Item 6 shows that 88.5 per cent of the subjects were born in Wuhan City (70.9 per cent) or around Wuhan City in some other place of Hubei Province (17.6 per cent). That means that the large majority of subjects were indeed \"indigenous people\", and therefore comparable in terms of having been influenced by largely the same local socialization environment as we must assume for the original cohort. This is additionally demonstrated by item 7 showing that at the time of checking the police archives 98.4 per cent of the subjects had their home address in Wuhan City (98.1 per cent) or near the city in some other place of Hubei Province (.3 per cent) in 199 1. This does not mean, however, that all subjects stayed at the same place of living all (he time. Many were moving to another place or a couple of other places in their home 8 74 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Unfortunately, these data are restricted to information collected at each district census and police office. Since the original study was done, China has restructured the nature of its local committees by making them more formal in structure and nature. Our intent was also to review the files of the local committees, which would have information on minor deviant acts and interventions, but the restructuring resulted in a change in the e nature and function of these committees so that such data are no longer available. This also coincides with an increased sensitivity to the use and release of individual information. The result is that these data could not be used as a check of reliability for the findings. What we have for data, then, is infomation in the official files regarding both public safety regulation violations and criminal violations. Because we had to re-check the entire population to redefine a 1973 cohort, it is our belief that the comparison of results from the data first revealed in the Wolfgang (1 994) report and the Chinese reports (Xu, 1994, 1994, 1997) will either validate the original findings or seriously question them. 75 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Religious affiliation, educational level, marital status, mobility, and offending variables were collapsed for the bivariate and multivariate analyses. Whenever possible, the variables were ranked in a theoretically meaningful manner. were assigned positive values, while variables cll assified as \"risk\" or enhancing offending were assigned negative values. Despite eliminating a number of cases due to nearly all information being missing, missing data still posed a problem for some of the variables (e.g., religion, where the religious affiliation of29% of the sample was unknown). In these cases, the missing data were assigned a value of zero. For example, individuals who were known to have any religious affiliation were coded as +1, those for whom religious affiliation was undetermined (missing) were coded 0, and those with no religious affiliation were coded -1. This allowed us to include missing in the analysis and yet not have it confused with a no response. We were also interested in residence changes or stability. Our data included information on residence changes and the reasons for those changes. Therefore, we were able to create \"moving\" variables. The \"moving\" variables were handled in a slightly different manner than the other rccodes and transfomaiions. First, they were dichotomized into having moved (i.e. moved in or out of Wuhan) or not moved. Next, ordinal moving variables (separate for having moved in and out) were created based on the reasons provided for moving. It was determined, for example, that some of the \\ 0 76 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.reasons for moving (ie., to enter a higher school, obtain a new job, or change an existing job) were for \"positive\" reasons, while others were for \"negative\" or at least not clearly positive reasons and could be seen as being more disruptive than stabilizing (i.e., following parents, changing a home address, or other reasons). The determining factor here was whether the move could be interpreted as for one's \"advancement.\" Finally, new variables were created from the public safety regulation violations, criminal law offending, disposition, and punishment information. Separate dichotomous vmables were created to indicate whefher or not one haa com~~& a erst, secona, third or fourth public safety violation or criminal law offense or had received a first, second, third or fourth disposition or penalty (coded as 0-0, l=yes). This resulted in the creation of 16 new dichotomous variables. These variables were then used to create composite measures for the total number of public safety regulation violations, criminal law offenses, public safety dispositions, and criminal penalties (four scores, each possibly ranging from 0-4). Finally, a general offender scale was created for the combined total number of public safety violations and criminal offenses for each individual in the sample (possible range: 0-8.

Principle Findings Basic Cohort Demographics ]In Colu-t2, 54% are male, and 7904 of the cohort was born in Wuhan while the others resided there from the age of 13. In the 2000 check, members of the cohort were most likely to be married (52%) or single (47%), with few (less than 2%) divorced or widowed.

Only a rew (4%) of rht: saripie had military experience, and at the time of the study, members of the cohort were most likely to be employed as an employee in a state-owned industrial corporation (29%), a professional occupation (14%), or a state-owned retail or service entity (12.5%). An additional 21% of the cohort was currently unemployed. Offense Rate By age 18 Since the populations of the 1973 cohorts collected in 2000 and 1991 are different, the first comparison must be made between the two. As indicated above, Cohortl (1991 data) had 8 1 offenders by the age of 18 (1.5%). The record checks at age 18 for the 1973 cohort identified in 2000, found '76 (1.4%). We cannot say with certainty how many of the original Cohortl are, in fact, included in Cohort2. However, there exist good reasons to assume that Cohort2 includes most of the members, which were already included in Cohortl. With the basic offense rate the same and given the fact that both criminal law violations and public safety regulation violations were recorded, we feel that the results support the fact that one ''can trust\" the data collected from the Chinese police a 78 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We have confidence in the finding that there is a low rate of involvement in crime in the cohort since the 1991 and 2000 collectors were different persons. There does 0 not appear to be any way in which these data could nave been \"manipulated\" to generate such a low rate. Speculation by some that the Chinese may have attempted to present an artiiicial picture must be rejected. What is missing from the data, however, is the involvement in crime by what is known as the \"floating population\" in China. There are the unregistered internal migrants who are frequently homeless, involved in low level labor and who are g-Enerally considered LU be respunsiule fix much of the crime (Ma, 200 1) Since our task was not to measure crime in China but to follow a birth cohort, our findings apply only to the registered residents of Wuhan. For Cohort2, from the 2000 census and legal checks, 57 or 1 .l% of the sample members were recorded by the police as criminal offenders, and an additional 73, or 1.4% were recorded for public safety violations. None of the offenders was a \"chronic a offender\" in the sense of the Philadelphia Birth Cohort Studies I andor 11. In fact, 45 out of 57 criminal offenders were registered only once, 10 persons twice, 1 person 3 times and 1 person 4 times. Out of the 73 public safety violators, 69 were registered only once, 2 persons twice, 1 person 3 times and 1 person 4 times. There is evidently much similarity in the distribution of both types of violation. Eight (8) members of Cohort2 were registered for committing both, public safety and criminal offenses. Therefore, the \"actual\" number of offenders in Cohort2 is 122 out of5,338, or 2.3%, to age 27. The delinquency rate - to age 18 - was i.4% The increase in offenders between ages 18 and 27 from the cohort selected in 2000 was an increase of 37 new offending males and 9 offending females. The finding 0 79 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.that 37.7% of the offending population started their criminal behavior after age 18 is consistent with the proportions found in other longitudinal studies (Sampson and Laub, 1993; Tracy et al., 1990). 0 At age 27 Looking at the 37 males and 9 females who started their criminal activity afte. the age of18, the data show that all of the females who started their criminal activity as adults were charged with public safety regulation violations and none for criminal law violations. The age range of first public safety regulations violation for the new ~ - offenders is 19 to 27 (females 22-27) and the age at first criminal law violation for the males ranged from 19 to 25. These results still seem as extraordinarily low as they did when the Cohort1 data were first released. Wolfgang et al. (1972) had found in the Philadelphia Cohort I Study that some 35 per cent of their subjects had come in contact with the police up to their 18th birthday. Several studies in industrialized western countries (e.g. England and Germany) easily replicated the Philadelphia findings. However, the fact that we have rechecked the entire census population and have uncovered nearly exactly the same original distribution, suggests that the findings are real. The rate of criminal activity, whether measured by violations of public safety regulations or the commission of crimes, is exceptionally low in China. For the cohort as a whole, the likelihood of being involved in public safety violations or criminal offenses more than once is; also very rare, as second public safety regulation violations were uncovered for only 4 of the sample members and second criminal offenses for only 10. 80 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Warnings, detentions, or other dispositions each accounted for approximately 1/3 of the dispositions in first cases of public safety violations.

While the variable age was collapsed in the original Cohort1 study and 100% indicated that they first engaged in criminal activity between 15 and 17, the follow-up Cohort2 study shows the following: Table 31 Age at First Violation - Cohort2 Criminal Code Viol Female Female 81 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

This approach was previously used in the reanalysis of the original Philadelphia cohort (Kemer, Weitekamp and Schindler, 1995). While the variables we have to work with are extremely limited, we considered as \"risk\" the absence of bonds or rather loose bonds to conventional societal norms. This can be considered as reflective in the marital status and occupation variables. Likewise, risk might be considered in terns of being rather free of obligations for partnerdchildren or at \"disadvantage\" in terms of having fewer life chances than others in society as would be reflected in the education variable. Results from longitudinal studies show that offenders, and especially multiple offenders, are characterized by an accumulation of underprivileged and unstable life conditions. There is a continuity, and to some extent, an outgrowth of different problems. '. In early years they were more likely to suffer from harsh or erratic child-rearing practices 85 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.kd disrupted family relationships (Farrington 1995). In school they tend to have low attainment, were rejected by conventional peers and associate with delinquent peers (Stelly et al, 1998). In adult years persistent offenders tend to have trouble in the world of work, in family relationships and during military service (Sampson I' Laub 1993; Caspi et al. 1987). They experience downward occuplational mobility, are more likely to be unemployment and/ or exhibit erratic work lives and were also more likely to divorce. Their lives are more unstable in terms of settlement as well, as they move more frquently (Farrington i 995). Weitekamp and Kerner, (1994) at the Institute of Criminology, Tubingen, Germany, after a review of previous longitudinal research, have suggested that continuation or desistence in delinquent behavior is affected by the life chances a person has at different stages in hisher life course and that the consequences of crime, itself, contributes to these life chances. Life chances are due to available social resources. Weitekamp and Kerner argue that a variety lof social factors, which criminological research has revealed to be linked to delinquent behaviour, could be interpreted as social resources. For example the level of education, the availability of social networks, family structure, capabilities of conflict management and life planning are components of life chances, which at the same time affect the probability of delinquent behaviour. These kinds of resources influence the normative orientation of an individual, the learning of socially competent behaviour and thereby are crucial as to whether and how an individual is socially integrated. The impact of life chances on the probability of further crime results from the gdditional effects of single components of social resources. Caspi et al. (1987), who a 86 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.looked at outcomes of early antisocial behavior in later life, found additive effects. They found that people with temper tantrums, whom we assume to have poor capabilities in conventional conflict management, showed, on the average, more poor school attainment a than juveniles without that problem. This was true in general for those belonging to the working class and those of the middle classes. However, even students from the middle classes with a history of antisocial behavior were more successful in school than their more underprivileged classmates without that Iproblem. The advantage of a the time of leaving school, el'en though both factors appeared to be relevant. However, when people entered the working world the effects of class origin and capabilities in conflict management (early temper tantrums) as two components of social resources were about on the same level. Those with low class origin and low measures or temper tantrum had, on average, similar occupational status in the first job as those with higher origin status and high measures of previous handicap in conflict management. One a advantage is now fully counter-balanced by another disadvantage (or vice versa). The additive effect holds in other subgroups of the sample, too. That is, individuals with privileged social resources in both of the aforementioned aspects have the highest and those with both underprivileged resources have the lowest occupational status. Considering these factors, it is assumed that the more privileged social resources available, the more one has a chance of meaningful social participation and social integration and the lower the probability of multiple offending. In contrast, the more disadvantaged one is relative to social resources, the fewer life chances a person has and the higher the probability of multiple offending. Although social resources are 87 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.interrelated to each other, we expect that they are to a certain extent different aspects or e components of life chances. To put it another way, life chances are an outcome of the accumulation of these social resources. Disadvantage Index For heuristic purposes, we used the variables which were available to construct a Disadvantage Index. No effort is being made to suggest that these variables are in and of themselves sufficient to explain who persists and who does not persist in cnminal behavior. But the index does utilize previously documented indicators of social integration: education, occupation, and even religious affiliation. In reality, not every person without religious affiliation would automatically be endangered to become deviant as compared to those who profess religious affiliation. He a or she may instead have similar value-bonds in other respects. Likewise, not every person having only less than elementary education would automatically be predetermined for a criminal career. He or she may instead be just content with hisher position in society and be content doing a decent job at the lowest level of the economic hierarchy. So, for each variable for which we have data, there is no suggestion that scoring positive or negative is a determining factor in offending or not offending. On the average, seen from a late-industrial western society's point of view, persons having poor education, being unemployed, living as singles or divorced, lacking religious affiliation, and residing in the environment into which they had been born without any experience of moving to another place for achievement objectives rnight/would be considered as being under \"pressure\" or under \"heightened social stress\" 0 88 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

One time Offenders Repeat Offenders (2-t) Using only the variables available, the bivariate distributions show: (N = 5,216) (N = 105) 1.2 Yo 18.1 % Table 39 I I (N= 17) 17.6 % Risk / disadvanta e factors: 68.2 84.2 Status: SingleDivorced Religion: No Religion Moving: No Positive Moving Experience I I 19.4 % 141.0 % 170.6 % 164.7 % I 45.8 % The Disadvantage Index is generated by assigning \"points\" to each person. One (1) point was assigned if the individual's situation could be seen as theoretically disadvantaged while zero was assigned if the condition was considered neutral or positive. Thus, for school, 1= elementary education or less; for occupation, unemployment = 1; for marital status, 1= single or divorced; and for religion, 1= no religion. Using these four variables, the distribution of points is as follows: 89 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Our data indicated each move of those in the sample and the reasons for those moves. For this variable we considered that 1= no positive moving. Calculating the accumulated points for non-offenders, one-time and repeat offenders show the following distribution: Table 41 a General Delinquency Scale (crimes + violations) Non-Offenders Offenders Repeat Offenders (2+) One time (N = 5,216) (N = 105) (N= 17) Non-Offenders Both calculations show that offenders are more likely to have a higher number of points on the Disadvantage Index.

The rather clear cut and remarkable result is shown below: General Offender Scale (crimes + violations) Members Disadvantage Index Members in the Registered as Members Registered as POINTS Sub-Group Offenders Offenders N N Per Cent of the Sub-Grow Table 42 One I 2.458 I 42 I 1.7 % What is evident from the data above is that as one accumulates \"points\" (in any combination of variables) on the Disadvantage Index, the proportion of offenders is greatest.

We began'with looking for some other variables in the data set that could possibly help to differentiate further between offenders and non-offenders in a meaningful way, like the birthplace of the subject's father , the question whether or not the subject was still living with his or her parents or the question whether or not the subject had military service experience. We then used the following procedures: a) we started with univariate and bivariate runs, filtering out variables with too many missings or showing no substantial variation at all, b) we then included the Index variables and the remaining additional variables in a common file, and made correlational analyses, including correlation matrices, c) we then took only those variables that came out with good or at least decent correlation coefficients (>. 25) and put them in factor analyses, d) these factor analyses started with the Index variables all being qualified for inclusion, and then the other still relevant variables were added stepwise. It turned out in this reanalysis that the Index variables as originally selected were the dwisive ones. Using them only led to clearly distinctive three primary hciors with methodologically sufficient Eigenvalues greater than 1, and also with the best results in terms of minimal loading of single variables on more than one factor at once. a '.

Results from these ANOVA runs, which will not be shown here in detail due to lack of space, suggest that non-offenders, one-time offenders and multiple offenders differ significantly (p < .001) on each of the three factors. More specifically, multiple offenders had the highest scores (and the non-offenders the lowest) on the Social Position Factor (with unemployment and low education) and on the Social Stability Factor (with single or divorced marital status). On the No Religion Factors one-time offenders scored even a bit higher than multiple offenders whereas non-offenders a \\ 97 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

To Eurther elaborate on the utility of the Disadvantage Index, offenders (in common) and non-offenders were examined separately. The results confirmed that for both the non- offending and the offending samples, the three distinct factors were evident. For the non-offenders, the Factor I explained 24,6 % variance and was mostly determined by a positive (average or even elevated) employment status, a high educational ail king IaZiid, Fci~to~ Ii explained 21.2 % variance and was mostly determined by a positive (more than average or even very high) educational status and married marital status, and even higher religious affiliation than in factor I; Factor I11 explained 20.4 % variance and was rather uniquely determined by the existence of an officially known religious affiliation. For the offending sample, the Factor I explained 30.8 % of the variance with high factor loadings for lack of religious affiliation, a positive (rather average) employment status, and a high married marital status; the Factor I1 explained 21.3 % variance and was rather uniquely determined by moving out of reasons that had nothing to do with achievement orientation; Factor I11 explained 20.4 % variance and was rather uniquely determined by education, but achievement oriented moving ( i.e. negative sign for not positive moving) took an additional role. The moving variable loaded on all factlors for both groups. The main (technical) reason seems to be that ofl'enders and non-offender alike moved in and oiit of their districi a couple of times and out of different reasons during the life period under consideration, and tbat only motives like \"better educational opportunity\" or \"higher occupational position\" e 98 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

On the other hand, motives taken here as \"neutral\" like moving with the family could actually have had a negative implication (e.g. family left the place due to some deviance on the part of parents or children) or a positive implication (e.g. father gained a new prestigious job at another district).

In case of contradictions the approach would have to be considered leading only to artificial results and therefore futile. In case of confirmation of the basic tendency the multivariate procedures would contribute to a better understanding of the preliminary findings or could at least be considered as providing corroborate evidence for the existence of more than spurious relationships. However: even the strongest statistical results were to our opinion not to be considered as capable of \"proving\" a theory. Our goal was to see if and how far borne basic demographic ana oiher variabies cot,iCi in any sound way differentiate between those who offended and those who did not in the Chinese cohort. We feel they can. In order to better comprehend the structural similarities on the one hand, and the differences in the extension of the variable factor loadings on the other hand, we attempted a third approach to the data. We took the factor loadings for all variables of all subjects in the offender vs. the non-offender groups in each of the three factors, calculated the totals, and ranked them in order of their magnitude. The substantial meaning of the variables was additionally double-checked with the distribution of the categories in the recoded variables for each sample. The results can be neatly demonstrated in Figure 5. The left side of the figure looks at each variable using the non-offender as the reference group and the right side uses the offenders as the reference group. The factor loadings were multiplied by 1,000. The figure reflects the differences in the factor loadings when each group is used as the comparison group and is based on the following chart. 100 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We 0 calculated both the differences emerging when using the non-offenders as reference group, and then the differences emerging when using the offenders as reference group. The following results show a rather clear-cut distinction that is consistent with the results we found previously: (1) Factor loadings summing up to higher totals for non-offenders than for offenders: Religious affiliation = 5, 143 points uifference. Having moved with achievement motivation = 873 points difference. Still single at the age of 18 = 5 1 1 pioints difference. Higher level of education = 292 points difference. Student or, if already employed, rather high level of occupation = 15 points difference. (2) Factor loadings summing up to higher loadings for offenders than for non- offenders : Lack of religious affiliation = 1,150 points difference. Not moving or having moved out of other than achievement motivations = 649 points difference. Expelled/dropped out or having lower level of education = 5 16 points difference. Married by the age of 18 = 415 points difference. Unemployed or rather low level of occupation = 167 points difference. This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

We believe that we have validated the'original finding that the proportion of the 1973 birth cohort in China who is involved in either criminal law or public safety violations is significantly small. While initially concerned about not having the original data, the collection of a second cohort using different people yet checking both official and neighborhood-based records, validates the low rate of crime in China. Even with small number of variables available for analysis, some factors can 0 be associated with offending: o Mobility not associated with educational or employment opportunities. o Lower education and occupational status. Even though the district can be seen as, have a generally higher level of education and education than some other sections of Wuhan, lower SES is associated with offending. o While the vast majority of Chinese do not identify themselves as having a religious affiliation, those who do profess some philosophical belief have a lower likeliholod in being delinquent/criminal. o The use of the Disadvantage Index is a usefsll tcoi in differentiating between offenders and non-offenders despite the very small number of offenders. This finding is compatible with notion that Chinese only 105 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.register most serious offenders. Normally one would not expect such variance, but the offending group, itself, is very distinctive and is reflected in Factors and the differences that emerged. Summary and Conclusions This project was initiated to locate the original birth cohort data collected by Marvin Wolfgang and the Chinese Team in 1991, to subject those data to analysis, and to follow the original cohort to age 27. The project became more difficult and more involved than initially envisioned, Data on the original cohort were never collected, only information on those identified as offenders and a matched sample by gender. These two groups, however, had been given a comprehensive survey. The data were never coded or computerized, but we were able to locate the original surveys and to perform analysis on them. Since data were never collected on all of the original 5,340 in the Wuhan 1973 cohort, we initiated a new review of the census, police and neighborhood files to identify those born in 1973 and to track their criminal involvement until the age of 27. For logistic reasons the information gathered in 2000 on those born in 1973 and lived in Wuhan was incomplete relative to the census released in China in 2001. The result was a sample cohort of between 85 and 90 percent of the actual population. The data used for analysis, then, was a small data set of the original 81 offenders and the matched set of 81 non-offenders. A second set of data, the large data set that we defined as Cohort2, included 5,338 persons. Collecting a totally independent cohort population from the same census and police files as the original was actually fortuitous in that it enabled us to e 106 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.check the reliability and validity of the original data collection - a question often in the minds a of western scholars who distrust official statistics. From the analysis of both data sets, we can draw a number of primary conclusions. From the analysis of the survey of offenders and non-offenders, we conclude that: The differences between offenders and non-offenders are significant in terms of peer influences, family background and influences, and the role of school performance, expectations and goals. Offenders are more likely to have negative peer influence, pooler Zamily ba&gounda dild reislrionshipa, and LO have completed lower levels of education and have lower levels of educational expectations. 0 Social integration and involvement iin social and cultural activities related to culture and history distinguish non-offenders from offenders while offenders have a greater commitment to individual wealth, power, influence and enjoyment. Consistent with research from the West and with control theory assumptions, non- offenders are more likely to express traditional social values, morals, and to have personal expectations reflecting greatler social integration, achievement, cultural awareness. The non-offending population in China has greater social awareness and a greater orientation toward social conscience and Chinese society than offenders do. These findings are consistent with the general findings found in the Western literature on the etiology of crime and delinquency. WMe the study was not designed to test and specific theoretical perspective, the significant differences between offenders and non-offenders lend support to propositions consistent with differential association, , 107 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.control theory, and social integration models. Data from the large data set reinforce these variables by the emergence of social stability, social mobility, and philosophical (religious) identification. 0 From the analysis of our Cohort2, we feel that we have validated to original finding of a low rate of delinquency and crime in China, or at least in Wuhan. We have done this not only with the officially registered crime, as is what is officially reported, but also from the local, neighborhood files of public safety violations, whicL 03en do not rza~hl the ofli~iai awistica. Gfficlal Iepons from China look only at crime. Even when we combine both crimes and public safety, the crime rate is low. 0 Our data tend to support, or at least be consistent with, the way the criminal justice system is reported to function in China. The Chinese focus is on prevention, early intervention, and informal processing in the initial stages of criminal behavior (Ren, 1996). The system is also noted for being very hard on offenders once they engage in criminal violations and severe sanctions tend to be applied - contributing perhaps to the low rate of recidivism we found in our research. We did not find, however, harsh penalties applied to our offending population. With so few of those initially recorded as having violated public safety regulations \"graduating \" to or involved in criminai violations, it suggests that the informal and community handling of the problems work in China. 0 Since China handles many of its cases informally, when one is officially identified as an offender, the individual is very distinct. It is just the rarity of offending and \\ the uniqueness of the offenders that lead us to believe that the Disadvantage Index 9 108 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice. This report has not been published by the Department. Opinions or points of view expressed are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the official position or policies of the U.S. Department of Justice.we have developed can, differentiate, in effect, between the very small number of offenders and the significantly large number of non-offenders in the cohort. We have not been able to identify what Wolfgang et a1 (1973) defined as the chronic offender. For whatever reasons - informal, community intervention or 0 severe sanctions, we found very fkw repeat offenders, let alone, \"chronic\" offenders. Other longitudinal research actually had the same difficulty. In the first Philadelphia study, the chronic offender was defined as one having five or more coiithcts with the police by ag;t: I8 (Wcjlfgaiig ;t:t ai., 1972). When the siridy was replicated in Puerto Rico (Nevares et al., 1990), the researchers could not identify a group with five or more contacts and re-defined chronic offender to mean 3 contacts. For our research in China, the closest we could come to a \"chronic\" offender would be a repeat offender, which, in essence, challenges to applicability of the concept as Weitekamp et al. (1995, 1996) did in their reanalysis of the 1945 Philadelphia cohort and the criminal policy based on the chronic offender concept (Weitekamp, 1998,1999). In 1991, registration requirements were relaxed to allow greater mobility of labor within the context of economic reforni. We found higher mobility after 1991 and new forms of criminal behavior such as drug use and drug trafficking. There was also an increase in criminal behavior by those without delinquent records - comparable to the rate found in the West. Nonetheless, the rate of recorded criminal and public safety violations is low Overall, we believe that this research is unique and it is valuable. It is unique because it is the first time in our knowledge that a cohort study has been completed in e ? 109 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.

It is definitely the first time such a study has been done in a Socialist/Communist economic system undergoing rapid social change. The study is valuable because it reinforces the findings from the vast majority of previous literature on crime and delinquency: There is identifiable and critical sociological variables related to social integration, family and school experiences that significantly differentiate between those who become offenders and those who do not. We beBiwe that are social integration, moral. value, cultural values, cultural pride, early community involvement, and family orientation. 110 This document is a research report submitted to the U.S. Department of Justice.
