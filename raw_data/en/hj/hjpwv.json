Substituting Another Benzo Substituting a different type of benzo to safely replicate the benzo high is recommended for patients who are addicted to fast-acting benzos. Substituting slow acting benzos for fast acting benzos reduces the symptoms of withdrawal. This works because of the slower release they have.
