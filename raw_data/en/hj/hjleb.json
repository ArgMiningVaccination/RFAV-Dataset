That's because we must coordinate any other coverage you have with your benefits under our plan. This is called Coordination of Benefits . Once each year, we will send you a letter that lists any other medical or drug insurance coverage that we know about. Please read over this information carefully. If it is correct, you don't need to do anything. If the information is incorrect, or if you have other coverage that is not listed, please call Member Services. You may need to give your plan member ID number to your other insurers (once you have confirmed their identity) so your bills are paid correctly and on time. When you have other insurance (like employer group health coverage), t here are rules set by Medicare that decide whether our plan or your other insurance pays first. The insurance that pays first is called the \"primary payer\" and pays up to the limits of its coverage. The one that pays second, called the \"secondary payer,\" o nly pays if there are costs left uncovered by the primary coverage. The secondary payer may not pay all of the uncovered costs. If you have other insurance, tell your doctor, hospital, and pharmacy. These rules apply for employer or union group health pla n coverage: If you have retiree coverage, Medicare pays first. If your group health plan coverage is based on your or a family member's current employment, who pays first depends on your age, the number of people employed by your employer, and whether you have Medicare based on age, disability, or End- Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): o If you're under 65 and disabled and you or your family member is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 100 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 100 employees. o If you're over 65 and you or your spouse is still working, your group health plan pays first if the employer has 20 or more employees or at least one employer in a multiple employer plan that has more than 20 employees. If you have Medicare because of ESRD, your group health plan will pay first for the first 30 months after you become eligible for Medicare. These types of coverage usually pay first for services related to each type: No-fault insurance (including automobile insurance) Liability (including automobile insurance) Black lung benefits 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 13 Chapter 1 Getting started as a member Workers' compensation Medicaid and TRICARE never pay first for Medicare -covered services. They only pay after Medicare, employer group health plans, and/or Medigap have paid.

CHAPTER 3 : Using the plan for your medical services 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 29 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services SECTION 1 Things to know about getting your medical care as a member of our plan This chapter explains what you need to know about using the plan to get your medical care covered. It gives definitions of terms and explains the rules you will need to follow to get the medical treatments, services, equipment, Part B prescription drugs, and other medical care that are covered by the plan. For the details on what medical care is covered by our plan and how much you pay when you get this care, use the benefits chart in the next chapter, Chap ter 4 ( Medical Benefits Chart, what is covered and what you pay ). Section 1.1 What are \"network providers\" and \"covered services\"? \"Providers\" are doctors and other health care professionals licensed by the state to provide medical services and care. The term \"providers\" also includes hospitals and other health care facilities. \"Network providers\" are the doctors and other health care professionals, medical groups, hospitals, and other health care facilities that have an agreement with us to accept our pa yment and your cost -sharing amount as payment in full. We have arranged for these providers to deliver covered services to members in our plan. The providers in our network bill us directly for care they give you. When you see a network provider, you pay only your share of the cost for their services. \"Covered services\" include all the medical care, health care services, supplies, and equipment that are covered by our plan. Your covered services for medical care are listed in the benefits chart in Chapter 4. Section 1.2 Basic rules for getting your medical care covered by the plan As a Medicare health plan, Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) must cover all services covered by Original Medicare and must follow Original Medicare's coverage rules. Geisinger Gold H eritage (HMO) will generally cover your medical care as long as: The care you receive is included in the plan's Medical Benefits Chart (this chart is in Chapter 4 of this document ). The care you receive is considered medically necessary . \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, equipment, or Part B drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You have a network primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. As a member of our plan, you must choose a network PCP (for more information about this, see Section 2.1 in this chapter). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 30 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services You must receive your care from a network provider (for more information about this, see Section 2 i n this chapter). In most cases, care you receive from an out -of- network provider (a provider who is not part of our plan's network) will not be covered. This means that you will have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished. Here are three exceptions: The plan covers emergency or urgently needed services that you get from an out - of-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed services means, see Section 3 in this chapter. If you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover but there are no specialists in our network that provide this care, you can get this care from an out - of-network provider at the same cost sharing you normally pay in- network. Authorization must be obtained from our plan prior to seeking care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider. For information a bout getting approval to see an out -of- network doctor, see Section 2.3 in this chapter. The plan covers kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare -certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area or when your pr ovider for this service is temporarily unavailable or inaccessible . The cost sharing you pay the plan for dialysis can never exceed the cost sharing in Original Medicare. If you are outside the plan's service area and obtain the dialysis from a provider that is outside the plan's network, your cost sharing cannot exceed the cost sharing you pay in- network. However, if your usual in- network provider for dialysis is temporarily unavailable and you choose to obtain services inside the service area from a provi der outside the plan's network the cost sharing for the dialysis may be higher . SECTION 2 Use providers in the plan's network to get your medical care Section 2.1 You must choose a Primary Care Provider (PCP) to provide and oversee your medical care What is a \"PCP\" and what does the PCP do for you? When you become a member of our plan, you must choose a network provider to be your Primary Care Provider (PCP). Your PCP is a physician who meets state requirements and is trained to give you routine medic al care. You will get your routine or basic care from your PCP. Your PCP will also coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. Your PCP will provide most of your care and will help you arrange or coordinate the rest of the covered services you get as a member of our plan. This includes x- rays, laboratory tests, therapies, care from doctors who are specialists, hospital admissions, and follow -up care. \"Coordinating\" your services includes checking or consulting with other net work providers about your care and how your care is progressing. In some cases, your PCP will need to get prior 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 31 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services authorization (prior approval) from us. Since your PCP will provide and coordinate your medical care, you should have all of your past medical r ecords sent to your PCP's office. Chapter 6 Section 1.4 tells you how we will protect the privacy of your medical records and personal health information. How do you choose your PCP? Upon enrollment, you can choose a PCP by selecting a PCP listed in the Pr ovider Directory or by obtaining assistance from Member Services. Changing your PCP You may change your PCP for any reason, at any time. Also, it's possible that your PCP might leave our plan's network of providers and you would have to find a new PCP. To change your PCP, call Member Services. When you call, be sure to tell Member Services if you are seeing specialists or getting other covered services that needed your PCP's approval (such as home health services , or durable medical equipment (DME) or podiatry routine foot care services ). Member Services will help make sure that you can continue with the specialty care and other services you have been getting when you change your PCP. They will also check to be sure the PCP you want to switch to is accepting new patients. Member Services will change your membership record to show the name of your new PCP and tell you when the change to your new PCP will take effect. They will send you a new membership card that shows your new PCP office unless the ch ange of your PCP is within the same primary care office. Section 2. 2 How to get care from specialists and other network providers A specialist is a doctor who provides health care services for a specific disease or part of the body. There are many kinds of specialists. Here are a few examples: Oncologists care for patients with cancer. Cardiologists care for patients with heart conditions. Orthopedists care for patients with certain bone, joint, or muscle conditions. When your PCP thinks that you need speci alized treatment, he/she will recommend that you see a plan specialist or certain other providers. Your PCP will help you arrange or coordinate covered services you get from other plan providers. For some types of services and care, your provider may need to get approval in advance from our plan (this is called \"prior authorization\"). Services that need prior authorization are identified in the Benefits Chart in Chapter 4, Section 2.1 by statements in bold italics . You are responsible for making sure that your provider has obtained prior authorization from the plan before you receive any care or services that require it. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 32 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What if a specialist or another network provider leaves our plan? It is important that you know that we may make changes to the hospitals, doctors and specialists (providers) that are part of your plan during the year. If your doctor or specialist leave s your plan you have certain rights and protections summarized below: Even though our network of providers may change during the year, Medicar e requires that we furnish you with uninterrupted access to qualified doctors and specialists. We will make a good faith effort to provide you with at least 30 days' notice that your provider is leaving our plan so that you have time to select a new provider. We will assist you in selecting a new qualified provider to continue managing your health care needs. If you are undergoing medical treatment , we will work with you to ensure, that the medically necessary treatment you are receiving is not interrupted . If our network does not have a qualified specialist for a plan- covered service, we must cover that service at in -network cost sharing. Authorization must be obtained from the plan prior to seeking this type of out -of-network care. If you find out your doctor or specialist is leaving your plan, please contact us so we can assist you in finding a new provider to manage your care. If you believe we have not furnished you with a qualified provider to replace your previous provider , or that your care is not being appropriately managed, you have the right to file a quality -of-care complaint to the QIO, a quality -of-care grievance to the plan, or both. Please see Chapter 7. Section 2. 3 How to get care from out -of-network providers In certain situations, it may be necessary for you to obtain care outside of the plan's network. You do not need permission from the plan (called prior authorization) to seek out -of-network emergency or urgently needed services, but for all other types of care, you are responsible for making sure that prior authorization has been obtained before you receive out -of-network care. Except for emergency and urgently needed services, we will not pay for out -of-network care you receive without first obtaining prior authorization. To ask for prior authorization, please call the Member Services phone number listed on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card. Our plan covers emergency care or urgently needed services that you obtain from an out - of-network provider. For more information about this, and to see what emergency or urgently needed services means, see Section 3 in this chapter. You do not need prior authorization to seek emergency or urgently needed services out -of-network. If you get emergency or urgently needed services out -of-network, your cost is the same cost you would pay in- network for the same service. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 33 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services If you need medical care that Medicare requires our plan to cover and an in -network provider cannot provide this care, you can get this care from an out -of-network provider. Authorization must be obtained from the plan prior to seeking this type of out -of- network care. In this situation, you will pay the same as you would pay if you got the care from a network provider. Kidney dialysis services that you get at a Medicare- certified dialysis facility when you are temporarily outside the plan's service area. Routine and Medicare -covered eyewear (prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses) benefits may be obtained out of network. Prior authorization to go out of network for eyewear is not necessary. Supplemental dental benefits, up to your plan's allowed benefit maximum, can be provided by a participating provider OR any licensed dentist. For more information, see your new 2023 member ID card or contact Membe r Services. SECTION 3 How to get services when you have an emergency or urgent need for care or during a disaster Section 3.1 Getting care if you have a medical emergency What is a \"medical emergency\" and what should you do if you have one? A \"medical emergency\" is when you, or any other prudent layperson with an average knowledge of health and medicine, believe that you have medical symptoms that require immediate medical attention to prevent your loss of life (and, if you are a pregnant woman, loss of an unborn child), loss of a limb or function of a limb, or loss of or serious impairment to a bodily function. The medical symptoms may be an illness, injury, severe pain, or a medical condition that is quickly getting worse. If you have a medical emergency: Get help as quickly as possible. Call 911 for help or go to the nearest emergency room or hospital. Call for an ambulance if you need it. You do not need to get approval first from your PCP. You do not need to use a network doctor. You may get covered emer gency medical care whenever you need it, anywhere in the United States or its territories , and from any provider with an appropriate state license even if they are not part of our network As soon as possible, make sure that our plan has been told about you r emergency. We need to follow up on your emergency care. You or someone else should call to tell us about your emergency care, usually within 48 hours. The number to call is on the back of your Geisinger Gold membership card. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 34 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What is covered if you have a medical emergency? Our plan covers ambulance services in situations where getting to the emergency room in any other way could endanger your health. We also cover medical services during the emergency. The doctors who are giving you emergency care w ill decide when your condition is stable and the medical emergency is over. After the emergency is over you are entitled to follow -up care to be sure your condition continues to be stable. Your doctors will continue to treat you until your doctors contact us and make plans for additional care. Your follow -up care will be covered by our plan. If your emergency care is provided by out -of-network providers, we will try to arrange for network pr oviders to take over your care as soon as your medical condition and the circumstances allow. What if it wasn't a medical emergency? Sometimes it can be hard to know if you have a medical emergency. For example, you might go in for emergency care - thinking that your health is in serious danger - and the doctor may say that it wasn't a medical emergency after all. If it turns out that it was not an emergency, as long as you reasonably thought your health was in serious danger, we will cover your care. Howe ver, after the doctor has said that it was not an emergency, we will cover additional care only if you get the additional care in one of these two ways: You go to a network provider to get the additional care . - or - The additional care you get is conside red \"urgently needed services \" and you follow the rules for getting this urgent care (for more information about this, see Section 3.2 below). Section 3.2 Getting care when you have an urgent need for services What are \"urgently needed services\"? An \" urgently needed service\" is a non- emergency, unforeseen medical illness, injury, or condition that requires immediate medical care . For example, an unforeseen flare- up of a known condition that you have or a severe sore throat that occurs over the weekend. Urge ntly needed services may be furnished by out -of-network providers when it is unreasonable, given your circumstances, to obtain immediate care from network providers . If you are in the plan's service area and have an urgent need for services, you should contact your PCP's office first, if possible. Many primary care providers reserve some time each day to see patients with an urgent need for services. Even after hours, your PCP may be able to assist you, 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 35 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services or may be able to direct you to a partnering in- networ k provider who is on call for urgent after - hours services. You may also call our 24- hour nurse line, Tel -a-nurse, for assistance at 877- 543- 5061. If your PCP and other network providers are unavailable or inaccessible, our plan will cover urgently needed s ervices that you receive at an urgent care center or from an out -of- network provider. Our plan covers worldwide emergency and urgent care services outside the United States under the following circumstances . If an urgent need for medical services occurs while you are traveling outside the United States, your Geisinger Gold Worldwide Emergency/Urgent Coverage benefit will cover urgently needed services you receive outside of the United States and its territories. Coverage is limited to services that would be classified as urgently needed services had you received them inside the United States, up to a combined Worldwide Emergency/Urgent Coverage benefit limit of $100,000 per year. Our plan does not cover non -emergency/non- urgent services if you recei ve the care outside of the United States . For more information, please see the Worldwide emergency/urgent coverage section of the Benefit Chart in Chapter 4 or contact Member Services. Section 3.3 Getting care during a disaster If the Governor of your stat e, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, or the President of the United States declares a state of disaster or emergency in your geographic area, you are still entitled to care from your plan. Please visit the following website: www.GeisingerGol d.com for information on how to obtain needed care during a disaster . If you cannot use a network provider during a disaster, your plan will allow you to obtain care from out -of-network providers at in- network cost sharing. SECTION 4 What if you are billed directly for the full cost of your services? Section 4.1 You can ask us to pay our share of the cost of covered services If you have paid more than your plan cost -sharing for covered services, or if you have received a bill for the full cost of cove red medical services, go to Chapter 5 ( Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services ) for information about what to do. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 36 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Section 4.2 If services are not covered by our plan, you must pay the full cost Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) covers all medically necessary services as listed in the Medical Benefits Chart in Chapter 4 of this document. If you receive services not covered by our plan or services obtained out -of-network and were not authorized, you are responsi ble for paying the full cost of services . For covered services that have a benefit limitation, you also pay the full cost of any services you get after you have used up your benefit for that type of covered service . Costs you have paid once a benefit limi t has been reached will not count toward your out -of-pocket maximum. SECTION 5 How are your medical services covered when you are in a \"clinical research study\"? Section 5.1 What is a \"clinical research study\"? A clinical research study (also called a \"cli nical trial\") is a way that doctors and scientists test new types of medical care, like how well a new cancer drug works. Certain clinical research studies are approved by Medicare. Clinical research studies approved by Medicare typically request volunteer s to participate in the study. Once Medicare approves the study, and you express interest, someone who works on the study will contact you to explain more about the study and see if you meet the requirements set by the scientists who are running the study. You can participate in the study as long as you meet the requirements for the study and you have a full understanding and acceptance of what is involved if you participate in the study. If you participate in a Medicare -approved study, Original Medicare pays most of the costs for the covered services you receive as part of the study. If you tell us that you are in a qualified clinical trial, then you are only responsible for the in- network cost sharing for the services in that trial. If you paid more, for example, if you already paid the Original Medicare cost -sharing amount, we will reimburse the difference between what you paid and the in- network cost sharing. However, you will need to provide documentation to show us how much you paid. When you are in a clinical research study, you may stay enrolled in our plan and continue to get the rest of your care (the care that is not related to the study) through our plan. If you want to participate in any Medicare -approved clinical research study, you do not need to tell us or to get approval from us or your PCP. The providers that deliver your care as part of the clinical research study do not need to be part of our plan's network of providers. Although you do not need to get our plan's permission to be in a clinical research study, we encourage you to notify us in advance when you choose to participate in Medicare- qualified clinical trials . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 37 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services If you participate in a study that Medicare has not approved, you will be responsible for paying all costs for your partici pation in the study . Section 5.2 When you participate in a clinical research study, who pays for what? Once you join a Medicare -approved clinical research study, Original Medicare covers the routine items and services you receive as part of the study, incl uding: Room and board for a hospital stay that Medicare would pay for even if you weren't in a study. An operation or other medical procedure if it is part of the research study. Treatment of side effects and complications of the new care. After Medicare has paid its share of the cost for these services, our plan will pay the difference between the cost sharing in Original Medicare and your in- network cost sharing as a member of our plan. This means you will pay the same amount for the servi ces you receive as part of the study as you would if you received these services from our plan. However, you are required to submit documentation showing how much cost sharing you paid. Please see Chapter 5 for more information for submitting requests for payments. Here's an example of how the cost sharing works: Let's say that you have a lab test that costs $100 as part of the research study. Let's also say that your share of the costs for this test is $20 under Original Medicare, but the test would be $10 under our plan's benefits. In this case, Original Medicare would pay $80 for the test and you would pay the $20 copay required under Original Medicare. You would then notify your plan that you received a qualified clinical trial service and submit documentation such as a provider bill to the plan. The plan would then directly pay you $10. Therefore, your net payment is $10, the same amount you would pay under our plan's benefits. Please note that in order to receive payment from your plan, you must submit documentation to your plan such as a provider bill. When you are part of a clinical research study, neither Medicare nor our plan will pay for any of the following: Generally, Medicare will not pay for the new item or service that the study is testing unless Medicare would cover the item or service even if you wer e not in a study. Items or services provided only to collect data, and not used in your direct health care. For example, Medicare would not pay for monthly CT scans done as part of the study if your medical condition would normally require only one CT scan. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 38 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services Do you want to know more?

TTY users should call 1- 877-486-2048. SECTION 6 Rules for getting care in a \"religious non -medical health care institution\" Section 6.1 What is a religious non- medical health care institution? A religious non- medical health care institution is a facility that provides care for a condition that would ordinarily be treated in a hospital or skilled nursing facility. If getting care in a hospital or a skilled nursing facility is against a member's religious beliefs, we will inste ad provide coverage for care in a religious non- medical health care institution. This benefit is provided only for Part A inpatient services (non- medical health care services). Section 6.2 Receiving Care f rom a Religious Non- Medical Health Care Institution To get care from a religious non- medical health care institution, you must sign a legal document that says you are conscientiously opposed to getting medical treatment that is \"non- excepted.\" \"Non -excepted\" medical care or treatment is any medical care or treatment that is voluntary and not required by any federal, state, or local law. \"Excepted\" medical treatment is medical care or treatment that you get that is not voluntary or is required under federal, state, or local law. To be covered by our plan, t he care you get from a religious non- medical health care institution must meet the following conditions: The facility providing the care must be certified by Medicare. Our plan's coverage of services you receive is limited to non- religious aspects of care. If you get services from this institution that are provided to you in a facility, the following conditions apply: You must have a medical condition that would allow you to receive covered services for inpatient hospital care or skilled nursing facility ca re; 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 39 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services - and - Y ou must get approval in advance from our plan before you are admitted to the facility or your stay will not be covered. Original Medicare inpatient hospital coverage limits apply. For more information about our plan's coverage of services, ple ase see the Benefit Chart in Chapter 4. SECTION 7 Rules for ownership of durable medical equipment Section 7.1 Will you own the durable medical equipment after making a certain number of payments under our plan? Durable medical equipment (DME) includes items such as oxygen equipment and supplies, wheelchairs, walkers, powered mattress systems, crutches, diabetic supplies, speech generating devices, IV infusion pumps, nebulizers, and hospital beds ordered by a prov ider for use in the home. The member always owns certain items, such as prosthetics. In this section, we discuss other types of DME that you must rent. In Original Medicare, people who rent certain types of DME own the equipment after paying copayment s for the item for 13 months. As a member of Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) , however, you usually will not acquire ownership of rented DME items no matter how many copayments you make for the item while a member of our plan, even if you made up to 12 consecutive payments for the DME item under Original Medicare before you joined our plan. Under certain limited circumstances we will transfer ownership of the DME item to you. Call member services for more information. There are certain types of DME that are not eligible for conversion from rental to member ownership, including but not limited to: oxygen, ventilators and power mobility. Before converting an equipment rental to member ownership, we may need documentation from your provider stating that you cont inue to use the equipment and that it is still medically necessary. For more information about rent to own DME and which network DME suppliers offer a rent to own option, please call Member Services. If you choose a DME supplier who does the rent to own option, after the rental period is over and you become the owner, you may be responsible for part of the cost to have the equipment serviced. Please note that accessories and supplies used on, in, or with the DME item are not included in the 13- month rental payment cap. You continue to be responsible for cost sharing on these associated items and supplies purchased for you. 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 40 Chapter 3 Using the plan for your medical services What happens to payments you made for durable medical equipment if you switch to Original Medicare? If you did not acquire ownership of t he DME item while in our plan, you will have to make 13 new consecutive payments after you switch to Original Medicare in order to own the item. The payments made while enrolled in our plan do not count. Example 1: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payment s for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan. The payments you made in Original Medicare do not count. Example 2: You made 12 or fewer consecutive payments for the item in Original Medicare and then joined our plan. You were in our plan but did not obtain ownership while in our plan. You then go back to Original Medicare. You will have to make 13 consecutive new payments to own the item once you join Original Medicare again. All previous payments (whether to our plan or to Original Medicar e) do not count. Section 7.2 Rules for oxygen equipment, supplies, and maintenance What oxygen benefits are you entitled to? If you qualify for Medicare oxygen equipment coverage, Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) will cover: Rental of oxygen equipment Deliv ery of oxygen and oxygen contents Tubing and related oxygen accessories for the delivery of oxygen and oxygen contents Maintenance and repairs of oxygen equipment If you leave Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) or no longer medically require oxygen equipment, then the oxygen equipment must be returned. What happens if you leave our plan and return to Original Medicare? Original Medicare requires an oxygen supplier to provide you services for five years. During the first 36 months you rent the equipment. The remaining 24 months the supplier provides the equipment and maintenance (you are still responsible for the cost sharing for oxygen). After five years , you may choose to stay with the same company or go to another company. At this point, the five -year cycle begins again, even if you remain with the same company, requiring you to pay co st sharing for the first 36 months. If you join or leave our plan, the five -year cycle starts over. CHAPTER 4 : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 42 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) SECTION 1 Understanding your out-of-pocket costs for covered services This chapter provides a Medical Benefits Chart that list s your covered services and shows how much you will pay for each covered service as a member of Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) . Later in this chapter, you can f ind information about medical services that are not covered. It also explains limits on certain services. Section 1.1 Types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services To understand the payment information, we give you in this chapter, you need to know about the types of out -of-pocket costs you may pay for your covered services : A \"copayment\" is a fixed amount you pay each time you receive certain medical services. You pay a copayment at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your copayments.) \"Coinsurance\" is a percentage you pay of the total cost of certain medical services. You pay a coinsurance at the time you get the medical service. (The Medical Benefits Chart in Section 2 tells you more about your coinsurance.) Most people who qualify for Medicaid or for t he Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) program should never pay deductibles, copayments or coinsurance. Be sure to show your proof of Medicaid or QMB eligibility to your provider , if applicable . Section 1. 2 What is the most you will pay for Medicare Part A and Part B covered medical services? Because you are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan, there is a limit on the amount you have to pay out -of-pocket each year for in -network med ical services that are covered under Medicare Part A and Part B. This limit is called the maximum out- of-pocket (MOOP ) amount for medical services. For calendar year 2023 this amount is $6,700. The amounts you pay for copayments and coinsurance for in -network covered services count toward this maximum out -of-pocket amount . In addition, amounts you pay for some services do not count toward your maximum out -of-pocket amount. These services are marked with an asterisk in the Medical Benefits Chart. If you reach the maximum out -of-pocket amount of $6,700, you will not have to pay any out -of-pocket costs for the rest of the year for in -network covered Part A and Part B services. However, you must continue to pay the Medicare Part B premium ( unless your Part B premium is paid for you by Medicaid or another third party) . 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 43 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) Section 1. 3 Our plan also limits your out -of-pocket costs for certain types of services In addition to the maximum out -of-pocket amount for covered Part A and Part B services (see Section 1.2 above), we also have a separate maximum out -of-pocket amount that applies only to certain types of services. The plan has a maximum out -of-pocket amount of $750 for Inpatient Hospital Care . Once you have paid $750 out -of-pocket for Inpatient Hospital Care , the plan will cover these services at no cost t o you for the rest of the calendar year. Both the maximum out -of-pocket amount for Part A and Part B medical services and the maximum out -of-pocket amount for Inpatient Hospital Care apply to your covered Inpatient Hospital Care . This means that once you h ave paid either $6,700 for Part A and Part B medical services or $750 for your Inpatient Hospital Care , the plan will cover your Inpatient Hospital Care at no cost to you for the rest of the year. The benefits chart in Section 2 shows the service category out -of-pocket maximums. The plan has a maximum out -of-pocket amount of $750 for Inpatient Services in a Psychiatric Hospital . Once you have paid $750 out -of-pocket for Inpatient Services in a Psychiatric Hospital , the plan wil l cover these services at no cost to you for the rest of the calendar year. Both the maximum out -of-pocket amount for Part A and Part B medical services and the maximum out - of-pocket amount for Inpatient Services in a Psychiatric Hospital apply to your covered Inpatient Services in a Psychiatric Hospital . This means that once you have paid either $6,700 for Part A and Part B medical services or $750 for your Inpatient Services in a Psychiatric Hospital, the plan will cover your Inpatient Services in a Psych iatric Hospital at no cost to you for the rest of the year. The benefits chart in Section 2 shows the service category out -of-pocket maximums. Section 1. 4 Our plan does not allow providers to \"balance bill\" you As a member of Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) , an important protection for you is that you only have to pay your cost-sharing amount when you get services covered by our plan. Providers may not add additional separate charges , called \"balance billing.\" This protection applies even if we pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Here is how this protection works : If your cost sharing is a copayment (a set amount of dollars, for example, $15.00), then you pay only that amount for any covered services from a network provider. If your cost sharing is a coinsurance (a percentage of the total charges), then you never pay more than that percentage. However, your cost depends on which type of provider you see: If you receive the covered services from a network provider, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the plan's reimbursement rate (as determined in the contract between the provider and the plan). 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 44 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who participates with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for participating providers. (Remember, the plan covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get an authorization from the plan, or for emergencies or urgently needed services .) If you receive the covered services from an out -of-network provider who does not participate with Medicare, you pay the coinsurance percentage multiplied by the Medicare payment rate for non -participating providers. (Remember, the plan covers services from out -of-network providers only in certain situations, such as when you get an authorization from the plan, or for emergencies or urgently needed services .) If you believe a provider has \"balance billed\" you, call Member Services . SECTION 2 Use the Medical Benefits Chart to find out what is covered and how much you will pay Section 2.1 Your medical benefits and costs as a member of the plan The Medical Benefits Chart on the following pages lists the services Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) covers and what you pay out -of-pocket for each service. The services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only when the following coverage requirements are met: Your Medicare covered services must be provided according to the coverage guidelines established by Medicare. Your services (including medical care, services, supplies, equipment , and Part B prescription drugs ) must be medically necessary. \"Medically necessary\" means that the services, supplies, or drugs are needed for the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of your medical condition and meet accepted standards of medical practice. You receive your care from a network provider. In most cases, care you receive from an out -of-network provider will not be covered unless it is emergent or urgent care. This means that you will have to pay the provider in full for the services furnished. You have a primary care provider (a PCP) who is providing and overseeing your care. Some of the services listed in the Medical Benefits Chart are covered only if your doctor or other network provider gets approval in advance (sometimes called \"prior authorization\") from us. Covered services that need approval in adva nce are marked in the Medical Benefits Chart in bold italics . In addition, the following services not listed in the Benefits Chart require prior authorization: o Biofeedback Training 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 45 Chapter 4 Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay) We may also charge you \"administrative fees\" for missed appointments or for not paying your required cost sharing at the time of service. Call Member Services if you have questions regarding these administrative fees. Other important things to know about our coverage: Like all Medicare health plans, we cover everything that Orig inal Medicare covers. For some of these benefits, you pay more in our plan than you would in Original Medicare. For others, you pay less.

For all preventive services that are covered at no cost under Original Medicare, we also cover the service at no cost to you. However, if you also are treated or monitored for an existing medical condition during the visit when you receive the preventive service, a copayment will apply for the care received for the existing medical condition. If Medicare adds coverage for any new services during 2023, either Medicare or our plan will cover those services.

Send us this bill, along with documentation of any payments you have already made. o If the provider is owed anything, we will pay the provider directly. o If you have already paid more than your share of the cost of the service, we will determine how much you owed and pay you back for our share of the cost. 2. When a network provider sends you a bill you think you should not pay Network providers should always bill the plan directly and ask you only for your share of the cost. But sometimes they make mistakes and ask you to pay more than your share. You only have to pay your cost -sharing amount when you get covered services. We do not allow providers to add additional separate charges, called \"balance billing.\" This protection (that you never pay more than your cost -sharing a mount) applies even if we 2023 Evidence of Coverage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 90 Chapter 5 Asking us to pay our share of a bill you have received for covered medical services pay the provider less than the provider charges for a service and even if there is a dispute and we don't pay certain provider charges. Whenever you get a bill from a network provider that you think is more than you should pay, se nd us the bill. We will contact the provider directly and resolve the billing problem. If you have already paid a bill to a network provider, but you feel that you paid too much, send us the bill along with documentation of any payment you have made and ask us to pay you back the difference between the amount you paid and the amount you owed under the plan. 3. If you are retr oactively enrolled in our plan Sometimes a person's enrollment in the plan is retroactive. ( This means that the first day of their en rollment has already passed . The enrollment date may even have occurred last year.) If you were retroactively enrolled in our plan and you paid out -of-pocket for any of your covered services after your enrollment date, you can ask us to pay you back for our share of the costs. You will need to submit paperwork such as receipts and bills f or us to handle the reimbursement. All of the examples above are types of coverage decisions. This means that if we deny your request for payment, you can appeal our decision. Chapter 7 of this document has information about how to make an appeal. SECTION 2 How to ask us to pay you back or to pay a bill you have received You may request us to pay you back by either calling us or sending us a request in writing.

To make sure you are giving us all the information we need to make a decision, you can fill out our claim form to make your request for payment.

CHAPTER 7 : What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 101 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) SECTION 1 Introduction Section 1.1 What to do if you have a problem or concern This chapter explains two types of processes for handling problems and concerns: For some problems, you need to use the process for coverage decisions and appeals . For other problems, you need to use the process for making complaints ; also called grievances . Both of these processes have been approved by Medicare. E ach process has a set of rules, procedures, and deadlines that must be followed by us and by you. The guide in Section 3 will help you identify the right process to use and what you should do. Section 1.2 What about the legal terms? There are legal terms for some of the rules, procedures, and types of deadlines explained in this chapter. Many of these terms are unfamiliar to most people and can be hard to understand. To make things easier, this chapter : Uses simpler words in place of certain legal terms. For example, this chapter generally says , \"making a complaint\" rather than \"filing a than determination \"independent review organization\" instead of \"Independent Review Entity.\" It also uses abbreviations as little as possible. However, it can be helpful - and sometimes quite important - for you to know the correct legal terms. Knowing which terms to use will help you communicate more accurately to get the right help or information for your situation. To help you know which terms to use, we include legal terms when we give the details for handling specific types of situations. SECTION 2 Where to get more information and personalized assistance We are always available to help you. Even if you have a complaint about our treatment of you, we are obligated to honor your right to complain. Therefore, you should always reach out to customer service for help. But in some situations , you may also want help or guidance from someone who is not connected with us. Below are two entities that can assist you. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 102 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP) Each state has a government program with trained counselors. The program is not connected with us or with any insurance company or health plan. The counselors at this program can help you understand which process you should use to handle a problem you are having. They can also answer your questions, give you more information, and offer guidance on what to do. The services of SHIP counselors are free. You will find phone numbers and website URLs in Chapter 2, Section 3 of this document . Medicare You can also contact Medicare to get help . To contact Medicare: You can call 1 -800-MEDICARE (1 -800-633-4227), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. TTY users should call 1- 877-486-2048. You can also visit the Medicare web site (www.medicare.gov ). SECTION 3 To deal with your problem, which process should you use? If yo u have a problem or concern, you only need to read the parts of this chapter that apply to your situation. The guide that follows will help. Is your problem or concern about your benefits or coverage? (This includes problems about whether medical care or prescription drugs are covered or not, the way they are covered, and problems related to payment for medic al care or prescription drugs.) Yes. Go on to the next section of this chapter, Section 4, \"A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals.\" No. Skip ahead to Section 9 at the end of this chapter: \"How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service or other concerns.\" 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 103 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) COVERAGE DECISIONS AND APPEALS SECTION 4 A guide to the basics of coverage decisions and appeals Section 4.1 Asking for coverage decisions and making appeals: the big picture Coverage decisions and appeals deal with problems related to your benefits and coverage for medical services, including payment. This is the process you use for issues such as whether something is covered or not and the way in which something is covered. Asking for coverage decisions prior to receiving services A coverage decision is a decision we make about your benefits and coverage or about the amount we will pay for your medical services. For example, your plan network doctor makes a (favorable) coverage decision for you whenever you receive medical care from him or her or if your network doctor refers you to a medical specialist. You or your doctor can also contact us and ask for a coverage decision if your doctor is unsure whether we will cover a particular medical service or refuses to provide medical care you think that you need. In other words, if you want to know if we will cover a medical service before you receive it, you can ask us to make a coverage decision for you. In limited circumstances a request for a coverage decision will be dismissed, which means we won't review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf , but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a coverage decision, we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. We are making a coverage decision for you whenever we decide what is covered for you and how much we pay. In some cases, we might decide a service is not covered or is no longer covered by Medicare for you. If you disagree with this coverage decision, you can make an appeal. Making an appeal If we make a coverage decision , whether before or after a service is received, and you are not satisfied, you can \"appeal\" the decision. An appeal is a formal way of asking us to review and change a coverage decision we have made. Under certain circumstances, which we discuss later, you can request an expedited or \"fast appeal \" of a coverage decision. Your appeal is handled by different reviewers than those who made the original decision. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 104 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) When you appeal a decision for the first time, this is called a Level 1 a ppeal. In this appeal, we review the coverage decision we made to check to see if we were properly following the rules. When we have completed the review , we give you our decision. In limited circumstances a request for a Level 1 appeal will be dismissed, which means we won't review the request. Examples of when a request will be dismissed include if the request is incomplete, if someone makes the request on your behalf , but isn't legally authorized to do so or if you ask for your request to be withdrawn. If we dismiss a request for a Level 1 appeal , we will send a notice explaining why the request was dismissed and how to ask for a review of the dismissal. If we do not dismiss your case but say no to all or part of your Level 1 appeal, you can go on to a Level 2 appeal. The Level 2 appeal is conducted by an independent review organization that is not connected to us. (Appeals for medical services and Part B drugs will be automatically sent to the independent review organization for a Level 2 appeal - you do not need to do anything. If you are not satisfied with the decision at the Level 2 appeal, you may be able to continue through additional levels of appeal (Section 8 i n this chapter explains the Level 3, 4, and 5 appeals processes). Section 4.2 How to get help when you are asking for a coverage decision or making an appeal Here are resources if you decide to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision: You can call us at Member Services . You can get free help from your SHIP . Your doctor can make a request for you. If your doctor helps with an appeal past Level 2, they will need to be appointed as your representative. Please call Member Services and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. (The form is also available on Medicare's website at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS -Forms/CMS - Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our website at www.GeisingerGold.com .) For medical care or Part B prescription drugs , your doctor can request a cover age decision or a Level 1 a ppeal on your behalf. If your appeal is denied at Level 1, it will be automatically forwarded to Level 2. You can ask someone to act on your behalf. If you want to, you can name another person to act for you as your \"representative\" to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal. If you want a friend, relative, or an other person to be your representative, call Member Services and ask for the \"Appointment of Representative\" form. (The form is also available on Medicare's web site at www.cms.gov/Medicare/CMS - Forms/CMS -Forms/downloads/cms1696.pdf or on our web site at 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 105 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) www.GeisingerGold.com .) The form gives that person permission to act o n your behalf. It must be signed by you and by the person who you would like to act on your behalf. You must give us a copy of the signed form. While we can accept an appeal request without the form, we cannot begin or complete our review until we receive it. If we do not receive the form within 44 calendar days after receiving your appeal request (our deadline for making a decision on your appeal), your appeal request will be dismissed. If this happens, we will send you a written notice explaining your right to ask the independent review organization to review our decision to dismiss your appeal. You also have the right to hire a lawyer. You may contact your own lawyer or get the name of a lawyer from your local bar association or other referral service. Th ere are also groups that will give you free legal services if you qualify. However, you are not required to hire a lawyer to ask for any kind of coverage decision or appeal a decision. Section 4.3 Which section of this chapter gives the details for your situation? There are three different situations that involve coverage decisions and appeals. Since each situation has different rules and deadlines, we give the details for each one in a separate section: Section 5 of this chapter: \"Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal\" Section 6 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to cover a longer inpatient hospital stay if you think the doctor is discharging you too soon\" Section 7 of this chapter: \"How to ask us to keep covering certain medical services if you think your coverage is ending too soon\" ( Applies to only these services : home health care, skilled nursing facility care, and Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services) If you're not sure which section you should be using, please call Member Services. You can also get h elp or information from government organizations such as your SHIP . 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 106 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) SECTION 5 Your medical care: How to ask for a coverage decision or make an appeal of a coverage decision Section 5.1 This section tells what to do if you have problems getting coverage for medical care or if you want us to pay you back for our share of the cost of your care This section is about your benefits for medical care and services. These benefits are described in Chapter 4 of this document : Medical Benefits Chart (what is covered and what you pay ). To keep things simple, we generally refer to \"medical care coverage\" or \"medical care\" which includes medical items and services as well as Medicare Part B prescription drugs. In some cases, different rules apply to a request for a Part B prescription drug. In those cases, we will explain how the rules for Part B prescription drugs are different from the rules for medical items and services. This section tells what you can do if you are in any of the five following situations: 1. You are not getting certain medical care you want, and you believe that this care is covered by our plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2. 2. Our plan will not approve the medical care your doctor or other medical provider wants to give you, and you beli eve that this care is covered by the plan. Ask for a coverage decision. Section 5.2. 3. You have received medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, but we have said we will not pay for this care. Make an Appeal. Section 5.3. 4. You have received and paid for medical care that you believe should be covered by the plan, and you want to ask our plan to reimburse you for this care. Send us the bill. Section 5.5 5. You are being told that coverage for certain medical care you have been gettin g that we previously approved will be reduced or stopped, and you believe that reducing or stopping this care could harm your health. Make an Appeal. Section 5.3.

Special rules apply to these types of care. Section 5.2 Step -by-step: How to ask for a coverage decision Legal Terms When a coverage decision involves your medical care, it is called an \"organization determination.\" A \"fast coverage decision\" is called an \"expedited determination.\" Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard coverage decision\" or a \"fast coverage decision.\" A \"standard coverage decision\" is usually made within 14 days or 72 hours for Part B drugs . A \"fast coverage decision\" is generally made within 72 hours, for medical services, or 24 hours for Part B drugs. In order to get a fast c overage decision, you must meet two requirements: You may only ask for coverage for medical care you have not yet received . You can get a fast coverage decision only if using the standard deadlines could cause serious harm to your health or hurt your ability to function. If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast coverage decision,\" we will automatically agree to give you a fast coverage decision. If you ask for a fast coverage decision on your own, without your doctor's support, we will decide whether your health requires that we give you a fast coverage decision. If we do not approve a fast coverage decision, we will send you a letter that: Explains that we will use the standard deadlines . Explains if your doctor asks for the fast coverage decision, we will automatically give you a fast coverage decision . Explains that you can file a \"fast complaint\" about our decision to give you a standard coverage decision instead of the fast coverage decision you requested. Step 2: Ask our plan to make a coverage decision or fast coverage decision. Start by calling, wr iting, or faxing our plan to make your request for us to authorize or provide coverage for the medical care you want. You, your doctor, or your representative can do this. Chapter 2 has contact information. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 108 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 3: We consider your request for medical care coverage and give you our answer. For standard coverage decisions , we use the standard deadlines. This means we will give you an answer within 14 calendar days after we receive your request for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug , we will give you an answer within 72 hours after we receive your request. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more days if your request is for a medical item or service. If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days , you can file a \"fast complaint\". We will give you an answer to your complaint as soon as we make the decision . (The process for making a complaint is different from the process for coverage decisions and appeals. See Section 9 of this chapter for informa tion on complaints.) For Fast Coverage decisions , we use an expedited timeframe A fast coverage decision means we will answer within 72 hours if your request is for a medical item or service. If your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug, we will answer within 24 hours. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more days . If we take extra days, we will tell you in writing. We can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If you believe we should not take extra days, you can file a \"fast complaint\". (See Section 9 of this chapter for information on complaints.) We will call you as soon as we make the decision. If our answer is no to part or all of what you requested, we will send you a written statem ent that explains why we said no. Step 4: If we say no to your request for coverage for medical care, you can appeal. If we say no, you have the right to ask us to reconsider this decision by making an appeal. This means asking again to get the medical ca re coverage you want. If you make an appeal, it means you are going on to Level 1 of the appeals process. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 109 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Section 5.3 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 1 appeal Legal Terms An appeal to the plan about a medical care coverage decision is called a plan \"reconsideration.\" A \"fast appeal\" is also called an \"expedited reconsideration.\" Step 1: Decide if you need a \"standard appeal\" or a \"fast appeal.\" A \"standard appeal\" is usually made within 30 days. A \"fast appeal\" is generally made within 72 hours. If you are appealing a decision we made about coverage for care that you have not yet received, you and/or your doctor will need to decide if you need a \"fast appeal.\" If your doctor tells us that your health requires a \"fast appeal,\" we will give you a fast appeal. The requirements for getting a \"fast appeal\" are the same as those for getting a \"fast coverage decision\" in Section 5.2 of this chapter. Step 2: Ask our plan for an Appeal or a Fast Appeal If you are asking for a standard appeal, submit your standard appeal in writing. Chapter 2 has contact information. If you are asking for a fast appeal, make your appeal in writing or call us . Chapter 2 has contact information. You must make your appeal request within 60 calendar days from the date on the written notice we sent to tell you our answer on the coverage decision. If you miss this deadline and have a good reason for missing it, explain the reason your appeal is late when you make your appeal. W e may give you more time to make your appeal. Examples of good cause may include a serious illness that prevented you from contacting us or if we provided you with incorrect or incomplete information about the deadline for requesting an appeal. You can ask for a copy of the information regarding your medical decision . You and your doctor may add more information to support your appeal. Step 3: We consider your appeal and we give you our answer. When our plan is reviewing your appeal, we take a careful look at all of the information. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we said no to your request. We will gather more information if need ed, possibly contacting you or your doctor. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 110 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Deadlines for a \"fast appeal \" 1. For fast appeals, we must give you our answer within 72 hours after we receive your appeal . We will give you our answer sooner if your health requires us to. a. However, if you ask for more time, or if we need more information that may benefit you, we can take up to 14 more calendar days if your request is for a medical item or service .

If our answer is yes to part or all of what you requested, we must authorize or provide the coverage within 30 calendar d ays if your request is for a medical item or service, or within 7 calendar days if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. If our plan says no to part or all of your appeal , we will automatically send your appeal to the i ndependent review organization for a Level 2 appeal . 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 111 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Section 5.4 Step -by-step: How a Level 2 appeal is done Legal Term The formal name for the \" independent review organization \" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" The independent review organization is an independent organization hired by Medicare . It is not connected with us and is not a government agency. This organization decides whether the decision we made is correct or if it should be changed. Medicare oversees it s work.

The i ndependent review or ganization can't take extra time to make a decision if your request is for a Medicare Part B prescription drug. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 112 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 2: The independent review organization gives you their answer. The i ndependent review organization will tell you it's decision in writing a nd explain the reasons for it. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a medical item or service, we must authorize the medical care coverage within 72 hours or provide the service within 14 calendar days after we receive the decision from the review organization for standard requests . For expedited requests, we have 72 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If the review organization says yes to part or all of a request for a Medicare Part B prescription drug , we must authorize or provide the Part B prescription drug within 72 hours after we receive the decision from the review organization for standard requests . For expedited requests, we have 24 hours from the date we receive the decision from the review organization. If this organization says no to part or all of your appeal , it means they agree with us that your request (or part of your request) for coverage for medical care should not be approved. (This is called \"upholding the decision\" or \"turning down your appeal\") . In this case, the i ndependent review organization will send you a letter: Explaining its decision.

Section 5.5 Wha t if you are asking us to pay you for our share of a bill you have received for medical care? Chapter 5 describes when you may need to ask for reimbursement or to pay a bill you have received from a provider. It also tells how to send us the paperwork that asks us for payment. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 113 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Asking for reimbursement is asking for a coverage decision from us If you send us the paperwork asking for reimbursement, you are asking for a coverage decision. To make this decision, we will check to see if the medical care you paid for is a covered service. We will also check to see if you followed all the rules for using your coverage for medical care.

I f you haven't paid for the services, we will send the payment directly to the provider. If we say no to your request : If the medical care is not covered, or you did not follow all the rules, we will not send payment. Instead, we will send you a letter that says we will not pay for the services and the reasons why. If you do not agree with our decision to turn you down, you can make an appeal . If you make an appeal, it means you are asking us to change the coverage decision we made when we turned down your request for payment. To make this appeal, follow the process for appeals that we describe in Section 5.3. For appeals concerning reimbursement, please note: We must give you our answer within 60 calendar days after we receive your appeal.

Before you start, understand what you need t o do and what the deadlines are. Follow the process. Meet the deadlines. Ask for help if you need it . If you have questions or need help at any time, please call Member Services. Or call your S HIP, a government organization that provides personalized ass istance. During a Level 1 appeal , the Quality Improvement Organization reviews your appeal . It decides if the end date for your care is medically appropriate. The Quality Improvement Organization is a group of doctors and other health care experts paid by the Federal government to check on and help improve the quality of care for people with Medicare. This includes reviewing plan decisions about when it's time to stop covering certain kinds of medical care. These experts are not part of our plan. Step 1: Make your Level 1 appeal : contact the Quality Improvement Organization and ask for a fast -track appeal . You must act quickly. How can you contact this organization?

Legal Term \"Detailed Explanation of Non -Coverage.\" Notice that provides details on reasons for ending coverage. What happens during this review? Health professionals at the Quality Improvement Organization (\"the reviewers\") will ask you, or your representative, why you believe coverage for the services should continue. You don't have to prepare anything in writing, but you may do so if you wish. The review organization will also look at your medical information, talk with your doctor, and review information that our plan has given to them. By the end of the day the reviewers tell us of your appeal, you will get the Detailed Explanation of Non -Coverage, from us that explains in detail our reasons for ending our coverage for your services.

If the reviewers say yes to your appeal, then we must keep providing your covered services for as long as it is medically necessary. You will have to keep paying your share of the costs (such as deductibles or copayments, if these apply). T here may be limitations on your covered services. What happens if the reviewers say no? If the reviewers say no, then your coverage will end on the date we have told you. If you decide to keep getting the home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after this date when your coverage ends, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care yourself. Step 4: If the answer to your Level 1 appeal is no, you decide if you want to make another appeal. If reviewers say no to your Level 1 appeal - and you choose to continue getting care after your coverage for the care has ended - then you can make a Level 2 appeal . 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 124 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Section 7.4 Step -by-step: How to make a Level 2 appeal to have our plan cover your care for a longer time During a Level 2 appeal , you ask the Quality Improvement Organization to take another look at the decision on your first appeal.

Step 1: Contact the Quality Improvement Organization again and ask for another review. You must ask for this review within 60 d ays after the day when the Quality Improvement Organization said no to your Level 1 appeal . You can ask for this review only if you continued getting care after the date that your coverage for the care ended.

It will give you the details about how to go on to the next level of appeal, which is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorne y adjudicator . 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 125 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) Step 4: If the answer is no, you will need to decide whether you want to take your appeal further.

If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal , the details on how to do this are in the written notice you get after your Level 2 appeal decision. The Level 3 appeal is handled by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. Section 7.5 What if you miss the deadline for making your Level 1 appeal ? You can appeal to us instead As explained above, you must act quickly to start your Level 1 appeal (within a day or two, at the most). If you miss the deadline for contacting the Quality Improvement O rganization, there is another way to make your appeal. If you use this other way of m aking your appeal, the first two levels of appeal are different. Step -by-Step: How to make a Level 1 Alternate appeal Legal Term A \"fast review\" (or \"fast appeal\") is also called an \"expedited appeal .\" Step 1: Contact us and ask for a \"fast review.\" Ask for a \"fast review .\" This means you are asking us to give you an answer using the \"fast\" deadlines rather than the \"standard\" deadlines. Chapter 2 has contact information. Step 2: We do a \"fast review \" of the de cision we made about when to end coverage for your services. During this review, we take another look at all of the information about your case. We check to see if we were following all the rules when we set the date for ending the plan's coverage for serv ices you were receiving. Step 3: We give you our decision within 72 hours after you ask for a \"fast review\". If we say yes to your appeal, it means we have agreed with you that you need services longer and will keep providing your covered services for as l ong as they are medically necessary. It also means that we have agreed to reimburse you for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 126 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) would end. (You must pay your share of the costs and there may be coverage limitations that apply.) If we say no to your appeal, then your coverage will end on the date we told you and we will not pay any share of the costs after this date . If you continued to get home health care, or skilled nursing facility care, or Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility (CORF) services after the date when we said your coverage would end, then you will have to pay the full cost of this care. Step 4: If we say no to your appeal, your case will automatically go on to the next level o f the appeals process. Legal Term The formal name for the \" independent review organization \" is the \"Independent Review Entity.\" It is sometimes called the \"IRE.\" Step -by-Step: Level 2 Alternate appeal Process During the Level 2 appeal , an independent review organization reviews the decision we made to your \"fast appeal.\" This organization decides whether the decision should be changed. The independent review organization is an independent organization that is hired by Medicare . This organiza tion is not connected with our plan and it is not a government agency. This organization is a company chosen by Medicare to handle the job of being the i ndependent review organization. Medicare oversees its work. Step 1: We automatically forward your case to the i ndependent review organization. We are required to send the information for your Level 2 appeal to the i ndependent review organization within 24 hours of when we tell you that we are saying no to your first appeal. (If you think we are not meeting this deadline or other deadlines, you can make a complaint. Section 9 of this chapter tells how to make a complaint.) Step 2: The independent review organization does a \"fast review\" of your appeal. The reviewers give you an answer within 72 hours. Reviewers at the i ndependent review organization will take a careful look at all of the information related to your appeal. If this organization says yes to your appeal, then we must pay you back for our share of the costs of care you have received since the date when we said your coverage would end. We must also continue to cover the care for as long as it is medically necessary. You must continue to pay your share of the costs. If there are 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 127 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) coverage limitations, these could limit how much we would reimburse or how long we would continue to cover services. If this organization says no to your appeal, it means they agree with the decision our plan made to your first appeal and will not change it. The notice you get from the i ndependent review organization will tell you in writing what you can do if you wish to go on to a Level 3 appeal . Step 3: If the i ndependent review organization says no to your appeal , you choose whether you want to take your appeal further. There are three additional levels of appeal after Level 2, for a total of five levels of appeal. If you want to go on to a Level 3 appeal , the details on how to do this are in the written notice yo u get after your Level 2 appeal decision. A Level 3 appeal is reviewed by an Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator. Section 8 in this chapter tells more about Levels 3, 4, and 5 of the appeals process. SECTION 8 Taking your appeal to Level 3 and beyond Section 8.1 Appeal Levels 3, 4 and 5 for Medical Service Requests This section may be appropriate for you if you have made a Level 1 appeal and a Level 2 appeal , and both of your appeals have been turned down. If the dollar value of the item or me dical service you have appealed meets certain minimum levels, you may be able to go on to additional levels of appeal. If the dollar value is less than the minimum level, you cannot appeal any further. T he written response you receive to your Level 2 appeal will explain how to make a Level 3 appeal . For most situations that involve appeals, the last three levels of appeal work in much the same way. Here is who handles the review of your appeal at each of these levels. Level 3 appeal An Administrative Law Judge or an attorney adjudicator who works for the Federal government will review your appeal and give you an answer. If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says yes to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over . Unlike a decision at a Level 2 appeal , we have the right to appeal a Level 3 decision that is favorable to you. If we decide to appeal, it will go to a Level 4 appeal . 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 128 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) If we decide not to appeal, we must authorize or provide you with the service within 60 calendar days after receiving the Administrative Law J udge's or attorney adjudicator's decision. If we decide to appeal the decision, we will send you a copy of the Level 4 appeal request with any accompanying documents. We may wait for the Level 4 appeal decision before authorizing or providing the service in dispute. If the Administrative Law Judge or attorney adjudicator says no to your appeal, the appeals process may or may not be over. If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your a ppeal, the appeals process is over. If you do not want to accept the decision, you can continue to the next level of the review process. T he notice you get will tell you what to do for a Level 4 appeal . Level 4 appeal The Medicare A ppeal s Council (Council) will review your appeal and give you an answer. The Council is part of the Federal government. If the answer is yes, or if the Council denies our request to review a favorable Level 3 appeal decision, the appeals process may or may not be over. U nlike a decision at Level 2, we have the right to appeal a Level 4 decision that is favorable to you. We will decide whether to appeal this decision to Level 5. If we decide not to appeal the decision, we must authorize or provide you with the service with in 60 calendar days after receiving the Council's decision. If we decide to appeal the decision, we will let you know in writing. If the answer is no or if the Council denies the review request, the appeals process may or may not be over. If you decide to accept this decision that turns down your appeal, the appeals process is over. If you do not want to accept the decision, you m ay be able to continue to the next level of the review process. If the Council says no to your appeal, the notice you get will tell you whether the rules allow you to go on to a Level 5 appeal and how to continue with a Level 5 appeal . Level 5 appeal A judge at the Federal District Court will review your appeal. A judge will review all of the information and decide yes or no to your request. This is a final answer. There are no more appeal levels after the Federal District Court. 2023 Evidence of C overage for Geisinger Gold Heritage (HMO) 129 Chapter 7 What to do if you have a problem or complaint (coverage decisions, appeals, complaints) MAKING COMPLAINTS SECTION 9 How to make a complaint about quality of care, waiting times, customer service, or other concerns Section 9.1 What kinds of problems are handled by the complaint process?
