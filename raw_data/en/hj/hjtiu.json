One of the reasons people with cancer use complementary therapies is because it helps them take an active role in their health and wellbeing. However, it is important to discuss ways to manage any symptoms and side effects with your doctors, rather than self-diagnosing. Some simple ways people can help themselves, without the guidance of a professional, include learning gentle massage or acupressure techniques, adding essential oils to their bath, or meditating. Some people may consider self-prescribing herbs or nutritional supplements. Although this may seem like a cheaper alternative, [it may not be safe](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/safety-of-herbs/). The benefits of seeing a professional complementary therapist are that they: - are qualified in the therapy or medicine you are considering - have an objective view of your case - may be experienced in treating a range of conditions and have treated other people with cancer - are able to liaise with your cancer specialists, as necessary - can prepare a tailor-made treatment plan and dispense remedies based on your individual needs, if they are qualified to do so - can recommend good quality products and how to take them to achieve the desired effect - can help you avoid the health risks of using complementary therapies that may interact with conventional cancer treatment. Many websites sell a range of herbs or nutritional supplements that may be less expensive than those you can buy in Australia. However, [products purchased from overseas are not covered by the same safety and quality regulations that apply to products sold in Australia](https://www.cancercouncil.com.au/cancer-information/living-well/complementary-therapies/safety-concerns/regulation-of-medicines/).
