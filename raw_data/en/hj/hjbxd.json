Across every corner of the far-flung globe, people were enchanted by the idea of crystal healing. These shimmering stones plucked from the earth's most mystical places are used for healing the body, mind, and soul even to this very day. If we trace the timeline right back to the days of Ancient Rome, the Romans often used crystals whether as protective amulets out on the battlefields or as good luck charms to attract abundance and prosperity. The Ancient Greeks also adored the healing touch of crystals and many stones like Amethyst and Turquoise derived their names and their stories from the shores of Ancient Greece. Over in the Pharaoh lands of Egypt, the Ancient Egyptians were also practicing crystal healing with gemstones. Sure, Egyptian royalty loved to adorn their elaborate costumes and jewelry with crystals, but it went beyond the finery of fashion and into deeper shades of spiritual healing. They would even lavish their tombs with gemstones to protect them long into the afterlife. Some Native American cultures also found sacred energy in using crystals to diagnose illnesses. Beyond the borders of Western shores and to the East, the healing powers of crystals were also being stitched into everyday medicinal culture. In Chinese medicine, it's common to see crystals in practices like acupuncture and stone medicine was readily relied upon in both Feng Shui and the body. Old and intricate Japanese culture would also call upon crystals to help with visionary work and spiritual healing, favoring the Clear Quartz for its light bringing grace and beauty. In our modern world, our primal love of crystals hasn't diminished, although we may have lost our close-knit connection with the cosmic properties of these stones. Still, crystals play a huge role in alternative healing therapies thanks to their stable energy patterns and unique frequencies. We use them in chakra healing, for emotional and EMF protection, and to clear stagnant energies and connect deeper with heavens above and the world beneath our feet. Crystals are born of the earth and in their unique makeup, they bring with them the essence of Mother Earth's healing. If you want to ramp up your self-care, this guide is a great place to start.
