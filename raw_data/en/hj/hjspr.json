PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMA RY What is the question? The question is: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during pregnancy and gestational weight gain? What is the answer to the question? Limited evidence suggests that certain dietary patterns during pregnancy are associated with a lower risk of excessive gestational weight gain during pregnancy. These patterns are higher in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish, and lower in added sugar, and red and processed meat. Why was this question asked? This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Health and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. How was this question answered? The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Pregnancy and Lactation Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. Dietary patterns were defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they are habitually consumed. Diets based on macronutrient distribution were examined when at least one macronutrient proportion was outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) for carbohydrate, fat, and/or protein, whether or not the foods/food groups consumed were provided. What is the population of int erest? The population of interest is generally healthy, pregnant women . What evidence was found? This review includes 26 articles published between 2009 and 2019. Many studies showed that \"beneficial\" dietary patterns were related to less weight gain du ring pregnancy . Dietary patterns that were consistently related to less weight gain during pregnancy were: o higher in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish , and o lower in added sugar, red and processed meat . The body of evidence is limited in several ways : o Studies were mostly observational and c ause -effect relationships between diet and weight gain during pregnancy were therefore difficult to determine . 11 o There was little racial/ethnic , socioecono mic, and age diversity in these studies . o It was difficult to comp are studies due to inconsistencies in how diets were measured . o There were concerns abo ut potential bias of the studies . o Many studies were not designed to study the relationship between diet ary patterns and weight gain during p regnancy . How up -to-date is this systematic review? This review searched for studies from January 2000 to November 2019. 12 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background This important public health question was identified by the U.S. Departments of Agriculture (USDA) and Hea lth and Human Services (HHS) to be examined by the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. The 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, Pregnancy and Lactation Subcommittee conducted a systematic review to answer this question with support from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR) team. The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between dietary patterns consu med during pregnancy and gestational weight gain? Conclusion statement and grade Limited evidence suggests that certain dietary patterns during pregnancy are associated with a lower risk of excessive gestational weight gain durin g pregnancy. These patterns are higher in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish , and lower in added sugar, and red and processed meat . (Grade: Limited) Methods A literature search was conducted using four databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and CINAHL ) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention/exposure of dietary pattern s during pregnancy and the outcome of gestational weight gain . A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases s earched. Articles were screened by two NESR analysts independently for inclusion based on pre -determined criteria . Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were checked for accuracy. The Committee q ualitatively synthesized the body of evidence to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and graded the strength of evidence using pre -established criteria for risk of bias, consistency, directness, precision, and generalizability. Summary of the evidence This systematic review includes 26 articles , including five from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 from 19 prospective cohort studies published between 2009 and 2019. Articles included in this review assessed one of the following interventions/exposures during pregnancy: o Dietary patterns (DP s) (24 studies ). o Diets based on macronutrient distribution s outside of the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR) (2 studies ). Eight of the 15 articles that assessed maternal DPs usi ng an index/score method showed an association with gestational weight gain (GWG) . o Five of the eight articles showed that greater adherence to a DP (identified as beneficial by the study) was associated with lower GWG . o Three articles showed that greater a dherence to a DP (identified as 13 beneficial by the study) was associated with greater GWG in all participants or only women with obesity. Four of the five articles that assessed maternal DPs using a factor or cluster analysis showed one or more association s between adherence to DPs and GWG . o One article showed that greater adherence to a DP (identified as beneficial by the study) was associated with lower GWG . o Four articles showed that greater adherence to a DP (identified as detrimental by the study) was as sociated with higher GWG . One study that assessed maternal DPs using reduced rank regression showed that greater adherence to a DP was associated with higher GWG . Two RCT s showed that participants randomized to a DP (identified as beneficial by the study ) had lower GWG . One RCT and one prospective cohort study showed no association between maternal consumption of a diet higher in fat (i.e. >35 percent of total energy from fat, which is greater than the AMDR) and GWG . Although the DPs examined were characterized by combinations of different foods and beverages, the patterns that were consistently shown to be associated with lower risk of excessive GWG were: higher in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, and fish and lower in added sugar and red and processed meat. o Not all foods were part of the same DP. The evidence did not show a consistent association between grains or dairy and GWG. The ability to draw strong conclusions was limited by the following issues: o There were few RCTs and thus data were primarily observational in nature, limiting the ability to determine causal effects of DPs on GWG. o Key confounders were not consistently controlled for in most of the studies. o Studies had risk -of-bias issues, including exposure misclassification, self - reported outcomes, and selection bias. o Most of the studies were not designed to assess the association between DPs and GWG. o People with lower SES, adolescent s, and racially and ethnically diverse populations were underrepresented i n the body of evidence. 14 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between dietary patterns consumed during pregnancy and gestational weight gain?

(Grade: Limited) Summar y of the evidence This systematic review includes 26 articles ,1-26 including five articles from four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 21 articles from 19 prospective cohort studies published between 2009 and 2019. Articles included in this review assessed one of the following interventions/exposures during pregnancy: o Dietary patterns (DP) ( 24 studies ). o Diets based on macronutrient distribution s outside of the acceptable macronutrie nt distribution range (AMDR) ( 2 studies ).

Description of the evidence This systematic review included articles that address the relationship between dietary patterns and/or diets based on macronutrient distribution s outside of the AMDR during pregnancy and gestational weight gain (GWG). The search included articles from high and very high Human Development Indexii countries and the search time frame spanned between January 2000 and November 2019. Studies considered in this body of evidence included pregnant women who were generally healthy. The following study designs were included: randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non -randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and nested case -contr ol studies. This body of evidence includes 26 articles , including five from four RCTs22-26 and 21 from 19 prospective cohort studies .1-21 A total of 23 d istinct trials/cohort studies are represented in this body of evidence. References are included for each study in Table 1 with trial/cohort names or locations when names were unavailable. Six studies were conducted in the U.S.6,7,9,11 -13,16,25 In addition, three studies were conducted in Spain ,1,2,23,26 two each in the U.K.,22,24 Norway ,5,21 and Japan3,4; and one each in Mexico ,18 Italy,19 Poland ,17 Iceland ,14 Finland ,10 the Netherlands ,8 China ,15 and Malaysia .20 ii The Human Development classification was based on the Human Development Index (HDI) ranking from the year the study intervention occurred or data were collected (UN Development Program. HDI 1990 -2017 HDRO calculations based on data from UNDESA (2017a), UNESCO Institute for Statistics (2018), United Nations Statistics Division (2018b), World Bank (2018b), Barro and Lee (2016) and IMF (2018). Available from: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data ). If the study did not report the year in which the intervention occurred or data were collected, the HDI classification for the year of publication was applied. HDI values are available from 1980, and then from 1990 to present. If a study was conducted prior to 1990, the HDI classification from 1990 was applied. When a country was not included in the HDI ranking, the current country classification from the World Bank was used instead ( The World Bank. World Bank country and lending groups.

Almost all of the studies were conducted in adult women (18 -45 y) who had singleton pregnancies. Of note, Fulay et al12 and Wedolowska et al17 enrolled mothers as young as 15 y and 17 y, respectively. Health characteristics: o Prepregnancy BMI : Seven studies enrolled predominantly or exclusively overweight or obese women .7,10,11,16,18,24,25 In addition, Al Wattar et al enrolled women with metabolic risk factors, including women with obesity .22 o Diabetes : 10 studies excluded women with a previous diagnosis of t ype 1 and/or 2 diabetes mellitus (as defined by the studies) .5,9-12,16,17,19,21,22,25 Two studies excluded women with one or more of the following conditions: gestation al diabetes, hypertension, and preeclampsia .18,19 In an RCT conducte d in Spain, the authors noted that approximately 25 percent of the participants had a family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus .23,26 Race/ethnicity: T hirteen of the 26 articles noted that the participants wer e predominantly or exclusively W hite (defined as 50 percent of the participants).2,6-9,11-13,21,23 -26 Nine studies did not report race/ethnici ty.1,3,5,10,14,15,17 -19 Yong et al20 reported that 89 percent of the participants were Malay and Tajima et al4 noted that 100 percent of the ir participants were Japanese. Zhu et al16 reported that the participants were predominantly Hispanic ( approximately 41.3 percent ) and Al Wattar et al22 noted that the participants were predominantly Asian ( approximately 43.7 percent ). Socio -economic status: o Maternal education : A majority of the studies reported that the participants had some college education .6-9,11-16,23,25,26 When studies reported the years of education, most noted that a majority of the participants had 12 y of education .3,17,20,21 Maugeri et al19 noted that < 20 percent of the participants had low -medium education (defined as 8 y of education), but did not give other details. Similarly, Gesteiro et al2 reported that 83 percent of the participants had medium or high education (but did not categorize education further). However, the following were exceptions: Ancira -Moreno et al noted that >50 percent of the participants had < 9 y of education .18 Fernandez -Barres et al1 reported that 63.6 percent of the participants had secondary education or less. Four studies did not report maternal education .4,5,22,24 (Note: Fulay et al,12 who used Project Viva data, reported that approximately 32 percent of their participants had a college education, 18 whereas Rifas -Shiman et al6 and Sen et al,9 who also used Project Viva data with a similar sample size as Fulay et al, reported that approximately 69 percent had col lege degrees). o Income : In the 17 articles that reported household income and/or participant employment status, the majority of women were employed and/or from middle -to-high income households .1,3,6 -9,12,15 -17,19,21,23,25,26 Two studies20,24 reported that the majority of p articipants were from low SES backgrounds. Interventions/Exposures Dietary Pattern s Dietary pattern (DP) was defined as the quantities, proportions, variety, or combination of different foods, drinks, and nutrients (when available) in diets, and the frequency with which they were habitually consumed. At minimum, there had to be a descript ion of the foods and beverages in the pattern. Dietary patterns may have been measured or derived using a variety of approaches, such as adherence to a priori patterns (indices/scores), data driven patterns (factor or cluster analysis), reduced rank regres sion, or other methods, including clinical trials. Dietary patterns were assessed using 1) index/score analysis, 2) factor analysis and principal component analysis (PCA), 3) experimental diet, and 4) reduced rank regression. A description of the studies categorized by the method used to measure dietary patterns is included below: Index/Score A nalysis Fifteen articles included in this review used one or more of the following indices/scores summarized below: Maternal Diet Quality Score (MDQS)18 Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and its modifications6,7,13 Healthy Eating Index (HEI)2,16,20 relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) score1 Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ( DASH ) and its modifications12 Mediterranean Diet Adherence (MDA)2 New Nordic Diet (NND)5 Norwegian Fit for Delivery (NFFD) Diet21 Dietary risk scores14 Healthy Food Intake Index (HFII)10 Dietary Inflammat ory Index (DII)9 Dutch Healthy Diet Index8 Factor analysis and PCA Five studies included in this review assessed dietary patterns using factor analysis or PCA.3,8,1 5,17,19 Experimental D iet Three RCTs22,23,25,26 in this review assigned participants to an experimental diet (i.e. Mediterranean diet, DASH diet) or a control di et. 19 Reduced Rank R egression One study11 assessed adherence to DPs (patterns 1 and 2) derived using reduced rank regression.

Macronutrient proportions outside of the AMDR are as follows: Carbohydrate for all age groups: < 45 or > 65 percent of energy; Protein for 19 years: < 10 or > 35 percent of energy; Fat for 19 years: < 20 or > 35 percent of energy One RCT and one prospective cohort study4,24 in this review assessed macronutrient proportions and reported the percentage of total energy from fat was higher than the AMDR for one of the groups. Time point of exposure The RCTs22-26 randomized women during the late first trimester23,26 or early second trimester22,24,25 and followed them to the end of the second trimester .22-26 Most of the cohort studies administered food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) or 24 hour recalls toward the en d of the first trimester or early in the second .2,6,8 -10,12,14,16,19 -21 Investigators typically collected retrospective dietary data reflecting early pregnancy intake (i.e. first trimester). In a few studies, maternal dietary data were collected in the second trimester3,5,13,15,17 or third trimester ,1,7 reflecting intake in the past week ,15 month ,3,7 or the entire pregnancy until that point .13,17 In a few cohorts, dietary data were collected at multiple time points and assessed at individual time points (e.g. by trimester) or combined in the analysis .6,9,11,20 Outcome The outcome cons idered in this review was gestational weight gain (GWG), reported in a number of ways, including total GWG ,2,3,7,11,12,15,16,19,22,25 GWG for a specified time period 23,24,26 or ,10 GWG rate ,1,4,8,15,18,20 and GWG adequacy .5,6,8,9,13 -15,17 - 21,23,25 The studies that assessed GWG adequacy classified GWG as inadequate, adequate, or excessive according to the Institute of Medicine (2009) guidelinesvi, with the exception of Rifas -Shiman et al,6 who used Institute of Medicine (1990) guidelinesvii, Hrolfsdottir et al,14 who used Icelandic recommendations (no reference provided ), and Assaf -Balut et al,23 who had cited a previous publicationviii. vi Institute of Medicine (US) and National Research Council (US) Committee to Reexamine IOM Pregnancy Weight Guidelines.

Washington (DC): National Academie s Press (US); 2009 vii Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Nutritional Status During Pregnancy and Lactation. Nutrition During Pregnancy: Part I Weight Gain. Washington (DC): National Academies Press (US); 1990 LM. Pregnancy . With 26 articles , there is a substantial body of evidence available to examine the association between DPs during pregnancy and GWG (Table 3, Table 4). However, there is heterogeneity in the methods used to define and assess DPs and how outcomes were reported, which made it difficult to compare results across studies. Furtherm ore, the time period of dietary assessment and the duration of the recall also varied across studies. Dietary patterns assessed via index/score Fifteen articles used indices/scores to assess DPs and the findings are described below: Ancira -Moreno et al18 assessed the association between ad herence to the Maternal Diet Quality Score (MDQS) and GWG trajectories (baseline n=660) in Mexican participants. The MDQS was based on the Mexican Dietary Guidelines and international recommendations for specific foods and was characterized by higher intak e of PUFAs, fruits and vegetables, legumes, and low -fat dairy products; lower in foods higher in saturated fat, added sugars, and red meat. The study accounted for key confounders including age, SES, physical activity, prepregnancy BMI, GDM, hypertension, and parity. Anciro -Moreno et al also adjusted for energy intake (kilocalories per day ) in the model when assessing whether diet quality was independent of total energy. The study noted the following findings: o Medium and high adherence throughout pregnancy were associated with lower risk of inadequate weight gain, but only high adherence was associated with lower risk of excessive weight gain. o When the investigators assessed specific time periods during pregnancy they noted that: Medium adherence to the MDQS was associated with significantly lower rate of weight gain during middle pregnancy (20 -30 weeks ). In late pregnancy (30 -40 w eeks ), medium and higher adherence were positively associated with the rate of GWG. When looking at weight gain beyond 40 w eeks (defined by authors as prolonged pregnancy), higher adherence was associated with lower rate of weight gain. Emond et al13 examined maternal adherence to the Alternative Healthy Eating Index -2010 (AHEI) and GWG in a U.S. -based cohort (baseline n=1,140). The AHEI -2010 was characterized by higher intake of six 'healthful' components, including: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long -chain n -3 fatty acids from foods and supplements, and PUFAs; and lower intake of four components, including: sugar -sweetened beverages and fruit juice, red and processed meats, trans fatty acids, and sodium. The primary objective of this study was to assess the as sociation between the AHEI -2010 and infant outcomes. The study reported that there were no significant differences in GWG adequacy (i.e., insufficient, adequate, excessive) based on different levels of 27 adherence to the AHEI -2010. None of the key confounder s were accounted for in the analysis. In a Spain -based cohort study with a baseline sample size of 2,195 participants, Fernandez -Barres et al1 assessed maternal adherence to the relative Mediterranean Diet (rMED) score , which was constructed by taking into account the consumption of vegetables, fruits and nuts, cereals, legumes, fish, olive oil, meat, and dairy products. The s coring for meat and dairy products was reversed. Although GWG was assessed, the study was designed to examine the association between the rMED and the child's longitudinal BMI and cardiometabolic risk. The study reported that highest adherence to the rMED DP was associated with significantly lower mean GWG ( kilogram per week ). The study did not account for any of the key confounders. In the U.S.-based Project Viva study (baseline n=2,128), Fulay et al12 examined the association between the DASH diet and GWG, in addition to other pregna ncy outcomes. The authors noted that the DASH diet was similar to the Mediterranean diet in that both are rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, and healthy fats, with limited amounts of poultry, red meat, and dairy. In addition, the DASH diet emphasize d reduced intake of sodium, saturated fat, total fat, and cholesterol, and higher intake of fiber and protein. As a variation of DASH, the authors also assessed the association between the DASH OMNI (supplemented by higher unsaturated fat intake) and GWG. After adjusting for total energy intake and key confounders (including age, race/ethnicity, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking and parity) in a statistical model, the authors reported that greater adherence to the DASH and DASH OMNI diets was associat ed with greater subsequent GWG. This was primarily observed among women who were obese during prepregnancy ( 30 kg/m2) and not in those who were overweight, normal weight or underweight. Gesteiro et al2 examined the association between maternal Mediterranean Diet Adherence (MDA) , the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) , and GWG, in a Spanish cohort study (baseline n=35). o High MDA ( 7) was characterized by the use of olive oil as the main dietary fat, higher intakes of vegetables, raw vegetables, fruits, fish or shellfish, nuts (inc luding peanuts), legumes, chicken, turkey or rabbit meat, and dishes seasoned with sofrito, sauce made with tomato, onion, leek or garlic, and simmered with olive oil, and lower intakes of red meat, veal, pork, hamburger or sausage, butter, margarine or cr eam, sweet or carbonated beverages, and commercial sweets or pastries. o The HEI was characterized by intake of cereals, grains and legumes, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy products, meat, eggs and fish, total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol (m illigrams per day), and sodium (grams per day). HEI also accounted for the intake of total fat, saturated fat, sodium and dietary variety. The primary objective of this study was to assess the association between first trimester diet quality, measured by the HEI an d MDA, and insulin sensitivity/resistance biomarkers at birth. The study accounted for key 28 confounders, including race/ethnicity, smoking, and GDM. The investigators noted that women with higher MDA ( 7) had significantly higher total GWG, when compared t o those with lower MDA (< 7). There were no significant differences in GWG between women with adequate vs. inadequate HEI adherence. o Hillesund et al5 examined the association between the New Nordic Diet (NND) and GWG and fetal grow th in this Norwegian cohort study (baseline n=66,597). The NND measured the frequency of eating of the following foods: Nordic fruits (apples, pears, plums, strawberries), root vegetables (carrots, rutabaga and various types of onions), cabbages (kale, cau liflower, broccoli and Brussels sprouts), potatoes, whole grain breads, oatmeal porridge, foods from the wild countryside (wild fish, seafood, game and wild berries), milk, and water. There were significant differences in GWG adequacy between groups, depen ding on the extent of N ND adherence. Specifically, the proportion of women with excessive GWG was higher in the low adherence group compared to the medium or high adherence groups. When stratified by prepregnancy BMI, these results were consistent for wome n with a healthy prepregnancy BMI (BMI < 25.0 kg/m2), and marginally significant for those who were overweight or obese (BMI 25 kg/m2) prior to pregnancy (p=0.076). None of the key confounders were adjusted for in the analysis. o Hillesund et al21 assessed maternal adherence to the Norwegian Fit for Delivery (NFFD) Diet in this Norwegian cohort study (based on the Norwegian Fit for Delivery trial ) with a baseline sample size of 606. The NFFD diet was characterized by 24 main meals per week, water for 44 percent of drinking events, vegetables with dinner 5 per week, fruits or vegetables as snacks 3 per week, < 1 per day sugar -rich food items, <1 per day fast-foods, snacks, or other salty food, n ever eating sweets and snacks without appreciation, buying small portion size of 1 unhealthy food items, eating beyond satiety < 1 per week, and reading nutrition labels on foods sometimes or often. The main objective of the study was to assess the assoc iation between the NFF D diet and a number of maternal and neonatal outcomes, including GWG. After accounting for the key confounders, including age, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking and parity, there was a statistically significant inverse association betwee n early pregnancy NFFD diet score and the odds of excessive GWG. This association remained significant even after adjusting for physical activity, in addition to other key confounders. There was no association between diet scores and inadequate GWG. o Hrols dottir et al,14 an Icelandic cohort study (baseline n=1,326), assessed the association between dietary risk scores and excessive GWG. A high dietary risk score was characterized by a non -varied diet, n on-adequate frequency of consumption of fruits/vegetables, dairy, and whole grain intake, and excessive intake of sugar/artificially sweetened beverages and dairy. After accounting for the key confounders, including age, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking, par ity and GDM (only in a sub -analysis), the study showed that a higher dietary risk score (which included 6 dietary risk factors - a non -varied diet, vegetables and fruits < 5 times per day, dairy intake < 2 times per day, whole grain products < 2 times per day, sugar - and artificially sweetened beverages 5 times per week, 29 dairy intake 5 times per day ) was associated with excessive GWG. Similarly higher dietary risk score with three foods (sugar - and artificially sweetened beverages 5 times per week, wh ole grain products < 2 times per day and dairy intake 5 times per day ) was associated with the risk of excessive GWG ; however, there was no association between dietary risk score when 13 foods were considered (not eating a varied diet, vegetables and fru its < 5 times per day, fish intake < 2 times per day, dairy intake < 2 times per day, whole grain products < 2 times per day, beans, nuts, seeds < 3.5 times per week, D -vitamin < 5 times per week, quality of fat - using butter rather than oil ( 50%) French fries and fried potatoes 1 times per week, sweets, ice cream, cakes, cookies 2.5 times per week, sugar - and artificially sweetened beverages 5 times per week, dairy intake 5 times per day, processed meat products 1 times per week ). o Meinila et al,10 a Finnish prospective cohort study (based on the control arm of the RADIEL trial) , assessed the association between the Healthy Food Intake Index (HFII) and GWG (baseline n=137). The primary objective of this study, however, was to assess the association between the HFII and GDM. A higher HFII score was indicative of higher adherence t o the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (NNR), characterized by the following: 1) increased consumption of vegetables, fruits, fish and seafood, nuts and seeds; 2) substituting whole grains for refined grains, vegetable oils for butter, oil -based fat instea d of butter -based spread and low -fat dairy instead of full -fat dairy; and 3) limiting beverages and foods with added sugar or salt, including snacks, sugar - sweetened drinks/juice, fast foods, and red and processed meat. Adherence to the HFII was not associ ated with GWG from the first to the second trimester. None of the key confounders were accounted for in the analysis. o Poon et al7 assessed adherence to the Alternate Healthy Eating Index for Pregnancy (AHEI -P) and its association with GWG in a U.S. -based cohort study (baseline n=893). The primary objective of this study was to examine the impact of the maternal DP on the incidence of SGA and LGA. The AHEI -P was characterized by higher intake of vegetables, whole fruit, whole grains, nuts and legumes, long -chain (n -3) fatty acids, PUFAs, folate, calcium, and iron, and lower intake of sugar -sweetened beverages, red and processed meat, trans fat, and sodium. The authors reported no significant difference in GWG across different levels of adherence to the AHEI -P. None of the key confounders were accounted for in the analysis. o Rifas -Shiman et al6 also used a modified AHEI called AHEI -P, characterized by the intake of vegetables (including tofu or soybean), fruit, ratio of white -to-red meat, fiber, trans fat, ratio of polyunsaturated -to-saturated f atty acids, and folate, calcium, and iron from foods. The authors made some changes to the AHEI by excluding alcohol and nuts and including folate, calcium and iron intake. Although the AHEI -P indices assessed by Poon et al7 and Rifas -Shiman et al6 are similar, they are not the same. The main objective of this U.S. -based study (baseline n=1,777), which used Project Viva data, was to assess the maternal characteristics associated with the AHEI -P score, with GWG measured as a secondary outcome. After adjusting for the key confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, SES and prepregnancy BMI, the study found that greater 30 adherence to the AHEI -P was not associated with altered risk for inadequate or excessive GWG. o Sen et al9 also used Project Viva data to assess the association between prenatal Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) and a number of perinatal outcomes, including GWG (baseline n=1,808). Lower DII is characterized by higher intakes of vegetables, fruit, whole -grain foods, fish/seafood, and whole eggs, and lower intakes of red or processed meats and sugar -sweetened soda. After accounting for the key confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking and parity, the study found no association between consuming a lower DII diet and GWG. o Tielemans et al8 used the Netherlands -based Generation R study data to assess the association between an a priori and an a posteriori DP and GWG (baseline n=4,097). The latter findings are discussed in the next section. The Dutch Healthy Diet Index (a priori DP) consisted of 6 components, including vegetables, fruit, dietary fiber, fish, saturated fatty acids, and sodium. After accounting for the key confounders, including, age, race/ethnicity, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking, GDM, hypertension and parity, the study found no significant association between the Dutch Health Diet Index and GWG. o Yong et al20 examined the association between diet quality and GWG in a Malaysia -based Seremben Cohort Study (baseline n=480). Specifically, the study used a modified HEI for Malaysians , which measured adherence to the seven food groups, including 1) cereals and grains, 2) vegetables, 3) fruits, 4) milk and milk products, 5) poultry, meat and egg, 6) fish and seafood, and 7) legumes. After adjusting for the key confounders, including, age, SES, physical activity, prepregnancy BMI and parity, the authors reported that a higher HEI score in the third trimester was associated with excessive GWG, irrespective of prepregnancy BMI. However, during the second trimester , the association between the HEI and GWG varied based on prepregnancy BMI. In women with a prepregnancy BMI (18.50 -24.99 kg/m2), higher HEI was associated with lower odds of inadequate GWG. In women who were overweight or obese during prepregnancy , higher HEI was associated with increased odds of excessive GWG. o Zhu et al,16 using the U.S. -based PETALS cohort, investigated the association between the HEI-2010 and GWG, although the primary objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal diet quality affected fetal growth (baseline n=2,269). The H EI-2010 included 12 components: total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables, greens and beans, whole grains, dairy, total protein foods, seafood and plant proteins, fatty acids, refined grains, sodium, and empty calories from solid fats, alcohol and added s ugars. However, for this study, alcohol intake was excluded from the empty calories component. The study reported that total GWG did not differ among women across different levels of adherence to the HEI - 2010. None of the key confounders were accounted for in the analysis. Summary : Of the 15 articles that assessed maternal DPs using an index/score method, eight showed an association with GWG .1,2,5,12,14,18,20,21 Four of the eight showed that greater adherence to a beneficial DP wa s either associated with a: 1) lower risk of excessive GWG , 5,21 2) lower rate of GWG ,18 or 3) lower mean GWG .1 An 31 additional study showed that greater adherence to a ' detrim ental' DP was associated with excessive GWG.14 However, three studies showed that higher adherence to a beneficial DP (i.e. DASH, DASH OMNI, Mediterranean D iet, HEI) was associated with higher GWG, either in all participants2 or only in obese women .12,20 Six of the eight articles2,12,14,18,20,21 that showed an association adjusted for one or more of the key confounders. Among the seven articles that did not show an association ,6-10,13,16 four did not adjust for any of the key confound ers, nor were they primarily designed to address the association between DP and GWG .7,10,13,16 In two of these, the timing of exposure assessment was also different, with one assessing maternal diet at the end of the second trimes ter13 and the other during the third trimester .7 Two other articles that did not show an association were both conducted with the same cohort (Project Viva) .6,9 Dietary patterns assessed via factor or principal components analysis Five studies3,8,15,17,19 used data -driven methods (i.e. PCA, exploratory factor analysis, and cluster analysis) to assess dietary patterns: o Maugeri et al19 used PCA to generate the following dietary patterns: o Western pattern characterized by high intake of red meat, fries, dipping sauces, salty snacks, and alcoholic drinks o Prudent patte rn characterized by high intake of boiled potatoes, cooked vegetables, legumes, pizza, and soup The primary objective of this Italian study (baseline n=232) was to assess the association between maternal DPs and total GWG. In a statistical model, the ana lysis adjusted for total energy intake and key confounders, including, age, SES, smoking, GDM, hypertension, and parity. The study reported a positive trend of GWG across tertiles of a Western DP and this was more prominent in women who were obese prior to pregnancy. On the other hand, adherence to a prudent DP was positively associated with GWG among women who were underweight before pregnancy and negatively associated with GWG among women who were overweight and obese women before pregnancy. o In a Japanes e prospective cohort study (baseline n=803), Okubo et al3 used a cluster analysis to create the following dietary patterns: o Meat and eggs pattern characterized by high intake of beef and pork, processed meat, chicken, eggs, butter, and dairy products o Wheat products pattern characterized by high intake of bread, confectioneries, fruit and vegetable juice, and soft drinks o Rice, fish, and vegetables pattern characterized by high intake of rice, potatoes, nuts, pulses, fruits, green and yellow vegetables, white vegetables, mushrooms, seaweeds, Japanese and Chinese te a, fish, shellfish, sea products, miso soup, and salt -containing seasoning The primary objective of the study was to assess the association between maternal diet and neonatal anthropometric measurements at birth. The study noted that greater adherence to t he wheat products DP was associated with significantly higher mean GWG when compared to the rice, fish, and vegetable DP. None of the key 32 confounders were adjusted for in the analysis. o In a Dutch cohort study with a baseline n=4,097, Tielemans et al8 used a PCA to generate the DPs described below: o Vegetable, Oil, and Fish pattern characterized by higher intake of vegetables, high fat dairy products, cereals (both low and high fiber), fish and shellfish, eggs and egg products, vegetable oils, coffee and tea, alcoholic beverages, and legumes o Nuts, High -Fiber Cereals, and Soy pattern characterized by higher intake of potatoes and other tubers, fruits, high and low fat dairy products, high fiber cereals, meat and meat products, fish and shellfish, coffee and tea, sugar -containing beverages, light soft drinks, nuts, seeds and olives, and soy products o Margarine, Sugar, and Snacks pattern characterized by higher int ake of potatoes and other tubers, high fat dairy products, low and high fiber cereals, meat and meat products, margarine and butter, sugar and confectionary and cakes, snacks, sugar -containing beverages, condiments and sauces, nuts, seeds and olives The pr imary objective of the study was to investigate the association between DPs and GWG. After accounting for the key confounders, including age, race/ethnicity, SES, prepregnancy BMI, smoking and parity, none of the DPs were associated with rate of GWG (g rams per week ) (mid - and late -pregnancy) in normal weight or overweight women. The findings were consistent after adjusting for total energy intake in a sensitivity analysis. Similarly, none of the DPs were associated with inadequate GWG. However, greater adhe rence to the margarine, sugar, an d snacks DP was associated with increased odds of excessive GWG compared to the lowest adherence, although per standard deviation (SD) increase in DP score was not statistically significantly associated with GWG. Tielemans et al8 also assessed the association between the Dutch Healthy Diet Index and GWG and the results were discussed in the previous section. o In a Chinese pros pective cohort study (baseline n=5,733) , Wei et al15 used cluster analysis to generate the following DPs according to the food groups that were predominant in each cluster: o Richer in cereals characterized by higher intake of cereals (rice, pasta, porridge) and eggs (fresh and preserved) o Richer in vegetables characterized by higher intake of leafy and cruciferous vegetables (dark green leafy ve getables, white leafy vegetables, broccoli, cauliflower) o Richer in meats characterized by higher intake of meats (red meat, including pork, beef, and mutton, and processed meat) o Richer in fruits characterized by higher intake of fruits (cherry/grapefruit/p lum/apple/pear/peach, banana/oranges/grape, Watermelon/pineapple/mango/litchi/longan/durian and others) and Cantonese desserts 33 o Richer in fish, beans, nuts, and yogurt characterized by higher intake of cereals (noodles, bread), poultry, animal organ meat (a nimal liver, other animal innards, animal brain and animal blood), fish (freshwater fish, seawater fish, other seafood including prawn/crab, shell fish/squid, others), bean products (soybean, other dry beans, soybean milk and bean curd), nuts (oil nuts, st archy nuts, melon), vegetables (including pumpkin/tomato/capsicums/eggplant, root vegetables including carrot, potatoes/radishes/lotus root, bean vegetables, mushrooms, sea vegetables and processed vegetables), and yogurt (snack including biscuit, cornmeal , cake/fried dough twist, confectionaries including honey, candy/chocolate, other confectionaries, sweet beverage and puffed food) o Richer in milk and milk powder characterized by higher intake of fresh milk, pasteurized milk, formula milk powder, fat free milk powder, whole milk powder, and others The primary objective of this Chinese study was to assess the association between maternal DPs and GWG. The study accounted for some of the key confounders, including age, SES, prepregnancy BMI and parity. Among C hinese pregnant women with a healthy prepregnancy BMI, a DP richer in fruits (compared to a DP richer in cereals) was positively associated with total GWG and GWG rate. A DP richer in fruits was also associated with an increased risk for excessive GWG. A D P richer in fish, beans, nuts and yogurt, compared to a DP richer in cereals, was positively associated with GWG rate in the second trimester and was associated with a reduced risk for inadequate GWG. o In a Polish prospective cohort study (baseline n=1,306) , Wesolowska et al,17 used an e xploratory factor analysis to generate three DPs: o Western pattern characterized by higher intake of refined grains, processed meat, potatoes, and low intake of whole grains o Mixed pattern characterized by intakes in between Western and Prudent patterns o Prud ent pattern characterized by high consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, poultry, and both low -fat and high -fat dairy products The primary objective of the study was to evaluate sociodemographic, lifestyle, environmental, and pregnancy -related determinants of DPs during pregnancy. The study reported no significant differences between the proportions of participants that gained rec ommended vs. low vs. high GWG across the DPs. None of the key confounders were adjusted for in the analysis. Summary : Of the five studies that assessed maternal DPs using factor analysis or PCA, four3,8,15,19 showed significant associations between a maternal DP and GWG. One study showed that greater adherence to a beneficial DP was associated with lower GWG ,19 while the same study and three others showed that greater adherence to a non -beneficial DP was associated with higher GWG .3,8,15,19 Three of the four studies that showed an association adjusted for some of the key confounders .8,15,19 The only study17 that showed no association between DP and GWG did not adjust for 34 any of the key confounders. Dietary patterns assessed using an experimental diet in an RCT Four articles from three RCTs assessed the relationship between an intervention and GWG: Al Wattar et al,22 in a multicenter U.K. -based trial (baseline n=1,252), randomized pregna nt women with metabolic risk factors such as obesity, chronic hypertension, or hypertriglyceridemia to a Mediterranean -style diet or a control diet. o Those randomized to the Mediterranean -style diet were encouraged to consume higher amounts of nuts, extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, non - refined grains, and legumes; moderate -to-high amounts of fish; low -to- moderate amounts of poultry and dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese; low amounts of red meat and processed meat; and to avoid sugary drink s, fast food, and foods rich in animal fat. Investigators provided mixed nuts (30 grams per day walnut s, hazelnuts, and almonds) and EVOO (0.5 liter per week ) to the participants. o The control group received usual care and antenatal advice as per U.K. national recommendations for antenatal care. The primary outcomes were: 1) a composite maternal outcome that combined GDM and preeclampsia, and 2) a composite infant outcome that combined stillbir th and SGA or admission to neonatal care unit. GWG was considered a secondary maternal outcome. The study showed that metabolically at -risk women randomized to a Mediterranean -style dietary pattern had lower GWG when compared to the control group. In a si ngle center, clinic -based RCT in Spain (baseline n=1,000), Assaf -Balut et al23,26 randomized pregnant women to one of the following groups: o The control group was advised to follow a Mediterr anean Diet with 2 servings vegetables per day, 3 servings of fruits per day (avoiding juices), 3 servings skimmed dairy products per day, 3 servings wholegrain cereals per day, and 2 -3 servings of legumes per week, moderate -to-high consumption of fish, low consumption of red and processed meat, avoidance of refined grains, processed baked goods, pre -sliced bread, soft drinks and fresh juices, fast foods, and precooked meals. However, they were advised to restrict the consumption of dietary fat, includin g EVOO and nuts. o The intervention group was advised to follow the same Mediterranean Diet as the control group, and were advised to also consume 40 mL per day of EVOO and 25 -30 grams per day pistachios. Investigators provided 10 liters of EVOO and 2 kilograms of roasted pistachios to the participants. The primary outcome of this RCT26 was to assess the effect of the intervention diet on GDM incidence, with GWG as a secondary outcome. When compared to the control group , the intervention DP resulted in lower GWG between 12 to 24 - 28 weeks gestation in women with a prepregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m2 (p=0.052) 35 and overweight women (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m2) (p=0.076). These findings were marginally significant. However, no signifi cant differences in GWG between the intervention and control groups were noted in women who were obese prior to pregnancy ( 30 kg/m2). When considering GWG from 12 to 36 -38 weeks , the total GWG was not different between the intervention and control group s. Although non -significant, the directionality of the findings changed. In all women, the intervention group gained more total GWG than the control group between the beginning of the second trimester to the end of the third trimester (p=0.12). Among women with a prepregnancy BMI < 25 kg/m2, the intervention group tended to gain more weight than the control group (p=0.096), whereas among obese women there was no significant difference between groups (p=0.77), and among overweight women, those assigned to th e control group tended to gain more weight than the intervention group (p=0.066). In a sub -analysis of the St. Carlos GDM Prevention Study23 with normoglycemic women , there were no significant difference s in GWG from 12 weeks to 36-38 weeks between th e control and intervention groups. Also, th e study did not report significant differences in weight gain between the intervention an d control groups after stratifying by adequacy of w eight gain (i.e. excessive, adequate, inadequate) . In a U.S. -based RCT (baseline n=281), Van Horn et al25 randomized women who overweight or obese ( prepregnancy BMI 25 -40 kg/m2) to a DASH diet and lifestyle intervention or a usual -care group, as described below: o The intervention group was assigned to a slightly modified DASH diet (called Mama -DASH) and w omen were encouraged to consume a diet with low -fat dairy products, fish, skinless poultry, lean meat and vegetable protein, unsaturated fats, fiber -rich whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. They were also advised not to consume sugar -sweetened b everages, sweets, and non -nutrient -dense snack foods. Mama -DASH was designed to calorically suit the restricted weight gain recommendations (based on IOM) and to enable pregnant women to follow the nutrition guidelines specific for this population includin g avoidance of fish considered higher in mercury, and inclusion of calcium -rich, vitamin Denriched dairy, or calcium -fortified non - dairy products. o The control group received the usual care that included bi -weekly newsletters and publicly available materni ty website links. In addition to the diet, all participants were encouraged to engage in at least 30 minutes of activity or walking > 10,000 steps per day. The primary outcome of this study was GWG at 35 weeks . The study noted that pregnant women (with a prepregnancy BMI between 25 -40 kg/m2) randomized to the intervention group gained significantly less weight when compared to their counterparts in the control group. Most participants in both groups exceeded the IOM's recommended weight gain, although it wa s less common in the intervention group (69 percent ) compared to the control group (85 percent ) (p=0.004). Physical activity goals were not achieved by the majority of participants. 36 Summary : Of the three RCTs that assessed the relationship between Mediter ranean (vs usual care) ,22 Mediterranean+EVOO (vs Medite rranean diet) ,23,26 or modified DASH (vs usual care)25 diets, two trials22,25 showed that the women in the intervention group had significantly lower GWG than their counterpa rts in the control groups. The third trial by Assaf -Balut et al23,26 showed that women assigned to the Mediterranean Diet+EVOO tended to have lower GWG only until the end of the second trimest er (p=0.052) . Both studies that showed an effect were conducted in either metabolically at-risk women22 or women who were overweight or obese prior to pregnancy .25 Consistent with these findings, Assaf -Balut et al26 showed that among overweight women, those in the intervention group tended to have lower GWG than those in the control group (p=0.076) from 12 to 24 weeks ; however, this difference was not observed in women who were obese prepregnancy . When considering GWG from 12 to 36 -38 weeks , the total GWG was not different between the intervention and control groups. Although non -significant, there was a change in directionality for certain sub - groups (i.e. normal weight, obese women) with women randomized to the intervention group gaining more weight than the control group from 12 to 36 -38 weeks .26 As part of the same trial, a sub-analysis that was restricted only to normoglycemic women showed that there was no difference in GW G from 12 to 36 -38 weeks between the intervention and control groups.23 Dietary patterns assessed via reduced rank regression In a U.S. -based study (baseline n=764), Starling et al11 arrived at DPs by \"entering the residual intakes from each food group into a reduced -rank regression model.\" Two DPs were determined using this approach: o Patter n 1 was characterized by a higher consumption of poultry, nuts, cheese, fruits, whole grains, added sugars, and solid fats. o Pattern 2 was characterized by a higher consumption of eggs, starchy vegetables, solid fats, fruits, and non -whole grains and a lower consumption of dairy foods, dark -green vegetables, and whole grains. The primary objective of this study was to assess the associat ion between maternal DPs and newborn fat mass and adiposity, with maternal GWG as the intermediate variable. The study showed that women with greater adherence to pattern 1 (tertile 3) had significantly greater GWG ( p for trend < 0.001). Similarly, women w ith greater adherence to pattern 2 (tertile 2 and tertile 3) had significantly greater GWG ( p for trend=0.03). However, none of the key confounders were adjusted for in the analysis. Diets based on macronutrient distributions As described below, one RCT24 and one prospective cohort study4 assessed the association between diets based on macronutrient distribution s and GWG. o In a U.K. -based (baseline al24 randomized obese women (BMI 30 kg/m2) to an intervention of dietary advice and physical activity delivered by health trainers vs. standard care. The primary outcome of the study was to assess the impact of the intervention on maternal (GDM) and neonatal (LGA) outcomes, with GWG reported as a secondary outcome. The dietary advice in the intervention group focused on increasing the consumption of foods with a low dietary glycemic index (GI), including replacing sugar -sweetened 37 beverages with low GI alternatives and reducing saturated fat consum ption and replacing with mono - and polyunsaturated fatty acids. At the end of the intervention, there were significant differences in total fat intake between the groups, with the control group consuming an average of 35.9 percent of total energy from fat (which is outside of the AMDR), while the intervention group consumed an average of 32.5 percent of total energy from fat. The study reported that there was no significant difference in GWG between the intervention and control groups. Physical activity wa s a co -intervention in the study but the authors reported no difference in physical activity between the intervention and control groups. o Tajima et al,4 in a Japanese prospective cohort study (baseline n=325), assessed the association between tertiles of carbohydrate intake and glucose tolerance test. Based on 3 -d dietary records collected from participants, the investigators assessed the average carbohydrate, protein, total fat, and saturated fatty acid intake, and calculated the percentage of total energy intake for each component. Carbohydrate intake was calculated by subtracting the percent total energy from fat and protein intake from 100 percent and participants were categorized into tertiles based on their carbohydrate intake. The study reported that women in di fferent tertiles of carbohydrate intake also differed significantly on percent energy from total fat intake (p<0.001). That is, women in the 'bottom' tertile for carbohydrate had 35.1 percent energy from total fat (which is outside of the AMDR); those in t he 'middle' and 'top' tertiles for carbohydrate intake had 30.3 percent and 24.6 percent energy from total fat intake, respectively. The study also reported GWG across tertiles of carbohydrate intake (i.e., 'bottom', 'middle' and 'top') and noted that the mean weight gain per week was not significantly different across the groups. None of the key confounders were adjusted for in the analysis. Summary : Two studies included in this body of evidence reported no significant difference in GWG24 or rat e of GWG4 based on varying percentages of total energy intake from fat. Of note, neither the RCT nor the prospective cohort study manipulated percentage of energy f rom fat. Further, these studies were not designed to assess the relationship between macronutrient proportions and GWG. In the U.K. based trial, the control group consumed a greater percentage of total energy from fat (which was above the AMDR) when compa red to the intervention group. GWG was meas ured as a secondary objective. While the U.K. trial did not deliberately manipulate percentage of energy from total fat, the investigators recommended replacing saturated fats with mono - and poly -unsaturated fatty acids for the intervention group, whereas routine care was recommended for the control group. The Japanese cohort study presented tertiles of carbohydrate intake and stratified GWG into categories. Women with 'bottom', 'middle' and 'top' carbohydrate inta ke also differed on percentage of total energy from fat. The study reported no difference in rate of GWG among these tertiles. Assessment of the evidenceix ix A detailed description of the methodology used for grading the strength of the evidence is available on the NES R website : https://nesr.usda.gov/2020 -dietary -guidelines -advisory -committee -systematic - 38 The following conclusion statement was supported by three RCTs and 19 prospective cohort studies an d was graded \"limited.\" The individual grading elements are discussed below and summarized in Table 5 and Table 6. \"Limited evidence suggests that certain dietary patterns during pregnancy are associated with a lower risk of excessive gestational weight gain durin g pregnancy. These patterns are higher in vegetables, fruits, nuts, legu mes, fish , and lower in added sugar, and red and processed meat\" The DPs examined were characterized by combinations of different foods and beverages. The patterns that were consistently shown to be associated with lower risk of excessive GWG commonly included the foods highlighted in the conclusion statement (i.e. higher in v egetables, fruits, nuts, legumes, fish and lower in added sugar, red and processed meat), although not all foods were part of the same pattern. Grains and dairy products were included in a number of studies; however, the association between these foods a nd GWG was inconsistent. Specifically, in the 10 articles that included dairy products in a DP, some recommended consuming low -fat dairy products, while others recommended dairy consumption in moderation (without specifying percent fat), and a few other articles reverse coded it as they considered it to be detrimental. Similarly, five articles included whole/non -refined grains in a DP, of which four included it as part of a beneficial DP (meaning the DP that included whole grains was associated with a lower risk of excessive GWG). One additional article noted that avoidance of refined grains was beneficial. In three article s, it was unclear whether the participants consumed whole or refined grains and two other articles reported that participants consumed bo th whole and refined grains. Because of these inconsistencies, it was difficult to determine the relationship b etween grains or dairy and GWG. Risk of bias was graded as limited for both RCTs and cohort studies. Most of the RCTs included in this body of evidence had notable flaws, as described below: o In a RCT conducted in Spain ,23,26 women randomized to both intervention and control groups received n utritional guidance to reduce the calorie content of their diet, individualized based on GWG in the first trimester BMI. In addition, women diagnosed with GDM in both the intervention and control group received treatment with insulin and/or diet. However, significantly more women in the control group were diagnosed with GDM. In the sub -analysis, 23 the investigators excluded participants with gestational diabetes and assessed the effect of the diet on GWG only in normoglycemic women . Since the selection of participants into this sub - analysis was based on post intervention status, this sub -analysis was treated as a \"per -protocol analysis,\" rather than an \"intention -to-treat analysis.\" reviews and in Part C of the following reference: Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee. 20 20. Scientific Report of the 2020 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee: Advisory Report to the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Health and Human Services . U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Wa shington, DC 39 o In the U.S. -based RCT ,25 there were issues with adherence, which was different between the intervention and control groups. o Outcome assessment methods were not specified in at least one RCT. Similar to the RCTs, the cohort studies had serious flaws in the design and conduct of the studies: o No studies accounted for all the key confounders. Seven studies had potentially critical bias as none of the key confounders were accounted for. o More than half of the studies had selection bias issues because selection of the participants was related to characteristics observed after the start of the exposure. o Dietary data reflected dietary intake at a single time point during pregnancy. The exposure data were self -reported (typically collected around the end of the first trimester or lat er), and thus it is possible that classification of exposure status may have been impacted by the knowledge of the outcome. o Many studies reported co -exposures which were unbalanced across treatment groups. o Outcome data were self -reported and in a few stu dies reporting of outcome data may have been influenced by the knowledge of the exposure received. o None of the studies reported having a pre -registered data analysis plan. Consistency was graded limited for both RCTs and cohort studies. Among the article s that assessed DPs using an index/score method, five showed that greater adherence to a beneficial DP was associated with a lower risk of excessive GWG . 1,5,14,18,21 However, three other articles showed that great er adherence to a beneficial DP was associated with excessive GWG .2,12,20 Seven other articles showed no association between DPs and GWG .6-10,13,16 Four of the five cohort studies3,8,15,19 that assessed DPs using factor/cluster analysis showed an association with GWG, whereas one other study found no associatio n between DPs and GWG.17 One o f the studies that assessed DP using reduced rank regression was associated with GWG.11 Two RCTs showed that the intervention diet resu lted in lower GWG.22,25 Neither of the studies that assessed the relationship between a maternal high -fat diet (>35 percent total energy from fat) and GWG showed an association.4,24 Even among studies that found similar associations, the strength of the association could not be adequately assessed because of differences in study methods, including exposure and outcome assessment methodology. The inconsis tency in findings may be explained by the following: 40 Key confounders: Many of the studies that reported null findings did not adjust for any of the key confounders. This can at least partly be attributed to the fact that the studies were not designed to as sess the association, but rather presented the data because they assessed GWG as a secondary outcome or a mediator in the study. Exposure assessment: There was heterogeneity in exposure assessment methods. Studies used different approaches to generate DP s. The foods included in each DP were also different, thus making it difficult to compare exposures across studies. The inconsistencies in findings between RCTs may have been due to differences in study populations. The two RCTs that found an effect only included overweight/obese women, or metabolically at -risk women. On the other hand, the RCT that showed no effect recruited healthy women, which might partly explain the inconsistency in study findings. Directness was graded as limited for both RCTs and p rospective cohort studies. Only half of the studies in this body of evidence were designed to assess the association between DPs and GWG. For the rest, GWG was a secondary measure and thus the objectives of these studies did not necessarily align with the systematic review question. Often this also meant that most or all of the key confounders were not accounted for in the analysis. Precision was graded as limited for both RCTs and prospective cohort studies. Most of the studies, except RCTs, did not repor t power analyses or sample size calculations. Even among the RCTs, two trials conducted power calculations for outcomes other than GWG and thus precision with respect to the present review is difficult to evaluate. Studies included in this body of evidence generally had moderate analytic sample sizes to investigate the relationship between maternal DPs and GWG. None of the studies unduly influenced the findings of this systematic review and removing a single study from this body of evidence would not likely change the conclusions. Generalizability was graded as limited for both RCTs and prospective cohort studies. About one -fourth of the included studies (n= 6), including only one RCT , were conducted in the U.S. Minority women were generally underrepresented in this body of evidence. Thirteen articles reported that their p articipants were predominantly W hite and nine others did not report race/ethnicity of the participants. With regard to SES, most women in the studies had at least some college education and participants were generally from mid -high income households. Participants were primarily adult wom en and none of the studies focused on adolescent mothers. Two RCTs recruited only women who were overweight/obese or had other metabolic risk factors. For the reasons stated above, it is unclear if the findings from this systematic review would be applicab le to a more diverse U.S. population. Publication bias is definitely a consideration for the systematic reviews. However, it may not be a serious concern for this body of evidence because at least a third of the studies reported non -significant findings w hile the others report significant findings or a mix of significant and non -significant findings. 41 Research recommendations Include diverse populations with varying age groups and different racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Foster collaborative efforts to score dietary patterns consistently, so that they can be compared and reproduced across studies. Adjust for key confounding factors in observational studies, including age, race/ethnicity, SES, physical activity, anthropometry ( prepregnancy BMI), smoking, history/diagnosis of gestational diabetes and gestational hypertension, and parity. Develop a standardized recommendation of what constitutes a 'high -fat' or 'lo w- carbohydrate' dietary pattern. 42 Included les 1. Fernandez -Barres S, Vrijheid M, Manzano -Salgado CB, et al.

Women reported diet in the previous 4wk, corresponding to the first trimester (enrolled in 11 -14 week of pregnancy). This information was converted to frequency/wk for all food groups, which was then tra nsformed into 13 predefined dietary risk factors for inadequate diet, based on the Icelandic Food Based Dietary Recommendations, which are based on the Nordic Nutrition Recommendations (2014). If the women excluded/avoided any of the main food groups (cere al, vegetables/ fruits, fish, meat, eggs, high fat foods, or dairy), they were categorized to the group not eating a varied diet. After logistic regression modeling to predict excessive GWG, the six dietary risk factors (predictors) were included in the f inal model . To construct a total dietary risk score, each participant got 1 for fulfilling the risk criteria and 0 for not fulfilling the risk criteria. The scores of the six dietary risk factors were then summed up, ranging from scores of 0 to 5 as it was not possible to be in both milk risk groups (too low/too high).

HDI 1990 -2017 HDRO calculations based on data from UNDESA (2017a), UN ESCO Institute for Statistics (2018), United Nations Statistics Division (2018b), World Bank (2018b), Barro and Lee (2016) and IMF (2018). Available from: http://hdr.undp.org/en/data). If the study did not report the year in which the intervention occurred or data were collected, the HDI classification for the year of publication was applied. HDI values are available from 1980, and then from 1990 to present. If a study was conducted prior to 1990, the HDI classification from 1990 was applied. When a country was not included in the HDI ranking, the current country classification from the World Bank was used instead (The World Bank. World Bank country and lending groups.

Articles on dietary patterns and GWG and dietary patterns and PPWL were searched for and screened 106 together . This was done to leverage the overlap in topical areas and to improve efficiency . After the initial electronic database search (January 2000 -June 2019), an updated sea rch was conducted to also capture macronutrient distribution articles (January 2000 -November 2019). The results of both electronic database searches, after removal of duplicates, were screened independently by two NESR analysts using a step -wise process by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full -texts to determine which articles met the inclusion criteria for each systematic review question depicted in the flow chart. Refer to Table 8 for the rationale for exclusion for each excluded full -text article. A manual search was done to find articles that were not identified when searching the electronic databases; all manually id entified articles are also screened to determine whether they meet criteria for inclusion. Figure 2: Flow chart of literature search and screening results 107 Excluded a rticles The table below lists the art icles excluded after full -text screening, and includes columns for the categories of inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Table 7) that studies were excluded based on. At least one reason for exclusio n is provided for each article , though this may not reflect all possible reasons for exclusion. Information about articles excluded after title and abstract screening is available upon request. Table 8.
