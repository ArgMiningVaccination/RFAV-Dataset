Admission Policies and Procedures Florida National University has an open door admissions policy and welcomes all qualified applicants without regard to ethnic background, sex, rel igion, national origin, age, or physical handicap. An Open Door Enrollment Admissions policy means that any student with a high school diploma or GED certificate can attend. With guaranteed acceptance, open admissions policies are all about access and opportunity: any student who has completed high school has the option of pursuing a college degree. Open Enrollment Admission colleges do not require SAT or ACT test scores, but students are expected to take a diagnostic test upon admission to test their co mpetency. The test will be used to determine whether students will be required to take remedial or developmental coursework before being allowed to take college level courses. The open admission policy does not mean that there are no restrictions on ad mission to specific programs . It does mean that these restrictions are flexible enough to allow students opportunities to improve their educational status by eliminating deficiencies through remedial work. New students seeking admission to a specific progr am must provide appropriate transcripts and participate in placement assessment to meet prerequisites/co -requisites. When new students are able to meet the specific admission requirements for a given curriculum, they may then be enrolled in that curriculum and remain in the program as long as they make satisfactory progress and remain enrolled on a continuous basis as required by their curriculum. Admission to the college does not guarantee admission to all programs or courses, as some programs may be hig hly selective. Although the University follows an open door admissions policy, there will be no compromise with academic standards. 25 ADMISSION PROCEDURES Applications for admission are processed under a policy of continuous admissions. They are initia ted at the Admissions Office. An admissions representative, the registrar, and the financial aid officer interview the applicant to discuss student career goals, program schedules, costs, required documents, placement or diagnostic tests as applicable, an d eligibility for financial assistance. These interviews conclude with the signing of the Enrollment Application , a contract that covers all obligations between FNU and the student. OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS Applicants must request official academic transcrip ts from their high school, and these transcripts are to be mailed directly to the Registrar's Office. Each applicant is responsible for initiating the request(s) for transcripts, and for verifying that they are received at the Registrar's Office within th e student's first semester. (Interna tional students , refer to page 26). Applicants holding a high school diploma or GED diploma must bring the original documents to the Registrar's Office.

This score qualifies the applicant for enlisting, the career field or mil itary occupation, and eligibility to enroll in university courses/programs. Scores of 31 and 35 indicate that the students are performing at high school level (12th) and do not require remediation. Applicants need to provide the official transcripts from t he Armed Forces (DOD). This procedure does not apply for discharged personnel, veterans and family members. Its purpose is to facilitate admissions to military personnel that are in active duty and are unable to take the Diagnostic exam due to technical p roblems with the delivery.

If students come with documentation from a foreign university, the above g uidelines apply to them since that indicates that they have had to complete high school prior to entering their programs of study. In the case that a student cannot provide a high school diploma, and he/she states that it was completed in his/her countr y; we recommend that an equivalency test be taken. If you are an international student studying in the US, you need to remember that you are restricted by the terms of your visa.

This final evaluation will be uploaded in the system and a notification will be send to the Office of Financial Aid for computation. Grade point averages are not transferred; but courses transferred will appear on the student's transcripts with t heir respective/earned grades. Transfer credits are granted only for those courses in which a grade of \"C\" or better was earned.

For internal transferability from one program to a nother program, the student must satisfactorily pass at least 25% of the credits corresponding with the new career to graduate. FNU will accept credits from regionally accredited institutions that are applicable to the applicant's program of study. FNU will accept credits from non -regionally accredited institutions for courses that are substantially equivalent in content to FNU's courses and applicable to the applicant's program and evaluated on a course - by-course basis. The acceptance of classes from non -regionally accredited institutions is contingent upon appropriate faculty credentials and applicable course content to the degree program . Additionally, FNU accepts transfer credits from nationa lly accredited institutions that participate in the Florida Statewide Course Numbering System . Credits from international institutions will be evaluated and granted on course equivalency basis. The transcript must be translated into English and evaluated by an authorized educational evaluations and translations agency. Credit is not awarded for developmental, preparatory, or vocational coursework. Credit will be awarded for CLEP and AP test scores in compliance with FNU's policy on these tests. Credit will be awarded for DANTES test programs in accordance with the recommendations of the American Council on Education. A maximum of 15 credits will be accepted from test scores. The credits must be earned before the student is enrolled or within the first two s emesters.

Re-Enrollment / Readmission Typically, a Re-Enrollment is a student who withdrew and request s enrollment in another program and Readmission is for students who withdrew and desire to return to the same program within five years. All re - entry must be processed by the Friday before the start date of every term. In both cases students must satisfy the readmission procedures as follows: 1. The student who withdrew with a CGPA of 2.0 or better and a clear balance will resume his/her studies following regular admission procedures. 2. The student who was terminated because of academic probation or lack of attendance and has two consecutive semesters with a GPA under 2.0 cannot be consider ed for Re -Enrollment or Readmission unless the student request s a waiver of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. The following process will apply: a) A student who has been dropped or suspended because of inability to maintain a CGPA of 2.0 may reapply to Florida National University after being out of school for a minimum of one term. At that time, the student's academic records will be evaluated to determine if it is 31 possible for a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame of 1.5 time of the normal time frame for completion. If it is not possible for the student to meet both standards, the student will no longer be eligible for Title IV funds. b) Additionally , Florida National University may use its discretion in waiving its Satisfactory Academic Progress Pol icy in cases where students have mitigating circumstances. Student s requesting an appeal must submit a written request, with appropriate documentation, to the Vice President of Academic Affairs and the Vice President/Director of Financial Aid. If the appeal is approved, the student will be allowed one additional semester to meet the required standards and will be eligible for Title IV funds. 3. The student who was terminated because of inability to fulfill costs will have to pay the complete balance before classes start. 4. The student who was terminated because of serious violations of FNU rules may not reapply at FNU for admission. Additionally, Florida National University reserves the right to reject the application request of any student wh o comes from any other institution where the student has lost \"Good Standing\" status.

The plan must include: 1. The use of technology -based deterrents; 2. An educational component regardin g appropriate and inappropriate use of copyrighted materials; 3. A description of the institution's policy and procedures for handling copyright infringement; and 4. A required periodic review of the plan. Use of Technology -Based Deterrents Florida National Un iversity uses a number of technical means to monitor Peer to Peer (P2P) file sharing on its network. Information that is maintained includes records of P2P file sharing sessions of all Faculty, Staff and Students. This information includes source and dest ination information, usernames, files being transferred, and information on the P2P application being used. When P2P traffic is observed on the network the file being transferred is identified and compared against an extensive database of known content (Movies, TV shows, Music, Software, etc.) that is subject to a claim of copyright protection.

If, with in ten d ays after a copy of the student, faculty or staff member 's request is sent to the copyright holder by the Designated Agent, the Designated Agent has not received a written request from the copyright holder to continue the blocking or removal of the allegedly infringing material, the Designated Agent will notify the University's IT department to restore the material so long as the University's attorneys, if they have been consulted, agree that the material does not constitute an infringement of copyright. The University's IT 45 department may restore the allegedly infringing material within four (4) days of the receipt of su ch not ification and th e material may be downloaded again by the student, faculty or staff member.

Loans made through this program are referred to as FFEL Loans. Private lenders provide funds that are guaranteed by the federal government. FFEL loans include subsid ized and unsubsidized FFEL Stafford Loans, FFEL PLUS Loans and FFEL Consolidation Loans The Subsidized F FEL is based on financial need using a federal formula. Repayment begins six months after graduation or when enrollment drops below half time. Repayme nt may run up to 10 years. The Unsubsidized Federal Stafford Loan is not based on need and is avai lable to students regardless of family income. However, because the government does not subsidize the loan, the student is responsible for all interest, whi ch accrues during in -school, grace and deferment periods. Federal Parent Loan (PLUS) - Parents of dependent students may borrow up to the difference between the costs of education minus other financial aid. The borrower must have a good credit history. Interest Rate for FFEL For loans first disbursed on or after July1st, 2008, the interest is 6.0 for subsidized Stafford loans for undergraduate students and 6.8 percent for unsubsidized Stafford loans for undergraduate and graduate students. FFEL PLUS L oans first disbursed on or after July 1st, 2008 have a fixed interest rate of 8.5 percent. Direct Loans first disbursed on or after July 1st, 2006 have a fixed interest rate of 7.9 percent. Over a four -year period beginning July 1st, 2008 the interest rat e on subsidized Stafford loans made to undergraduate students, with a first disbursement date on or after July 1st, 2008, will be reduced as shown in the following chart: Interest Rate Reductions for Subsidized Stafford Loans First disbursement of a Loan: Made on or after And made before Interest rate on the unpaid balance July 1st, 2008 July 1st, 2009 6.0 percent July 1st, 2009 July 1st, 2010 5.6 percent July 1st, 2010 July 1st, 2011 4.5 percent July 1st, 2011 July 1st, 2012 3.4 percent This change does not affect any prior loans made to these or any other borrowers, the terms and interest rates of those prior loans remain unchanged.

Contact the Financial Aid Department for more information. FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM A Pell Gran t is an entitlement program designed to assist undergraduates in paying for their education. 1. The U.S. Department of Education evaluates applications. 2. The Department of Education uses a standard formula in their evaluation, which guarantees equal treatment for all applicants, but it also means that, except for a few specific cases, there are no exceptions made for unique financial circumstances of students or their families. The formula used to determine the Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) is too long to be included in this catalog. However, a pamphlet that describes the formula in detail can be obtained by writing to Federal Student Aid, P.O. Box 84, Washington, DC, 20044. 3. Demonstrate financial need. The Department of Education mails an Insti tutional Student Information Record (ISIR) directly to the student, which the student submits to FNU, even if there is no award. 4. Be a high school graduate or hold a GED diploma. The amount of the award is determined by the Estimated Family Contributio n (EFC), which is reported in the ISIR. 5. Student should pay attention to the effect that receiving Pell Grants for more than one academic year of attendance in Remedial classes or ESL program has on the Lifetime Eligibility Used which at this moment is a maximum eligibility of 12 semesters. 53 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENTAL EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY GRANT (FSEOG) Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants are awarded to undergraduate students with exceptional financial need who will also receive Federal Pell Grants during the award year. FSEOG funds are limited and students should apply at the time of admission to FNU for these funds. In order to serve the best interests of our students, FNU allocates a percentage of these funds for each starting class. Fir st priority for receiving an FSEOG award will be an applicant with the lowest expected family contribution (EFC) who is also Pell eligible. If all Pell eligible students receive an FSEOG award, the next priority would be students with the lowest expected family contribution (EFC) who are not Pell eligible.

To continue receiving aid at the new university , the student must check with a Financial Aid officer at the new university to find out what programs are avai lable and what steps are necessary. Students who decide to transfer must have the former univer sity send a financial aid transcript to the new university . If the new university does not receive this transcript, the student will have difficulty receiving financial aid. Transfer students who have a Federal Pell Grant must get a duplicate copy of the ir Student Aid Report and submit it to the new university 's financial aid office. Transfer students who have a Federal Perkins Loan or a Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant should check with the Financial Aid Office at the new school to fin d out if funds from these programs are avai lable. 68 NOTIFICATION OF FINANCIAL AID AWARDS The student is notified of his or her awards in an award letter. If the student feels the awards do not cover his or her needs, the student should consult with FNU's Financial Aid Officer. REESTABLISHING ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL AID Students who have been terminated for lack of satisfactory academic progress (2.0) and seek to reestablish their eligibility for financial aid must first successfully complete courses with out benefit of financial aid in order to reestablish good academic standing. DISBURSEMENT PROCEDURES Awards will be made in accordance with the award letters issued by the Office of Financial Aid. Federal Pell Grant or campus base checks will be made pay able directly to FNU in a separate check for each student's account. Financial Aid awards will be disbursed electronically and will be applied to each student's account. WORKFORCE INVESTMENT ACT (WIA) The WIA program provides tuition assistance for stud ents who meet the eligibility requirements of the programs. To determine if you are eligible, you should apply directly to the WIA office. The WIA coordinator for FNU has an office at the Hialeah Campus. Academic Policies and Procedures ACADEMIC YEAR The FNU academic year is defined as two semesters. The length of an academic semester is four months. Each semester has two terms of two months each. The FNU rolling admission schedule makes it possible to have six different start dates and six different c ompletion dates in one calendar year. There is a one -week break in April, a one -week break in August , and a two -week break at the Christmas/New Year season. ACADEMIC ADVISEMENT Upon entering FNU, each freshman is advised to see his or her program academic advisor or academic advisor . In addition, each of the offices listed below provides advisement in its field of responsibility to all students as appropriate. These offices are: The Admissions Office The Financial Aid Office The Campus Dean The Stude nt Services Office The Registrar's Office The Advising Center The Academic Advising Center Advising new and current students who are in a career/program. Explain and review academic requirements. Once student has completed successfully their first 4 term s they are transferred to a faculty advisor of their chosen career. What is the purpose of Academic Advising? The primary purpose of academic advising is to assist students in the development of meaningful educational plans that are compatible with thei r life goals. 69 Based on their program of studies, students should contact their Division Head for advisor's name and contact information. The instructors advise their student's concerning academic progress as well as academic matters. The Office of Student Services has information on other colleges, universities, and scholarship The ultimate responsibility for making decisions about life goals and educationa l plans rest with the individual student. The academic advisor assists by helping to identify and ev aluate the alternatives and the consequences of decisions. The academic advisor will be able to direct the student in the right direction depending on his/her life goals and offer recommendations in the following areas: 1. Career options 2. Program Choice 3. Cours e Scheduling PROGRAM ACADEMIC ADVISOR To find out whom your Program Academic Advisor is and to set up an appointment as soon as possible, contact a Division or Department Head or the Program Director . Here is the list of Department, Division Heads , and Pr ogram Directors by their respective division: Dr. Loreto Almonte Allied Division Head 3333 ext: 1074 lalmonte@fnu.edu Dr. Carlos 3333 ext: 1074 ccuervo@fnu.edu Mr. Jose Antonio Lammoglia, RRT, Director Ph: (305) ext: 1074 jlammoglia@fnu.edu Dr. Victor Fernandez, RDMS, RCS Program Director 821 3333 ext: 1074 vmfernandez@fnu.edu Dr. Kelly Krenkel, PT, DPT Physical Program Director Ph: 3333 ext: 1048 (305) 821 3333 mrestrepo@fnu.edu Dr. James Bullen (305)821 -3333 ext: 1077 jbullen@fnu.edu Dr. (305)821 -3333 -3333 ext: 1149 josep@fnu.edu Oscar Perez, M.A. Ph: (305)821 -3333 ext: 1103 Campus Ph: (305)821 -3333 ext: 1103 mabreira@fnu.edu Ariel Oquendo, B.A., Hialeah ext: 1348 aoliveira@fnu.edu CLASS SCHEDULES Most courses are scheduled as either three or four -hour sessions, held Monday through Friday, anytime from 8:30am - 10:00pm. Some courses are offered on Saturdays and clinical practices are offered 7 days a wee k, (scheduling based on program requirements and site availability). FNU also offers internet -based distance learning courses. FNU has a self -scheduling procedure established for some of the programs offered and it can be accessed through the FNU Portal. Certificate programs that run sequentially do not have the ability to have classes self - scheduled. Degree Programs have the self -scheduling option except Nursing Programs (ADN, BSN and MSN) as well as Physical Therapy Assistant, Sonography, Radiology and Respiratory Therapy core courses. Specific instructions are posted in https://www.fnu.edu/Publications/Registration_Instructions.pdf fnu.edu Changes to the class sch edule can be made only during the ADD/DROP period (first week of the semester ). Any changes to the schedule must be approved by the Department/Division Head and a Cancel/Add form must be filled out and turned in to the Registrar's Office. The Cancel/Add fo rm is available at the Registrar's Office of each Campus and on the FNU website. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail ( eperez @fnu.edu -0595, Attenti on to: Registrar's Office. Additional questions about the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to Dr. Emry Somnarain at esomnarain@fnu.edu . Class schedule changes are subject to class load and availability. The student must check the FNU student por tal to ensure that changes are accepted. In order to access or print your class schedule, you must set up an account on the FNU student portal. Instructions are available on the FNU website. A user name and password is required. You will also be able to use the FNU Portal to access other pertinent information. It is the student 's responsibility to withdraw, cancel, or change any courses assigned to him/her during the ADD/DROP period . After the ADD/DROP period, no schedule changes will be accepted for the Term B, unless it is an emergency, and the student will be charged for the change $50.00 per change. Approved changes for Term B can only be done by substituting the class with another course carrying the same credit load and by paying the $50.00 fee. Ple ase note that all changes carry a $50.00 fee even if it just a change of session. CLASSIFICATION OF STUDENTS OR STATUS STUDENTS ARE CLASSIFI ED IN VARIOUS WAYS : A. By class load: 1. Full time ( 12 credit hours minimum per semester ) * For Under graduate Programs 2. Full time ( 9 credit hours minimum per semester ) * For Graduate Programs 3. Three Quarter time ( 9 credit hours minimum per semester ) For Undergraduate Programs 4. Half time ( 6 credit hours minimum per semester ) For both Graduate and Und ergraduate Programs 5. Less than halftime (less than 5 credit hours per semester) For both Grad uate/Undergraduate Programs 71 * Students receiving full financial aid cannot carry less than six credit hours per semester . Students carryin g less than the required minimum number of credits may receive financial aid proportionally. B. By credits earned: 1. Freshman (1 to 30 credits) 2. Sophomore (31 and above) 3. Junior (61 and above) 4. Senior (91 and above) C. By program of study: 1. Baccalaureate or Associate Degree students 2. Diploma students 3. Certificate students 4. Early Admission 5. Transient students (courses for transference to other insti tutions or Employee/Family Members ) 6. Non-degree seeking students D. By legal status: 1. Florida residents 2. Non-Florida residents 3. International students E. By sponsorship 1. Personal resources 2. Grant 3. Loan 4. Scholarship 5. VA 6. Employee Scholarship 7. ITA 8. Vocational Rehab. TRANSIENT AND NON -DEGREE -SEEKING STUDENT ADMISSION A student who is in good standing at another college or university may be admitted to Florida National University as a transient student. Transient students should consult the appropriate Dean or Registrar at the university to which they wish their credits transferred to determine the acceptability of outside credits at their home institution. For classification purposes, employees or family member s seeking credits at FNU are also referred to as Transient students. Applicants who are taking a course, but without enrolling in a progra m, are classified as non -degree seeking students. At Florida National University these students are limited to thirt y credits in this classification, and they are not eligible for financial aid. CLASS LOAD, CREDIT HOUR AND CLOCK HOUR EQUIVALENCY Class load refers to the number of credits a student carries in a semester . For degree and career programs a student may carr y a load of 17 credit hours maximum per semester . One credit hour equals 15 clock hours of lecture, 30 clock hours of Lab., 45 clock hours of externship , or 100 clock hours of pre-clinical or clinical journal . One clock hour is equivalent to 50 minutes o f lecture and a 10 - minute break. 72 Utilizing the definition that an hour of work is the equivalent of 50 minutes of class time (often called a contact hour), the university policy requires at least 45 hours of work by each student for each unit of credit. Contact hours required for specific types of courses are as follows: At least 15 contact hours of lecture as well as a minimum of 30 hours of student homework are required for each unit of student credit. Laboratory courses must maintain a minimum of 45 contact hours per unit of credit. Each unit of internship or practicum must require a minimum of 45 hours of work. Certificate Programs: Since courses within a certificate program are not acceptable for credit toward a degree program within the instituti on, the conversion formula for certificate programs is as follows: one c redit hour equals 37.5 clock hours of lecture, 37.5 clock hours of Lab., or 37.5 clock hours of externship (30 hours should be in the classroom and 7.5 hours are external) . SATISFACT ORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS All student s must meet certain minimum standards for Satisfactory Academic P rogress while enrolled at Florida National University (FNU) . In order to achieve Satisfactory Academic Progress, a student must satisfy three criteria, each of which is evaluated, on a cumulative basis, at the end of each semester. The three criteria are: Cumulative Grade Point Average (must meet minimum thresholds in table below) Pace of Progression (must successfully complete at least 66.7% of credits att empted) Maximum Time Frame (must complete the program in no more than 1 50 percent of the normal time frame for completion) GRADE POINT AVERAGE: The grade point average or GPA for a semester is calculated by dividing (a) a number equal to the sum of credi t hours for each course attempted during the semester times the quality point value for each grade earned in the course by (b) a number equal to the number of credit hours attempted during the semester (i.e., hours from courses with grades A through F). The cumulative grade point average , or CGPA, is obtained by calculating the GPA for all courses attempted at Florida National University with grades of A through F . Course grades of S, U, I, W, AU, and TC do not count in the overall CGPA since they carry no quality points, but they do count as credits attempted for purposes of determining the Pace of Progression . The minimum CGPA required to maintain SAP varies depending on the program the student is enrolled in and the number of credits the student has att empted, as set forth in the Table below . See the Grading Syste m section for more information . PACE OF PROGRESSION: Pace of Progression is measured by calculating, at the end of each semester, the cumulative number of credits successfully completed (i. e., courses with a grade of A through D) as a percentage of the cumulative number of credits attempted. MAXIMUM TIME FRAME: The maximum time frame for completing a program is equal to 150 percent of the normal time frame for completing the program as meas ured in credit hours. For example, a full -time student in a baccalaureate program normally would complete the program in four academic years with 120 semester hours. The maximum time frame for such a student to complete the program would be 180 semester hours. The Pace of Progression requirement is intended to ensure that the students are on pace to graduate within the Maximum Time Frame. Maintenance of Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) is a requirement for graduation; it is also necessary in order t o maintain eligibility for Title IV financial assistance. FNU evaluates Satisfactory Academic Progress at the end of every semester. 73 Students must continue to meet the minimum SAP standards as measured at the end of each semester, in order to maintain e ligibility for financial assistance. The CGPA and Pace of Progression are be based on all periods of enrollment even when the student did not receive Title IV funds. However, should a student change programs at FNU, SAP will be based on all coursework tha t is applicable to the student's current degree, diploma, or certificate program of study. If the student does not meet the minimum SAP standards at the end of a semester, the student will be placed on Academic/Financial Aid Warning for the following semes ter. All students on Academic/Financial Aid Warning will be monitored for SAP again at the end of the semester on Academic Warning. Students who are eligible for Federal student aid funds continue to receive those funds while on Academic Warning. All st udents on Academic /Financial Aid Warning who meet the minimum SAP standards at the end of the semester will be removed from Academic /Financial Aid Warning. Any student who fails to meet the minimum SAP standards at the end of the semester on Academic /Financial Aid Warning will be considered for dismissal and suspended for the coming semester. The student may appeal the suspension by submitting a written request explaining and documenting why the student failed to achieve SAP, such as the death of a relat ive, an injury or illness, or other special circumstances, and how circumstances have changed such that the student will be able to achieve SAP at the end of the next semester if permitted to re -enroll. A student requesting an appeal must submit a written request to the Vice President of Academic Affairs and Vice President/Director of Financial Aid . If the appeal is granted, the student may re -enroll and will be placed on Academic /Financial Aid Probation for the coming semester. If eligible for Federal student a id, those funds will continue during the semester on Academic /Financial Aid Probation. All students on Academic /Financial Aid Probation are monitored again for SAP at the end of the semester on Academic /Financial Aid Probation. All such students who satisfy the minimum SAP standards at the end of the semester will be removed from Academic /Financial Aid Probation, and will continue to remain subject to the SAP requirements. All students on Academic /Financial Aid Probation who do not satisfy the S AP requirements at the end of the semester will be dismissed. All financial aid applicants in eligible degree/diploma/certificate programs are evaluated for SAP whether they received financial assistance in prior terms or not. If the student attended FNU in the past and seeks to re -enroll, the student will be reviewed for SAP for financial aid purposes on all previously attempted courses that are applicable to the student's current program of enrollment regardless of how long ago the student attended F NU or whether or not aid was received. When a student transfers course credits to FNU, transfer credits count as credits attempted and credits earned. The student may modify the initial course schedule up to the last day of the add/ drop period with a re fund. Classes that are dropped during this time period are not counted as part of the SAP evaluation process. If the student withdraws after the add/ drop period, it will negatively affect the Pace of Progression and Maximum Time Frame requirements because the credits will count as credits attempted but not credits earned. If a student repeats a course, the higher grade is used in the CGPA but credits for both courses count as credit hours attempted. If the student changes degree or certificate programs, the SAP calculation will reset to only count those credits that are applicable to the student's new program of study. Credits that do not count toward the new program of study will not be included in the pace calculation and the related grades will not be included in the CGPA. 74 Remedial credit hours completed are used in Grade Point Average calculations, but not in Pace of Progression, and Maximum Time Frame calculations . Master Degree Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semester Minimum % of cumulative credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 36 3.0 66.7% Bachelors and Associate Degree Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semester Minimum % of cumulative credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 12 1.3 66.7% 13 - 24 1.5 66.7% 25- 36 1.7 66.7% 37 - 48 1.8 66.7% 49 - 60 2 66.7% 60 - above 2 66.7% Diploma Programs Credits Attempted Minimum CGPA at end of each semes ter Minimum % of credits attempted that have been successfully completed at end of each semester 1 - 12 1.3 66.7% 13 - 24 1.5 66.7% 25- 30 2 66.7% 45 - above 2 66.7% Certificate Programs Credits Attempt Warning if CGPA is below Minimum Credits (%) to Complete 0 - 9 1.5 66.7% 10 - 18. 2 66.7% A student who has been dismissed for failure to satisfy SAP following a semester on Academic/Financial Aid Probation may reapply to Florida National University after being out of school for one semester . If re- admitted, the student will remain subject to all SAP requirements and, if otherwise eligible for Federal student aid, will not be eligible to receive such funds until and unless the students meets all SAP requirements. ATTENDANCE POLICY The policy o n attendance for university classes will be the responsibility of the professor, and the professor will fully inform students of such policy at the beginning of the semester . The faculty and staff at Florida National University want you to succeed. Since studies indicate a positive relationship between good attendance and better grades, you are strongly encouraged to attend all classes and arrive on time. * Individual instructors establish their own class attendance policies. Each instructor's policy is included in the course syllabus and distributed at the beginning of each semester . 75 * It is your responsibility to understand and follow these policies and, if possible, to notify instructors in advance when it is necessary to miss a class. * Any anticip ated prolonged absences should be reported to instructors as soon as possible. * If you stop attending class ( es) for any reason, you must consult with your instructor(s) and registrar about possible withdrawal from the class (es). VETERAN'S ATTENDANCE PO LICY Early departures, class cuts, tardies, etc., for any portion of a class period will be counted as 1 absence. Students exceeding 20 % total absences in a calendar month will be terminated from their VA benefits for unsatisfactory attendance . In order to show that the cause of unsatisfactory attendance has been removed, students must show good attendance (as defined) for one calendar month after being terminated for unsatisfactory attendance . After such time, the student may be recertified for VA education benefits. The student's attendance record will be retained in the veteran's file for USDVA and SAA audit purposes. LEAVE OF ABSENCE Any student requesting a leave of absence (LOA) from the institution must submit a written request to the Registrar 's Office. The LOA request form is located at the Registrar's Office of every campus or can be downloaded from the FNU website. Distance Learning students must submit the completed form to the Registrar's Office via either e -mail ( eperez @fnu.edu Attention to: Registrar's Offi ce. Additional questions about the Distance Learning Department can be emailed to Dr. Emry Somnarain at esomnarain@fnu.edu . The Leave of Absence must be requested ONLY during the ADD/DR OP period. The request needs to be signed and dated by the student and must include the date student expects to return to school. The request must be approved by the campus registrar and a financial aid officer. Federal regulations allow an approved leav e of absence of no more than 180 days. There are no exceptions. Multiple leave of absences can be granted not exceeding 180 days. An LOA extends the graduation date. Students on LOA will normally not be able to maintain their course sequencing. A studen t on leave of absence will not incur additional charges by the school during this period, though monthly payments must continue during the LOA. If the student does not report back to FNU by the add/drop period of the following semester, the student will be considered to have withdrawn from school as of the first day of the new semester. The University has thirty days after the last day of an approved leave of absence to process financial assistance refunds to grantors. By official regulation, internatio nal students may use a leave of absence (LOA) only after completion of one academic year (8 months). 76 STANDARD PERIOD OF NON -ENROLLMENT Students enrolled in Certificate Programs, and planning to be out of FNU for one term (two months) , must submit a wri tten request for a Standard Period of Non -Enrollment to the Registrar's Office. The SPNE request form is located in the Registrar's Office or can be downloaded from the FNU website. SPNE's are usually approved for one term (two months) per semester. How ever, during the summer semester, a student can request it for four months (one semester). A Standard Period of Non -Enrollment must be requested prior to the start of the term or during the first week of classes of the term the student is planning to be away from FNU. After the ADD/DROP period, no SPNE requests are granted. Students will receive a \"W\" for that term once that SPNE is approved. If the SPNE is only for one term (two months), the student's remaining schedule of courses will remain the same . The request must be authorized by the Campus Registrar and the Financial Aid officer. Students must report to the Registrar's Office by the date indicated on the Standard Period of Non - Enrollment form. Students who fail to return to the University by the expected date will be considered to have withdrawn from the school, and the student will therefore be responsible for any balance due. An SPNE extends a student's graduation date. Students on SPNE may not be able to maintain their course sequencing. RE-ENROLLMENT / READMISSION Typically, a Re-Enrollment is a student who withdrew and requests enrollment in another program and Readmission is for students who withdrew and desire to return to the same program within five years. In both cases students m ust satisfy the readmission procedures as follows: 1. The student who withdrew with a CGPA of 2.0 or better and a clear balance will resume his/her studies following regular admission procedures. 2. The student who was terminated because of academ ic probation or lack of attendance and has two consecutive semesters with a GPA under 2.0 can't be considered for Re -Enrollment or Readmission unless the student requests a waiver of the Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. The following process will app ly: a) A student who has been dropped or suspended because of inability to maintain a CGPA of 2.0 may reapply to Florida National University after being out of school for a minimum of one term. At that time, the student's academic records will be eval uated to determine if it is possible for a 2.0 cumulative grade point average to be achieved and if the program can be completed within the maximum time frame of 1.5 time of the normal time frame for completion. If it is not possible for the student to mee t both standards, the student will no longer be eligible for Title IV funds. b) Additionally , Florida National University may use its discretion in waiving its Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy in cases where students have mitigating circumstance s. Students requesting an appeal must submit a written request, with appropriate documentation, to the Vice President of Academic Affairs and the Vice President/Director of Financial Aid. If the appeal is approved, the student will be allowed one additi onal semester to meet the required standards and will be eligible for Title IV funds. 77 3. The student who was terminated because of inability to fulfill costs will have to pay the complete balance before classes start. 4. The student who was termin ated because of serious violations of FNU rules may not reapply at FNU for admission. Additionally, Florida National University reserves the right to reject the application request of any student who comes from any other institution where the student ha s lost \"Good Standing\" status. Students that decide to continue onto a different program once a program has been completed, are not considered re -entry nor re -enrollments. TUTORIALS Free tutorials are offered in the various subject s offered at Florida N ational University . At the Hialeah Campus, tutorial information is provided b y Program Divi sion on each window case of e ach floor . The South Campus tutorials information is located in the hallway by the teachers' office. You may also contact your indivi dual instructor for additional help with the subject area you are having difficulty with. ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES The University offers English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses to incoming students who have limited English Language Proficiency to succeed at the college level. The university will use the criteria listed below to identify those students who may be eligible for EAP courses as well as the score from the institution 's diagnostic test. a) Student has a foreign high school diploma b) Student was enrolled in ESL courses during his/her 11th and 12th grades c) Student graduated from an alternative high school d) Student completed high school requirements but did not pass the FCAT exam and received a high school certificate of completion e) Student earned a high school diploma or GED in Spanish DISTANCE LEARNING Online classes can help you make a balance between your busy life and personal goals.

ACADEMIC GRADING SYSTEM AND TRANSCRIPT CODE KEY Official grades and their quality points equivalency at FNU are as shown on the table below . The final grade of a course shall be based on various criteria; however, the individual i nstructor establishes the weight of each assignment for determining the final grade and this information is given in the course syllabus of which every student shall receive a copy. ACADEMIC GRADING SYSTEM and TRANSCRIPT CODE KEY Letter Grade Numerical Value Quality Points Superior Achievement A (90 - 100) 4.00 Very Good B+ (85 - 89) 3.50 Good B (80 - 84) 3.00 Above Average C+ (75 - 79) 2.50 Average C (70 - 74) 2.00 Passing D (60 -69) 1.00 Failure F (0 - 59) 0.00 Satisfactory S ------- Passing gr ade for remedial courses Unsatisfactory U ------- Failure grade for remedial courses Incomplete I Student did not complete the required work for reasons accepted by the instructor. Withdrawal Military WML Withdrawal for military students or their spouse Withdrawal with Penalty WP Withdraws after the add -drop period Withdrawal - no class Participation Module B WX Withdrawal with no class participation on Module B, will not be part of GPA. Audit AU No grades; no quality points. Transferred Credit TC Credit is granted for equivalent course; external or internal transferability. Withdrawal with Failure WF Student did not complete the required class work. Unsatisfactory Withdrawal WU Student did not complete the required class work for remedial courses. TRANSCRIPT CODES Credit by Examination CE Subject to Registrar's authorization. Guided Studies GS Subject to Registrar's authorization. Placement by Testing PT For the ESL programs. FAILURE ( F) An \"F\" is a grade; it counts for the GPA. It alters the completion date of the program; it also increases the student's financial burden. An \"F\" may not be erased, but the course can be repeated to improve the GPA. The latest grade for the course prevails. A student may continue to receive federal financi al aid for any course failed as long as the student is otherwise eligible. In the Associate of Science in Nursing Program and the Associate of Science in Physical Therapist Assistant , the lowest acceptable grade is an 80 % (B). Anything below an 80% is considered failure. INCOMPLETE ( I) Use of this grade is very restricted and only on the basis of extenuating circumstances in the judgment of the instructor. When a student is not able to complete the course requirements within the length of the course 84 for reasons acceptable to the instructor, the instructor may assign an \"Incomplete\" on terms specified by the instructor. An \"I\" is valid for only one TERM ; after this it becomes a n \"F.\" During the waiting period, an \"I\" is listed as credit hours attempted, but not completed. The instructor will prepare a modified final exam or an appropriate assignment and leave it in a sealed envelope with the department head or division head. The department head or division head or an instructor designated by them will p roctor and score the exam in accordance with FNU policy. The same will apply to written papers waiting to be graded as part of a final grade. The instructor may calculate the course average by using \"0\" for each of the components of the final grade that has not been satisfied. (The course syllabus will list the components of the final grade for that course, or the instructor will otherwise stipulate these ). WITHDRAWALS ( WP, WF , WU , WML ) Students desiring to withdraw formally from a class may do so wi thin the add -drop period without penalty. A reduction in course load may keep the student from meeting minimum standards for sa tisfact ory progress . Course withdrawals may also jeopardize the student's financial aid eligibility, VA ben efits, and program completion date. The ADD/DROP period is the first week of the semester (TERM A) ending Thursday of that week. During this time, you are able to add, change, or cancel classes, by following the procedure established. Classes withdrawn within this period will receive be unregistered from the student load. Requests to change, add or cancel classes must be made in writing by means of the Cancel/Add form or the Class Change form found on the FNU website or at the Registrar's Office.

If a student wants to change a class during Term B, it can only be done by substituting the class with another course carrying the same credit load and by paying the $50.00 fee. Please note that all changes carry a $50.00 fee even if it just a change of session. Students starting in the Universi ty in Term B of the semester will be able to ADD /CHANGE classes during the first week of this term (until Thursday of that week) . Late Withdrawal: Any withdrawal after the Add -drop period incurs full financial obligation. The student will receive a \"WP\" if the withdrawal is made between the second week of classes up to the mid -term. \"WP\" does not affect GPA. \"WF\" is assigned after the midterm, when the student does not complete the course requirements. \"WF affects GPA. \"WU\" is assigned after the midterm , when the student does not complete the course requirements for remedial courses. \"WU\" does not affect GPA. 85 WITHDRAWAL FROM THE UNIVERSITY In order to officially withdraw from the University , the students must fill out a Withdrawal Form.

The grade of \"D\" shall transfer and count toward a degree program only for FNU students and/or graduates of an AA or AS. Whether courses with \"D\" grades in the m ajor satisfy requirements in the major field may be decided by the department or division. Grade point averages are not transferred; but courses transferred will appear on the student's transcripts with their respective/earned grades. All tra nsfer of credi t must be made effective at the time of registration or within the student's firs t semester of enrollment . EXPERENTIAL LEARNING CREDITS Experiential learning credits may be transferred to satisfy course requirements.

Credit is awarded based on measurable course learning outcomes presented through a portfolio. CREDIT BY EXAMINATION (CE) Students may receive credit by examination. The Campus Dean will evaluate each case, and the appropriate academi c department will proctor and score the exams. The student will be graded \"S\" if scoring 70% or better, 86 otherwise \"U\". The result of this exam cannot be challenged again. Application forms are available from the Registrar. Institutional credit by examina tion will become a part of the student's permanent record at the con clusion of the semester in which it is awarded; grades will count toward graduation requirements and they will be entered with a CE on the student's transcripts . A fee per credit hour wi ll be charged for each exami nation administered. The maximum number of credits earned by examination will be nine (9). Please be advised that the Federal Pell Grant does not cover credit by examination, just credits earned on the basis of regular class at tendance. This process will be documented in the Academic Summary Sheet inside the student's academic file. Credit by examination may not be used to eliminate an \"F \" or \"I\" grade.

There is no fee for the placement test. REPEATING COURSES Students may repeat courses taken at Florida National University in order to improve the cumulative grade point average. The credit is given for the last grade earned when repeating a course. Repeated courses will appear on the student's transcript. The first attempt will also be shown, but the cumulative grade point average will be computed on the basis of the last attempt only. In the case of repeating a course to improve the GPA, tuition fees will be entirely the student's responsibility. In the evaluation of satisfactory progress, in addition to the minimum credits earned and grade point average each time they are taken, repeated courses will be counted as credits attempted. When successfully com - pleted, they will count as credits earned. A student f ailing a course may still be eligib le for financial aid upon repeating it. The student will seek advice at the Financial Aid office. CHANGING A MAJOR OR PROGRAM A student who wishes to change from one program to another will be thoroughly advised by (a) the registrar (b) the financial aid officer , and (c) the departmental faculties involved for the purpose of making the student fully aware of the best possible use of credits earned, of allocated monies, of necessary changes in the enrollment application , and any other possible implication. All courses taken that can be transferred to the new program, as either required courses or as electives, will be reflected in the student's transcripts, and in in the student's academic file. Students must pay a Registration Fee every time a c hange of major or program occurs. 87 STANDARDS OF ACADEMIC PROGRESS FOR VA STUDENTS Students receiving VA educational benefits must maintain a minimum cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of 2.0 each semester . A VA student whose CGPA falls below 2.0 at the end of any semester will be placed on academic warning for a maximum of two consecutive terms of enrollment. If the VA student's CGPA is still below 2.0 at the end of the second consecutive term on warning, the student's VA educational benefits will be te rminated. A VA student terminated from VA educational benefits due to unsatisfactory progress may petition the school to be recertified after attaining a CGPA of 2.0.

When alerted, occupants of any building within the subject area will lock all doors and window s. Do not allow entry or exit to anyone until the \"all clear\" has been sounded. This procedure converts any building into a large \"safe room.\" The Campus Dean or his/her designee evaluates the situation and takes immediate action to protect life and prope rty. Other University administrators are notified as soon as the situation allows. Students, faculty and staff are alerted via rave, bullhorns, telephones, in -person notification, and/or the University public -address system. TAKE ACTION If you encounter a n intruder who is causing harm or threatening imminent harm to people, seek cover immediately and call 911 (police). Provide as many details as possible, such as location, number of assailants, weapons and any other information you believe will be useful. LOCKDOWN INSTRUCTIONS Never sound the fire alarm to evacuate the building, as everyone should remain inside. If a fire alarm goes off during a lockdown, do not evacuate unless you smell smoke. Be aware of alternate exits if it becomes necessary to flee. L ock yourself in a classroom, resident room, office, etc., as a means of protection. Stay low and away from windows. Barricade door(s) if possible and use furniture or desks as cover. Cover windows or other openings that allow a direct line of sight into th e hallway. Shut the blinds or pull the shades down. Turn the lights off and remain silent. Try to give the impression that the room is empty. Silence cell phones. Turn off the vibrate function. Do not attempt to leave the building until told to do so by se curity or police personnel. If you are outside when a lockdown is announced, enter the nearest building and follow the lockdown instructions above. If you cannot safely enter a building, hide behind a large heavy object (i.e., vehicle or tree) or run away from the hostile activity. If you encounter an active shooter - Get Out, Call 911 and Hide Move quickly - don't wait for others to validate your decision. Leave belongings behind. Survival chances increase the farther you are from the shooter. Call 911 a nd give the operator as much information as possible, including the location, a description of the shooter (and name if known) and the number and type of weapons being used. Do not hang up until told to do so. Hide Out If unable to get out because the shoo ter is between you and the only exit, hide. Try to find a place that is well protected. Avoid places that might trap you or restrict movement. Find a room that can be locked with objects to hide behind. Barricade door with heavy furniture. Turn out lights and remain silent. Silence any device that may create a noise (i.e., cell phones, iPads, etc.). 93 If there are two or more of you, DO NOT huddle together. It gives you options and makes it harder for the shooter. Quietly develop a plan of action in the event the shooter enters. Remain calm. To keep others focused on survival. Assume shooter's intentions are lethal. Attempt only if you believe the shooter will kill or continue killing unless you intervene. Develop a mindset that you have \"what it takes\" to sur vive when your life is on the line. Be prepared to do whatever it takes to neutralize the threat. Throw things, create a distraction or use improvised weapons. Make a plan to overcome the shooter if you see it as the only option. IDENTIFICATION CARDS POLIC Y All persons entering the University premises must display an identification card issued by Florida National University . The identification card is needed for the use of University facilities and services and for voting in Student Government elections. University ID may be worn only by the person whose name appears on the ID. Intentional misuse or alteration of the ID is prohibited . SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY Florida National University is committed to providing an environment that is free of sexual harass ment. Such behavior is illegal under both state and federal law and will not be tolerated. Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, other verbal, nonver bal or physical conduct of a sexual nature or with sexual overtones, and gender -based harassment based on sex or sex-stereotyping. Sexual harassment includes sexual violence, including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking. Sexu al harassment of or by any faculty member, administrator, employee, or student is expressly prohibited. Any person found to violate this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action up to suspension or discharge from the University. Any person who has been sexually harassed should file a complaint using the Title IX Grievance Form which is available online at https://www.fnu.edu/wp -content/uploads/2011/11/Title -IX- Grieva nce-Form.pdf or from the Office of Student Services or Title IX Coordinator(s). Every complaint will be promptly investigated and resolved. Students should refer to the Title IX: Sex- Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures in the Student Handbook for further information found at the following link: -IX-Sex-Based -Discrimination -and-Sexual TITLE IX PROCEDURES Title IX: Sex -Based Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Policies and Procedures Sex Discrimination Prohibited Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (\"Title IX\") is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally assisted education programs or activities. Title IX protects students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and other persons from all forms of sex discrimination, including sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual exploitation, gender -based harassment, stalking, dating violence, domestic violence, and gender identity or failure to conform to stereotypical notions of masculinity or femininity. 94 Florida National University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs and activities. The University prohibits all forms of sex discrimination. Definitions SEXUAL HARRASSMENT: Sexual harassment is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Conduct is unwelcome if the complainant did not request or invite it and regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive; acquiescence in the conduct or failure to complain does not always mean th at the conduct was welcome. Sexual harassment can include unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, other verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature or with sexual overtones, and gender -based harassment based on sex or sex -stereo typing. SEXUAL VIOLENCE: Sexual violence includes dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. DATING VIOLENCE: Dating violence is violence committed by a person who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate n ature with the victim. Dating violence includes, but is not limited to, sexual or physical abuse or the threat of such abuse. Dating violence does not include acts covered under the definition of domestic violence. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE: Domestic violence is a felony or misdemeanor crime of violence committed 1) by a current or former spouse or intimate partner of the victim; 2) by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common; 3) by a person who is cohabitating with, or has cohabitated with, the vict im as a spouse or intimate partner; 4) by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred, or 5) by any other person against an adult or youth vict im who is protected from that person's acts under the domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction in which the crime of violence occurred. The State of Florida defines domestic violence as any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another family or household member. \"Family or household member\" means spouses, former spouses, persons related by blood or marriage, persons who are presently residing together as if a family or who have resided together in the past as if a family, and persons who are parents of a child in common regardless of whether they have been married. With the exception of persons who have a child in common, the family or household members must be currently residing or have in the past resided together in the same single dwelling unit. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 741.28. SEXUAL AS SAULT: Sexual assault is any sexual act directed against another person, without consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent that meets the definition of rape, fondling, incest, or statutory rape. Rape is the penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus, with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim. This offense includes the rape of both males and females. Fondling is the tou ching of the private body parts of another person for the purpose of sexual gratification, without the consent of the victim, including instances where the victim is incapable of giving consent because of his/her age or because of his/her temporary or perm anent mental incapacity. Incest is sexual intercourse between persons who are related to each other within the degrees wherein marriage is prohibited by law. 95 Statutory Rape is sexual intercourse with a person who is under the statutory age of consent. F lorida statutory rape law is violated when a person has consensual sexual intercourse with an individual under age 18. However, there is an exemption for individuals close in age, which allows a person no older than age 23 to engage in consensual sexual in tercourse with minors aged 16 or 17. STALKING: Stalking means engaging in a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to 1) fear for the person's safety or the safety of others or 2) suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two or more acts, including, but not limited to, acts in which the stalker directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or comm unicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person's property. Reasonable person means a reasonable person under similar circumstances and with similar identities to the victim. Substantial emotional distress means significant mental suffering or anguish that may, but does not necessarily, require medical or other professional treatment or counseling. CONSENT: Consent means a clear, unambiguous, and voluntary agreement between the parties engaging in specific sexual activity. A person is incapable of consent when he or she is: 1) mentally disabled; mentally incapacitated; 3) physically helpless or incapacitated; or 4) under threat, coercion or force. The State of Florida defines consent as intelligent, knowing, and voluntary consent, which does no t include coerced submission. \"Consent\" shall not be deemed or construed to mean the failure by the alleged victim to offer physical resistance to the offender. Among other things, the State of Florida does not consider a victim to be able to consent if th e victim is mentally defective, physically incapacitated, or has been administered any narcotic, anesthetic or other intoxicating substance that mentally or physically incapacitates the victim. See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 794.011. Examples of Sexual Harassment The following are examples of behavior may create a hostile environment and could be considered sexual harassment prohibited by Title IX: Requests or demands for sexual favors Unwelcome sexual advances, including touching, kissing, hugging, or massaging Non-consensual sexual activity (where the victim does not consent or is incapable of giving consent) Violence between intimate partners Unnecessary and unwelcome references to various parts of the body Unwelcome statements or conduct related to a person's gend er, actual or perceived sex, gender identity, or nonconformity with sex or gender stereotypes Reoccurring inappropriate or derogatory sexual innuendoes or humor Videotaping and photographing activity of a sexual or personal nature without consent of those being recorded Obscene gestures or nonverbal communication of a sexual or gender -based nature Sexually explicit profanity Use of email, the Internet, text messaging, or other forms of digital media to facilitate any of the above referenced behaviors Sexua l Harassment Prohibited by Title IX Sexual harassment that creates a hostile environment by interfering with, denying or limiting a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the school's program on the basis of sex is prohibited by Title IX. FN U will consider the following factors in determining whether sexual harassment creates a hostile environment: 96 The degree to which the conduct affects one or more students' education; The type, frequency, and duration of the conduct; The identity of and relationship between the respondent and the complainant: The number of individuals involved; The location of the incidents and the context in which they occurred; and Other incidents at the school. This includes quid pro quo sexual harassment, where such advances or requests are made under circumstances implying that one's response or submission to unwanted sexual conduct might affect educational or personnel decisions that are subject to the influence of the person making the proposal. For example, qui d pro quo sexual harassment occurs when submission to sexual harassment is made, either explicitly or implicitly, a term or condition of instruction, employment, or participation in other College activities. Florida National University believes that any f orm of sexual harassment can have a devastating effect upon the people involved and such behavior will not be tolerated. Prompt action will be taken to protect the complainant, investigate the charges, and if warranted, discipline the violator. Such actio n may include suspension or dismissal. Sexual Violence Prevention and Response The University educates the student community about sexual violence prevention through the Office of Student Services. The Office of Student Services provides educational mate rials and conducts prevention and awareness programs for students to promote awareness of, and to prevent sexual violence. Such materials and programs educate students regarding prohibited sexual violence (including relevant definitions), the definition of consent in the state of Florida, safe and positive options for bystander intervention, risk reduction to recognize warning signs of abusive behavior and how to avoid potential attacks, and the University's response to sexual violence (including the comp laint procedures and possible sanctions and protective measures). If you are a victim of sexual violence, first seek safety and then immediate medical attention. The University strongly encourages any victim of sexual violence to report the incident in a timely manner. Time is a critical factor for collecting and preserving of evidence. (Ideally, a victim of sexual violence should not wash, douche, use the restroom, or change clothes prior to a medical examination at a hospital.) The University encourages students to report incidents of sexual violence to the local police department by dialing 911 and to report the incident to the Campus Dean or Title IX Coordinators (who can also assist you with the reporting of an act of sexual violence to the police). The University also strongly advises victims of sexual violence to seek counseling. Local organizations that specialize in crises counseling include: RAINN -Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (800) 656 -4673 Victims of Crimes Services (305) 230 -6141 Opa Locka Domestic Police -Violence Intervention Unit (305) 953 -2838 Baptist Health -Women's Health Center Procedures for Filing a Sexual Harassment Complaint (786) 596 -5981 Any member of the University community who believes that he or she has been a vict im of sexual harassment (the complainant) by a student, a University employee or a third party may bring the matter to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or Deputy Coordinators (collectively, the \"Title IX Coordinators\"). The complainant may also r eport these matters to either of the following employees: Campus Dean. Associate Dean, Assistant Dean, Vice President of Academic Affairs, Student Services Director, Student Services 97 Officer, Student Services Assistant, Athletic Director or Assistant Athle tic Director. It is the responsibility of that individual to file the report with one of the Title IX Coordinators. The complainant should present the complaint as promptly as possible after the alleged harassment occurs using the Title IX Grievance Form which is available online at https://www.fnu.edu/wp - content/uploads/2011/11/Title -IX-Grievance -Form.pdf or from the Office of Student Services or the Title IX Coord inators. Grievance Forms should be submitted directly to one of the Title IX Coordinators or the Director of Student Services. Complainants are encouraged to file complaints promptly because the passage of time typically makes it more difficult to conduct an investigation. Further, it is easier to commence legal proceedings (both civil and criminal) against the accused if the reports are made promptly. If the complainant decides to proceed with a formal complaint, the complainant should submit a written statement to one of the Title IX Coordinators. FNU's Title IX Coordinator will investigate all student complaints of sexual harassment. The Title IX Coordinator will inform the alleged offender (respondent) of the allegation, the identity of the complain ant, the alleged violation of the University's policies, and the date and location of the alleged incident(s). A written statement of the complaint will be given to both parties. Exceptions can be made when confidentiality is requested by the complainant , as described below. Cases involving sexual harassment are particularly sensitive and demand special attention to issues of confidentiality. Dissemination of information relating to the case will be limited in order that the privacy of all individuals i nvolved is safeguarded as fully as possible. Retaliation against the complainant is prohibited. Every effort will be made to protect the complainant from retaliatory action. Resolution of the Complaint The University will promptly take steps to ensure that the complainant and the respondent have equal access to the University's educational programs and activities and to protect the complainant and the respondent as necessary, including taking interim measures before the outcome of an investigation. Inte rim measures are determined on a case -by-case basis and may include counseling, schedule accommodations, academic accommodations, no -contact directives, stay -away letters/campus bans, escorts, limitations on extracurricular or athletic activities, and lea ves of absence. When implementing interim measures, the University will make every effort to avoid depriving any student of his or her education. Reports of alleged Title IX incidents will be investigated in a thorough, impartial, and prompt fashion. The Title IX Coordinator will oversee the collecting of facts related to any reported Title IX incident and will assess whether a further review or investigation is necessary. The Title IX Coordinator will notify and interview complainants, respondents, and witnesses. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will prepare a written report summarizing the relevant exculpatory and inculpatory evidence. Directly following the conclusion of the investigation, the Title IX Coordinator will determine whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy violation occurred. If such reasonable cause exists and the respondent is a student, the Title IX Coordinator will notify University administrators and determine whether to pursue an infor mal or formal resolution, as described below. Where the respondent is a faculty or staff member, the Title IX Coordinator will refer the results of the investigation to the Human Resources Department and the University administrators for appropriate actio n. The Title IX Coordinator will be kept informed of the outcome of the investigation regarding a faculty or staff member and will notify the complainant, as appropriate, of the outcome, including any accommodations the University will provide to the comp lainant. 98 If reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy violation occurred, the Title IX Coordinator believes it is appropriate given the circumstances of the complaint to engage in an informal resolution process, and all parties voluntarily agree to participate in such a process, the Title IX Coordinator will initiate whatever steps he or she deems appropriate to affect an informal resolution of the complaint acceptable to both parties. The complainant or respondent may request to end the informal p rocess at any time to begin the formal stage of the complaint process. If unsatisfied with the informal resolution proposed by the Title IX Coordinator, the complainant or respondent should write a written request to the Title IX Coordinator with his or h er opinions and suggestions, including any request to appear before the Honor Court. If reasonable cause exists to believe that a policy violation occurred and the Title IX Coordinator believes that an informal resolution process is not appropriate based on the nature of the violation, or one or more of the parties requests access to the formal stage of the complaint process, the complaint and the results of the investigation will be forwarded to the Honor Court. Unless the Honor Court concludes that the c omplaint is without merit, the parties to the dispute should be invited to appear before the Honor Court, present any witnesses and evidence, and confront any adverse witnesses. The Honor Court may conduct its own informal inquiry, call witnesses, and gath er whatever information it deems necessary to assist it in reaching a determination as to the merits of the allegations. The parties will be given adequate notice of any hearing before the Honor Court and will be offered equal and meaningful access to inf ormation used during the hearing, including the Title IX Coordinator's report. The parties will also have the opportunity to provide written responses to the Title IX Coordinator's report. The parties may be accompanied at the Honor Court hearing by the advisor of their choice. The advisor may not participate in the hearing, beyond providing guidance to the party being represented. The Honor Court will make findings of fact and conclusions as to whether the facts support a finding of responsibility for violation of the school's policies using a clear and convincing evidence standard. Thus, the Honor Court must determine whether it is more probable than not that the conduct occurred. If the Honor Court determines that it is more probable than not that t he conduct occurred, it should recommend sanctions against the respondent and any additional accommodations for the complainant. The Title IX Coordinator should forward the recommendation immediately to one of the campus deans. The campus dean shall proc eed in the manner set forth by the university's rules and procedures, except that the need for a preliminary review will be precluded. The Honor Court can recommend the following sanctions if it finds that a student has violated this policy: Suspension, E xpulsion, Loss of University Scholarship. The Honor Court can recommend the following accommodations for the complainant: classroom adjustments or changes, academic support (tutoring, mentoring, flexible assignment due dates, allowing the student to make up coursework), allowing the student to retake a course and/or withdraw without penalty, counseling services and protective/no contact orders. Florida National University seeks to resolve all Title IX reports within sixty (60) days but more complex invest igations may require additional time, especially if the matter is brought before the Honor Court. The Title IX Coordinator will notify the complainant and the respondent in writing of the results of the investigation including a summary of the basis for t he determination and the actions that will be taken. Confidentiality The Title IX Coordinator is required to investigate any report of alleged sex and gender based misconduct and to ensure measures are taken to stop adverse behavior and prevent its recur rence, as appropriate. 99 Each report is reviewed individually and it is important to note that not every report leads to a disciplinary process. A student can request confidentiality after making a Title IX report. For example, a complainant may request that his or her name not be disclosed or that an investigation not be conducted regarding the alleged harassment. If the complainant requests confidentiality, the Title IX Coordinator will take all reasonable steps to investigate and respond to the compla int consistent with the student's request. The University will evaluate any confidentiality requests in the context of its responsibility to provide a safe and nondiscriminatory environment for all students. For example, if there have been other similar ac cusations against the same respondent such that the University is concerned about the safety of its students, the University may not be able to respect a request for confidentiality. If the University can honor the complainant's request for confidentialit y, the Title IX Coordinator's ability to investigate the incident could be limited. For example, the University cannot take disciplinary action against the respondent if the complainant requests that his or her name not be revealed. Even when confidential ity is not requested, the University makes every effort to protect the privacy of all individuals involved in such reporting or investigation, yet it cannot always be guaranteed depending on the nature of the incident. Any alleged incidents of sexual viol ence must be reported to the Office of Student Services so they may be included in the University's crime log and the annual security report. Crimes of sexual violence can be reported without disclosing either party's name or any other information that wou ld identify the parties. Complaints involving students are protected under the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) but may be disclosed for legitimate educational purposes within the University. To disclose the information outside of the Univ ersity, any affected students would have to give explicit permission for the information to be shared through the Disclosure of Information Form available at the FNU Publications webpage and at the Office of the Registrar, except as described below. Under FERPA the University does not need student consent to: disclose to the complainant information about the sanction imposed upon a student respondent who was found to have engaged in harassment when the sanction directly relates to the complainant; disclos e to the complainant the final results of a disciplinary proceeding against the respondent, regardless of whether the University concluded that a violation was committed, when the conduct involves a crime of violence or a non -forcible sex offense; and disclose to anyone \u2014not just the complainant \u2014the final results of a disciplinary proceeding if it determines that the student respondent is an alleged perpetrator of a crime of violence or a non -forcible sex offense, and, with respect to the allegation made, th e student has committed a violation of the institution's rules or policies. Medical records are confidential and medical and health professionals are required to maintain confidentiality with regard to the patient's information. Retaliation Retaliation i s prohibited under Title IX against any person who in good faith makes a complaint of sex discrimination, harassment, sexual violence, sexual misconduct, or participates as a witness in a Title IX investigation. The University, the respondent, and the resp ondent's associates may not retaliate against an individual for bringing a complaint or for participating in an investigation. The University will take steps to prevent retaliation against a complainant by the respondent or his or her associates. 100 Conta ct Information for the Title IX Coordinators Reports of alleged sexual harassment by a student, staff or faculty can be filed with any of the following individuals: Florida National University - Title IX Coordinator Bernardo Navarro South Campus Assistan t Dean 11865 SW 26 St Ste.

Th e students' educational records are confidential. A student who is eighteen years old or any student enrolled in a post -secondary program must provide one of the following: (a) written consent to release information to his/her parents, or (b) parental evi dence that said student is a dependent of the parents as defined in Section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code, 1954. The parents no longer have any rights under the Code unless these requirements are met. Other parties will not be able to receive informatio n without the written consent of the student. The student has a right to be informed of any request for information concerning his/her files, according to Statute 20, United States Code, section 123g and regulations adopted pursuant thereto (and thereafte r referred to as Code). A copy of the entire Code can be obtained in the Office of the Director of Student Services or at any Campus Dean's office. Under the Code, FNU has established a classification of student information referred to as \"directory information.\" This \"directory information\" will be made available to persons on request based on availability of access. Florida National University has established the following data as \"directory information.\" 1. Student's full name 4. Participation in st udent organizations 2. Sex 5. Dates of attendance (start and withdrawal dates) 3. Career major 6. Degree and awards received Other information will only be available to the student and certain staff members of FNU who need it for completing thei r work in regards to the student, and otherwise only to parents or guardian. Such data includes: 1. Health and medical records 4. Student or family financial income 2. Disciplinary records 5. Student placement records 3. Personal counseling records 6. Other personal, identifiable information The Records Custodian of Florida National University may release information from these records only upon authorization in writing from the student or in case of subpoena by the court or when needed by the President of FNU in completing his official responsibilities within the limits of the law when mandated by state board regulations, or board policies. The student has the right, upon informing the Registrar's Office in writing, to withhold personal directory i nformation from publication or release. 102 Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System Courses in this catalog are identified by prefixes and numbers that were assigned by Florida's Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). This numbering system is use d by all public postsecondary institutions in Florida and by participating nonpublic institutions. The major purpose of this system is to facilitate the transfer of courses between participating institutions. Students and administrators can use the onlin e SCNS to obtain course descriptions and specific information about course transfer between participating Florida institutions. This information is at the SCNS website at http://scns.fldoe.org . Each participating institution controls the title, credit, and content of its own courses and recommends the first digit of the course number to indicate the level at which students normally take the course. Course prefixes and the last three digits of the course numbers are assigned by members of faculty discipl ine committees appointed for that purpose by the Florida Department of Education in Tallahassee. Individuals nominated to serve on these committees are selected to maintain a representative balance as to type of institution and discipline field or special ization. The course prefix and each digit in the course number have a meaning in the SCNS. The listing of prefixes and associated courses is referred to as the \"SCNS taxonomy.\" Descriptions of the content of courses are referred to as \"statewide course profiles.\" Example of Course Identifier Prefix Level Code Century Digit Decade Digit Unit Digit Lab Code (first digit) (second digit) (third digit) (fourth digit) ENC 1 1 0 1 English Lower (Freshman) Freshman Freshman Freshman No laboratory Com position Level at this Composition Composition Composition component in institution Skills Skills I this course General Rule for Course Equivalencies Equivalent courses at different institutions are identified by the same prefixes and same last thre e digits of the course number and are guaranteed to be transferable between participating institutions that offer the course, with a few exceptions, as listed below in Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency . For example, a freshman composition sk ills course is offered by 84 different public and nonpublic postsecondary institutions. Each institution uses \"ENC_101\" to identify its freshman composition skills course. The level code is the first digit and represents the year in which students normal ly take the course at a specific institution. In the SCNS taxonomy, \"ENC\" means \"English Composition,\" the the decade digit \"0\" represents \"Freshman Composition Skills,\" and the unit digit \"1\" represent s \"Freshman Composition Skills I.\" In the sciences and certain other areas, a \"C\" or \"L\" after the course number is known as a lab indicator. The \"C\" represents a combined lecture and laboratory course that meets in the same place at the same time. The \"L\" represents a laboratory course or the laboratory part of a course that has the same prefix and course number but meets at a different time or place. Transfer of any successfully completed course from one participating institution to another is guaranteed in cases where the course to be transferred is equivalent to one offered by the receiving institution. Equivalencies are established by the same prefix and last three digits and comparable faculty credentials at both institutions. For example, EN C 1101 is offered at a community college. The same course is offered at a state university as ENC 2101. A student who has successfully completed ENC 1101 at a Florida College System institution is guaranteed to receive transfer credit for ENC 2101 at the state 103 university if the student transfers. The student cannot be required to take ENC 2101 again since ENC 1101 is equivalent to ENC 2101. Transfer credit must be awarded for successfully completed equivalent courses and used by the receiving institutio n to determine satisfaction of requirements by transfer students on the same basis as credit awarded to the native students. It is the prerogative of the receiving institution, however, to offer transfer credit for courses successfully completed that have not been designated as equivalent. NOTE : Credit generated at institutions on the quarter -term system may not transfer the equivalent number of credits to institutions on the semester -term system. For example, 4.0 quarter hours often transfers as 2.67 seme ster hours. The Course Prefix The course prefix is a three -letter designator for a major division of an academic discipline, subject matter area, or subcategory of knowledge. The prefix is not intended to identify the department in which a course is off ered. Rather, the content of a course determines the assigned prefix to identify the course. Authority for Acceptance of Equivalent Courses Section 1007.24(7), Florida Statutes, states: Any student who transfers among postsecondary institutions that are fully accredited by a regional or national accrediting agency recognized by the United States Department of Education and that participate in the statewide course numbering system shall be awarded credit by the receiving institution for courses satisfacto rily completed by the student at the previous institutions. Credit shall be awarded if the courses are judged by the appropriate statewide course numbering system faculty committees representing school districts, public postsecondary educational institutio ns, and participating nonpublic postsecondary educational institutions to be academically equivalent to courses offered at the receiving institution, including equivalency of faculty credentials, regardless of the public or nonpublic control of the previou s institution. The Department of Education shall ensure that credits to be accepted by a receiving institution are generated in courses for which the faculty possess credentials that are comparable to those required by the accrediting association of the re ceiving institution. The award of credit may be limited to courses that are entered in the statewide course numbering system. Credits awarded pursuant to this subsection shall satisfy institutional requirements on the same basis as credits awarded to nativ e students. Exceptions to the General Rule for Equivalency Since the initial implementation of the SCNS, specific disciplines or types of courses have been excepted from the guarantee of transfer for equivalent courses. These include courses that must be evaluated individually or courses in which the student must be evaluated for mastery of skill and technique. The following courses are exceptions to the general rule for course equivalencies and may not transfer. Transferability is at the discretion of the receiving institution. A. Courses not offered by the receiving institution. B. For courses at nonregionally accredited institutions, courses offered prior to the established transfer date of the course in question. C. Courses in the _900 -999 series are not automatically transferable, and must be evaluated individually. These include such courses as Special Topics, Internships, Apprenticeships, Practica, Study Abroad, Theses, and Dissertations. D. Applied academics for adult education courses. E. Graduate courses.

We believe that safe nursing ca re derives from critical thinking skills, good judgment applied to knowledge and clinical expertise. We believe that the Bachelor of Science in Nursing continues the high standards of integrity and ethics for students, professors, administrators and sta ff set by the institution for all of its programs. We believe that every student is unique and deserves the individual support and guidance necessary to be successful. We believe that the registered nurse functions as an important part of the health care team within the limits of the scope of practice of the profession. We believe that an understanding of the dependent role of the registered nurse and the scope of practice is a key element of the success of the nursing graduate. 144 Physical Therapis t Assistant (PTA), Bachelor of Science Degree The Bachelor of Science Degree in Physical Therapist Assistant (PTA) is designed to prepare graduates for additional career opportunities and advancement within the profession.
