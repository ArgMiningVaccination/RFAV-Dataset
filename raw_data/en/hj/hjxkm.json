The Covid-19 vaccines do not have full FDA approval. They are authorized under Emergency Use Only, making them an experimental drug. It is everyone's right to be able to deny an experimental drug. 2. The coronavirus has roughly a 99.9% survival rate among the general population but affects the college- aged demographic even less. 3.

Requiring students to show proof of vaccination could also be interpreted as a violation of HIPAA laws and medical privacy, as well as the privacy and equal treatment under the law guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. 4. This study completed by Pfizer ( ) reveals there is no significant difference in catching and being affected by COVID-19 between the vaccinated and placebo groups.

All vaccines that are currently required in order to attend the university are fully FDA approved, unlike the coronavirus vaccine. 2. The currently required vaccines have been available for many years and have had long- term studies conducted on them to evaluate their safety, efficacy, and side effects. 3. All other required vaccines are what is called a \"live attenuated virus\". This is a weakened or dead form of the live virus in the vaccine so your immune system learns how to make the antibodies to defend itself against the illness. However the coronavirus vaccine is not a live attenuated virus vaccine but an mRNA vaccine which bypasses the traditional system and has never been successful or used until now. 4. The adverse effects and deaths reported for the other required vaccines are much lowe r than those for the coronavirus vaccines. 5. The death rates for the diseases for other required vaccines are much higher and more of a threat "}
