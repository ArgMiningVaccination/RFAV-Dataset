.......................................................................................... 257 This Scope of Work is part of a Contract to provide statewide, risk -based managed care services to Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in the State of Indiana's [MLTSS Program Name] program. The State is soliciting proposals from proven managed care entities (MCEs) to coordinate and provide member -driven, accessible, equitable and high- quality services to eligible Medicaid members for medical, behavioral, and long-term services and supports. Because [MLTSS Program Name] is financed in part by federal Medicaid funds, Contractors shall meet all applicable requirements of Medicaid managed care organizations under Section 1903(m) and 1932 of the Social Security Act, as well as the implementing regulations set forth in 42 CFR 438, which defines requirements for Medicaid managed care programs. Contractors shall also ensure that its network providers, including out -of-state providers, enroll in the Indiana Health Coverage Programs (IHCP) before they begin providing health care services to members. Further information about IHCP provider enrollment is located at: https://www.in.gov/medicaid/providers/provider -enrollment/become-a- provider/ Unless otherwise indicated, the requirements set forth in this Scope of Work apply to the Contractor's responsibilities under the [MLTSS Program Name] program. Definitions for terms cited throughout the Scope of Work are listed in Exhibit 6 unless otherwise specified. 1.0 Background The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration (FSSA) manages the [MLTSS Program Name] program, which will serve approximately 106,000 1 Hoosiers. [MLTSS Program Name] is a statewide coordinated care program for Indiana's Medicaid enrollees who are 60 years of age and older and are eligible for Medicaid on the basis of age, blindness, or disability and have limited income and resources. All individuals who are 60 years of age or older in the target eligibility categories will be included unless they meet an exclusion, as specified in Exhibit 3. Enrollees include members who have a full Medicare benefit, those in a nursing facility, and those who are receiving long- term services and supports (LTSS) in a home or community -based setting. The State is interested in contracting with MCEs that can perform the administrative functions of a typical insurer, can support members in strategies to address complex and chronic health conditions of the program population which includes many individuals with complex health conditions who are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid and/or receive LTSS, and can manage and integrate care along the continuum and settings of LTSS in Indiana. 1 The enrollment figures provided in this Scope of Work are current figures only. Enrollment in the [MLTSS Program Name] program may increase or decrease in the future based upon federal policies, program priorities, available funding, etc. 13 In developing [MLTSS Program Name], FSSA seeks to achieve the following: Ensure more Hoosiers can choose to age at home and simplify access to Home and Community -Based Services (HCBS) Appropriately divert individuals from long- term nursing facility stays in accordance with a person- centered approach. Through high -quality care coordination, coordinated care across the delivery system and care continuum, including across Medicaid and Medicare for dually eligible members , and taking into account physical health, behavioral health, and social services Improve quality outc omes and consistency of care across the delivery system Provide person- centered and strengths -based care Ensure member choice, protections, and access Promote caregiver support and skill development Emphasize communication, training, and collaboration with network providers to ease administrative burden and help accomplish program goals Align incentives across the delivery system with improved health and quality of life outcomes Deliver cost -effective and accountable coverage Leverage data to make informed program and care decisions Understand, measure, and address health inequities in care and access Promote primary and preventive care Ensure the appropriate use of health care services Develop informed health care consumers by increasing health literacy and providing price and quality transparency of members and their informal caregivers Encourage quality, continuity, and appropriateness of medical care Develop innovative member and provider incentives Develop innovative utilization management techniques that incorporate member and provider education to facilitate the right care, at the right time, in the right location Engage in provider and member outreach regarding preventive care, wellness , and a holistic approach Expand the HCBS provider network, especially in rural areas . The Contractor shall ensure that they follow all program requirements and guidance issued by the State including but not limited to the [MLTSS Program Name] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual as updated and amended periodically. 1.1 [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals The Contractor shall be required to help lead the transformation of our Medicaid LTSS delivery system and to collaborate with the State and other [MLTSS Program Name] MCEs to achieve this mis sion. The contractor shall abide by the requirements further detailed in Section 7 .0 Quality Improvement. The State has established three overarching Program Quality Goals for the [MLTSS Program Name] program: 14 The State wants to encourage ongoing investment and achieve lasting progress, therefore FSSA is committed to maintaining these goals for the first contract term and potential contract term extension years of the [MLTSS Program Name] program. For each goal, FSSA will establish focus areas, objectives , and performance targets which will evolve over time to reflect the maturation of the [MLTSS Program Name] program and MCEs. The Contractor will be expected to develop and accomplish annual workplans and make investments toward improved outcomes. Measures associated with certain objectives will also be identified as Pay for Outcomes measures, and the Contractors' performance on all quality goals will be shared publicly . The [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals were developed with broad input from Indiana stakeholders - including members and member advocates - and are reflective of national best practices. These goals will also build a strong foundation for Indiana to effectively deliver and finance [MLTSS Program Name] program services, provide the best value to program members and Hoosier taxpayers, and produce improved program outcomes. The State believes that achieving these goals will be a win-win for all involved parties : For members , who will have increased choice and access to services as well as increased control over their services and supports; For providers, who will have clear, consistent messaging about program priorities and technical assistance and training to help them deliver services and supports in a manner that supports those priorities; and For MCEs, who will, through collaborative and aligned efforts, be able to more effectively support provider and member behavior change to achieve improved results. MCE Investmen ts in Quality These overarching [MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals reflect the State's highest priorities. As such, FSSA intends to award contracts to Contractors that offer innovative and evidence -based approaches in meeting these [MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals. The State expects Contractors to align their resources toward achieving improvement in these goal areas. For example: Member and provider outreach and education efforts should support the goals In lieu of services and enhanced services offered by the MCE should be carefully selected to support these goals Member and provider incentives and Value- Based Purchasing arrangements should be designed to support these goals The Contractor will be required to actively collaborate with the State and other [MLTSS Program Name] Contractors to design and implement initiatives and interventions that support these goals. This collaboration will be achieved through participation in formal committees and workgroups facilitated by the State, as well as by the execution of common strategies across MCEs. MCEs will be expected to share insights and best practices and to actively participate in and contribute to these quality improvement activities. Focus Areas for Future Years FSSA [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals Goal 1: Person -Centered Services and Supports - Develop service plans and deliver services in a manner that is person- centered, participant -driven, holistic, involves caregivers, and addresses SDOH. Goal 2: Ensuring Smooth Transitions - Ensure continuity of care and seamless experiences for participants as they transition into the [ MLTSS Program Name] program or among providers, settings, or coverage types. Goal 3: Access to Services ( Member Choice) - Assure timely access to appropriate services and supports to enable participants to live in their setting of choice and promote their well- being and quality of life. 15 Member experience is an important component of our initial focus and will continue to be in future years, because member experiences serve as an important indicator of the quality of services provided by the MCEs. Examples of other focus areas (not listed in order of priority) to support the [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals, that were suggested by stakeholders for possible inclusion in future years: Person -Centered Services and Supports Possib le Future Focus Areas: Coordination between Medicaid MCE and D -SNPs/other Medicare plans; Member goal attainment (LTSS and non- LTSS); Advance care planning and palliative care Ensuring Smooth Transitions Possible Future Focus Areas: Transitions among settings (Hospital, NF, HCBS); Transitions between MCEs/Medicare health plans; Members newly eligible for Medicare; Transitions from nursing facility to HCBS (when chosen by the member); Use of Event Notification System; Medicare- Medicaid Care Coordination; Completeness and accuracy of options counseling (Transitions into LTSS) Access to Services ( Member Choice) Possible Future Focus Areas: Direct service worker workforce initiatives; Home Health nursing workforce initiatives ; Timely member access to HCBS; Availability of Informal Caregiver Supports; Connections with social loop referrals; HCBS Utilization; Potentially Preventable Events and/or Adult Core Measures (as an indicator of access to preventive care); Primary care visits; Community inclusion; Healthy Days at Home; Loneliness Initial Objectives for [ MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals To actively support the [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals, we have developed measurable objectives and performance targets that each of the MCEs will be required to meet. Certain objectives have been designated as Pay for Outcomes measures. For those measures, higher incentive payments will be made to MCEs that reach targets above the benchmarks identified in the Pay for Outcomes in Exhibit 2. These initial focus areas and objectives were designed to focus on building infrastructure that will enable the State to more effectively manage and deliver care and services in future years. Thus, the initial objectives largely rely on structural and process measures. 2.0 Administrative Requirements 2.1 Eligibility Requirements The State has sole authority for determining whether individuals meet the eligibility criteria of the [MLTSS Program N ame] program. The FSSA Division of Family Resources (DFR) makes eligibility determinations based on federal and state policy as interpreted by OMPP. Nursing Facility Level of care is determined based on state law and administrative rule. Age and Target Group In order to be eligible to enroll in an MCE, an individual must be in the age and target groups served by the MCE as specified below. Medicaid Eligibility The population for this program is individuals 60 and older who are eligible for Medicaid on the bas is of age, blindness, or disability and have limited income and resources. All members aged 60 and older in the target eligibility categories will be included unless the individual meets an exclusion. This includes members who have a full Medicare benefit and those in a nursing facility. Included Individuals aged 60 years of age or over who are enrolled in Medicaid based on eligibility as: 16 Aged (MA A) Blind (MA B) Disabled (MA D) SSI recipients (MASI) MED the A&D waiver -In a years age on the A&D waiver -DDRS Waiver Recipients -PACE Members -Room and Board RCAP members -ESRD 1115 members -Breast and Cervical Cancer Eligible members (MA 12) -TBI Waiver Recipients -TBI Out of State Placements -ICF/IDD residents -Emergency Services Only Members -Family Planning Only Members -HIP members with MAGI eligibility -HHW members with MAGI eligibility -Registered members of a federally -recognized Tribe who are eligible for HIP but have opted out into FFS coverage (MANA) Functional Eligibility Functional eligibility is determined using the InterRAI assessment. o In order to be functionally eligible for Long- Term Services and Supports an otherwise eligible individual must have a nursing facility level of care as determined by the InterRAI assessment and meet the requirements under Indiana Code 12- 10-11.5- 4. This level of care will be completed by an Enrollment Contractor selected by FSSA. Managed Care Entities will not determine the member's level of care. For nursing facility admittance only, if the individual is reasonably expected to no longer meet nursing facility level of care within a time period of 30, 60, 90, or 120 days the nursing facility level of care must be reassessed in that respective time period. Additionally, for anyone receiving LTSS, the nursing facility level of care must be reassessed at least annually. The benefit package available to members is identified in Exhibit 3 Covered Benefits. Residency To be eligible for [ MLTSS program name], an otherwise eligible individual must be a resident, as determined by DFR using rules found in the Indiana Health Coverage Policy & Program Manual For individuals who come into the program with no current Medicaid coverage, MCE 17 assignment will be effective on the date of eligibility approval. Medicaid coverage may be effective up to three (3) months retroactively from their application date. Retroact ive coverage will be in the fee for service (FFS) program, the managed care assignment will not be retroactive. Individuals transitioning from an existing Medicaid Managed Care program or FFS, MCE assignment will be effective the first day of the month following the notice of change in eligibility. Plan selection can be made on the IHCP application or by calling the enrollment broker within sixty ( 60) days of coverage start. If a member does not select a plan there will be an assignment process in place directed by the State. Plan assignment will favor plan alignment between Medicare and Medicaid to the greatest extent allowable. Other factors may be considered such as the residential provider of the member (if applicable). Individuals will have the chance to change a health plan: 1) within sixty ( 60) days of starting coverage, 2) at any time their Medicare and Medicaid plans become unaligned (e.g. member disenrolls from one MA plan to another during quarterly Special Enrollment Period (SEP), 3) once per calendar year for any reason, 4) at any time using the just cause process; and 5) Additionally, during a plan selection period which will be aligned with the Medicare open enrollment window (mid- October to mid- December) to be effective the following calendar year. Medicare Election o To enroll, a prospective member who is eligible for Medicare must: Enroll in and remain enrolled in all parts of Medicare for which the prospective member is eligible (Medicare Part A, Part B , and/or Part D); or Obtain all Medicare Part A, Part B, and Part D benefits, if eligible, from the MCE's Special Needs Plan. o If a member becomes Medicare- eligible after enrollment, the member must enroll in all parts of Medicare for which the member is eligible. 2.1.1 Eligibility Determination Process 1. Eligibility Determination Prior to Initial Enrollment a. The Contractor will assure the Contractor's separation from the FSSA initial eligibility determination and enrollment counseling functions. The separation shall meet criteria established by the State in accordance with applicable federal and state guidelines. b. Contractors may market directly to members or potential members only in accordance with a marketing plan that has been approved by the State and may use only marketing materials that have been approved by the State. 2. Functional Eligibility Re -determination Once enrolled, the Contractor is responsible to assure that all members have a current and accurate level of care as determined by the InterRAI, in accordance with Section 2.1. 2 Long- Term Care Functional Screen. This includes at minimum an annual re- determination of level of care. It may also include a post -enrollment re- determination shortly after enrollment or a re- determination necessitated by a change in the member's condition. The Contractor shall not complete the level of care determination, but work with the FSSA 18 Enrollment Contractor and member to have the level of care determined annually and when a change in the member's condition occurs. 3. Supporting Members to Maintain Medicaid Eligibility The Contractor is responsible for supporting members with maintaining Medicaid eligibility. This includes but is not limited to: a. Reminding members of the required annual Medicaid recertification procedure and coordinating member transportation to any needed DFR appointments; b. Educate members on any applicable Medicaid income and asset limits and as appropriate and needed, supporting members to meet verification requirements; c. Educate members on any deductible, cost share, patient or waiver liability obligation, or transfer penalty period they may need to meet to maintain Medicaid eligibility; d. If appropriate and needed, supporting members to obtain a representative payee or legal decision maker; and e. Referring and connecting members as needed to other available resources in the community that may assist members in obtaining or maintaining eligibility such as Elder and Disability Benefits Specialists and advocacy organizations. 4. Providing Information that May Affect Eligibility Members have a responsibility to report certain changes in circumstances that may affect Medicaid eligibility to DFR within ten (10) calendar days of the change. The Contractor is expected to be knowledgeable of eligibility criteria and educate members in reporting known changes to the DFR. Notwithstanding the member's reporting obligations, if the Contractor has information about a change in member circumstances that may affect Medicaid eligibility, the Contractor is to provide that information to DFR as soon as possible but in no event more than ten (10) calendar days from the date of discovery (see Section 5.2 Member Enrollment and Contractor Selection). Members who receive SSI benefits are required to report certain changes to the Social Security Adminis tration rather than DFR. The Contractor shall support members in meeting these reporting requirements since loss of SSI has a direct impact on Medicaid eligibility. Reportable information includes: An initial LOC determination that qualifies an individual for additional LTSS services or a change in a member' s LO C; The member has died; The member has been incarcerated; The member has a verified move either within the state or to another state; Any known changes in the member's income or assets; Changes in the member's marital status. 5. Medicare Coverage Electio ns The Contractor is responsible for having the requisite staff knowledge and resources to support members in effectively understanding any Medicare coverage choices, including traditional Medicare, Medicare Advantage (non- special needs plans), and Special Needs Plans (SNPs) as well as all relevant Medicare enrollment periods, including the Open Enrollment Period (OEP) and Special Enrollment Periods (SEPs) in order to avoid unintended misalignment or even potential disenrollment from the program. 6. Waiver or Patient Liability 19 The Contractor is responsible for the ongoing monitoring of the waiver or patient liability amounts of its members. The Contractor is to receive and monitor medical claim amounts and apply allowable costs against the liability to ensure member responsibility is met; and to cover allowable costs after the liability is met. Members may be required to pay a monthly waiver or patient liability in order to be eligible for [MLTSS Program N ame]. Liability is the term applied to the monetary amount that IHCP members in long- term care (HCBS or nursing facility) must contribute toward their monthly care. a. Waiver liability is similar to a deductible and applies to members who live in the community (such as their own home, an adult family home, a community -based residential facility or a residential care apartment complex). Waiver members will be allowed to keep a monthly personal needs allowance (PNA) equivalent to the current year's special income limit amount (SIL, as specified by 405 IAC 2- 1.1-1(g)). No claims are reimbursable until the waiver liability has been met. For waiver members with a waiver liability assigned, the Contractor must provide a system to track Medicaid- allowable expenses; when such expenses exceed the waiver liability amount, they should be paid by the Contractor. The provider should be able to see the waiver liability obligation and balance in the portal or when checking eligibility. Monthly waiver liability summary notices must be sent to the member and any authorized representative. The notice must detail the services and amounts applied to the waiver liability. With the exception of pharmacy claims, the member is not required to pay the provider until the expense has been included in the waiver liability summary notice. It is the member's responsibility to supply verification of medical expenses not allowed for payment by Medicare or Medicaid to the DFR for possible deduction in the initial liability assignment calculation. The Contractor must also establish systems and procedures to properly apply Medicare Crossover Payments to waiver liability according to Indiana Health Coverage Programs guidance regarding third- party liability. For members with waiver liability who have not met their liability for the month, Medicare crossover claims credit the waiver liability with the combined sum of the amounts shown as the coinsurance or copayment, blood deductible, and deductible. The billed amount of a crossover claim cannot be used to credit waiver liability. The coinsurance or copayment and deductible amounts for Medicare Part A claims are prorated, based on the number of days billed. Medicare Part B claims spanning more than 1 month are credited to the month of the first date of service. Coinsurance or copayment and deductible amounts on crossover claims for members who have only Qualified Medicare Beneficiary coverage (QMB - Only) do not credit waiver liability Patient liability applies to members who reside in a nursing home or Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF - IID) for 30 or more consecutive days or are likely to reside there for 30 or more consecutive days. The personal needs allowance for this group is $52 monthly plus, if applicable, veterans' pensions; as specified in IC 12-15-7- 2. State Plan services can be paid without regard to whether the patient liability has been met. 20 Patient liability amounts are to be deducted from the total reimbursement of monthly claims to the facility. Providers are not to indicate or exclude the liability when submitting claims. The patient liability amount should be visible in the provider portal or when the provider checks eligibility. When a member transfers between facilities during a billing period, the member liability is deducted from the first claim received and processed by the MCE. Therefore, the facilities involved in the transfer must coordinate any liability deductions. DFR is responsible for determining the amount of a member's waiver or patient liability. Waiver liability is imposed on members in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.726. Patient liability is imposed in accordance with 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.725. Member information, including waiver/patient reflected in the MMIS, is updated daily from the information relayed by the eligibility and enrollment system and will be communicated to the appropriate MCE. Liability amounts will not change in the middle of a month. The Contractor should be knowledgeable and able to answer questions on liabilities and provide current information to members who contact them with questions. 7. Transfer of Property Penalties DFR will determine if an applicant or member for LTSS Medicaid has inappropriately transferred assets without adequate consideration in order to qualify for Medicaid, as specified in 405 IAC 2-3- 1.1. A monthly \"facility rate\" will be set by the state annually, and the transfer penalty period will be equal to the amount of the disallowed transfer divided by the facility rate to arrive at the number of months of penalty. The dates of any penalty period will be communicated to the Contractor from the MMIS system. During a penalty period, LTSS services above the member's State Plan benefits are not payable by Medicaid. Provider portal and eligibility -checking systems must indicate to providers the start and end dates of member ineligibility due to transfer of property penalty. Transfer of property penalties will always start on the first day of a month but can end on any day of a month. a. The Contractor should be knowledgeable and able to answer questions on transfer of property penalties and provide information to members who contact them with questions. 2.1.2 Long- Term Care Functional Screen Functional Screen Tool and Database The tool used for determining level of care is the InterRAI -HC assessment. Notification of Changes in Functional Eligibility Criteria The State will notify the Contractor of any changes in administrative code requirements related to functional eligibility, including, but not limited to, code changes that result in changes to determining functional eligibility for the programs. 2.2 State Licensure Prior to the Contract effective date, and as verified in the readiness review, the Contractor must be: 1.

Authorized representatives or agents of the State and the federal government shall have access to the Contractor's accounting records and the accounting records of its subcontractors upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times during the performance and/or retention period of the Contract for purposes of review, analysis, inspection, audit and/or reproduction. In addition, the Contractor shall file with the State Insurance Commissioner the financial and other information required by the IDOI. Copies of any accounting records pertaining to the Contract shall be made available by the Contractor within ten (10) calendar days of receiving a written request from the State for specified records. If such original documentation is not made available as requested, the Contractor shall provide transportation, lodging, and subsistence at no cost, for all state and/or federal representatives to carry out their audit functions at the principal offices of the Contractor or other locations of such records. FSSA, IDOI, OMPP , and other state and federal agencies and their respective authorized representatives or agents shall have access to all accounting and financial records of any individual, partnership, firm or corporation insofar as they relate to transactions with any department, board, commission, institution or other state or federal agency connected with the Contract. The Contractor shall maintain financial records pertaining to the Contract, including all claims records, for three (3) years following the end of the federal fiscal year during which the Contract is terminated, or when all state and federal audits of the Contract have been completed, whichever is later, in accordance with 45 CFR 74.53, which sets retention and access requirements for 37 records. Financial records should address matters of ownership, organization , and operation of the Contractor's financial, medical and other record keeping systems. However, accounting records pertaining to the Contract shall be retained until final resolution of all pending audit questions and for one (1) year following the termination of any litigation relating to the Contract if the litigation has not terminated within the three (3) year period. In addition, FSSA requires Contractors to produce the following financial information, upon request: o Tangible Net Equity (TNE) or Risk Based Capital at balance sheet date o Cash and Cash Equivalents o Claims payment, IBNR, reimbursement, fee for service claims, provider contracts by line of business o Appropriate insurance coverage for medical malpractice, general liability, property, workers' compensation and fidelity bond, in conformance with state and federal regulations o Revenue Sufficiency by line of business/group o Renewal Rates or Proposed Rates by line of business o Corrective Action Plan Documentation and Implementation o Financial, Cash Flow , and Medical Expense Projections by line of business o Underwriting Plan and Policy by line of business o Premium Receivable Analysis by line of business o Affiliate and Inter -company Receivables o Current Liability Payables by line of business o Medical Liabilities by line of business o Copies of any correspondence to and from the IDOI 2.7.5 Reporting Transactions with Parties of Interest Any Contractor that is not a federally qualified HMO (as defined in Section 1310(d) of the Public Health Servic e Act) shall disclose to FSSA information on certain types of transactions they have with a \"party in interest,\" as defined in the Public Health Service Act. (See \u00a7\u00a71903(m)(2)(A)(viii) and 1903(m)(4) of the Social Security Act.) For purposes of this Scope of Work, the following reporting requirements will apply to all Contractors in the same manner that they apply to federally qualified HMOs under the Public Health Service Act. Definition of a Party in Interest -- As defined in \u00a71318(b) of the Public Health Service Act, a party in interest is: Any director, officer, partner or employee responsible for management or administration of an HMO; any person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than five percent (5%) of the equity of the HMO; any person who is the beneficial owner of a mortgage, deed of 38 trust, note or other interest secured by, and valuing more than five percent (5%) of the HMO; and, in the case of an HMO organized as a nonprofit corporation, an incorporator or member of such corporation under applicable state corporation law; Any entity in which a person described in the paragraph above is a director or officer; is a partner; has directly or indirectly a beneficial interest of more than five percent (5%) of the equity of the HMO; or has a mortgage, deed of trust, note or other interest valuing more than five percent (5%) of the assets of the HMO; Any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with an HMO; and Any spouse, child, or parent of an individual described above. Types of Transactions Which Shall Be Disclosed - Business transactions which shall be disclosed include: Any sale, exchange , or lease of any property between the HMO and a party in interest; Any lending of money or other extension of credit between the HMO and a party in interest; and Any furnishing for consideration of goods, services (including management services) or facilities between the HMO and the party in interest. This does not include salaries paid to employees for services provided in the normal course of their employment. The information which must be disclosed in the transactions between the Contractor and a party in interest listed above includes: The name of the party in interest for each transaction; A description of each transaction and the quantity or units involved; The accrued dollar value of each transaction during the fiscal year; and Justification of the reasonableness of each transaction. In addition to the above information on business transactions, the Contractor may be required to submit a consolidated financial statement for the Contractor and the party in interest. If the Contract is an initial contract with FSSA, but the Contractor has operated previously in commercial or Medicare markets, information on business transactions for the entire year preceding the initial contract period shall be disclosed within thirty ( 30) days of the initial contract start date. If the Contract is being renewed or extended, the Contractor shall disclose information on business transactions which occurred during the prior contract period within thirty ( 30) days of the end of each contract year. The business transactions which shall be reported are not limited to transactions related to serving the Medicaid enrollment, that is, all of the Contractor's business transactions shall be reported. 2.7.6 Compensation The method of compensation under this Contract will be capitation payments and payments from liable third parties, as specified and defined within this Contract, and appropriate laws, regulations, and policies [42 CFR 438.6(b)(1)]. The Contractor will be paid a capitation for all prospective coverage member months, including partial member months as described in Exhibit 39 5. Final capitation rates are identified and developed, and payment is made in accordance with 42 CFR 438.3(c). Subject to the availability of funds, payments shall be made to the Contractor in accordance with the terms of this Contract provided that the Contractor's performance is compliant with the terms and conditions of this Contract. The State reserves the option to make payments to the Contractor by wire or National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) transfer and will provide the Contractor at least thirty ( 30) days' notice prior to the effective date of any such change. Where payments are made by electronic funds transfer, Indiana shall not be liable for any error or delay in transfer, nor indirect or consequential damages arising from the use of the electronic funds transfer process. Any charges or expenses imposed by the bank for transfers or related actions shall be borne by the Contractor. An error discovered by the State, with or without an audit, in the amount of fees paid to the Contractor will be subject to adjustment or repayment via a recoupment from future payment(s) to the Contractor, or by making an additional payment to the Contractor. When the Contractor identifies an overpayment, FSSA must be notified and reimbursed within thir ty (30) days of identification [42 CFR 438.608(c)(3)]. No payment due to the Contractor by the State may be assigned or pledged by the Contractor. This section shall not prohibit the State at its sole option from making payment to a fiscal agent hired by the Contractor. The Contractor will be denied payment for newly enrolled members when, and for so long as, payment for those members is denied by CMS under 42 CFR 438.730(e) [42 4 38.730(e)(1)(ii), Section 1903(m)(5)(B)(ii) of the Social Security Act]. All funds received by the Contractor pursuant to this Contract shall be separately accounted for in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Contractor shall develop and maintain internal controls and systems to separately account for both [MLTSS P rogram Name] - related revenue and expenses and non- [MLTSS Program N ame] -related revenue and expenses by type and develop and maintain internal controls to prevent and detect fraud, waste , and program abuse. The Contractor shall separately account for all funds received under this Contract as required in the MCE Reporting Manual. [42 CFR 438.3(m)]. 2.7.6.1 Capitation Payments Actuaries establish the capitation rates using practices established by 42 CFR Part 438 and complying with standards maintained by the Actuarial Standards Board. The following data shall be provided to the actuaries for the purpose of setting and rebasing and/or updating the capitation rates: Utiliza tion and unit cost data derived from fully adjudicated and approved encounters, as well as individual encounter level detail as needed Both unaudited and audited financial statements reported by the Contractors HCBS and Institutional inflation trends Indiana Fee- For-Service (FFS) schedule pricing adjustments (if applicable) Market Basket Inflation Trends 40 Historical and projected enrollment by risk group Programmatic or Medicaid covered service changes that affect reimbursement Additional administrative requirements for the Contractor Other changes to medical practices that affect reimbursement Functional assessment data for NF and HCBS enrollees Supplemental financial reporting requested from the Contractors Rates shall be adjusted to best match payment to risk. This further ensures the actuarial basis for the capitation rates. The following are examples of risk factors that may be included: Reinsurance, Medicare enrollment, Geographic Service Area adjustments, Nursing Facility and HCBS member mix and level of need (based on functional assessments), Chronic conditions and demographics of members enrolled with the Contractor, Member share of cost amounts, Amounts paid by third parties, and Supplemental information requested from Contractors For services or pharmaceuticals, in instances in which Indiana has specialty contracts or legislation/policy limits the allowable reimbursement, the amount to be used in the capitation rate setting process and reconciliations will be the lesser of the contracted/mandated amount or the Contractor paid amount. The above information is reviewed by the actuaries in renewal years to determine if adjustments are necessary. A Contractor may cover services that are not covered under the State Plan section 1915(c), 1915(I), 1915(j), or 1915(k) of the Social Security Act waiver ; however, those services are not included in the data provided to actuaries for setting capitation rates in accordance with 42 CFR 438.6(e). 2.7.7 Medical Loss Ratio On an annual basis, the Contractor shall calculate and submit to FSSA its Medical Loss Ratio (MLR) as described in the MCE Reporting Manual for the [MLTSS Program Name]. The Contractor must attest to the accuracy of the MLR calculation in compliance with 42 CFR 438.8. In addition, the State provides the following clarifications: 1. The MLR calculation shall be performed separately for each MLR reporting year. 41 2. The MLR calculation shall be performed separately for each program. The MLR for the [MLTSS Program Name] program shall be calculated separately from other managed care programs. 3. Expenses shall be appropriately pro- rated among expense types, programs and populations and allocated as required in 42 CFR 438.8(g). The state will provide g uidance on allowable quality expenses, such as care management and service coordination, which the contractor shall follow. 4. For each MLR reporting year, a preliminary calculation will be performed with six months of incurred claims run- out, and a final cal culation will be performed with 18 months of incurred claims run -out. 5. Incurred claims reported in the MLR should relate only to members who were enrolled with the MCE on the date of service, based on data and information available on the reporting date. (Claims for members who were retroactively disenrolled should be recouped from providers and excluded from MLR reporting). 6. Under Sub- Capitated or Sub- Contracted arrangements, the MCE may only include amounts actually paid to providers for covered services and supplies as incurred claims. The non-benefit portion of sub- capitated and sub- contracted payments should be excluded from incurred claims. The MCE should ensure all subcontracts provide for sufficient transparency to allow for this required reporting. The Contractor shall maintain, at a minimum, a MLR of ninety -three percent ( 93%) for its [MLTSS Program N ame] line of business. FSSA considers only the following items as allowable to be considered health quality improvement expenditures under 42 CFR 438.8 and 42 CFR 158.150: Care management, complex care management, and service coordination as defined in Section 4.0 of this contract Contractor assistance with member transitions of care, excluding utilization management such as prior authorization, concurrent review, and retrospective review Quality management, excluding cost of administering member incentives Medical analytics and health information technology, only to the extent that the analytics and technology are used to support care management, risk stratification, or a specific quality initiative Member and provider quality incentives, if they are not already reflected in claims FSSA shall recoup excess capitation paid to the Contractor in the event that the Contractor's MLR is less than ninety -three percent ( 93%) for the [MLTSS Program Name] line of business. Any retroactive changes to capitation rates after the contract year end are required to be incorporated into the MLR calculation. If the retroactive capitation rate adjustment occurs after the MLR report has been submitted, a new report incorporating the c hange will be required to be submitted within thirty ( 30) days of the capitation rate adjustment payment to the Contractor. 42 2.8 Supplemental Payments and Directed Payments 2.8.1 Hospital Assessment Fee Hospital Assessment Fee (HAF) payments will be integrated into capitation rates. Contractors are required to pay HAF hospitals at the enhanced Medicaid rates for HAF eligible services detailed below: 1. HAF eligible hospitals i. Contracted providers: MCEs shall pay one hundred percent (100%) of the enhanced (HAF) rates, which is one hundred percent (100%) of the fee schedule rate multiplied by the HAF factor OR one hundred percent (100%) of the Inpatient APR DRG rate multiplied by the HAF factor. ii. Non- contracted providers: MCEs shall pay ninety -eight percent (98%) of the enhanced (HAF) rates, which is ninety -eight percent (98%) of the fee schedule rate multiplied by the HAF factor OR ninety -eight percent (98%) of the Inpatient APR DRG rate multiplied by the HAF factor. 2. Non- HAF eligible hospitals iii. Contracted providers: MCEs shall pay the amount negotiated with the contracted provider . One hundred percent (100%) of the Medicaid APR DRG rates for Inpatient and one hundred percent (100%) of the Medicaid OP Fee Schedule. iv. Non- contracted providers: MCEs shall pay the following: Ninety -eight percent (98%) of the Medicaid APR DRG rates for Inpatient and ninety -eight percent (98%) of the Medicaid OP Fee Schedule. 2.8.2 Physician Faculty Access to Care (PFAC) Program Enhanced reimbursement is authorized under the Indiana Physician Faculty Access to Care (PFAC) program. Payments for the PFAC program will be integrated into capitation rates. The program provides enhanced reimbursement for physician services rendered to all of the non-dual Medicaid populations, including those served under risk -based managed care programs, by qualified faculty physicians or other eligible practitioners, as defined in the State Plan. Eligible physicians and practitioners must be employed by a hospital system that participates in the PFAC program (currently either Indiana University Health, Inc. (IU Health Physicians) or the Sidney and Lois Eskenazi Hospital (Eskenazi Medical Group), also known as the Health and Hospital Corporation of Marion County. Other hospital systems have expressed interest in the PFAC program and could potentially be added to the program in the future. The physicians must be affiliated with an in- state medical school, licensed by the State of Indiana, and enrolled as an Indiana Medicaid provider. The program also applies to non- physician staff such as nurses, physician assistants, midwifes, social workers, psychologists, and optometrists. Eligible physicians and non -physician staff are eligible for reimbursement at up to the average commercial rate (ACR), with actual enhanced reimbursement subject to annual performance on specified access metrics. Performance payout levels are calculated separately for IU Health Physicians and Eskenazi Medical Group, respectively. The Contractor is responsible for ensuring PFAC payments are delivered to eligible providers whether in or out of network. The PFAC payments are currently made as part of normal claim processing and require the contractor to support a separate fee schedule for use in reimbursing the PFA eligible providers. Options for alternate payment approaches are under consideration by the State. 43 2.8.3 Nursing Facility Supplemental Payments Payments for the Nursing Facility Upper Payment Limit (UPL) supplemental program will not be integrated into the capit ation rates. Payments will be made through either pass -through payments or state- directed payments. The majority of Indiana's nursing facilities participate in the UPL program along with the Non-State Government Owned (NSGO) hospitals that own or operate the nursing facilities. The UPL program is funded at a level that represents the difference between Medicare nursing facility rates and Indiana Medicaid base rates for nursing facility residents covered by Medicaid in a given year. The NSGO or / operator hospitals fund the non- federal portion of the UPL funding through Inter-Governmental Transfers (IGTs) to the State. The State will be responsible for calculating the amount of the quarterly UPL payments due each quarter and for collecting the IGT payments from the NSGOs. There are two sets of payments anticipated for each quarter, one UPL payment to each NSGO and a second quality based UPL payment to each nursing facility. The Contractor is responsible for making quarterly payments to NSGOs and nursing facilities as directed by the State. 2.8.4 LTSS and HCBS Minimum Fee Schedule In and out of network Skilled Nursing Facility, Home Health, Hospice and HCBS providers shall be reimbursed at no less than Fee for Service rates (i.e., a rate established by OMPP) for the first five years of the program. 2.9 Subcontracts The term \"subcontract(s)\" includes contractual agreements between the Contractor and health care providers or other ancillary medical providers. Additionally, the term \"subcontract(s)\" includes contracts between the Contractor and another prepaid health plan, physician- hospital organization, pharmacy benefits manager, dental benefits manager, transportation broker , or any entity that performs delegated activities related to the Contract and any administrative entities not involved in the actual delivery of medical care. FSSA shall approve all subcontractors and any change in subcontractors or material change as outlined in Section 2.9 to subcontracting arrangements. FSSA may waive its right to review subcontracts and material changes to subcontracts. Subcontracts with entities that are located outside of or will perform work outside of the United States and Territories of the United States are prohibited. The State encourages the Contractor to subcontract with entities located in the State of Indiana. According to IC 12- 15-30-5, subcontracts, including provider agreements, cannot extend bey ond the term of the Contract between the Contractor and the State. A reference to this provision and its requirements shall be included in all provider agreements and subcontracts. The Contractor is responsible for monitoring and the performance of any obligations that may result from the Contract. Subcontractor agreements do not terminate the legal responsibility of the Contractor to the State to ensure that all activities under the Contract are carried out. The Contractor shall oversee subcontractor activities and submit an annual report on its subcontractors' compliance, corrective actions , and outcomes of the Contractor's monitoring activities. The Contractor shall be held accountable for any functions and responsibilities that it delegates. The Contractor shall provide that all subcontracts with other prepaid health plans, physician hospital - organizations, pharmacy benefits manager, dental benefits manager, transportation broker or any other 44 entity that performs delegated activities related to the Contract and any administrative entities not involved in the actual delivery of medical care, indemnify and hold harmless the State of Indiana, its officers and employees from all claims and suits, including court costs, attorney's fees and other expenses, brought because of injuries or damage received or sustained by any person, persons or property that is caused by an act or omission of the Contractor and/or the subcontractors. This indemnification requirement does not extend to the contractual obligations and agreements between the Contractor and health care providers or other ancillary medical providers that have contracted with the Contractor. The subcontracts shall further provide that the State shall not provide such indemnification to the subcontractor. Contractors that subcontract with prepaid health plans, physician- hospital organizations , or another entity that accepts financial risk for services the Contractor does not directly provide shall monitor the financial stability of subcontractor(s) whose payments are equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of premium/revenue . The Contractor shall obtain the following information from the subcontractor at least quarterly and use it to monitor the subcontractor's performance: A statement of revenues and expenses A balance sheet Cash flows and changes in equity/fund balance Incurred but not received (IBNR) estimates At least annually, the Contractor must obtain the following additional information from the subcontractor and use this information to monitor the subcontractor's performance: audited financial statements including statement of revenues and expenses, balance sheet, cash flows and changes in equity/fund balance and an actuarial opinion of the IBNR estimates. The Contractor shall make these documents available to FSSA upon request and FSSA reserves the right to review these documents at any time. The Contractor shall comply with 42 CFR 438.230, 42 CFR 434.6 and the following subcontracting requirements: The Contractor shall obtain the explicit approval of FSSA before subcontracting any portion of the program's requirements except for network healthcare providers or ancillary medical providers. Subcontractors may include, but are not limited to a pharmacy benefits manager, dental benefits manager, transportation broker, behavioral health organizations (BHOs) and Physician Hospital Organizations (PHOs). The Contractor may not subcontract medical utilization management activities, but pharmacy utilization management activities may be subcontracted. The Contractor shall give FSSA a written request and submit a draft contract or model provider agreement at least ninety (90) calendar days prior to the use of a subcontractor . The request must include a written plan on continuity of services during any transition of services. If the Contractor makes subsequent changes to the duties included in the subcontractor contract, it shall notify FSSA ninety (90) calendar days prior to the revised contract effective date and submit the amendment for review and approval. FSSA has sixty (60) days to complete a review and provide an approval or denial on the use of the subcontractor to the Contractor. FSSA must approve changes in vendors for any previously approved subcontracts. The Contractor must seek approval from the State for utilizing vendors for member outreach or to provide direct services, medical or behavioral care to members. The Contractor is required to provide a report sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar year listing all such agreements. The report should include method of identifying members for the vendor, services provided, number of members for which each contracted vendor provided services, and standard demographics for the members who received the services. 45 The Contractor may not advertise or announce the new subcontractor relationship prior to FSSA's approval of the subcontract. For subcontractors which result in a material change triggering member or provider notice, the ninety (90) day FSSA review period for the subcontract, thirty (30) day period for document review, and thirty (30) or forty -five (45) day notice requirement may not run concurrently. The Contractor shall evaluate prospective subcontractors' abilities to perform delegated activities prior to contracting with the subcontractor to perform services associated with the [MLTSS Program N ame] program. The Contractor shall have a written agreement in place that specifies the subcontractor's responsibilities and provides an option for revoking delegation or imposing other sanctions if performance is inadequate. The written agreement shall comply with all the State of Indiana statutes and will be subject to the provisions thereof. The subcontract cannot extend beyond the term of the State's Contract with the Contractor. The Contractor shall collect performance and financial data from its subcontractors and monitor delegated performance on an ongoing basis and conduct formal, periodic , and random reviews, as directed by FSSA. The Contractor shall incorporate all subcontractors' data into the Contractor's performance and financial data for a comprehensive evaluation of the Contractor's performance compliance and identify areas for its subcontractors' improvement when appropriate. The Contractor shall take corrective action if deficiencies are identified during the review. All subcontractors shall fulfill all state and federal requirements appropriate to the services or activities delegated under the subcontract. In addition, all subcontractors shall fulfill the requirements of the Contract (and any relevant amendments) that are appropriate to any service or activity delegated under the subcontract. The Contractor shall submit a plan to the State on how the subcontractor will be monitored for debarred employees. The Contractor shall submit a subcontractor oversight and monitoring plan to the State for review and approval during Readiness Review and annually within sixty (60) days . The Contractor shall be responsible for the administration and management of all aspects of this Contract including all subcontracts/subcontractors. The Contractor shall ensure that the subcontractor shall not enter into any subsequent agreements or subcontracts for any of the work contemplated under the subcontractor for purposes of this Contract without prior written approval of the Contractor. No subcontract, provider agreement or other delegation of responsibility terminates or reduces the legal responsibility of the Contractor to the State to ensure that all activities under this Contract are carried out in compliance with the Contract. Should the Contractor have a subcontract arrangement for utilization management activities for pharmacy, the Contractor shall ensure, consistent with 42 CFR 438.210(e) that compensation to individuals or entities that conduct utilization management activities is not structured to provide incentives for the individual or entity to deny, limit, or discontinue medically necessary services to any enrollee, as provided by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the provisions of 42 CFR 438.210(e). If the Contractor subcontracts with an entity specifically to conduct care coordination, care management, or service coordination functions, including comprehensive assessments or reassessments and/or developing or authorizing plans of care, such subcontractor shall not provide any direct long- term services and supports. This does not preclude nursing facilities or hospitals contracted with the Contractor to deliver services from completing and submitting pre-admission evaluations. The care coordinators, care managers, or service coordinators must be in Indiana. FSSA encourages Contractor s who choose to subcontract in this area to consider community -based disability and community -based aging organizations. 46 The Contractor shall provide instruction for all direct service subcontractors and providers regarding the Contractor's written procedure for the provision of language interpretation and translation services for any member who needs such services, including but not limited to, enrollees with Limited English Proficiency. The Contractor shall provide instruction to direct service subcontractors and providers on disability access, person- centered thinking, 42 CFR 441.301(c) settings rule compliance, and ADA compliance. The Contractor and its subcontractors shall comply with obligations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and their accompanying regulations, and as amended. The Contractor shall require all its subcontractors to adhere to HIPAA standard transaction requirements . The Contractor shall comply with all subcontract requirements specified in 42 CFR 438.230, which contains federal subcontracting requirements. All subcontracts, provider contracts, agreements or other arrangements by which the Contractor intends to deliver services required under the Contract, whether or not characterized as a subcontract under the Contract, are subject to review and approval by FSSA and must be sufficient to assure the fulfillment of the requirements of 42 CFR 434.6, which addresses general requirements for all Medicaid contracts and subcontracts. FSSA may waive its right to review subcontracts, provider contracts, agreements or other arrangements. Such waiver shall not constitute a waiver of any subcontract requirement. The Contractor must have policies and procedures addressing auditing and monitoring subcontractors' data, data submissions and performance. The Contractor must integrate subcontractors' financial and performance data (as appropriate) into the Contractor's information system to accurately and completely report Contractor performance and confirm contract compliance. FSSA reserves the right to audit the Contractor's subcontractors' self -reported data and change reporting requirements at any time with reasonable notice. FSSA may require corrective actions and will assess liquidated damages, as specified in Exhibit 2 Contract Compliance and Pay for Outcomes, for non- compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards. The Contractor is prohibited from subcontracting with providers who have been excluded from the federal government or by the Indiana Health Coverage Program (IHCP) for fraud or abuse. The Contractor shall be responsible for checking the lists of providers currently excluded by the state and the federal government every thirty (30) calendar days. The federal list is available at: http://exclusions.oig.hhs.gov . As described in Section 6.0, all network providers must be IHCP enrolled providers. The Contractor shall ensure when the IHCP disenrolls a provider, the Contractor also terminates the provider agreement for the [MLTSS Program N ame] program. If the Contractor uses subcontractors, the subcontractors shall meet the same requirements as the Contractor including requirements related to experience with LTSS and/or experience with older adults where noted. And the Contractor shall demonstrate its oversight and monitoring of the subcontractor's compliance with these requirements. The Contractor shall require subcontractors providing direct services to have quality improvement goals and performance improvement activities specific to the types of services provided by the subcontractors. The Contractor should include in the request for approval of any direct service or care provider a summary of the subcontractor's experience in providing such service and/or care. While the Contractor may choose to subcontract claims processing functions, or portions of those functions, with a state- approved subcontractor, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the use of such subcontractors is invisible to providers, including out -of-network and self -referral providers, and will not result in confusion to the provider community about where to submit claims for payments. For example, the Contractor may elect to establish one post office box address for submission of all out -of-network provider claims. If different subcontracting organizations are responsible for processing those claims, it is 47 the Contractor's responsibility to ensure that the subcontracting organizations forward claims to the appropri ate processing entity. Use of a method such as this will not lengthen the timeliness standards discussed in Section 9.7. In this example, the definition of \"date of receipt\" is the date of the claim's receipt at the post office box. The Contractor and its subcontractors shall maintain all books, documents, papers, accounting records, and other evidence pertaining to all costs incurred under this Contract. As required by 42 CFR 438.3(h), the Contractor shall allow duly authorized agents of the state, CMS, the Office of Inspector General, the Comptroller General and their designees, at any time, to inspect and audit any records or documents of the Contractor or its subcontractors, and may, at any time, inspect premises, physical facilities, and equipment where Medicaid related activities or work is conducted. The right to audit under this section exists for ten ( 10) years from the final date of the contract period or from the date of completion of any audit, whichever is later. Copies shall be furnished at no cost to the State if requested. 2.10 Confidentiality of Member Medical Records and Other Information The Contractor shall ensure that member medical records, as well as any other health and enrollment information that contains individually identifiable health information, are used and disclosed in accordance with the privacy requirements set forth in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule (see 45 CFR parts 160 and 164, subparts A and E, which address security and privacy of individually identifiable health information). The Contractor shall also comply with all other applicable state and federal privacy and confidentiality requirements. 2.11 Internet Quorum (IQ) Inquiries The Contractor shall respond to IQ inquiries within the timeframe set forth by FSSA. When forwarding an IQ inquiry to the Contractor for a response, FSSA shall designate that the inquiry is an IQ inquiry and will identify when the Contractor's response is due. IQ inquiries typically include member, provider and other constituent concerns and require a prompt response. Failure by the Contractor to provide a timely and satisfactory response to IQ inquiries will subject the Contractor to the liquidated damages set forth in Exhibit 2. 2.12 Material Change to Operations A material change to operations is any change in overall business operations, such as policy, process or protocol which affects, or can reasonably be expected to affect the Contractor's membership or provider network. Prior to implementing a material change in operation, the Contractor shall submit a request to FSSA for review and approval at least sixty (6 0) calendar days in advance of the effective date of the change. The request must contain, at minimum, information regarding the nature of the change, the rationale for the change, and the proposed effective date. The contractor may be required, at the direction of FSSA, to communicate material changes to members or providers at least thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of the change. 2.13 Future Program Guidance The State shall make its best efforts to publish a [MLTSS Program N ame] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual on or before the Contract award date and no later than the Contract start date. In addition to complying with the [MLTSS P rogram N ame] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual, the Contractor shall operate in compliance with all future program manuals, guidance and policies and procedures, as well as any amendments thereto. The Contractor shall comply with applicable FSSA bulletins, banners, modules, and guides. Future modifications that have a significant impact on the Contractor's responsibilities, as set forth in this Scope of Work, will be made through the Contract amendment process. 48 2.14 Conflict of Interest The Contractor shall ensure compliance with applicable laws and conflict of interest safeguards in accordance with 42 CFR 438.3(f). When a Contractor refers a member to a provider owned by the Contractor, the Contractor shall notify the member of the conflict of interest. 2.15 Capitation Related to a Vacated Program Should any part of the scope of work under this contract relate to a State program that is no longer authorized by law (e.g., which has been vacated by a court of law, or for which CMS has withdrawn federal authority, or which is the subject of a legislative repeal), the Contractor must not implement that part after the effective date of the loss of program authority.

As such, dental services are a covered benefit under the [MLTSS Program Name] program per Exhibit 3 Program Description and Covered Benefits that the Contractor is responsible for managing and reimbursing. The Contractor will develop a comprehensive oral health strategy, in consultation with dental providers, that ensures appropriate utilization of this benefit by members consistent with dental standards of care. 3.17 Non-Emergency Medical Transportation Services Non- emergency medical transportation (NEMT) services are a covered benefit under the [MLTSS Program Name] program per Exhibit 3 Program Description and Covered Benefits that the Contractor is responsible for managing and reimbursing. NEMT services are intended to assist members in accessing care due to a lack of transportation or insufficient resource to cover travel expenses. NEMT service may be utilized to access any covered non- emergency medical service, as well as support pharmacy and durable medical supply pick -ups and transport related to hospital discharges. The Contractor may provide transport to non- medical services at its o wn discretion and expense as an enhanced benefit, with State approval or through the waiver services. NEMT services must support both on- demand , acute care appointments and subscription medical services trips, including but not limited to dialysis, chemotherapy, radiology, and wound care. NEMT services must be provided to all enrolled members regardless of their residence type, including those members in institutional settings or transient/temporary living centers, such as shelters. In addition, NEMT must provide services to and from all Indiana counties and to all designated locations. NEMT services cover a variety of modality types to ensure access for members regardless of mobility level. This includes ambulatory and bariatric transportation, wheelchair transportation, and stretcher transportation. In addition, the Indiana NEMT system utilizes Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) to provide on demand, backup network support to members who are ambulatory and meet other qualifications. Members must opt into using TNCs before each transport. Under the Indiana Administrative Code 405 IAC 5- 30-1.5, The Contractor must allow for gas and mileage reimbursement when the transportation is provided by a) an able- bodied member, b) a member's family member or c) a member's friend. All Contractors must offer gas/mileage reimbursement and pay a minimum per -mile rate as set annually by the Indiana Department of Administration. The Contractor must have a State-approved process for gas and mileage reimbursement authorization, scheduling and payment. Under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Division CC, Title II, Section 209 the Contractor must provide for a mechanism, which may include attestation, that ensures any provider (including a transportation network company) or individual driver of non- emergency transportation to medically necessary services receiving payments under such plan (but excluding any public transit authority), meets specified minimum requirements. These minimum requirements under the State Plan must include that: i.

In accordance with Indiana Code, all NEMT providers must actively hold Indiana Motor Carrier Certification (unless exempt by law or carrier classification), secure and maintain liability insurance of $1,000,000 plus a $50,000 sexual molestation and abuse rider , and be enrolled as Medicaid provider in the Indiana Health Care Programs (IHCP). The Contractor is responsible for ensuring all initial certification and enrollment are complete prior to contract with a provider, as well as for monitoring the providers, including vehicle compliance inspections and driver education/training. The Contractor is responsible for paying all provider claims, educating providers on claims processing rules and processing encounter data. NEMT expenses must be paid using the MCEs approved capitation payment. The Contractor will also ensure providers are claiming the most appropriate transportation benefit when a member is enrolled in the Contractor's aligned Dually - Eligible Special Needs Plan (D -SNP) and the D -SNP offers non- medical transportation benefits as part of its plan benefit package. The Contractor shall ensure sufficient communication and coordination with the relevant staff at its aligned D -SNP to ensure providers have suff icient awareness about how to access the appropriate member transportation benefit and accurately submit claims to the correct payer source. The Contractor is responsible for establishing and growing an adequate transportation network inclusive of all modality types, including bariatric transports. The Contractor is responsible for provider relations with all transportation providers to ensure providers meet network participation requirements and understand their rights and responsibilities as well as all network participation policies and procedures. Sufficient and safe transportation must be available to members in all Indiana counties as well as out -of-state counties. The Contractor is expected to provide transportation network adequacy G eoAccess maps that detail whether members have access to ambulatory, wheelchair, bariatric wheelchair, stretcher and bariatric stretcher within all ninety -two ( 92) counties. The Contractor must ensure the volume of available transportation providers is commensurate with demand for services, which will be measured at a minimum using data reports and member/provider complaints. The Contractor must ensure that all driver staff receive cultural competency training as part of their onboarding and then annually thereafter. The Contractor must also develop and submit to the state a driver/provider training curriculum to be used in onboarding and as a part of corrective action should issues arise. 3.17.2 NEMT Care Coordination Care plans for members must include transportation needs and how those needs will be met. All [MLTSS Program Name] members shall be provided with a written summary of NEMT services and scheduling process upon enrollment. Transportation must be discussed during the initial care needs assessment and a least quarterly thereafter to ensure the member is not encountering barriers to accessing care. Care Coordinators should work with the member, caregivers and facilities as appropriate to develop the care plan ensuring the member's access to medical care and services. Care Coordinators should be available to troubleshoot issues, make changes to care plans as needed and provide education. The Contractor must have a clear, State-approved process to streamline scheduling standing orders, hospital discharges, and mileage reimbursement requests. The Contractor must also clearly detail how they will coordinate transportation benefits for members enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid (dually -eligible), 85 especially if those members are enrolled in the Contractor's aligned D -SNP and the D -SNP offers non-medical transportation benefits as part of its plan benefit package. The Contractor must allow for an escort to ride with the member if the member may require any of the following: Assistance loading or unloading into the vehicle Non- transportation related assistance during the trip, such as feeding or toileting- support Emotional support during transit or the medical appointment Care and cognitive support to understand diagnosis, ongoing procedures, doct or's instructions and/or other appointment -related information Members shall not be required to provide evidence of their need for an escort. However, they do need to notify the Contractor during scheduling. In addition, the Contractor must ensure call ce nter scheduling staff ask screening questions to determine if the member would be best served by having an escort. The [MLTSS Program Name] members will require considerable transport to and from facilities , including dialysis, nursing facilities, assisted living, HCBS provider locations and member homes. Transportation must be available to members to and from all IHCP service locations and the member's residence, regardless of residence type. The Contractor is required to work with staff at facilities and provider locations to ensure a timely, accurate and safe transport as needed for members. Contractor staff should be available to assist in troubleshooting any issues. 3.17.3 NEMT Communications The Contractor must operate a transportation call center that is available twenty -four (24) hours per day, seven (7) days per week and three hundred and sixty -five (365) days per year. There must be a dedicated facility provider line for scheduling and processing standing orders for transportation. The Contractor must operate a web- based scheduling service so provider facilities, caregivers and members can access assistance online, if they wish. All The Contractor and Transportation Broker materials for providers must b e State-approved. The Contractor is encouraged to develop materials to support facilities staff in securing appropriate transportation for [MLTSS Program Name] members, which also must be State- approved. 3.17.4 NEMT Brokers If the Contractor chooses to utilize a NEMT broker, all requirements set forth by the State of Indiana will be applicable to the Contractor and the broker acting on their behalf. 3.17.5 Community Transportation Community Transportation is a separate service covered for members receiving the HCBS benefit. Details on this service and expectations can be found in the IHCP manual. The Contractor may not utilize a transportation broker for the purposes of scheduling and payment of community transportation. The member's service coordinator shall assist with the scheduling of community transportation. 3.17.6 Attendant Care Aide Transportation Transportation to both community and medical appointments is available for ind ividuals utilizing the attendant care service. Details on the Attendant Care Aide Transportation service can be 86 found in the IHCP manual including requirements specific for medical transportation such as helping the member navigate the appointment itself and providing companionship during the trip. 3.18 Other Covered Benefits and Services The Contractor shall provide diabetes testing supplies coverage for members not eligible for Medicare benefits. The Contractor shall cover diabetes testing supplies in alignment with FSSA's Preferred Diabetes Supply List (PDSL). The Contractor shall configure its claims payment system to approve the diabetes testing supplies of FSSA's contracted preferred vendors to supply blood glucose monitors, including corresponding test strips, and continuous glucose monitors, including corresponding sensors, scanners and reading devices. The Contractor shall require prior authorization for all blood glucose monitors, including corresponding test strips, and continuous glucose monitors, including corresponding sensors, scanners and reading devices, not included on the PDSL. The Contractor shall ensure that NDCs for diabetes testing supplies are included on all claims. 3.19 Service Delivery Innovation The Contractor must promote innovation in the [MLTSS Program Name] service delivery system, through collaborative efforts with FSSA, CMS, the State of Indiana, and local partners as well as innovation pursued on its own initiative . Indiana's focus on continuous system improvement results in the development of initiatives aimed at building a more cohesive and effective health care system in Indiana by reducing fragmentation, structuring provider reimbursements to further quality outcomes, leveraging health information technology, and working with private sector partners to further innovation to the greatest extent. The Contractor shall collaborate and be innovative in the implementation of these targeted initiatives: Person- center ed Service Planning and Delivery , Whole person care, Equity, Care coordination and integration, Housing, Employment , Workforce Innovation , Telehealth services, Public/private partnerships, Electronic Visit Verification (EVV), Emergency Triage, Treat, and Transport (ET3), Payment modernization, Health Information Technology (HIT), Justice System transitions, Transportation, and Trauma informed care 3.20 Carved -out Services Some services are not included in the Contractor's capitation rates for the [MLTSS Program Name] populations and, therefore, are not the responsibility of the Contractor. These services are referred to as \"carved- out\" services. The State fiscal agent pays on a FFS basis for carved- out services rendered to the Contractor's members. However, under some circumstances, assistance related to the carved- out services are the responsibility of the Contractor for reimbursement. Listed below are the carved -out services in the [MLTSS Program Name] program and the conditions under which related services are the Contractor's responsibility. The [MLTSS Program Name] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual describes these carved- out services in greater detail. 87 3.20.1 Medicaid Rehabilitation Option (MRO) Services The Contractor is not responsible for claims reimbursement for such services. However, the Contractor is responsible for ensuring care coordination, as described in Section 3. 6.4, with physical and other behavioral health services for individuals receiving MRO services. See the Provider Reference Module Medicaid Rehabilitation Option Services for specific codes for MRO services. 3.20.2 1915(i) State Plan Home and Community -Based Services The State has three (3) 1915(i) State Plan Home and Community -Based services programs: Behavior al and Primary Healthcare Coordination (BPHC), Adult Mental Health and Habilitation (AMHH) and Children's Mental Health Wraparound (CMHW). These services are carved- out of the Contractor's financial responsibility. The Contractor shall coordinate with 1915(i) services to prevent duplication and fragmentation of services. A listing of carved- out 1915(i) services is provided in the Provider Reference Module Medicaid Rehabilitation Option Services. 3.21 Excluded Services The [MLTSS Program Name] program exclude some benefits from coverage under managed care. These benefits are available under traditional Medicaid or other waiver programs and are therefore excluded from the programs as described below. A member who is, or will be, receiving excluded services must be disenrolled from managed care in order to be eligible for the services. The Contractor is responsible for the member's care until the member is disenrolled from the plan unless stated otherwise. The [MLTSS Program Name] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual describe member disenrollment in greater detail. Listed below are the services excluded from the [MLTSS Program Name] program. 3.21.1 Psychiatric Treatment in a State Hospital [MLTSS Program Name] members receiving psychiatric treatment in a state hospital will be disenrolled from [MLTSS Program Name]. 3.21.2 Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities [MLTSS Program Name] members who are admitted to an Intermediate Care Facility for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF/IID) shall be disenrolled from the Contractor and enrolled in Traditional Medicaid. Before the stay can be reimbursed by the IHCP, the level of care must be approved by the State. The Contractor must coordinate care for its members that are transitioning into an ICF/IID by working with the facility. The Contractor is responsible for payment for up to sixty (60) calendar days for its members placed in an ICF/IID while the level of care determination is pending. 3.21.3 Traumat ic Brain Injury Waiver The Traumatic Brain Injury waiver provides home and community -based services to individuals who, but for the provision of such services, would require institutional care. [MLTSS Program Name] members who become eligible for the Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver will be disenrolled from the Contractor and enrolled Traditional Medicaid. 3.21.4 Community Integration and Habilitation Waiver and Family Supports Waiver The Family Supports Waiver and Community Integration and Habilitation Waivers are the two Medicaid Home and Community Based Services waiver programs for children and adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. [MLTSS Program Name] members who become eligible for either waiver will be disenrolled from [MLTSS Program Name] and enrolled in Traditional Medicaid. 88 3.22 Continuity of Care OMPP is committed to providing continuity of care for members as they transition between various IHCP programs and the Contractor's enrollment. The Contractor shall have mechanisms in place to ensure the continuity of care and coordination of medically necessary health care services for its [MLTSS Program Name] members. The State emphasizes several critically important areas where the Contractor shall address continuity of care. Critical continuity of care areas include, but are not limited to: Transitions for members receiving HIV, Hepatitis C and/or behavioral health services, especially for those members who have received prior authorization from their previous MCE or through fee- for-service; A member's transition into the [MLTSS Program Name] program from no coverage, commercial coverage, traditional fee- for-service, another managed care program; A member's transition between MCEs, particularly during an inpatient stay or skilled nursing facility stay ; A member's transition between IHCP programs ; A member's exiting the [MLTSS Program Name] program to receive excluded services; A member's transition to a new PMP; A member's transition to private insurance or Marketplace coverage; and A member's transition to no coverage. For the first year of the program, the Contractor shall provide continuity of care for the authorization of services as well as choice of providers for one hundred and twenty (120) days. When receiving members from another MCE, fee- for-service, or commercial coverage, the Contractor shall honor the previous care authorizations for one of the following durations, whichever comes first: one hundred and twenty ( 120) calendar days from the member's date of enrollment with the contractor, or the remainder of the prior authorized dates or service, or until the approved units of service are exhausted. The Contractor shall establish policies and procedures for identifying outstanding prior authorization decisions at the time of the member's enrollment in their plan. For a member who meets HCBS Level of Care and has an existing care plan approved by FSSA or another MCE , that care plan will be honored for one hundred and eighty (180) calendar days from the date of enrollment. If the member's current medical or HCBS provider is not a contracted provider the Contractor shall provide for the continuation of care from that provider for at least one hundred and twenty (120) days, as long as the provider is IHCP enrolled. MCEs must have a process to receive and transfer member information and the process must be managed by a transition coordinator. After the first year of the program, the continuity of care period shall be ninety ( 90) days from the date of member enrollment for the authorization of services as well as choice of providers. The Contractor shall honor previous approved FSSA or other Medicaid MCE care plan for one hundred and eighty (180) days after year one (1) of the program. Skilled nursing facilities are an exception to the continuity of care periods above. As skilled nursing facilities serve as the member's residence, forced transitions can cause adverse health outcomes. As such, the Contractor shall provide for continuity of care at the skilled nursing facility for the duration of the program, as long as the member chooses to remain in the facility. This applies only for members who continue to meet skilled nursing facility level of care. 89 The date of member enrollment for purposes of the prior authorization time frames set forth in this section begin on the date the Contractor receives the member's fully eligible file from the State. Additionally, when a member transitions to another source of coverage, the Contractor shall be responsible for efficiently providing the receiving entity with information on any current service authorizations, utilization data and other applicable clinical information such as prevention and wellness programs(s) , case management or care management notes. This process shall be overseen by the transition Coordinator . The Contractor will be responsible for care coordination after the member has disenrolled from the Contractor whenever the member disenrollment occurs during an inpatient s tay. In these cases, the Contractor will remain financially responsible for the hospital DRG payment and any outlier payments (without a capitation payment) until the member is discharged from the hospital or the member's eligibility in Medicaid terminates. The Contractor shall coordinate discharge plans with the member's new MCE. See Section 3. 6.5 for additional requirements regarding continuity of care for behavioral health services. The [MLTSS Program Name] MCE Policies and Procedures Manual describes the Contractor's continuity and coordination of care responsibilities in more detail. 3.23 Out-of-Network Services With the exception of certain self -referral services described in Section 3.2, and the requirements to allow continuity of care as described in Section 3. 22, the Contractor may limit its coverage to services provided by in -network providers once the Contractor has met the network access standards set forth in Section 6. However, in accordance with 42 CFR 438.206(b)(4), which relates to coverage of out -of-network services, the Contractor shall authorize and pay for out -of-network care if the Contractor is unable to provide necessary covered medical services within the required time, distance, and access standards within this contract by the Contractor's provider network. In addition, upon at least thirty (30) calendar days advance notice, the State may also require the Contractor to begin providing out of network care in the event the Contractor is unable to provide necessary covered medical services within the Contractor's provider network within specified timeliness standards defined by the State. The Contractor shall authorize these out -of-network services in the timeframes established and shall adequately cover the services for as long as the Contractor is unable to provide the covered services in-network. The Contractor shall require out -of-network providers to coordinate with the Contractor with respect to payment. Per 42 CFR 438.206(b)(5), the cost to the member for out -of-network services shall be no greater than it would be if the services were furnished in- network. The Contractor may require providers not contracted in the Contractor's network to obtain prior authorization from the Contractor to render any non- self-referral or non- emergent services to Contractor members. If the out -of-network provider has not obtained such prior authorization, the Contractor may deny payment to that out -of-network provider. The Contractor shall cover and reimburse for all authorized, routine care provided to its members by out -of-network providers. Except for situations listed in Section 2.8 the Contractor shall reimburse any out -of-network provider's claim for authorized services at a negotiated rate, or in the absence of a negotiated rate, an amount equal to or higher than ninety -eight percent (98%) of the Medicaid fee- for-service rate. The Contractor may not require an out -of-network provider to acquire a Contractor -assigned provider number for reimbursement. An NPI number shall be sufficient for out -of-network provider reimbursement. 3.24 Enhanced Services The State encourages the Contractor to cover programs that enhance the general health and quality of life of its [MLTSS Program Name] members, including programs that address preventive health, risk 90 factors or quality of life. These enhanced programs and services are above and beyond those covered in the [MLTSS Program Name] program. In addition, all enhanced services shall comply with the member incentives guidelines set forth in Section 7.7 Member Incentive Programs and other relevant state and federal rules regarding inducements. All enhanced services offered by the Contractor must be pre- approved by OMPP prior to initiating such services. Enhanced services may include, but are not limited to, such items as: Enhanced transportation arrangements ( i.e. transportation to obtain pharmacy services, attend member education workshops on nutrition, healthy living, parenting, etc. ); Enhanced tobacco dependence treatment services; Prevention and Wellness Programs or incentives beyond those required by th e State in Section 3.7; Healthy lifestyle incentives ; Group visits with nurse educators Medical equipment or devices not already covered under the [MLTSS Program Name] program to assist in prevention, wellness, or management of chronic conditions; and Cost effective supplemental services which can provide services in a less restrictive setting. While member enhancements and incentives can be powerful tools, these programs need to be thoughtfully designed to ensure there are no unintended consequences, for example increasing disparities or limiting access. To this end, the State has developed guidance to encourage the Contractor to consider the following set of guiding principles in their design and implementation as building blocks of member enhancements and incentives: Culturally sensitive - Ensuring cultural sensitivity is necessary to provide successful outcomes, as cultural norms differ and may need to be incentivized differently; Unbiased - Creating unbiased enhancements and incentives are necessary to comply with federal laws. Incentives must not leave out any groups on the basis of ethnicity, education, race, social class, ability, etc.); Possess equity - Equality is not enough when providing enhanced services and incentives, rather maintaining equity should also be considered (equality would be providing a pair of size 10 shoes to everyone; equity is providing a pair of the correct size shoes to everyone); Communicated appropriately in a timely manner - Incorporate the most appropriate and farthest reaching vehicle to communicate the enhanced benefit and incentive so as not to exclude members (e.g., lack of literacy and technology should be considered). Appropriate messaging should capture high quality outcomes; Be relevant - If barriers exist that prevent members from using the enhanced service and incentive, the incentive will not hold much value (e.g., a member is given a gym membership as an incentive but does not have the transportation to get to the gym). It is important to note the process of designing member enhanced services and incentives is complex and the Contractor will need to consider underlying disparities and SDOH including community needs, and local planning efforts. Member enhanced services and incentives must not reinforce disparities or perpetuate inequality within or between communities, particularly in terms of how disparate subpopulations access wellness services and support. 91 3.25 Residential Substance Use Disorder (SUD) Services Short -term low -intensity and high intensity residential treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) and other substance use disorder (SUD) in settings of all sizes, including facilities that qualify as institutes of mental disease (IMDs) are a covered benefit under the [MLTSS Program Name] program per Exhibit 3 Program Description and Covered Benefits that the Contractor is responsible for managing and reimbursing. Prior authorization (PA) is required for all residential SUD stays. Admission criteria for residential stays for OUD or other SUD treatment is based on the following American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Patient Placement Criteria: 1. ASAM Level 3.1 - Clinically Managed Low -Intensity Residential Services 2. ASAM Level 3.5 - Clinically Managed High- Intensity Residential Services When residential services are determined medically necessary for a member, the Contractor will approve a minimum of fourteen (14) days for residential treatment, unless the facility requests fewer than fourteen (14) days. If a facility determines that a member requires more time than the initial fourteen (14) days, the facility should submit a PA update request showing that the member has made progress but can be expected to show more progress given more treatment time. An additional length of stay can be approved based on documentation of medical necessity. 3.26 Inpatient Hospitalization Notification With appropriate consent, the Contractor shall notify a member's physician when a member is hospitalized or receives Emergency treatment. This notice must be provided within five (5) calendar days of the hospital inpatient admission or Emergency treatment. The Contractor shall maintain strategies to receive hospital notification of inpatient admissions to facilitate meeting this requirement, for example, through the use of incentive programs. 3.27 Medication Therapy Management Services The Contractor shall cover Medication Therapy Management (MTM) services . in accordance with this Section which outlines goals, general requirements, target profile and reporting requirements (hereinafter, \"guidelines\"). 3.27.1 Goals of the MTM Program The goals listed below must remain at the forefront of the program processes implemented by the Contractor on behalf of [MLTSS Program Name] members who are identified as high risk due to a combination of chronic disease state and multiple unique prescribed medications. The MTM program implemented must: Be member focused; Improve medication use; Reduce risk of adverse events; and Improve adherence. 3.27.2 General Requirements The general requirements are based on the CMS Medicare Part D MTM program requirements. While members may refuse to participate in the MTM program, the MTM activities which do not require the member's direct involvement shall continue to be performed by the Contractor. The Contractor shall continue to work with members who do not participate in, or cooperate with, the program. A significant part of MTM involves reviewing members' medication profiles looking for drug- drug interactions, dr ug-disease interactions, adverse reactions, drugs added to counteract side effects of other drugs, or drugs added that have redundant mechanisms of action and 92 thereby increase the risk of toxicity. All of the aforementioned involve interventions with the prescriber and do not necessarily require member interaction. The Contractor is expected to retain metrics for members with whom the Contractor attempts to engage but refuse to participate or cooperate. The Contractor shall continue to attempt to involve those members and shall attempt to engage non- participating members, at minimum, on an annual basis. The MTM program must: Provide interventions (e.g., Comprehensive Medication Review, Targeted Medication Review, review concerns members have about their me dications, make recommendations to providers and members about medications) to be performed by registered pharmacists or other licensed medical professionals such as nurses, nurse practitioners, prescribers and other physicians. During the first four (4) months after Contract initiation, as members transition to [MLTSS Program Name], the Contractor must engage targeted members within one hundred eighty (180) days. Following this four (4) month period, the Contractor must engage new members targeted for MTM within sixty (60) days. Continue working with members who do not participate in, or cooperate with, the program. A significant part of MTM involves reviewing members' medication profiles looking for drug- drug interactions, drug disease interactions, adver se reactions, and drugs added to counteract side effects of other drugs. All of the aforementioned involve interventions with the prescriber and do not necessarily require member interaction. Interact with engaged members, following the initial MTM service, on a frequency as determined by the Contractor, based on member need, but not less than once per year. Include members with the following targeted conditions: Alzheimer's Disease and other Dementias Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) Diabetes Dyslipidemia End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Hypertension Respiratory Disease (i.e. Asthma, COPD, CF, etc.) Bone Disease (i.e. Arthritis, Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis, Rheumatoid Arthritis) Mental Health Disorders (i.e. Depression, Psychosis, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, etc.) Neuromuscular Disorders (i.e. Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease) Viral Disease (i.e. Hepatitis C, HIV, AIDS) In performing MTM functions, the Contractor must demonstrate a thorough understanding of the federal regulations and guidelines which direct the monitoring, oversight, intervention and reporting of psychotropic drug utilization in children and adolescents. Further, in performing MTM functions the Contractor must collaborate and cooperate with the prescriber interventions made as a result of the Indiana Psychotropic Medication Initiative. 3.27.3 Comprehensive Medication Review (CMR) The Contractor must offer a minimum level of CMR services to each member enrolled in the program that includes interventions with members and prescribers. CMR must include: Medication action plan; Personal medication reminders. 3.27.4 Target Mem bers The Contractor's MTM program is expected to target members. Targeted members must meet all of the following criteria: Have three or more (3+) of the targeted conditions in Section 3. 27.2 based on drug claims; and Eight or more (8+) chronic drug claims within the past 12 months. 3.27.5 Reporting Reporting is a critical factor in determining effectiveness of individual MTM programs as well as the MTM program for all Indiana Medicaid members. OMPP retains the authority to request reporting and metrics, as appropriate, to determine effectiveness of individual programs. Minimum requirements for reporting include semi -annual reporting. Reporting requirements include, but are not limited to the following: Number of members enrolled; Average number of disease states; Top 5 (five) disease states engaged; Measure of return on investment (ROI); Change in adherence rate for enrolled members; and Measure of member/provider satisfaction. 4.0 Care Coordination 4.1 Care Coordination Program Overview Prior to Contract start date and on an annual basis, the Contractor shall submit for approval to the State a [MLTSS Program Name] Care Coordination Program Plan. The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan must receive approval before member stratification. The Care Coordination Program Plan shall include, but not be limited to, descriptions of how the Contractor shall comprehensively address the following Care Coordination critical elements and their associated factors: Care Coordination Staff Structure, Comprehensive Health Assessments, Individualized Care Plan (ICP), Interdisciplinary Care Team (ICT), Continuity of Care and Care Transition Protocols. The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan and service delivery must contain evidence of person- centered practices. The State strongly encourages a strengths -based approach in all aspects. A Contractor's Care Coordination Program must include both Care Coordination and Service Coordination and compliment the Contractor's companion D -SNP Model of Care (MOC). The Contractor must offer all members person- centered Care Coordination reflective of their needs to assist them in planning, accessing, and managing their health care and health care- related services. The Contractor shall provide a minimum of two Care Coordination levels of service: Care Management and Complex Case Management. Care Management must be available to all members, while Complex Case Management must be available to high- risk/high- need members who meet State- defined criteria ( Section 4.11.2). All members regardless of their assigned Care Coordination level of service must have an assigned Care Coordinator to facilitate the development of a longitudinal and trusting relationship with each member toward improved quality, continuity and coordination of care. In addition to Care Coordination services, all members who are determined Nursing Facility Level of Care (NFLOC) and receive HCBS or institutional LTSS will be eligible for Service Coordination for their LTSS and related environmental and social services. Service Coordination specifically focuses on supporting members in accessing long -term services and support, medical, social, housing, educational, and other services, regardless of the services' funding sources. All members receiving Service C oordination will have an assigned Service Coordinator who works with the member's Care Coordinator to ensure 94 cohesive, holistic service delivery. At the outset of the [MLTSS Program Name] program, the Contractor shall provide Service Coordination to at least 50% of its enrolled members receiving HCBS waiver services through current Aged & Disabled waiver care management entities. The list of current care management entities will be provided to the Contractor by the State. This requirement shall be in place for the two initial Contract years. Examples of approved waiver care management entities include the Area Agencies on Aging, a network of care management providers, and independent care management providers. To increase the integration of care and the improvement of health outcomes that the alignment of Medicaid and Medicare systems could provide, the Contractor must use the same CMS -approved MOC as the Contractor uses in their exclusively aligned companion D -SNP as the foundation of their [MLTSS Program Name] MOC to provide care management, regardless of the members' Medicare eligibility. In cases where the Contractor's companion D -SNP's CMS -approved MOC does not meet Indiana [MLTSS Program Name] standards as described herein, the Contractor shall modify or adapt its companion D - SNP's CMS -approved MOC approaches to meet the requirements below in Section 4 when delivering Care Coordination services to [MLTSS Program Name] members. In addition, the Care Coordination Program Plan may be modified if the Contractor receives written approval from FSSA. 4.2 Care Coordination Levels of Service and Stratification Based on the results of the Contractor's initial screening (see Section 4.5) as well as mining of historical claims data and clinical data (when available) from health information exchanges, the Contractor shall stratify its membership into various subpopulations to identify member level of service and ensure continuity of care. The outcome of the member assessment set forth in Section 4.6 will dete rmine the member's needs in the stratification process resulting in the member's assignment to one of the levels of care coordination service, which include at a minimum: Care Management and Complex Case Management, as set forth below in this Section. Addi tionally, members may be enrolled in the Right Choices Program (RCP) level of service as described in Section 4.2.4. Prior to the Contract's effective date, the Contractor will propose to FSSA a stratification methodology, which shall include a \"rush\" designation for members with immediate needs. The stratification plan must be approved by FSSA prior to member stratification. In addition, the care coordination classification system may be modified if the Contractor receives written approval from FSSA. In addition to any assigned Care Coordination level of service, members who are determined to be Nursing Facility Level of Care ( NFLOC ) and receiving LTSS in a home, community, or institutional setting are eligible to receive LTSS -specific Service Coordination. The Contractor shall include members who are eligible for Service Coordination when risk stratifying its entire population. The Contractor's stratification methodology shall include a section that describes how the Contractor integrates a Service Coordination- eligible member's information with other Contractor activities, including but not limited to, Utilization Management (UM), and Care Coordination levels of service to assure programs are linked and members receive appropriate and timely c are. As part of the Contractor's Care Coordination Program, the Contractor shall place Service Coordination-eligible members into appropriate Care Coordination programs and/or stratification within a program, not only according to risk level or other clinical or member -provided information but also by the type of setting in which long- term care services are delivered, i.e., nursing facility, community -based residential alternative, or home- based. The targeted interventions for Service Coordination- members should not only be based on risk level but also based on the setting in which the member resides. Under no circumstances shall a member receiving Service Coordination be stratified or assigned to the Contractor's lowest Care Coordination level of service. The Contractor's Service Coordination -eligible member section of their Care Coordination Program Plan must address how the Contractor shall ensure that, upon enrollment into Service Coordination, Service Coordination activities including informal caregiver supports 95 and informal caregiver coaching are integrated with the member's assigned Care Coordination level of service processes and functions and that the member's assigned Service Coordinator has primary responsibility for coordination of the member's LTSS and LTSS -specific person- centered support plan (\"Service Plan\"), which must be integrated into the member's overall Individualized Care Plan (See Section 4.9). A member's Service Coordinator shall be a core participant in the member's Interdisciplina ry Care Team (ICT) and collaborate with the member's Care Coordinator, who has primary responsibility for coordination of the member's physical and behavioral health. Service Coordination staff shall supplement, but not supplant, the role and responsibi lities of the member's Care Coordinator and ICT. The Service Coordinator may use the Contractor's applicable Care Coordination Program's tools and resources, including staff with specialized training, as needed in coordination with the member's Care Coordinator and ICT, to help manage the member's condition(s) in a holistic manner. The Contractor shall develop and operate all Care Coordination levels of service using an \"opt out\" methodology. The Contractor's opt out process shall be submitted to the State as part of the Care Coordination Program Plan for review and approval before implementation. Care Coordination services shall be provided to all eligible members unless they specifically ask to be excluded. The Contractor shall not engage in any activities that encourage members to exclude themselves from Care Coordination or Service Coordination. 4.2.1 Care Management Care Management is the foundational Care Coordination level of service that shall be made available to all [MLTSS Program Name] members and is intended to provide members with assistance with care coordination activities, making preventive care appointments, and/or accessing care for needed health or social services to address the member's chronic health condition(s). Care Management entails a purposeful plan to reach members and impact their health and health care utilization and to coordinate all services provided to members. Care Coordinators shall also assist with fair hearing requests when needed and requested. Through Care Management, the Contractor assists members in improving their health outcomes. The Contractor will provide comprehensive coordination services that are tailored to the individual, rely on sound medical practices, and include Medicaid- covered services. Fo r members who are not determined to meet NFLOC and who have an informal caregiver, the Contractor shall also assist the member's identified, informal caregiver in accessing resources, including training and education, appropriate and applicable to the member and caregiver's needs, in alignment with Section 3.11.1. Care Management services include coordination of care across providers and direct consumer contacts to assist members with scheduling, location of specialists and specialty services, intellectu al and developmental disability services, transportation needs, twenty -four (24) -hour nurse call line use, general preventive (e.g. mammography) and disease specific reminders, pharmacy refill reminders, tobacco cessation and education regarding use of primary care and Emergency services. The Contractor must conduct the minimum member contacts and outreach, as described in Section 4.11.1, for all members assigned to Care Management. At the time of enrollment, members may be receiving case management services through Community Mental Health Centers (CHMCs). The Contractor will educate the member on care coordination delivery options upon and throughout their enrollment and support the member to determine the services the eligible member will receive from the CMHC. The member's preferences shall be documented in the member's care plan. The CMHC and Contractor shall work closely together and engage in regular meetings to discuss issues and progress to ensure the member receives appropriate services that are not duplicated. 96 4.2.2 Complex Case Management Complex Case Management is for members with: three (3) or more disease states which require the ongoing involvement of sub- specialists to manage and deliver disease- appropriate care or two (2) or more \"uncontrolled\" disease states which are defined as disease states requiring immediate attention, for which the member is not currently receiving disease- appropriate screening, follow -up appointments, care, therapy, and/or medication or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) or an active cancer diagnosis or the \"uncontrolled\"/ \"uncompensated\" disease states of heart failure or COPD or diabetes with an A1C of greater than 9.0% or palliative care service needs or serious mental illness or substance use disorder (SUD) or significant cognitive impairment or high dollar claims of over fifty thousand $50,000 dollars (>$50,000) in six (6) months or a NFLOC determination and are receiving LTSS in a home or community -based setting or housing stabilization needs. The Contractor must provide Complex Case Management services for members discharged from an inpatient psychiatric or substance use disorder hospitalization, for no fewer than ninety (90) calendar days following the inpatient hospitalization. The Contractor must also provide Complex Case Management services for any member at risk for inpatient psychiatric, drug overdose, or substance abuse re- hospitalization. Complex Case Management includes all the services and benefits from Care Management. Complex Case Management involves the active coordination of care and services with the member and between providers while navigating the extensive systems and resources required for the member. It includes the Comprehensive Health Assessment, determination of availabl e benefits, development and implementation of an ICP, which includes specific objectives, goals and action protocols to meet the member's identified needs, as established through a person-centered planning process and ICT collaboration. For members who are assigned to Complex Case Management level of service but are not determined NFLOC, the member's Care Coordinator shall be responsible for the coordination of all the member's needed medical and non- medical services, including functional, social, and environmental services. The Contractor must conduct the minimum member contacts and outreach, as required in Section 4.11.2 of this Contract, for all members assigned to Complex Case Management. Avoidance of unnecessary Emergency department and inpatient hospitalizations and increased use of preventive health care are goals for Complex Case Management. 97 4.2.3 Complex Case Management and Service Coordination In addition to Complex Case Management, members who are determined NFLOC and receive LTSS shall receive LTSS -specific Service Coordination. Service Coordination is a process of assessment, discovery, planning, facilitation, advocacy, collaboration, and monitoring of the holistic LTSS and related environmental and social needs of each individual. The Service Coordinator is responsible for the development and implementation of the LTSS -specific person- centered support plan (\"Service Plan\") and for assisting members in gaining access to long term services and supports, as well as medical, social, housing, educational, and other services, regardless of the funding source for the services, to ensure the member's health, safety and welfare, and as applicable, to delay or prevent the need for institutional placement. The Service Coordinator shall collaborate with the member's Care Coordinator and provide for the regular review and modification of the member's LTSS -specific Service Plan with the member, their caregivers with the consent of the member, and the member's ICT. 4.2.4 Right Choices Program The Right Choices Program (RCP) is Indiana's restricted card program. The purpose of the RCP is to identify members who use covered services more extensively than their peers and/or exhibit drug- seeking behaviors. The program, set forth in 405 IAC 1-1- 2(c) and 405 IAC 5 -6, is designed to monitor member utilization, and when appropriate, implement restrictions for those members who would benefit from increased care coordination. The RCP follows the CMS design of a Patient Review and Restrict (PRR) program that is focused on behaviors of Doctor Shopping and excessive utilization of Controlled Substances, especially Opioids. The Contractor will provide appropriate prevention and wellness programs(s), care management, or complex case management services to the RCP members. Program policies, set forth by the FSSA for the RCP, are delineated in the Right Choices Program Policy Manual. The Contractor shall comply with the program policies set forth in the Right Choices Program Policy Manual, which is provided in the Bidders' Library. The Contractor shall be responsible for RCP duties for their members, as outlined in the Right Choices Program Policy Manual, including, but not limited to, the following: Evaluate claims, medical information, referrals, and data to identify members to be enrolled in the RCP. Before enrolling a member in the RCP, the Contractor must ensure a physician, pharmacist, or nurse confirms the appropriateness of the enrollment; Enroll members in the RCP; Provide written notification of RCP status to such members and their assigned primary physicians and pharmacies; Intervene in the care provided to RCP members by providing, at minimum, enhanced education, case management, and care coordination with the goal of modifying member behavior; Provide appropriate customer service to providers and members; Evaluate and monitor the member's compliance with their treatment plan to determine if the RCP restrictions should terminate or continue; Notify FSSA of members that are being reported to the FSSA Bureau of Investigation for suspected or alleged fraudulent activities; Provide ad- hoc reports about RCP to FSSA upon request; 98 Cooperate with FSSA in evaluation activities of the program by providing data and/or feedback when requested by FSSA; Meet with FSSA about RCP program implementation as requested by FSSA; and Develop, for FSSA approval, and implement internal policies and procedures regarding the Contractor's RCP program administration. 4.3 MLTSS and Medicare Care Coordination Alignment The [ MLTSS Program Name] population will include members in the following three categories based on Medicaid and Medicare eligibility and enrollment alignment: \"Medicaid Only,\" which includes members who are solely Medicaid eligible and enrolled in only [MLTSS Program Name] \"Dual Eligible - Aligned,\" which includes dually eligible members who are enrolled in both the Contractor's [MLTSS Program Name] program and the Contractor's exclusively aligned -SNP \"Dual Eligible - Unaligned,\" which incl udes dually eligible who are enrolled in the Contractor's [MLTSS Program Name] program and any unaligned Medicare service delivery system. This would include enrollment in traditional Medicare, any non- SNP Medicare Advantage Plan, Chronic Condition Special Needs Plans (C -SNPs), and Institutional Special Needs Plans (I - SNPs). Members may change between the above three categories frequently and unpredictably. As such, the Contractor must maintain staff capability and systems capacity to identify, reassess, and recategorize members swiftly and according to their changing Medicaid and Medicare eligibility and enrollment status. The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan shall describe how the Contractor plans to deliver Care Coordination and Service Coordination services to members in each of the three categories, \"Medicaid Only,\" \"Dual Eligible - Aligned\" and \"Dual Eligible - Unaligned.\" At a minimum, the Contractor must ensure the member's Care Coordinator coordinates with all Medicare payers, Medicare Advantage plans, and Medicare providers as appropriate to coordinate the care and benefits of members who are also eligible for Medicare. For dually eligible members, the Contractor must describe how it intends to maximize the integration of Medi care and Medicaid services and promote the seamless coordination of their care. For members in the \"Dual Eligible - Aligned\" category, this may include but is not limited to an integrated assessment and care coordination process that spans all MA and Medicare services, including behavioral health services. The \"Dual Eligible - Aligned\" member's Care Coordinator and the companion D -SNP's staff shall be responsible for coordinating the full range of Medicaid, including LTSS, and Medicare benefits, have access to all of the information needed to do so, and the Contractor's systems and business process shall support an integrated approach to care coordination and service delivery. Administrative integration is expected to evolve over the life of the MLTSS program. The Contractor will cooperate fully with the State and CMS in their ongoing efforts to streamline administration of the two programs, which may include, but is not limited to, coordinated readiness reviews, monitoring, enrollment, member materials and appeals processes. The Contractor shall respond to requests from the State for its companion D -SNP's operational, benefit, network, financial and oversight information that directly impacts the continued integration of Medicare and Medicaid benefits in order to maintain a seamless service delivery of Medicare and Medicaid benefits to members. The Contractor shall identify and include all necessary parties from both the [MLTSS Program Name] and its aligned D -SNP in requests and responses to avoid administrat ive duplication. The Contractor shall coordinate all Medicare and Medicaid services for its full -benefit dually eligible members. Please see Section 2.21 for additional requirements, regarding the Contractor's responsibilities 99 for the heightened integr ation of Medicare and Medicaid services and administrative alignment across the two programs. The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring seamless coordination of discharge planning on behalf of members enrolled in its companion D -SNP (Dual Eligible - Aligned) and for coordinating with other Medicare payors and plans, including traditional Medicare, unaligned Medicare Advantage plans, Chronic Conditions Special Needs Plans (C -SNPs), and Institutional Special Needs Plans (I -SNPs) for members who are \"Dual Eligible - Unaligned\". This shall include, but not be limited to the appropriate triage of inpatient admission notifications and coordination in discharge planning when Medicaid LTSS or other Medicaid services are needed upon discharge in order to ensure that care is provided in the most appropriate, cost effective, and integrated setting. The Contractor is responsible for providing medically necessary covered services to members who are also eligible for Medicare if the service is not covered by Medicare. For members in \"Dual Eligible - Unaligned\" category, the Contractor shall request, when appropriate and available, the member's Medicare payor or plan's participation in needs assessments and/or the development of an integrated person- centered plan of care for the Contractor's [MLTSS P rogram N ame] member, encompassing Medicare benefits provided by the payor or plan as well as Medicaid benefits provided by the Contractor. To the extent possible, the Contractor shall establish protocols and systems to share necessary data across payors, plans, and programs to facilitate an effective care coordination process for \"Dual Eligible \u2014Unaligned\" members. 4.4 Subpopulations at Greater Risk for Negative Health Outcomes The Contractor is expected to develop and deliver tailored services for member subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes. The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan must describe the member subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes within the [MLTSS Program Name] population (i.e., what sets them apart from the overall [MLTSS Program Name] population), the methodology used to identify them (e.g., data collected on multiple hospital admissions within a specified time frame; high pharmacy utilization; high risk and resultant costs; specific diagnoses and subsequent treatment; medical, psychosocial, cognitive or functional challenges) and the specially tailored services for which these members are eligible. The Contractor must provide information about its local target population in the service areas covered under the Contract; information about national population statistics will be considered insufficient for this purpose. The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan's definition of its subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes members must describe the demographic characteristics of this population (i.e., average age, gender, ethnicity, language barriers, deficits in health literacy, poor socioeconomic status and other factors such as trauma) and specify how these characteristics combine to adversely affect health status and outcomes and affect the need for unique clinical interventions. The definition must include a description of special services and resources the Contractor anticipates for provision of care to these member subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes . The Contractor's Care Coordination Program Plan must describe the Contractor's process for partnering with providers within the community to deliver needed services to its subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes , including the type of specialized resources and services provided, and how the Contractor works with its partners to facilitate member or caregiver access and maintain continuity of services. As part of the annual Care Coordination Program review process, the State may identify new or changing groups or subpopulations of members at greater risk for negative health outcomes, which the Contractor must incorporate into its definition for subpopulations of members at greater risk for negative health outcomes and address through specially tailored services. 100 4.4.1 State- identified Members at Greater Risk for Negative Health Outcomes As part of its annual Care Coordination Program Plan, the Contractor must propose evidence- based practices and specific approaches for coordinating the care of members who have or meet the following State- identified statuses, conditions, and/or needs: Alzheimer's disease and related dementias of care, hospice and end- of-life care Informal caregiver stress or loss High-risk of social isolation/loneliness especially if a member does not have informal caregiver support and lives alone Housing insecure or homeless Polypharmacy in need of medication management Enteral and parenteral nutrition Previously incarcerated Adult protective services Inpatient Psychiatric Care Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Severe Mental Illness (SMI) Substance Use Disorder (SUD) High dental needs Ventilator -dependent The Contractor must describe how it will identify members or use data sent by the State to identify members with the above statuses, conditions, or needs for inclusion in a specific Care Coordination program or stratification within a program; identify and address condition or need- specific goals/objectives; and ensure each goal/objective is integrated into or otherwise reflected in the member's care assessment(s), Interdisciplinary Care Team (ICT) resources, Individualized Care Plan, Service Plan (if applicable), and service delivery. The State reserves the right to require the Contractor to address new or revised State- identified statuses, conditions, and/or needs to reflect new or changing subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes . Over the life of the Contract, the State reserves the right to mandate that the Contractor adopt State -identified best practices in the identification, treatment, and/or coordination of care of specific groups and members at greater risk for negative health outcomes . 4.5 Initial Screening The Contractor shall conduct an initial screening of each member within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of enrollment to identify the member's immediate physical and/or behavioral healthcare needs and facilitate the member's assignment to the appropriate Care Coordination level of service as detailed in Section 4.2. The Contractor must make at least three subsequent attempts on different days to conduct an initial screening of each member's needs if the initial attempt to contact the member is unsuccessful. The Contractor shall make attempts to find a member's current contact information if it is not included in the enrollment file. The Contractor shall use the FSSA Health Needs Screening tool. 101 In addition to the completion of the FSSA Health Needs Screening tool, initial screening and stratification activities include a review of the member's claims history (when available), identification of access or accommodation needs, language barriers, or other factors that might indicate the member's communication preferences. The initial screening shall also identify members who have complex or serious medical conditions that require an expedited appointment with an appropriate provider. The initial screening will ensure that members who are in ongoing treatment receive assistance in accessing appropriate care in order to avoid disruptions in services. The initial screening must include a review of important relevant, available clinical information such as the provider's assessment of conditions and the severity of illness, treatment history and outcomes, other diseases, illnesses, and health conditions as well as the member's immediate psychosocial, support, behavioral health and treatment needs. Through data analysis and predictive modeling, the Contractor will identify members who are at the highest risk for hospitalization or relapse, or high cost and/or high utilization in the future. At a minimum, the initial screening shall: Utilize the FSSA Health Needs Screening tool Utilize claims data, health information exchange data, information gathered in the screening, medical records and other sources, as available; Identify gaps in member's care and facilitate communication to relevant providers, including the member's PMP, if applicable; Identify any immediate physical and/or behavioral health needs; Determine need for Care Coordination levels of service and LTSS -specific Service Coordination; Determine need for a referral of the member for a NFLOC assessment and determination; Conduct review of clinical history; Gather information regarding level and type of existing care management; and Provide an option for members to decline Care Coordination and/or Service Coordination with information on how members can opt back in at any time. 4.6 Comprehensive Health Assessment The Contractor shall conduct a Comprehensive Health Assessment using a State- developed Comprehensive Health Assessment Tool (CHAT) of all members following the initial screening in order to further identi fy the appropriate services, programs, and Care Coordination level of service for the member. The Comprehensive Health Assessment will be all -inclusive and identify the clinical, psychosocial, functional and financial needs of the member to ensure appropriate referrals to MCE programs and community -based organizations. The CHAT shall be completed according to the timeframes below and will be used to develop and implement an ICP to meet the member's needs. a. For members who are receiving LTSS in a nursing facility at the time of enrollment, the Contractor shall conduct the Comprehensive Health Assessment or State- approved nursing facility assessment(s) ( Section 4.8.1) onsite within thirty (30) calendar days of the MCE effective date. b. For members who meet NFLOC and are either receiving HCBS, waiting to receive, or opt to receive HCBS at the time of enrollment, the Contractor shall conduct the Comprehensive Health Assessment onsite within thirty (30) calendar days of the MCE effective date. c. For enrollees who do not meet NFLOC and are not receiving LTSS in an institutional, home, or community -based setting at the time of enrollment, the Contractor shall conduct a Comprehensive Health Assessment onsite or by phone within ninety (90) calendar days of the MCE effective date. 102 An on -site visit shall be conducted to develop the member's ICP at the member's place of residence (or another location of the member's preference) for members who are enrolled while receiving or waiting to receive HCBS or at an institutional setting for members who are enrolled during a hospital stay or while residing in a facility. Confirmation of the scheduled on -site visit is recommended prior to the meeting. The member shall be present for, and be included in, the on- site vis it. The member is always central to the assessment process, and all aspects of the care planning and assessment processes involving the participation of the member must be timely and occur at times and locations consistent with the requirements herein. The Contractor shall inform members that they may request the Comprehensive Health Assessment be conducted in alternative modes, such as by phone or virtual visit, or settings, besides at the member's place of residence or service location. Upon request and to the extent possible, the Contractor shall coordinate with the member and/or the member's family member, informal caregiver, Supported Decision Maker(s), legal guardian, and/or Designated Representative to conduct the Comprehensive Health Assessment in a mode or setting convenient to the member and member's circle of support and reflective of the member's expressed preferences. The Contractor may outreach to members to inquire if the alternative Comprehensive Health Assessment arrangements are the desired mode/setting for follow -up assessments and reassessments. The member's family member, legal guardian, informal caregiver, Supported Decision Maker(s), and/or Authorized Representative (as applicable and/or determined by the member) shall be contacted for the Comprehensive Health Assessment and care planning meeting, including establishing service needs and setting goals, if the member is unable to participate. For members in need of services provided by the LTC Ombudsman, the Contractor shall, as appropriate, invite an LTC Ombudsman staff person to participate in the member's assessment and reassessment process for both the CHAT and any LTSS - specific assessments for those members who qualify for Service Coordination in accordance with Section 5.13. The State -developed CHAT shall include a functional assessment based on the interRAI and a social determinants of health (SD OH) questionnaire based on the Accountable Health Communities (AHC) Model. The CHAT shall also include an assessment of vulnerability and risk factors for abuse and neglect in the member's personal life or finances including an assessment of the member's potential vulnerability/high risk per Section 5.13. Completion of this component of the CHAT shall be documented in the member record. The CHAT may be augmented with condition specific and/or Contractor specific elements upon review and approval by FSSA. The Comprehensive Health Assessment shall include the same components as the State- determined Level of Care (LOC) assessment, and the Contractor shall be responsible for sending applicable CHAT results to a state- designated enrollment partner for members in need of a NFLOC determination. Additionally, should a member receive the LOC assessment prior to receiving the Comprehensive Health Assessment from the Contractor, the Contractor must be able to electronically receive and act upon the resulting NFLOC determination and incorporate any LOC assessment results provided by any state- designated enrollment partners (e.g., hospital, AAA, vendor, etc.) into the CHAT on behalf of the member, in lieu of readministering the corresponding components of the CHAT to the member during the Comprehensive Health Assessment process. The Contractor must collaborate where possible with other contractors and Medicare plans (see Section 4.3) to receive, process, and incorporate the results of assessments equivalent to individual CHAT components to reduce member burden by preventing the need for duplicative assessments. As part of the Comprehensive Health Assessment process, the Contractor shall work with the member and collect and review medical and educational information, as well as family and caregiver input, as appropriate, to identify the member's care strengths, health needs and available resources. The Comprehensive Health Assessment may include, but is not limited to, a review of the member's claims history and contact with the member and/or member's family, their informal caregiver, PMP (if applicable), or other significant providers with the consent of the member. A clinician on the Contractor's Care Coordination team will review the findings of the CHAT and provide the findings to the member's ICT and primary providers, including the member's PMP and/or behavioral health care providers, as applicable. 103 The results of the Comprehensive Health Assessment shall be incorporated into the member's record and be made available to the member's ICT for Care Coordination and Service Coordination activities, as applicabl e. For members who receive Service Coordination in addition to Care Coordination, the Contractor shall ensure that the member's Service Coordinator and ICT are provided with all CHAT and Care Coordination assessment results applicable to LTSS -specific Service Coordination to inform Service Planning and prevent the need for the administration of duplicative assessments. The Contractor must maintain methods to maximize contacts with members in order to complete the Comprehensive Health Assessment required in this Section 4.6. As part of the Contractor's annual Care Coordination Program plan and State review process, as described in Section 4.1, the Contractor must describe how the CHAT is used to develop and update, in a timely manner, the ICP for each member and how the CHAT information is disseminated to and used by the ICT. The Contractor must also describe its process for attempting to contact members and have them complete the CHAT, including provisions for members that cannot or do not want to be contacted or complete the CHAT. The Contractor must describe its plan and explain its rationale for reviewing, analyzing, and stratifying CHAT results to assign members to State- defined Care Coordination levels of service and identify members as part of subpopulations at greater risk for negative health outcomes that would benefit from the Contractor's targeted interventions and subpopulation- specific approaches described in Section 4.4.1. The Contractor must describe the mechanisms for communicating information to the ICT, provider network, members and/or their caregivers , and other Contractor personnel who may be involved with overseeing a member's plan of care, including mechanisms for requesting the member's consent when needed. The Contractor must explain how the Contractor uses CHAT results to improve the care coordination process. The Contractor must describe how it will coordinate with providers and other parties, including the Contractor's companion D -SNP and other Medicare Advantage plans in order to reduce the assessments/assessment components identified as duplicative, administratively onerous, and/or overly burdensome to members and providers. At a minimum, the Contractor must describe how it will incorporate LOC assessment results from the State's designated enrollment partner who performs NFLOC determinations into the CHAT. The Contractor's annual Care Coordination Plan must describe how results from the CHAT for \"Dual Eligible - Aligned\" members will be incorporated to the greatest extent possible with that member's aligned D -SNP Health Risk Assessment Tool (HRAT) to limit duplication in assessments and to eliminate unnecessary administrative processes. The Contractor must maintain sufficient system and staff capacity to seamlessly link assessment information from both the CHAT and the D -SNP HRAT into a holistic composite of the care needs for members identified as \"Dual Eligible - Aligned.\" The Contractor shall have detailed writing protocols in place for how to operationalize the care decisions that flow from both the CHAT and HRAT with the appropriate Contractor and aligned D -SNP staff to support the work of the ICT. The Contractor shall also ensure that there is sufficient staff capacity to understand and fluently communicate how the assessment linkage will better support both members and providers. 4.7 Reassessments The Contractor will develop a process for reviewing and updating Individualized Care Plans with members, and with their consent, their family members and informal caregivers, on an as -needed basis, but no less often than annually. For members who qualify for Service Coordination and receive LTSS in the home or community, the member's Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator shall jointly conduct the CHAT reassessment onsite and send the applicable CHAT results to the entity or entities designated by the State for an updated NFLOC determination. For members residing in nursing facilities, the entity(ies) 104 designated by the State shall conduct the annual LOC reassessment every 365 days and submit the results to the Contractor for incorporation into the member's record, after which the member's Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator shall meet jointly with the member to review and update the member's ICP and complete any other assessment components based on the member's needs. The ICT staff conducting reassessments shall ensure that the other ICT participants are updated and involved as necessary on reassessments. In addition, members may move between stratified Care Coordination level of service groups over time as their needs change, therefore, the Contractor shall develop a protocol for re- evaluating members periodically to determine if their present care levels are adequate. The Contractor must at minimum re- screen and conduct a Comprehensive Health Assessment within one year of the initial assessment and within one year thereafter. Additionally, any member or provider can request that a member's Care Coordination level of service be reassessed for redetermination at any time. In the Contractor's annual Care Coordination Program Plan, the Contractor shall establish a process for identifying and addressing the State- defined trigger events listed below. If a trigger event occurs, the Contractor must at a minimum reassess the member as expeditiously as possible in accordance with the circumstances and as clinically indicated by the member's health status and needs, but in no case more than five (5) business days after the occurrence of the following State- defined trigger events: A significant healthcare event to include but not be limited to a hospital admission, a transition between healthcare settings, or a hospital disc harge. A change or loss of informal caregiver. A decline in social status (e.g. increased isolation/loneliness). A change in the home setting or environment if the change impacts one or more areas of health or functional status. A change in diagnosis that is not temporary or episodic and that impacts one or more area of health status or functioning As requested by the member or member's designee, caregiver, provider, the member's ICT, or the State. When a complex medication regimen or behavior modifying medication or both are prescribed for a member, the ICT staff nurse or other appropriately licensed medical professional shall ensure the member is assessed and reassessed, as needed, but at least every six months for the desired responses and possible side effects of the medication, and understands the potential benefits and side effects of the medication and that all assessments results and follow -up have been completed and documented in the member record. If a complex medication regimen or be havior -modifying medication or both are prescribed, the ICT staff nurse or other appropriately licensed medical professional shall ensure that the Comprehensive Health Assessment includes the rationale for use and a detailed description of the behaviors which indicate the need for administration of the complex medication regime or behavior - modifying medication. The Contractor shall also identify any triggers which would immediately move the member to a more intensive level of Care Coordination. 4.8 LTSS -specific Assessments For members who qualify for Service Coordination, the Service Coordinator shall use the results of the member's CHAT and/or LOC assessment as the foundation of the strengths -based, LTSS -specific service planning process. Based on the member's choice and/or preferences, needs and risk factors, the Service Coordinator may conduct additional LTSS -specific assessments and reassessments. The member's Service Coordinator will appropriately facilitate this LTSS -specific assessment process through the application of person- centered discovery tools and practice to engage the member and the member's 105 circle of support including their family members and informal caregiver, or another identified representative. At a minimum, the Service Coordinator shall conduct the following assessments as part of the LTSS - specific assessment process: Monthly loneliness assessment, per the UCLA Three- Item Loneliness Scale, unless the member opts for less frequent check -ins according to Section 4.11 Quarterly needs assessment, per a 90- day review tool developed or approved by the State Annual LOC reassessment, per the CHAT and conducted jointly with the member's Care Coordinator, for members receiving HCBS Annual informal caregiver assessment, as described in Se ction 4.8.2 Assessments can be conducted more often depending on the member's changing needs. Based on the outcomes of the assessments, a person- centered support plan (\"Service Plan\") is developed to address the member's LTSS needs and goals. The Service Plan must be integrated into the member's record and overall ICP. The Contractor shall inform members that they may request the LTSS -specific assessments be conducted in alternative modes, such as by phone or virtual visit, or settings, besides at the member's place of residence or service location.

Communication documentation must include the complete date and signature. Communication documentation must be stored electronically and be made available to the State upon request. 4.12 Transitions Older adults or adults with disabilities moving between different health care settings are particularly vulnerable to receiving fragmented and unsafe care when transitions are poorly coordinated; thus, the Contractor must work actively to coordinate transitions, in accordance with the requirements herein. A \"transition\" is the movement of a member from one care setting to another as the member's health status changes. A \"care setting\" is the provider from whom or setting where a member receives health 119 care and health- related services. In any setting, a designated practitioner has ongoing responsibility for a member's medical care. Settings include, but are not limited to, home, home health care, acute care, skilled nursing facility, custodial nursing facility, rehabilitation facility and outpatient/ ambulatory care/surgery centers. The Contractor shall be responsible for coordinating a member's care throughout the transition process, which encompasses the period from identification of a member who is at risk for a care transition through the completion of a transition. This process includes planning and preparation for transitions and the follow -up care after transitions are completed. The Contractor shall facilitate the transition process even when a member is transitioning to a facility or service for which the Contractor is not the primary payor. Care Coordinators must conduct an on- site visit within ten (10) days of a member's change of care setting. For members who are transitioning, as defined in this Section, from the home or community into a nursing facility, the member's Care Coordinator shal l conduct an on- site visit within ten (10) days of transition to review and update the member's plan of care and to establish a schedule for ongoing Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator contact with the member. For members who are specifically transitioning, from an inpatient hospital stay (see Section 4.12.3) or institutional setting (see Section 4.12.2) back to the home or community, the member's Care Coordinator must make an on- site visit to the member's home or planned residence within three (3) days of transition. Section 4.12.2 covers additional nursing facility -to-community transition contact requirements. 4.12.1 Relocation Targeted Case Management The Contractor must provide Relocation Targeted Case Management services in alignment with the process described in Section 4 .12.2 for any Nursing Facility resident who is planning to return to the community and who requires support services to do so. This can be a part of Service Coordination services provided by the member's Service Coordinator. The Contractor's annual Care Coordination Program Plan must identify and describe the different personnel on the member's Transition Team responsible for coordinating the care transition process and for ensuring that f ollow -up services and appointments are scheduled and performed. At a minimum, the member's Service Coordinator and Care Coordinator must participate in the member's Transition Team. The Contractor shall have a process in place to notify members and/or their informal caregivers of the Transition Team personnel responsible for supporting them through transitions between any two care settings. 4.12.2 Nursing Facility- to-Community Transitions The Contractor shall develop and implement methods for identifying members who may have the ability and/or desire to transition from a nursing facility to the community. Such methods shall include, at a minimum: a. Referrals, including but not limited to, treating physician, nursing facility, other providers, community -based organizations, family, and self -referrals; b. Identification through the Care Coordination or Service Coordination process, including but not limited to: assessments, information gathered from nursing facility staff or review and assessment of members whose nursing facility level of care is ending and who appear to meet the at -risk level of care for HCBS. c. Review and analysis of members identified by the State based on Minimum Data Set (MDS) data from nursing facilities. Notwithstanding the nur sing facility -to-community transition requirements set forth in this Section, the Contractor shall be responsible for monitoring all NF resident members' level of care eligibility and for completing the process to refer a member to a State- designated entity for nursing facility 120 level of care assessment and determination or to transition a member to receive services in the home or community as appropriate, prior to the expiration of nursing facility level of care. For transition referrals by or on behalf of a nursing facility resident, regardless of referral source, the Contractor shall ensure that within fourteen (14) days of the referral a Service Coordinator conducts an in- facility visit with the member to determine the member's interest in and potential ability to transition to the community and provide orientation and information to the member regarding transition activities. The results of a Service Coordinator's in- facility visit must be conveyed to the member's Care Coordinator, and any resulting tra nsition must be jointly coordinated by the member's Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator, with support provided as needed by other Transition Team participants. If the Contractor becomes aware by means other than direct referral or the Care Coordination or Service Coordination process of a member who may have the ability and/or desire to transition from a nursing facility to the community, the Contractor shall ensure that within thirty (30) days of such identification a Service Coordinator conducts an in- facility visit with the member to determine whether or not the member is interested in and the member's potential ability to pursue transition to the community. For trend monitoring and in accordance with FSSA's program goals of person- centeredness, the Service Coordinator shall notify the LTC Ombudsman of individuals who have expressed interest in transitioning back to the home or community and who have not been supported in doing so within ninety (90) days. The member's Service Coordinator/Care Coordination team shall document in the member's case file that transition was discussed with the member and indicate the member's wishes as well as the member's potential for transition. The Contractor shall not require a member to transi tion when the member expresses a desire to continue receiving nursing facility services.

This assessment shall include the identification of any barriers to a safe transition. Any nursing facility to community transition shall be based on the individualized needs and preferences of the member. The Contractor shall not establish a minimum number of members on any Care Coordinator or Service Coordinator's caseload or a minimum number of residents of any facility that must be transitioned to the community. The Contractor shall ensure that Care Coordinators and Service Coordinators are screening members' potential for and interest in transition and when applicable, facilitating transition activities in a timely manner, but shall not require any Care Coordinator or Service Coordinator as a condition of employment to identify a minimum number of nursing facility residents for transition to the community. Nor shall the Contractor pay any Care Coordinator or Service Coordinator an incentive or bonus based on the number of persons transitioned from a nursing facility to the community, to ensure that transitions are appropriate and consistent with the needs and preferences of residents. The Contractor must employ a sufficient number of dedicated staff members without caseloads, who specialize in supporting nursing facility -to-community transitions and who also meet the qualifications of a Service Coordinator specified in Section 4.14 to serve as Transition- dedicated Service Coordinators and support Transition Teams as needed across the State.

The Contractor shall update the member's Service Plan, including any identified risks and corresponding mitigati on strategies for HCBS members, as deemed necessary based on the member's needs and circumstances. The Service Coordinator must fully inform the member and member's family and/or informal caregiver, as applicable and with the consent of the member, of any identified risks to transition and engage the member in determining appropriate mitigation strategies in alignment with the member's expressed preferences and goals. The Service Plan shall include the frequency and type of Care Coordination and Service Coordinator contacts that exceed the minimum contacts required, to mitigate any additional risks associated with transition and shall address any special circumstances due to transition. For those members whose transition assessment indicates that they are candidates for transition to the community, the Service Coordinator shall facilitate in coordination with the member's Care Coordinator the development of and complete a transition plan within fourteen (14) days of the member's transition assessment. The Service Coordinator shall include other individuals such as the member's family and/or informal caregiver in the transition planning process if the member requests and/or approves, and such persons are willing and able to participate. As part of transition planning, prior to the member's physical move to the community, the Service Coordinator shall visit the residence where the member will live to conduct an on -site evaluation of the physical residence and meet with the member's family or other informal caregiver who will be residing with the member (as appropriate). The Service Coordinator shall include in the transition plan activities and/or services needed to mitigate any perceived risks in the residence including but not limited to an increase in face- to-face visits beyond the minimum required contacts. The transition plan shall address all services necessary to safely transition the member to the community and include at a minimum, member needs related to housing, transportation, availability of informal caregivers, and other transition needs and supports.

Only Service Coordinators operating on behalf of current Aged and Disabled waiver care mana gement entities will count towards the 50% requirement. Any Contractor employees who have previously been employed by a care management entity do not count towards meeting the 50% standard. The Contractor may exceed the 50% threshold and may partner will multiple waiver care management entities to meet the requirement. The State reserves the right to request ad- hoc reports and audit the Contractor's compliance with the 50% threshold at any time. If after the first two years of the program, the Contractor determines it will ramp down or cease subcontracting with care management entities for Service Coordination, it shall provide a transition plan to the State at least 90 days in advance of the expected transition date to ensure members experience no gaps in Service Coordination.

Each member will have an assigned Care Coordinator, and each of the Contractor's Care Coordinators may be assigned to multiple members. However, for members who are assigned to Complex Case Management according to the criteria in Section 4.2.2 , the Care Coordinator -to-member ratio will not exceed 1:50, unless otherwise approved in writing by the State. For member's residing in nursing facilities, the member's Care Coordinator shall serve as the main point - of-contact for nursing facilities regarding the member's care. The Contractor shall assign or designate at least one Care Coordinator to each nursing facility within the Contractor's network to serve institutional LTSS members and support streamlined communication and ongoing collaboration with facilities and facility -based resources. A single individual may serve as both a member's Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator, if that individual meets the requirements for both roles as described in Sections 4.13 and 4.14. Should a single individual serve both Care Coordinator and Service Coordinator functions, that individual may not have a caseload exceeding fifty (50) unique members at any given time. 129 4.16 Service Coordinator Caseload Requirements Each member who is determined NFLOC and receiving LTSS will have a Service Coordinator, in addition to an assigned Care Coordinator, and each of the Contractor's Service Coordinators may serve multiple members receiving LTSS. 4.16.1 Service Coordinator fo r NF Residents The State encourages the Contractor to assign or designate at least one Service Coordinator to each nursing facility within the Contractor's network to serve institutional LTSS members and support ongoing collaboration with facilities and facility -based resources. 4.16.2 Service Coordinator Mixed Caseload Requirements The average weighted Service Coordinator -to-member staffing ratio shall be no more than 1:100. Such average shall be derived by dividing the total number of full -time equivalent Service Coordinators by the total weighted value of members as delineated below. The required maximum caseload for any individual Service Coordinator is a weighted value of no more than one hundred (100) members. The Contractor shall use the following methodology to calculate weighted Service Coordinator -to-member staffing ratios and caseloads: Each member who is determined to be NFLOC and has resided in a nursing facility for ninety (90) or more days shall be factored into the weighted Service Coordinator -to- member staffing ratio and weighted caseload calculations utilizing an acuity level of one (1), EXCEPT that: o Upon completion of a Transition Assessment ( see Section 4.12.2), which indicates that a member is a candidate for transition to the community, such member shall be factored into the weighted caseload and staffing ratio calculations using an acuity level of two (2) until such time as the member is transitioned to the home or community or the member is no longer a candidate for transition. Each member who is determined to be NFLOC and receives LTSS in the home or community shall be factored into the weighted caseload and staffing ratio calculations utilizing an acuity level of two (2). If a mixed caseload is assigned, there can be no more than a weighted value of 100. The following formula is to be used in determining a Service Coordinator's mixed caseload: (# of members in an institutional setting x 1.0) + (# of members identified as candidates for transition to the community x 2) + (# of members in an HCBS setting x 2) = 100 or Less 4.17 Interdisciplinary Care Team (ICT) Under [ MLTSS Program Name], the Contractor must use an ICT for the coordination of care for each member assigned to the Complex Case Management level of service. Where there is no conflict with [MLTSS Program Name] requirements in this Section, the Contractor shall use its companion D -SNP's CMS -approved MOC to provide ICT services. In cases where the Contractor's companion D -SNP's CMS- approved MOC does not meet Indiana [ MLTSS Pr ogram Name] standards, the Contractor shall modify or adapt its companion D -SNP's CMS- approved MOC approaches to meet the requirements in Section 4.17 when delivering ICT services to [ MLTSS Program Name] members who are assigned to Complex Case Management. 130 4.17.1 ICT Participants For [MLTSS Program Name] members who qualify for an ICT, the Contractor must use an ICT skilled in nursing, social work and behavioral health, with knowledge of local community resources to implement protocol- driven care modules for members.

The Contractor shall offer braille as an alternative format for receiving member materials. When a member has requested materials in braille, the Contractor shall supply future materials in braille to the member. The Contractor may review with the member the specific document types the member wishes to receive in braille versus other formats. Unless a member specifically states their alternate- format request is a one- time request, the Contractor shall consider the request an ongoing request and supply all future mailed materials in the preferred format to the member. For first -time or one- time requests from a member, the Contractor shall mail the alternate version of the document in no more than seven (7) business days from the date of the request. If, for example, the member received a wellness visit reminder flyer and called the Contractor to ask for the flyer to be sent in braille, the Contractor shall take no more than seven (7) business days to mail the braille version from the date of the member request call. For first -time or one- time requests from a member, when the mailing is governed by NCQA or statutory requirements, the Contract shall have two (2) additional days from the NCQA or statutory timeframe to mail the document if no mailing has yet been sent to the member. For first -time or one- time requests from a member, when the mailing is governed by NCQA or statutory requirements and the statutory notice has already been fulfilled with a regular printed letter, the Contractor shall mail the alternate version of the document in no more than seven (7) business days from the date of the request.

If, for example, a member had previously requested materials in braille, and an ID card would be sent to the member in five (5) business days, the timeline would be seven (7) business days for the braille version. The additional two (2) days applies for Contract requirements (such as ID cards) and additional mailings at the will of the Contractor, such as a wellness visit reminder postcard. For existing on- going alternate format requests which must comply with NCQA or State law requirement, such as utilization management letters, the Contractor shall mail the documents in the alternate format within the statutory or NCQA required timeline.

The Contractor shall reimburse FQHCs and RHCs for services at no less than the level and amount of payment that the Contractor would make to a non- FQHC or non- RHC provider for the same services. In accordance with section 5006(d) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the Contractor shall pay any out -of-network Indian healthcare provider (see Section 6.2.10) that is a FQHC for covered services provided to an American Indian/Alaska Native member at a rate equal to the amount of payment that the Contractor would pay to an in- network FQHC that is not an Indian health care provider for the same services. In accordance with the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA), FSSA shall make supplemental payments to FQHCs and RHCs that subcontract (directly or indirectly) with the Contractor. These supplemental payments represent the difference, if any, between the payment to which the FQHC or RHC would be entitled for covered services under the Medicaid provisions of BIPA and the payments made by the Contractor. FSSA requires the Contractor to identify any performance incentives it offers to the F QHC or RHC. FSSA shall review and must approve any performance incentives. The Contractor shall report all such FQHC and RHC incentives which accrue during the Contract period related to the cost of providing FQHC -covered or RHC -covered services to its members along with any fee- for- service and/or capitation payments in the determination of the amount of direct reimbursement paid by the Contractor to the FQHC or RHC. If the incentives vary between the Contractor's [MLTSS Program Name] lines of business, the Contractor shall so specify in its reporting to FSSA. 175 The Contractor shall perform quarterly claim reconciliation with each contracted FQHC or RHC to identify and resolve any billing issues that may impact the clinic's annual reconciliation conducted by FSSA. FSSA requires the Contractor to provide the Contractor's utilization and reimbursement data for each FQHC and RHC in each month of the reporting period. The report shall be completed in the form and manner set forth in the MCE Reporting Manual, which is updated annually. The submitted FQHC and RHC data must be accurate and complete. The Contractor shall pull the data by NPI or LPI, rather than other means, such as a Federal Tax ID number. The Contractor shall establish a process for validating the completeness and accuracy of the data, and a description of this process shall be available to FSSA upon request. The claims files should not omit claims for practitioners rendering services at the clinic nor should the files contain claims for practitioners who did not practice at the clinic. In addition, FSSA requires the FQHC or RHC and the Contractor to maintain and submit records documenting the number and types of valid encounters provided to members each month. Capitated FQHCs and RHCs shall also submit encounter data (e.g., in the form of shadow claims to the Contractor) each month. The number of encounters will be subject to audit by FSSA or its representatives. The Contractor shall work with each FQHC and RHC in assisting FSSA and/or its designee in the resolution of disputes concerning year -end reconciliations between the federally required interim payments (made by FSSA to each FQHC and RHC on the basis of provider reported encounter activity) and the final accounting that is based on the actual encounter data provided by the Contractor. 6.2.10 Indian Healthcare Providers Section 5006 of ARRA provides certain protections for Indian health care providers in Medicaid. An Indian health care provider means a health care program, including providers of contract health services, operated by the Indian Health Service (IHS) or an Indian Tribe, Tribal Organization or Urban Indian Organization (I/T/U) as defined in section 4 of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (25 U.S.C. 1603). The Contractor shall offer to enter into contracts with Indian health care providers participating in Medicaid that reflect the provisions in this Section. 6.2.10.1 Access to Indian Healthcare Providers In accordance with section 5006(d) of ARRA, the Contractor shall: Permit any American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) enrollee who is eligible to receive services from a participating Indian healthcare provider to choose to receive covered services from that Indian healthcare provider, and if that Indian healthcare provider participates in the network as a PMP (if applicable), to choose that Indian healthcare provider as their PMP, as long as that Indian healthcare provider has the capacity to provide the service; Demonstrate that there are sufficient Indian healthcare providers in the Contractor's network to ensure timely access to services available under the Contract for AI/AN enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers. The Contractor shall be held to standards issued by CMS regarding sufficiency of Indian healthcare providers in states like Indiana where few Indian healthcare providers are available. In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.56(c) and \u00a7457.1212, in the event that timely access to Indian healthcare providers in network cannot be guaranteed due to few or no network participating Indian healthcare providers, the sufficiency standard is satisfied if: AI/AN enrollees, living on or off tribal lands, are permitted by the Contractor, to access out -of-state Indian healthcare providers; or 176 This circumstance is deemed a good cause reason under the managed care plan contract for AI/AN enrollees to disenroll from the managed care program into fee- for-service. In accordance with 42 CFR \u00a7438.14(b)(3): The Contractor shall not require any Service Authorization or impose any condition for an AI/AN enrollee to access services at such facilities. This includes the right of the AI/AN enrollee to choose an Indian Healthcare Provider as a Primary Care Provider, if the Indian Healthcare Provider is a network Provider. 6.2.10.2 Referrals from Indian Healthcare Providers When a physician in an Indian Healthcare facility refers an AI/AN enrollee to a Network Provider for services covered under this Contract, the Contractor shall not require the member to see a Primary Care Provider prior to the referral. The network Provider to whom the Indian Healthcare physician refers the member may determine that services are not Medically Necessary or not covered. 6.2.1 0.3 Tribal Assessments and Care Plans The Contractor will accept the results of home care service assessments, waiver assessments, reassessments and the resulting care plans developed by tribal assessors for AI/AN enrollees as determined by the tribe. Referrals to non- tribal providers for services resulting from the assessments must be made to providers within the Contractor's network. This applies to services requested by AI/AN enrollees residing on or off tribal land. 6.2.10.4 Tribal Training and Orientatio n The Contractor shall provide training and orientation materials to tribal governments upon request and shall make available training and orientation for any interested tribal governments. 6.2.10.5 Payment for Indian Healthcare Providers In accordance with section 5006(d) of ARRA, the Contractor shall: i. Reimburse Indian healthcare providers, whether in- or out -of-network, for covered services provided to AI/AN enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers either at a rate negotiated between the Contractor and the Indian healthcare provider, or if there is no negotiated rate, at a rate not less than the level and amount of payment that would be made if the services were provided by an in- network provider that is not an Indian healthcare provider . ii. Make prompt payment to all Indian healthcare providers as set forth in Section 9.7.3; and iii. N ot reduce payments to Indian healthcare providers, or other providers of contract health services under referral by an Indian healthcare provider, for covered services provided to an AI/AN enrollee by the amount of a copayment or other cost -sharing that would be due from the AI/AN enrollee if not otherwise prohibited under Section 5006(a) of ARRA. Section 5006(d) of ARRA requires that the State provide a supplemental payment to non-FQHC Indian healthcare providers for covered services provided to AI/AN enrollees. The amount of the supplemental payment is the difference, if any, of the rate 177 paid by the Contractor for the services and the rate that applies to the provision of such services under the State Plan, which is the encounter rate determined by IHS in the annual federal register notice. To the extent FSSA requires utilization and/or reimbursement data from the Contractor to make a supplemental payment to an Indian healthcare provider, the Contractor shall provide the requested data within thirty (30) calendar days of the request. 6.2.10.6 Cooperation The Contractor agrees to work cooperatively with the State, other MCEs under contract with the State, and tribal governments to find mutually agreeable mechanisms to implement this section including, but not limited to, a common notification form by which tribal governments may report referrals to the Contractor. 6.2.11 County Health Departments FSSA strongly encourages the Contractor to contract or enter into business agreements with any health departments that are willing to coordinate with the Contractor and are able to meet the Contractor's credentialing and service delivery requirements. 6.2.12 Urgent Care Clinics The Contractor shall affiliate or contract with urgent care clinics.

The member must be informed of the right to contact the Contractor to file an appeal if the member disagrees with the decision to deny authorization; e. The provider must inform the member of member responsibility for payment if the member chooses to or insists on receiving the services without authorization; 195 f.

The State may require the addition of up to six ( 6) supplemental state- specific questions. For all CAHPs surveys, the State will, at least one hundred and eighty ( 180) days prior to the administration of the survey, notify Contractor of the sample size and sampling methodology. The sampling methodology will be designed to oversample to allow for statistically representative measurement of equity by race/ethnicity, rural/urban status, Area Agency on Aging service region, and other factors. The Contractor shall have its sample validated by an NCQA -certified HEDIS Auditor. The sample size will be determined by the State b ased on CMS technical assistance, historic response rates, and the size of the target population. To increase response rates in order to meet the target number of completed surveys, the Contractor may oversample, send a pre- notification letter and/or postcard to enrollees to let them know they may be called to participate in the survey, and/or increase the number of call attempts made to enrollees on different days and at different times. The Contractor shall annually provide to the State the survey result from each independently - admi nistered CAHPs survey, as listed below. The Contractor shall provide survey results statewide stratified by, at minimum, Race, Ethnicity, Language. The Contractor shall also provide survey results by regions defined by the State. The State reserves the right to define additional stratification requirements. Each CAHPS survey must be based upon the NCQA methodology for sampling of CAHPS data. Required CAHPS surveys will include: o CAHPS Health Plan Survey o CAHPS Home and Community -Based Services Survey o CAHPS N ursing Home Survey (all three standardized surveys) The MCE's independently -administered CAHPS surveys listed above shall be conducted solely for Contractor's [ MLTSS Program Name] line of business. The Contractor's vendor must submit Member -level data fil es to NCQA for calculation of HEDIS CAHPS survey results. During the first year of the program, the State may direct the Contractor to conduct quarterly pulse surveys as designed by the State and based on a subset of the CAHPS survey tool, in order to facilitate regular rapid cycle feedback and quality improvement for the [ MLTSS Program Name] program. Topics such as utilization management performance, wait times for services, and culturally competent treatment may be considered for inclusion. The sample s ize will be determined by the State based on CMS technical assistance, historic response rates, and the size of the target population. To increase response rates in order to meet the target number of completed surveys, the Contractor may oversample, send a pre-notification letter and/or postcard to enrollees to let them know they may be called to participate in the survey, and/or increase the number of call attempts made to enrollees on different days and at different times. 7.2.2 National Core Indicators S urvey - Aging and Disabilities The State will conduct an annual quality of life survey for members enrolled in [MLTSS Program Name] using the National Core Indicators - Aging and Disabilities consumer survey. To support this effort, Contractor shall collect and report Pre- Survey and Background Information for each member in the sample (including the oversample) in accordance with instructions and timeframes 211 established by the State and otherwise cooperate with and support the State during the survey administration process. The survey may use sampling methodology designed to oversample by race/ethnicity, rural/urban status, MCE, Area Agency on Aging service region, and other factors. The Contractor may be required to review survey results and develop corrective action plans or quality improvement projects. 7.2.3 Caregiver Survey A statewide caregiver survey may be administered to measure key experience and quality of life indicators using best practices for reaching certain populations. The State reserves the right to administer the survey then provide survey results to each Contractor or to require each [ MLTSS Program Name] contractor to administer a caregiver survey using a standardized survey tool provided by the State. The Contractor must respond to data requests, adhere to sampling methodologies, and survey administration protocols, and otherwise cooperate with and support the State during the survey administration process. The State and Contractor shall analyze the findings to identify required performance improvement activities and shall make the findings available to stakeholders. The timing and approach to administering this survey will be determined by the State. The State will inform Contractor of the survey timing and approach at least ninety (90) days prior to survey administration. The conduct of a caregiver survey specific to enrollees in [ MLTSS Progra m Name] may be considered for future years. 7.2.4 Provider Surveys The Contractor may be required to administer provider satisfaction surveys. Details will be set forth in the MCE Reporting Manual. 7.2.5 Additional Surveys The State may require Contractor to conduct additional surveys to measure key experience and quality of life indicators using best practices for reaching certain populations. The State has the right to require Contractor to conduct additional pulse surveys based on CAHPS in future years. 7.3 Value Based Payment (VBP) 7.3.1 V BP Program Design The State will use Value Based Payment (VBP) as one tool in Indiana's [ MLTSS Program Name] quality framework to leverage the managed care model toward a health care system where members' experience and health outcomes are improved. VBP is defined as linking provider payment to improved performance by health care providers, in order to hold health care providers accountable for both the cost and quality of care they provide, attempt to reduce inappropriate care, and identify and reward the best -performing providers. Informed by national best practices, FSSA will design its VBP program to support progress in achieving the [MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals. The program will be implemented using a phased approach. Any VBP program design will be finalized no less than one hundred and eighty (180) days prior to the date on which it will be effective. The State reserves the right to establish VBP methodologies that Contractor, and all other [MLTSS Program Name] contractors, must implement. The VBP methodologies will be applied to home- and community -based services and nursing facility services, as well as to providers of 212 other covered services. The State also reserves the right to establish targets or minimum levels for Contractor's VBP provider participation rates. 7.3.2 VBP Program Participation The Contractor shall participate in the state- directed [MLTSS Program Name] VBP Program and shall support the program by contributing input for the design and ongoing development of the program, working together with the State, other [ MLTSS Program Name] contractors, the Aging and LTSS Advisory Committee, and other stakeholders. The Contractor shall reimburse nursing facilities in accordance with the Nursing Facility Quality Payment Program designed by the State. The State reserves the right to amend and redesign the Nursing Facility Quality Payment Program as needed. The Contractor shall support the State in actively helping to advance providers along the VBP continuum - consistent with the Health Care Payment Learning and Action Network framework - to advance value in the [ MLTSS Program Name] program. The Contractor shall also collaborate with the State on any multi- payer VBP activities. The Contractor shall also collaborate with the State to develop, implement, and continue to build upon, VBP arrangements, particularly in, but not limited to, the home- and community -based providers. The Contractor may establish additional VBP programs to supplement those directed by the State. The Contractor shall develop procedures to routinely assess VBP programs, state- directed or supplemental, for unintended consequences that perpetuate or increase health disparities and make modifications as needed. 7.3.3 VBP Metrics and Reporting The Contractor shall routinely collect, update, report, and reconcile to the State, data on Contractor's efforts and progress towards achieving the goals of the [ MLTSS Program Name] VBP Program. Contractor shall also submit reports for any additional Contractor -defined VBP arrangements, as applicable. The State may require the health plan to align standard metrics and reporting for providers participating in a VBP agreement with other federal or community programmatic required metrics and reporting to reduce administrative burden for the provider community. The Contractor w ill provide technical assistance to participating providers to support and increase provider VBP capabilities, including data collection, reporting, and analytics. 7.4 Pay- for-Outcomes Quality Incentive Programs FSSA shall require Contractors to participate in a pay for outcomes (P4O) program that focuses on rewarding Contractors' efforts to improve quality and outcomes for [ MLTSS Program Name] members. The P4O program will at a minimum incentivize objectives that support the Program Quality Goals but may be used to support additional State goals. FSSA shall provide, at minimum, financial performance incentives to Contractors based on performance targets in priority areas established by the State. The Contractor incentives and performance targets will be set forth in Exhibit 2. The State shall have the right to revise P4O measures on an annual basis. Incentive payment performance may be made available to stakeholders under the same terms of performance, or the public. In Years Two ( 2) through Four (4) and possible contract extension years of the State Contract, the State shall also have the right to require Contractor to invest a portion of the P4O payment in infrastructure that supports the [ MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals or to distribute a portion of the P4O payment to its network providers in support of the [ MLTSS Program Name] Quality Goals. The State will notify Contractor of such requirements at least one hundred and eighty ( 180) days before their effective date. 213 Additional conditions to payment of incentive amounts are provided in Exhibit 2. In addition to P4O, the State reserves the right to adjust the auto- assignment algorithm or add criteria including but not limited to quality measures or cost or utilization management performance, by means including but not limited to the following: o Years Two ( 2) through Four (4) and possible contract extension years: To reflect Contractor's performance on Pay -for-Outcomes measures based on a methodology to be specified by the State no later than ninety ( 90) days after the Contract effective date. May be adjusted to reflect preference for contractors that are determined to be noncompliant with the prior or current year's quality program workplans and to exclude those that are subject to Corrective Action Plans. 7.5 Provider Feedback Reporting and Technical Assistance The Contractor must provide training and technical assistance, publish provider feedback reports, and build infrastructure to help all of its network providers prepare for, and engage in, its quality improvement program and in any VBP programs. Training must occur upon provider onboarding as well as at least annually, or as needed to address provider questions or issues. At a minimum, such training shall inform network providers about the [MLTSS Program Name] Quality Program Goals and the provider's role in contributing to the achievement of these goals. 7.5.1 Technical assistance components Technical assistance to participating providers must, at a minimum, support the provider in: Understanding provider feedback quality and utilization reports and supporting provider capabilities to meet performance improvement targets Understand and assess members' social determinants of health (SDOH) and connecting with social services providers to address member and informal caregiver SDOH needs. 7.5.2 Jointly developed technical assistance Contractor will jointly develop certain types of technical assistance programs, as follows. The Contractor will collaborate with FSSA and other [ MLTSS Program Name] contractors to: o Provide training and technical assistance, and build infrastructure to help network providers prepare for, and engage in, VBP (including how to utilize feedback reports, best practices for practice adoption of VBP engagement strategies and use of Contractor's provider tools, staff training strategies, and effective patient engagement approaches, etc.); o Establish a core set of measures that will be included in all provider feedback reports, standardized across all [ MLTSS Program Name] Contractors issuing the feedback reports; o Provide targeted training related to particular quality improvement initiatives, including but not limited to establishing an HCBS provider learning network to support network providers, as they prepare for, adopt, and adapt to VBP arrangements; o Support providers in understanding and assessing SDOH, and connecting with social services providers to address member and informal caregiver SDOH needs; and o Support providers in addressing Direct Service Professionals workforce development, in coordination with the State, including supporting the State's efforts as conducted under the HCBS Spending Plan 214 Contractor will be required to submit quarterly reports to FSSA to show total trainings completed, percent of network reached, topics covered, a nd other report elements as defined by the State as noted in the Reporting Manual. 7.6 Provider Incentive Programs Contractors may establish a performance- based incentive system for its providers for Contractor's [MLTSS Program Name] providers. The Contractor may determine its own methodology for incentivizing providers. The provider incentive programs shall, at a minimum, include incentives that are aligned with all of the [ MLTSS program name] Program Quality Goals. Contractor may offer additional provider incentives targeting additional areas of performance to support the needs of its membership, but such additions should be evidence- based, and the needs documented based on clinical data, provider performance, or other relevant data. The Contractor must obtain FSSA approval at least 30 days prior to implementing any provider incentive program and before making any changes thereto. The State encourages creativity in designing pay for performance programs, consistent with the requirements below. If Contractor offers financial incentives to providers, these payments shall be above and beyond the standard Medicaid fee- for-service fee schedule. Section 1876(i)(8) of the Social Security Act and federal regulations 42 CFR 438.10(f)(3), 42 CFR 422.208 and 42 CFR 422.210 provide information regarding physician incentive plans. The Contractor shall comply with all federal regulations regarding the physician incentive plan and supply to FSSA information on its plan as required in the regulations and with sufficient detail to permit FSSA to determine whether the incentive plan complies with the federal requirements. The Contractor shall provide information concerning its physician incentive plan, upon request, to its members and in any marketing materi als in accordance with the disclosure requirements stipulated in the federal regulations. Similar requirements apply to subcontracting arrangements with physician groups and intermediate entities. Physician incentive plans shall comply with the following requirements: The Contractor shall make no specific payment directly or indirectly to a physician or physician group as an inducement to reduce or limit medically necessary services furnished to an individual member; and The Contractor shall meet requirements for stop- loss protection, member survey and disclosure requirements under 42 CFR 438.10(f)(3). For any provider incentives offered, Contractor must collect data and assess the impact of the incentives toward achieving their intended purpose. Results of the impacts achieved must be included in quality workplan updates and program reports to the State. The State reserves the right to prospectively end its approval of a Contractor 's provider incentive based on these results. 7.7 Member Incentive Programs Contractor's member incentive programs must be directly related to improving health outcomes or quality of life. Member incentives may be financial or non- financial. The Contractor must obtain FSSA approval at least 30 days prior to implementing any member incentive program and before making any changes thereto. The State encourages creativity in designing member incentive programs, consistent with the requirements below. Examples of appropriate Member Incentives could include gift certificates for groceries; phone cards; or gifts such as exercise equipment, first aid kits, or personal care items. For any member incentives offered, the Contractor must collect data and assess the impact of the incentives toward achieving their intended purpose. Results of the impacts achieved must be included in 215 quality workplan updates and program reports to the State. The State reserves the right to prospectively end its approval of a Contractor's member incentive based on these results. Except as provided herein, Contractor may not offer gifts or incentives greater than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each incentive, unless an exception is approved by FSSA. The Contractor may petition FSSA, in the manner prescribed by FSSA, for authorization to offer items or incentives greater than one hundred dollars ( $100.00) Such incentives may not be disproportionate to the value of the service provided, as determined by FSSA. Petitions to provide enhanced ince ntives for preventive care shall be reviewed on a case- by-case basis, and FSSA shall retain full discretion in determining whether the enhanced incentives will be approved. In any member incentive program, the incentives shall be tied directly to improving health outcomes or quality of life. For example, the member incentive programs can encourage annual health screenings and well -visits. Contractors may use incentives to encourage participation in Population Health programs. Contractors should develop member incentives designed to encourage appropriate utilization of health care services and long- term services and supports, increase adherence to keeping medical appointments and encourage the receipt of health care services in the appropriate treatment setting. Additionally, Contractor shall comply with those requirements found in 42 CFR 1003.101: \"Remuneration... (4) Incentives given to individuals to promote the delivery of preventive care services where the delivery of such services is not tied (directly or indirectly) to the provision of other services reimbursed in whole or in part by Medicare or an applicable State health care program. Such incentives may include the provision of preventive care, but may not include\u2014 o Cash or instruments convertible to cash; or o An incentive the value of which is disproportionally large in relationship to the value of the preventive care service ( i.e., either the value of the service itself or the future health care costs reasonably expected to be avoided as a result of the preventive care) ...\" 7.7.1 Required Member Incentives Contractors shall establish, at a minimum, one member incentive program aligned with each of the [MLTSS Program Name] Program Quality Goals. 7.7.2 Optional Member Incentives Contractor may offer additional member incentives targeting additional areas of performance to support the needs of its membership, but such additions should be evidence- based, and the needs documented based on clinical data, member and informal caregiver needs and wants, or other relevant data. Contractor will determine its own methodology for providing incentives to members. For example, Contractor may offer additional member incentives for: o Obtaining recommended preventive care (including dental); o Complying with treatment in a prevention and wellness programs, care management or complex case management program; o Making healthy lifestyle decisions such as quitting smoking or losing weight; or o Completing a health screening. 216 7.8 Utilization Management Program The Contractor must operate and maintain its own utilization management program. The Contractor shall include utilization management measurements in their Quality Management and Improvement Program Work Plan as set forth in Section 7.1.2. The Contractor's utilization management program shall not be limited to traditional utilization management activities, such as prior authorization. The Contractor must maintain a utilization management program that integrates with other functional units as appropriate and supports the Quality Management and Improvement Program. The utilization management program must have policies and procedures and systems in place to assist utilization management staff to identify instances of over - and under -utilization of Emergency room services, non- emergency medical transportation services and other health care services, identify aberrant provider practice patterns (especially related to Emergency room, inpatient services, transportation, drug utilization, preventive care and screening exams), ensure active participation of a utilization review committee, evaluate efficiency and appropriateness of service delivery, incorporate subcontractor's performance data, facilitate program management and long- term quality and identify critical quality of care issues. The Contractor's utilization management program must link members to prevention and wellness programs(s) , care management , complex case management and service coordination, as set forth in Section 4.0. This includes, but is not limited to, integrating prior authorization requests for the identification of members with real- time clinical needs. The Contractor's utilization management program must also encourage health literacy and informed, responsible medical decision making. For example, Contractors should develop member incentives designed to encourage appropriate utilization of health care services, increase adherence to keeping medical appointments and obtain services in the appropriate treatment setting. Contractors shall also be responsible for identifying and addressing social barriers which may inhibit a member's ability to obtain preventive care. The Contractor shall monitor utilization through retrospective reviews and will identify areas of high and low utilization and identify key reasons for the utilization patterns. The Contractor must identify those members that are high utilizers of Emergency room services and/or other services, including pharmacy, and perform the necessary outreach and sc reening to assure the member's services are coordinated and that the member is aware of and participating in the appropriate prevention and wellness programs(s) , care coordination or complex care management services. The Contractor must also use this data to identify additional prevention and wellness programs that are needed. Any member with Emergency room utilization must be outreached to again offer complex case management or care coordination. The Contractor may use the Right Choices Program (RCP), as described in Section 4 .2.4, in identifying members to refer to prevention and wellness programs(s), care coordination or complex case management. The Contractor must identify members with high utilization of controlled substances following the policies and procedures of the Right Choices Program (RCP), as described in Section 4.2.4. As part of its utilization review, the Contractor shall monitor access to preventive care, specifically to identify members who are not accessing preventive care services in accordance with accepted preventive care standards. The Contractor must develop education, incentives and outreach plans tailored to its member population to increase member compliance with preventive care standards. The Contractor shall not delegate utilization management functions or responsibilities to subcontractors with the exception of pharmacy, vision, and/or dental. Subcontracts are subject to State approval. If the Contractor delegates some of its prior authorization function to subcontractors, the Contractor must conduct annual audits and ongoing monitoring to ensure the subcontractor's performance complies with the Contract, the Contractor's policies and procedures and state and federal law. 217 7.8.1 Utilization Management Staffing and Training Utilization management staff must receive ongoing training regarding interpretation and application of the utilization management guidelines. The Contractor must be prepared to provide a written training plan, which shall include dates and subject matter, as well as training materials, upon request by FSSA. The State reserves the right to standardize certain parts of the prior authorization reporting process across the Contractors, such as requiring the Contractors to adopt and apply the same definitions regarding pended, denied, suspended claims, etc. When adopted, these standards shall be set forth in the Reporting Manual. The Contractor shall staff and operate a utilization management helpline at a minimum during business hours. The helpline staff shall be equipped to provide customer service to providers with authorization and coverage questions and authorize post -emergency department stabilization services. When the Contractor conducts a prudent layperson review to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists, the reviewer must not have more than a high school education and must not have training in a medical, nursing or social work -related field. Clinical professionals who have appropriate clinical expertise in the treatment of a member's condition or disease must make all decisions to deny a service authorization request (a request for the provision of a service by or on behalf of a member) or to authorize a service in an amount, duration or scope that is less than requested. The Contractor shall have a full time Geriatrician on staff or physician with ten (10) years of clinical practice with older adults with oversight of utilization management to review all denials of prior authorization requests. Only physicians and nurses licensed in Indiana may deny a service authorization request or authorize a service in an amount, duration or scope that is less than requested. The Contractor shall not provide incentives to utilization management staff or to providers for denying, limiting or discontinuing medically necessary services. FSSA may audit Contractor denials, appeals and authorization requests. The Contractor shall adhere to the requirements and timelines for prior authorization as described in Section 3.22 regarding t ransitions and Continuity of Care. FSSA may waive certain administrative requirements, including prior authorization procedures, to the extent that such waivers are allowed by law and are consistent with policy objectives. The Contractor may be required to comply with such waivers and will be provided with prior notice by FSSA. 7.8.2 Medical Service and Pharmacy Prior Authorization (Non -HCBS services) The Contractor may place appropriate limits on coverage on the basis of medical necessity, provided the services furnished can reasonably be expected to achieve their purpose. The Contractor is prohibited from arbitrarily denying or reducing the amount, duration or scope of required services solely because of diagnosis, type of illness or condition. The Contractor shall consider the status of the member when determining the amount or duration of services to approve, taking into consideration that individuals in this program are likely to need long- term therapies to maintain their current health and activities. The Contractor shall not use improvement in function as a criteria for approving continuation of services that enable the member to maintain their health status or prevent the member from experiencing a more significant decline. The Contractor will not refer members to publicly supported health care resources as a means of avoiding costs. For select IHCP published criteria or practice guidelines, as identified by the State, the Contractor's utilization management program cannot be more restrictive than the fee- for-service criteria and guidelines. The Contractor shall engage with the State to review already published medically necessary prior authorization criteria. The State reserves the right to further standardize 218 prior authorization criteria, processes, administrative processes, forms/documentation and/or to require the use of a single prior authorization portal across Contractors. The Contractor must use non- company customized versions of MCG and InterQual or other commercially available criteria when such products are used for utilization management reviews. The Contractor is expected to always use MCG and InterQual for the following utilization management reviews: acute inpatient, skilled nursing facility, acute inpatient rehabilitation, long-term acute care facility and behavioral health inpatient. For areas not addressed by IHCP criteria and MCG/InterQual, the Contractor may develop their own practice guidelines and criteria, but it must be approved by the State and made available to the State. The Contractor must establish and maintain medical management criteria and practice guidelines in accordance with State and federal regulations that are based on valid and reliable clinical evidence or consensus among clinical professionals and consider individual member needs. Pursuant to 42 CFR 438.210(b), the Contractor must consult with contracting health care professionals in developing practice guidelines and must have mechanisms in place to ensure consistent application of review criteria for authorization decisions and consult with the provider that requested the services when appropriate. Practice guidelines and criteria must be submitted to the State for approval prior to implementation by the Contractor through the standard document review process. The Contractor must periodically review and update the guidelines and post the guidelines on their website for member and provider viewing. If the Contractor chooses to utilize separate guidelines for physical health and behavioral health services, the Contractor shall demonstrate that the use of separate guidelines would have no negative impact on members and would not otherwise violate the Contractor's requirements under the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Parity Act (MHPAEA) as required by 42 CFR 438.910(d). 7.8.3 Special Consideration for Long Term Services and Supports (LTSS)Service Authorization The Contractor may not interfere with the member's setting of choice once level of care is determined. For example, if a member is determined eligible for nursing facility level of care including the necessary PASSR approval, the Contractor may not deny an authorization for the member to receive necessary care in a nursing facility. Likewise, the Contractor may not deny an authorization for that same member to receive the necessary care at home instead of in a facility. This requirement only applies to a member's general preference towards facility versus non-facility care. This section does not limit the Contractor's ability to steer members to in- network providers. 7.8.4 Special Consideration for Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) Service Authorization The Contractor's utilization management program shall include distinct policies and procedures regarding Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) and shall specify the responsibilities and scope of authority of Service Coordinators in authorizing LTSS and HCBS. The Contractor's prior authorization processes should support the provision of timely services to members and administrative efficiencies for providers with less duplication of effort and more coordinated and integrated processes and systems. The Contractor shall authorize LTSS and HCBS based on an enrollee's current needs assessment and consistent with the person- centered service plan in accordance with 42 CFR 438.210(b)(2)(iii). The prior authorization of HCBS covered benefits and services shall follow the policies and procedures as described in Section 4.0 Care Coordination. The Contractor may not require a provider to submit an additional authorization for services present in the member's person- centered service plan (the service plan is the authorization). The Contractor shall alert the relevant provider of the services approved in the person- centered service plan using the timelines specified for utilization management approvals and denials. 219 7.8.5 A uthorization of Services and Notices of Actions The Contractor shall have in place and follow written policies and procedures for processing authorization requests for initial and continuing authorizations of services as required by 42 CFR 438.210(b)(1). The Contractor's utilization management program policies and procedures must meet all state and federal regulations and current NCQA standards and must include appropriate timeframes for: a. Completing initial requests for prior authorization of services; b. Completing initial determinations of medical necessity; c. Completing provider and member appeals and expedited appeals for prior authorization of service requests or determinations of medical necessity, per state law; d. Notifying providers and members in writing of the Contractor's decisions on initial prior authorization requests and determinations of medical necessity following FSSA forms and templates; and e. Notifying providers and members of the Contractor's decisions on appeals and expedited appeals of prior authorization requests and determinations of medical necessity. The Contractor must provide a written notice to the member and provider of any decision to deny a service authorization request, or to authorize a service in an amount, duration or scope that is less than requested. For members enrolled in an aligned DSNP the Contractor must send a single integrated decision notice in accordance with the requirements in 42 CFR 422.629. The notice must meet the requirements of 42 CFR 438.404. The notice to members must be provided at a fifth- grade reading level. The notice must be given within the timeframes described in the following paragraphs and 42 CFR 438.404(c), specifically: a. Unless otherwise provided in 405 IAC 5-3- 14 or 42 CFR 438.210(d)(1), to require a shorter timeframe, the Contractor must notify members of standard authorization decisions not pertaining to medications as expeditiously as required by the member's health condition, not to exceed seven (7) calendar days after the request for services. An extension of up to fourteen (14) calendar days is permitted if the member or provider requests an extension or if the Contractor justifies to FSSA a need for more information and explains how the extension is in the member's best interest. The Contractor will be required to provide its justification to FSSA upon request. Extensions require written notice to the member and must include the reason for the extension and the member's right to file a grievance. b. Unless otherwise provided in 405 IAC 5-3- 14, if the Contractor fails to respond to a member's prior authorization request not pertaining to medications within seven (7) calendar days of receiving all necessary documentation, the authorization is deemed to be granted. c. For authorizations originally approved by the Contractor, if the Contractor denies continuation of services with the skilled nursing facility or long- term attendant care the Contractor must provide at least five (5) days of coverage for the services from the date of the notice of denial, to ensure the safe discharge of the member. This requirement does not apply for authorizations submitted untimely by the provider. d. For situations in which a provider indicates, or the Contractor determines, that following the standard timeframe could seriously jeopardize the member's life or health or ability to attain, mainta in or regain maximum function, the Contractor shall make an expedited authorization decision and provide notice as expeditiously as the member's health condition requires and no later than forty -eight (48) hours after receipt of the request for service. Th e Contractor may extend the forty -eight (48) hours by up to fourteen (14) calendar days if the member requests an extension or the Contractor justifies a need for 220 additional information and how the extension is in the best interest of the member. The Contr actor will be required to provide its justification to FSSA upon request. e. For requests related to HCBS, the contractor shall make an expedited authorization decision and notice to the member within 24 hours of the decision to deny authorization for service s contained in the member's Service Plan. Under no conditions may the Contractor extend that timeframe. f. If the Contractor extends the timeframe in accordance with 42 CFR 438.210(d)(1), it must give the member written notice of the reason for the decision to extend the timeframe and inform the member of the right to file a grievance if they disagree with that decision; and issue and carry out its determination as expeditiously as the member's health condition requires and no later than the date the extension expires. g. For concurrent reviews within 72 hours of a non- urgent request and within 1 business day of an urgent request. h. For decisions to terminate, suspend or reduce previously authorized covered services at least ten (10) business days before the date of action, with the following exceptions: 1. Notice is shortened to five (5) business days if probable member fraud has been verified by the Indiana Office of the Inspector General or Attorney General. 2. Exceptions detailed in in 42 CFR 431.213 and 431.214 3. Notice may occur no later than the date of the action in the event of: a. The death of a member; b. The Contractor's receipt of a signed written statement from the member requesting service termination or giving information requiring termination or reduction of services (the member must understand the result of supplying this information); c. The member's admission to an institution; d. The member's address is unknown and mail directed to him/her has no forwarding address; e. The member's acceptance for Medicaid services by another local jurisdiction; f. The member's physician prescribes the change in the level of medical care; g. An adverse determination made with regard to the preadmission screening requirements for nursing facility admissions; or h. The safety or health of individuals in the facility would be endangered, the member's health improves sufficiently to allow a more immediate transfer or discharge, an immediate transfer or discharge is required by the member's urgent medical needs or a member has not resided in the nursing facility for thirty (30) calendar days (applies only to adverse actions for nursing facility transfers). i. The Contractor shall have staff available on weekends to ensure that utilization management decisions and notifications and delivered in the timelines required in this scope of work. Contractor timeliness shall be an area of enhanced auditing by the State. The Contractor may not retroactively deny authorization for the continuation of care unless the provider submitted the authorization untimely. The notification letters used by the Contractor must be approved by FSSA prior to use and clearly explain the f ollowing: o The qualifications of the reviewer; o The guidelines used and reason for denial or approval; o The action the Contractor or its contractor has taken or intends to take; 221 o The reasons for the action; o The member's right to file an appeal with the Contractor and the process for doing so; o After the member has exhausted the Contractor's appeal process, the notice must contain the member's right to request an FSSA Fair Hearing and the process for doing so; o Circumstances under which expedited resolution is available and how to request it; and o The member's right to have benefits continue pending the resolution of the appeal, how to request continued benefits and the circumstances under which the member may have to pay the costs of these services; and o The provider's right for a peer -to-peer utilization review conversation with the reviewer including the process for scheduling a peer -to-peer utilization review conversation and that the provider has fifteen (15) business days request a peer - to-peer conversati on. A provider must be able to schedule a specific date and time for the peer -to-peer conversation to occur. The Contractor must report its medical necessity determination decisions, in a manner prescribed by the Reporting Manual. 7.8.6 Authorization Systems and Technology The Contractor must accept the universal prior authorization forms established by the State with no additional information besides clinical documentation necessary to make the determination. Additionally, providers must be able to submit prior authorization, concurrent reviews, retrospective reviews, and appeals of decisions in an electronic format via a web- based system accessible through the Contractor's website. The web- based system should mimic the fields on the universal prior authorization forms established by the State and not require additional information. The Contractor's web- based system should use automation and built -in system logic (e.g., member information pre- population, and smart editing to reduce errors) to reduce admini strative burden on providers.

FSSA reserves the right to amend the 834 Companion Guide during the Contract term. The current 834 Companion Guide is provided in the Bidders' Library as an example only. The Contractor is responsible for loading the eligibility information into its claims system within five (5) calendar days of receipt. In addition, the Contractor's IT systems must accommodate the State's member identification number (MID) for each member and the master client index (MCI). The Contractor's information systems must accommodate the State's 12- digit member identification number (MID) for each member. 9.5 Provider Network Data The Contractor shall submit provider network information to the State fiscal agent via the IHCP Provider Healthcare Portal. The Contractor shall keep provider enrollment and disenrollment information up- to- date. The Contractor shall enter updates into the Portal no less frequently than on the 1st and 15th day of each month, or as otherwise directed by the State. More information regarding provider network data will be available in the [MLTSS Program Name] Policies and Procedures Manual. The Contractor must provide single sign- on for providers to access the Provider Healthcare Portal. 9.6 Health Information Technology and Interoperability Contracts shall comply with requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), including, but not limited to, the transactions and code sets, privacy, security, and identifier regulations. Compliance includes meeting all required transaction formats and code sets with the specified data sharing agreements required under the regulations. Contractors shall transmit/receive from/to its providers, subcontractors, clearinghouses, and the State all transactions and code sets required by the 236 HIPAA/HITECH regulations in the appropriate standard formats, utilizing appropriate and adequate safeguards. Contractors shall: a. Create and adopt policies and procedures to periodically audit adherence to all HIPAA/HITECH regulations, and for which Contractor acknowledges and promises to perform, including but not limited to, the following obligations and actions: b. Create and implement policies and procedures to address present and future HIPAA/HITECH regulatory requirements as needed, including, but not limited to: use and disclosure of data; de- identification of data; minimum necessary access; accounting of disclosures; enrollee's right to amend, access, request restrictions; notice of privacy practices and right to file a complaint, and breach notification; c. Provide an appropriate level of training to its staff and employees regarding HIPAA/HITECH - related policies, procedures, enrollee rights and penalties prior to the HIPAA/HITECH implementation deadlines and at appropriate intervals thereafter; d. Track training of Contractor staff and employees and maintain signed acknowledgements by staff and employees of the Contractor's HIPAA/HITECH policies; e. Obtain a third (3rd) party certification of their HIPAA standard transaction compliance ninety (90) calendar days before the start date of operations, if applicable, and upon request by the State. f. Notify FSSA within one (1) business day upon discovery of a HIPAA or other security breach. Contractors are required to implement and maintain systems that meet the CMS Interoperability and Patient Access requirements in 42 CFR 438.10 introduced in the Interoperability and Patient Access Final Rule. This includes but is not limited to patient access and provider directory APIs and payer to payer data exchanges. Contractors should develop, implement and participate in HIT and data sharing initiatives in order to improve the quality, efficiency and safety of health care delivery in Indiana. The Contractor shall also cooperate and participate in the development and implementation of future FSSA -driven HIT initiatives. The Contractor shall join and maintain access to the Indiana Health Information Exchange (IHIE) to enhance its capacity and effectiveness in coordinating care for members as well as drive ongoing improvement to service transparency. The State reserves the right to require the Contractor to provide updates on how the Contractor is utilizing IHIE (e.g., Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) Alerts or CareWeb for care management purposes). The State reserves the right to require the Contractor to integrate utilization of IHIE into its practices with reasonable advance notice. Contractors should develop and collaborate on strategies to participate and motivate non- participating providers to take part in and benefit from HIT. Strategies may include contractually requiring providers to participate and/or offering subsidized funding or other non- financial incentives. The following are examples of HIT initiatives that the Contractor should actively be involved in, or otherwise have a plan to participate in: a. Electronic Medical Record (EMR). An electronic health record is a digital version of a patient's paper chart that contains medical and treatment histories of patients. E MRs are real - time patient centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. They are built to share information with other health care providers and organizations in order to coordinate information for and from all clinicians involved in a patient's care such as: medical history, diagnoses, medications, treatment plans, immunization dates, allergies, radiology images, and laboratory and test results. Appropriate technical, administrative, and physical safeguards should also be in place to protect patient health information contained in the E MR. To ensure interoperability among providers including laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, inpatient hospital/surgery center, outpatient clinical 237 care, home health, public health and others, organizations at the national level (including the Health IT Standards Panel and the Certification Commission for Health IT) are working to develop standards related to IT architecture, messaging, coding, and privacy/security and a certification process for technologies. The Contractor is strongly encouraged to use these standards in developing their electronic data sharing initiatives. b. Electronic Prescribing. Electronic Prescribing is the ability to generate and transmit permissible prescriptions electronically. In 2017 Indiana implemented a statewide, comprehensive platform for healthcare professionals to review patients' controlled- substance prescription history more quickly and efficiently. This platform supports Indiana's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (INSPECT) and transfers data into electronic health records and pharmacy management systems. Statewide integration of the INSPECT platform is a key component of Indiana's ongoing efforts to attack the opioid crisis. c. Inpatient C omputerized Provider O rder E ntry (CPOE). CPOE refers to a computer -based system of ordering diagnostic and treatment services, including laboratory, radiology and medications. A basic CPOE system promotes legible and complete order entry and can provide basic clinical decision support such as suggestions for drug doses and frequencies. More advanced CPOE systems can integrate with an EMR for access to a patient's medical history. d. Health Information Exchanges (including regional health information organizations - RHIOs). These exchanges, such as the Indiana Health Information Exchange, allow participating providers to exchange clinical data electronically. The capacity of health information exchanges varies. Some initiatives provide electronic access only to lab or radiology results, while others offer access to shared, fully integrated medical records. e. Benchmarking. Contractors can pool data from multiple providers and \"benchmark\" or compare metrics related to outcomes, utilization of services and populations. Practice pattern analysis, with appropriate risk adjustment, can help to identify differences in treatment of patients and best practices. Information can be shared with Contractors and providers to help them identify opportunities for improvement or can be linked to pay for performance initiatives. f. Telehealth . Telehealth allows provider -to-provider and provider -to-member live interactions and is especially useful in situations where members do not have easy access to a provider, such as for members in rural areas. Providers also use telehealth to consult with each other and share their expertise for the benefit of treating complex patients in [MLTSS Program Name] . Contractors develop reimbursement mechanisms to encourage appropriate use of telehealth. g. Mobile and Self -Service Technology. The Contractor is encouraged to utilize mobile and self-service technology in delivering services to members. This includes, but is not limited to, remote monitoring devices to enable members to record health measures for delivery to the Contractor and/or physician practices and medication and appointment reminders through personalized voice or text messages. h. Admission, Discharge, and Transfer (ADT) alerts . ADT alerts are automatic electronic notifications of admissions, discharges, and transfers that are sent to a patient's primary care physician or other healthcare provider. Implementing ADT alerts help to reduce avoidable hospital readmissions and improves care transitions and coordination. The Contractor will promote provider utilization of ADT alerts and integrate their monitoring into health plan operations and delivery of care. 238 9.7 Claims Processing 9.7.1 Claims Processing Capability The Contractor shall comply with Section 6504(a) of the ACA, which requires that state claims processing and retrieval systems are able to collect data elements necessary to enable the mechanized claims processing and information retrieval systems to meet the requirements of section 1903( r)(1)(F) of the Act [42 CFR 438.242(b)(1); Section ACA; section 1903(r)(1)(F) of the Act] . The Contractor shall demonstrate and maintain the capability to process and pay provider claims for services rendered to the Contractor's members, in compliance with HIPAA, including National Provider Identifier (NPI) requirements.

Communication to both in and out -of-network providers shall be effective and efficient, aiming to simplify and streamline the provider experience. Contractors shall continually assess administrative billing requirements to identify onerous practices in need of change. Contractors shall employ a local Provider Claims Educator as specified in Section 2.4 to work collaboratively to educate LTSS providers transitioning from fee- for-service reimbursement to managed care. The Contractor shall implement claim requirements and processing rules that are consistent with IHCP manuals , modules , and bulletins . The Contractor must audit and test the claims processing system to ensure the correct use of HCBS procedure codes and modifiers for services included in the LTSS program and adhere to other auditing requirements as noted in Section 9.7.7. The Contractor shall offer provider participation in testing and auditing for accurate payment to LTSS providers. Contractors shall report to FSSA on their collaborative efforts at least ninety (90) days prior to initial contract implementation. In accordance with Section 2. 9, FSSA must pre -approve the Contractor's delegation of any claims processi ng function to a subcontractor, such as but not limited to a Dental Benefits Manager or Transportation Broker. The Contractor must submit a request and a plan of implementation to FSSA at least sixty (60) days prior to planned implementation and secure FSSA's approval of any change to sub- contracting arrangements for claims processing. The Contractor shall use all applicable National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits in the processing of claims, except where State policy requires payment methodologies that contradict with NCCI edits. The Contractor shall use code sets and standards established and maintained by FSSA.

The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures for registering and responding to claims disputes for both in- network and out -of-network providers, in accordance with the claims dispute resolution process for non- contracted providers outlined in 405 IAC 1- 1.6 and as required in Section 6.11.3 Provider Dispute Resolution. Provider advances, loans, and loan guarantees over $50,000 per Provider Tax Identification Number (TIN) within a contract year, shall be submitted to FSSA for approval prior to payment. The request shall include a letter of explanation including the provider name and ID number, cause resulting in the need, including any mitigation strategies implemented prior to the request, 239 process for repayment including timeline, corrective action that will be implemented to avoid future occurrences, the total advance or loan amount and range of dates for the impacted claims. 9.7.2 Compliance with State and Federal Claims Processing Regulations The Contractor shall have a claims processing system to support electronic claims submission for both in- and out -of-network providers. The Contractor's system must process all claim types such as professional and institutional claims. The Contractor shall comply with the claims processing standards and confidentiality standards under IC 12- 15-13-1.6 and IC 12- 15-13-1.7, IHCP claim processing set up detailed in modules, banners, and bulletins, and any applicable federal regulations, including HIPAA regulations related to the confidentiality and submission requirements for protected health information (PHI). Additionally, the Contractor must permit the ICD code R69 is an acceptable diagnosis code for members receiving Home and Community Based Services through the HCBS. The Contractor shall ensure that communication with providers, particul arly out -of-network providers, and submission requirements are efficient and not burdensome for any providers. The Contractor shall be prohibited from requiring out -of-network providers to establish a Contractor - specific provider number to receive payment for claims submitted. The Contractor shall not require providers to bill using any number other than the FSSA assigned Member ID number. 9.7.3 Claims Payment Timelines The Contr actor shall pay providers for covered medically necessary services rendered to the Contractor's members in accordance with the standards set forth in IC 12- 15-13-1.5, 12- 15-13- 1.6 and IC 12- 15-13-1.7, unless the Contractor and provider agree to an alternate payment schedule and method. The Contractor shall also abide by the specifications of 42 CFR 447.45(d)(5) and (d)(6), which require the Contractor to ensure that the date of receipt is the date the Contractor receives the claim, as indicated by its date stamp on the claim; and that the date of payment is the date of the check or other form of payment. The Contractor shall pay or deny electronically filed clean claims within twenty -one (21) calendar days of receipt. A \"clean claim\" is one in which all information required for processing the claim is present. The Contractor shall pay or deny clean paper claims within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt. If the Contractor fails to pay or deny a clean claim within these timeframes and subsequently reimburses for any services itemized within the claim, the Contractor shall also pay the provider interest at the rate set forth in IC 12- 15-21-3(7)(A). The Contractor shall pay interest on all clean claims paid late (i.e., in- or out -of-network claims) and payments made inaccurately (paid upon the claim once adjudicated appropri ately) for which the Contractor is responsible, unless the Contractor and provider have made alternate written payment arrangements. Unclean claims must be rejected or denied within thirty (30) days of receipt. The out -of-network provider filing limit for submission of claims to the Contractor is six (6) months from the date of service. This conforms with the filing limit under the Medicaid State P lan (42 CFR 447.45(d)(4)). The in- network provider filing limit is established in the Contractor's pr ovider agreements pursuant to the guidelines set forth in Section 4.9 , which generally require in- network providers to submit claims within ninety (90) calendar days from the date of service. Timely filing limits are automatically waived in the instances of eligibility updates/ retroactivity, agency error, or any other condition established by FSSA in rule or policy. In addition, in accordance with 42 CFR 447.45(d)(4)(ii), if a claim for payment under Medicare has been filed in a timely manner, the Contract or may pay a claim relating to the same services within six ( 6) months after the provider receives notice of the disposition of the Medicare claim. The Contractor's IT systems must allow for the bypassing of timely filing limits or indication of alleged waiver for these established conditions that does not solely rely on the appeals or grievance processes outlined in this Contract. 240 The Contractor shall meet the requirements set forth in IC 27- 13-36.2- 3 and notify providers of deficiencies in claims within the set timelines in State statute. All providers must be offered on their provider agreement the option to select Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) for provider payments. The Contractor shall develop a plan to issue payments predominantly via EFT and submit to the State for approval. The Contractor shall pay claims via EFT and check runs at least weekly.

Data Accuracy, d. Adherence to FSSA established code sets and standards Policy, e. Provider Qualifications, f. Member Eligibility and Enrollment, and g. Over -Utilization Standards. Disclosure of information contained in the Medicaid National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) files shall be limited to only those responsible for the implementation of the quarterly State Medicaid NCCI edit files. Disclosure shall not be made prior to the start of the new calendar quarter. 241 After the start of the new calendar quarter, the Contractor may disclose only non- confidential information contained in the Medicaid NCCI edit files that is also available to the general public found on the Medicaid NCCI webpage. The Contractor agrees to use any non- public information from the quarterly State Medicaid NCCI edit files only for any business purposes directly related to the implementation of the Medicaid NCCI methodologies in the Indi ana. New, revised, or deleted Medicaid NCCI edits shall not be published or otherwise shared by the Contractor with individuals, medical societies, or any other entities unless they were a Contracted Party prior to the posting of the Medicaid NCCI edits on the Medicaid NCCI webpage. Implementation of new, revised, or deleted Medicaid NCCI edits shall not occur prior to the first day of the calendar quarter. Only FSSA has the discretion to release additional information for selected individual edits or limited ranges of edits from the NCCI files shared with the Contractor. FSSA will impose penalties, up to and including loss of Contract, for violations of this confidentiality agreement relating to use of the Medicaid NCCI files. 9.7.6 Remittance Advice Requirements The Contractor must produce a remittance advice related to the Contractor's payments and/or denials to providers and each must include at a minimum: a. Appropriate explanatory remarks related to a payment or reason(s) for den ials and adjustments, b. A detailed explanation/description of all denials, payments and adjustments, c.

Electronic remittance advices must either direct providers to the link where this information is explained or include a supplemental file where this information is explained. The related remittance advice must be sent with the payment, unless the payment is made by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Any remittance advice related to an EFT must be sent to the provider, no later than the date of the EFT. The remittance advice shall contain appropriate explanatory remarks related to payment or denial of the claim, including but not limited to TPL data. If a claim is partially or totally denied on the basis the provider did not submit any required information or documentation with the claim, then the remittance advice shall specifically identify all such information and documentation. In accordance with 42 CFR 455.18 and 455.19, the following statement shall be included on each remittance advice sent to providers: ''I understand that payment and satisfaction of this claim will be from federal and state funds, and that any false claims, statements, documents, or concealment of a material fact, may be prosecuted under applicable federal and/or state laws. 242 9.7.7 Claims System Audits The Contractor shall develop and implement an internal claims audit function that will include at a minimum, the following: 1. Verification that provider contracts are loaded correctly, and 2. Accuracy of payments against provider contract terms. Audits of provider contract terms must be performed on a regular and periodic basis and consist of a random, statistically significant sampling of all contracts in effect at the time of the audit. The audit sampling methodology must be documented in policy and the Contractor shall review the Contract loading of both large groups and individual practitioners at least once every three (3) -year period in addition to any time a Contract change is initiated during that timeframe. The findings of the audits specified above must be documented and any deficiencies noted in the resulting reports must be met with corrective action. In addition, in the event of a system change or upgrade, the Contractor shall also be required to initiate an independent audit of the Claim Payment/Health Information System. FSSA will approve the scope of this audit and may include areas such as a verification of eligibility and enrollment information loading, Contract information management (contract loading and auditing), claims processing and encounter submission processes, and will require a copy of the final audit findings. FSSA shall have the right to perform a random sample audit of all claims and expects the Contractor to fully comply with the requirements of the audit, and provide all requested documentation, including provider claims and encounters submissions. 9.7.8 Recoupments The Contractor's claims processes, as well as its prior authorization and concurrent review process, must minimize the likelihood of having to recoup already -paid claims. Any individual recoupment in excess of fifty thousand dollars ( $50,000) per provider or Tax Identificati on Number within a Contract Year or greater than twelve ( 12) months after the date of the original payment must be approved by FSSA. The Contractor must void encounters for claims that are recouped in full. For recoupments that result in a reduced claim value or adjustments that result in an increased claim value, replacement encounters must be submitted. All replaced or voided encounters must reach adjudicated status within one hundred and twenty ( 120) days of the approval of the recoupment. In accordance with IC 27-8- 5.7-10 the Contractor may not recoup a claim (i.e. request a provider refund or adjust subsequent claims) more than two (2) years after the date of an overpayment, except in cases of fraud. 9.7.9 Claims System Changes The Contractor shall ensure that changing or making major upgrades to the information systems affecting claims processing, payment or any other major business component, is accompanied by a plan which includes a timeline, milestones, and outlines adequate testing to be completed before implementation. The Contractor shall notify and provide the system change plan to FSSA for review and comment at least ninety (90) calendar days of the projected date of the change. 243 9.7.10 C laims Reports The Contractor shall submit claims processing and adjudication data as prescribed by the Reporting Manual. The Contractor shall also identify specific cases and trends to prevent and respond to any potential problems relating to timely and appropriate claims processing. 9.8 Encounter Data Submission The Contractor shall have policies, procedures and mechanisms in place to support the encounter data reporting process described below and in the State fiscal agent's Companion Guides. The Contractor shall strictly adhere to requirements established by the State and to the standards set forth in the State fiscal agent's Companion Guides, as may be amended from time to time, such as the file structure and content definitions (including any content definitions as may further be interpreted or defined by FSSA) . The quality of Contractor's encounter data submissions shall be subject to audit and validation. The Contractor shall fully comply with all such audit and validation activities including, but not limited to, attending meetings, providing background information on encounter data submissions, providing access to systems, records, and personnel that can assist auditors with their work, and timely responding to all information requests from the State or its auditors. The Contractor technical meetings with FSSA and the Fiscal Agent provides a forum for Contractor technical support staff to participate in the development of the data exchange process and ask questions related to data exchange issues, including encounter data transmission and reporting issues. The Contractor shall report any problems it is experiencing with encounter data submissions and reporting at this monthly meeting and to its designated FSSA Policy Analyst. 9.8.1 Definition and Uses of Encounter Data The Contractor shall submit an encounter claim to the State fiscal agent or its designee for every service rendered to a member for which the Contractor either paid or denied reimbursement. Encounter data provides reports of individual patient encounters with the Contractor's health car e network. These claims contain fee- for-service equivalent detail as to procedures, diagnoses, place of service, units of service, billed amounts and rendering providers' identification numbers and other detailed claims data required for quality improvement monitoring and utilization analysis. The Contractor shall ensure that submitted encounter claims reflect the final adjudication of payment made from the Contractor to the provider. After the initial payment, if changes in provider payment or third- party contributions change the amount paid by the Contractor, the Contractor shall submit an adjustment to the encounter claim displaying the final payment made by the Contractor to the provider, along with any updated data fields relevant to the final provider payment. This includes payments that were changed based on post -payment audit, even if the provider did not resubmit the claim to the Contractor with the updated data fields. For example, if a post -payment audit finds that a different DRG/SOI or billed amo unt should be used to calculate the payment, those fields should be resubmitted on the adjusted encounter. The State will use the encounter data to make tactical and strategic decisions related to the [ MLTSS Program Name] program and to the Contract. For the purposes of this section \"paid amount\" is defined as the amount paid to the Provider excluding Third Party Liability, Provider withhold and Provider incentives, and Medical Assistance cost-sharing. For the purposes of this section \"allowed amount\" is defined as the Provider contracted rate prior to any exclusions or add- ons. The State shall primarily use the encounter data to make tactical and strategic decisions related to the [MLTSS Program Name] program and to the Contract. The State shall primarily use encounter data to calculate the Contractor's future capitation rates, with alternative data sources utilized as appropriate to meet actuarial and federal standards. Encounter data will also be used to calculate incentive payments to the Contractor, monitor quality and to assess the Contractor's 244 Contract compliance. See Exhibit 2 for a schedule of liquidated damages that FSSA will assess for non- compliance with encounter data submission requirements. 9.8.2 Reporting Format and Batch Submission Schedule The Contractor shall submit all encounter claims in an electronic format that adheres to the data specifications in the Companion Guides and any other state or federally mandated electronic claims submission standards or be subject to liquidated damages. As applicable, all required data fields must be included on all encounter claims, including RUG score for nursing facility claims, Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) and Severity of Illness (SOI) for inpatient claims, revenue codes for outpatient claims, procedure codes, diagnosis codes, National Drug Codes (NDCs), units of service, place of service, dates of service, paid dates, billing and rendering provider IDs, billed, allowed, and paid amounts, patient liability (for nursing home claims), copayments/coinsurance/deductible amounts (for both Medicare and commercial coordination of benefits), the claim filing indicator code, and all other fields that may be relevant to payment or patient acuity. The Contractor's encounter claims must include the National Drug Codes (NDCs) when an encounter involves products or services with NDCs, including medical and institutional claims where medications with NDCs are included and billed separately. An indication of claim payment status and an identification of claim transaction type (i.e., original, void/cancel or replacement) is also required, in the form designated by FSSA. If the Contractor uses a Subcontractor to administer a benefit, for example a dental administrator or Pharmacy Benefit Manager, the \"paid amount\" is defined as the amount paid to the Provider excluding Third Party Liability, Provider withhold and Provider incentives, and Medical Assistance cost-sharing by the Subcontractor. The Contractor must adhere to rep aid amounts for services rendered under sub capitated risk-based arrangements must be estimated using usual and customary payment or for state directed payments the FFS fee schedule and must not include administrative costs or other incentives. See 42 CFR 438.230 on accounting for subcontractor payments to providers. The Contractor shall submit Home and Community -Based Services encounter data pursuant to the X12 837P national standard. This includes type of service, units of service, and dates of service, sufficient to provide CMS with the required audit trail. The Contractor shall submit individual -enrollee specific, claim- level data on all post -payment recoveries for all claims on a quarterly basis, in a format determined by the S tate. This is in addition to the corrected encounter submitted by the Contractor. The Contractor shall not submit encounters for administrative care coordination. The Contractor shall submit via secure FTP a complete batch of encounter data for all adjudicated claims for paid and denied claims and any claims not previously submitted before 5 p.m. Eastern on Wednesday each week, or other date and time as specified by the State. FSSA will use an overall average of calendar month submissions to assess compliance with this encounter claim submission requirement. The State shall require the Contractor to submit a corrective action plan and shall assess liquidated damages for failure to comply with the encounter claims submission requirements. See Exhibit 2 for a schedule of liquidated damages FSSA shall assess for non- compliance with this requirement. Only data and information accepted by the data warehouse within six (6) months of the end of the base data year shall be considered for the next year's capitation rate adjustments. 9.8.3 Encounter Claims Quality The Contractor shall have written policies and procedures to address its submission of encounter claims to the State. These policies shall address the submission of encounter data from any sub capitated providers or subcontractors. At least annually, or on a schedule determined at the 245 discretion of the State, the Contractor shall submit an encounter claims work plan that addresses the Contractor's strategy for monitoring and improving encounter claims submission. The Contractor shall comply with the following requirements: a. Timeliness of Contractor's Encounter Claims Submission: The Contractor shall submit ninety eight percent (98%) of adjudicated claims within fourteen (14) calendar days of adjudication. The Contractor shall submit all encounter claims within fifteen (15) months of the earliest date of service on the claim. The Contractor shall submit claim adjustments - both void/replacement claims - within two (2) years from the date of service. b. Compliance with Pre- cycle Edits: The State or its designee will assess each encounter claim for compliance with pre- cycle edits. The Contractor must correct and resubmit any encounter claims that do not pass the pre -cycle edits. c. Accuracy of Encounter Claims Detail : The Contractor shall demonstrate that it implements policies and procedures to ensure that encounter claims submissions are accurate; that is, that all encounter claims detail being submitted accurately represents the services provided and that the claims are accurately adjudicated according to the Contractor's internal standards and all state and federal requirements. FSSA shall have the right to monitor Contractor encounter claims for accuracy against the Contractor's internal criteria and its level of adjudication accuracy. FSSA shall regularly monitor the Contractor's accuracy by reviewing the Contractor's compliance with its internal policies and procedures for ensuring accurate encounter claims submissions and by performing a random sample audit of all claims. FSSA expects the Contractor to fully comply with the requirements of t he review and audit and to provide all requested documentation, including provider and encounter claims submissions and medical records. FSSA shall require the Contractor to submit a corrective action plan and will require non- compliance remedies for the Contractor's failure to comply with encounter claims accuracy reporting standards. d. Completeness of Encounter Claims Data: The Contractor shall have in place a system for monitoring and reporting the completeness of claims and encounter data received from providers, i.e., for every service provided, providers shall submit a corresponding claim or encounter data with claim detail identical to that required for fee-for-service claims submissions, including National Drug Codes as applicable. The Contractor shall also have in place a system for verifying and ensuring that providers are not submitting claims or encounter data for services that were not provided. The Contractor shall adhere to CMS encounter submission requirements under 42 CFR 438.242. Encounters shall include allowed amounts and paid amounts. Subcontractor administrative costs must be excluded from paid amounts. Enhanced services paid by the Contractor shall not be submitted to the state as an encounter claim. As part of its annual encounter claims work plan, the Contractor shall demonstrate its internal standards for measuring completeness, the results of any completeness studies, and any corrective action plans developed to address areas of non- compliance. FSSA may require the Contractor to demonstrate, through report or audit, that this monitoring system is in place and that the Contractor is regularly monitoring the completeness of claims and encounter data and ensuring that the Contractor is meeting FSSA's completeness requirements. FSSA sha ll require the Contractor to submit a corrective action plan and will require non- compliance remedies for the Contractor's failure to comply with encounter claims completeness reporting standards, as identified in the Encounter Data Quality Validation template. 246 9.9 Coordination of Benefits and Third Party Liability (TPL) Prior to payment of claims for covered services for members under this contract, the Contractor shall ensure service providers complete the pursuit and collection of monies from third party payers. Program funding shall be used as a source of payment for covered services only after all other sources of payment have been exhausted and shall be the payor of last resort unless specifically prohibited by applicable State or Federal law. Pursuit of collections will include third party liability insurers and casualty collections such as private health insurance, Medicare, employer sponsored health insurance, settlements from a liability insurer, workers' compensation, long- term care insurance, and other State and Federal programs. If determined that a potentially liable third party exists, the Contractor must ensure that the provider bills the third party first before sending the claim to the MCE. If the Contractor has paid claims and subsequently discovers the existence of a liable third party it must attempt to recover the money from the liable third party. The Contractor shall share information regarding its members with other payers as specified by FSSA and in accordance with 42 CFR 438.208(b), which relates to coordination of care. In the process of coordinati ng care, the Contractor must protect each member's privacy in accordance with the confidentiality requirements stated in 45 CFR 160 and 164. The Contractor shall be responsible for payment of the member's coinsurance, deductibles, co- payments and other cos t-sharing expenses required under third party coverage, but the Contractor's total liability shall not exceed what the Contractor would have paid in the absence of TPL, after subtracting the amount paid by the primary payer. A remittance advice shall be created for the provider even if the Contractor liability is zero dollars. The Contractor shall coordinate benefits and payments with the other insurer for services authorized by the Contractor but provided outside the Contractor's plan. Such authorization may occur prior to provision of service, but any authorization requirements imposed on the member or provider of service by the Contractor shall not prevent or unduly delay a member from receiving medically necessary services. The Contractor remains responsible for the costs incurred by the member with respect to care and services which are included in the Contractor's capitation rate, but which are not covered or payable under the other insurer's plan. The Contractor must have a signed Coordination of Benefits Agreement (COBA) with CMS and participate in the automated crossover claim process administered by Medicare. In accordance with IC 12- 15-8 and 405 IAC 1-1- 15, FSSA has a lien upon any money payable by any third party who is or may be liable for the medical expenses of a Medicaid recipient when Medicaid provides medical assistance. The Contractor may exercise any independent subrogation rights it may have under Indiana law in pursuit or collection of payments it has made when a legal cause of action for damages is instituted by the member or on behalf of the member. 9.9.1 Collection and Reporting The Contractor will be responsible for identifying, collecting and reporting third party liability coverage and collection information to the State. As third- party liability information is a component of capitation rate development, the Contractor shall maintain records regarding third party liability collections and report these collections to OMPP in a manner prescribed by the Reporting Manual. The Contractor will retain all TPL collections from any insurer or responsible party made on behalf of its members. 9.9.2 Cost Avoidance The Contractor's TPL responsibilities include cost avoidance. When the Contractor is aware of other insurance coverage prior to paying for a health care service for a member, it should avoid payment by rejecting a provider's claim and direct that the provider first submits the claim to the appropriate third party. 247 When the Contractor has identified members who have health insurance, the Contractor shall validate the insurance prior to using that data for cost avoidance. If insurance coverage information is not available, or if one of the exceptions to the cost avoidance rule discussed in this section applies, then the Contractor shall make the payment and make a claim against the third party, if it is determined that the third party is or may be liable. The Contractor shall ensure that its cost avoidance efforts do not prevent a member from receiving medically necessary services in a timely manner. 9.9.3 Retroactive Medicare Coverage Program members may become retroactively Medicare eligible. When this occurs, the Contractor shall recover medical expenses payable by Medicare for the months of retroactive Medicare eligibility. The State will recoup the capitation rate paid for months with retroactive Medicare eligibility and pay a reduced dual- eligible capitation rate, as applicable. 9.9.4 Cost Avoidance Exceptions In accordance with 42 CFR 433.139(c), if the probable existence of third party liability cannot be established or third party benefits are not available to pay the member's medical expenses at the time the claim is filed, the Contractor must first pay the provider and then pursue reimbursement from the potentially liable third party within sixty ( 60) days after the end of the month in which payment is made. Retroactive Recoveries Involving Commercial Insurance Payor Source: For a period of two years from the date of service, the Contractor shall engage in retroactive third party recovery efforts for claims paid to determine if there are commercial insurance payor sources that were not known at the time of payment. In the event a commercial insurance payor source is identified, the Contractor shall seek recovery from the commercial insurance. The Contractor is prohibited from recouping related payments from providers, requiring providers to take action, or requiring the involvement of providers in any way, unless the provider was paid in full from both the Contractor and the commercial insurance. Encounters shall be adjusted as a result of retroactive recoveries. 9.9.5 TPL Special Circumstances Timely Filing: The Contractor shall not deny a claim for timeliness if the untimely claim submission results from a provider's efforts to determine the extent of a third party liability. The Contractor shall waive timely filing in cases where a retroactive coverage change or error has resulted in another MCE, Insurer, or Fee for Service recouping or recovering a claim. The Contractor shall permit the provider to submit a claim for payment within ninety ( 90) days of claim's recovery or recoupment notice from the previous payer. Medicare regulations 42 C.F.R. \u00a7424.44(b) allows for exceptions to the one ( 1) calendar year time limit for filing Medicare claims. Retroactive Medicare entitlement involving State Medicaid Agencies, where a State Medicaid Agency recoups payment from a provider or supplier six ( 6) months or more after the date the service was furnished to a dually eligible beneficiary, is an allowed exemption. Refer to Chapter 1, subsection 70.7 of the Medicare Claims Processing manual for qualifying exceptions and associated billing instructions. OMPP will be responsible for estate recovery activities. 9.10 Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) Requirements The Contractor shall work with FSSA, its fiscal agent, and FSSA's electronic visit verification (EVV) partner to implement an EVV solution which meets the requirements under section 12006 (a) of the 21st 248 Century Cures Act. The Contractor must utilize the State Sponsored- EVV Solution's aggregator of EVV records when verifying the presence of EVV records for all impacted personal care and home health services during claims adjudication. The Contractor may only utilize EVV for claims payments on services deter mined by FSSA to require EVV and only enforce claims denials for missing or inaccurate EVV records based upon the timeframe established by FSSA. 10.0 Performance Reporting and Incentives FSSA places great emphasis on the delivery of quality health care to members. Performance monitoring and data analysis are critical components in assessing how well the Contractor is maintaining and improving the quality of care delivered in [MLTSS Program Name]. The State will require and use various deliverables, performance targets, industry standards, national benchmarks and program- specific standards in monitoring the Contractor's performance and Outcomes, for both the Contractor's Medicaid and their Dual Eligible Special Needs Program (DSNP). During the term of the contract, the State intends to publish key performance metrics that may include but not be limited to, claims performance, prior authorization data, quality performance metrics, network adequacy and/or utilization reports. Public reporting will allow FSSA to compare and monitor plan performance as well as provide members, providers and stakeholders information to compare health plan performance. In an effort to monitor health plan performance and member, informal caregiver, and provider satisfaction, FSSA reserves the right to conduct and publicly share survey results and other data elements collected for analysis during the term of the contract. Additionally, beginning in year two (2) of the Contract, the State may utilize performance outcomes as a factor for auto- assignments and enrollment materials developed to facilitate member choice of an MCE. The Contractor must comply with all reporting requirements and must submit the requested data. The State reserves the right to require the Contractor to work with and submit data to third- party data warehouses or analytic vendors. The Contractor must have policies, procedures and mechanisms in place to ensure that the financial and non-financial performance data submitted to FSSA is accurate. In accordance with 42 CFR 438.604 and 42 CFR 438.606 all data must be certified by the Contractor's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer or an individual who has delegated authority to sign for, and who reports directly to one of these employees. The certification must attest, based on best knowledge, information and belief to the accuracy, completeness and truthfulness of the data and documents submitted to the State. This certification must be submitted concurrently with the certified data. For reference, the current Reporting Manual is provided in the Bidders' Library. FSSA reserves the right to audit the Contractor's self -reported data and change reporting requirements at any time with reasonable notice. FSSA may require corrective action as outlined in Contract Exhibit 2 Contract Compliance and Pay for Outcomes for Contractor non- compliance with these and other subsequent reporting requirements and performance standards. FSSA may change the frequency of reports and may require additional reports at any time. In these situations, FSSA shall provide at least thirty (30) calendar days' notice to the Contractor before changing reporting requirements. FSSA may request ad hoc reports at any time. The Reporting Manual will detail reporting requirements and the full list of required reports and reporting methods. The Contractor shall comply with all State instructions regarding submission requirements, including but not limited to, formatting, timeliness and data uploading instructions. FSSA may schedule meetings or conference calls with the Contractor upon receiving the performance data. When FSSA identifies potential performance issues, the Contractor must formally respond in writing to these issues within five (5) business days of the receipt of the feedback meeting or conference call. If the Contractor fails to provide a formal, written response to the feedback or fails to respond within five (5) 249 business days, FSSA may consider the vendor(s) noncompliant in its performance reporting and may implement corrective actions. 10.1 Financial Reports Financial Reports assist FSSA in monitoring the Contractor's financial trends to assess its stability and continued ability to offer health care services to its members. If the Contractor does not meet the financial reporting requirements, FSSA will notify the Contractor of the noncompliance and designate a period of time, not less than ten (10) calendar days, during which the Contractor must provide a written response to the notification. Contractors must meet IDOI licensure and financial requirements. Examples of Financial Reports to be submitted by the Contractor, in accordance with the terms of the Reporting Manual, include but are not limited t o: o IDOI Filing; o Physician Incentive Plan Disclosure; o Encounter Data Quality Validation template; o Insurance Premium Notice; o Capitation Reconciliation Report; o Vendor Contact Sheet; and o Key Staff and Other Staffing On an annual basis, the Contractor must submit program specific audited financial reports, separate for each managed care program (i.e., HIP, Hoosier Healthwise, Hoosier Care Connect, and [MLTSS Program N ame] as applicable). The audit must be conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounti ng principles and generally accepted auditing standards. Audits should be performed for calendar years using data on a services incurred basis with six (6) months of claims run- out. The audit must detail the medical expense payments reported net of subcontracted administrative expenses and categorize all quality improvement spending into the allowed five categories. The audit shall review if quality improvement spending passes the requirements under 45 CFR 158.150b. Audits should be performed for calendar years using data on a services -incurred basis with six months of claims run- out. 10.2 Member Service Reports Member Service Reports identify the methods the Contractor uses to communicate to members about preventive health care and program services and monitor member satisfaction. FSSA reserves the right to require more frequent Member Service reporting at the beginning of the Contract and as necessary to ensure satisfactory levels of member service. 10.3 Network Development Reports Network Development Reports assist FSSA in monitoring the Contractor's network composition by specialty and geo- access ratios in order to assess member access and network capacity. The Contractor shall identify current enrollment, gaps in network services and the corrective actions that the Contractor is taking to resolve any potential problems relating to network access and capacity. FSSA will require more frequent Network Geographic Access Assessment reporting at the beginning of the Contract and during implementation of program changes as necessary to ensure satisfactory network access, until the Contractor demonstrates that the network access standards have been met. 10.4 Provider Service Reports Provider Service Reports assist FSSA in monitoring the methods the Contractor uses to communicate to providers about clinical, technical and quality management and improvement issues relating to the 250 program. FSSA reserves the right to require more frequent provider service reporting at the beginning of the contract to ensure satisfactory levels of provider service. 10.5 Quality Management Reports Quality Management Reports document the methods and processes the Contractor uses to identify program and clinical improvements that enhance the appropriate access, level of care, quality and utilization of program services by its members and providers. These reports assist FSSA in monitoring the Contractor's quality management and improvement activities. 10.6 Utilization and Authorization Reports Utilization Reports assist FSSA in monitoring the Contractor's utilization trends, performance and progress towards performance targets. The Contractor will monitor utilization by subpopulation when appropriate and as directed by FSSA. The State reserves the right to require the Contractor to submit regular prior authorization detail information on ev ery prior authorization request received and processed in an electronic State specified format. 10.7 Claims Reports These reports assist FSSA in monitoring the Contractor's claims processing activities to ensure appropriate member access to services and payments to providers. The Contractor shall submit claims processing and adjudication data. The Contractor shall also identify specific cases and trends to prevent and respond to any potential problems relating to timely and appropriate claims processing. 10.8 Care Coordination and Service Coordination Reporting Care Coordination and Service Coordination Reports are necessary to monitor the critical collaborative process which assesses, plans, implements, coordinates, monitors, and evaluates options and services to meet members' individual health needs through communication and available resources to promote quality and cost -effective outcomes. Care Coordination and Service Coordination reports will include metrics and performance data on Service Plan Timeline Requirements referenced in Section 4.10.5. 10.9 Health Outcomes and Clinical Reporting Health Outcomes and Clinical Reports assist FSSA in monitoring the health status of [ MLTSS Program Name] enrollees and to identify the effectiveness of Contractor interventions. 10.10 CMS Reporting The Contractor shall be required to submit data requested by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), including but not limited to all required MCE reporting obligations described in the CMS Special Terms and Conditions (STCs) for the State's waiver. For example, in addition to the specific reports described in the STCs, CMS often requests additional data and reports in advance of FSSA's monthly conference calls with CMS. In preparation for these calls, FSSA will require the Contractor to submit the data requested by CMS. The Contractor shall submit this data in the timeframe specified by FSSA. 10.11 Other Reporting OMPP shall have the right to require additional reports to address program- related issues that are not anticipated at the Contract start date but are determined by FSSA to be necessary for program monitoring. 251 11.0 Failure to Perform/Non -compliance Remedies 11.1 Non-compliance Remedies It is the State's primary goal to ensure the Contractor is delivering quality care to members. To meet this goal, the State monitors quality and performance standards and holds the Contractor accountable for complying with Contract terms at all times. FSSA will work collaboratively with the Contractor to maintain and improve programs, and not to impair health plan stability. In the event the Contractor fails to meet performance requirements or reporting standards set forth in this Scope of Work, Exhibit 2, or the Contractor Reporting Manual, the State will provide the Contractor with a written notice of non- compliance and may require any of the corrective actions or remedies set forth in Exhibit 2. The State will provide written notice of non- compliance to the Contractor within sixty (60) calendar days of the State's discovery of such non- compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any failure or delay on the part of the State in providing written notice or otherwise exercising any right, power or remedy under the Contract will not operate as a waiver of such right, power or remedy, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power, or remedy will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or remedy. Except as specifically set forth herein, the rights and remedies available pursuant to this Contract are cumulative in nature and not alternative. For example, if FSSA elects not to exercise a corrective action clause contained anywhere in the Contract in a particular instance, this decision must not be construed as a waiver of the State's right to pursue future assessment of that performance requirement and associated damages, including damages that, under the terms of the Contract, may be retroactively assessed. 11.2 Evidence o f Financial Responsibility The State reserves the right to require a performance bond of standard commercial scope issued by a surety company registered with the IDOI or other evidence of financial responsibility to guarantee performance by the Contractor of its obligations under the Contract. The State reserves the righ t to implement financial responsibility requirements if enrollment levels indicate the need to do so. If these requirements are implemented and default by the Contractor occurs, the State shall, in addition to any other remedies it may have under the Contract, obtain payment under the performance bond or other arrangement for the purposes of the following: 1. Reimbursing the State for any expenses incurred by reason of a breach of the Contractor's obligations under the Contract, including, but not limited to, expenses incurred after termination of the Contract for reasons other than the convenience of the State. 2. Reimbursing the State for costs incurred in procuring replacement services. 12.0 Termination Provisions 12.1 Contract Terminations FSSA reserves the right to terminate this Contract in whole or in part, and transition members to a different Contractor, due to the failure of the Contractor to comply with any term or condition of the Contract, or failure to take corrective action as required by FSSA to comply with the terms of the Contract. The Contract between the State and the Contractor may be terminated as follows: 1. By mutual written agreement of the State and Contractor; 2. By the Contractor, subject to the remedies listed in the Contract; 252 3. By the State, in whole or in part, whenever the State determines that the Contractor has failed to satisfactorily perform its contracted duties and responsibilities including, but not limited to, circumstances which present risk to member health or safety, and as authorized by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and 42 CFR 438.70 or has failed to meet the applicable requirements of sections 42 CFR 438.708(a), 42 CFR 438.708(b), sections 1903(m), 1905(t), and 1932 of the Social Security Act and is unable to cure such failure within thirty (30) calendar days after receipt of a notice specifying those conditions; 4. By the State, in whole or in part, whenever, for any reason, the State determines that such termination is in the best interest of the State, with at least thirty (30) calendar days' prior notice to the Contractor. Such termination is referred to herein as \"Termination for Convenience;\" 5. By the State, in whole or in part, whenever funding from state, federal or other sources are withdrawn, reduced or limited, with sufficient prior notice to the Contractor; or 6. By the State, in whole or in part, whenever the State determines that the instability of the Contractor's financial condition threatens delivery of services and continued performance of Contractor responsibilities. The State will provide the Contractor with a pre- termination hearing prior to contract termination in accordance with 42 CFR 438.710(b). 12.1.1 Termination by the State for Contractor Default The State may terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, whenever the State determines that the Contractor or a subcontractor has failed to satisfactorily perform its contracted duties and responsibilities and is unable or unwilling to cure such failure within thirty (30) calendar days, or such other reasonable period of time as specified in writing by the State, taking into consideration the gravity and nature of the default. Such termination is referred to herein as \"Termination for Default.\" Upon determination by the State that the Contractor has failed to satisfactorily perform its contracted duties and responsibilities, the Contractor must be notified in writing, by either certified or registered mail, of the failure and of the time period which has been established to cure suc h failure. If the Contractor is unable or unwilling to cure the failure within the specified time period, the State may notify the Contractor that the Contract, in full or in part, has been terminated for default. If, after providing notice of Termination for Default, it is determined by either the State or by a court of law that the Contractor was not in default or that the Contractor's failure to perform or make progress in performance was due to causes beyond the control of, and without error or neglig ence on the part of, the Contractor or any of its subcontractors, the notice of termination will not be considered a Termination for Default, but must be deemed to have been issued as a Termination for Convenience, and the rights and obligations of the parties must be governed accordingly. In the event of Termination for Default, in full or in part, as provided under this clause, the State may procure, upon such terms and in such manner as is deemed appropriate by the State, supplies or services similar to those terminated, and the Contractor shall be liable for any costs for such similar supplies and services and all other damages allowed by law. In addition, the Contractor shall be liable to the State for costs incurred to procure such similar supplies or services as are needed to continue operations. In the event of a Termination for Default prior to the start of operations, any claim the Contractor may assert must be governed by the procedures defined in the Contract. In the event of a Termination for Default during ongoing operations, the Contractor will be paid for any outstanding capitation payments due, less any assessed damages. The rights and remedies of the State 253 provided in this Section are not exclusive and are in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law or under the Contract. 12.1.2 Termination for Financial Instability The State may terminate the Contract upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 1. The Contractor becomes financially unstable to the point of threatening the ability of the State to obtain the services provided for under the Contract; 2. The Contractor ceases to conduct business in normal course; 3. The Contractor makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or 4. The Contractor suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its business or assets. The State may, at its option, immediately terminate the Contract effective at the close of business on the date specified. In the event the State elects to terminate the Contract under this provision, the Contractor must be notified in writing, by either certified or registered mail, specifying the date of termination. In the event of the filing of a petition in bankruptcy by or against a principal subcontractor, the Contractor must immediately inform the Contract Administrator as specified in the Contract between the State and the Contractor. The Contractor must ensure that all tasks related to the subcontract are performed in accordance with the terms of the Contract. 12.1.3 Termination for Failure to Disclose Records The State may terminate the Contract, in whole or in part, whenever the State determines that the Contractor has failed to make available to any authorized representative of the State, any administrative, financial or medic al records relating to the delivery of services for which State program dollars have been expended. In the event that the State terminates the Contract pursuant to this provision, the Contractor must be notified in writing, either by certified or registered mail, either sixty (60) calendar days prior to or such other reasonable period of time prior to the effective date, of the basis and extent of the termination. Termination must be effective as of the close of business on the date specified in the notice. 12.1.4 Termination by the Contractor The Contractor must give advance written notice of termination, or intent not to renew, to the State a minimum of one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to termination or expiration. The effective date of the termination must be no earlier than the last day of the month in which the one hundred and eightieth (180th) day falls. Termination of the Contract by the Contractor is subject to damages listed in Section 12 .4. 12.2 Termination Procedures If the Contractor is providing services under more than one contract with Indiana Medicaid, the State may deem unsatisfactory performance under one contract to be cause for requir ing the Contractor to provide assurance of performance under any and all other contracts. In such situations, the State reserves the right to seek remedies under both actual and anticipatory breaches of contract if adequate assurance of performance is not received. When termination is anticipated, FSSA will deliver to the Contractor a Notice of Termination by certified or registered mail specifying the nature of the termination and the date upon which such termination 254 becomes effective. Within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of the Notice of Termination, the Contractor must submit a written plan of termination (\"Transition Plan\") for FSSA's approval. The Transition Plan shall, at minimum, address the following: 1. Stopping work under the Contract on the date and to the extent specified in the Notice of Termination. 2. Notifying all of the Contractor's members regarding the date of termination and the process by which members will continue to receive medical care. FSSA must approve all member notification materials in advance of distribution. 3. Terminating all orders and subcontracts, to the extent that they relate to the performance of work terminated by the Notice of Termination. 4. Assigning activities to the State, its designee or successor contractor, in the manner and to the extent that they relate to the performance of work terminated by the Notice of Termination. 5. Assigning to the State, its designee or successor contractor, in the manner and to the extent directed, all of the rights, titles and interests of the Contractor under the orders or subcontracts so terminated. 6. With the approval of the State, settling outstanding liabilities and all claims arising out of such termination of orders and subcontracts. 7. Within ten (10) business days from the effective date of the termination, transferring title to the State of Indiana (to the extent that title has not already been transferred) and deliver, in the manner and to the extent directed, all data, other information and documentation, in any form that relates to the work terminated by the Notice of Termination. 8. Taking such action as may be necessary, or as the State may direct, for the protection and preservation of the property related to the Contract that is in the possession of the Contractor and in which the State has or may acquire an interest. 9. Providing for all the Contractor's responsibilities set forth in Section 12 .3. The requirements listed above are illustrative only and do not limit or restrict the State's ability to require the Contractor to address additional issues in its Transition Plan. The State shall withhold the Contractor's final capitation payment until the Contractor has (a) received FSSA approval of its Transition Plan, and (b) completed the activities set forth in its Transition Plan, as well as any additional activities requested by FSSA, to the satisfaction of FSSA, in its sole discretion. 12.3 Contractor Responsibilities upon Termination or Expiration of the Contract Termination or expiration of the Contract does not discharge the obligations of the Contractor with respect to services or items furnished prior to termination or expiration of the Contract, including retention of records and verification of overpayments or underpayments. Termination or expiration of the Contract does not discharge the State's payment obligations to the Contractor or the Contractor's payment obligations to its subcontractors and providers. Upon termination or expiration of the Contract, the Contractor must: 1. Assist the State in taking the necessary steps to ensure a smooth transition of members and services. 2. Provide a written Transition Plan for the State's approval, in accordance with Section 1 2.2. In the event of Contract termination, the Transition Plan shall be due within ten (10) calendar days of receivi ng Notice of Termination from the State. In the event of Contract expiration, the Transition Plan shall be due at least one hundred eighty (180) calendar days prior to expiration of the 255 Contract. The Contractor will revise and resubmit the Transition Plan to the State on a regular basis, the frequency of which will be determined by the State. 3. Appoint a transition coordinator and a liaison for post -transition concerns. 4. Provide for sufficient claims payment staff, member services staff, and provider services staff to ensure a successful transition and payment of all outstanding obligations . 5.
