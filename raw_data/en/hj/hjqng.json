FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION 1 INDICATIONS AND USAG E BEXSERO is a vaccine indicated for active immunization to prevent invasive disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. BEXSERO is approved for use in individuals aged 10 through 25 years. Approval of BEXSERO is based on demonstration of immune response, as measured by serum bactericidal activity against three serogroup B strains representative of prevalent st rains in the United States. The effectiveness of BEXSERO against diverse serogroup B strains has not been confirmed. 2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For intramuscular us e only. 2 2.1 Dose and Schedule Administer 2 doses (0.5- mL each) of BEXSERO at least 1 month apart. 2.2 Administration Shake the syringe immediately before use to form a homogeneous suspension. Do not use the vaccine if it cannot be resuspended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whene ver solution and container permit. Do not use if particulate matter or discoloration is found. Administer BEXSERO as a 0.5- mL intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 2.3 Use of BEXSERO with O ther Meningococcal Group B Vaccines Sufficient data are not available on the safety and effectiveness of using BEXSERO and other meningococcal group B vaccines interchangeably to complete the vaccination series. 3 DOS AGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS BEXSERO is a suspension for intramuscular injection in 0.5- mL single -dose prefilled syringes. 4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Hypersensitivity, including severe allergic reaction, to any component of the vaccine, or after a previous dose of BEXSERO [see Description (11)] . 5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Preventing and Managing Allergic Reactions Appropriate observation and medical treatment should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic reaction following the admi nistration of the vaccine . 5.2 Syncope Syncope (fainting) can occur in association with administration of BEXSERO. Ensure proce dures are in place to avoid injury from falling ass ociated with syncope. 5.3 Latex The tip caps of the prefilled syringes contain natural rubber latex which may cause allergic reactions. 5.4 Limitation of Vaccine Effectiveness BEXSERO may not protect all vaccine recipients. BEXSERO may not provide protection against all meningococcal serogroup B strains [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)]. 3 5.5 Altered Immunocompetence Some i ndividuals with altered immunocompetence may have reduced immune responses to BEXSERO. Complement Deficienc y Persons with certain complement deficiencies and persons receiving treatment that inhibits terminal complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis serogroup B even if they develop anti bodies following vaccination with BEXSERO. [S ee Clinical Pharmacology (12.1).] 6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common solicited adverse reactions observed in clinical trials were pa in at the injection site (83%), arthralgia (13%). 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction r ates observed in the clinical trials of a vaccine cannot be directly compared with rates in the clinical trials of another vaccine and may not reflect the rat es observed in practice. In 4 clinical trials, 3 ,058 individuals aged 10 through 25 years received at least one dose of BEXSERO, 1 ,436 participants received only BEXSERO, 2,089 received only placebo or a control vaccine, and 1,622 participants received a m ixed regimen (placebo or control vaccine and BEXSERO). In a randomized controlled study1 conducted in U .S. and Poland, 120 participants aged 10 through 25 years received at least 1 dose of BEXSERO, including 112 participants who received 2 doses of BEXSERO 2 months apart; 97 participants received saline placebo followed by MENVEO [Meningococcal (Groups A, C, Y, and W -135) Oligosaccharide Diphtheria CRM 197 Conjugate Vaccine]. Across groups, median age was 13 years, males comprised 49% , and 60% were white, 34% were Hispanic, 4% were black, <1% were Asian, and 2% were other. In a second randomized controlled study2 conducted in Chile, all subjects (N = 1,622) aged 11 through 17 years received at least 1 dose of BEXSERO. This study included a subset of 810 subje cts who received 2 doses of BEXSERO 1 or 2 months apart. A control group of 128 subjects received at least 1 dose of placebo containing aluminum hydroxide. A subgroup of 128 subjects received 2 doses of BEXSERO 6 months apart. In this study, median age was 14 years, males comprised 44%, and 99% were Hispanic. In a third randomized co ntrolled study 3 conducted in the United Kingdom (U .K.), 974 university students aged 18 through 24 years received at least 1 dose of BEXSERO, including 932 subjects who received 2 doses of BEXSERO 1 month apart. Comparator groups received 1 dose of MENVEO followed by 1 dose of placebo containing aluminum hydroxide ( n = 956) or 2 doses 4 of IXIARO (Japanese Encephalitis Vaccine, Inactivated, Adsorbed) ( n = 947). Across groups, media n age was 20 years, males comprised 46%, and 88% were w hite, 5% were Asian, 2% were black, <1% were Hispanic, and 4% were other. In an uncontrolled study4 conducted in Canada and Australia, 342 participants aged 11 through 17 years received at least 1 dose of BEXSERO, including 338 participants who received 2 doses of BEXSERO 1 month apart. The median age was 13 years, males comprised 55%, and 80% were white, 10% were Asian, 4% were Native American/Alaskan, and 4% were other. Local and systemic reactogenici ty data were solicited from all participants in the studies conducted in Chile, U .S./Poland, Canada/Australia, and in a subset of participants in the U .K. study. Reports of unsolicited adverse events occurring within the first 7 days after each vaccination were collected in all studies. In the U .S./Poland study, reports of unsolicite d adverse events were collected up to 1 month after the second vaccination. Reports of all serious adverse events, medically attended adverse events , and adverse events leading to premature withdrawal were collected throughout the study period for the studies conducted in Chile (12 months), U .K. (12 months), U .S./Poland (8 months), and Canada/Australia (2 months). Solicited Adverse Reactions The reported rates of local and system ic reactions among participants aged 10 through 25 years following each dose of BEXSERO administered 2 months apart or control in the U .S./Polish study1 are presented in Table 1.

Pain and systemic reactions : Mild (transient with no limitation in normal daily activity); Moderate (some limitation in normal daily activity); Severe (unable to perform normal daily activity). b Administered 2 months after Dose 1. Solicited adverse reaction rates were similar among participants aged 11 through 24 years who received BEXSERO in the other 3 clinical studies, 2,3,4 except for severe myalgia which was reported by 3 % to 7% of subjects. Severe pain was reported by 8% of university students in the U.K.3 Non-serious Adverse Reactions In the 3 controlled studies1,2,3 (BEXSERO n = 2,221, control n = 2,204), non- serious unsolicited adverse events that occurred within 7 days of any dose were reported by 439 (20%) participants receiving BEXSERO and 197 (9%) control recipients. Unsolicited adverse reactions that were reported among at least 2% of parti cipants and were more frequently reported in participants receiving BEXSERO than in control recipients were injection site pain, headache, i njection site induration unresolved within 7 days, and nasopharyngitis. Serious Adverse Events Overall, in clinical studies, among 3,058 participants aged 10 through 25 years who received at least 1 dose of BEXSERO, 66 (2.1%) participants reported serious adverse events at any time during the study. In the 3 controlled studies 1,2,3 (BEXSERO n = 2,716, c ontrol n = 2,078) , serious adverse events within 30 days after any dose were reported in 23 (0.8%) participants receiving BEXSERO and 10 (0.5%) control recipients. 6.2 Additional Pre -licensure Safety Experience In response to outbreaks of serogroup B meningococcal disease at 2 universities in the U .S., BEXSERO was administered as a 2 -dose series at least 1 month apart. Information on serious adverse events was collected for a period of 30 days aft er each dose from 15,351 individuals aged 16 through 65 years who received at least 1 dose. Overall , 50 individuals (0.3%) reported serious adverse events, including one reaction considered related to vaccination, a case of anaphylaxis within 30 minutes following vaccination. 6.3 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approva l use of BEXSERO. Because these reactions are reported vo luntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not 7 always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to the vaccine. Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders Lymphadenopathy. General D isorders and Administration S ite Conditions Injection site reactions (including extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb, blisters at or around the injection site , and injection site nodule which may persist for more than 1 month) . Immune System Disorders Allergic reactions (including a naphylactic reactions), rash, eye swelling. Nervous System Disorders Syncope, vasovagal responses to injection. 7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Sufficient data are not available to establish the safety and immunogenicity of concomitant administration of BEXSERO with recommended adolescent vaccines. 8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary All pregnancies have a risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinica lly recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. There are no adequate and well -controlled s tudies of BEXSERO in pregnant women in the U.S. Available human data on BEXSERO administered to pregnant women are insufficient to inform vaccin e-associated risks in pregnancy. A developmental toxicity study was performed in female rabbits administered BEX SERO prior to mating and during gestation. The dose was 0.5 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL ). This study revealed no adverse effects on fetal or pre -weaning development due to BEXSERO (see Data) . Data Animal Data: In a developmental toxicity study, female rabbits were administered BEXSERO by intramuscular injection on Days 29, 15, and 1 prior to mating and on G estation Days 7 and 20. The total dose was 0.5 mL at each occasion (a single human dose is 0.5 mL). No adverse e ffects on pre -weaning development up to P ostnatal Day 29 were observed. There were no fetal malformations or variations observed. 8 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known wheth er the vaccine components of BEXSERO are excreted in human milk. Available data are not sufficient to assess the effects of BEXSERO on the breastfed infant or on milk production/excretion . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the m other's clinical need for BEXSERO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from BEXSERO or from the underlying maternal c ondition. For preventive vaccines, the underlying maternal condition is susceptibility to dise ase prevented by the vaccine. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BEXSERO have not been established in children younger than 10 years. 8.5 Geriatric Use Safety and effectiveness of BEXSERO have not been established in adults older than 65 years. 11 DES CRIPTION BEXSERO (Meningococcal Group B Vaccine) is a sterile, white, opalescent, suspension for intramuscular injection. Each 0.5- mL dose of BEXSERO is formulated to contain 50 micrograms each of recombinant proteins Neisserial adhesin A (NadA), Neisserial Heparin Binding Antigen (NHBA), and factor H binding protein (fHbp), 25 micrograms of Outer Membrane Vesicles (OMV), 1.5 mg aluminum hydroxide (0.519 mg of 3.125 mg sodi um chloride, 0.776 mg histidine, and 10 mg sucrose at pH 6.4 - 6.7. The NadA component is a fragment of the full -length protein derived from N. meningitidis strain 2996 (peptide 8 variant 2/3)5. The NHBA component is a recombinant fusion protein comprised of NHBA (peptide 2)5 and accessory protein 953 derived from N. meningitidis strains NZ98/254 and 2996, respectively. The fHbp component is a recombinant fusion protein comprised of fHbp (variant 1.1) 5 and the accessory protein 936 derived from N. meningiti dis strains MC58 and 2996, respectively. These 3 recombinant proteins are indi vidually produced in Escherichia coli and purified through a series of column chromatography steps. The OMV antigenic component is produced by fermentation of N. meningitidis strain NZ98/254 (expressing outer membrane protein PorA serosubtype P1.4) 6, followed by inactivation of the bacteria by deoxycholate, which also mediates vesicle formation. The antigens are adsorbed onto aluminum hydroxide. Each dose contains less than 0.01 m icrograms kanamycin (by calculation). 9 12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Protection a gainst invasive meningococcal disease is conferred mainly by complement -mediat ed antibody- dependent killing of N. meningitidis . The effectiveness of BEXSERO was assessed by measuring serum bactericidal activity using human complement (hSBA). NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA are proteins found on the surface of meningococci and contribute to the ability of the bacterium to cause disease. Vaccination with BEXSERO leads to the production of antibodies directed against NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4 (present in OMV) meningococci to complement -mediated antibo dy-dependent killing following vaccination with BEXSERO is dependent on both the antigenic similarity of the bacterial and vaccine antigens, as well as the amount of antigen expr essed on the surface of the invading meningococci. 13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility BEXSERO has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential or impairment of male fertility in animals . Vaccination of female rabbits with BEXSERO had no effect on fertility. [See Use in Specific Populations (8.1).] 14 CLINICAL STUDIES The immunogenicity of BEXSERO following 2 doses was evaluated in individuals aged 11 through 24 years. Serum bactericidal antibodies were measured with hSBA assays using 3 strai ns selected to measure responses to one of 3 vaccine antigens, either fHbp, NadA , or PorA P1.4, prevalent among strains in the U .S. A suitable strain for assessing bactericidal activity of NHBA - specific antibodies was not available. Studies assessed the pr oportion of subjects who achieved a 4-fold or greater increase in hSBA titer for each of the 3 strains, and the proportion of subjects with a titer greater than or equal to the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay for all 3 strains (composite re sponse). The LLOQ was defined as the lowest amount of the antibody in a sample that can be reliably quantified. Available data showed that baseline antibody titers across populations vary. 14.1 Immunogenicity In a clinical trial conducted in Canada and Australia, adolescents aged 11 through 17 years received 2 doses of BEXSERO 1 month apart. The hSBA responses 1 month after the second dose are shown in Table 2. 10 Table 2.
