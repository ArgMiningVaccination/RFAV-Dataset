Discover a different approach to healing Homeopathy is a unique system of medicine that works by stimulating the body to heal itself. Rather than suppressing symptoms, homeopathy helps restore the body to a more balanced state naturally. It is a non-toxic, gentle, and effective therapy that can be used for acute and chronic conditions. It is widely used across the world, and is safe for patients of all ages, including infants, pregnant and nursing mothers, and the elderly. What Are Homeopathic Medicines? Homeopathic medicines are derived from natural sources, often plants or minerals. During their preparation, the homeopathic medicines undergo a series of dilutions so that hardly any of the original substance remains. One of the main benefits of this dilution process is that the resulting medicine is quite safe and non-toxic. These potentized, highly dilute medicines are delivered via small sugar pellets, about the size of a BB pellet. The homeopathic medicines that I prescribe come in a small glass vial, are manufactured in the United States by a pharmacy, and are regulated by the FDA. The pellets dissolve quickly in the mouth, allowing for easy administration to even small children or older patients who may have difficulty swallowing pills. "}
