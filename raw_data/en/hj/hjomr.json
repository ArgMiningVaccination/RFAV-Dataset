CHAIRSEN. DIRECTORMICHAEL T. CHILDRESSThe Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center was created by the General Assembly in1992 to bring a broader context to the decisionmaking process. The Center's mission is toilluminate the long-range implications of current policies, emerging issues, and trendsinfluencing the Commonwealth's future. The Center has a responsibility to identify and studyissues of long-term significance to the Commonwealth and to serve as a mechanism forcoordinating resources and groups to focus on long-range planning. iii In Memory ofVic Hellard, Jr.1939-1996 \"It's easy to attack governmenteasy but wrongheaded. For government is as good as we are. Theplain fact is, we are government.\"Vic Hellard, 1996The staff and the Board of the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research dedicate this, our sec-ond biennial trends report, to the memory of our colleague and our friend, Vic Hellard, Jr.,without whom neither this volume nor this Center would exist. As in so many instances, Vicwas the behind-the-scenes innovator who recognized and advanced the concept of a future-oriented research center that would examine and report on the long-range implications of publicpolicy. We are here today, reporting on trends influencing the future before the Commonwealth,because of Vic Hellard. Just as he championed and helped shape an independent General As-sembly, he envisioned an agency dedicated to informing and enriching the public dialogue aboutthe future. With this volume and in all the work we do, we are striving to realize this vision.But Vic was so much more than a man of ideas. Until his death on September 17, 1996, Vicserved as a driving force on the Center's Board of Directors, providing invaluable direction andguidance, shepherding us through our early years, tirelessly promoting Center research and ini-tiatives in the public arena, and dedicating immense energy to the Board's roll-up-your-sleeveswork. For all of us, Vic was an inspiration and a compass. He was a public servant in the truestsense of the word, who kept the good of the Commonwealth at heart and quietly led with thepower of his ideas. What's more, Vic was a kind and caring man who gave generously of him-self. To say that he is sadly missed is to say too little. Instead, we offer this work not only inmemory of Vic Hellard, Jr., but as a small part of his immense but often unsung legacy. Preface This report was prepared as part of the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center's mis-sion to serve as a catalyst to change the way decisions are made in government by providingpolicymakers a broader context in which to make decisions, taking into consideration the long-term implications of policy, critical trends, and emerging issues which may have a significantimpact on the state. This, our second biennial trends report, includes articles from experts in avariety of fields who contributed chapters on subjects ranging from demographic trends to citi-zen participation in government. It will be of particular interest to policymakers and citizenswho are concerned about improving prospects for a bright future in the Commonwealth.Several of our authors examine trends in financial and economic data, such as wages, gov-ernment spending, and income. In cases where they adjusted to real dollars they had to use theconsumer price index (CPI), as these chapters were written during the spring and summer of1996. This is significant because in December of 1996, a congressionally appointed panel pre-sented recommendations to improve the government's measure of inflation. The panel also es-timated that the CPI overstates inflation by a percentage point or more each year. As a result,time-series economic and financial data, when adjusted to real dollars using the CPI, would tendtounderstatereal growth. Thus, using a new measure of inflation, real wages, for example,would have grown faster than they appear to when using the CPI to adjust the data. KENTUCKY LONG-TERM POLICY RESEARCH CENTERThe Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center was created by the General Assembly in1992 to bring a broader context to the decision-making process. The Center's mission is to il-luminate the long-range implications of current policies, emerging issues, and trends influenc-ing the Commonwealth's future. The Center has a responsibility to identify and study issues oflong-term significance to the Commonwealth and to serve as a mechanism for coordinatingresources and groups to focus on long-term planning.Governing the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center is a 21-member board of direc-tors that includes four appointees from the executive branch, six from the legislative branch,and 11 at-large members representing citizen groups, universities, local governments, and theprivate sector. From the at-large component of the board, six members are appointed by theGovernor and five by the Legislative Research Commission. In accordance with its authorizinglegislation, the Center is attached to the legislative branch of Kentucky state government. Themakeup of its board, however, affords it functional independence and permits it to serve boththe executive and legislative branches of government equally, as well as the public.Michael T. Childress is the executive director of the Center.

It contains a lively andprovocative discussion of issues and trends that will significantly affect Kentucky's future.Of course, both positive and negative trends are identified in this report, as well as a healthydose of uncertainty. It has become a clich\u00e9 in recent years, but bears repeating here: The onlycertainty about the future is change. Nevertheless, the trends identified by the contributors tothis report need to be seriously considered by those interested in the future of our state.None of these trends is etched into stone. We, the citizens of Kentucky, possess the power toshape the course of our future, and this discussion should inform our efforts to do so. I amreminded of a passage from A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens:\"Are these the shadows of the things that Will be, or are they shadows of things thatMay be, only? ... Men's courseswill foreshadow certain they must lead . .. Butif the courses be departed from, the ends will change.\"We believe, as Dickens sought to show us in his timeless story of renewal and reversal offortunes, that we indeed can affect the course of our state's future. Moreover, we believe thatpolicymakers and citizens alike can use this report to help chart a path toward a moreprosperous and more enlightened future. The key to Kentucky's future lies in our ability toembrace change while respecting our traditions and our history.Dr. Paul B.

KlotterKentucky Historical SocietyIn the twenty-fourth century B.C., a writer introduced his work with the words, \"Teach himwhat has been said in the past . ..for there is none born wise.\" In our era of such rapidchange, almost daily, some question the need to look at a past moving so rapidly behind us.Others argue that we must only look forward, not at what has gone on before us. Yet, in truth, theneed to study the past as we look to the future is greater than ever before.One of the great constants in history has been change, of some sort, in every generation.Many ages try to avoid dealing with the transformation all around them; others try to adjust butoperate in a historical vacuum. Those who do ignore history function without benefit of context.They do not understand how others before them adapted to changefailed to do soand all theycan do is to improvise, needlessly, over and over again, amid a series of crises. Reacting withoutperspective, they resemble those in Greek mythology who drank from the river Lethe in Hades.Those who sipped from the stream lost their memory and became endless wanderers, withoutpurpose, without history, without direction. The Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Centerand those interested in Kentucky's future are seeking to make certain that future generationsnever drink from those waters.At the same time, slavish devotion to the past is as dangerous as too little. Looking onlybackward, avoiding the need to confront and shape change, has been a debilitating trend atdifferent times in Kentucky history. The key, then, is to identify what parts of the present andpast to leave behind and what aspects to take forward into new eras. It is important not only toask questions, but to understand what questions must be asked. Contributors to this biennialtrends report not only identify current trends and place them in historical context, they alsosuggest what elements will most influence the Kentucky of the 21st century. They seek answersto the right questions.Looking back over the 19th and 20th centuries, historians have noted a depressing trend, forthe words spoken and the issues defined seem to be repeated from decade to decade. A publicfigure telling an audience that Kentucky needs better roads, more jobs, and more funds foreducation, could be found whether that audience arrived by horse-drawn carriage or by airplane.For example, an 1884 writer concluded that \"The educational problem is by far the most seriousof all the difficulties before this state.\" Over six decades later, a study emphasized the,\"Amazingly high degree of correlation between what a state invests in education and the standardof living of its people.\" Some 30 years after that an ex-governor declared, \"You can't have aprogressive state without an adequate educational system.\"On issue after issue, year after year, words were heard calling for change. What is the role ofgovernment in the state? What about gender and racial equality? Opportunities for young people?Out-of-state ownership of vital industries? And on and on. Moreover, Kentuckians spoke aboutwhat might be called the soul of the state. How can we keep that which gives us a sense of place,a personality, a uniqueness? How can we make certain we think locally andglobally? How canwe ensure we are both history-minded andfuture-minded? Governor Bert Combs, in his lastspeech as chief executive, spoke for that concern when he concluded, in 1963, \"These have beenyears of great change in the world and in our state . ..Yet ...it is the spirit that survives, andthe spirit of Kentucky is strong. We may change . ..but the spirit of Kentucky endures.\" BarryBingham, Sr., spoke to those same desires for both change and continuity when he explainedwhat his hometown sought, which was, in a sense, what Kentucky desired as well: \"What we 21 2Exploring the Frontier of the Future want is a modern city that still remembers the past, as old bricks remember the sun of manysummers and the soft rains of a hundred autumns. That is what gives them character andbeauty.\" Kentuckians seek to build their future on such solid foundations.Can we? Looking at past studies and recommendations for change sometimes does notprovide a hopeful answer. At the end of World War II, for instance, three different book-lengthworks offered blueprints for Kentucky's next half-century. They called for a new constitution,higher teachers' salaries, better access to medical care, more environmental controls, a higherminimum wage, greater emphasis on historical and tourist site development, and furthereconomic diversity, among other things. As one reads these words now, many of the suggestionsstill address our current needs.Yet on the other hand, reviewing past decades also provides hope for the future; historicalstudy shows that individuals can make a difference, and that major change has taken place inmany arenas. To name only a few examples, Kentuckians of 1900 lived in a racially segregatedsociety, with women in a second-class status, by law; most lived in a world without electricity orsecurity for the aged, a place of poor health care and shorter lives, a neighborhood of limitedtransportation, geography, and communication.As the children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren of those Kentuckians, we oftenthink, as we look to the future, that no other generation has had to deal with change in themagnitude that we now face. In many ways, that is correct. However, each generation has facedits own circumstances and has experienced transformation as a result. For example, thatgeneration of 1900 soon saw humans fly in heavier-than-air machines for the first time; peopleno longer were bound to the Earth, a huge mental jump for them to make. The generation ofWorld WarIIhadtofacegreat Over a half-century ago, one futurist destruction and death. The post Worldstudy for the Commonwealth proclaimed, WarIIgenerationhaswitnessed\"We are at the end of an epoch ...different types of change: tripsthatp Kentucky's true greatness lies ahead.\" previously took months now take a day;information that would take weeks or If we repeat those words now, the possibility days to be assembled and disseminated of making them come true is much greater now emanates in minutes or hours: The now than before. statemovedfromanagriculturaleconomy to a more diversified one, andbecame statistically more urban than rural. At the same time poverty, inequality, and other issuescontinued. In short, each Kentucky generation has faced challenges and change, perhaps as greatto them as those in the 21st century will be to another generation.A participant in another place told of the spirit that Governor Combs spoke about, a spiritpresent in Kentucky as it moved toward statehood over two centuries ago. After a frontier battle,one of the participants wrote, \"On the morrow we shall bury thein. We shall weep for them, as wehave for all who have died, but we shall go on living, and one day we shall overcome thisperilous wilderness.\"With that attitude and will, early Kentuckians did persevere and succeed. Kentucky's presentgeneration faces its own perils, and, like that earlier one, its own promises as well. Physicalfrontiers, such as space, may still exist, but the primary frontiers to be conquered now are morethose of technology and of the mind. Yet that same frontier spirit can prevail, with planning,with leadership, with long-term thinking.Over a half-century ago, one futurist study for the Commonwealth proclaimed, \"We are atthe end of an epoch ..Kentucky's true greatness lies ahead.\" If we repeat those words now, thepossibility of making them come true is much greater now than before. This trends report allowsus to plan for future epochs, as it helps us realize also that \"there is none born wise.\"22 Section IThe White Picket Fence:Trends Affecting the Quality of Life inKentucky Communities The poet Maya Angelou once said that all people are linked by the dream of a white picketfence. She explained that we all desire satisfying work, a healthy family, and a house, yardand flowers surrounded by a white picket fence. The fence borders a tree-lined street with avariety of houses and fences. Two or three blocks away is a major thoroughfare where we can ride abus or drive our car past the neighborhood school and convenience center into a busy and prosper-ous downtown.Just as we yearn for each picket fence to have a fresh coat of white paint, we want our neighbor-hood and city centers to be well designed and enjoyable. We want downtown to have a mix of spe-cial stores, banks, theaters, housing, offices, hospitals, libraries, and restaurants. We want this livingcenter to exhibit the history of the community in its businesses, buildings, monuments, festivals,parades and parks. While we are proud of our efficient new shopping malls on the edge of town, weknow they are not a substitute for the downtown heart of the community.The phrase \"quality of life\" is being used by more people to describe a desirable community, andin the future quality of life will continue to gain credence in more segments of society. Decisionsabout business location and expansion will consider small towns as well as larger cities for theirquality of life. Young professionals looking to relocate and take new jobs will also review one-by-one such aspects of quality as housing, schools, medical services, historic buildings and sites, lawenforcement, libraries, transportation, shops, festivals, sports, arts and entertainment, parks, andmuseums.On the surface, the combination of well-cared-for neighborhoods and schools, shiny shoppingmalls, active theaters and museums, and a vibrant downtown center create the image of a high qual-ity of life within the community. A look beneath the surface, however, reveals the need for criticalingredients such as diverse economic and educational opportunities, concern for good design, re-spect for history, accessible cultural resources, a plan/vision for the future, strong families, andbroad citizen participation in community leadership.What are the trends that impact our quality of life? Certainly, there are basic needs, like housing,health care, safety, dignity, and strong families. Trends in these areas are examined in this sectionby: F. Lynn Luallen, Housing Trends; Forrest Calico, The View from the Heart of the Health CareRevolution; John Curra, The Contours of Crime; Saundra Ardrey, Kentucky and the State of HumanRights; and Stephan Wilson, Families and Children. Another basic need that affects our quality oflife is a job paying adequate wages, something a large segment of our population obviously lacks, ashighlighted by Miriam Fordham and Dan Jacovitch in their chapter, Poverty in Kentucky. There isclearly a need for broad access to lifelong education and training to maintain and improve personalknowledge and income.Another important trend is the expanding recognition of the importance of heritage and historyto the lives of citizens within communities, and to tourists from outside the community. Well builtand historically significant buildings are being re-used for housing and commercial developments This introduction was prepared by Lou DeLuca, the Executive Director, Office of Operations and Development, within the Edu-cation, Arts and Humanities Cabinet. 03 4Exploring the Frontier of the Future because, in addition to saving resources, they preserve the heritage of a community and provide atourist attraction.Graham Row les and John Watkins describe the trend toward an older population and longerretirements in their chapter, Growing Old in Kentucky in the Approaching Age of Age. The aging ofthe population provides a growing audience with interest in heritage, history, arts, and crafts. Acompanion trend has been the out-migration from Kentucky of a younger, educated populationlooking for a \"better life.\" Perhaps the most interesting new trend is the movement of these sameyoung people, as well as many older professionals, back from large cities to smaller communities inorder to improve their quality of life, as discussed by Michael Price in Migration in Kentucky. Theseeducated citizens will demand that their communities develop their local museums, housing options,historic buildings, public libraries, arts performances, and downtown design in order to meet theirstandards of quality.Increased access to lifelong education, heritage, arts, and humanities will also be achievedthrough easily accessible \"virtual universities,\" on-line public libraries, inter-active local historymuseums, and arts performances in the workplace. Equally important will be the trend toward \"onestop shopping\" which results from the increased demands on family time and increased hours de-voted to work. An example is the packaging and marketing of convenient parking and dining as partof an evening out at the theater. Likewise, a community that wants to attract tourists interested inheritage and arts will package those attractions with lodging, dining and shopping.The desire for an improved quality of life is evidenced in the Kentucky Strategic Plan for Eco-nomic Development which calls for government to \"promote and develop Kentucky's cultural andhistorical assets as an economic tool because Kentucky has a rich culture and history which helpdefine the Commonwealth's identity and quality of life.\"As communities see the need to develop their cultural assets, they will include cultural planningand development in their community economic/tourism development plan. The trend toward col-laborative economic and cultural planning will have an impact on local communities as well as onstate government. A good example is Governor Patton's announcement of Renaissance Kentucky, aprogram which seeks to improve Kentucky downtowns, large and small, by linking economic devel-opment with housing, tourism, infrastructure, urban design, and cultural development. Also recog-nizing this need, the Kentucky Education, Arts & Humanities Cabinet and its 13 member agencieslaunched a program in 1995 called the Cultural Economics Initiative. This program provided asmall grant and technical assistance to 30 Kentucky communities to help them inventory and ana-lyze their cultural/historic resources and integrate them into a larger economic development plan.Community planning for the development of cultural assets as economic tools is of increasingimportance because of other identified trends. Decreasing government and philanthropic funding forcultural institutions is creating a need for more earned income to sustain nonprofits, and more busi-ness sponsorship and marketing of events which provide exposure and good will such as educationand community service. With the need to broaden the audience will come the need to offer audience-driven programming and \"info-tainment,\" thereby requiring cultural institutions to adjust to enter-taining as well as conveying content.The education, arts and humanities community attempts to interpret the past and look to the fu-ture. As the level and accessibility of distance educational and cultural offerings increase, there willbe a demand for an enhanced quality of lifethe building of a community white picket fencethrough more locally planned and produced education, arts, heritage, environmental, and humani-ties programs. 24 Migration in Kentucky:Will the Circle Be Unbroken? Kentucky's migration history for much of the 20th century reveals an exodus from rural areas and an at-traction of migrants to the state's urban areas. Out-migration has resulted in a brain drain for rural areasbecause newcomers to the state's rural areas have been less educated than those leaving; on the other hand,recent migration in urban areas has enhanced the human capital of the state, as those coming in are slightlymore educated than those leaving. Overall, migration signifies two important trends in Kentucky for the nextcentury: the aging of the population and non-economic migration. By Michael Price*University of Louisville/n this twentieth century, Kentucky's most characteristic demographic event has been the depar-ture of our native sons and daughters. The out-migration of young adults has plagued communi-ties from Louisville to Pikeville to Fulton, often signifying opportunities lost for the places leftbehind. From 1910 to 1990, migrants leaving Kentucky have outnumbered those moving to the stateby over one million. In the 1950s alone, the exchange of migrants over the state border resulted in anet loss of nearly 400,000 people. As the consequence of out-migration over decades, two of everyfive native-born Kentuckians alive in 1990 lived outside the Commonwealth.'From 1990 to 1995, however, the tide of migration streams turned, and 82,000 more peoplemoved into Kentucky than moved out. The only other period of sustained net in-migration in thiscentury occurred during the 1970s. Is this recent population turnaround a harbinger of our demo-graphic future as we enter the next century? Or is it only a temporary aberration, a short-liveddemographic event that portends little about the size and composition of our communities or ouremerging social order?Recent migration to Kentucky has often been a homecoming. Many who left the state in theiryouth have returned for their retirement years. Among those 55 years old or older, one of every twomigrants moving to Kentucky during the 1985-90 period was a native born Kentuckian? This returnof the natives is significant, not for the current volume of migration, but because it is part and parcelof more salient social demographic trends dealing with an aging population and non-economic mi-gration.In this chapter, we look at migration in Kentucky. To better understand where Kentucky is go-ing, we need to better understand how Kentuckians are moving. One of the basic tenets of migrationtheory states that for every migration stream there is a counterstream.3 Through this selective ex-change of people and households, migration impacts the size, composition, and distribution of thepopulation. Although migration has become an increasingly important component of growth andchange in Kentucky, our knowledge of migration is often limited to the residual of the demographicequation.4 The examination of migration residuals or nets shows how much a population changes asthe result of the movement of people, but not how it changes. Migration activity is better explained * The author wishes to thank Drs. Thomas Ford and John F.

Rural Losses and Urban GainsKentucky's migration history in the 20th century reveals a dramatic pattern of uneven develop-ment between rural and urban areas. Urban-rural are defined herein by the Census Bureau's metro-politan county designation. Metropolitan status is examined after each census based on changes inpopulationsizeanddensity, commuting pat-terns,and employmentcomposition. Urban areashave generally had netgains from migration inthis century, resulting inthe exchange of relativelylarge volumes of in- andout-migrants(see,forexample,Table1.3).However, a massive exo-dus from rural areas hasoften overshadowed net in-migration in the state's urban areas. As shown in Table 1.1, from 1940 to1970, rural Kentucky had net out-migration of 900,000. Meanwhile, the state's urban areas attracted136,000 more migrants than departed. During the 1950s, net migration decreased the population ofrural areas by 20 percent.Many of those who left have been young adults. During the out-migration of the 1950s, Ken-tucky experienced a net loss of 134,000 persons who were 20-29 years old, 30 percent of this agecohort. Young persons have a general propensity to move more than other segments of the popula-tion. Life-cycle options dealing with higher education, career choice, and marriage often involverelocation. Young people in Kentucky, especially those from rural areas, have been the most likelyto leave home. Rates of net out-migration for young adults, as shown in Table 1.2, have been two tothree times greater than those for the total population since 1950.TABLE 1.1Net Migration in Urban and Rural Kentucky 1940-1995*PeriodStateNumberPercentUrban Areas**NumberPercentRural Areas**NumberPercent1940-1950-232,431-8.283,11911.8-315,550-14.71950-1960-389,546-13.233,5354.0-423,081-20.21960-1970-154,046-5.119,5891.7-173,635-9.11970-1980206,2376.42690.0205,96812.01980-1990-171,678-4.7-68,283-4.1-103,395-5.21990-199581,8622.223,7111.358,1513.0Percent net migration is the net migration number divided by the population at the be-ginning of the period multiplied by 100.Urban areas are metropolitan counties and rural areas are nonmetropolitan counties asdesignated at the end of each time period.Sources: US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service and Calculations ofauthor. 26 Migration in Kentucky: Will the Circle Be Unbroken? 7 TABLE 1.2Net Migration by Age in Kentucky, 1950-19901950-19601960-19701970-19801980-1990(000s)%(000s)%(000s)%(000s)%All Ages-389-13.2-154-5.12066.4-171-4.70-9-54-8.6-27-4.1142.4-17-3.110-19-77-15.1-17-3.16710.4-31-5.120-29-133-29.8-86-23.6102.3-74-12.030-39-66-16.8-17.-4.6329.3-22-4.640-49-32-9.7-6-1.7257.0-16-4.650-59-17-6.4-2-0.8226.9-2-0.860-69.4-2.142.2208.1170.070 and over-2-2.0-1-0.9125.8-6-1.9Age is measured as of end of each decade.Sources: US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, and calculations of author.Moreover, mi-grationhasde-pletedruralKentuckyofitsmost valuable hu-manresources.Out-migration hasselectednot onlytheyoung,butoftenthemoreeducated,ambi-tious, and coura-geous. The out-migration of young adults over decades has contributed to an undereducated work-force and a decline in fertility in rural areas. The more educated and skilled often find local job op-portunities limited; their resultant departure decreases the human capital of the labor force. Youngadults are also the most fertile segment of the population and their loss in combination with declin-ing birth rates has resulted in a drop in the number of births in many rural areas.Urban areas in Kentucky, on the other hand, have generally attracted migrants. Cities and sub-urbs have collectively experienced net in-migration in every decade since 1940, except the 1970-80decade. Over this century, Kentucky's urban areas have ridden the waves of industrial growth, dein-dustrialization, and postindustrial development. Each wave of development has been associated with In-migrants and Out-migrantsTABLE 1.3by Age, Urban and Rural Kentucky, 1985-1990State Migrants Urban Migrants Rural MigrantsInOutInOutInOut#%#%#%#%#%#%(000s)(000s)(000s)(000s)(000s)(000s)All Migrants304100298100218100210100189100191100(5+ yrs, 1990)5-197825.77324.55023.05023.85328.04825.220-298528.29230.96932.06129.04926.36434.030-448728.78528.76429.46330.44825.64724.645-643712.33110.72310.62411.62613.81910.365+155.1155.2105.0115.2116.2115.9Source: 1990 Census of Population and Housing, STP28-Special County to County Migration Tally.major population movements. In the first half of the century, rural to urban migration enabled Ash-land, Covington, Louisville, and other cities to meet the massive labor requirements of industriali-zation. Beginning in the 1970s, the downsizing of manufacturing and the deindustrializationassociated with the Rust Belt coincided with the labor force entrance of the first Baby Boomers. Anoversupply of labor resulted in out-migration from Kentucky's major cities. Kentucky's urban areas,however, have led the state into the transition from a goods-producing economy to one based oninformation. Exemplified by the growth of Lexington, Kentucky's cities currently compete forskilled and educated workers in a national and global marketplace.As the state's urban populations have grown, they have become more dispersed. Out-migrationfrom the state's older, industrial central cities has been countered by growth in the suburbs and ex-urban areas. Metropolitan counties5 in Kentucky have steadily increased in number from six in 1960to eight in 1970, 17 in 1980, 20 in 1990, and 22 in 1995. Moreover, peripheral metropolitan coun-ties, those without a major central city, like Boone and Oldham, have been among the fastest grow-ing counties in the state over the last three decades. 5 Metropolitan counties are those that comprise Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), a Census Bureau designation. Counties areadded to MSAs based on thresholds of population density and growth, commuting patterns, and employment structure. 8Exploring the Frontier of the FutureRural Growth in the 1970sThe only decade of sustained population growth and net in-migration for rural Kentucky in thiscentury was the 1970s. Migrants to rural Kentucky in this decade outnumbered those leaving byover 200,000. The Kentucky experience was part of a national rural renaissance, and several factorscontributed to this population turnaround. The oil embargo by Middle East nations led to increasedproduction and speculation in Kentucky's fossil fuel industries. Employment in coal mining alsoincreased. In addition, innovations in production and transportation facilitated the relocation ofmanufacturing firms to rural locales to take advantage of lower labor and other costs. As a result,the demand for rural labor increased, retaining local workers and attracting newcomers. These eco-nomic factors were complimented by urban to rural migration that was not economically motivated.Many moved to rural areas to enhance the quality of their lives, removing themselves from the con-gestion, pollution, and rat race associated with urban life. Rural areas presented the promise of asimpler, more gratifying lifestyle.6Kentucky's rural turnaround was short-lived, however. By the end of the 1970s, demand for ru-ral workers had fallen and net out-migration had returned. During the 1980s, rural Kentucky expe-rienced net out-migration once again, losing 100,000 people, 5 percent of its population.Recent Migration TABLE 1.4In-migrants and Out-migrants by Age and 1990 Census of Population and Housing, STP28-Special County to County Migration Tally.Following a decade of stagnant population growth, Kentucky in the 1990s has been on a growthtrajectory. From 1980 to 1990, the state population rose by less than 1 percent. In the first half ofthis decade, however, the number of Kentuckians has increased by 173,000 or 5 percent. Recentgrowth has been fueled by net in-migration which has benefited rural areas more than urban areas.Net migration resulted in gains of 58,000 in rural areas and 24,000 in urban areas. 6 For a review of the rural population turnaround in the U.S. during the 1970s, see Brown, D.L. and Wardwell, J.M. (Eds.). (1980).New directions in urban-rural migration: The population turnaround in rural America. New York: Academic Press.28 Migration in Kentucky: Will the Circle Be Unbroken? 9 Many of the recent migrants to rural Kentucky have been older, beyond their fertile years. Dur-ing the recent growth, fertility in rural Kentucky has decreased while mortality has increased. Whilethese changes are primarily the result of aging in place of the population and a general decline infertility rates, recent migration, by sometimes replacing the young with the old, has contributed to ashift in the balance of natural increase in rural areas.7 Natural increase is the demographic term forpopulation growth resulting from the difference between the number of births and deaths. As pre-sented in Table 1.3, recent in-migrants to rural areas have been more likely than recent out-migrantsto be aged 45 years and older; those leaving rural areas were more likely to be younger adults. Dur-ing the 1985-1990 period, one third of the out-migrants from rural Kentucky were 20-29 years old.Recent migration in Kentucky, moreover, has resulted in a brain drain for rural areas. Newcom-ers to the state's rural area have been less educated than those who left. As shown in Table 1.4, ofmigrants aged 25 years and over who exited rural areas during the 1985-1990 period, 23 percenthad obtained a bachelor's degree or higher. Only 17 percent of the comparable in-migration streamwere college educated. However, older migrants with less educational attainment may be loweringthe overall education levels on the rural migration instream. However, even looking at the educationof younger adults alone, the same pattern is shown. Recent migrants aged 25-34 years coming torural Kentucky were less educated than their counterparts who left.In urban areas of Kentucky, on the other hand, recent migration has reflected the dynamics ofthe postindustrial economy and the increasing demand for human capital. Gross migration, the sumof in- and out-streams, in urban areas has been 10 percent higher than in rural areas, and urban mi-grants whether entering or leaving are more educated than their rural counterparts. Roughly onethird of recent in-migrants and out-migrants had a college degree. Those coming to urban areas,however, were slightly more educated than those leaving. Moreover, in-migrants were more likely tobe young adults, 20-29 years old, than out-migrants. Migration in recent years has enhanced thehuman capital of the state's urban areas.Implications for the 21st CenturyAs noted earlier, coming home is a significant aspect of recent migration in Kentucky. Given thevolume of out-migration over past decades, one may speculate on the prospects for a massive returnof natives in coming decades. Likely to increase in volume, this migration is important because itsignifies two emerging trends for the next century. These trends are non-economic migration andthe well documented aging of the population.Non-economic migration is motivated by the desire to improve the quality of one's life morethan one's economic condition. Rural homesteaders, part of the back-to-the-land movement, repre-sent in many ways the essence of this migration; and while they are present in Kentucky, their num-bers are small. Non-economic migration, however, is typically supported by economic means andincludes the migration of retirees and the movement of urban populations to the rural fringe of met-ropolitan areas, two migration streams which are relatively large in Kentucky and expected to in-crease in volume.Kentucky is very likely to be a major destination for retirees in the next century. The state'sabundance of natural amenities is certainly a strong draw. Recent rural migration has been strongestto areas near the state's large recreational lakes, for example. States will be in competition with eachother for retirees, much like they are today for automobile manufacturing plants. Competition willincrease as Baby Boomers, who prepared for retirement with pensions, savings, and investments,exit the labor force.Migration to the rural outskirts of the metropolitan areas reflects increases in household incomeand changes in the geography of economic activity. Although these trends generally indicate im-provement in the quality of life, there are potential problems to consider. Residential developmentspush farther into the rural landscape often manifesting in gated enclaves for the well-off. Themovement of urban workers and their families to the rural setting has involved, almost exclusively, 7 See Kentucky State Data Center. (1996, Spring/Summer). Kentucky State ettfenter News, 14. 10Exploring the Frontier of the Future the relocation of middle- and upper-income whites. The centrifugal redistribution of metropolitanpopulations has resulted in greater geographic separation among races and ethnic groups and be-tween rich and poor. Louisville, Covington, and other central cities have become increasingly com-prised of minority and poverty populations. Moreover, the movement of urbanites to rural areas onthe metropolitan fringe can strain the institutional infrastructure of the receiving communities.Problems of institutional overload may arise as the influx of new migrants places demands in excessof the carrying capacity of local schools and services.Despite a general shift in population towards the hinterland, rural areas have not stemmed thetide of youth migration. Recent population growth has masked the ongoing departure of youngadults. The out-migration of youth, combined with the recent in-migration of retirees, has shiftedthe age structure of some rural areas towards the top. Consequently, from 1990 to 1995, the numberof deaths exceeded the number of live births in 13 rural counties.8 Unless areas such as.these sustaina regular stream of in-migration, they will depopulate.The long-term out-migration of young people has resulted in labor shortages, especially for entrylevel and seasonal workers. To fill this void, we see, at least anecdotally, the beginning of a newmigration stream to Kentucky with origins south of the U.S. border. Migrant Latino farm laborerscan be seen in Kentucky cutting and stripping tobacco. A chicken processing plant in a rural Ken-tucky county is raided by the Immigration and Naturalization Service for hiring illegal Hispanicaliens. Over time, seasonal farm labor migration has resulted in the permanent settlement of Latinosfrom Texas to Michigan. As Kentucky begins to participate in the mid-continent labor migrationstream, we will see if Latino newcomers are readily accepted by the heretofore homogeneous hostcommunities.The influx of retirees and exurbanites brings new wealth to rural locales. Population growth alsoincreases the demand for service jobs. Whether newcomers, however, will be a new source of vitalityand entrepreneurship for their host communities is uncertain. Migrants may oppose economic de-velopment which they perceive as a threat to the rural lifestyle they desire. In addition, new residen-tial uses Of rural land compete with traditional agricultural land use, making it more difficult forfarm families to stay in agriculture, especially from generation to generation. /We can expect thatmany rural communities will be dramatically transformed vis-a-vis their differential flows of in- andout-migration.That so many have wanted to come home, and have, bodes well for Kentucky. Moreover, since1970, Kentucky has generally gained more migrants than we have lost; and the departure of youngadults has slowed. Whether native or non-native, urban worker or rural retiree, Kentucky has be-come a desirable destination. We will see if returning natives help ease the problems so often asso-ciated with an influx of migrants. Sociocultural differences between newcomers and old-timers maylead to a conflict situation, or culture clash, in the values and normative expectations between thetwo groups. Hopefully, migrants coming home to Kentucky, who left years ago because of undesir-able circumstances, are aware and concerned that many of those same problems persist for today'syouth. 30 8 See Kentucky State Data Center.

Growing Old in Kentucky:The Approaching Age of Age Circumstances are good and improving for some of the Commonwealth's elders in comparison withtheir peers nationally. For others, however, little has changed over the past few decades. Older'Kentuckians remain disproportionately poor. Considerable regional variations exist in the economic statusof our elderly population. With respect to some selected indicators, the situation of our elders mayactually be deteriorating. Policymakers must consider how the next generation of elders will experiencegrowing old in Kentucky. The experience will be what we choose to make it. By Graham D. Row les and John F. WatkinsUniversity of KentuckyK'entucky can bea wonderful place in which to grow old. For Arnold, a 67-year-oldexecutive from Indianapolis and his wife (part of the small but significant stream ofelderly migrants who have retired to Pulaski County on the shores of Lake Cumberland),our Commonwealth offers a temperate climate, natural scenic beauty, a slow pace of life, a lowcost of living, and the chance to experience a genuine sense of rural community. For those withmore urban tastes, like 73 year-old retired teacher Evelyn who moved to the state to be near herdaughter, Lexington offers a range of upscale retirement community living options In anamenity-rich city well served by medical facilities and educational and cultural resources. Thereare opportunities to participate in the University of Kentucky's Donovan Scholars program,' toenjoy the resources of the Center for Creative Living, to dine at a wide range of restaurants, andeven to spend a day at the races.But there is also another Kentucky, a place experienced by large numbers of our less affluentand less fortunate elders. For Leroy, an 86-year-old lifelong resident of Owsley County who hasboth mobility and self care limitations, there is the day-to-day struggle of living alone in asubstandard dwelling without a telephone, without access to a vehicle and on an income belowpoverty. For 88- year-old Cicely, a widow living in poor quality housing in inner city Louisville,problems of inadequate resources are exacerbated by fears of crime and violence and by the evenmore invidious slights of neglect. This Kentucky is not such a good place in which to grow old.In this chapter, we summarize trends in the growth of Kentucky's elderly population andprovide a description of the current status of this population with respect to an array of indices oflife circumstances and well-being. We present the argument that circumstances for some of theCommonwealth's elders are good and improving in comparison with their peers in the remainderof the nation. However, for others little has changed over the past few decades. There remainsconsiderable regional variation in the status of our elderly population. Especially in the easternportion of the state, there has been little improvement with respect to multiple indices of well-being. Indeed, with respect to selected indicators, the situation of some of our elders may actuallybe deteriorating.Against this backdrop, we identify several recent trends, both national and local, that arelikely to shape the future of Kentucky's elderly population. Finally, we present a somewhatspeculative look into the crystal ball to present an image of the future of aging in our state andwhat we can do to ensure that it is a bright one for all Kentuckians.31The Donovan Scholars program provides free educational opportunities for senior citizens. 12Exploring the Frontier of the FutureTrends in the Growth of Kentucky's Elderly Population 1970 1980 1990In1930,theelderlypopulationofKentuckynumbered just over 142,000,less than a third of today'sfigure. During the early partof the century, the elderlynationwide accounted for arelatively small share of thetotalpopulation; Kentuckywas no exception with anelderly percentage of about5.4 in1930. The decadesfollowing 1930 signaled aperiod of rapid populationgrowth for the elderly thatcontinues today. By 1950, elders accounted for 8.0 percent of the state total (or about 235,000persons aged 65 and over) and by 1970 these levels increased to 12.0 percent or 337,000individuals (Figure 2.1). By 1990 there were 465,068 Kentucky residents 65 years of age or older,comprising 12.6 percent of the population of the Commonwealth. One in four Kentuckyhouseholds contained one or more persons 65 or older and over 14 percent of Kentucky'shouseholds contained two or more persons 65 or older.2Several distinctive demographic processes underlie changes in Kentucky's elderly population.First, there is the impact of previous fertility levels. This process is demonstrated by the rapidgrowth in size of the elderly population between 1930 and 1940. During this decade the elderlypopulation increased by over 33 percentan increase that has not been attained in any decadesince that time. Such growth is a direct result of dramatic improvements in health and economiesduring the post-Civil War reconstruction era, which led to high fertility during the 1870s.Another example is the 21.5 percent increase in the size of the elderly population between 1970and 1980, caused by a similar increase in fertility just after World War I.A second process involves the migration of a younger labor force. During the 1960s theCommonwealth's elderly population growth slowed to about 15.4 percent over the decade. Thisslowing coincided, however, with a dramatic increase in the share of the total population definedas elderly, which grew from 9.6 percent in 1960 to just over 12 percent by 1970. Thesecomparative changes were a consequence of Kentucky's depressed coal economy during the1960s, a decade marked by heavy out-migration of the labor force in pursuit of employment inother states and an aging-in-place of the older retired population. An upswing in economicconditions during the 1970s, plus a significant number of Baby Boomers entering the highmobility years of young adulthood, resulted in an influx of labor force migrants to the state,which caused a decline in the percent 65 and over, even though the elderly population wasgrowing quite rapidly.A third processmigration of the elderlyis evident in selected counties throughout thestate. Areas such as Land Between the Lakes and, in more recent decades, Lake Cumberlandhave served as attractive retirement destinations for elderly residents from Kentucky and fromseveral nearby states.3 Migration of the elderly does not act in isolation but is associated withprevious fertility and labor force migration.It is with this context of multiple interacting demographic processes that we must interpretprojections of future changes in Kentucky's elderly population. A period of high fertility 2Bowles, G., Gallaher, C.., Watkins, J., Ilvento, T., and Danner, D. (1996). Kentucky atlas of the elderly (Occasional Publication Num-ber 4).

Growth and Change,24, 509-538.32 Growing Old in Kentucky: The Approaching Age of Age 13 following World War H generated the Baby Boom population, the first members of which will bereaching age 65 in 2010 (Table 2.1). The outcome will be a 31.4 percent increase in the 65 andover population between 1990 and 2010.4 Additional increase between 2010 and 2020 will reflectthe influence of the main body of the baby boom birth cohort which will be reaching 65 duringthis decade. Thus, in the single decade between 2010 and 2020 the population 65 and over isprojected to increase by an additional 29.6 percent (high growth series projection). TABLE 2.1Projected Growth in Kentucky's Elderly Population, Kentucky State Data Center (10/96)In addition to significant increase in the size of the general elderly population there is likelyto be a continuation of change in the age composition of the elderly population, a trend that hasbecome apparent in recent decades. With dramatic increase in life expectancy at birth (almost 30years gained in this century-from 47.3 in 1900 to 75.5 in 1993), persons 75 and over havebecome an increasingly evident component of the elderly population (see Table 2.1). Indeed, thepopulation 85 and over is the fastest growing segment of the population. Projections for Kentuckyindicate that this age group will expand from 45,718 in 1990 (1.2 percent of the population) to86,692 in 2010 (1.7 percent of the population), an increase of 89.6 percent over the two decadeperiod.5 In 1990, 9.8 percent of Kentucky's elderly population was 85 or older. By 2010 this willincrease to 14.2 percent.Growth among Kentucky's \"old old\" population (75 years and older) is not expected toprogress uniformly across the state, and patterns of anticipated change are in some cases quitesurprising. Three area development districts that have experienced the highest contemporaryretirement in-migration, for example, include Purchase, Pennyrile, and Lake Cumberland, yetgrowth in the 75 and over populations of these ADDs is expected to slow by 2010 (Table 2.2).Similar magnitudes of slowing growth are also expected in Barren River and Kentuckiana.Conversely, dramatic acceleration of growth can be anticipated in the Appalachian ADDs of BigSandy and FIVCO, and in Northern Kentucky.Uncertainty in future migration trends will certainly alter current projections of our elderlypopulation, and the relatively small size of the older elderly population will potentially causeforecasts of this segment to experience the greatest deviation from expected levels. Nevertheless,the statistics presented gain significance in that, regardless of the growth scenario used in theprojections, there is no doubt that marked increases will occur in the 75 and over population size.These individuals, and especially those age 85 and over, are the most frail, the most dependent,and the most in need of services. The aging of Kentucky's elderly population is therefore likely tocreate major concerns with respect to service provision and caregiving strategies. Such concernswill be amplified by the recognition that some areas in the state where the pace of growth will behigh may be hardest pressed to provide assistance for their elders. 4 Price, M., Sawyer, T. and Scobie, M.

Indeed theheightened attention during the 1970s given to the conditions and characteristics of the elderlydid much to rectify the misleading stereotypes of growing old. How, then, can we more accuratelydescribe our Commonwealth's elderly population? What are their current life circumstances?How have these characteristics and circumstances changed during the past decade? And whatchanges can we anticipate in the future as this population increases in size? In this section wepresent a brief profile of the current status of Kentucky's elderly population, employing severalkey indicators. (A more detailed profile is available in the recently published Kentucky Atlas ofthe Elderly. Unless otherwise indicated, all figures pertain to persons 65 or over.) The majority ofKentucky's elders are female (60.4 percent, almost identical to the national figure of 59.8percent). Most elderly Kentuckians are white (94.0 percent in comparison with a national figureof 89.3 percent). A very high proportion of Kentucky's elders (44.5 percent) live in rural areas(defined as communities of 2,500 persons or less); this is almost twice the national percentage of24.6 percent. A high proportion of Kentucky's elders live alone (31.0 percent in comparison witha national figure of 28.8 percent). Living alone is even more prevalent among Kentuckians 75and over (38.3 percent). This is consistent with national trends that show that propensity to livealone has increased over the past three decades and that propensity to live alone also increaseswith age.6Turning to objective indicators of well-being, it is apparent that, in comparison with nationalstatistics, Kentucky's elders are subject to a litany of disadvantage. Many of Kentucky's eldershave limited education; 44.6 percent have less than a 9th-grade education in comparison with anational figure of 25.9 percent. Many continue to live on low incomes. In 1989, more than one infive Kentucky elders (20.6 percent) lived on an income below the poverty level, in comparisonwith a national figure of 12.8 percent. For those Kentuckians 75 and over this figure rises to onein four (25.3 percent). In comparison with national figures, Kentucky's elders are also more likely to be without a telephone (5.3 percent versus 2.6 percent), to live in housing lacking 6!Casper, J.D. (1988).Aging alone: Profiles and projections. New York: The Commonwealth Fund Commission on Elderly People Living Alone.34 Growing Old in Kentucky: The Approaching Age of Age 15 complete plumbing (3.1 percent versus .98 percent) and to be without access to a vehicle (26.1percent versus 22.3 percent). Compounding the effects of these objective disadvantages,Kentucky's elders are far more likely to report mobility and/or self care limitations; 37.2 percentof Kentuckians 75 or over report such limitations, in comparison with a national figure of 30.5percent.Individual indices of disadvantage are, by themselves, distressing. However, their effects aremagnified by the situation of multiple jeopardy in which many elderly Kentuckians findthemselves. Far too many of Kentucky's elders live under circumstances where they are alone,and survive on marginal incomes in inferior housing without access to a vehicle and with notelephone.Regional VariationAs was the case with patterns of elderly population growth (presented above), a state-levelperspective paints a very generalized picture. Aggregate statistics obscure major variationsamong substate areas in terms of population characteristics and indices of life circumstancesvariations between an optimistic extreme, with counties that are far better off than the nationalfigure, and those areas where conditions are truly distressing. This variation is revealed in Table2.3, which documents county extremes on a variety of indicators and provides a tally of thenumber of counties falling both below and above the national figure for each index. A clearpattern of regional disparity emerges when the indicators are considered in concert. Majorcontrasts are apparent between rural and urban areas, for example, with rural areas revealingconsiderable disadvantage on many indicators. In addition, there continues to be a strikingcontrast between eastern Kentucky (particularly the western fringe of the Appalachian coalfield)and the remainder of the state. The persistence of disadvantage in this region is revealed byclusters of counties including Breathitt, Clay, Cumberland, Jackson, Knott, Lee, Leslie,Magoffin, Menifee, Monroe, Morgan, Owsley, Perry, Wayne, and Wolfe, which recorddistressing figures on a variety of indices. Knott (2.1 percent) and Owsley (3.7 percent) have thelowest levels of employment among the elderly. Jackson (80.1 percent) and Leslie (78.3 percent)have the highest percentage of elderly residents who have completed less than nine years ofschool. Monroe (44.8 percent) and Wayne (43.8 percent) have the highest levels of povertyamong the elderly in the state. Wolfe (46.2 percent) and Morgan (44.2 percent) have the highestpercentages of elderly householders incurring housing costs greater than 25 percent of theirincome. 35 16Exploring the Frontier of the Future TABLE 2.3Comparative Characteristics of Elderly, 1990IndexUnitedStatespercent TrendsTo what extent do the life circumstances of Kentucky's elders as described repthat have remained consistent over time? As we begin to look to the future, arehope that the disadvantage of our elders in comparison with those elsewhere inlessening? The answers to these questions are mixed. First, the good news. In36resent patternsthere signs ofthe nation iscommon with Growing Old in Kentucky: The Approaching Age of Age 17 national trends, the educational level of Kentucky's elders has improved with each cohort.Improvement is also apparent since the time of the 1980 census in a number of indicators such astelephone ownership and access to transportation. Poverty levels are also dropping for somegroups of elders, particularly males. However, in sharp contrast to these signs of hope are datarevealing that for certain subgroups, particularly elderly women and especially the \"old old,\" thesituation continues to deteriorate and the gap between the most well-off and the least well offcontinues to widen.7 Poverty among elderly women, for example, has increased during the 1980sdespite the fall in general elderly poverty, and the increase is especially noteworthy amongwomen age 75 and over. The percentage of persons age 75 and over living alone has movedupward almost 5.5 percentage points between 1980 and 1990, and this phenomenon also tends tobe acutely associated with women.Looking to the Future: Emerging Trends and Recurrent ConcernsAt this point it is useful to begin considering some of the implications of the demographicprojections presented earlier in this chapter with respect to the degree to which they are likely toresult in, or be paralleled by, changes that will lead to improvement in the life circumstances ofKentucky's elders. What will the next century, an era which some years ago the writer andscientist Isaac Asimov characterized as \"the approaching age of age,\" hold for Kentucky's elders?Allowing ourselves the luxury of speculation, it is helpful to consider some of the ways in whichthe experience of growing old is likely to change in the approaching age of age.First, with increasing longevity, the pathways of aging are likely to become ever more diverseas the limits of physiological capability expand and the health status of the elderly continues toimprove. There is likely to be an increased range between the most and the least capable duringeach phase of old age. Second, ever-increasing diversity within the elderly population will lead toentirely new definitions of what we mean by aging. That this process of redefinition anddifferentiation is already well underway is manifest in the introduction to our lexicon in recentdecades of distinctions between the andeven the \"pre-old\" (55-64). Third, old age will come to be associated with entirely new activities:starting a business, embarking on a second career, volunteerism, giving expression to talents thatremained latent during a traditional working career, such as sculpture, painting, or even politics.Fourth, old age will come to be associated with new roles, some of which, such as becoming acaregiver for aging peers or assuming a greater role in the education of our youth, may becomenormative. As we evolve a new identity for aging, elders are likely to assume roles we have noteven imagined. Indeed, we anticipate witnessing the emergence of an entirely new culture ofaging and the aged; a culture forged to a laige extent by the elderly themselves as they assumenew roles in a postmodern society. Fifth, there will be continuing proliferation of innovativemodels of care for our oldest old, and for those who are less healthy and capable, as we harnessthe power of technology to design living environments in which even the most frail can continueto live with independence and dignity. It is quite conceivable that sophisticated robotics andbenign monitoring systems will become key elements in the lives of the frail elderly. Finally,there are likely to be momentous social changes in the relationship of the elderly to theremainder of society. Not all of these changes will necessarily be positive. There is a danger thatthe separation and alienation of generations will be accentuated as increasing numbers of elderselect to reside in age-segregated environmentsthe Sun Cities, Leisure Worlds, and a plethora ofsmaller retirement communities that are springing up all over the nation, including in Kentucky.In Lexington alone there are three such communities: Richmond Place, Lafayette Place, andMayfair Village. Alternatively, it is conceivable that our society will evolve in a manner thatthreatens the very integrity of the aging experience. As the debate over the intergenerationaldistribution and allocation of resources becomes more acrimonious, as we anguish over the use of 7 Rowles, G., Johanson, H. (1993). Persistent elderly poverty in rural Appalachia. Journal of Applied Gerontology 12, 349-367. 18Exploring the Frontier of the Future life-extending technologies, as we consider the merits of assisted suicide, it is possible that therewill emerge an entirely new and mean-spirited ethos of growing old. Will we evolve a newsociety in which, to paraphrase the now infamous words of former Colorado Governor RichardLamb, the elderly will be encouraged, perhaps even obliged to get out of the way? In sum, in theyears ahead there are likely to be many changes in the pathways by which we grow old. Thesepathways will be navigated by elderly of increasingly diverse characteristics and circumstances,and are likely to lead to an increasing diversity of accumulated personal life experience.As we contemplate this diversity, it is important to remember the human face of growing old.We strongly believe that success in facing the diversity of the new aging will be conditioned bythe degree to which we are able to satisfactorily resolve many of the dilemmas that confront us aswe deal with those of our elders who are frail and vulnerable. We are thinking of more than45,000 Kentuckians over 85 years of age who are alive today, and more than 86,000 who areprojected to be living in the Commonwealth less than 15 years from now. We are thinking ofpeople like Leroy and Cicely who currently survive despite less-than-ideal circumstances. Whilemany of these people remain active and engaged in life, a large number do not. As we havedocumented, far too many Kentuckians still live in poverty, in inferior housing, with limitedaccess to transportation, and in geographical isolation from much-needed services. Thus, it isespecially important to consider what the trends that have been speculated upon will mean for thefuture of Kentucky's elders. Perhaps, even more important, what will we do as Kentuckians toensure that the changes which are most assuredly coming are harnessed as an opportunity toimprove the life circumstances of those of our elders, particularly in certain parts of the state,who are growing old under conditions of severe hardship.Charting Directions in Living With AgeShort of Draconian intervention through euthanasia, we cannot change 'the basicdemographics of aging (for those who will be old have already been born). However, we canchange our responses to them. We can create a Kentucky in which no elder remains poor, lives ininferior housing or is denied access to services he or she needs. We conclude this chapter bysuggesting several broad directions in which we might progress in Kentucky, with respect to howwe might live with an aging population and how we as individuals might live with our ownaging.Assisted living and continuum of care alternatives. The aging process is not clearly markedby discrete and sudden changes. We evolve over time with regard to such factors as physical andemotional strength, and sensory acuity. Because of these gradual and ongoing transitions, wehave ever-changing needs from our immediate living environment. Unfortunately, too fewhomes, either family or institutional, allow the flexibility to meet the changing needs of theelderly. Consequently, recognizing the trend toward ever-increasing diversity in the elderlypopulation, it will be important to progress toward a situation where in every part of theCommonwealth there exist a wide array of living and support options for the elderly (assistedliving options, family care homes, a variety of home care options, etc.). Each of these optionsshould be integrated within a comprehensive system of linked residential options that afford theopportunity to move freely from less to more supportive options (and back again) as individualcircumstances change. Currently, there exist a plethora of innovative residential options thatmight become part of such a continuum but, especially in many rural parts of the state, realchoices are limited for our elders because many of these optiOns are unavailable in individuallocalities.838 8Golant, S. (1992).Housing America's elderly: Many possibilities, few choices. Newbury Park, CA Sage. Growing Old in Kentucky: The Approaching Age of Age 19 Innovative technologies and design solutions. Given that the preference of the elderly to agein place is likely to continue into the new century, a major priority should be placed onembracing innovative technologies and design solutions that make it possible for elders to remainat home and able to live independently for as long as possible. Innovations in robotics (perhapsfacilitated by expansion of the mission of the Center for Robotics at the University of Kentucky),advances in interior design, sophisticated landscape architecture, and even advances in the use ofpharmaceuticals, may be employed to sustain independent living.Overcoming barriers of distance. A major constraint on improving the life circumstances ofelders in Kentucky is the barrier of distance and the remoteness of many elders from services thatis a consequence of the rural character of much of the state. By embracing new forms ofcommunication and communication technology, including distance learning, telemedicine, andother types of non-place-based services, it will be possible to effectively collapse space and enrichthe lives of elders in even the most remote areas of the Commonwealth. Initiatives are alreadyunderway in these areas through the Center for Rural Health at the University of Kentucky. Wecan anticipate that continued expansion of such telecommunication options will become a majorfeature of service restructuring during the next century.Expansion of selected services. While the introduction of new technologies will clearlybecome a major featureservice and care for the frail elderly, it is also important to recognizethe role- of more traditional programs. There is a need for the expansion of rural transportationservices, financial planning services, and home care programs. In addition, we can anticipate thefurther growth of new services and programs which in recent years have become importantfeatures of the social service landscape. Such programs include community-based social supportand respite care programs. We can also anticipate continuing expansion of adult day care (aservice in which the state has played a pioneering role over the past decade) and growth in theimportance of eldercare programs providing information and assistance to family memberscaring for a frail elderly relative. These programs might even involve the creation of care servicebanks through which individuals can gain credit for providing care for an elder in theirneighborhood that can be used in a different part of the state to purchase similar care for theirown relative living in that part of the state.Seeking and encouraging new roles. Finally, perhaps the most important direction we cantake is to invest in the support of elders as they create new roles for themselves as with increasingnumbers they begin to evolve a very different culture of aging than currently exists. Obviously,we cannot predict the directions that this evolutionary process will takewhether it will involvegreater emphasis on volunteerism, the assumption of enhanced family and community caregivingroles, the evolution of a leisure lifestyle separated from the remainder of society, or theassumption of politically powerful roles in mainstream society. What we do know is that thedemographics of an increasingly aged Commonwealth will inevitably lead to emergence of newroles for elders. Moreover, building on the power of numbers, it is likely that future generationsof elders will be less tolerant of the life-circumstance inequities we have described.Hopefully, the outcome of reinforcing these and other strategies will be elevation of the lifecircumstances of all of Kentucky's elders and a reduction of the disparity between those who arebest and worst off. While change will be inevitable, the direction of this change is notpredetermined. Rather it will depend on the will we have to create the kind of environment inwhich all Kentuckians can grow older with dignity, independence, and an appreciation of theinterdependence thatis necessary to maximize quality of their lives. In considering theimplications of change for quality of life, it is important to emphasize that the indicators of lifecircumstance employed throughout this chapter do not necessarily translate directly into \"qualityof life\" or imply any judgments on our part with respect to lifestyle. Quality of life involves far30 20Exploring the Frontier of the Future more than the measures we have discussed. For most elders it entails immersion within asupportive milieu of family, friends, and community, and a socio-cultural context that providesreinforcement for a preferred lifestyle, a sense of personal identity, and an historical involvementwith place. Viewed from this perspective, it is not surprising that the research literature amplyillustrates that objective disadvantage is not necessarily associated with low levels of \"subjective\"well-being or an inferior lifestyle among the elderly.9 While we acknowledge that objectivecircumstances do not necessarily correspond with subjective well-being, adopting a relativedeprivation perspective, we see no reason for this relationship to serve as a justification forinaction.Accepting ResponsibilityWhat kind of place are we creating for our elders? What kind of setting do we want to createfor a generation that will have quite different backgrounds from the current generation? In a veryreal sense it is important to consider the ways in which the next generation of elders will bereformulating the experience of growing old in Kentucky. Growing old in Kentucky will be whatwe choose to make it. We have two choices. One is to perpetuate through inaction the status quo.The outcome of this strategy will be reinforcement of the fragmentation of Kentucky's elderlypopulation into an array of contrasting sub-populations that move progressively farther apartfrom each other in the Balkanization of the aging experienceranging from a group of relativelyaffluent retiree immigrants whom we actively recruit and attract to selected amenity regions ofthe state, to a group of disadvantaged elders in some areas of the state whose status continues todecline as we make only token efforts to alleviate the abysmal circumstances under which theyeke out an existence. While it is important to celebrate diversity, such diversity should be basedon divergent chosen pathways rather than the constraints of disparate life circumstances imposedby an uncaring community. It is important to begin to accept responsibility for our own future sothat by the time we reach retirement the dire circumstances of the Leroys and Cicelys of ourCommonwealth will be but a memory. 40 9 Lee, G., Lassey, M.

Families and Children:The Common Wealth of Kentucky Kentucky families are becoming older, forming at a slower rate than are nonfamily households, andbecoming more diverse than ever before. The preservation of Kentucky families depends on adequate edu-cation of adult members, access to jobs that provide livable wages and benefits, and changes in familyformation. When families are unsuccessful in socializing, nurturing, regulating, and providing for theirmembers, the cost is borne by everyone. Thus, the Commonwealth has an interest in building and main-taining strong families who function successfully. By Stephan M. WilsonUniversity of KentuckyKentucky families, like families throughout the nation, are changing.' Over the last twocenturies, they have become smaller and more diverse, and, on average, they movemore often, have more family members living into old age, enjoy better health, andhave more education and wealth. Today, family life is also informed by greater equality acrossgender, race, and income than was true in the past. In spite of the many changes and improve-ments in the lives of a majority of Kentucky families, some negative aspects of earlier trendscontinue, and new challenges to the least advantaged of Kentucky families and children loom onthe horizon.Early Kentucky families, such as the family of Daniel and Rebecca Boone, experienced longabsences from each other in their marriages and isolation from their extended families, but theyhad a definite notion of the meaning and composition of family. As new generations emerged,social and economic conditions brought about changes in this traditional family unit of two par-ents with children. Small nuclear families that included extended networks of kin with strongties to the land and to each other evolved, characterizations that describe many rural Kentuckyfamilies even at the close of the 20th century. Unlike the gradual changes experienced by earlyKentucky families, contemporary families have experienced relatively rapid and sweepingchanges in family formation, roles within families, and the compositions of households, in re-sponse to social and economic conditions. In spite of the continuing importance of family, depar-tures from traditional concepts mean that law, language, social customs, and lifestyles often donot intersect with a common understanding of \"family.\"For example, the percent of children in Kentucky who live with two parents has declinedfrom 85 percent (1960) to 73 percent (1990).2 Further, Kentucky now has fewer married coupleswith children under age 18 at home than married couples without children living with them. Infact, the number of households with relatives residing together (family) has declined from 88percent (1960) to 74 percent (1990). Today, nonfamily households (i.e., single or unrelatedhouseholders living together) are the fastest growing household type in Kentucky, followed bysingle-parent households. An adult Kentuckian is more likely to live in a \"nonfamily\" householdthan ever before.3 I Ilvento, T., Dyk, P., Garkovich, L., Hansen, G., & Moore, M. B. (1993). Kentucky families in transition. A special reportfrom the University of Kentucky Population Laboratory. Lexington, KY: Author, 1.2 Ilvento, et al.3 Ilvento, et al.41 22'Exploring the Frontier of the FutureTrends Influencing Family Formation and FunctionAs with the nation as a whole, the formation and the function of Kentucky families is beinginfluenced by economic and social trends. For example, fewer Kentuckians marry today than inpast decades. Nationally, both marriage rates and divorce rates are declining. When and if mar-riage does occur, it occurs at older ages. By the 1990s, the age at first marriage had increased to24 years for women and 26 years for men, about three years later. than in the 1960s, a featurereminiscent of decades prior to the 1940s. Changing economics, the increased participation ofwomen in the labor force, and the feminization of higher education are major influences on thedelay of first marriages. In turn, these factors influence the choice to postpone and to have fewerchildren.While Kentucky families share national trends, some features are unique. For example, thenumber of new households has been growing at a faster rate than the addition of new families tothe population. Since 1960, Kentucky's population has increased by 21 percent while householdgrowth has increased by 62 percent. The average household size has decreased by nearly oneperson, from 3.5 (1960) to 2.6 (1990). During the same period, nonfamily households increasedfrom 12 percent to 26 percent of all households. A smaller, but steady increase in the proportionof households headed by single parents has also occurred. Trends unique to Kentucky compelthe design of family policies and programs that are, in many cases, different from those of otherstates with different demographics.As the Commonwealth moves into its third century, the variety of family structures is becom-ing more diverse and less familiar, and a wider range of family types is becoming more com-mon. As a result of social and economic changes and increased diversity, families are beingpressured to fulfill traditional family functions and adapt to new demands. Empowering familiesto meet both these demanding new challenges should become a primary societal concern in theyears ahead.Kentucky Families and ChildrenIncreasingly, society is being called to redefine, support, and complement the functions offamily. A wide array of pressing, family relevant issues, including child and elder care, healthcare, opportunities for postsecondary' education, adequate housing, and youth and adult unem-ployment and underemployment, are gradually rising to the top of the political agenda. In addi-tion, society is being called upon to provide family life education, prevention and treatment fordomestic violence, prevention and treatment for child neglect and abuse, individual and rela-tional counseling, and training for transition to independent living. Society also must protectthose who do not live in traditional family households. This list of responsibilities is not exhaus-tive, but we cannot afford to neglect these and other basic concerns.At the turn of the century, the most pressing concern in Kentucky is arguably poverty, acondition which exacerbates most of the costly societal problems we now confront. Indeed, pov-erty is not solely the burden of impoverished families. Instead, it influences all Kentuckians whopay taxes and share community assets, such as education and health programs. Our collectivefate is inextricably bound to the well-being of individuals and families, and their abilities andwillingness to contribute to the common wealth.Today, our youngest families, particularly those with young children, are the most vulnerableand the most likely to be poor. Data from the Children's Defense Fund reveal that the purchasingpower of families with young children, headed by someone under the age of 30, fell 32 percentbetween 1973 and 1990.4Insufficient economic resources are related to family attempts to carryout protective and nurturing functions. It is, therefore, critical that policies empower families of42 4Children's Defense Fund. (1992). The state of America's children yearbook 1992. Washington, DC: Author. Families and Children: The Common Wealth of Kentucky 23 all ages to attain a sufficiently high standard of living and competence to successfully nurture andeducate their children.The effect of poverty for the 27 percent of Kentucky's children who live below the povertyline goes far beyond merely limiting their choices of food, clothing, and shelter.5 The KentuckyKIDS COUNT Consortium (1995) estimates that about half of the children in Kentucky aremembers of families who live below or barely above the poverty line, and thus are unable toprovide a minimal standard of living. It is not just single-parent families or families on welfarewho are suffering. Many families are finding it increasingly difficult to avoid poverty or eco-nomic marginality regardless of family structure. Across America, more than 5.6 million chil-drenover a third of all poor childrenlive in working poor families.6 Further, between 1989and 1994, a period of overall economic strength in both the national and state economy, thenumber of children in working poor families increased by 30 percent.Our understanding of poverty is obviously critical to our ability to remedy it, but assumptionsabout the causes of poverty often are not grounded in fact. Most children born outside of mar-riage, for example, are born to women over age 25. Although family poverty is related to genderissues and to single-parent households,one half of poor children live in married, Rather than focus on perceived familytwo-parent households where at least one anomalies, we must better prepare citizensparent (usually the father) works year and improve employment opportunities.round.? Thus, family poverty can neitherbe explained nor eliminated by changesin family structure alone. Creating effective policy to train and employ welfare families, for ex-ample, is currently mandated in each state by the federal government. But unless policies workto change economic circumstances for the working poor, moving more Kentucky families intothat category is likely to be counterproductive. Rather than focus on perceived family anomalies,we must better prepare citizens for more self-sufficient lives and improve employment oppor-tunities.What we do assuredly know is that the economic circumstances of families profoundly affecttheir children's lives. When children from economically disadvantaged homes enter school, theyare more likely to lack basic academic skills and to be less ready to learn than their peers frommore affluent families. These educational liabilities are likely to remain with children throughouttheir school careers. Inadequate access to resources and appropriate stimulation for young chil-dren also detracts from their physical and emotional health. It lowers future levels of educationaland occupational attainment, and undercuts preparation for adulthood, including employment,parenthood, and citizenship. Lower performance in these areas leads to higher public expendi-tures for family and individual support, remedial and correctional services, erosion of tax bases,and becomes a threat to our \"economic wealth.\"Early intervention for economically disadvantaged children is a critical public and private in-vestment that can effectively break the cycle of poverty and improve individual and societal out-comes. Children who do well in school are more likely to become economically self-sufficientadults and to be better prepared to make other contributions to family and society. As a follow-upto recent nationally recognized educational initiatives in public school, Kentucky is in a uniqueposition to mandate policy and programs for all preschoolers, regardless of the economic situa-tion of parents, and to provide educational, health and remedial assistance that will help ensuretheir readiness. If all Kentucky families were able to send their children to school ready to learn,the Commonwealth would enjoy substantial direct and indirect benefits. Fewer families and chil-dren would live in poverty and, over the long term, the enormous cost of mitigating the outcomesof poverty would be greatly diminished. 5 Kentucky KIDS COUNT Consortium.

(1996). 43 24Exploring the Frontier of the FutureFactors Related to Family POvertyBeyond the overrepresentation of particular gender, race, and location of family poverty, sev-eral factors help predict which families are most likely to experience poverty. For example, thepersistence of teen single parenthood, particularly among young African-Americans, is a coun-terpoint to the increase in age at first marriage among the general population and the decrease inthe number of children born to married couples in their 20s and 30s. The highest rates of povertyoccur among those with the highest rates of teen and unmarried parenthood.A strong and persistent relationship also exists between single parenthood and family poverty,whether the parent union dissolves before or after children are born and whether the parents wereever married or are divorced. Single parents and their children are more likely to experience pov-erty and subsequent reliance on welfare. Although many single-parent families are strong, a dis-proportionatepercentage experienceAlthough many single-parent families are serious problems compared to two-strong, a disproportionate percentage Parent families. In addition to its rela-tionship to child poverty, single par- experience serious problems compared to entingisassociatedwithlower two-parent families. educational attainment, poorer mentaland physical health, higher rates ofteen pregnancy, lower rates of high school completion, and other problems that compromisechild, adolescent and family well-being. Future policy must address the rate of single parenthood,as well support better outcomes for the substantial number of single parents and their children.The age at first parenthood is a strong predictor of economic well-being for families withchildren. Young parents, particularly unwed mothers, are likely to have insufficient educationand experience to make a successful transition to independent adult life, that does not requiregovernment transfer payments and assistance from their parents and other family members. Thecosts of young single parenthood are borne not only by the young parents (mothers in particular),but by their children, their parents, and all taxpaying citizens. In response, policies and programsto prevent adolescent pregnancy must be targeted at both sexes and families of origin, and in-volve communities, as well as schools. At present, most Kentucky programs involve adolescentgirls, sometimes their children, and schools. More community involvement, better preventiveeducation for males and females, more access and new policy directions, more accountability anderadication of child poverty (i.e., for mother and baby) are challenges for the end of this centuryand into the next.Many also point to divorce rates as a contributing factor in rising inequalities. The divorcerate in Kentucky is considerably above the U.S. average, while child support collection is belowthe national average. Today, as has been true since 1960, custody of about 9 out of 10 children ofdivorce is awarded to the mother.8 From an economic standpoint, this automatically places chil-dren at a disadvantage. They are further disadvantaged in Kentucky, which ranks 40th in thenation in regard to economic gender equality indicators. According to the Center for Businessand Economic Research at the University of Kentucky, the median income for women with 15years or more of employment is only 57.1 percent of men with comparable job tenure.African-American Kentuckians face disproportionate economic disadvantages and limitedaccess to many kinds of opportunities, as well as prejudice. Such hardships sometimes over-whelm family resources and contribute heavily to family disruptions. In 1990, 35 percent of Af-rican-American children lived in married couple families, compared to 76 percent of otherKentucky children.' African-American children were twice as likely to be poor. Because higherproportions of African-American families have moved to and are concentrated in urban areas,policy and programs dedicated to improving well-being are of special concern to municipalities. Weitzman, Families and Children: The Common Wealth of Kentucky 25 In rural areas, inclusiveness is key because smaller proportions of minorities may make theirspecial needs less apparent to policymakers and public service personnel.Kentucky's legal system also continues to struggle to resolve economic inequities betweendivorced parents. However, court-ordered collections of child support payments succeeded inonly 14 percent of Kentucky cases.\") The development of a less adversarial system that fostersthe involvement of noncustodial parents in their children's lives could not only yield financialbenefits for children, but social and emotional ones as well. At present, legal processes too oftenreward the aggressive self-interest of parents with little regard for the real and comprehensiveneeds of children. Policy is urgently needed to place trained family professionals in the roles ofmediators before coercive and invasive court interventions take place. By contrast, judges, law-yers and clinicians often presume that divorcing families are already \"broken\" and effectivelyexacerbate negative outcomes in the lives of children.Special PopulationsStep Families. The United States has the highest remarriage rate in the world. It is estimatedthat more than 40 percent of all marriages in the United States today are remarriages for at leastone of the spouses, and most of these remarriages involve children. This has produced an esti-mated 2.3 million step family households. Given the growing population of step families, it isincreasingly important to clarify the legal status of step parents in Kentucky. Step families gen-erally involve three or more parents who usually do not share consensus about parental rights,responsibilities, and privileges. As a consequence, the role of step parents remains ambiguous.Parental legal rights concerning their step children are very limited, yet society expects them tofunction as responsible and effective parents to their step children. It is urgent that services forstep families be expanded and laws be made more sensitive to and supportive of this growingfamily form. However, it is also crucial that policies support and balance the rights of noncusto-dial parents to help them remain a meaningful part of their children's social and emotionallives, as well as in their roles as financially responsible contributors.Older Adult Families. While some groups of Kentuckians aged 65 and older have experi-enced improvement in overall economic well-being, the lives of other elders are increasinglyeconomically compromised. Because of limited lifelong job and economic opportunities, manyolder Kentuckians live their later years at or below the poverty level.\" In an ironic twist, thosewho have been denied education and good jobs are further denied financial equity in their oldage, largely because they had less opportunity in their lives. Poverty among the elderly hasnegative effects on health, residential independence, well-being, and general quality of life forboth individuals and their families.Women, minorities, and those residing in central cities or the most remote rural areas aremore likely to experience poverty in their later years. According the 1990 U.S. Census, African-American elderly are more likely to live in poverty (35 percent) than are nonminority elderly (20percent). Poverty in rural eastern Kentucky counties has risen dramatically, particularly for veryold Appalachian women. In one in three rural counties in eastern Kentucky, more than 40 per-cent of women who are 75 years or older live in poverty. In five of these counties, very oldwomen experienced poverty rates over 50 percent.' 2Many poor elderly are unable to pay for the necessities of independent living, medical care,prescription medicine, or long-term care. Elders who have difficulty maintaining their inde-pendence often must rely on informal supports, mainly family, to provide assistance. There are, 10 Kentucky KIDS COUNT Consortium. (1992).

Further, those elders with the highestrisks for poverty are most often members of families who themselves have the fewest materialresources. Although services can be targeted to urban elderly poor with relative efficiency, serv-ices to isolated rural, poor elders remain of great concern. The challenge for Kentucky is to re-lieve the poverty of the elderly in family sensitive ways and to provide more resources and awide variety of innovative programs for all of the elderly. As the population ages and more in-dividuals survive longer, poverty among the elderly will demand increasing attention to preven-tion and relief for at-risk elderly and their families.Rural and Urban Families. While rural and urban Kentucky families share common probJlems, they also face unique circumstances. For example, rural families are more likely to be mar-ried couple families with children (42.3 percent, compared to 34.6 percent of urban families) andare less likely to be single parent families (7.7 percent compared to 13.5 percent in urban areas).However, rural families are more likely to live in poverty and enjoy access to fewer and less ade-quate services, including education, physical and mental health systems, transportation and pub-lic assistance.On the other hand, urban families often do not enjoy the informal services and social supportsavailable to many rural families. Rural families tend to help each other across generations, partlybecause rural families are more likely to live near several households of extended family andlifelong friends and to have daily contact with them. Rural Kentuckians have a heritage of strongfamily bonds and residential constancy which promotes strong loyalty to a locale and to eachother. Familism, in which the survival and well-being of family is placed above individual con-cerns, ensures that everyone will have greater access to pooled resources, including intra-familyservices, in times of need, but also demands greater obligations from each family member. Fa-milism provides both an incentive and an obligation to remain tied to a place and a particulargroup of people, and discourages individuals from leaving their home area for potential individ-ual gain. Residential constancy is most encouraged in geographic areas where economic oppor-tunities are likely to be stagnant or diminishing.Appalachian Families. Appalachian families are particularly known for familism, strongloyalties to religious and artistic orientations, and to family land. Over the last half century,many Kentucky mountain counties have experienced a massive exodus of residents in search ofeconomic survival. Often these same counties do not have sufficiently strong or diversified eco-nomic development to support the families who stay. Appalachian families who remain oftensuffer economic hardships; however, families who leave suffer the consequences of being sepa-rated from the people and places they most value. Out-migrants often have higher levels of edu-cation and job skills than those who remain. Some have argued that Appalachian Kentucky is akind of \"third world within the United States\"furnishing cheap labor and raw materials foreconomic interests outside the region. In a situation similar to the \"brain drain\" faced by thirdworld countries, Appalachian families and children will face increasing problems if the pool ofhuman and material resources in their home communities continues to be depleted.13Kentucky Families and Child CareGaps in adequate care for the children of working parents present a significant public policychallenge. In 1991, 67 percent of U.S. mothers with children under 18 and 53 percent of womenwith an infant younger than one year old were in the labor force,14 creating an estimated overalldemand for child care for 11.6 million children. Nationally, an estimated five million child care 13 Wilson, S.M. (1994). Rural and Appalachian youth and their families. In P.C. McKenry, S.M. Gavazzi (Eds.), Vision 2010:Families & MN: National Council on Family Relations.14 Children's Defense Fund. (1992). The state of America's children yearbook 1992. Washington, DC: Author. Families and Children: The Common Wealth of Kentucky 27 slots were available for children in licensed centers and regulated family day care homes in1991. Thus, 6.6 million children were in unlicensed or in nonregulated care. And, even if childcare is available to parents, it is not always affordable. In Kentucky, subsidy programs for childcare services have been so limited that the Department of Social Services has been forced to stopadding names to the 10,000 children already on its child care waiting list.Further, even if parents can find child care and can afford to pay for it, the quality of avail-able child care is often an issue of concern. Child care fees in the South, including Kentucky, arethe lowest in the United States, with the average fees for center, regulated family day care andnonregulated family day care being $1.29 per hour, $1.32 per hour, and $0.89 per hour respec-tively. These low fees index the low wages for child care providers and indicate the basis for thegeneral lack of professionalization and career commitment among child care workers. The aver-age annual salary for a preschool teacher nationally is approximately $11,500. Teachers with acollege degree have opportunities for more lucrative employment, which contributes to the highturnover rate (about 40 percent per year) in child care settings. However, the well-being of in-fants and preschoolers is being advanced most in child care settings with the same professionalteachers and well-trained child care workers. Quality programming is also related to group sizeand child/staff ratios, but Kentucky's current regulations do not meet recommended standardsfor either. Ironically, recent polling suggests that the Kentucky general public believes lowerchild/staff ratios should be set and subsidized by the state.I5The inadequacies of today's system are likely to worsen in the absence of concerted attentionand expanded investment. About 60 percent of all Kentucky mothers of children younger thansix are in the workforce, a trend expected to continue into the next century. More than 154,000Kentucky children under the age of six already have mothers in the workforce. While the conse-quences of welfare reform are not yet known, it is likely to flood an already strained child caresystem with demands for affordable, available, and high quality care for our most vulnerablecitizens that will permit mothers to work. Scholars and practitioners agree that young childrenrequire the best-educated caregivers and lowest ratio of staff to children because of their manydevelopmental needs. If child care workers, professional staff, and adequate building environ-ments are to be provided for the growing needs of Kentucky preschool children, funding initia-tives, worker education, and the establishment of child care facilities must be undertakenimmediately.Promoting Prosperous FamiliesOne mechanism for dealing with economic disadvantage is to empower those who are inpoverty to break free. Empowerment occurs when opportunities are created for the display ofcompetence, and families develop the ability to meet their own needs and aspirations in waysthat promote control over their own family functioning. Fairly typically, families experiencingchronic poverty do not have control over their lives because of minimal levels of education, lackof adequate employment, fear of risk taking, and having too many children at relatively youngages. Empowerment of families, as a way to promote prosperity, may be best accomplished bymaking resources available for adequate education, job training and employment. In spite of theobvious costs of these efforts, failure to provide needed resources has a \"pay-now-or-pay-later\"consequence. Families in poverty are more likely to have children who have poor school per-formance, who experience chaos in many parts of their adult lives, increased risk for disruptedschooling and inadequate job attainment, early pregnancy, family instability, difficulties with thelaw, dependency on public assistance, and disappointing personal relationships. 15 Townley, K., Wilson, S.M.

Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky Research Center for Families and Children.4 7 28Exploring the Frontier of the Future If family prosperity, in all meanings of the word, is to occur, public programs and privateefforts must inspire new visions of family empowerment and full participation in citizenship.Such efforts must furnish appropriate means for establishing stable family life, developing par-enting skills, involvement in their own and their children's education, community participation,successful employment, and a sense of control and self-direction. Education and training of dis-advantaged individuals and families are not enough to strengthen families or to improve thequality of life in Kentucky households. For Although welfare reform may be an many families, quality of life includes opportunity for the Commonwealth to wanting and needing to remain in theirset policy and funding goals which can current communities. Essential elements ofempower families who now depend on creating prosperity in Kentucky familiespublic programs, a larger and more are the attraction or creation of value-added businesses that offer livable wages, troubling need for adequate policy and the use of natural and human resources funding is the plight of the working poor. from the area (e.g., value added industrysuch as furniture manufacturing ratherthan exporting logs), and the creation, implementation, and wide dissemination of professionalfamily life education programs, as well as family support services that make employment possi-ble, such as elder care, child care, and family friendly work environments. Families prosperwhen they are given adequate access to appropriate resources, and are encouraged to meet theirown needs in a competent and independent manner.Examination of disadvantaged families in Kentucky leads to the conclusion that poverty un-derlies most problems, and that the root cause of most poverty is attributable to problems in eco-nomic and educational access, and family functioning. Given the facts reviewed in this chapter,it is unrealistic to think that taking away welfare, or forcing people to work at minimum wageswill create prosperity for disadvantaged Kentucky families. Although welfare reform may be anopportunity for the Commonwealth to set policy and funding goals which can empower familieswho now depend on public programs, a larger and more troubling need for adequate policy andfunding is the plight of the working poor.The trends and emerging realities outlined in this chapter are likely to continue into the earlydecades of the next century. There is no \"quick fix.\" Constructive, courageous, and informed,public policy decisions will be required to move disadvantaged families toward empowermentand self-sufficiency.Future of Kentucky FamiliesIn the coming decades the proportion of nontraditional family structures will continue to in-crease in Kentucky, and these different family forms will require specific kinds of public atten-tion. The \"traditional family\" with an intact first marriage for both spouses, a working fatherand a stay-at-home mother, and several young children is rapidly becoming a phenomenon ofthe past. Today, only a very small minority of American households include such families. Thechanging profile of families requires that long-range strategies to assist Kentucky families firstacknowledge and then plan public policy which accurately reflects who we are and who we arebecoming.It is also likely that the proportion of children in the population and the number of childrenper family will continue to decline, while the number of couples who choose to remain child-freewill likely continue to increase. The number of households without children and without rela-tives is also likely to continue increasing. Among nonfamily households, many will continue toprovide family-like functions for each other, without protection of benefits such as health insur-ance, death benefits, tax breaks, inheritance, and family leave. Policy planners must carefullyconsider how legal protection may contribute to further erosion of unique family prerogatives48 Families andChildren: The Common Wealth of Kentucky29 against how such protection may relieve the state from responsibilities for public assistance forhealth, education, housing, welfare, etc.Family viability, the capacity of families to remain together and to be able to support them-selves in place over time, must become a focus for policymakers. Such a measure is sensitive toeducation, availability of quality jobs, health, crime, marriage and divorce, migration, birth andmortality, cost of living, public assistance, and the proportion of nonmarried households. Giventhe rural and Appalachian ties to the land and to particular small communities that characterizeso many Kentucky families, family viability is an important consideration for the creation offamily and child supportive policies.Areas of Need for ResearchAlthough it is important to conduct targeted research that examines family issues such asdomestic violence, transitions to self-sufficiency and special needs families, it is crucial that fam-ily research not be simply about \"problems.\" It must also contribute to understanding familystrengths, diversity, normative processes, and success. Policy must move beyond trying to addressdeficiencies. Prevention and intervention have their place, but family policy must be proactiveand promote family well-being. Such policy requires thorough, honest, and well-balanced under-standing of Kentucky families as they really are. Research is needed:To establish effective means of lifting and keeping people out of povertyOn the efficacy and costs of programs and how these support goals such as familyempowermentOn the long-term costs of providing and of not providing family supports (i.e., tothese families and to the state)About internal family processes, as well as the interface between families and societyAbout the dynamics and means of family successSuch research can provide the basis for more successful programs for all families and children topromote individual and family dignity and ultimately to decrease human and fiscal costs.Areas of Need for Public PolicyGiven the intricate and often myriad influences on families and the multiple demands on di-verse families, the formulation of family policy is complicated and difficult. However, many op-portunities exist to promote healthy families and children by addressing well understood andwell documented problems and possibilities. While additional research is needed, clear andcompelling areas for public policy initiatives related to Kentucky families and children include:Prevention efforts for prenatal care, early childhood health, development, and en-richment for families with children who are at most riskMore effective child support payment systems, as well as mechanisms to keep non-custodial parents socially and emotionally involved in the lives of their childrenPrograms which decrease the likelihood of family homelessnessPrograms which decrease separation, divorce, or post divorce conflictAggressive programs to discourage teens from becoming parentsPrograms for teens that include effective family life education, pregnancy preven-tion, educational advancement, and career developmentPrograms for teen parents, including family life education, educational continua-tion, and career planning49 30Exploring the Frontier of the Future Family life education by qualified professionals, including premarital education andcounseling, marriage enrichment, parent education, intergenerational family rela-tions, sexuality education, marriage and family therapy, and divorce mediationSupport services to ease transitions and increase marriage and family survival ratesWelfare reforms that emphasize family empowerment, support, preservation, andindependenceAccess to resources that assist families to stay together in placePolicy impact statements that evaluate how policies may influence family viabilityPrograms and research that emphasize family strengthsFamily policies that build on the strengths and the uniqueness of diverse Kentuckyfamilies, ethnicities, structures, and values 50 Poverty in Kentucky The general poverty rates in Kentucky have increased. This increase appears to be driven by bothhigher poverty rates among younger working-age adults with children and by greater numbers of female-headed households with children. While poverty among the elderly declined over the 1979-1989 decade,elderly women, who have limited access to pensions and social security, continued to experience high ratesof poverty. The driving forces behind Kentucky's poverty can be broken down into several categories: lifecycle category, social composition factors, and regional economic factors, each of which offers its ownpossibilities for policy intervention. By Miriam Fordham and Dan JacovitchLegislative Research CommissionAccording to the most recent figures from the Bureau of the Census, 14.7 percent ofKentuckians were living in poverty in 1995. The key question addressed in this chapteris whether there have been significant changes in the level and distribution of poverty inKentucky. The chapter starts with a discussion of the measures of poverty which are judged mostreliable in identifying changing trends. Next is an overview of changes in poverty in Kentuckycompared to the nation as a whole. Then a comparison between groups of Kentucky countiesclassified by population growth or decline highlights any differences over time. Finally, thechapter presents information regarding changes in the poverty status of specific segments ofKentucky's population.Measures of Change in PovertyA necessary first step in evaluating trends in poverty in the state is to determine whichmeasures of poverty present a reliable measure of change. As noted above, the Bureau of theCensus estimated that Kentucky's poverty rate in 1995 was 14.7 percent. Fifteen other states hadpoverty rate estimates greater than Kentucky's. However, one can only say with confidence thatKentucky had a lower poverty rate than five states; South Carolina, Louisiana, Alabama,Mississippi, and New Mexico had rates ranging from 19.9 percent to 25.3 percent. Although theother 10 states had higher point estimates on their poverty rates than Kentucky in the March1996 Current Population Survey (CPS), the relatively small sample (nearly 700 households inKentucky) used to estimate annual poverty rates between census years means that state-levelannual estimates carry margins of error in the range of 1 to 2 percentage points above and belowthe point estimate.The same limitation of the survey sample holds true for measuring change over time. Toalleviate some of the problems related to small sample size, the Bureau of the Census combinesannual data into multiyear averages. In their latest release of state-level annual poverty rates, theBureau provided the average for 1994-1995 and the average for 1993-1994. Kentucky registereda 2.9 percentage point decline between the two-year averages. The two-year moving averageincreased in 19 states, showed no change in one state, and decreased in 30 states. However, evenwith multiyear averages, when the margin of error is recognized, only 10 states had statisticallysignificant changes (nine decreased and one increased) in the two-year moving average povertyrates. Kentucky's 2.9 percentage point decline was statistically significant; only two statesregistered greater declinesMissouri and Louisiana.The statistically significant decline of Kentucky's poverty rate is welcome news; however, notmuch more can be saidthe sample size does not allow one to accurately measure changes in the 51_ 32Exploring the Frontier of the Future substate geographic distribution of poverty or detailed characteristics of those in poverty. Also,statistically significant changes in CPS measurement of state-level poverty rates are the exceptionrather than the rule. In the prior year's CPS (March 1995), only three states had statisticallysignificant changes between the two-year averagesKentucky was not one of them. Kentucky'sstandard error for annual poverty rates, as measured by the CPS, consistently runs around 2percentage points each year. This means that if a survey measures a poverty rate of 18 percent,there is a 90 percent probability that the rate is somewhere between 16 percent and 20 percent.The problem in measuring poverty in nondecennial census years is clear: a real change in thepoverty rate of 1 percentage point is a significant occurrence and yet it is well below thethreshold of current sampling accuracy.Given the limitations of state-level measures of poverty in noncensus years, clearunderstanding regarding changes in Kentucky's poverty situation are only achievable throughnew uses of older decennial census information. This paper makes significant use of two pieces ofinformation from the 1980 census and the 1990 censuscounty-level poverty data and Public UseMicrodata Samples (PUMS), which will be described later.Changes in Poverty in Kentucky and the United StatesTable 4.1 provides the 1990 census poverty rates and numbers (based on 1989 income) forchildren (related children under 18), elderly (persons of age 65 or older), and all others, as wellas for female-headed families with no spouse present with and without children, and all otherfamilies. In addition to the 1989 poverty rates, this table provides the change from the 1980census (based on 1979 income) in both quantity and percent, as well as comparable figures forthe United States.The figures for children and elderly are interesting to compare. Note that between 1979 and1989 the poverty rate for children in Kentucky increased 2.8 percent, to 24.5 percent, while forthe elderly it declined 2.7 percent, to 20.6 percent. However, this does not mean that there weremore children and fewer elderly in poverty. Quite the opposite was true: 292 fewer children and358 more elderly lived in poverty (although for practical purposes, one could say these numberswere \"flat\" representing a change of less than 0.5 percent). The real change in both age groupsoccurred in those above poverty. There was a 14.9 percent decrease in the number of childrenabove poverty and a 17.6 percent increase in the number of elderly above poverty. The samerelative differences between those in poverty and those above poverty apply at the national levelalthough the national figures reflect an overall growth in the population whereas Kentucky'spopulation experienced no appreciable growth between 1980 and 1990.In particular, among all states, Kentucky had the third largest percent decline (11.9 percent)between 1980 and 1990 in the total number of children under 18. Only Iowa and West Virginiahad greater declines, 13.1 percent and 20.7 percent respectively. The nation overall had a 0.3percent decline in the number of children over the same period. The observed loss of children at amuch greater rate for those above poverty could be due to any one, or a mix, of several factorsgreater out-migration of those above poverty, lower birth rates for those above poverty pairedwith natural loss due to aging, or movement to below poverty status for those who werepreviously above poverty. Without data that allows the tracking of individuals over time,definitive statements are not possible.The significantly higher growth rate of elderly above poverty is clearly due to an agingpopulation paired with government financial aid for the elderly. The numbers may also reflectgreater longevity for the elderly not living in poverty, as opposed to those who do live in poverty. 52 53TABLE 4.1Poverty in Kentucky and the United States,1979-1989KentuckyPoverty RateNumber ABOVE adults)Families With Related adults)Families With Related SpouseOther (mostly married couple)12.8%-2.0%17.9%1.9%11.2%0.9% 42.3%1.9%7.9%0.4%3,780,585198,8565.6%11,161,8361,136,21311.3%16,800,4433,015,21521.9% 2,866,941644,50229.0%2,125,904133,6666.7%25,782,0625,209.42725.3%51,116,819(1,511,694)-2.9%133,336,11413,084,07610.9% 3,916,214629,33819.1%24,627,601175,2140.7%Source: U.S. Census Bureau 54 34'Exploring the Frontier of the Future In Table 4.1, the \"other persons\" category, mostly working-age adults, makes up the majorityof those in poverty. Although children have a higher poverty rate and experienced a greaterpercentage point increase in their poverty rate, working-age adults experienced an 18.2 percentincrease in the number below poverty, while the number of poor children and elderly wasbasically unchanged between the two years.The remaining information in Table 4.1 provides changes in poverty status for families withrelated children under 18. The two main categories presented here are female-headed familieswith no husband present and other families (married couple and male-headed with no wifepresent)) As one would expect, female-headed families with children but with no husbandpresent had the highest poverty rate (51.8 percent); this type of family also had the highestpercentage point increase (5.9 points). The percentage growth in the number below poverty wasalso the greatest (38.4 percent) for this type of family.Again note that the number of families with children below poverty increased by 14,300 forfemale-headed families and 1,263 for other families, while the number of children in povertydropped by 292. This indicates a significant change in the composition of poor families withchildren in Kentucky between 1979 and 1989. They must, on average, have fewer children, and agreater percentage are female-headed with no husband present. Relative to the United Stateshowever, Kentucky families in poverty have fewer female householders with no husband present.So, between 1979 and 1989, Kentucky experienced similarly high increases in numbers offemale-headed families below poverty with no husband present (38.4 percent) as the UnitedStates (29.0 percent), but because Kentucky is generally a poorer state relative to the nationalaverage, other families compose a greater share of families in poverty both in real terms andrelative to the nation.The substantial decline (-8.9 percent) in the number of other families with children who hadincomes above poverty is noteworthy. An offsetting increase of other families without children(not shown here) also occurred. These changes are likely due to a mix of factors, including lessfamily creation, dissolution of families, postponement of childbearing, and, possibly, somemovement from above poverty to below poverty classification due to changing economiccircumstances. Again, without data which tracks individuals over time, it is not possible todetermine which factors best account for these developments.Changes within KentuckyTable 4.2 is based on county-level poverty information for 1979 and 1989, extracted from theUSA Counties 1994 CD-ROM. Table 4.2 presents similar information to Table 4.1, but ratherthan comparing Kentucky to the United States, the comparison is between totals for the 65Kentucky counties that experienced a decline in population between the two decennial censusyears and the 55 counties that had population growth. The CD-ROM did not provide county-levelinformation about families with children; therefore, that information is not provided in Table 4.2.The 55 growing counties as a group experienced lower poverty rates and substantially lowerincreases in those rates between 1979 and 1989 for the nonelderly (children and other persons).The 65 shrinking counties as a group experienced substantially greater percent declines in thetwo nonelderly groups above poverty compared to those below povertya 22.2 percent decline inthe number of children above poverty versus a 2.8 percent decline in the number below poverty.The significant growth rate differentials between those above and those below poverty led to thegreater increases in poverty rates. So, for the shrinking counties, a portion of the nonelderlyabove poverty are either moving away or falling into poverty.For the elderly, the level of poverty rates or the change in poverty rates did not differ as muchbetween the two groups of counties. Additionally, for those counties experiencing population loss,the elderly are the only component of the population with a net increase in numbers, with all of For the purposes of this section, \"children\" are defined as those under age 18 who are related to the householder. Childrenrelated to the householder can include any child related by blood or marriage to the householder. Poverty in Kentucky35 the increase coming in the above poverty category. These two factors indicate reduced mobilityfor the elderly while the nonelderly are more likely to move. TABLE 4.2Poverty in Kentucky Counties with Declining and Growing Populations, 1979-198965 Counties with Declining PopulationsPoverty RateNumber BELOW Poverty Number (working-age adults)20.0%-2.9%20.1%1.8%13.4%0.8%41,5941,1032.7%95,5253,5653.9%148,73822,85018.2%165,96929,88422.0%379,299(30,501)-7.4%965,09287,2569.9%Source: U.S. Census BureauFor those counties experiencing population growth, a drop of 7.4 percent in the number ofchildren above poverty and a 3.9 percent increase in the number below poverty still occurred,with a net decline of about 27,000 children. This is remarkable in that the number of adults(elderly and nonelderly combined). increased significantly (141,000.) Together, these figuresstrongly indicate lower birth rates.Similar, analysis differentiating between high- and low-population density counties (notshown) yielded slightly different results. The counties with the higher population density in 1989had lower poverty rates than, but about the same changes in those rates as, those with lowerpopulation density. The most noteworthy difference in the population density breakout was thedifferentiation for the elderly. Grouped by population growth, the poverty rate for the elderlydiffered slightly; however, when grouped by population density, the poverty rate for the elderlywas much higher in the low-density areas. This indicates that, although the elderly may not bewell represented among those who move into and out of areas of growth or decline, their well-being is somewhat related to the area in which they live, as measured by population density.Those in less dense or less developed areas are more likely to be poor, just like those in otherdemographic groups.Changes in Detailed Characteristics of the Poor in KentuckyAll of the previously presented information relied on standardized summary tabulations asreleased by the Bureau of the Census. Certain detailed cross-tabulations are not released becauseof the Bureau's limited resources. To allow researchers to circumvent this limitation, the Bureaureleases the actual census questionnaire responses of all persons living in a 5 percent randomsample of households (addresses and names are withheld to protect confidentiality). This PublicUse Microdata Sample (PUMS) allows researchers to formulate their own tabulations in order toanswer questions which cannot be addressed with the standard set of summary tabulations. Table4.3 (on page 38) provides tabulations from the 1990 PUMS along with changes from the 1980PUMS. Note that because PUMS is a sample, all information in Table 4.3 is subject to someerror. However, the large size of the sample (185,000 individuals) allows for analysis of fairlydetailed segments of the population. The table is composed of three sections running horizontally56 36Exploring the Frontier of the Future across the page and representing, from left to right, three major groups of Kentuckians: adults inhouseholds with children, children alone, and the elderly?When examining the poverty status of detailed segments of a group, it is important toconsider both the frequency and magnitude of poverty for each segment relative to others. Thiscan best be accomplished through simultaneous examination of two measurespoverty rate andshare of poverty. The poverty rate represents the frequency of the occurrence of poverty withinthe population segment; it is a measure of how prevalent poverty is among the people within thesegment. The share of poverty indicates the magnitude of poverty for a given segment relative toother segments; it is the share of all poor that is composed of that particular segment of thepopulation. Table 4.3 provides the poverty rate and share of poverty for 1989, along with thechanges from 1979, for detailed segments within each of the three major population groups underreview.An example of the different kinds of information provided by analyzing both the rate andshare of poverty for various population groups can be seen in examining the relationship betweenrace and poverty in Kentucky. Note in the left columns that the 1989 poverty rate for black adultsin households with children (29 percent) was nearly double the rate for the white adults in thesame category (16 percent). However, black adults accounted for only about 11 percent of all pooradults in households with children because blacks comprise a relatively small portion (7 percent)of the Kentucky population. The fact that black adults account for a larger share of those in thesubgroup in poverty than they do of the entire population shows that they are overrepresentedamong the poor.Adults with Children in PovertyChildhood poverty continues to be an area of focus for public policy proposals. The increasingpercentage of children in poverty raises concerns about future economic opportunities forKentucky and the future fiscal impact on the state. Keeping all other factors constant, an increasein poverty in the state tends to decrease the amount of revenues received by state and localgovernments while increasing their expenditures. However, children are not the only focus ofpolicy concern. Children are not poor by their own design, but rather because the adultsresponsible for their care cannot, or do not, provide a sufficient income to raise themselves andtheir children out of poverty. Therefore, in order to come to a fuller understanding of the causesof poverty among children, it is necessary to examine the characteristics of the adults responsiblefor their care.One change among adults with children in poverty was in the distribution of poverty by agesegment. Between 1979 and 1989, the two segments of older working-age adults with children(36 to 65) experienced little change in poverty rate while the two segments of younger working-age adults with children (19 to 35) experienced significant increases. The share of poor adultswith children comprised of those in the 26 to 45 age segment increased while the sharescomprised of those both older (46+) and younger (19-25) decreased. The aging of the Baby Boomgeneration likely accounts for this increased share, as it accounts for such a large share of thepopulation in general.Tabulations regarding household size, number of persons in the household, and number ofassociated children indicate a significant decline in the share of poverty represented by large 2 Poverty status as calculated here is identical for all individuals in the same household and is based on household income. Thisdiffers from the traditional census measure reported thus far where the calculation of an individual's poverty rate depends onwhether the person is related to the head of the household (householder). Individuals related to the householder who are under18 or are the spouse of the householder all share the same poverty rate based on the family's income; people 15 years or olderwho are not related to the householder, or are the householder of a nonfamily household have individual poverty rates based onindividual income; finally, poverty status is not measured for children under 15 who are not related to the householder. In thismethod, the census is assuming that children under 15 not related to the householder may not have access to the householder'sincome so their poverty status should not be measured. For purposes hem, the desire was to exclude the least number of childrenfrom poverty status measurement. Poverty in Kentucky37 families with many children. These larger families have the highest poverty rates (which is notsurprising given that poverty status is determined partly by household size) as well as the greatestincreases in those rates, but their share of poverty is declining. This drop in share is likely due toa general reduction in family size and an increased incidence of poor, single-parent families.These are likely to be smaller because of the absence of additional adults and because thehousehold heads are likely to be younger and, therefore, have fewer children.Families with two parents present may be better able to survive economically during adownturn in the economy, or anytime for that matter, because they have the potential for twowage earners in the family. Also, average earnings of female-headed families with one wageearner is only 64 percent of those of married couple families with one wage earner and 31 percentof those of married couple families with two wage earners (and 72 percent of those of male-headed families with one wage earner, although very few of these exist.)3 Not surprisingly then,adults in female-headed households with children had the highest poverty rate (42.2 percent)among all family types in 1989. This was up 3 percentage points from 1979. Adults with childrenin married couple families still accounted for the largest share (63.1 percent) of all poor families,but that share was nearly 7 percentage points lower than in 1979, while the poverty rate for thegroup was essentially unchanged. This means that married couple families made up a smallershare of all families. Conversely, female-headed households with children increased as a share ofall families, but particularly, as a share of poor families.The tabulation of marital status further outlines the changing characteristics of households inpoverty. Those adults in households who have children and who are divorced, separated, or nevermarried had the highest poverty rates, experienced the greatest increases in those rates andshowed the greatest increase in the share of those below poverty. These observations highlight,once again, the trend toward an increasing number of single-headed households (mostly female-headed) and point to their heightened vulnerability.As the tabulation for educational attainment indicates, the two population segments with ahigh school education or less continue to make up a preponderance of those with incomes belowthe poverty level (86.6 percent). Poverty rates are much lower for those who have at least somecollege attendance. Adults with the least education (eight years or less) had by far the highestpoverty rate (42.1 percent) and the greatest increase in that rate (10 percentage points). However,the share of the poor who had less than an eighth grade education declined significantly. As wasthe case with the population in general, those below poverty were increasingly more educated in1989 than in 1979. Note the 9.8 and 4.8 percentage point increases in the share of poverty forgroups with 9 to 12 years of school and one to four years of college, respectively. However, thisincreased level of education is not just a reflection of changes in the general population, for thosewith 9 to 12 years of school experienced a significant increase in poverty rate (5.9 percentagepoints), while those with college experienced little change in poverty rate. Today's labor marketdemands highly skilled workers, and those workers armed with only a high school educationhave fewer prospects. For workers with less than a high school education, the outlook is evenmore bleak. 3 Calculations from data contained in Table No. 678: Families With EarnersNumber and Earnings: 1980 to 1993.

The poverty ratefor the group who did not work at all during 1989 was 39.5 percent, 10 percentage points higherthan in 1979. There was very little change in the distribution of number of weeks worked amongpoor adults with children. So, for this group the extent of work through the year did not changemuch between the decennial census years, but those working the fewest number of weeks had thehighest poverty rates and the greatest increase in those rates.Characteristics of Children in PovertyAs stated earlier, the defining characteristic of children in poverty is that they live with adultswho cannot provide a sufficient income to raise them out of poverty.4 For the most part, thechanges in rates and distribution of poverty noted above for adults apply similarly to children,where applicable. However, the poverty rates for children are higher than the corresponding ratesfor adults across the board.Just as the youngest adults had higher poverty rates, so do the youngest children (these arelikely the children of those youngest adults). Poor children aged five or under represented morethan one third of all children in poverty, and this youngest age group experienced the greatestpercentage point increases in poverty rate and share of poverty. Children in female-headedhouseholds comprised 40.1 percent of those below poverty. These children had a poverty rate of53.8 percent, much higher than the 16.2 percent for children living in married couplehouseholds.Additional insight can be gained from examining the distribution of those below poverty interms of their depth of poverty. After all, a family with income at 50 percent of the federallydefined poverty level has only about half as much income as a family that is slightly below thepoverty level. For children, the distribution of those below poverty is disturbing, in that over halfwere in households with incomes at or below 50 percent of the poverty level. There was anincrease of 4.5 percentage points in the share these poorest of children comprised of all poorchildren. Also troubling is that the segment of poor children in households with 76 to 100percent of poverty level was the segment which experienced the corresponding decline in share ofchildren below poverty. Thus, although there was a slight decline in the total number of poorchildren (as shown in Table 4.1), these slightly fewer children are deeper in poverty.Characteristics of Elderly KentuckiansBetween 1979 and 1989, the elderly in Kentucky did not experience the same changes inpoverty as the other groups. The poverty rates of all but the oldest age segment declined over theperiod. The rate for the oldest segment was essentially unchanged. Even with these observeddeclines, the elderly still have higher poverty rates than working-age adults. Also note that, forthe elderly, the oldest have the highest poverty rates but represent the smallest share of theelderly poor. By way of comparison, among children the youngest have the highest poverty ratesand represent the greatest share of poor children. The former may often be a case of personsexhausting financial resources and, thereby, falling below the poverty level, while the latter maybe a case of children starting out in families with insufficient financial resources.In 1989 more than 70 percent of the elderly poor were female, a share which increased by 5.5percentage points over the decade. The increase is likely attributable to the greater lifeexpectancy and somewhat limited attachment to historical income (such as through pensions or 4 For purposes of this analysis, children are defined as persons 18 years or younger and are not necessarily related to the head ofthe household, as they were in the Bureau of the Census definition used in the previous sections. Poverty in Kentucky 41 social security payments based on lifetime earnings) for elderly women. The poverty rate for bothelderly females and younger adult females was greater than that for the males in each of therespective age groups. However, the poverty rate for elderly females (27.2 percent) wassignificantly higher than the poverty rate for younger adult females (19.4 percent).Another major change for the elderly poor was the substantial decline in the poverty rate forthe elderly in nonfamily households (down 44.1 percent) even as this living arrangementaccounted for a growing share of both poor and nonpoor elderly households. It would appear thatone way in which the elderly have attempted to improve their economic security is by joiningwith nonfamily members to share scarce resources.The final tabulation provides the distribution of elderly below poverty in terms of theirhousehold income as a percent of the federal poverty level. The figures provide a further contrastbetween the nature of poverty among the elderly compared with poverty among children. Notethat the distribution for the elderly poor is inverted compared to that for poor children. Over 80percent of the elderly poor were in households with incomes greater than one half of the povertylevel, mostly unchanged from 1979. The comparable figure for the share of poor children wasless than 50 percent with a decline of over 4 percentage points from 1979. Thus, the elderly poordo not experie.nce the concentration of deep poverty which afflicts Kentucky's poor children.Summary and ImplicationsDefinitive state-level poverty measurement is only available in snapshots taken once every 10years with the decennial census. While care must be taken to not overrepresent changes betweentwo points in time as indicative of trends, insights can be gained from observing the changedpoverty situation of Kentucky vs. the United States, of Kentucky's growing vs. declining areas, ofKentucky's elderly compared to young adults with children, and of the changing composition ofpoor families in Kentucky.Throughout the analysis, several themes recur. Clearly, the young in Kentucky were worse offin 1989 than they were in 1979, and the elderly were better off, yet still experienced high rates ofpoverty. The general increase in poverty rates in Kentucky between 1979 and 1989 appears to bedriven both by higher poverty rates among younger working-age adults with children and bygreater numbers of female-headed households with children (not mutually exclusive groups).These groups are comprised of individuals most likely to have small children, which explainswhy over one fourth of the youngest children were below poverty and why their poverty ratesincreased so much.The increases in poverty rates among the younger working-age population between 1979 and1989 was indicative of an economy that did not provide economic opportunities matched to theskills and location of its younger citizens. Persons who are above poverty are more likely to beable to avail themselves of education and leave impoverished areas, hence the significant declinein numbers of persons above poverty, and the widely observed out-migration from counties withthe highest poverty rates. However, even counties that had the higher growths in populationexperienced a loss of children above poverty. This could be due to a lifestyle decision observedamong those with higher incomes to postpone having children until later in life, which mayresult in a disproportionate lowering of the birthrate among those above poverty.The elderly on the other hand, while having higher poverty rates than the overall population,experienced significant declines in those rates between 1979 and 1989 across all breakdowns foranalysisindicative of the benefits afforded by federal support programs. Elderly women had asignificantly higher poverty rate than elderly men and comprised about 70 percent of the elderlypoor. This is due both to less attachment to historical income for elderly women and to theirlonger life expectancies. The experience of the oldest segments of the elderly (higher povertyrates and an increasing share of the elderly in poverty) is likely due to an exhaustion of fixed orlimited incomes, particularly relating to medical expenses, for an ever increasing number ofpeople living past the life expectancies that existed when they or their spouses entered retirement.64 42Exploring the Frontier of the Future The driving forces behind Kentucky's poverty might be broken into several categories, eachwith its own possibilities for policy intervention. Poverty associated with the life cycle categorymight be defined as that related to older people exhausting their assets and younger people tryingto get started in life. Poverty associated with societal composition factors might be defined asthat related to changes in family size, structure, and demographic characteristics. Examples arethe increase in the number of female-headed families, possible differences in fertility ratesbetween poor and nonpoor families, and an increase in the general educational level whichmeans that those with some high school or a high school diploma account for an increasing shareof the poor. Finally, poverty associated with regional economic factors is related to a general lackof economic opportunities in the surrounding area and the propensity of those with the ability toseek opportunities elsewhere to leave.While the poor of Kentucky fall into all of these categories, the last category appears to play aprominent role in distinguishing Kentucky's experience over the decade from that of the nationas a whole. For the future, it is safe to say that areas which remain economically depressed arelikely to continue to experience out-migration that will be comprised mostly of those able to findwork elsewhere. Those unable to move (the elderly), and those unable to find jobs with sufficientincomes (the unskilled, female heads of households) and their children, are likely to findthemselves living in areas where poverty is increasingly common. Given that Kentucky has adeclining number of children, who are increasingly living in the deepest poverty, and given thewell documented research which indicates that poor children are less likely to grow intoeconomically productive adults (particularly in an economy which demands increasingly complexskills), the greatest change indicated by the analysis is not between the nature of Kentucky's pastand its present, but rather that its future seems so much more at risk. 65 Assessing the Future of Housing in Kentucky The author provides a brief national history of housing and focuses on long- and short-termdemographic and economic trends influencing the housing market in Kentucky. Long-term demographictrends, particularly the aging of the Baby Boom generation and its movement into peak earnings and move-up years, signals continued strength in the quantity and quality of single-family housing in the state. Inaddition, increases in the number of two-income households will continue to be a force in the demand forupper income housing. Housing for low-income Kentuckians, on the other hand, is becoming increasinglyscarce, and government assistance less certain. By F. Lynn LuallenKentucky Housing CorporationFifty years ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt recognized that we were \"one third of a nation ill-housed.\" Today, while conditions are quite different and much of the nation is overhoused,some 20 percent of households in the nation and 24 percent of households in Kentuckyremain, as Roosevelt described, \"ill-housed.\" Fifty years ago, the majority of housing problemsrelated to the condition of people's housing. Today, conditions have improved markedly, but theaffordability of housing has become a more serious problem, one that is affecting current housingand will continue to do so in the years ahead.The following trends must be addressed in any assessment of the likely future of Kentucky'shousing market:Changes in population and demographicsThe impact of interest rates and employment on housing affordabilityHousing starts and home ownershipOptions for lower income housingChanges in Population and DemographicsThe largest and most important impact on the housing market is tied to changing demograph-ics, specifically the aging of the Baby Boom generation. Born between 1946 and 1964, BabyBoomers are now in their peak move-up years, signaling corresponding strength in the quantityand quality of single-family housing. Members of the Baby Boom generation are also in theirpeak earning years now, which indicates continued strength in the move-up market. Two-incomehouseholds continue to grow among all household segments and will remain a force in the de-mand for upper income housing. During the second half of the 1990s and into the early 21stcentury, the trend for housing is positive. After that, the nation and Kentucky could face somereal problems due to the long-term demographics of the population.The whole of the nation's housing has two identities: much higher standards at the top thanat the bottom. Market rate construction is geared toward the top third of the market where profitsare readily made and where the industry has achieved very high production levels. This portionof the market drives the industry. On the other side, housing has its problems, including the de-cay of cities, where poverty, crime and drugs have escalated, as places to live. Some corporations,for example, have chosen to abandon existing urban sites rather than pursue rehabilitation andmodernization. In turn, jobs have been relocated, and people have abandoned cities. 66 44Exploring the Frontier of the Future U.S. and Kentucky householdshave typically chosen to live inlow-density,auto-orientedandauto-dependent communities, closeto metropolitan areas but not ac-tually in them. Today, the majorityof Kentuckiansliveinsingle-family houses located in relativelylow-density subdivisions. The ma-jority of past and projected futuregrowth is in and around the state'sthreelargestmetropolitanareaswith housing near the interstatehighway systems of 1-64, 1-65, 1-71,and 1-75. The clear preference is for the stand-alone subdivision.A question or concern often raised is: Can this development preference continue as it movesfarther out from the support of urban areas? Since the underlying forces that drive these patternshave not changed, and are not likely to do so until some time after the last of the Baby Boomgeneration passes through its housing move-up phase, this pattern will continue well into thenext century. In addition, improvements in communication and transportation will enable thesedevelopment trends to continue unchecked. However, basic subdivision design may change, aslow-density, auto-oriented, stand-alone community developments, also known as \"urban sprawl,\"have many critics.Vocal critics suggest that the stand-alone subdivision corrodes neighborhood values by in-creasing dependency on cars, separating people and diminishing community life. Nationally,there is a move fueled by a school of planners called New Urbanists who advocate the creation of\"villages\" instead of 'subdivisions. The concept calls for mixing housing sizes and styles, com-mercial entities, and recreational amenities all in the same development. The end result is acommunity with a variety of architecture, income levels, and business establishments.This theory of New Urbanism is being met with resistance in traditional states like Kentucky.However, it is a trend that is likely to become more prevalent. It is a design approach that usesland more conservatively by clustering buildings and services and preserving open spaces. Asrecent history has illustrated, land use is a top concern for local governments which must provideinfrastructure and services to citizens. Moreover, many citizens wish to preserve more greenspace and plan housing developments accordingly.Long-term trends in housing will be determined primarily by the numbers and the composi-tion of households. The number ofhouseholds is dependent on the agestructure of the population. Historicaltrends have shown that the majorityof household formation occurs in the25- to 34-year age group. Nationally,this group will decline from 19.8million in 1990 to 17.2 million in2000. In Kentucky, 25- to 34-year-olds are projected to decline from610,000 in 1990 to 522,000 in 2010.In addition, household composition ischanging; 25- to 34-year-olds marriage and childbearing,as well 5.2Kentucky Household Forecasts 19801990Source: University of Louisville199520002010202067 Assessing the Future of Housing in Kentucky 45 housing decisions. Single heads of household with children are also increasing; nearly one infour children lives with one parent. Because they are far more likely to be poor or low-income,housing decisions are profoundly influenced by household composition. The impact of thesetrends and the aging of the Baby Boom generation on the housing industry will become moresignificant after the turn of the century. Total households in Kentucky are projected to increasefrom 1,379,782 in 1990 to 1,643,609 in 2000.Housing AffordabilityDuring the 1970s, poverty in the state declined dramatically, from 23 percent of the popula-tion in 1970 to 18 percent in 1980. The improved economic circumstances of the lives of Ken-tuckians were accompanied by a corresponding decline in substandard housing. The number ofhomes without a bath, kitchen, or water was substantially reduced. In 1970, more than 20 percentof homes in Kentucky had no indoor plumbing, but by 1980, only 9 percent were without indoorplumbing.By the late 1970s, mobile homes had also assumed a significant role in Kentucky's housingmarket, moving from 4 percent of the state's housing to 10 percent in just one decade. Mobilehomes are usually moved only once, inexpensive, and financed like a car on the installment plan,enabling home ownership among lower income households. The number of mobile homes in-creased in Kentucky from 43,000 in 1970 to more than 125,000 in 1980, a 190 percent increase.In the 1970s, Kentucky followed housing trends similar to those which were evident nation-ally. Population was increasing rapidly and employment and income grew strongly. The nationalrecessions of 1970-1971 and 1974-1975 did not affect Kentucky as severely as other states. Em-ployment growth remained several percentage points above the nation from 1970-1976. At thesame time, Kentucky was producing record levels of housing, with the majority of housinggrowth occurring around urban areas. The stand-alone subdivision was the favored development.New housing units increased by 29 percent between 1970-1979, with nearly all the growth insingle-family detached homes. This growth in housing was supported by a great expansion ofmortgage debta growth that has continued, now doubling every six to seven years.In the early 1980s, Kentucky saw a rapid reversal of trends of the 1970s. The 1980-1983 re-cession affected Kentucky more adversely than the nation as a whole, and in many ways, the statehas never been the same. During the 1980s, employment growth slowed dramatically as didpopulation growth, and out-migration increased. With interest rates prohibitively high, employ-ment down and incomes below the rising cost of goods, housing demand in Kentucky declined.Household formation and employment expectations were also depressed. Housing prices in-creased 18 percent per year from 1980 to 1983, while median family income declined by 10 per-cent overall during this period. The loss of demand hit the housing industry in Kentucky hard, ashousing starts declined 23 percent each year from 1979 to 1982.The nation and Kentucky began a recovery in 1983, but the remainder of the 1980s were farfrom stellar for housing in Kentucky. Progress made in the 1970s all but halted. The volume ofhousing construction throughout the 1980s remained weak. More importantly, incomes, whileimproved from the recession, never fully recovered, and growth in income remained well belownational averages. Housing prices, however, which had increased during the recession, continuedat a strong pacealmost three times as fast as average incomes. When housing production beganto pick up again, it continued to be concentrated in the state's urban areas, the majority withinthe interstate highway triangle of 1-75, 1-71, and 1-64. The favored development continued to bethe stand-alone subdivision on the edges of the state's cities. Over 70 percent of Kentucky'shousing production was of this type and in these areas.The 1980s found the affordable and assisted housing market in even worse shape. Federalhousing funds were cut by more than 70 percent. Since the 1980s, a fairly strong correlation hasexisted between declines in federal housing support and increased housing problems and poverty.68 46Exploring the Frontier of the Future As noted, poverty in Kentucky was reduced in the 1970s from 23 percent to less than 18 percent.During the 1980s, poverty in the state increased from below 18 percent to 19 percent.The 1990s have been a period of more stability for Kentucky with some recovery from theeconomic changes of the 1980s. Population and household formation have stabilized in a slow-growth pattern, and the state has benefited from five years of economic growth. However, this hasbeen a sluggish period, only about half as strong as previous expansions. The housing industry,on the other hand, has been fairly strong with the majority of growth in the move-up market.Housing starts in the state have averaged over 15,000 per year since 1990, 43 percent greaterthan the same period in the 1980s. In addition, the size and cost of new housing have been in-creasing, providing greater profit margins for builders. Housing conditions are clearly an impor-tant component in continued economic growth and in the overall improvement of the standard ofliving in the state. In the middle market, the population is moving up in quality and moving fromrenting to owning, or at least obtaining better quality rental housing. At the bottom is housingthat is minimally adequate. The disparity in wage and income inequality, which began in theearly 1980s, continues to manifest in the housing market. The vast majority of housing is builtfor the top third of the market.The recession in early 1990 slowed housing production, but since then, the state and nationalhousing sectors have been growing at a fairly strong pace. As the economy enters its sixth year ofexpansion, the total housing market has enjoyed over four years of growth, with a short pause in1995 and stable growth expected through 1997. Interest rates should stay at a reasonable levelthrough the year, moving within a fairly narrow range of 7.25 to 7.75 percent. So while mortgageinterest rates are important to short-term housing activity, other variables will be more influentialover the next biennium, primarily employment and employment expectations.Housing Starts and Home OwnershipHouseholds pass through relatively predictable housing cyclesstarting out as young renters,to first-time buyers, to move-up buyers, to long-term owners, and finally to retirement home buy-ers. The Kentucky housing market is now dominated by the move-up buyer, with householdsaged 45 to 64 providing most of the demand. In addition, the young adult population, aged 25 to34, is declining and slowing the demand for apartments and starter homes. This trend will con- tinue into the next century as this por-tion of Kentucky's population continuesto decline. Between 1990 and 2020, themove-up market will increase by 58 per-cent while young renters and first-timebuyers will increase just 3.5 percent.Housing starts have been on an up-ward trend since 1990. Nationally, onaverage, more than1.3million newstarts of single-family and multifamilyhousing have occurred each year overthis period. Generally, one million an-nually is considered a good pace forhousing starts. Kentucky's housing mar-ket has equaled or bettered this trend,with starts averaging more than 15,000per year since 1990. For Kentucky, a healthy pace of housing starts is around 10,000 annually.Forecasts for 1996 indicate a 2.6 percent increase in housing starts over 1995. Single-familystarts are expected to increase 2 percent to just over the one million unit level. Housing starts inthe state have been increasing at an average annual rate of 7 percent and should continue at ornear this pace during 1996-1997. The first quarter of 1996 indicates that the year could be one ofFIGURE 5.3Housing Starts, Kentucky 199019911992199319941995Source: National Planning Association 13q Assessing the Future of Housing in Kentucky 47 the best ever for home builders in Kentucky. Market conditions are solid, interest rates are amongthe best in a decade; job growth is decent; and the misery index (the sum of unemployment andconsumer price levels) has descended to levels not seen since the 1960s. Both the economy andthe housing sector are expected to continue at current rates into the foreseeable future.Options for Lower Income HousingThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) celebrated its 30th anniver-sary recently, but dramatic change is on the horizon. Started in 1965, HUD was to be a key playerin the nation's war on poverty and the Civil Rights Act, efforts that sought to raise incomes andgive families the means to improve their own housing. Potential changes to this federal agencyare vitally important to Kentucky. For example, last year alone, the department insured morethan 10,000 home mortgages in Kentucky and since 1974 has financed or subsidized more than41,000 affordable rental units in the stateenough housing for a city the size of Bowling Greenor Owensboro. Unfortunately, some of HUD's programs are regarded by many as ineffective. Itmust be remembered, however, that the agency has never received funding adequate to meet itslofty goals. Now threatened, HUD has proposed rather dramatic changes, which, if implemented,will pose fundamental challenges for housing policy at the national and the state level.One proposal called Portfolio Reengineering would potentially affect 38,700 households inKentucky whose apartments are subsidized by the Section 8 program. The goal of PortfolioReengineering is to end project-based rental assistance oversubsidization. It is an effort to put theaffordable housing portfolio on sound footing. In addition, it may move federally subsidized andregulated rental projects to state and local control. It is clear that HUD must do something withits Section 8 project-based portfolio. The costs are simply too high. For example, 140,000 project-based contracts are expiring in 1996; renewal will cost an estimated $4 billion. If significantchanges are not made soon, Section 8 contract renewals will consume HUD's entire projectedbudget by the year 2000. The Portfolio Reengineering concept moves away from project-based(where assistance is tied to the rental housing) and focuses on tenant-based (where assistance istied to the renter). This policy has strong support from both Congress and HUD. While it maycost more in the short-term, it should save over the long run.Another proposal that may also be considered by HUD is consolidation of 60 separate pro-grams into three block grants: the Certificates Fund, Housing Fund, and Community OpportunityFund. This block grant approach has been implemented in several HUD programs in recentyears. It is an approach that offers states flexibility in designing programs that meet local needs.Block grants for local housing authorities are a new concept. Instead of receiving funds directlyfrom HUD, local housing authorities may compete for funds to operate public housing throughthe three block grants noted above, primarily the Certificates Fund, and they must submit a stra-tegic plan. In addition to competing for funds, local housing authorities may have to compete forresidents. Competition may be fueled by new units produced through the FHA Multifamily, Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and HOME Programs.Kentucky Housing Corporation (KHC) has developed a strong working relationship withHUD and implements many of its own lower income housing initiatives. Created in 1972, KHChas been a source of lower rate mortgage financing. In 24 years of existence, the Corporation hastouched 1 out of every 20 Kentuckians primarily by: (1) issuing more than 40,000 mortgage loansto qualified home buyers through the sale of tax-exempt bonds; (2) providing more than 36,000lower income households with rental assistance through HUD programs; and (3) financingand/or funding grants for rehabilitation, new construction and revolving loan pools.The Corporation's primary directives are to provide below market rate mortgage financing tolow- and moderate-income Kentuckians; offer home ownership education and loan servicing pro-grams; provide below market rate construction financing to home builders and developers to pro-duce affordable single-family and multifamily housing; serve as the state public housing authorityto administer federal rental assistance in areas without local housing authorities; administer the70 48Exploring the Frontier of the Future Low-Income Housing Tax Credit Program; and administer the federal HOME Investment Part-nerships, Emergency Shelter Grant, and Housing for Persons with AIDS Programs.There is the potential for major changes on the horizon in the affordable and assisted housingmarkets of Kentucky. While KHC works with a wide range of federal housing agencies, clearlyHUD is of major importance. As previously noted, the changes proposed for HUD will have amajor impact on the Commonwealth. For Kentucky, block granting of HUD programs will meanmore control and flexibility, but also fewer federal resources. Even if basic funding survives, theneed to manage programs at the local level will require more resources from state and local gov-ernments. In the coming biennium, expect HUD to focus on the reform of public housing, theconsolidation of homeless assistance, Portfolio Reengineering, and home ownership initiatives.The state's housing stock provides one of its greatest resourcesa home and family life forover one million Kentuckians. In too many cases, however, Kentucky households are not fullybenefiting from this resource. The cost of quality housing continues to climb while economicopportunities and subsequent wages have not kept pace. In addition, the state still faces manydiscriminatory barriers which restrict housing opportunities for minorities. Working to removethese can improve the quality of life for many Kentuckians and at the same time, open markets tofirst-time buyers and the underserved, which will benefit the entire housing industry. As indi-cated previously, the federal government's role in housing has been important to Kentucky. Thecurrent trend toward delegating more responsibility to the states will impact Kentucky's low-income households.All levels of government and the private sector must continue to work in partnership if Ken-tucky is to improve housing for the bottom one third of the market. Housing that is affordable tolow-income households continues to disappear, and housing programs designed to assist thesehouseholds have been hard hit and could shrink more if current proposals are carried forward.Kentucky also continues to face the possibility of losing the important Low-Income HousingTax Credit Program. It is practically the only way to finance low-income rental housing and ac-counts for a large percentage of total multifamily production in the state. At best, Kentucky willsee housing funds for the lower third of the market being distributed through block grants withslightly more flexibility, but at reduced levels. Over the next biennium, expect strength andgrowth in the top one third of the housing market, slight improvements in the middle third, andloss of available assistance and declines in quality in the bottom third.ConclusionAffordability is the key issue in housing. If the economy is favorable and current trends pre-vail into the next century, Kentuckians will continue to seek single-family housing in stand-alonecommunity developments. With shrinking federal housing assistance, state and local govern-ments will be charged with more responsibility for the housing of lower income individuals andfamilies.To decrease the growing difference and distance between higher income single-family hous-ing and lower income multifamily housing, the concept of New Urbanism offers a potential alter-native that may become increasingly influential in planning. Designed to blend economicdiversity and instill neighborhood pride at all income levels, this concept is gaining acceptance inmany areas. Several years will have to pass before the success of the New Urbanism can be meas-ured, but it may be a positive approach to meeting future housing needs of all income levels withequal access to jobs, schools, and transportation.The next biennium will be one of continued strength and growth for housing in the Com-monwealth. Look for housing production and prices to increase, especially in the move -up mar-ket. More responsibility will be given to local governments for housing lower income individualsand families. Historically, Kentucky is a state that has met challenges and will continue to do so. 71 The View from the Heartof he [- .eaDth Care Revolution In 1995, the Kentucky Health Interview and Examination Survey (KHIES) provided us with our mostcomprehensive look at the current health status of Kentuckians. Some unsettling results include: accessdeficiencies, geographic and economic exclusion from the health care system, high prevalence of chronicdiseases, inadequate programs for children's and women's health, insufficient utilization of preventiveservices, significant obesity, and depression reported in 11 percent of adults age 45 to 64. Some trends-already well under way may address these areas of need while others may exacerbate health care problemsin Kentucky. As we develop our vision for the future, goals for an effective health care system must includeexpanding access, enhancing quality, benefiting communities and managing costs. By Forrest Calico'Appalachian Regional Healthcare In1995, under the auspices of the Kentucky Department for Health Services and theUniversity of Kentucky Center for Rural Health, the Kentucky Health Interview andExarizination Survey provided us with our most comprehensive and unbiased look at thehealth status of Kentuckians. The results reveal an unsettling picture of the physical andemotional readiness of citizens of the Commonwealth to face the challenges of a newmillennium. Access deficiencies, geographic and economic exclusion from the health caresystem, high prevalence of chronic diseases, inadequate programs for children's and women'shealth, insufficient utilization of preventive services (even to the limited extent of theiravailability), significant obesity, and clinical depression stand out as challenges facing Kentucky.These examples provide ample opportunity for policymakers to develop and implement programswith the potential to improve health in Kentucky.Unfortunately, the trends discussed in this chapter are not all positive, nor are they easy toaddress positively. Powerful market and governmental forces for change may address some areasof need by design; other needs may be ameliorated as an economic side effect (improvement ofprenatal care to decrease costs of prematurity, for example). Unfortunately, many areas of needmay actually be exacerbated by trends already well under way.Fortunately, trends can be altered. If we recognize them, analyze them sufficiently tounderstand their origin and their impact on the health of the population, and estimate the rate ofchange, we can intervene proactively to reverse or modify trends, and even initiate new goal-directed trends. In order to effect positive results from trend analysis, Kentucky must create avision for health care, develop programs and action plans to move toward that vision and activelymitigate counterproductive or pernicious market and regulatory trends.As we develop our vision of the future, goals for an effective health care system must include: \u00a9Expanding accessoEnhancing qualityoBenefiting communitiesoManaging costsThe health care system is experiencing unprecedented, accelerating change from cottageindustry to big business, principally driven by market forces. Interacting with this enormous The author extends grateful acknowledgment to Robert Slaton, Wayne Myers, Rice Leach, and Kim Burford for theirassistance in development and preparation of this chapter.'7 \u00b0 50Exploring the Frontier of the Future dollar-driven engine for change are technological, demographic, and consumer forces whichcombine to produce eight noteworthy trends that will broadly influence health care.Accelerated Provider Consolidation and RealignmentComponents of this trend include hospitals, ambulatory services, home services, the publichealth sector, and payers. This trend will occur both vertically (i.e., alignment of hospitals,physicians, and payers) and horizontally (i.e., hospitals developing collaborative arrangements orequity mergers). Sophisticated communication and electronic information systems (clinical,demographic, and financial) are both the result of, and a sine qua non for, this consolidation.This trend is a response to the reduction of dollars flowing to providers with the intent of forcingincreased efficiency.Negativeimpactsof this trend includeexcessive HMO trustcan become operative,a positive impact oftrue collaboration canproduce benefits to all parties in terms of access, quality, satisfaction and cost. As integrateddelivery systems develop, the public health sector will function as an integral component,diminishing the current artificial public/private dichotomy.140120g 1008002 60ao200FIGURE 6.1Hospital Mergers in the United States American Hospital Association; Irving Levin Associates199019921994 More Managed Carein a Modified FormWe are beginning to see serious efforts to evaluate quality and satisfaction in the managedcare industry emerge. The new horizon for managed care will likely involve a shift to effectivequality-oriented care management, rather than simply forcing a decrease in the dollars flowing toproviders. Capitation financing (driving risk closer to the provider level) is a mechanism forincentive structuring, cost management, and change which is arriving on the scene in Kentucky.Managed care, as we have known it, has grown in response to demands for reduction of totaldollars flowing to providers. The effort has produced limited success. On the other hand, theevolving state of managed care is a result of excesses in profit margins, CEO salaries, andrestrictions on choice viewed to be egregious by the general public. This has directed moreattention toward precisely targeted improvement of care and cost management. 73 The View from the Heart of the Health Care Revolution 51 6050403020100FIGURE 6.2HMO Enrollment in the United States1980-1995 9.118.936.551.1 1980198519901995Source: Group Health Association of America, 1994; Emron, Inc., 1996The emerging focus on true caremanagement can positively affectoutcomes, cost, and quality. Moreeffective care management producesthe opportunity to reduce medicallyunnecessaryexpenditures.Capita-tion, properly managed, can be amajor component of a solution to theproblem of managed care as we haveknownit.When incentivesareplaced on wellness rather than onprocedures(a trend alreadywellunderway), the people of Kentuckywill win. Because of the complexnatureandsignificantpublicmission of health care, appropriate government oversight is needed to assure that the health caresystem is responsible and responsive to the needs of all Kentuckians.Expanding Home and Ambulatory ServicesThe components of this trend include home services, ambulatory surgery, office care byphysicians and other providers, partial hospitalization, alternative medicine, and care bynonphysicians. Also, technologyallowsdramaticallyincreasedsophistication of procedures thatcanbesafelyandeffectivelyperformed in home or office.The reasons for thistrendinclude cost management, tech-nologicalimprovements,ex-perience as itis gained by theprofessions, and changing ex-pectations on the part of pro-viders and consumers alike.Impacts of this trend includerapid growth of home services(which may be sufficiently robustto produce regulatory and market curbs on home service costs), conflict between physicians andhospitals, and the risk of poor quality. This trend has the potential to improve both cost andquality factors of health care. It can help create the continuum of care and effectively managepatient care and costs to optimize quality.500 4000o300C200 100soFIGURE Visits, 1988-1996Appalachian Regional Healthcare 2191162189 1115139286472 368 198819891990199119921993199419951996Source: Appalachian Regional Healthcare Corporation A Changing Health Care WorkforceComponents of this trend include an increase in primary care disciplines, decreased volumeof services provided by specialties (though specialty care is now being recognized as more cost-effective in selected circumstances), increased nonphysician providers, especially in primary carewith advanced registered nurse practitioners and physician assistants, and a continuing search forways to create incentives for the appropriate distribution of providers to match population-basedneed for all services.74 52Exploring the Frontier of the Future Reasons for this trend include cost factors, quality improvement, the clear need to have morecost-effective providers at the right place at the right time, and the necessity to maintain skilllevels of all providers by actively practicing at the appropriate level of their training. Bothgeographicandspecialtymaldis-tributionsaresignificant problems.We see instances in which specialistsperform generalist functions for whichtheyarenottrained,whiletheirspecialty skills tend to atrophy.This trend has huge implicationsfor health professions education.

Health care must be perceived as systemic, social, andethical, rather than piecemeal and for-profit. Meeting the societal responsibilities of health careto all requires finding a mechanism to assure access for the disenfranchised in the emergingmarket-oriented system. There is clearly a role for government in resolving this potentially cata-strophic situation.300002500020000 1989 1990 19911992 1993 1994 1995 1996 Source: Appalachian Regional Healthcare Corporation 75 The View from the Heart of the Health Care Revolution 53An Aging Population with New Health Care Demands 500'a 40002- 300C0Lo200 e_1000FIGURE 6.6Estimates of the Older Population inKentucky, 1995-2020(Persons Age 65 and Older) 199520002010Source: Kentucky Population Research, University of Louisville2020 This inexorable trend exerts pressure in direct oppositionconsumption of resources by the health care sector.Infectious Disease on RiseThis trend clearly increasesthe demands forservicesinchronic illness and long-termcare.Hence,thereisatremendous need to analyze oursocietalvaluesrelatingtotechnology use and terminalcare, and to define clearly theoutcomes we truly desire.

Appropriatecommunity input can, over time, effectively rationalize the health care system. Knowledgeableand positively involved individuals and communities constitute the only real solution to thecomplex puzzle of health care as itundergoes a revolution in today's socioeconomicenvironment. Again, government has a role to play in assisting market-oriented systems tounderstand their responsibilities to patients, populations, communities, and \"consumers.\"ConclusionOver the next four years, we can reasonably believe that economic forces, changing diseasepatterns, demographic changes, and increasing recognition of consumer and community interestswill be the major factors driving change in health care. The ethics of health care, in this turbulentenvironment, are being aggressively challenged and require societal debate, understanding, andadaptation to favorably impact the change process. The view from the midst of the health carerevolution suggests that possibly some more favorable trends lie ahead. To the extent that weunderstand and analyze trends and have a clear action plan for achieving our desired future state,we can work within current realities and modify existing trends for the benefit of the people ofKentucky. It will require thoughtful and extraordinary effort by policymakers and providers toreverse some established trends in order to achieve the goals of expanded access, enhancedquality, cost management, and community benefit.ReferencesCabinet for Health Services.

In a state-by-state comparison conducted in 1996, Kentuckyranked as the 17th safest state. Kentucky's rate for the serious crimes of murder, forcible rape, robbery,aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft was 3,449 per 100,000 people in 1995 com-pared to the national rate of 5,278 per 100,000. Some emerging trends in Kentucky include: an increasingfocus on domestic violence; the increasing cost of the expanding prison population; youth crime; guns andself-protection; and community policing. Ultimately, the solutions for fighting crime lie in strengtheningfamilies, integrating neighborhoods, building communities, improving social institutions, and finding re-warding jobs for all who need them. By John CurraEastern Kentucky UniversityCrime is a world problem, affecting nations, states, communities, and individuals acrossthe globe.' It is woven deeply into the fabric of life in the United States.2Americans reportthat they are more fearful to walk alone at night than they once were, but they do feelsafer at home than they once did.' The fear of crime varies with the perceived seriousness of acrime and the perceived risk of becoming a victim. Respondents in one study indicated that theyare more afraid of strangers loitering near their home than they are of murder because they be-lieve that murder, while serious, is rare. Fear is greatest when people believe a serious crime canactually happen to them.'Cross-national comparisons show that the United States has a higher rate of serious violencethan other industrialized democracies primarily because U.S. criminals are more likely to usehandguns in the commission of their crimes' The rates of minor violence and serious propertycrime are lower in the United States than in nations like England, Wales, Australia, and Canada.'If a worldwide crime waveexists,it has been causedprimarily by increasesindrug-related crimes.'Kentuckiansarecon-cerned about the problemsof State Poll(conducted from September26throughOctober1,1996), 806 individuals, age18 or older from the Louisville area, were asked what they thought was the most important prob-lem facing the country.

Respondents in an earlier Bluegrass State Poll from September 1992 reported lower levelsof concern: 5 percent picked drugs/substance abuse, and 1 percent picked crime.'When it comes to the crime problem, no simple answers or quick fixes are to be found. Curriereminds us that \"there are no magic buttons to push, no program waiting just around the cornerto reform the courts or strengthen the police or organize the neighborhood that will make crimi-nal violence disappear tomorrow. \"9 We can make our homes, schools, and communities safer andbetter than they are, but we are in for the long haul. Long-range planning is essential becauseworld problems require world-class solutions, the kind that only come from deliberate efforts toreach attainable goals.Crime TrendsThe 1968 Kentucky General Assembly enacted a uniform crime reporting law, mandating thecollection of information on crime in the Commonwealth. Crime in Kentucky 1995 is the 26thannual report. It informs readers that increases or decreases in crime rates can be caused by anumber of factors like the methods of tabulating and reporting used by law enforcement agenciesand differences in citizens' propensity to report crimes to police.'\u00b0 Places with high crime ratesmay simply be more efficient at finding and reporting illegal behavior, or changes in reportingprocedures can themselves influence changes in crime rates. For example, from 1994 to 1995,aggravated assault in Kentucky showed a 52.42 percent decrease. The reason is that less seriousaggravated assaults were downgraded to simple assaults and removed from the list of most seri-ous crimes.\"In a state-by-state analysis of the 50 U.S. states, the dangerousness of each one was deter-mined by using 14 separate factors like crime rates, changes in crime rates, changes in violentcrime rates, juvenile crime statistics, data on corrections, expenditures for police protection, andthe number of full-time police officers. In 1996, Nevada was classified as the most dangerousstate in the nation (replacing Louisiana). Kentucky was ranked 34th, a situation in which thehigher the score (up to 50), the safer the state.'The Kentucky rate in 1995 for serious crimes of murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravatedassault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theftthe Index Crimeswas 3,449 per 100,000 a 83,5003,0002,5002,0001,5001,0005000FIGURE 7.1United States and Kentucky Crime Rates, 1995 CI United StatesKentucky MurderRapeRobberyAssaultBurglaryLarcenyM-VTheftSource: FBI, Uniform Crime Report g Garrett, R.

The rate of violent crime for a region is a compositenumber that covers murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Kentucky's violentcrime rate in 1995 was 365 per 100,000 people, and only 15 states had lower rates of violentcrime (Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Minnesota, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, North Dakota, SouthDakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming). Kentucky's prop-erty crime rate in 1995, which combines information on burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehi-cle theft, was 2,987 per 100,000 people. Only five states had lower rates of property crime (NewHampshire, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, South Dakota, and West Virginia).Not all people in the Commonwealth, nor in the nation as a whole, have an equal risk of be-ing victimized by crime. For approximately 20 years, an annual survey of victims of crime hasbeen conducted in the United States. This survey measures the number of rapes, robberies, as-saults, and thefts that Americans experience. Since their peak in the early 1980s, victimizationshave declined over time.'5 Males, young persons,' blacks,\" Hispanics,\" residents of central cities,and the poor tend to have higher rates of victimization. Rates of victimization tend to declinewith age. However, elderly victims are the most likely to be traumatized by their experiences,partly because they more physically vulnerable, but also because they are more likely to face as-sailants who are strangers and to be victimized in or near their own homes.'Population characteristics and changes in them over time influence crime rates. Seventy-fivemillion babies, the Baby Boom generation, were born in the United States from 1946 to 1964, 70percent more people than were born during the previous two decades. By 1994, the Baby-Boomgeneration made up approximately one third of the U.S. population.\" Increases in U.S. crimerates of the 1960s were caused in part by the Baby Boomers entering the crime-prone yearsI4to 24and decreases in U.S. crime rates in the 1980s were caused in part by Baby Boomersleaving the crime-prone years behind.\"Some of the demographic changes occurring in the nation as a wholepopulation growth,urbanization, and increases in population diversityare not found to the same degree in Ken-tucky. Kentucky's population growth in the 1980s was sluggish, increasing only 0.7 percentthroughout the decade (compared to a national increase of 8.7 percent). This stagnancy wascaused in part by an out-migration of individuals in their early 20s.22 A reversal of this pattern ofout-migration is underway, and predictions are that Kentucky will experience moderate popula-tion growth in the years ahead, an increase of 7 percent, or 240,000 persons, from 1990 to 2020.\"Despite some population increase, Kentucky will continue to be primarily a rural state, and it willlack substantial racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity.2' In 1990, 92 percent of Kentucky's popula-tion was classified as white, 7 percent as black, and the remainder from other categories \" Kentucky State Police.

Economically deprived groups are heavily involvedin serious criminal offenses, especially violent street crime.\"Poverty is higher in the South than in the Midwest, West, and Northeast, and it is quite per-sistent. Kentucky's poverty rate in 1989 was 19.0almost one person in five lived in povertyand the Commonwealth's rank was 46, which meant that only five states had higher rates of pov-erty.\" Things were not much different 10 years earlier in 1979 when Kentucky's poverty rate was17.6, and its rank was 45. Kentucky's poverty rate in 1969 was 22.9, and its rank was 46.\" In1993, 20.4 percent of Kentuckians were classified as living in poverty.\" Poverty does not inevi-tably cause crime, and a great deal depends on how income is shared and how the poor view their lot and their relationship to the nonpoor. Crime flourishes when valued resources are unfairlydivided, especially if the contrast between the rich and the poor is glaring.\"A central challenge for governmental agencies in Kentucky is to find ways to raise citizens'incomes enough to promote greater prosperity and social equality.34 Harsh inequality is unjust,damaging to human growth, and destructive of social order. Kentuckians in need require bothincentives and supports to make it possible for them to prepare for, find, and successfully holdjobs that pay wages and salaries that enable a sense of accomplishment that makes law-abidingbehavior and social conformity valuable and worthwhile. 25 Cabinet for Economic Development.

Domestic violence includes any of the following crimeswhen committed by one family member/partner against another: homicide, kidnapping, sex of-fenses, stalking, assault, and terroristic threatening.\" In fiscal year (FY) 1995, the Departmentfor Social Services received 21,089 spouse abuse reports.\"A study of 510 Kentucky women who were battered by their partners shows that batteredwomen often find themselves trapped in abusive relationships, not because they suffer fromlearned helplessness or battered-woman syndrome, but because of factors like poverty, low edu-cational achievement, the absence of child care facilities, and the unavailability or inaccessibilityof safe, affordable, alternate housing.\" Battered women are geographically and socially isolated,economically dependent, and subordinated by a cultural tradition of patriarchy in which a man'shome is viewed as his castle, and what he does there is viewed as his own business.\") Thosewomen who do manage to leave abusive relationships usually return and continue to be abused. Ifabused women find separate housing and their own jobs, they are usually successful in stoppingtheir abuse.\" Victims of abuse must be supported in their movement toward greater self-reliance.'In principle, police could be powerful allies of abused women. However, some police officersare unwilling to intervene in domestic disputes and reluctant to arrest abusive partners.\" Batteredwomen who have summoned police for help strongly believe that Kentucky State Police officersdo a far better job of handling domestic violence calls than do local police, probably because statepolice are more detached from rural communities and less likely to be compromised by familiar-ity with the abuser.\"The Department for Social Services in the Cabinet for Families and Children is legally re-quired to investigate all reported cases of child abuse, neglect, and dependency and to protectchildren from harm. In FY 1995, 63,313 children were reported as abused (physical and/or sex-ual), neglected, or dependent. Most of these children were under age 10 (71.65 percent), and justabout half were female (50.62 percent) and half were male (49.28 percent).\"Of particular concern to the Attorney General's Office is the sexual abuse of children. Thirtynew victim advocate positions have been established throughout Kentucky under a $1.6 milliongrant program. These victim advocates work in county and commonwealth attorneys' offices,rape crisis centers, and mental health agencies. Acting on proposals drafted by the Attorney Gen-eral's Task Force on Child Sexual Abuse, the 1994 General Assembly signed several bills into 35 103d Congress. (1994, September 13).

During FY 1995, 1,588 casesof child sexual abuse were opened. Fifty-two percent (828) of these cases were sent to CircuitCourt, and 48 percent (760) went to District Court. Of the cases that had been closed in CircuitCourt at the time of the report, 75 percent resulted in a guilty verdict on at least one charge; ofthe closed cases in District Court at the time of the report, 71 percent resulted in an indictment orguilty verdict on a least one charge.\" 00Soaring Prison Populations. For over two decades, starting in 1973, prisons in the UnitedStates have been experiencing a tremendous expansion, and the United States now has one of thehighest incarceration rates in the entire world.\" Many things contribute to soaring prison popu- lationsthe war on drugs, the Baby Boom, mandatory sentencing laws, longer sentences, andparole boards keeping felons behind bars longer. However, the major factor fueling the increasein prison populations is the predilection to send convicted felons to prison.\" Forty-seven percentof state prisoners in the UnitedStates in 1994 were being held forviolentcrimes,23percentforproperty crimes, and 22 percent fordrugs. Public-order offenses andmiscellaneous crimes made up therest.\"For most of the 1980s in Ken-tucky, spending on public safetycorrections and the state policewas the fastest growing of themajor budget items, with most ofthe increased funding going to theDepartment of Corrections. In FY1976, thestatepolice receivedmore money than corrections. of Correctionsreceives more than twice as muchmoney asstatepolice agenciesreceive, even though the Kentucky State Police started receiving a considerable part of its fund-ing from the road fund after FY 1988. These long-term shifts in funding priorities are causedmore by changes in sentencing and judicial policies than by rising crime rates.\" The long-termprojections are that spending on police and corrections will increase to 6.5 percent of the generalfund by the beginning of the next century.\"7FIGURE 7.3Violent Crime and Prisoner Population 6 4g 36-\u00b0. 2 FBI, Uniform Crime Reports; Sourcebook of Criminal JusticeStatistics, 1994; and Correctional Populations in the United States, 1994889194 46 Office of the Attorney General.

Research Brief.83 The Contours of Crime 61 The evidence is not particularly persuasive that increases in either the use of prison or theseverity of sentences will have much impact on the crime rate. In order for the threat of prison tostop criminal activities, the probability of going to prison following the commission of a crimewould have to be higher than it is now. Law enforcement agencies across the nation only cleared21 percent of serious crimes by arrest in 1995.\" Because the chances of being arrested are low,making prison more forbidding by increasing the length or severity of sentences will have littleimpact on fluctuations in the crime rate. If prisons have any deterrent effect at all, it is due toincreases in the certainty of punishment, not its severity.\"Prison populations in southern states have grown the fastest.\" As of January 3, 1995, Ken-tucky had 10,888 inmates housed in a variety of institutions across the statemaximum, me-dium, minimum security; private prisons; a boot camp; community service centers; and others.Sixty-four percent of the inmates are white and 36 percent are black. Most inmates are incarcer-ated for violent crimes (39 percent), followed by property crimes (27 percent), drug crimes (18percent), sex crimes (13 percent), and miscellaneous crimes (3 percent). The median age of in-mates is 32 years, and practically all inmates are male (94 percent).\" The average cost to incar-cerate a Kentucky inmate in FY 1994-1995 was $37.30 per day or $13,613.30 a year. Costs ofincarceration were highest in the Kentucky State Reformatory and lowest in the Eastern Ken-tucky Correctional Complex.\"It is likely a correctional establishment will always exist, but it is also very likely that its na-ture and function will change over time. Penal practices develop from the connections betweenpolitical, social, and economic factors in a community, and many changes within the correctionalestablishment are traceable to factors outside prison. Decriminalization of some current offenses,the discovery of an effective drug-treatment program, or a reduction in criminal violence wouldsignificantly reduce future prison populations. The rising costs of imprisonment have led to asearch for sanctions that are still punishing but that can be used in place of prisons.\"Youth Crime in Kentucky. In 1995, 8,612 people under 18 were arrested in Kentucky for thecommission of murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and autotheft. An additional 13,283 individuals under 18 were arrested for crimes like arson, vandalism,liquor law violations, drunkenness, and disorderly conduct.' Because of changes in the way theCommonwealth now records arrests (based on the number of persons arrested), Crime in Ken-tucky cannot be used at this time to make long-term comparisons. However, the FBI's 1995 Uni-form Crime Report indicates that nationwide, from 1991 to 1995, juvenile arrests rose 20 percent(while adult arrests increased 2 percent).6'When young people are arrested, especially for serious crimes, it seems particularly tragic.However, the situation may not be as grim as it appears. Statistics on arrest are not particularlygood indicators of criminal involvement, especially for minors. Juveniles are overrepresentedbecause they often commit less sophisticated crimes (such as vandalism and larceny), and theyare usually easier to find and arrest than adults.\" One thing is true, juvenile arrests are still arelatively small percentage of all arrests, both in the nation and in Kentucky. Nationwide, 18.7percent of the arrests for violent crimes involved people under 18 (1995),63and in Kentucky,13.87 percent of those people arrested for violent crimes were under 18 (1995).\" Self-report 54 FBI.

Crime in the United States 1995, 268.84 62Exploring the Frontier of the Future studies of juveniles indicate that nearly all juveniles break the law some time, but only a smallpercentage engage in persistent and serious crime.65House Bill 117 passed the Kentucky House of Representatives with no dissenting votes (96 RSBR 889).66 About two weeks later the bill unanimously passed the Senate. It was enacted on Monday, April 1, 1996. The bill presents a get-tough approach to juvenile crime. It mandatessevere penalties for serious crimes andmakes it easier for juveniles to be tried asadults. Parents can be forced to pay courtcosts and restitution for their children'scrimes, and responsibility for youth crimeshifted to a Department of Juvenile Justice,established to identify youth at risk, initiateprograms of rehabilitation, develop deten-tion facilities, and prevent juvenile crime.During FY 1994, 12,480 juveniles wereadmitted to detention centers, holding fa-cilities,and county jailsinKentucky.Eighty-eight percent of them were catego-rized as public offenders, and the remainderwere either status offenders (6.96 percent)or traffic offenders (4.75 percent).\"The search is on to find affordable, ef-fective alternatives to prison for juvenileoffenders. One controversial policy is theenactment of laws that hold parents legallyresponsible for the crimes and delinquen-cies of their children. Depending on thesituation, parents can be counseled, fined,or jailed for the trespasses of their youngsters.\" Boot camps have become another popular itemon many delinquency-prevention agendas. Boot camps generally involve a short period of incar-ceration for first-time offenders convicted of nonviolent crimes. Camp inmates follow a rigid schedule of physical training, work, and life skills development. Postincarceration aftercareservices are supposed to be coordinated with boot camp experiences.\"Kentucky's shock incarceration boot camp, as of January 3, 1995, held 49 offenders-55 per- cent of the inmates were black and 45 percent were white. Most were confined for property of- fenses (43 percent), followed by drugs (37 percent), and violent offenses (10 percent). The median age of inmates was 23.\" Kentucky's boot camp consists of a four-month program of in- tense supervision and military drill. A typical day starts at 4:30 a.m. and ends at 9:30 p.m., dur-ing which time inmates receive educational instruction, substance abuse information, life. skills training, and information about victims of crime. The program seems effective-83 percent makeparole-and those who complete the program but then break the law again are almost alwaysguilty of a technical violation, usually a positive urine test.The jury is still out on the effectiveness of boot camps.\" No one has shown that boot campscan consistently turn serious lawbreakers away from crime. Well-run boot camps can teach self- reliance and some valuable life skills, while boot camps that demean and abuse juveniles to scarethem straight may do more harm than good. Troubled youth may get the idea that abuse-verbalTABLE 7.2Arrests of Kentuckians Under 18 Years of Rape10.210.815.6Robbery14.915.326.3Aggravated Assault 7.16.411.2Burglary35.327.829,9Larceny27.924.333.2Motor Vehicle FBI's Uniform Clirne Reports. 65 Albanese.Dealing With Delinquency, 29.\" House of Representatives.

If it were not, why would their guards use it so often? Bootcamps may change some youth, but no one knows for how long or in what direction.\" A consen-sus is developing that intensive programs outside institutions help juvenile delinquents more thanincarceration in prisons and/or boot camps.\" Research suggests that youth who are imprisonedare more likely to continue in their criminality after release than youth who are given alternatesanctions.\"Youth have special needs that require more than a uniform get-tough approach. They need tosee some value in lawful behavior, and they need to develop a strong sense of self-worth. Whenadolescents carry weapons, steal from others, act violently, use and deal drugs, and join gangs,they do these things because they seelittle value in conventional behavior.\" A two-year study by the RAND Corporation Some juveniles may reach the point discovered preventive measures to encourage where they are willing to do practically high-risk youth to finish school and to teach anything to practically anybody. Theirlives are aimless, their bonds to society more effective parenting skills to the parentsare weak, and their stake in conformity of violent youth are more successful andis absent. A two-year study by the more economical than incarceration inRAND Corporation discovered pre- reducing youth crime. ventive measures to encourage high-risk youth to finish school and to teachmore effective parenting skills to the parents of violent youth are more successful and more eco-nomical than incarceration in reducing youth crime.\"Guns and Self-Protection. On Friday, March 29, 1996, Governor Paul Patton signed HouseBill 40, the concealed weapons bill, into law. Its purpose is to give citizens more self-protectionagainst predatory individuals. Citizens 21 years of age or older, who meet certain criteria, andwho buy a permit from the state to carry a concealed weapon, may now carry a hidden firearm.Some restrictions applymany businesses, universities, and schools prohibit the carrying ofweapons by anyone other than law enforcement officialsand applicants must take a course ofgun instruction to qualify for a permit. The ink was barely dry on the bill when just the kind ofthing that made critics nervous came to pass. An employee of McDonald's Restaurant in Rich-mond was washing the outer wall of the eatery. He leaned over to rinse his scrub brush, and a.22-caliber pistol fell from his shirt pocket, hit the ground, discharged, and shot him in thethroat.\" He survived the wound, but things could have turned out far worse. The man could havebeen carrying a more potent weapon, or someone could have been killed.Will concealed weapons give Kentuckians protection against crime? It is still too early to tell,but research shows that a gun in the home is far more likely to be used to kill a member of thathousehold than it is to be used to kill an intruder in self-defense. One study of 388 home homi-cides, half of which involved firearms, in the Memphis, Seattle and Cleveland areas, between1987 and 1992 found that 51 percent of the killings took place in the context of a romantic tri-angle or argument, and 77 percent of the victims were killed by a relative or acquaintance. Theauthors concluded that firearms are too dangerous to keep in the home, even for purposes of pro- 77 Bentayou, F. (1995).How should America deal with young offenders?

The Rich-mond Register,Al; A2.86 64Exploring the Frontier oftheFuture tection.78 However, this study only showed that guns in the home increase the levels of violence.It did not show that guns in the home are ineffective as a form of self-protection.Most gun owners do report that guns make them feel safe from harm, and they do believe thattheir guns will help protect them from criminals.\" Apparently, these owners are not kiddingthemselves. Gun-armed defenders usually face a criminal who is unarmed, so they do manage todeter a crime, often without firing a shot.\" We may provisionally conclude that the defensive useof guns by civilians can keep them from becoming victims of violent crime.The demonstration that the possession of a weapon averts violent crime does not prove that people ought to own one. At some point, individuals must deposit their concealed weaponssomewhere, and it is at this point that even the most responsible owner loses some control overhis or her weapon. Research. by David, Brent and his colleagues indicates that firearms in thehome increase the chances of a troubled adolescent taking his or her own life, no matter howcarefully the owners store their weapons.\"Kentuckians who carry concealed weapons will fear crime and criminals less, we may predict.Some will use their weapons successfully to protect others, themselves, and their possessionsfrom predatory individuals. However, the number of gun-related accidents and suicides shouldincrease if substantial numbers of people carry guns and store them in their homes.Community Policing. Policing used to be more proactive and community-oriented. Consta-bles walked the beat and knew the comings and goings of residents of the community. Theyworked to prevent crime and eliminate criminogenic conditions by making sure that doors werelocked, that suspicious individuals were questioned, and that residents were taking care of them-selves. One reason for the shift from foot patrols to cruisers was budgetaryofficers could covermore territory if they were in motor vehicles. Another reason was that foot patrols invited cor-ruptionthey made it easier for police officers to accept bribes or solicit payoffs.\"Americans do have confidence in the police. A Gallup poll from 1995 discovered that 88 per-cent of the sample had a \"great deal/quite a lot,\" or \"some\" confidence in the police.\" The confi-dence in police was higher than the confidence in church or organized religion, the U.S.Presidency, the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, or the criminal justice system.\" The only factorthat seemed to diminish confidence levels was minority statusnonwhites were less inclined to trust police.\"Does community policing reduce crime rates? Does it improve citizens' feelings of safety andsecurity? Most research indicates that community policing has a minor influence on crime levelsin an area, but it does seem to calm citizens' fears in communities plagued by crime.\" When po-lice do make a difference in crime rates, it is usually because they have attacked some risk factorsfor crime, like the illegal ownership of weapons.\" The resurgence of an interest in communitypolicing implicitly acknowledges that the quality of life in communities must improve beforecrime will decrease.Community policing is becoming more popular all across the nation, but it has always beenan integral part of police work in Kentucky. Many police officers in the Commonwealth work intowns and small cities where a sense of community is already present, and the officers are famil- 78 Kellerman, A., et al. (1993, October 7).

However, if communitypolicing is carried too far, it can become oppressive. Community residents may wish to be leftalone to deal with their own problems, and they may have a generalized suspicion of police.\"At some distant point, police may be replaced by physicians, theologians, psychologists, socialworkers, or urban planners. However, for now the police will carry the burden for a society thateither cannot or will not change, and they will remain an essential port of the U.S. crime-fightingapparatus. Despite the many changes in police activities, organization, and technology, policegenerally continue to do what they have always done. They try to insulate themselves from toomuch interference from superiors; they try to protect other officers; they try to do whatever theybelieve is proper and just in surroundings that have the potential for great personal injury; theytry to make arrests and provide services when they think it will do some good; and they try touphold the peace the best they can.\" These featureg of police activity are likely to remain constantinto the foreseeable future.Crime and Punishment in the 21st CenturyPhysicist Hans Bethe insisted that prediction is very hazardous, especially when it concernsthe future.\" We can appreciate the truth of his assertion by considering one effort from the lastcentury to gaze into the future. In 1893, the American Press Association (APA), a ready-printsyndicate based in New York City, commissioned 74 distinguished Americans to prepare shortessays in response to questions about how things would look in the United States 100 years in thefuture, in 1993.\"These futurists of the 1890s believed that by 1993, technology would have solved all of soci-ety's ills, and human nature would have changed for the better. While some predictions werecorrect, most were not. John Habberton, editor and author, predicted the disappearance of insur-ance companies (there will be no house fires because brick, stone, and iron will replace woodhouses) and the disuse of stimulants (because of proper cooking and better living habits). He in-sisted all marriages would be happy because men and women unfit for marriage would be exe-cuted. The journalist Junius Henri Browne believed that the law would become so simple thenumber of attorneys would be significantly reduced. He also believed criminals would be lessseverely punished and that their numbers would decrease because of educational advancements.The forecasters' predictions were incorrect primarily because human nature is not quite as pliableas they seemed to think, and technological improvements will transform human relationshipsonly so much.As we move into the next century, changes in society will create new crimes, and the criminaljustice system will be expected to respond to them.\" The rates of most street crimes will probablygo down, and the rates of white-collar crimes will probably go up. Females and the elderly willincrease their participation in criminal activities. Cities will be safer, and small towns and ruralareas will be more dangerous. The computer will become a major site of criminal activities. In-creases in the size of the elderly population will stimulate the growth of medical swindles andinsurance frauds.\" The rates of domestic violence, rape, and child abuse are likely to increase asvictims are encouraged to report their experiences to police and find better support services.\" 88 Weisheit, R., Falcone, D., Wells, L.E.

For example, auto theft may become obsolete. Auto-Avenger is a remote-controlled devicethat shocks a thief attempting to drive off in a stolen car after it immobilizes the vehicle.\" Weap-ons of the future may be safer. A computerized safety lock on a gun that reads the user's finger-prints or a gun locked by a combination would make it difficult for an unauthorized individual touse the weapon. Nonlethal weapons that immobilize an individual until he or she is apprehendedare already available (capture nets, immobilizers, or tasers), and they could become more promi-nent as the police use of deadly force is restricted.\" Criminals who do not pose an immediatethreat to others might be controlled through \"walking prisons\" in which an offender's move-ments are electronically monitored to keep him or her from committing future crimes. Criminalscould be required to wear implants that register their emotions and release drugs to sedate them ifthey get into trouble.\" The physical addiction to drugs might be remedied in the future by thediscovery of a drug that breaks an addict's habit.10\u00b0Future ImplicationsThe criminal justice system has an important role to play in combating crime, and few willdispute that we need an effective and efficient one. However, no amount of police, prisons, laws,or harsher and longer sentences will be able to do much to achieve the safe, secure, and viablesociety that we seek. We will not fix the crime problem with legislation and imprisonment.Crime exists because of fundamental social contradictions and the impact that these have on thehuman spirit and personal development.A deteriorating community, where people know little about their neighbors and lack concernfor them, offers great opportunities for predatory crime.'\u00b0' Not only will neighbors have little in-centive to treat each other with kindness and respect, they will have little incentive to help eachother in times of need.'\" What we are seeing in many parts of the United States is the impact ofdecades of neglect, economic deprivation, and social impoverishment on communities, families,and individuals.'\" The quality of the social environment must become a top priority in the nation,and it must remain an important item on the political agenda for the years ahead.'\u00b0`We in Kentucky might rest on our laurels and do nothing, taking pride in our relatively lowrates of crime. However, our quality of life might be improved far more if we resolve that onecrime is one crime too many and then work together to eliminate some of the more brutalizingsocial conditionspoverty, inequality, unemployment, prejudice, discrimination, lack of oppor-tunitythat can be the breeding grounds for both crime and human suffering.

High social support seems to reduce criminogenic strains, and itprovides the social capital needed to resist criminal involvement.'\u00b05Kentuckians will find themselves in the crossfire between what works and what they can af-ford, as well as between what works and what is consistent with their values. Different groupshave different understandings about the causes of crime and what should be done to control it,and they often clash with one another over goals and means. The crime problem cannot be sepa-rated from other social problems, and social problems cannot be separated from other happeningsin a society. The first step toward taking crime seriously is to renew our commitment to the long-term challenge of strengthening families, integrating neighborhoods, building communities, im-proving social institutions, and providing rewarding jobs for all who need them. At some pointwe must realize that individual change must be based on sociocultural change or it will fail.

Kentucky and the State of Human Rights Women and minorities do not have an effectiveNoice in Kentucky's political arena where critical socialand economic gains are won and lost. From income and wage inequities, to the quality of life they afford,women and minorities are disproportionately disadvantaged. Concerted attention is needed in order toenable the economic inclusion of women and minorities and the social inclusion that would enable indi-viduals from diverse races and cultures to become full participants in shaping a preferred future for theCommonwealth. By Saundra C. ArdreyWestern Kentucky University Citizensof the Commonwealth who participated in the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Re-search Center's 1995 public forums concluded that as we approach the year 2000, one ofthe goals of our state must be to create communities that value and respect all cultures,races, ethnic backgrounds and religions. These citizens understand the value of diversity andinclusion. As globalization advances, Kentucky must better position itself to become a full par-ticipant. Because, as the Center observes, persistent homogeneity may become an obstacle to de-velopment, a more receptive climate for diversity is key to our future.'Diversity simply means that all citizens are included in the political and economic institutionsof the state and in the very fabric of its society. Access to jobs, both in the private and publicsector, participation in the social and cultural life of communities, and citizen attitudes are meas-ures of the \"comfort level\" or the receptivity of an environment to diversity. This chapter exam-ines that climate of receptivity to diversity or the state of human rights in Kentucky through anexploration of economic, social and political trends affecting women and minorities in the state.2Political InclusionOne of the ambitious citizen goals presented in Visioning Kentucky's Future is that govern-ment at all levels throughout the state will be open, accountable, participatory and responsive.3This expressed goal, of inclusion in the policymaking process is shared by democratic republicsaround the world. Broad citizen participation helps to assure that the goals and objectives of citi-zens will be translated into policy outcomes. Extending women and minorities a voice in theprocess that determines the allocation of limited resources is of paramount importance in thedrive to improve opportunity and the socioeconomic status it enables.In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Commonwealth of Kentucky defined women as citi-zens, but citizens were afforded different rights on the basis of sex, race and ethnicity. Despitethe formal equality the right of citizenship ordinarily entails, women were denied the right tovote and the right to hold public office. Upon marriage, a woman experienced \"civil death,\" alegal arrangement that merged her interests and her identity with her husband. She could notown property and had no legal custody of her children.

Visioning Kentucky's Future. Frankfort, KY: Author.91 70Exploring the Frontier of the Future Such restrictive rules and regulations were gradually overturned when Kentucky ratified the19th Amendment in June 1919. With ballot in hand, Kentucky women began the long and ardu-ous task of reforming state laws relating to women's rights, especially those that denied womenthe same opportunities as men. While Kentucky women have narrowed the socioeconomic gendergap, there is still much work to be done.In the political sphere, gains have been marginal. In 1990, women represented 52.1 percent ofthe population of Kentucky, a majority status that has yet to be matched by a concomitant numberof female elected officials. The 1,115 women who hold elected office statewide places Kentuckywith Alabama and Louisiana, those states with the lowest female representation in the nation.Today, according to the Secretary of State's office, only 14 percent of local government officesare held by women. No women presently serve as commonwealth attorneys, and only two aresheriffs. Just three women are circuit judges while four serve as coroners. School board posts (27percent women) are the most common office held by women. Fifty percent of county clerks arewomena bright spot in an other-In 1990, women represented 52.1 percent of wise dismal picture of femalelevel, whilerepre-the population of Kentucky, a majority status sentation at the countythat has yet to be matched by a concomitant only 4 percent of the state's judge-executives and only 9 percent of all number of female elected officials. fiscal court members are women.Figures for cities are slightly better.Of the 400 mayors, 60 are women, and 11 percent of city council members are female. This por-trait of underrepresentation is mirrored in the General Assembly where, as of January 1997, onlynine women serve in the House and two in the Senate. In this critical arena, Kentucky ranks nextto last in the nation.Not only do these statistics demonstrate how far women must go to become a more potentpolitical force, they also partially explain why many legislative issues affecting women are notpriorities. For example, a recent bill designed to bring pay equity to women in state governmentsailed through the House only to hit a snag when a Senate committee amended it to require fa-vorable consideration of men when setting pay for state job classifications.' According to a studyby the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights, women in state government earn only 87.4 per-cent of what men earn.It is somewhat puzzling why women have not been more successful in translating their num-bers into representative parity. Kentucky women account for 54 percent of the eligible electorate,and their political participation, i.e., registration and turnout, shows only slight gender differ-ences. In the 1992 presidential election, registration for all eligible Kentucky citizens was 64.9percent with 57.6 percent voter turnout. Among men, registration was 66.1 percent and voterturnout was 59 percent while female registration was 63.8 percent with turnout at 56.3 percent.In Kentucky, however, women trail the national average in both registration (-6.5 percent) andturnout (-3.3). Likewise, among Southern women, Kentucky women had lower rates of registra-tion (-5 percent) and turnout (-4 percent).One of the reasons women have not translated their majority into legislative mandates hasbeen the obstacle of developing a strong public consensus around full equality for women. As aresult, the woman's \"voice\" seldom speaks as a block vote behind a consensus agenda or candi-date although gender preferences are increasingly evident. In Kentucky, the state's political cul-ture of factions that favor men and the \"good old boy network\" also inhibit female participation.Few women are recruited for office by party patriarchs, making it more difficult for them to raisethe funds needed to mount effective campaigns. Women also confront the burden of jugglingfamily obligations with those of service in Frankfort. All of these barriers combine to attenuatethe ranks of women who run for office.9 2 4 Pay equality bill takes hit in senate committee. (1996, March 15). The Courier Journal,p. 2B. Kentucky and the State of Human Rights 71 While the barriers are formidable, women must run for public office if they hope to improverepresentation. Clearly, the electorate has demonstrated considerable receptivity to female candi-dates. Indeed, research shows that in open seat races where a woman faced a man, women wonmore than half the time.'The political history of African Americans in Kentucky in many respects has reflected thepolitical experience of Blacks in the nation and the South in particular. While the vestiges ofslavery fostered a rigid Jim Crow system in Kentucky that persisted throughout much of the 20thcentury, African Americans were entrusted to vote without discrimination and empowered withall other constitutional rights and privileges in 1870. Since that time, African Americans havemade significant political strides with pioneers such as Charles Anderson, the first AfricanAmerican elected to the Kentucky legislature in 1936, and Georgia Powers, the first AfricanAmerican to serve in Kentucky's Senate, paving the way for others, such as Mae Street Kidd andCharlotte McGill. Currently, there are four African Americans in the House and one in the Sen-ate. But African American representation in the General Assembly is only 3.6 percent comparedto 7.1 percent of the population, a level of representation that ranks 29th among all states and13th among the 19 southern and border states.Indeed, Kentucky has the smallest number of black elected officials of any southern state.While partly a reflection of Kentucky having the smallest black population in the South, the gapbetween representation and popula-tion is not negated. Nearly 17 percent The goals of inclusion and of a participatoryof urban Louisville's population is government remain illusive in KentuckyAfrican American while 13 percent because a significant segment of theof the Lexington population is black. state's population continues to be Combined, Lexington and Louisville shut out of the political process. comprise 57 percent of Kentucky'sblackpopulation.InJeffersonCounty, the fiscal court has one black member out of three seats. Blacks hold four seats on Lou-isville's 12-member Board of Aldermen, and in Lexington, the urban-county council has twoblack members. Other municipalities in the state do not fare as well. Bowling Green-WarrenCounty (13 percent black population), for example, has one black commissioner.Broadly, black representation is increasing. Sixty black elected officials held municipal of-fices in 1996, an improvement from 49 in 1988. The number of school board members also in-creased from a record 17 in 1978 to 25 in 1996. Twenty-seven black women served in electiveoffices in 1988, compared to 16 in 1966. One black woman serves at the state level as a represen-tative from Jefferson County. However, Madisonville, which has a 13 percent black population,has no black representation, nor does Hopkins County, the population of which is 7 percentblack.Voter registration and turnout levels among African Americans in the state mirror participa-tion rates in the South and in the nation as a whole. For the African American community inKentucky, registration for the 1992 presidential election was 61.4 percent while voter turnout was53 percent. In the South, African American registration and turnout were 64.7 percent and 54.3percent. National figures for African.Americans were 63.9 percent for registration and 54 percentfor turnout. Registration and turnout were slightly higher in the white community at 65.5 percentand 58 percent respectively.The goals of inclusion and of a participatory government remain elusive in Kentucky becausea significant segment of the state's population continues to be shut out of the political process.Women and minorities do not have an adequate voice in the political arena. This absence cannotbe attributed to disparities in political participation, as the data demonstrate that the rate of par-ticipation, while low for all Kentuckians, varies only slightly between women and men and be-tween minority and majority communities. Moreover, a turnout rate of only 56 percent suggests 5 Ardrey, S. (1994). Data collected on the political behavior and participation of women in Kentucky.9 72Exploring the Frontier of the Future there is much potential for growth. Though we are making progress in the number of women andminorities elected to public offices, it has been slow and incremental.Economic InclusionMost Kentuckians depend on their jobs to provide for themselves and their families. Dis-crimination interferes with an individual's ability to provide that support and is a violation of theKentucky Civil Rights Act. This Act prohibits discrimination in employment, housing, publicaccommodation and credit on the basis of race, color, religion, age (40 and over), sex, disability,national origin, or family status. Yet discrimination continues to take a toll.Sexual harassment in the workplace is a significant economic threat for many women. ABluegrass State Poll, conducted by the Courier-Journal in September 1995, found that almostone in four working women in Kentucky had experienced sexual harassment on the job. Thenumber of sexual harassment complaints filed in Kentucky with local, state and federal agencieshas risen steadily from 59 cases in 1989 to 183 cases in 1994. It is unclear if the increase is in-dicative of increased occurrences of sexual harassment or greater awareness among women thatsuch treatment is illegal. The majority of sexual harassment cases involve \"hostile environment,\"rather than physical breaches. A \"hostile environment\" involves such issues as unwelcome sexualadvances, requests for sexual favors and other verbal/physical conduct that create an offensivework environment.' Importantly, women in Kentucky have strong advocates on this issue. TheU.S. Supreme Court, Kentucky lawmakers and the Human Rights Commission all stand firm thatsexual harassment is not to be tolerated and is a violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.As a general rule, consideration of key economic indices such as the distribution of incomeand wage earnings are not only of interest in and of themselves, but also as an indication of qual-ity of life disparities. Women and African Americans are at the lowest end of the economic lad-der and, more often than not, entrapped by poverty. The primary reason for these circumstancesare the income and wage disparities between men and women and between the races. Census datafrom 1990 show that Kentucky women employed full-time earned an average of $18,352 a year,compared to $29,283 for their male counterpartsan earnings gap of 62.7 cents for each dollarearned by men. Nationally the gap was 64 cents. Even among women there is also a racial gap.White women on average earned $18,458, compared to $16,272 for African American women.African American women, however, earned more relative to African American men-99.9 centsper dollarthan did white women relative to white men-62 cents per dollar earned by whitemen.'This disparity in wages is also evident in the corridors of state government. In Status ofWomen in Kentucky State Agencies, 1994, the Human Rights Commission reports that women instate government earned 87.4 percent of their male counterparts' wages, $23,391 compared to$26,778. Nevertheless, the average female wage rose 2.6 percent from 1990 to 1994, a positivetrend which has steadily improved since 1978. During this time, the female workforce expandedin the professional, official and managerial classes, as women gained 745 positions. Women,however, continued to be excluded from 568 job classifications or almost one third of all jobclasses in state government. While women in state government are making progress, the rate ofimprovement has been slow. At this pace, according to Beverly Watts, Executive Director of theCommission, at the current rate of improvement, workforce and payroll parity will not beachieved until the year 2005.In a similar report, Status of Blacks in Kentucky Government Agencies, 1994, the Commis-sion found that the gap between average salaries paid to black and white employees narrowed by$174 between November 1991 and November 1994. Blacks were paid on average $4,434 lessthan whites in 1994; $20,970 compared to $25,404 per year. Although the 3.8 percent reduction 6 One woman in four says she's been harassed. (1995, October 26). The Courier-Journal.7.Stewart,H. (1991, June). Womenin Kentucky: A documental profile. Frankfort, KY: Cabinet for Workforce Development.94 Kentucky and the State of Human Rights 73 from the salary gap of $4,608 in 1991 was small, it was the first decline in the salary measuresince 1975. Similar to the integration of women into more state agencies, the Commission foundthat blacks were assigned to more job classes, fewer were assigned to job classes with a high con-centration of blacks, and fewer job classes were all white in 1994 than in 1991. While it appearsthat much progress has been made, closer inspection reveals that eight of every ten jobs gainedwere concentrated in a few politically sensitive, high-profile, high-salary jobs in three cabinetoffices: Revenue, Public Protection & Regulation, and Justice. The report concludes that the pro-gress \"is a precarious one which could be easily retraced without continued vigilance for equityand a commitment to diversity by the new state government administration.\"8Such vigilance and commitment could be better assured through a genuine commitment to thestate's affirmative action program. The state's plan, enacted in 1972, requires that women andminorities be recruited, that managers be trained in \"equal employment opportunity,\" and thatdiscrimination be eliminated. While the hiring plan does not set goals or quotas, the informalmandate followed by most governors has been to create a workforce that reflects the state'spopulation. But compliance with the plan remains spotty at best, and retributions range from le-nient to nonexistent. Given the current economic state of women and minorities in Kentucky,affirmative actions are sorely needed in hiring practices and in the procedures governments useto purchase goods and contract for services.Louisville and Jefferson County have wrestled with set-aside programs and laws that encour-age purchasing officials to give up to 15 percent of the city's business to minority contractors.But in 1993, only 4.4 percent or $2 million of the $87 million budget spent on goods and serviceswent to minority-owned businesses. To increase minority business participation, the city andcounty governments have sponsored loan programs and seminars on how to win governmentcontracts and distributed a directory of minority vendors to government agencies. Invitations tobid sent to general contractors are accompanied by the names of at least five minority vendors aspossible subcontractors' A stronger commitment to such affirmative efforts and greater incen-tives must become a statewide priority if Kentucky is to overcome economic disparities.Since women and African Americans on average earn less than men and whites in the state,they are less able to provide the necessities of life and often number among the ranks of the im-poverished. According to the 1990 Census, about 6.3 percent working families at the nationallevel were found below the poverty level. However, if the family was headed by a woman, thefamily was far more likely to be poor. In Kentucky, nearly 12 percent of all working families livein poverty, but 35 percent of female-headed families are poor, nearly double Women in Kentucky earned less moneythe national rate. The poverty rate for and were paid lower wages than African American women who head men at all educational levels. households is even more devastating at40 percent. One of every five blackfamily heads with at least one year of college is poor, a decrease in the 1980 poverty rate of onein three in poverty. Over the course of the decade, the number of African American women withsome college living in poverty actually increased nearly 7 percentage points.Generally, education determines the level of income and wage compensation. Not so forwomen. Women in Kentucky possess the majority of bachelor's degrees (59 percent), as well asthe majority of degrees at the graduate and professional level. Further, women in the state earned58.6 percent of all degrees in 1989-1990.1\" Yet women earned less money and were paid lowerwages than men at all educational levels. Female college graduates actually earned less than menwith less than a high school education.\" 8 Kentucky Commission on Human Rights. (1995). Status of blacks in Kentucky state agencies. Louisville, KY: Author, 3.9 O'Doherty, M. (1993, October 9). City, county falling far short of goals in minority contracts. The Courier-Journal, p. 2A.to Stewart, 7.\" I Stewart, 29.9 74Exploring the Frontier of the Future Income and wage disparities clearly have implications for quality of life. Health, for example,is a nearly perfect measure of quality of life. Healthy people enjoy a higher quality of life, becausethey remain economically productive longer and live longer. The health of Kentucky's women isindicative of the state's health: 25 percent of all pregnant women do not receive prenatal care inthe first trimester of pregnancy, and nearly half of the teenage mothers receive no care. The in-fant mortality rate, the number of deaths for infants under one year of age, is consistently higherthan that of the United States. While Kentucky's mortality rate went down 14 percent from 1988to 1989, deaths of infants born to teen mothers experienced an increase. Twenty-three percent ofthe infant deaths were from this group.' High rates of infant mortality and poor health of womenpersist despite efforts of state agencies and community outreach organizations. Efforts are hin-dered by the inaccessibility of many of the services. Stewart reports that in a recent study, womensuggested that lack of transportation, money, knowledge of facilities/activities and lack of childcare were barriers that caused them to forego health facilities and related services.Disparities in quality of life are reflective of an unequal distribution of wealth and income inKentucky. Further, no trends toward a narrowing of the gap between the races are discernible,and only minuscule progress is being made between the sexes. From most indices, the incomegap appears to be widening. Much of the gap between the haves and the have nots is grounded ingender and racial inequities that serve only to separate communities, deepen hostilities and pre-empt communication.Social InclusionThe degree to which women and minorities are part of the social fabric of a community isanother benchmark on which to evaluate diversity. Full inclusion in the life of the communitymeans the ability of all groups to live and to interact socially without prescribed constraints orotherde factobarriers. Several laws have been enacted to ensure equality of opportunity andequal access for the women of Kentucky. Gender-biased signs and advertisements, for example,are illegal in Kentucky. In spite of the protections enacted, discrimination continues to inhibit thesocial inclusion of minorities. Nevertheless, recent tragedies in Kentucky have awakened citizensand communities to the consequences of hatred and bigotry.Racial incidents over the past two years have highlighted two irrefutable facts in Kentucky:hostilities between the races continue to exist andmuch work remains to be done to bridge thegap between majority and minority cultures. The October 1994 accidental shooting of an AfricanAmerican youth by a white police officer sparked several days of civil unrest in Lexington whereAfrican American leaders have warned for years that racial problems, which run the gamut fromjobs discrimination, to crime victimization, to housing access, have been simmering, largely un-acknowledged by a white-dominated power structure.\"But crisis and conflict are helping Kentuckians forge community and confront racial divisionswith a new honesty. The Lexington incident has resulted in unprecedented community attentionto racial inequities. Groups such as Citizens Advocating Responsibility and Equality (a group oflocal black organizations and businesses) and the Mayor's Youth Council (a group of high schoolleaders) are sponsoring \"speak outs\" and other public forums to discuss race relations. Local in-stitutions, including the urban-county government and the Chamber of Commerce, are initiatingor expanding projects to make jobs available to minorities. And African American leaders arebeing consulted as public officials map city goals and objectives for the 21st centurya level ofcooperation heretofore unheard of in Lexington.Much the same kind of community togetherness was seen in Guthrie, Kentucky, when a whiteyouth was killed by four African Americans angered by a Confederate flag in the back of theboy's pickup truck. The shooting precipitated numerous cross burnings and angry confrontations 12 Stewart, 12.13 Wilson, R. (1995, January 30). Lexington slaying puts races in touch as grand jury meets. The Courier Journal, p. 1A.0 Kentucky and the State of Human Rights 75 that exposed smoldering racial tensions in this Tennessee border town. But the boy's family andblack churches in the community called for calm and unity. In McVeigh, Kentucky, a small coalmining community on the West Virginia border, clashes between black and white high schoolstudents have caused town leaders to begin openly discussing racial divisions. And in BowlingGreen, several incidents in the city's predominantly black west side have spurred police efforts torecruit minority officers. The percentage of minority officers in the city's police department islower today than it was 10 years ago. With an estimated minority population of 13 percent in thecity, only four of the city's 90 officers (less than 5 percent) are minorities.While racial incidents and hostilities still surface in both urban and rural areas, the state ismaking progress toward an inclusive, mutually accepting environment. The Commonwealth hascome a long way since the 1960s when resistance to desegregation inflamed tensions. The key tocontinued progress is through social interaction and familiarity with \"the other.\" In JeffersonCounty, where tensions flared 21 years ago when students were bused to achieve court-mandatedracial balancing, integration has advanced significantly. The percentage of interracial marriageshas more than doubled in the last 10 years. In 1985, one in every 100 marriage license issued inthe county was for a black-white couple, compared to one in every 50 licenses in 1995. In 1970,17 Jefferson County census tractshome to more than 50,000 peoplehad no black residents.By 1990, only one all-white tract, home to about 4,000 people, remained. But the movement ofAfrican Americans out of inner city Louisville into the suburbs of Jefferson County is a work inprogress, as most residents of Jefferson County, as well as elsewhere in the state, continue to livein neighborhoods that are racially identifiable.Slowing the movement, of course, is the lack of employment opportunities and low wages formany African Americans. The cost of homes in the suburbs remains outside the financial meansof most black families. In Fayette County, for example, land values south of the downtown Lex-ington area have attracted mostly affluent whites. Less costly housing developments north ofdowntown have attracted less affluent blacks. The result is a city divided by race.\" This modernday version of segregation perpetuates a cycle of discrimination in Lexington and other cities thatis caused by a housing market that discourages mixed-price-range homes within a neighborhood;subtle and institutionalized discrimina-tion in mortgage lending, real estate, and In Fayette County, for example, land valuesinsurance; school building policies that south of the downtown Lexington area have accommodate segregated neighborhoods; attracted mostly affluent whites.

TheAuthority provides residents who are interested in moving into integrated neighborhoods withmore housing options than are available in traditional minority neighborhoods with transporta-tion to search for rental property and acts as an ombudsman between clients and potential Section8 landlords.\"Innovative ideas like the Lexington land use plan and the Section 8 suburban, desegregatedhousing program are to be encouraged; no doubt the citizens of Fayette and Jefferson County 14 Kentucky Commission on Human Rights.

The Human Rights Commission of Kentucky has worked diligently for several decadesto ensure that state agencies and businesses not only comply with civil rights laws and mandatesbut also to create an environment throughout the state that is inclusive. Several examples illus-trate this effort. The Kentucky Civil Rights Act, under the Public Accommodations provision,prohibits racial discrimination in public facilities. At the urging of the Commission, racially of-fensive street signs throughout the state are gradually being removed. The Kentucky TourismCabinet adopted a policy in the Spring of 1994 concerning the sale of Civil War memorabilia inits state parks. The Department will sell only Civil War items with interpretative and educationalvalue and only in parks with direct ties to the Civil War. The new policy was developed after theTourism Department was notified by the Kentucky Commission on Human Rights that the dis-play and sale of Confederate flags and symbols were considered offensive to African Americans.\"ConclusionKentucky, like most states, has its fair share of racial problems, as well as lingering genderinequities. But the state is fortunate to have a plethora of organizations and citizens who areseeking honest solutions to inequities and racial differences. Black and white Kentuckians agree that individuals and families are primarily responsible for improving race relationsmore re-sponsible than the media, schools, police or the government. Consistent with this belief in socialresponsibility, individuals throughout the Commonwealth are meeting in groups to discuss theproblems that divide and opportunities that unite the races. Groups such as the Bridge BuildersRoundtable and Network in Louisville and black and white congregations that speak out againstchurch bombings are fostering a new climate of receptivity to diversity and change. These are the individuals on the front lines of the struggle for equitygroups of average citizens workingshoulder to shoulder with elected and public officials and the business community to begin dia-logues that will dissolve the hatred and the lies that divide us. 9 8 18 Kentucky Commission on Human Rights. (1994). Section IIOur Emerging Culture of Learning /n this section of our report, we turn to the emerging culture of learning and its impact onindividuals and institutions in our society. An intensifying demand for highly skilled workersand a widening earnings differential linked to education are compelling broad societalchange. More and more individuals are pursuing education and training beyond high school inresponse to the demands of a changed economic context. At the same time, these new demandsare challenging institutions to provide students with a broader, richer, more relevant educationalfoundation on which to build a lifetime of learning. To do so, they must redefine institutionalpriorities and restructure systems that no longer efficiently and effectively serve students and citi-zens.Here, Kentuckians are challenged to think back to our recent past and imagine what we mighthave hoped to achieve in the realm of education in the closing years of the 20th century. Thisexercise reminds us of what remarkable, previously unanticipated progress we have made in arelatively short time. It also serves to demonstrate what we can achieve in Kentucky when wemuster the will to change for the better. As we approach the 21st century, the Commonwealth ofKentUcky has become the preeminent national model for systemic school reform, a seeminglyunimaginable scenario just a few short years ago. Now, higher education reform has ascended tothe top of the educational agenda in-Kentucky, and substantive responses are expected to followin the years ahead.Mounting evidence also suggests that the people of Kentucky, regardless of age, are respond-ing to the call for individual change, applying their extraordinary work ethic to the challenge oflearning and becoming fuller participants in a marketplace that demands high skills in return foraccess to prosperity. Gradually, the sheer tenacity and the unsung ingenuity that have enabledmany to carve something out of nothing in economically depressed regions of the state is beingtransformed into a desire to learn and to expand personal possibilities. One by one, individuals,schools, colleges, and communities are shaping a new identity for Kentucky, one that will nolonger be defined by poverty and undereducation. Collectively, they are building a new legacy,one that will relegate \"the educational wasteland of the past\" to the margins of history.In this section, Dan Black, Kermit Daniel and Seth Sanders explore the relationship of earn-ings opportunities for high school graduates relative to nongraduates and their impact on highschool dropout rates. Specifically, they examine the experiences of Pike County, Kentucky, dur-ing the coal boom of the 1970s. Their conclusions underscore the importance of tangible eco-nomic incentives for educational attainment, which have diminished for high school graduates inrecent years, and of educational content that is closely linked to workplace demands.Robert Sexton and Stephen K. Clements review Kentucky's progress in school reform and thechallenges that remain. While the Commonwealth has made tremendous progress, the depths ofchange, they suggest, have yet to be plumbed. In the coming months and years, education poli-cymakers must contend with, among other issues, the perplexing problem of shaping reliabletools of assessment; the imperative of elevating both the quality of instruction and standards forachievement; and demographic shifts that will influence the population of teachers and students..Michal Smith-Mello discusses trends that are exerting pressure on the higher educationcommunity. Like their counterparts around the nation, Kentucky's publicly financed institutionsof higher education face an almost certain era of restructuring and change. Public concerns aboutcost and quality have placed higher education under unprecedented scrutiny that is unlikely to 99 78Exploring the Frontier of the Future abate. Neither are the underlying causes of increased costs to students. As a consequence, poli-cymakers and the higher education community face a difficult reckoning.In the final essay in this section, Stephan Goetz examines the forces influencing workforcetraining in today's economy. The rising demand for skilled technical workers who are oriented topost-Taylorist or \"high performance\" ways of working underscores the need to align educationstandards with the new demands of the work world. Kentucky's efforts to strengthen this link arewell underway, but its challenge is complicated by the need to train and retrain an aging work-force, engender a culture of learning in an undereducated population, and ensure returns to in-vestment in job training in rural areas where undercapitalized, low-wage firms dominate.In sum, these essays underscore the imperative of achieving institutional excellence that willlink educational priorities with the real world of work and accommodate the changing needs ofcitizens and enterprises throughout the Commonwealth. More than ever before, our economicfuture depends upon the commitment and the tenacity we bring to this immense challenge. Asour recent past has shown, the future will be what we determine to make it now. Both our re-markable progress and the sheer will of the people of this state suggest every reason to be hopefulabout what lies ahead for education in the Commonwealth. 1 0 0 The Earnings of Dropouts andHigh School Enrollments:Evidence from the Coal Boom and Bust The coal boom of the 1970s may have had an unanticipated outcome in Pike County, creating high-wage,relatively low-skill jobs in the local economy that effectively rewarded dropping out of high school. Theimplications are significant for an economy that has continued to produce incentives for college graduation,while providing little incentive to complete high school. These findings underscore the importance of linkingeconomic reward to academic achievement. Earnings opportunities for high school graduates can be improvedthrough better academic preparation for the workplace of today. By Dan BlackUniversity of KentuckyKermit DanielUniversity of PennsylvaniaSeth SandersCarnegie-Mellon UniversityEconomic theory suggests that when students make the decision to drop out of high schoolthey consider how their decision will affect their earnings. Thus, economists would expectthat, if the reduction in earnings from dropping out of school is minimal, dropout rates willbe high. As the loss of earnings for dropouts grows, however, the dropout rate should decrease. Thispaper summarizes an attempt to see if these predicted effects actually occur by looking at changesobserved in dropout rates in some areas of Kentucky in the 1970s and 1980s.The 1973 OPEC oil embargo caused a huge increase in the price of coal which, in turn, greatlyexpanded the demand for workers in the coal industry. Because many of the jobs in the coal industryrequire little in the way of formal schooling, this sudden change greatly affected the relativeearnings of high school graduates and dropouts in a very short time.Due to the oil embargo, Kentucky areas with coal experienced rising employment and earningswhile other areas within relatively short distances suffered the declines in economic activityexperienced by the overall economy as energy prices soared. As the oil prices declined, the demandfor coal also declined, causing a subsequent bust in the coal market in the 1980s. This reversed thegains in employment and earnings experienced in the coal-producing regions during the 1970s.The increases in coal prices in the 1970s were large by any standard. The real price of coalincreased 44 percent between July 1973 and July 1974, and then remained relatively stable untilabout 1978, when it began a gradual decline through the 1980s and 1990s. The large upswing incoal prices had a major impact on Kentucky's economy. In 1972, mining earnings accounted foronly 4.2 percent of the earnings of all Kentuckians, but by 1980 mining accounted for 9.4 percent ofearnings. The economic benefits of the coal boom, however, were not spread evenly across theCommonwealth. Only 52 of Kentucky's 120 counties have coal reserves and, among those withreserves, there is great variation in the amount.' Unfortunately for Kentucky, the coal bust thatfollowed was equally sharp. Between 1982 and 1992, there was an 82 percent reduction in thenumber of coal miners in Kentucky.'

Figure 9.1 prOvides a clearer view of the impact of the coal boom on high schoolenrollments. It depicts the rates of change between 1972 and 1982 in high school enrollments,enrollments in grades 5 through 8, and in population, for Pike County, Kentucky. Pike County is thelargest coal-producing county in eastern Kentucky, with a population of 72.5 thousand people in the1990 Census. Two features of the graph stand out. First, the change in population and the change inpre-high school enrollment track one another reasonably well. Second, the change in high schoolenrollments almost always moves in the opposite direction of changes in population: As populationincreased, high school enrollments decreased, and vise versa. This strongly suggests more and morestudents were not completing high school during the coal boom, but were dropping out to take jobsin the coal, and other industries, that were expanding at the time. The coal industry does notgenerally require its workers to have much formal schooling. As a result, the coal shock increasedthe earnings of high school dropouts relative to high school graduates, which caused a decline inhigh school enrollments.Further evidence comes from estimating the effect of changes in earnings on changes in highschool enrollment. Changes in earnings were estimated using data from the Bureau of EconomicAnalysis' (BEA) Regional Economic Information System for 1969 through 1993. Enrollment datawas taken from various sources within the Department of Education. The estimate made with thisdata indicates that a 10 percent increase in earnings within a county reduces high schoolenrollments by about 2.5 percent. Thus, high school enrollments seem fairly sensitive to theopportunities for unschooled workers in the surrounding area.If the coal boom reduced the incentive for some students to finish high school, then the coal bustin the 1980s should have increased the incentive to finish. Data from the Current Population Surveyshows that, during the 1980s, there was a fundamental shift in the distribution of earnings in 'theUnited States. Workers who had relatively more education received much higher real wages, whileworkers with relatively little education saw large reductions in their real wages. It seems reasonableto expect that the large change in relative earnings affected the incentives students had to attendschool.102 The Earnings of Dropouts and High School Enrollments 81 TABLE 9.1Relative Earnings of Kentucky Males Aged 25 to 55Current Population Surveys, 1980 and 1990Earnings of those who did not attend high school relative tohigh school graduateEarnings of high school dropouts relative to high schoolgraduatedEarnings of those who attended, but did not graduate, fromcollege relative to high school graduatesEarnings of college graduates relative to high schoolgraduatesEarnings of graduate degree recipients relative to highschool graduates19801990-27.8 %-33.8 cro-17.3-15.914.612.332.259.522.563.7Notes: Data from the National Bureau of Economic Research's outgoing rotation CD. Estimates are from a regression that includes controls forrace, marital status, potential experience, and time of interview. There are 1800 observations.Estimates for Kentucky males between the ages of 25 and 55, given in the first column of Table9.1, indicate that, in 1980, high school dropouts earned about 17 percent less than those whocompleted high' school. Those who completed college earned about 32 percent more than highschool graduates. The results for 1990, in the second column of Table 9.1, show a remarkablechange. By 1990, those who completed college earned nearly 60 percent more than those whocompleted high school. Thus, Kentucky seems to have exhibited much the same patterns of earningsas the United States as a whole.The results in Table 9.1 also indicate that wages of dropouts relative to high school graduates didnot change much over the decade. While in 1980 dropouts earned 17 percent less than those whocompleted high school, they earned only 16 percent less than high school graduates in 1990,although this difference is not statistically significant. Thus, the 1980s provided little change in theincentive to complete high school. The wages of high school graduates declined in the 1970s and1980s while the earnings of college graduates have increased.2 Thus, the incentives to attend collegehave increased, but not the incentive to complete high school.Implications for the FutureThe change in relative earnings during the 1980s appears to be continuing in the 1990s. Many ofthe jobs in the past, such as farming and mining, required little in the way of formal education. AsKentucky's economy changes, however, its labor market is reacting. Several industries are growingas we move from our traditional agricultural economy, to one more concentrated in manufacturingand service. Jobs in the manufacturing and service industries generally require more formaleducation. Growth in these industries increases the returns to finishing high school and to pursuinghigher education. As employers demand workers with greater skills, Kentucky should see reductionsin the dropout rate. In addition, more students will pursue higher education. The Bureau ofEconomic Analysis estimates pastand projects futureemployment and earnings by industry.These estimates appear in Tables 9.2 and 9.3. As the estimates show, the structure of Kentucky'seconomy and, therefore, the needs of its employers, are changing. 103 2 See Katz L.F., Murphy, K.M. (1992, February).

In 1993, coal miners werepaid an average of $39,000 per year. Over the past few years, however, both wages and employmentin the mining sector have decreased. This trend is expected to continue into the future, assuming noshocks to the economy occur that would raise the price of coal.From 1989 to 1993, services and wholesale and retail trade have shown relatively large growthin employment. Annual earnings in these sectors have seen little growth over the same time period.While little growth is expected in earnings per employee, the number of workers employed in theseindustries are expected to continue to grow. Currently, services account for approximately 24percent of the jobs in Kentucky. It is projected that the service sector will grow to account for 26percent of Kentucky jobs by the year 2000.Manufacturing ,accounts for approximately 15 percent of Kentucky jobs. Projections show thatgrowth in manufacturing should be enough to maintain its share of Kentucky jobs. Manufacturingjobs are relatively high paying jobs, averaging just under $26,000 per year.Other industries, such as construction, transportation, utilities, and finance, will continue toshow moderate growth. Farm employment has fluctuated in past years with a general downwardtrend that is likely to continue into the future.104 The Earnings of Dropouts and High School Enrollments 83 Earnings available in the job market appear to play a significant role in determining the amountof education people desire. Historically, when coal jobs paid high wages, many students in the localarea dropped out of school. The benefits to graduation were not high enough to keep those studentsin school. The Kentucky economy, however, appears to be moving to industries and jobs that requirehigher levels of education. As these jobs comprise a larger share of available employmentopportunities, students will find greater rewards from educational attainment.ConclusionsObviously, most policymakers would prefer students to stay in school. Analysis suggests that theearnings of high school graduates relative to high school dropouts are of fundamental importance indetermining the student's decision about whether to drop out. With the coal boom of the 1970s, asincreased value of coal increased the wages of coal miners and mining jobs were plentiful, there wasa reduction in the number of students enrolling in high school in the regions with coal to mine. Asthe coal industry then did not generally require workers with much formal schooling, these higherwages provided an incentive to drop out of high school. This reduction in high school enrollmentsoccurred despite rapid population growth in the areas of Kentucky with coal reserves.In 1990, Kentucky began a major education reform initiative: The Kentucky Educational ReformAct (KERA). The analysis has two important, but related, implications for KERA. First, it isimportant to recognize that general economic conditions affect the decision to complete high school.Thus, KERA could be remarkably successful, but high school enrollments could decline if theearnings opportunities for high school graduates continue to decline as they have since the middle ofthe 1970s. Second, if KERA is going to succeed in reducing the number of dropouts in Kentucky, itis important that there be an improvement in the skills of high school students not attending college.As employment opportunities change, the Kentucky secondary school system must provide highschool graduates with the skills future employers will require.ReferencesBlack, D., Daniel, K., Sanders, S.

From the development of accurate tools of assessment to enable reliable meas-ures of accountability, to the elevation of academic standards, to the institutionalization of participativedecisionmaking processes, the work of reform continues. It will be broadly influenced by changing studentand teacher demographics, by how generously we fund efforts to provide the best possible education to allchildren in the Commonwealth, and by how quickly we move from the framework of reform to commitment. By Robert F. SextonThe Prichard Committee for Academic ExcellenceStephen K. ClementsUniversity of Chicago/magine that we could transport ourselves back in time, about 10 years, and receive our as-signment for this essay: tell Kentucky readers about the likely directions for Kentucky educa-tion over the next five or so years. From the perspective of the mid-1980s we would havewritten of the possibilitynot the prospectof increasing school funding and improving educa-tional performance so that Kentucky could climb out of the nation's educational cellar. No longerwould Kentucky be 45th in per pupil expenditures or 50th in high school graduates in the popu-lation, we might have said, if the state were to make a full-fledged commitment to vastly im-proved schools.We might have hoped but not predicted in 1986 that, with luck, Kentucky would eliminatenepotism in hiring, replace the politically selected state school superintendent with a commis-sioner responsible to the state board of education, and provide preschool experience to all itsfour-year-olds. We might have hoped, although we would not have predicted, that high learningstandards would be established for all Kentucky students and that schools would be held account-able for helping students achieve them. In 1986, we could not have forecast the 1989 Rose vs.Council for Better Schools decision of the Kentucky Supreme Court. Nor would we have pre-dicted that Kentucky educators would, in 1996, be implementing the nation's most sweeping andcomprehensive attempt to increase learning for all students.That these conditions are in place shows palpably how the education landscape and our con-versations about education have changed. As a matter of course now, for instance, we think of thestate school system as being led by a commissioner of education, hired as a result of a nationalsearch, and accountable to a state board. It is no longer part of our thinking that the elected su-perintendent of public schools will be gone every four years, using the department of educationfor patronage hiring and as a platform for yet another public office.In debates over the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), we have not heard anyone ar-gue for returning to an elected state superintendent. Likewise, we have heard no serious call foreliminating high academic standards, preschool programs, family resource and youth servicescenters, school councils, increased school funding, or other reform components. Our educationalfuture is thus shaped by our current policy architecture. It is also shaped by how effectively thatarchitecture helps all Kentucky children learn.Researchers who are studying large scale, comprehensive educational changes like Ken-tucky's conclude that it is terribly difficult and slow for new state policies to affect what happensin classrooms. They compare the process of implementing change to a violent storm sweeping 86Exploring the Frontier of the Future across the ocean. We see smashing surf on the surface and perhaps some turbulence a few feetbelow, but at the ocean floor dead calm remains.In Tinkering Toward Reform, Stanford professors Larry Cuban and David Tyack stress theneed to learn from our history. They emphasize the power of the time lag between \"advocacy,adoption and implementation\" of educational changes. Reforms respond to problems, legislationis passed, but \"implementation has a momentum and schedule of its own.\" Past reforms werefrequently just \"add ons\" that \"did not disturb the standard operating procedures of the schools.\"Those reforms which endured were \"noncontroversial;\" they \"did not exceed the pedagogicalspeed limit, did not directly challenge the public's notion of what a real school ought to be do-ing.\" A real school, of course, is one that looks pretty much like those adults attended when theywere children. \"When educators see reform demands as inappropriate, they are skilled in findingways to temper or evade their effects,\" Tyack and Cuban observe.So Kentucky has confronted its historical educational deficiencies and is working its way to-ward solutions. But influencing those solutions and implementing them is very difficult work.Trends that will affect Kentucky schools are exerting influence within and outside of the educa-tional system. We focus in this essay on a few of the most difficult educational policies being at-tempted. External to the educational system we concentrate on conditions that always have andalways will shape public schools the mostthe condition of families and school children.Increasing Student Learning Through Accountability, AssessmentWhat happens over the next few years with Kentucky's new accountability and assessmentsystem will shape Kentucky's educational future profoundly. Changing the incentives to encour-age good teaching in Kentucky schools is the biggest lever available to policymakers, and Ken-tucky is using that lever like no other state. In 1989 and early 1990, when the reform plan thatbecame the Kentucky Education Reform Act was germinating, many political leaders and educa-tion policy specialists here and around the country argued that accountability was the key to im-proving American schools. Without school accountability, they said, the public would beunwilling to accept tax increases to fund education adequately. Further, we would not know whatknowledge and skills were most important for all Kentucky students and whether students wereindeed learning.They also believed, rightly, that existing standardized tests had encouraged educational mal-nutrition in Kentucky and across America. Proponents of an accountability-oriented reform pre-vailed, and the result was the creation of the Kentucky Instructional Results Information System(KIRIS) tests and portfolios to measure student performance, and a system of rewards and sanc-tions for schools and teachers.Since 1990, Kentucky has been the first state to incorporate accountability, financial rewardsand aid to help schools, improve, sanctions for poor performance, and aid for distinguished educa-tors into its educational program, a true \"high stakes\" accountability system. Numerous otherstates, including Vermont and California, have either recently passed or are moving forward onplans for their own high stakes assessment programs. But this has been a hazardous road, full ofdetours and potholes. No national tests of the sort envisioned in 1990 were available for stateslike Kentucky in 1990, so the Commonwealth had to develop its own.New tests measure school performance for accountability and form the basis for financial re-wards. Their purposes are to show citizens and parents how well schools are doing at their job ofeducating students, and to provide appropriate consequences for schools that are effective, as wellas those that are not. The tests are also meant to drive instruction and curriculum. Because test-ing is driving instruction, and because it has real consequences for teachers, it is imperative thatit be done extremely well and that it be credible.But parents expect tests, in addition to measuring school performance, to provide individualscores and national comparisons for their children. The big question is whether one test can doall of this; no one knows for certain, but most experts are doubtful. The challenge Kentucky facesIn,7 Trends and Issues Affecting Primary and Secondary Education 87 is being confronted all over America, as all states attempt to create high and measurable aca-demic performance standards.Inventing and using new assessments has been a costly, time-consuming, and somewhat er-ror-prone process. The first round of KIRIS exams yielded decent performance instruments andreasonable baseline scores for schools. Student performance, particularly at the elementary level,has increased substantially. But scholarly reviews of the tests have revealed reliability problems,and the rhetoric of these reviews (for example, \"fundamentally flawed\") raised questions aboutKIRIS that were as damaging as the criticisms of the standardized tests that preceded.' (KIRIS is,incidentally, Kentucky's fourth statewide test since 1979. Those tests too, a critic said in 1986,were \"seriously flawed.\")The State Board of Education has recently negotiated a new testing contract, and the nextround of exams should allay many concerns raised by testing experts, teachers, and parents.However, if serious problems continue to plague the assessment system it could spell trouble forthis most crucial school improvement component. The accountability system that KIRIS helpsstructure is an integral part of the political contract struck in the Kentucky reform package. Ifthis system falters due to assessment troubles, the public may lose confidence in public schoolsand the possibility of improving them.Several potentially serious problems lurk within this incentive structure. With regard to thereward system, little is known, either from research or from experience in other states, about howfinancial incentives will improve student learning. Recent research on Kentucky suggests thatrewards are associated with increased teacher efficacy. But it is as yet unclear if the rewards are acause or effect of teachers' beliefs and practices? Incentive systems are, indeed, hard to construct.Teacher reactions to rewardshave also been mixed. Manyteachers say that financial in-centives do not motivate them,but whether thisreactionisdeeply held is not yet clear. Saidone principal, \"If rewards be-come part of the regular landscape, just a 'regular thing' for about 10 years, teachers' negativeviews will change.\"The current incentive structure in Kentucky education also neglects the role of students. Aswe are reminded in an excellent new book edited by Susan Fuhrman and Jennifer O'Day, teach-ers, no matter how conscientious or motivated, have limited control over their students' responsesto increased work and higher expectations.3 And, since secondary school grades are not impor-tant for admission to most postsecondary institutions or for getting most jobs, incentives are notstrong for high school students to study more diligently than before under a \"reformed\" regime.A successful future for improvements may well depend upon incentives for students in collegeadmission and employment.Certain aspects of American culture and youth culture also militate against student achieve-ment. Laurence Steinberg and his colleagues argue that school reforms have failed largely be-cause of factors in the community and.beyond the control of schools.4 Almost one in three parentsis disengaged from his or her adolescents' education. Doing well in school is valued by only onein five youths. And only about 15 percent of the average youngster's waking hours each week isspent doing things that contribute to academic achievement.

A16. 1n0 88Exploring the Frontier of the Future dents and parents will have to change before achievement levels will rise significantly, no matterhow diligently educators work to improve learning.Kentucky has based its reform on the idea that real incentives and real school accountabilitycoupled with school flexibility, local decisionmaking, more school funding, and other helpfulschool programs will vastly increase learning. Five years of implementing such a dramaticchange now seems just a blip in the long sweep of time. Much of what will happen in the futureas a result of true school accountability depends upon changes in the larger community, the re-sponse of educators to increased demands, and the skills of those who design and study tests.Setting Rigorous Academic StandardsKentucky's school system has set high academic standards for students to reverse Kentucky'sdismal educational record. The process of creating such standards has been less visible to thepublic than other reforms, although no less important. The long list of academic expectations thathas been developed and rewritten several times sets high and reasonable goals for students, but istoo vague to replace the traditionally prepackaged, textbook-driven curriculum teachers used be-fore with teacher-designed curriculum. A time-consuming, collaborative process has been under-way for years to develop standards-related curricular guidelines for teachers to use in theclassroom, material that is linked to the KIRIS assessments.Two points stand out in the process of setting and achieving high academic standards. First, itis crucial to continue and intensify Kentucky's standards-setting efforts if significant learningachievement gains are to be reached. This is especially true for academically disadvantaged stu-dents who often suffer when schools decide for themselves what these children can learnusually not very much. The national standards movement has yielded curricular guidelines inseveral subject areas (although these are of uneven quality), but the nation has again balked atobliging states to adhere to standards set in Washington. This makes state standard-setting ac-tivities like Kentucky's much more critical. Only clearly identified, content-laden and coherentstandards in all subject areas can guide good teaching, help eliminate gaps in curriculum and, inconjunction with KIRIS, drive continuous improvements aimed at measurable goals. An honestquest for such high, specific academic standards will be arduous and will take political courageand skill. Kentucky and other states have failed to develop rigorous common academic standardsin the past, partly because it is difficult for citizens and teachers to agree on what is worthknowing. It has been easier for states to avoid the issue altogether, leaving standards to textbookpublishers and standardized testing companies.Second, a genuine standards-based education system will require Kentuckians to change theway they think about schools as institutions. With genuine standards in place, everyone associ-ated with elementary and secondary schools must become more focused on what is taught andlearned than on the means of teaching. A content-oriented approach will require more collegial-ity, cooperation, and egalitarianism among school stafffrom teacher aides to college of educa-tion faculty membersthan now exists. It is not clear that citizens of the Commonwealth,including those within the education establishment or the political leadership, are ready to em-brace such new ideas about schooling even though improving Kentucky's education system willdepend on it.Whether or not they are ready for it, Kentucky parents, teachers, and administrators may soonbe obliged to grapple with all these issues if the Kentucky Department of Education adopts theexcellent recommendations offered last summer by the Kentucky Commission on High SchoolGraduation Requirements. In its report, the Commission recognized that the current Program ofStudies for high schools is badly out of sync with the new higher learning goals and academicexpectations. It offered a three-prong plan for bringing them back into alignment with one an-other. First, the state should create a new Program of Studies designed around minimum courserequirements, with the involvement of local boards, high schools and communities in developingmore rigorous course requirements and tailoring the curriculum for individual schools. Second,109 Trends and Issues Affecting Primary and Secondary Education 89 the Commission calls for KIRIS tests to be altered so that individual high school students canreceive meaningful reports on their progress and so diplomas can be granted at different levelsbased on demonstrated skill mastery. Third, high school transcripts should be revamped to bemuch more comprehensive and revealing, providing portfolios of test scores, essays, career plans,project presentations, and the like.5Adopting these recommendations will require a gargantuan amount of work in high schoolcommunities across the state. But an effort of this sort, targeted at the high school level, builtaround high standards, accountability, strong academic programs at each site, and involving civicleaders, parents, and others into designing educational environments will be necessary if im-proved teaching in the early grades is not to \"wash out\" during the middle school and secondaryyears.Site-Based Decisionmaking CouncilsKentucky's education system is now designed as a set of integrated measures and not a hodgepodge of programs. The primary school program, the Support Educational Efforts in Kentucky(SEEK) funding formula, extended school services, family resource and youth services centers,and other components are all parts of a system aimed at increased student learning which ismeasured.An important part of this overall design is the school-based decisionmaking councils that giveteachers, parents, and administrators authority over key education matters. The school councilsmay have been oversold as agents of reform, but they are a tool with much potential for democra-tizing the education process and bringing about building-level improvements. Councils have thepotential to become vehicles by which schools focus on rigorous standards and content, developwell tailored assessment systems, improve professional development, and the like. School coun-cils could also serve as mediating institutions, brokering and directing change among school per-sonnel, and increasing parent knowledge of and involvement in school operations.It is still too early to pass judgment on the effectiveness of councils in Kentucky schools. Al-though 1,090 schools have councils, it may take several years for councils to meet the expecta-tions set for them. The past five years should be seen as a period of mere compliance with newlaws requiring councils. Only now can councils begin to focus in earnest on improving academicquality.Our impression at this point, however, is that many councils are falling short of their primarygoal, which is vastly improving student learning at the school level. According to Jane David, aresearcher who has studied school-based decisionmaking extensively, much council energy hasbeen expended on nonacademic issues, and relatively few parents in schools are involved in site-based decisionmaking work.6Since councils are still fledgling institutions, we should not expect too much of them untilthey have had a chance to mature and develop. If they fail to ignite interest among parents or tobecome useful instruments for forcing improved practices and better ideas into schools, we willneed to reconsider Kentucky's goals for these councils. Even if this happens, however, the termsof discussion will have been changed from the period of top-down local school management. Thefact is that councils exist in law parallel to local school boards and local central office administra-tors. If councils are measured by the yardstick of what they do to increase student learning, thenboards and central office administrators will be measured by this standard too. 5 Kentucky Commission on High School Graduation Requirements.

But the state's38,000 classroom teachers will, as a group, be changing over the next decade, and these changeswill likely have a profound impact on education.However, sudden or dramatic shifts in the teacher workforce are not likely. A recent SouthernRegional Education Board (SREB) report provides the most up-to-date information on teacherdemographic trends. The teaching force has remained remarkably stable for many years, with 93to 94 percent of all teachers having worked in the classroom during the previous year, and any-where from 4 percent to 6 percent of teachers retiring or leaving the classroom in any givenyear.7 The SREB report and a separate research study found no significant increase in teacherattrition after the Kentucky Education Reform Act.8 This is an important finding because somedisgruntled teachers have referred to KERA as the \"Kentucky Early Retirement Act.\" Rhetoricand reality conflict in this case. Some disgruntled teachers have referred to The total teacher workforce in KERA as the \"Kentucky Early Retirement Act.\" Kentucky, however, has grown Rhetoric and reality conflict in this case. by 8 percent since 1990, eventhough student enrollment hasincreased by only 1 percent. Projections are that teacher supply will meet demand over the com-ing years, so a shortage is not likely in the next 5 to 10 years.However, school administrators report great difficulty in finding qualified and interestedcandidates for school principal openings, particularly for high schools. Recruiting minorityteachers, especially in science and math, is also a substantial and unmet challenge.What is most interesting here is the effect on schooling as veteran teachers, trained in a dif-ferent era, retire and are replaced by more recent teacher education graduates. Newly trainedteachers are more likely to practice the types of teaching and classroom organization designed toreach all children and increase learning. It is possible, therefore, that new ideas and practices willenter Kentucky schools most rapidly through attrition and replacement.But current teachers also need to see themselves as part of a constantly changing professionand not as practitioners with skills that never need to be updated or adapted. The evolving natureof the teaching profession and the need for continuous improvement must be internalized by newteachers and promoted by policymakers. If this is not done, we risk retaining a teaching forceunable to adapt to change and unable to respond to improved professional development evenwhen it is made available.Central to the skills of teachers is the status of professional development. Over the past fewyears, the professional development of teachers has been taken much more seriously. Efforts havebeen made to make it more useful, more intellectually demanding, and less time-killing drudgery.But building teacher capacity to help students reach higher standards is a massive undertakingthat needs greater emphasis and more time. Unfortunately, polls show that while American par-ents believe teachers need constant retraining, they do not want professional development to taketime away from the classroom. The common misconception that teachers are not working if theyare not with children persists. The time available for teachers to do all that is expected of them,and for serious professional development, needs to be increased.Whether professional development for teachers can be improved enough to significantly im-prove classroom practices, whether enough time can be made available, and whether it can bedelivered in an effective manner remain open questions. Nor is it clear whether the training ofteachers at the college level will improve across the board as much as is needed.

They also gave rise to the 1985 lawsuit that resulted in the Ros\u00e9decision and the Kentucky Education Reform Act. Education finance issues are still crucial to thefuture of Kentucky schools.Overall education funding has increased 46 percent as a result of the 1990 reform act. This isa substantial financial commitment by Kentuckians to improve education. The spending increaseand the new distribution system have reduced the gap in per student spending between\"wealthier\" and \"poorer\" school districts by 52 percent.After substantial spending growth since 1990, however, Kentucky's education budget hasreturned to normal growth levels. The 1996 General Assembly approved a 4 percent increase for1996-1997 over the previous year's budget to be followed in 1997-1998 by a 3 percent increase.Much of the new money each year will be funneled into teacher salary raises, so many categoriesof funding within the overall education budget will see no increase or will be reduced over thenext biennium. For example, staff development, extended school services, technology, distin-guished educators, and textbooks will all be level-funded, so inflation will erode spending capac-ity in these areas.In addition, certain programs have never been fully funded. Kentucky is still far from reach-ing its ambitious goals of providing preschool opportunities for all qualifying children, familyresource centers to all eligible schools, distinguished educators to all schools that need them, oran adequate level of technology in every classroom. Without sufficient state funds, Kentucky alsolacks a critical tool for meeting the financial needs of both its poorest and its wealthiest schooldistricts.The outlook for education spending beyond 1997-1998 cannot be predicted. Executive branchexperts resist projecting spending beyond two- or four-year cycles, a product of limited technicalcapacity and the pitfalls of making the wrong projections. However, annual increases beyond the3 percent to 5 percent range are highly unlikely. Such minimal increases will barely cover growthin salaries and fringe benefits of education personnel in Kentucky. They will not help the statemaintain even current levels of service, much less move forward to higher levels so as to equalizefunding and provide adequate educational opportunities for Kentucky children.One condition is clear: Kentucky's revenue system does not produce revenue equal to growthin the economy because those sectors of the economy that have grown most vigorously in recentyears (e.g., the service sector) are taxed at a lower levelif they are taxed at allthan traditionalsectors of the economy. Moreover, the state's obligation for Medicare and prisons will increas-ingly squeeze out funding for schools and universities. Adjusting this inadequate tax system sogrowth is assured is imperative, as is controlling state spending for health care.An important subplot of the education finance story involves the physical plant of Kentuckyschools and the need to maintain or replace school buildings over the next decade or so. Accord-ing to the federal General Accounting Office, Kentucky is in better shape than many states interms of its school buildings, having run a comprehensive facilities program for a number ofyears. State and local governments in Kentucky have spent around $1.3 billion since 1986 onfacilities, and Frankfort continues to spend approximately $60 million per year on capital projectsfor school districts.Nevertheless, the needs for the future are staggering. One official estimate is that Kentuckyhas $2.7 billion in unmet education physical plant needs. Wayne Young, executive director of theKentucky Association of School Administrators, estimates that the facilities situation in the stateis nearing the point of critical mass. Many buildings are in surprisingly good shape for being 70or 80 years old, he says. But as these older structures slip beyond the point of repair in coming112 92Exploring the Frontier of the Future years, the burden of replacing them will be great. Moreover, the price of constructing new build- ings in Kentucky has increased with the passage of the prevailing wage bill in the 1996 General Assembly.The Kentucky legislature must cope with these costs without allowing them to overwhelm the ongoing budget needs of education. Toward that end, policymakers should consider not just con- structing and repairing buildings but devising ways to use facilities more efficiently.Related to future education funding is the matter of time in school. National reports and the Prichard Committee's own report, A Matter of Time, emphasize that meeting higher learning standards and more effective teacher professional development cannot be achieved unless educa- tors spend more time on these tasks and spend that time more effectively.9 Some Kentucky school districts are creatively finding ways to \"invent\" more time or spend local school funds on addi- tional days. The future will ultimately be shaped, however, by a state-level decision to support extra days of employment for teachers in the school year.Demographics and the Condition of ChildrenShifts in population within Kentucky will also play an important role in the future of educa- tion. The U.S. Department of Education has projected an increase in the total number of children in school over the next decade. Although this increase will be due primarily to the inclusion ofmore kindergarten students plus lower dropout rates, according to Education Secretary Richard Riley, this boomlet will nevertheless require more than $15 billion in new spending and the hir- ing of some 190,000 additional teachers.In Kentucky, though, the situation is shaping up very differently. Ron Crouch and his col- leagues at the Kentucky State Data Center describe the Commonwealth as being \"at risk\" over the next two decades because the number of school-age children here will remain steady or even decline as the number of older Kentuckians increases substantially. In 1998, Crouch reports, the number of 14-year-olds will be the lowest in 50 years. In 1950, 73,000 children were born in Kentucky; in 1994 the number was 51,000. Today only one third of all Kentucky households have school-age children. At the moment, the Kentucky economy does not appear to be produc- ing desirable jobs at an adequate rate to attract enough new workers and young families to offset these trends, or even to retain many of our most promising young high school and college graduates.This combination of an aging populationa significant portion of which is unskilled and undereducatedand a nonexpanding pool of school-age children could create troublesome social and political dynamics. With this demographic \"inverted pyramid,\" as Crouch calls it, the pres-sures to provide social support services for older workers and retirees will become greater and the political clout of families with children may weaken. Within the context of limited state revenue,this could mean that resources are diverted from elementary and secondary schools to other edu- cation and support services. Education and training programs are crucial for Kentuckians of allages. But shifting resources away from the basic investment in elementary and secondary schooling would not be a strategically sound approach, though the politics of demographics may encourage it.Much of Kentucky's future will depend upon how effectively the state confronts the appallingcondition of its children. According to the 1996 KIDS COUNT Data Book, Kentucky ranks 36th among the states in indicators of children's well-being. Kentucky has been improving in the ar- eas of infant mortality, high school dropout rates, and the dropout unemployment rate. But the state made no improvement in the child death rate and teen birth rate, and lost ground between 1985 and 1993 in the teen violent death rate, juvenile crime, children in poverty, and families headed by a single parent.1\u00b0 9 Prichard Committee for Academic Excellence.

Baltimore, MD: Author.113 Trends and Issues Affecting Primary and Secondary Education 93 These trends are discouraging, especially those involving increasing numbers of impoverishedchildren and children in single-parent households, who are far more likely to live in poverty thanthose in two-parent households. Children in these conditions face special barriers to becomingwell educated. Nor have educators or communities determined the most effective means of ame-liorating the effects of these conditions. Add to this worsening situation the unpredictable impactof national welfare reform, recently signed into law, and state policymakers will have their handsfull over the next few years.ConclusionThe conditions affecting the future of Kentucky schools that we emphasize here do not ex-haust the possibilities. They are, in our judgment, those that are most compelling today; otherswill emerge tomorrow. Obviously, national conditions and directions will affect Kentucky, but webelieve that what Kentuckians do for themselves in education will be more important than whathappens nationally.Most of the pieces of Kentucky's new education system are in place in a legal sense. Broadcompliance with new laws has already taken place. Primary school organization, for example,exists in all schools where they are required. The future depends, however, on moving fromcompliance to commitment. Commitment means that the quality of teaching in every classroomis sufficiently high to permit every child to learn to the maximum of his or her capabilitya tre-mendous and daunting challenge.History is littered with educational reforms that were abandoned before they were ever im-plemented, before they ever reached the classroom. In 1990, historian Thomas D. Clark observedthat the real work has just begun, the work of moving improved education \"from the legislatureto the classroom.\" In 1996, Kentucky finds itself on the way down this most difficult road as itmoves toward genuinely improved teaching,' for The direction in which Kentucky is all students, in all of its classrooms.Compared to 10 years ago, Kentucky today headed can overcome the educationalfinds itself in a remarkable, historically unique wasteland of the past century.position as the center of national attention. Re-form and change have become integral to the Kentucky educational system and subject to theanalysis, criticism, and suggestions for improvement that would be expected to accompany anyother system. The direction in which Kentucky is headed can overcome the educational waste-land of the past century. But six years after 1990, the magnitude of the challenges inherent intransforming Kentucky's schools are also more apparent. From the experience of Kentucky'seducators, we know much more about these challenges. The future of education in Kentucky,whether Kentucky maintains its leadership role, and whether it educates each child well, hingesupon how effectively and how quickly these challenges are met. 114 The Ivory Tower Under Siege State-supported institutions of higher education are coming under increased scrutiny as public con-cerns about cost and quality escalate. Tuition costs have risen dramatically in response to declining por-tions of revenue from the state. So too have higher education expenditures. But the revenue picture forhigher education is unlikely to change dramatically, and many fear that rising tuition costs are adverselyaffecting access. In response, policymakers face the difficult challenge of leveraging organizational changefrom institutions steeped in tradition. By Michal Smith-MelloKentuckyPolicy Research CenterAs the 21st century approaches, the path to economic opportunity is becoming steeper andmore fraught with uncertainty. The guideposts of the past are no longer accurate nor re-liable. Young and old, we have become acutely aware of how ephemeral even finelyhoned skills and the economic security they enable can be in an economy undergoing fundamen-tal change. In this transitional economy, higher education no longer offers the comfortable assur-ance of a high wage job that it once did. Its absence, however, virtually assures a lifetime of lowearnings. And the earnings divide along education lines is widening into a gulf.As a consequence of today's education earnings differential in the United States, far morepragmatic concerns are eclipsing the idealistic and generally accurate perception of higher edu-cation as a life-enriching experience. Those who pay for higher educationstudents, parents andtaxpayerswant higher returns on the rather substantial investment higher education now ex-acts. From the traditional college student newly graduated from high school, to the nontraditionalor \"new majority\"' learner, the pursuit of higher education is increasingly driven by economicconsiderations. When asked to name \"very important\" reasons for deciding to go to college, themost frequent response (77.3 percent) among college freshmen in the fall of 1995 was \"to be ableto get a better job.\" The third most frequent response (72.3 percent) was \"to be able to make moremoney.\"'The rise of a more pragmatic view of higher education has opened colleges and universitiesaround the nation to previously unthinkable scrutiny and criticism. More educated, better in-formed and far more demanding consumers have begun to express dissatisfaction with highereducation. Today's college students, regardless of age, and their parents want both the educationand the services of public schools in particular to be more firmly anchored to the real world. Notsurprisingly, they also want what most U.S. consumers have come to expectquality at a reason-able cost. But, from every indication, citizen/customers are not getting what they want. As Folgerand Jones observe, \"The gap between customer expectations and institutional priorities is largeand growing; the public is seeking something other than what higher education wants to pro-vide.\"3 If quality is indeed measured by customer satisfaction, as U.S. business and industry haveso convincingly demonstrated, higher education faces an era of dramatic restructuring.Public opinion polls suggest that the U.S. public wants more than the incremental change ithas witnessed in recent years.

The concerned about rising college tuition public and a legion of thoughtful critics want costs than about crime or high quality teaching to be a top priority, butthe health of the economy. slavish adherence to a publish-or-perish dic-tum remains the dominant standard of quality.Too often, the research this dictum compels isdevoid of original thought or broad benefit, a particularly troublesome outcome for public insti-tutions, although private colleges have become so dependent upon government financed studentaid that the line between public and private is blurring. Because institutional reward has re-mained essentially self-referential and consistently distanced from the actual outcomes of highereducation, little has changed. As a consequence, leveraging more of what citizens want fromhigher education means challenging \"a thousand years of tradition wrapped in a hundred years ofbureaucracy.\"'Many here and around the nation argue that the obvious remedy for rising tuition and con-cerns about the quality of public higher education is a dramatic infusion of public money. How-ever, recent history suggests that public coffers cannot satisfy higher education's appetite forgrowth. While a robust national economy may yield increased state revenues for a time, competi-tion for those dollars is fierce. Today, California dedicates more revenue to corrections than tohigher education,' a shift in resources that may be a harbinger of things to come in every state.Most agree that dramatic increases in allocations for higher education are unlikely at best. In-stead, the \"do more with less\" scenario of today is unlikely to change in the foreseeable future. Asan alternative to dramatic increases in funding, others conclude that states must compel systemicchange from institutions of higher education through outright budget cuts or such mechanisms asoutcome- or performance-based funding.The stakes surrounding today's higher education debate are particularly high for Kentucky.Because of the changing earnings-education ratio and the relative undereducation of our popula-tion, the Commonwealth could lose rather than gain income ground in the years to comeunlesswe achieve a dramatic reversal of our education status. While the long-term prospects for im-proved educational outcomes are significantly brighter due to school reform, the benefits will notbe felt for many years to come. In order to reverse a legacy of persistent poverty, net out-migration, and inadequate incomes, Kentucky must elevate the capabilities of more and more ofits working-age citizens. Without 21st century skills, Kentucky cannot develop a high skills, high 4 Sanchez, R. (1996, September 26). College tuition rides up escalator. The Washington Post,p. A3.5 Finn, C.E.

The challenge to policymakers is to leverage higher education reform without mi-cromanaging institutions and undermining their inherent strengths. The challenge to institutionsof higher education is perhaps more daunting: they must manage growth and change in an era ofdeclining revenue.Slowing Enrollment FIGURE 11.1Total Enrollment at State-Supported HigherEducation Institutions in Kentucky, 1986-95120,000 100,000 80,000 60,000 40,000 20,000 01986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 Source: Council on Higher Education0 Community CollegesUniversitiesFrom every indication, Kentucki-ans, who have historically underval-ued education, are responding to thedemands of a changing economiccontext that places a premium on edu-cation. In recent years, Kentucky'sstate-supported system of higher edu-cation has witnessed substantial in-creasesinenrollment,agrowingproportion of which is comprised ofnontraditional students or working-age Kentuckians whose education is sokey to the state's future. As Figure11.1 shows, the pace of enrollment atstate-supported institutions of highereducation stalled in the early 1990s,while it increased 29 percent over the 1986-1995 decade. University enrollment rose 18 percentand community college enrollment increased 71 percent, suggesting a diffuse awareness of thecritical role of education in economic well-being. Kentuckians comprise 88 percent of students atstate institutions of higher education.Today, nontraditional students aged25 and older comprise a substantial por-tion of the student population at Ken-tucky's state-supportedinstitutionsofhigher education. As enrollment in-creased over the 1986-1995 decade, sotoo did nontraditional enrollment, upfrom 37.8 percent in 1986 to 40.5 per-cent in 1995. While the percentage ofnontraditional students has, as illustratedin Figure 11.2, remained virtually un-changed for five years, 1993 Census datashow that nontraditional enrollment inKentucky (40.7 percent) paralleled thenational rate (40.2 percent) for thatyear.'Kentucky's nontraditional students also demonstrate remarkable persistence. Between 1986and 1995, the number of degrees awarded to students 25 years or older increased 50 percent. Ac-cording to the Council on Higher Education, nontraditional students who received degrees fromFIGURE 11.2Non - Traditional Students at State-SupportedInstitutions of Higher Education, 1986-1995(Percent of Students Age 25 and Older)4540353025201510501986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995Source: Council on Higher Education 9 Chronicle of Higher Education. (1996, September 2). The Chronicle of Higher Education Almanac, 17.1 1rl 98Exploring the Frontier of the Future community colleges increased from 54 percent of graduates in 1985-1986 to 71 percent in 1994-1995. The percentage of degrees awarded to nontraditional students at state-supported universi-ties rose from 34 percent during the 1985-1986 academic year to 46 percent during 1994-1995.While the data on nontraditional students are encouraging, many believe that institutions ofhigher education can do much more to accommodate the needs of working adults. A recent na-tional survey conducted by Washington State University with support from the University ofKentucky found that a significant majority of Americans are fully aware of their ongoing need foreducation and retraining; 81 percent of respondents recognize that their success at work is tied totheir education.'\u00b0 What they do not find are accessible opportunities in higher education that meettheir needs. Many who work full-time want courses of study that accommodate their workdays,their busy schedules, and their need to compress learning modules into shorter periods of time. Inorder to become more responsive to this growing customer base, institutions of higher educationmust schedule more classes at night, compress courses of study, create more experiential learningenvironments, and increase distance learning opportunities. As the survey authors note,\"Teaching conducted in the traditional campus classroom will not meet the public's demand fortailored educational services.\"\"Interestingly, women in Kentucky, as well as around the nation, are more likely to take ad-vantage of the opportunities higher education has to offer. According to the Council on HigherEducation, nearly 88,000, or 58 percent of the 150,499 students enrolled in Kentucky's state-supported system of higher education in the fall of 1995, were female. This represents a gain of 2percentage points over the 1986-1995 decade. Remarkably, 65 percent of community college stu-dents enrolled in the fall of 1995 were women, and 75 percent of all degrees conferred by com-munity colleges during the 1994-1995 year were earned by women. Over the long term, thefeminization of higher education may help close the rather substantial earnings gap that remainsbetween men and women in Kentucky. At the same time, it may be indicative of obstacles to par-ticipation among men that should be examined and systematically addressed.Incremental gains in minority enrollment were also made at the state's universities and com-munity colleges. Overall, black student enrollment increased 46 percent over the course of the1986-1995 decade, from 7,143 to 10,461 students. The portion of the student population com-prised of black students increased from 6 percent of those enrolled to 7 percent, which parallelsthe level of black population in the state. While gains in black enrollment are clearly positive, thesignificant economic disadvantage that persists in black communities around the state compelsconcerted attention to issues affecting minority enrollment.Significantly, higher education enrollment patterns in Kentucky have slowed somewhat in theearly 1990s. While some state universities have continued to make steady incremental gains,overall enrollment at state universities and the community colleges declined slightly following a1992-1993 peak. This downward turn in enrollment may be attributable to a diminishing popula-tion of college-age youth; the relative health of the economy, which is enabling broader partici-pation in the workforce; the economic insecurity that nevertheless attends today's economy anddiscourages the risk of investment in education; and the rising cost of tuition. Regardless of thecauses, a fuller understanding of the dynamics of higher education participation is critical in anera when educational attainment has become so strong a determinant of economic well-being.Discouraging Costs?Nationally, as well as in Kentucky, many point to skyrocketing tuition costs as a factor con-tributing to declining enrollments and discouraged students. Concern about tuition costs, whichhave outpaced and even doubled the rate of inflation in recent years, has reached its highest point I\u00b0 Dillman., D.A., Christenson, J.A., Salant, P., Warner, P.D.

Nationally, per student expenditures outpaced both the consumer priceindex and the higher education price index (HEPI), which is thought to be amore accurate meas-ure of the goods and services colleges must purchase. Over the period examined by the GAO,however, the HEPI accounted for only about three quarters of the 121 percent increase in per stu-dent expenditures.\"The GAO found that nationally the rising cost of instruction represented the largest portion(37.1 percent) of the $7,984 increase in per full-time-equivalent student costs over the periodexamined. In 1993-1994, faculty salaries and staff wages, which did not experience real growthuntil 1983, represented about 70 percent of average per student instruction costs.'5 Research (18.1percent) consumed the second largest share of the overall cost increase, and administration con-sumed the third largest share (16.2 percent).\" Nationally, the GAO found, administrative ex-penditures increased 131 percent or 41 percentage points more than the HEPI increased.\"In Kentucky, the Council on Higher Education notes in its annual statistical profile of decade-long trends in higher education that the largest increase in employment at state-supported insti-tutions over the most recent decade was in professional nonfaculty posts which increased 53 per-cent at state universities and 228 percent at the community colleges between the 1986 and the1995 fall semesters. By comparison, full-time faculty increased 12 percent at state universitiesand 60 percent at the community colleges. The GAO found that the rise in administrative andacademic support costs is generally attributed to intensifying recruitment efforts, expanded fi-nancial aid programs, computer support, and the management of cumbersome state and federalregulations. Interestingly, the portion of overall expenditures dedicated to instruction at Ken-tucky's state-supported institutions actually decreased from 29 percent of total spending to 28percent.In effect, state-supportedinstitutions of higher educa-tion around the nation havecontinued to spend at anescalatingpace,evenastheirprincipalsourceoffunding provided dwindlingshares of revenue.

Higher education: Tuition increasing faster than income and publiccolleges' costs.Washington, Government Printing 29.119 \" GAO, 30. 100Exploring the Frontier of the Future (47.8 percent) and health and human services (18.9 percent).\" Over the most recent decade,funding to state universities increased $246 million or 56 percent, from $441 million in 1985-1986 to $687 million in 1994-1995. At the same time, however, expenditures by the state's pub-licly supported institutions of higher education increased by $808 million or 87 percent, from$962.6 million in 1985 to $1.8 billion in 1994.The adaptive response to diminishing state responsibility for higher education revenues hasbeen one of cost-shifting rather than cost-cutting. Declining state contributions to higher educa-tion, as the GAO notes, have resulted in a substantial shift of the cost burden for running institu-tions of higher education to students. As the portion of higher education revenue provided by theKentucky state government declined, from 45 percent to 37 percent over the most recent decade,the portion of higher education revenue met by tuition and fees increased from 13 percent to 17percent. Overall, revenue generated from tuition increased 150 percent, from $123.7 million in1985-1986 to $309.4 million in 1994-1995. As a consequence, the ratio of general fund appro-priations to tuition changed substantially. Ten years ago, the state contributed $4 for every dollara student paid in tuition; today the state provides only about $2.50 for every student dollar.'9Federal dollars exclusive of student aid have also met an expanding share of higher educationrevenues in Kentucky, up from 9 percent in 1985-1986, to 11 percent in 1994-1995. Overall,federal funds to higher education in Kentucky rose $108,348 million or 126 percent.\" Deepercuts in the already slowing stream of federal funds could not only have an adverse long-term im-pact on revenue for Kentucky's university system but also on students, who, in the absence oforganizational responses to declining revenues, would likely assume part of the added cost bur-den in the form of higher tuition and fees. And, were federal student loan programs to be cut, asrecent congressional budget-cutting initiatives sought to do, the fiscal impact on state-supporteduniversities would be dramatic.Some, however, argue that federal student loan programs have effectively removed incentivesfor cost reductions and enabled institutions of higher education, public and private, to avoidpainful restructuring.\" Instead, institutions have simply shifted costs to students, a substantialportion of whom have ready access to federally backed loans. According to U.S. Department ofEducation surveys, 45.6 percent of all students at four-year public institutions in 1992-1993 re-ported receiving some type of financial aid.\" An earlier study by Sutter lin and Kominski at theU.S. Bureau of the Census found that more than half (51 percent) of the nation's 1990-1991 post-secondary students received financial aid from at least one source and that the average aid pack-age for the year stood at almost $3,000 per student.\" While the decline these surveys suggest maybe attributable to different survey methods, it also may be indicative of the level of discourage-ment rising tuition has engendered.As a consequence of rising tuition, federal outlays and debt burdens are mounting to recordand, some argue, unmanageable heights. Student financial aid, according to the College Board,has now reached an unbelievable $50 billion, an increasing portion of which is in long-termloans that translate into burdensome long-term debts.\" For many, these debts must be managedduring years in which earnings are low and, for young workers, declining.\" The costs are dis- 18 Schirmer, P., Childress, Center, Schirmer et al., 12.20 Schirmer et al.21 Fiske, E.B.

Because tuition meets only a portion of actual per student costs,some states have moved to discouragelonger periods of enrollment by increasing \"A college education should help the cost of tuition to those in programs forlonger than four years or by lowering people create a better future, not acredit requirements. But tuition costs, not deeply mortgaged future.\" malingering students, may be the factorthat most discourages timely completion of a degree. According to the National Center for Edu-cation Statistics, an estimated 46 percent of full-time college students aged 16 to 24 work,\"making it more difficult to manage a full course load. As students extend their length of enroll-ment, their debt burden mounts. Some poor students simply give up while others are so discour-aged they never apply.Today, the impact of rising tuition on access to publicly supported institutions of higher edu-cation is being broadly questioned. As Lemann observes in a Time magazine commentary, highereducation represents opportunity to citizens, \"the central American value?\"28 But the dramatic risein tuition at public universities has effectively \"changed the bargain between the citizen and thestate.\"\" It is a particularly questionable bargain in a state where incomes lag far behind U.S. av-erages and frequently reside near the bottom of national economic rankings. If, as some studiessuggest, the cost of tuition has reached a threshold at which it is blocking access to higher educa-tion, it is effectively inhibiting income growth, a consequence that Kentucky can ill afford.Data released by American College Testing (ACT) in July 1996 suggest that college studentsare discouraged nationally. Based on institutional data it has collected since 1983, ACT found thecollege dropout rate had reached its highest level in 13 years while the graduation rate had fallento its lowest level. Specifically, ACT found the freshman-to-sophomore dropout rate had risen to26.9 percent at all institutions, up 2.5 percentage points since 1983. While the increase is largelyattributable to rising dropouts from private institutions since 1993, the rate for public institutionsalso has been consistently higher over the years. Between 1983 and 1996, the portion of four-yearcollege students who graduated within five years decreased from 57.5 percent to 53.3 percent.\"ACT analysts have cited rising tuition rates as a key factor in these observed declines.In a 1995 RAND study of California's Master Plan for higher education, Shires concludesthat the state is experiencing \"an access crisis\" that is undermining the expressed mission ofpublicly supported higher education in the state.\" Rising levels of fees, Shires finds, are routinely\"pricing out students who . .. shouldbe served by the state's higher education sector.\" In effect,tuition hikes are essentially thwarting the plan's established goal of providing access to all whowould benefit from higher education. \"Unless the price of higher education is reduced to earlierlevels, the state will guarantee that a significant proportion of students will be denied access tothe state's public undergraduate institutions.\"\"Clearly, access to higher education is influenced by the supply and demand factors in individ-ual states. California faces the prospects of an exploding population and inadequate institutionalcapacity to meet a likely demand for higher education in the coming years. Future circumstances 26 Anonymous.

I 4) 1 102Exploring the Frontier of the Future are likely to be quite different here in Kentucky, given recent demographic trends, flattening en-rollments at public institutions, and an institutional capacity many would argue already gener-ously exceeds demand. Only through ongoing analyses of the factors influencing enrollment andaccess can the state effectively assess the real impact of the status quorising costs to studentsand taxpayers.Because a college degree has remained a sound investment over the years, parents and stu-dents met the rising cost of tuition without question for a time. In the absence of external pres-sure, institutions were not forced to reckon forcefully with issues of cost, efficiency orproductivity.\" But recent trends suggest that the near guarantee of an earnings return and theconsumer passivity it has engendered may be fading. Many parents, suggests futurist JosephCoates, are reacting to \"the 27-year-old Recent trends suggest that the near hulking over the refrigerator,\" still living atguarantee of an earnings return home and still jobless or marginally em-ployed in spite of substantial investment in and the consumer passivity it has higher education.\" Indeed, younger work-engendered may be fading. ers, particularly young men, have beenamong the biggest losers in our economy.And between 1994 and 2005, Bureau of Labor Statistics projections suggest job openings forcollege graduates could fall as much as 300,000 short of the number of college graduates enteringthe labor force.\" If these predictions and current trends hold, many college-educated entrants tothe labor force will work in low skill jobs at low pay. And public dissatisfaction with higher edu-cation will only grow.How Much is Enough?Analyses of Census data and state-level appropriations conducted by Illinois State Univer-sity's Center for Higher Education suggest that Kentucky's appropriations to higher educationare somewhat skewed in their relationship to the income capacity of the state's population. Giventhe significant educational ground we must close, it may, however, be far less than is needed. TheCenter's data show Kentucky is currently spending somewhat more for higher education than thenational median across two measures. Kentucky ranked 22nd in the nation, spending an esti-mated $176.93 per capita or more than $3 per person above the national median ($173.37).Kentucky's population is 24th in the nation. In another capacity measure, the Commonwealthranked 17th in the nation, spending $9.97 per $1,000 of personal income compared to a medianof $8.46.36Importantly, these data reflect myriad circumstances. They are indicative of the relative im-portance given to higher education in a state, the state's population and its wealth. Among thosestates spending above the median for higher education based on per capita income are some ofthe nation's poorest (Arkansas, Mississippi, New Mexico, and West Virginia), least populated(Hawaii and Delaware), and most committed to higher education. North Carolina, for example,ranks fifth in appropriations per capita and sixth in spending per $1,000 in personal income, aninvestment few would argue has not proven its worth. Conversely, states spending the least percapita tend to be populous, high-income states though there are exceptions. Consequently, it isdifficult to generalize about higher education spending relative to the capacity of a state's popu-lation. \"Finn and Manno, 5.34 Coates, J. (1996, July 14-17).

Grapevine,13.122 The Ivory Tower Under Siege 103 However, because we are spending beyond the capacity of our population, questions of qual-itywhat Kentuckians are getting for this substantial investmentbeg to be addressed. Manyargue that the Commonwealth has created far too many institutions with separate, costly andcompetitive administrations at the expense of quality. The state's doctoral institutions, the Uni-versity of Kentucky and the University of Louisville, it is argued, have been hindered in theirdevelopment due to the drain on resources. Conversely, others, including representatives of re-gional institutions, argue that both universities have failed to achieve programmatic excellence inspite of receiving the lion's share of resources. While quality is measured differently by differententities, how public money is spent and what taxpayers get for the substantial investment theymake in higher education are questions that compel the attention of policymakers.Leveraging Organizational ChangeClearly, the higher education community is experiencing unprecedented political pressure forfundamental change. Here in Kentucky, the Governor has made higher education reform a cen-tral focus of his administration. In response, political positions and turf are already being care-fully staked. Some argue that the community colleges should be severed from the University ofKentucky and reoriented to achieve a stronger focus on workplace skills. Others view Kentucky'sentire system of higher education as top-heavy and overextended, consuming too much revenuefor duplicative programs and for territorial institutional expansion in a state that is poor by vir-tually every traditional measure. As a result, it is argued, resources are diluted, and no institutionhas the capacity to achieve real excellence. In turn, the social and economic development that apremiere institution might enable remain illusive. In short, Rollin J. Watson, President of Somer-set Community College asserts, \"Kentucky does not need and cannot afford eight universities.\"\"Certainly, anticipated gains for higher education over the coming biennium will not close lostfiscal ground, and the future is unlikely to yield significant increases in public outlays. In an ex-ploration of the impact of larger trends on the state's budget, Schirmer, Childress and Nett findthat in order to maintain the present quality of state programs, expenditures will exceed revenueswithin a few short years, resulting in a structural deficit.\" Consequently, it is unlikely that Ken-tucky will achieve improvements in higher education through increased expenditures.The logical response to mounting fiscal pressures and public demands for change is for insti-tutions of higher education to engage in systemic, organizational change. Higher education maybe \"years away from knowing what academic versions of TQM (Total Quality Management) willappropriately look like,\"39 as Marchese suggested in 1993, but the urgency that propels it appearsto have arrived. The values of processes like TQM offer a solid foundation on which institution-ally unique initiatives can be developed. Arguably, adoption of the ethic of continuous improve-ment alone would dramatically alter higher education. Equally important, however, are thecritical goals of reorienting higher education institutions toward their \"customers\"students,working adults, businesses, and the public in generaland tapping the full potential of criticalhuman resources, of faculty and staff, who, given the authority to do so, can help shape a moreresponsive, more efficient system of management and instruction. The ideal outcome, Marchesesuggests, is \"to remake organizations so they become more focused, disciplined, quick-footed,humane, and competitive.\"40Ironically, the push to cultivate \"learning organizations\" in the private sector also offers animportant and a new focus for many institutions of higher education. As Garvin suggests, alearning organization is \"skilled at creating, acquiring, and transferring knowledge, and atmodifying its behavior to reflect new knowledge and insights.'\"' The stringent test Garvin poses \" Watson, R.J. (1996, October 30). Joining the branches of higher education. Lexington Herald-Leader,p. A9.38 Schirmer et al.39 Marchese, T. (1993, for ideas. Change, 25,10.\u00b0 Marchese.41 Garvin, D.C. (1993, July/August). Building a learning organization. Harvard Business Review,80. 104Exploring the Frontier of the Future for a learning organization is that of \"changing the way work gets done.\" Too often, tradition-laden universities and colleges simply would not pass.For state policymakers, the central questions around higher education are those of how muchexternal pressure will be required to spur systemic change within the higher education commu-nity, and what, if anything, policymakers can do to leverage it sooner as opposed to later. Somestates have exerted pressure by making dramatic, across-the-board cuts, rather than adopting theprevailing incremental approach. Others, like Kentucky, have put performance standards inplace, but because the bottom-line stakes are negligible, they do not appear to be spurring dra-matic change in any state. Regardless of the impetus, broad-based ,institutional commitment toorganizational change is arguably the only viable response to new fiscal realities and rising citi-zen dissatisfaction. Policymakers face the difficult challenge of encouraging and rewarding suchfundamental change in the long-term interests of citizens of the Commonwealth.ConclusionClearly, citizen dissatisfaction with the cost and the quality of higher education is creatingunprecedented pressure for fundamental change on campuses around the nation. As a conse-quence, policymakers here and in many states have begun to probe higher education expendi-tures, policies and practices, and to experiment broadly in an effort to leverage fundamentalchange. But reforming higher education may be the most difficult political challenge before poli-cymakers. While frequently cautioned about the error of attempting to micromanage higher edu-cation institutions, policymakers are simultaneously told that higher education is perhaps theleast prepared of all public institutions to manage restructuring and change. Consequently, bal-ancing the interests of citizens with those of institutions poses a formidable challenge.Indeed, the recent history of higher education has been one of expansion and growth, even inthe face of dwindling shares of revenue from state governments. Though the growth in highereducation expenditures is attributable to rising enrollment, many argue that the time has come forhigher education to do more with less and to do things far differently. Among other things, theypoint to the drift of higher education expenditures toward a range of nonacademic studentamenities, to bloated administrations, to costly remedial help for poorly prepared students, and tosenior faculty who teach few courses and produce little meaningful research.Importantly, engagement in organizational change could prove to be a revolutionary boon forhigher education, creating whole new markets and enlivening the education process as neverbefore. Indeed, studies show that interactive computer learning not only enables students to retainmore information but to learn more quickly.\" Outcomes, however, will ultimately depend on theenergy and the sincerity of commitment institutions bring to the challenge. It is one of containingcosts, of capturing higher levels of efficiency and productivity from faculty and staff, of unleash-ing the considerable talents of those on the frontlines of higher education, of streamlining man-agement processes, of becoming far more sensitive to the needs of customers, of securing realreturns from investments in technology, and of improving competitive position in ways thatmatter to students and citizens.\" In short, cost and quality matter a great deal, even at the top ofthe Ivory Tower. Until these fundamental issues are systematically addressed, the current climateis unlikely to change for higher education. r) 442 Oblinger, D.G. (n.d.).

Workforce Training Issues The importance of a skilled and highly educated workforce to economic well-being is widely recog-nized, and the relationship between skills and income is becoming stronger over time. Largely as a result ofgrowing demand for skilled workers, state-level training programs are becoming increasingly important ascomplements to federal programs. Although the demand for workers with a bachelor's degree or more isgrowing rapidly, many future workers will not attend college and will require other types of training. Cost-sharing for worker training and improved communication between businesses and students will help facili-tate the transition from school to work. The needs of older workers are also important, as the relative sizeof the workforce aged 45-64 will grow. Finally, small and rural firms may need some special assistance inmodernizing, because the difficulty of finding highly trained workers may preclude investment in advancedtechnology. By Stephan J. GoetzUniversity of KentuckyThe nation's concern over workforce training is succinctly summarized by the title of a1990 report from the National Center on Education and the Economy, America's Choice:High Skills or Low Wages!

How-ever, an improved method of calculating the index, which will be used in future official calcula-tions by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, reveals a different picture.' This improved measure,which takes into account annual output price changes, reveals that average productivity hasgrown by only 1.1 annually since 1973, suggesting effects of computers on average (economy-wide) labor productivity growth have been limited. At the same time, earnings of individualswith higher skills and advanced training have been increasing relative to the earnings of indi-viduals with fewer skills and less training. Thus, the premium paid to workers with more traininghas been rising over time.State-Level ResponsesNot surprisingly, while the availability of low cost labor was the primary locational criterionfor many firms in 1980, according to one survey, that criterion had fallen to fifth place in theearly 1990s. It was replaced by the availability of a well qualified and highly productive work-force as the top criterion.' Largely as a result of growing demand for skilled workers, combinedwith declining federal involvement, state-level training programs are becoming increasingly im-portant as complements to federal programs such as JTPA or JOBS.'State-level training programs can provide custom-tailored and flexible training alternativesfor local economic development. A 1990 survey by the National Center for Research in Voca-tional Education found that 47 states had at least one worker training program created andfunded by state government. Some programs had been created as recently as the late 1980s. Oth-ers, particularly in the South, had begun as early as the 1960s, although many were established inthe 1980s.5State training and technical assistance programs are losing their traditional roles of servingprimarily for industrial recruitment purposes. Instead, they are also used to retain and expandexisting businesses, by allowing local firms to become more competitive.6 Training programsvary as to which firms are eligible, how much is spent and from each source, and how, by whomand for how long the training is provided and the services offered. Southern states generally pro-vide direct training to firms, rather than compensate firms that provide their own training.'Under \"third wave\" economic development principles, firms are increasingly asked to sharethe cost of job training (as well as other state-provided services) as evidence that the service isneeded.' Referring to potential new firms as \"customers\" of state government services, Mattoonwrites, \"[fiundamental to third wave principles is to make certain that customer demand drivesprogram design and objectives.\"' The requirement that firms share in the cost of providingtraining ensures that programs are discontinued once they are no longer needed.

In Japan, larger firms work closely with local schools to identifypromising graduates and these firms interact with schools in much the same way as with otherinput suppliers, continuously seeking to improve the quality of the inputs or resources employed.In the United States, many of the high schoOl graduates or dropouts seeking to directly enter thelabor force flounder for up to 10 years in low skill, minimum wage jobs to gain the experienceand work habits demanded by employers willing and able to pay higher wages for longer term, \"adult jobs?\"'The system of school-to-work transition for adolescents who are not college-bound is consid-erably less formalized and effective in the United States than in Europe and Japan, despite a longhistory of federal legislation designed to improve the workforce readiness of adolescents and thearticulation of labor supply and demand.\" The southern states of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi,South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia recently used the Jobs for America's Graduates programto raise high school completion rates and improve the employment prospects of disadvantagedyouth.'

The rate of apprentices per 1,000 workers in the labor force has decreased tounder 2.5 in 1992 since 1949, when the rate peaked at 3.8.4' The apprenticeship system has alsohistorically not attracted large numbers of minorities and women trainees, who are forecast toconstitute a large share of new entrants into the labor force by the year 2000.42 Kentucky ranked43rd out of 50 states in 1991 in apprenticeships per worker and experienced a decline of almost 5in the number of positions between 1987 and 1991. Fewer than 2 of all high school graduatesnow receive apprenticeship training; moreover, they represent only 0.2 of the U.S. workforce.\"McDonalds Corp., which employs more than one in ten teenagers nationwide, recently initiatedan apprenticeship program, \"not to consign kids to fast-food or, other low level careers but tomake the workplaces they're already in as learning-oriented as possible.

Work-based learning programs are formal, structured, and strategically organ-ized by instructional staff, employers, and sometimes other groups to link learning in theworkplace to students' college-based learning experiences. Work-based learning pro-grams have formal instructional plans that directly relate students' work-based learningactivities to their career goals . ..Instructional programs that involve youth apprentice-ships, clinical experiences, school-based enterprises, and formal registered apprentice-ships are examples of work-based learning programs.\u00b0Alternatively, Hoerner defines WBL programs as \"[t]he knowledge/learning imparted to everystudent from the beginning of schooling that maintains a theme or focus that people work in or-der to live and that there is a positive 'connectedness' between the schooling process and produc-tive lives.' Already, numerous examples of formal and informal collaborative arrangements,designed to improve the transition of young workers into the workplace, exist between privatebusinesses and public schools including the Louisville Education and Employment Partnership.\"But, the number of students involved remains small,\" and many programs tend to be superficial.3\u00b0Conclusion. The general conclusion from this discussion is that the free market system hasdifficulty articulating the supply of and demand for the specific types of skills needed by theworkers who do not eventually graduate from college. Lack of information, which in turn leads tohigh transaction costs between buyers and sellers (in this case of labor services), is a classic rea-son why markets sometimes fail to allocate resources effectively. This appears to be the case heretoo: employers are unable to size up high school graduates because of the unreliable informationconveyed by a diploma, and high school graduates have limited knowledge of employers' expec-tations in terms of the skills they need to possess. The problem also has elements of a Catch-22situation: firms fail to adopt new, productivity-enhancing technologies because skilled workersare not available, and workers do not invest in the skills because firms fail to adopt the technolo-gies. Thus, it is common for newspapers to write about employers unable to find skilled andqualified workers in the local labor market, even in the presence of high local unemploymentrates.Future TrainingNeedsKrugman cautionsthat\"technologicaladvance... does notalwaysincreasetheneedforskilledla-bor\" thedemand for such work-ers,particularlyinFIGURE 12.4Projected Employment by Education & Training, Year 2005 1st \"MDoctor's of Statistics10152025303540Percent 46 Bragg and Hamm.

One answer to this question is provided by the Bureau of LaborStatistics (BLS), which attempts to forecast growth of the workforce by education and trainingcategory (Figure 12.4).\" According to these estimates, 60.9 percent out of the 145 million esti-mated total jobs in the year 2005 will require some form of on-the-job training, down from 62.7percent of all jobs in 1994. Nearly two out of five jobs in the year 2005 will require only short-term on-the-job training. The relative demand for employees with postsecondary vocationaltraining is forecast to decline by 0.2 percentage points (from 5.6 to 5.4), while the demand foremployees having only work experience is expected to drop by 0.1 percentage points (from 7.9 to7.8). PercentSource: Labor these numbers istocalculate for each educa-tional attainment categorythe expected relative in-creaseinemploymentnumbers due to job growth(Figure 12.5). This analy-sis shows that the demandfor individuals with Mas-ter's degrees (29) is ex-pectedtogrowmostrapidly in relative terms,followedbyBachelor's(27) and Associate's (24)degreeholders,respec-tively. The smallest rela-tive in to occur foron-the-job training (long-and moderate-term) and postsecondary vocational training. Even so, because the number of posi-tions requiring short-term on-the-job training is so large (Figure 12.4), the absolute increase inthis category will dominate employment growth in the other educational categories. The secondlargest absolute increase in demand (after short-term on-the-job training) is forecast to occur forworkers with Bachelor's degrees. Their share of all employees is estimated to increase from 11.0to 12.3 (or 3.8 million individuals).Implications and Issues for KentuckyThe Kentucky Educational Reform Act of 1990 (KERA) provides a potential basis for devel-oping a first-class, internationally competitive workforce in the state; the reform goals are inmany ways consistent with high-performance (HP) workplace principles.\" Spending per pupiland teacher salaries in Kentucky are converging on national averages under KERA (Figure 12.6), 52 Bailey, T. (1991, March). Jobs of the future and the education they will require: Evidence from occupational forecasts. Edu-cational Researcher, 20, 11-20.33 See also Kuttner, R. (1996, June 17). Is worker training really the answer? Business Week, 26.34 See Bailey (1991) for a discussion of the limitations of such forecasts.55 As DeYoung suggests, however, some groups (social meliorists) would argue that elements of KERA designed to preparestudents to be socially and economically productive members of the workforce \"primarily enhance the mindless economicdevelopment trajectories of a culture losing touch with human and community needs.\" See DeYoung. Whose KERA is it any-way? p. 4.132 Workforce Training Issues 113 although they remain below those averages.\" Given the fact that per capita income in the state in1994 was only 81.7 percent of the national average, Kentucky is spending proportionally moreper pupil and in terms of teacher salary than would be predicted on the basis of income alone.Yet, the only way in which the state can ever hope to raise income levels to or above the nationalaverage may be through even greater investments in education. Companies such as Lexmark,Square-D and Toyota Motor Manufacturing are proof that Kentucky firms and workers canswitch to modern, post-Taylorist management techniques and be both nationally and interna-tionally competitive.A number of important activities are underway in the state to improve the transition of highschool students into the workforce. Here it is possible only to provide a brief synopsis of some ofthese efforts. The state's School-to-Work program has the goal of helping \"students become wellprepared for the workplace by:Involving parents in helping children select a career goalBlending school based learning with work based learningProviding students with the opportunity to select a career major or an occupationalclusterBringing schools and businesses together to provide high quality, work based learningexperiencesEmphasizingthepracticalapplicationofknowledgethroughintegratedschool/business educational programs of high quality, work based learning expert=ences\"\"Asageneralprinciple,theSchool-to-Workprogramreliesheavily on local partnerships among\"employers, labor, schools, parents,community, and government.\" It isbased on contextual or work basedlearning,itintegratesworkplacecompetencies into the school curricu-lum and attempts to raise academicstandards by providing a strong focuson careers. In Kentucky efforts arealso devoted to developing \"commonlanguages\" between educators andbusinesses, and creating a system ofskills standards as well as skill certi-fication. The state is launching ini-tiatives in this regard using a SkillsStandards Advisory Board.One-Stop Career Centers are another attempt to improve the functioning of labor markets inKentucky and elsewhere in the nation, by integrating the large number of training/employmentprograms available into a single system.

Indeed,cynics might point out that average SAT scores nationwide fell from just under 960 in 1967 to 900 in 1992 even as real perpupil expenditures more than doubled from $2,500 to $5,500.

Furthermore, the U.S. spends more per pupil than any of its industrial com-petitors at the primary and secondary levels (U.S. Bureau of the Census, Table 1370), and yet apparently fails to provide com-parable levels of education. .57 Kentucky Department of Education.

School-to-work133 114Exploring the Frontier of the Future tion clearinghouses for both employers and workers, with the goal of reducing transaction costsinvolved in articulating labor supply and demand.The Kentucky Tech(nology) System consists of schools that provide secondary and postsecon-dary training in the vocational-technical area. The system makes available customized trainingfor new and existing businesses, and also provides worker assessment services, including \"careerinventories, interest inventories, psychomotor skills and academic potential as well as prehireassessment.\"\" Presently, Tech Prep programs are offered at over 111 sites in the state. Thesefour-year programs lead to diplomas or associate degrees in technical-vocational areas, and rep-resent an alternative to college preparation courses, starting in high school with the 11th grade.The State of Kentucky provides training funds to businesses through the Bluegrass State SkillsCorporation, under the auspices of the Cabinet for Economic Development.At present relatively little is known about the cost-effectiveness of the various training pro-grams operated within the state, and the total number of students or workers affected. For exam-ple, data on numbers of students benefiting from School-to-Work programs and variouspartnerships in different parts of the state (including rural areas) are not readily available. Simi-larly, information is generally not available on how long workers trained under the Tech Prepprogram remain in their jobs, what their earnings would be with and without the training, etc.Research is needed to shed light on the returns to these programs, and which aspects of the dif-ferent training programs work well and could be used in other areas of the state, or in other pro-grams. Furthermore, it would be valuable to compare the cost of a skills standard system with thecost of the worker assessment services provided by the Kentucky Tech System. Also, to determinewhere tax dollars should be spent so as to maximize returns to taxpayers, it would be important toknow the relative costs and benefits of spending more on students now in high school, as opposedto training them later in their lives at public expense within different careers.In this context, the following trends and issues are likely to be of particular importance toKentucky over the next decade.A. To the extent that Kentucky's demographic structure follows that of the U.S. South, thestate will experience a small net decline in the population aged 20-45 years between 1993 and2010, and a sizable increase in \"mature workers\" who will require additional training to partici-pate effectively in the new economy.6\u00b0 This is driven in part by an increased focus on qualitystandards and skills certificates in the workplace. Training institutions and firms will need toupgrade the skills of existing, \"mature\" workers and this re-education will likely include ex-panded training of adults in colleges, universities and technical schools. Another group of work-ers whose training needs may warrant further attention is that of adolescents who have droppedout of high school and, in some cases, the workforce.An important unresolved issue in this regard is also, who bears the cost of this training (i.e.,the private and/or the public sector), and should the training be in terms of general or firm-specific skills (i.e., in terms of skills that are useful only to the firm) or skills that would be of useto the worker even if the firm later ceases to operate? It appears that public-private partnershipswill become increasingly important in the future to ensure that effective training programs areavailable for workers, and to help facilitate the transition of adolescents into the workforce.B. Primary, secondary and postsecondary schools increasingly need to lay a foundation for thethree L's of education demanded in the new economy, lifelong learning, or \"learning to earn,\" inaddition to teaching core fundamentals of reading, writing and arithmetic 61 In addition, greaterattention may need to be paid to entrepreneurship training. According to a 1995 Gallup Po11,62 59 Kentucky Cabinet for Economic Development. (1995).

Vocational Education Journal, 35 ff.134 Workforce TrainingIssues115 nearly 70 percent of high school graduates nationwide were interested in starting their own busi-nesses but lacked information about the process.C. Unlike the nation as a whole, Kentucky remains a relatively rural state. More than one halfof the state's population lives in rural areas, compared with less than one quarter in the nation asa whole. Recent research suggests that small manufacturers in rural areas have lower adoptionrates of new technologies than their urban counterparts, in part because smaller firms havegreater difficulty finding skilled workers;\".\" thus, the Catch-22 problem of investment in ad-vanced training by workers and adoption of modern technology by firms is likely even more pro-nounced in rural areas. Government decisionmakers in Kentucky should not ignore small ruralfirms as a dynamic source of economic growth, and should consider devoting additional re-sources to helping these enterprises modernize (for example, through information networks forentrepreneurs, by fostering ties between firms, universities, community colleges and technicalschools, encouraging more apprenticeship and vocational training, etc.). A related challenge is tobreak the existing connection between low school achievement and high rates of poverty in somerural and urban districts.\"Summary and ConclusionBy way of summary, the following concerns are likely to be of particular importance to Ken-tucky over the next decade:A significant increase in the relative size of the workforce aged 45-64 and the atten-dant training needs of those workersThe need to improve workforce preparation of adolescents, both in and out of theworkforce, recognizing that not all will necessarily work in high-performance jobsDeveloping institutions and arrangements for sharing of training costs by firms toimprove on-the-job training and productivityThe problems associated with moving an economy from mass manufacturing to one that relieson highly skilled workers who produce high quality and custom-tailored goods and servicesshould not be underestimated. Furthermore, while social returns to investments in education tosociety have been universally shown to greatly exceed the costs, the benefits do not accrue im-mediately and a long-term perspective is essential. In Kentucky the payoffs in terms of higherpersonal incomes and state tax revenues to investing in the skills of the existing workforce, facili-tating the transition of youth into the workforce, and creating a culture of lifelong learning, willlikely more than compensate for the costs of these activities. 63Wirth.Education and work for the year 2000: choices we face.64 Rosenfeld, S.

Local economic conditions and KERA.1 25 Section IIIOur Changing Economy Around the beginning of the 20th century, the U.S. economy was undergoing a significanttransformation. As industrial technology such as the electric dynamo (which had beeninvented about 30 years earlier) reached maturity, huge electric generators were illumi-nating cities at night and running heavy equipment in factories while typewriters, addressingmachines, Dictaphones, mimeograph machines and other equipment were appearing in officesfor the first time. Yet productivity growth was sluggish, manufacturing wages were stagnant,capitalistsnot workerswere taking an increasing share of total income, and the wage gap waswidening between education \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" What happened next is remarkable.Manufacturers introduced countless products that saved time, increased mobility, and raised thestandard of living. Prices were low enough to make these products available to the vast majorityof Americans, jobs were plentiful (with the notable exception of the Great Depression), and wagedifferences between workers at different education levels narrowed or stayed the same.At the end of the 20th century we find ourselves in a situation remarkably similar to that ofour compatriots 100 years ago. The computer has been around for at least 40 years and the mi-croprocessorthe \"computer within a computer\" for 25 years, and we are only beginning torealize their potential applications. Robots and computers have found practical applications in thefactory; fax machines, pagers, and PCs (personal computers) have been in wide use for at least adecade. But productivity growth has been very slow since the 1970s, and far below the standardfor most of the century. Labor's share of national income is falling, and the wage gap betweeneducation \"haves\" and \"have nots\" is widening.Will the coming decades mirror the growth and prosperity of the 20th century? Futurist DavidPearce Snyder thinks so. Citing a Stanford University report entitled Computer and Dynamo: TheModern Productivity Paradox in a Not Too Distant Mirror, Pearce notes that in the past, newtechnologies have not spurred immediate economic growth, but have, over the long run, helpedbring tremendous increases in productivity, wages, and the standard of living. Snyder's conclu-sion: \"By 2010 to 2015, the United States will become a mature information-intensive economyand surpass the levels of general prosperity and upward mobility experienced during the 1950sand 1960s... The new integrated information technology . .. is about to avalanche into all ofour homes and workplaces, enriching and complicating daily life for everybody.\"'Others are equally optimistic. The Wall Street Journal: \"Changes in technology, trade andeducation would boost the fortunes of most Americans ...Broader computer use would makeworkers more productive, more in demand and able to command higher salaries. And growingcollege enrollment would shrink the gap between the wealthy and middle classes.\"2 The Econo-mist: Information technology will cause \"enormous investment and growth opportunities for theeconomy as a whole\" and will create more jobs than it destroys.' Business Week: \"Today's high-tech productivity bonanza will have a double-barreled impact on living standards ...When thepayoff comes, the wait will have been more than worth it.'On the other hand, different outcomes are possible, too.

Common to all points of view is the be-lief that computers and other information and communications technology will cause a funda-mental restructuring of not just the economy, but our way of life. Second, most believe that thenext several years, at the very least, may be uncertain, uncomfortable, even tumultuous, as theeconomy adopts new technologies and new business practices. Third, there is at least a hint ofoptimism in most predictions, even among people who believe job loss is likely. Rifkin himselfholds the hope that all people will eventually share in the benefits of the digital age, with lesstime spent at work and more on community development and other projects outside the marketeconomy.Many of these themes are reflected in the following chapters. Stephan Goetz and PeterSchirmer begin with a broad overview in two chapters which discuss changes in the state's indus-tries and occupations, particularly with an eye on the effects of technological advancement. Theyalso raise some of the issues related to our present economic transformation: stagnant manufac-turing wages, corporate restructuring and downsizing, and a widening wage gap between high-and low-skill workers. Next are closer examinations of two important Kentucky industriescoaland tobacco. Gerald Weisenfluh, James Cobb, John Ferm, and Carol Ruthven see the potentialfor new market opportunities for coal, but new processing techniques and a better understandingof Kentucky's coal resources will be necessary before we can take advantage of these new oppor-tunities. Will Snell predicts that while the structure of tobacco farming will change, tobacco willcontinue to be a viable economic sector as a result of growing international markets combinedwith a domestic market which is only declining gradually.Has economic change wrought uncertainty? Michal Smith-Mello sees the social contract be-tween employer and employee becoming far less favorable for workers, creating income inequi-ties, critical gaps in health and retirement provisions, and, some argue, structural, unemployment.Amitabh Chandra reports that income inequality has worsened, and this trend is more severe inKentucky than in the rest of the nation. Possible explanations include demographic trends, thedecline in unionization, and technological progress, which rewards highly skilled labor andplaces abundant low-skill labor at a comparative disadvantage in the global economy.At the same time, though, tremendous new economic opportunities are emerging. Dick Dedicidentifies five technology product areas, or areas for applied scientific research, which have themost potential for innovation and expansion within Kentucky: telecommunications, life sciencetechnology, biotechnology, material design, and environmental remediation. Chris Sauer notesthat Kentucky has benefited from foreign investment in the state, particularly by Japanese firms_Moreover, global trade is growing, bringing with it new challenges, of course, but also offeringnew markets for a variety of Kentucky products. With regard to agricultural exports, MichaelReed believes that Kentucky is well positioned to take advantage of increased trade opportunitiesfor raw and semiprocessed products. But the real growth is in value-added, processed products,and the food processing industry in Kentucky is not fully developed.This section concludes with two chapters on the infrastructure that forms the foundation ofthe economy. Ted Grossardt sees the dispersion of manufacturing and service industries as amajor issue affecting our transportation system. Nonmetropolitan transportation is becomingmore important, and transportation, like virtually everything else, will be affected by advancinginformation technologies. Doug Robinson examines the possible effects of information technol-ogy in closer detail. Access to the information network, privacy, security and computer literacybring new challenges to the public and private sectors. Indeed, information technology may bringfundamental changes to our social fabric. It certainly will affect the economy. 5 Rifkin, J. (1995, May-June).

Yet employment inKentucky has not shifted to the services-producing sector nearly as quickly as it has in other states. Ken-tucky still has a relatively large percentage of its workforce in goods-producing industries. Employment inapparel, primary metals and motor vehicles has grown especially quickly relative to the rest of the nation.Kentucky's urban counties have had more employment growth overall, but rural counties have had muchmore growth in manufacturing employment. Counter to national trends, service sector earnings in Ken-tucky remain considerably below those in manufacturing, but the gap is narrowing, if slowly. The state'slow rate of proprietorship formation and stagnant manufacturing wages are concerns. Identifying trainingand employment options for low-skilled workers displaced by technological advance in the services sectormay become a key challenge facing policymakers in the next century. By Stephan J. GoetzUniversity of KentuckyPeter SchirmerKentucky Long-Term Policy Research CenterThe U.S. economy experienced two fundamental transformations in the last 200 years.First, technological change in agriculture (as well as forestry and mining) and growth inmass production led to a massive out-migration of workers from extractive to goods-producing industries, in the process converting society from an agrarian to an industrial base.The industrial revolution would not have proceeded as rapidly as it did without the ready avail-ability of workers coming off farms. That only a small share of today's workforce meets all of thefood needs of this country is a hallmark of economic development, one admired by other coun-tries throughout the world. Second, the advent of computer-driven, numerical control processesfundamentally transformed the goods-producing (manufacturing) sector, with a similar substitu-tion of technology for human labor as had occurred earlier in farming. As manufacturing workerswere released from factories, they found employment in a booming new sector: services.Technological change, along with improvements in human and biological capital, as well aslegal institutions, has traditionally been one of the main sources of economic growth. It led firstto the release of labor out of agriculture into manufacturing and then from manufacturing intoservices. These shifts give rise to the question: Will technological change eventually lead to asimilar release of workers out of the services sector and, if so, to which sector(s)? Or have em-ployers in the service sector already exploited most of the gains possible from technologicalchange?At present, employment in the service-producing sector is expanding rapidly, although not allindustries within the sector are affected equally. The banking industry, for example, is expectedto reduce employment levels significantly over the next decade. But even as technology reducesthe demand for labor in banking, it may increase the demand for labor in computer services. Asthe industrial structure of a dynamic market economy changes, occupational demands, skill re-quirements, wages, benefits, and the length and stability of employment also change. 138 120Exploring the Frontier of the FutureKentucky/U.S. TrendsTotal full- and part-time employment in Kentucky, including wage and salary and proprietorjobs, grew by 735,000 jobs between 1969 and 1994, from 1.33 to 2.06 million jobs.' Thus, forevery 100 jobs that existed in 1969, 55 net new jobs were created in the state between 1969 and1994. In comparison, the U.S. economy generated 59 new jobs per 100 jobs in 1969. While therate of increase in wage and salary jobs in Kentucky (61 percent) exceeded the national increase(55 percent), the increase in proprietorships in the state (34 percent) was significantly less thanthe national increase (87 percent). If the number of proprietorships in Kentucky had grown at thenational rate, total job growth in the state would have been higher by about 138,000 jobs (19 per-cent) over this 25-year period. The high rate of proprietorship growth relative to wage and salarygrowth nationwide may largely reflect recent downsizing in corporations.'Kentucky is experiencing a boom in services employment similar to that occurring nation-wide: In the last 25 years, the services' sector alone accounted for 4 out of every 10 new full- andpart-time private jobs created in the state. The more broadly defined service-producing sector,which includes the service sector as well as transportation, communications and public utilities(TCPU); retail-wholesale trade; and finance, insurance and retail estate (FIRE)services, ac-counted for more than 8 out of every 10 new jobs.Yet the well documented shift underway, from extractive and goods-producing industries tothe services sector, has been slightly less pronounced in Kentucky than in the nation (Table13.1). Employment was more heavily concentrated in extractive industries in the state in 1994than was the case nationally in 1969, and the decline in goods-producing employment over thatperiod was considerably lower in Kentucky (4.0 percentage points) than nationally (9.3 percent-age points).TABLE 13.1Composition of the U.S. and Kentucky 5.1%2.7%13.1%7.0%Goods-producing (secondary) 27.5%18.2%24.8%20.8%All Services (tertiary) 67.4%79.1%62.2%72.2%Total 100%100%100%100%No. (in thousands) 90,878144,3911,3282,063Note: Extractive includes farming and mining; goods-producing includes construction and manu-facturing; and services consists of all other sectors, including agricultural services, fisheries andforestry.Source: Authors' calculations using Dept. of Commerce REIS data.One wayofinterpretingthedata in Table 13.1is that de-velop a economy,since a share of itslabor force is em-ployed in the \"oldeconomy\" (primary and secondary sectors). A different interpretation is that decisionmakers inKentucky have deliberately sought to attract new and existing manufacturing employment fromelsewhere in the nation into the state as a basis for generating long-term economic wealth. Manyobservers view some of these manufacturing sectors, such as motor vehicle parts production andassembly, as being on the cutting edge of modem industrial processes, including the intensive useof information technologies, total quality management (TQM) principles, and customer respon-siveness. The data are obtained from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, Regional Economic InformationSystem (REIS). This particular source was chosen, even though it contains data only through 1994, because it allows abreakdown of trends by urban and rural areas. These are the number of jobs estimated to exist in Kentucky; some of the jobsmay be held by residents of bordering states, while some Kentuckians commute to jobs in neighboring states. The available datado not allow us to distinguish between the number of jobs held by Kentuckians as opposed to out-of-state residents.2 See, for example, Beyers, W. B. (1996, April). Trends in producer services growth in the rural heartland. In Economic forcesshaping the rural heartland. Kansas City, KA: Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.3 This sector includes: hotels and other lodging places; private botanical,zoological gardens; membership organizations; engineering and management services; and miscellaneous services. 1- Industry Trends: Jobs and Earnings 121 Also, according to Commerce Department (RIMS II) estimates, the motor vehicle assemblyindustry has high employment and earnings multipliers. This means that each new job and dollarearned in that industry in Kentucky is associated with the creation of a significant number of newjobs and additional earnings in the state. For example, when the Toyota manufacturing plant inGeorgetown hires additional workers to increase the production of Camrys, other jobs are createdin Kentucky in the satellite plants which supply Toyota with parts (such as car seats, plasticparts, electronic engine components, etc.). Furthermore, when the newly hired workers spendtheir income on food, shelter and clothing, even more jobs are created as a result in the state. InKentucky, only forestry and fishery products and food manufacturing have higher employmentmultipliers than the auto assembly industry.'Employment growth in motor vehicle parts production is only one example of the shifts inemployment in Kentucky's industrial base. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) identifies threemajor sources of employment growth or decline in an industry: 9Changes in the demand for the industry's productoChanges in technologyoChanging employment practices of business'Examples of the latter include (domestic and international) outsourcing and hiring of temporaryworkers. In the subsequent analysis, we examine employment trends in the following major in- FIGURE 13.1Growth in Extractive & Goods-Producing JobsKentucky and the United States, 1969-1994 FarmAg.

Washington, DC: ExecutiveOffice of the President.1.40 122Exploring the Frontier of the Future Agricultural services' were by far the most rapidly growing industry out of 10 industry divisionsin the state. With a 411 percent net increase, jobs in this industry expanded at almost three timesthe rate of general service sector jobs (131 percent). In comparing these numbers, it is importantto note that the 1969 employment level in agricultural services (4,000) was considerably less thanin services (217,000). Even so, 185 net new jobs were created in agricultural services nationwidefor every 100 farm proprietorships lost between 1969 and 1994. More generally, as a result ofmajor demographic shifts toward dual-career and single-person households, as well as increasesin income which raise the cost of time, the demand for convenience and processed foods has ex-panded rapidly. Not coincidentally, food- and fiber-related industries today employ nearly 1 outof 5 U.S. workers.Limited or even negative growth in mining employment reflects both reduced reliance on coalas a source of energy and the effect of labor-saving technological change. Growth in constructionemployment in Kentucky was less than the national average. Statewide manufacturing employ-ment increased 24 percent between 1969 and 1994, which is remarkable when contrasted withthe 7 percent national decline. In 1969, manufacturing accounted for 19 percent of all jobs inKentucky, compared with 15 percent in 1994. The corresponding percentages for the nation are23 percent in 1969 and 13 percent in 1994.Relative to the nation, employment growth in Kentucky has also been more rapid in TCPUand wholesaling and retailing, and less rapid in FIRE and services (Figure 13.2). The result forTCPU may in part reflect higher effective demand for utilities such as communications, electric-ity, and sanitary services as lower-income areas of the state caught up with service levels na-tionwide. Also, the communications sector is expanding and modernizing rapidly in Kentucky.The state's advantageous location relative to national population centers may in part explain thehigher-than-average growth in transportation and wholesaling. 160FIGURE 13.2Growth in 80a)2a)o_40 TCPUWholesaleSource: Data from U.S. Department of Commerce REISRetailFIREServices In Kentucky and the nation, services had the largest numerical increase in employment. Theservice industry added 283,000 new jobs (in net terms) in Kentucky, more than doubling em-ployment between 1969 and 1994. The retail sector had the second largest increase, adding171,000 new jobs. Public sector employment rose by 31 percent in Kentucky and by 34 percentnationally. Services, retailing, and the public sector accounted for nearly three fourths of the735,000 net new jobs created in the state between 1969 and 1994. 7 This industry includes soil preparation, crop, veterinary, animal, farm labor, farm management, landscape and horticulturalservices, in addition to forestry, fishing, hunting and trapping-related services.1 41 Industry Trends: Jobs and Earnings 123 The service-producing sector has apparently not yet felt the full impact on employment of theinformation revolution embodied in new computer technologies.' A glimpse of the potential fu-ture effect of such a revolution on certain parts of the economy is provided by the retail bankingindustry, where employment has been forecast by some observers to decline markedly over thenext 10 years \"as banks go electronic.\"9 Electronic cash and point-of-sales transactions, checkimaging, computerized expert systems capable of scoring credit applications, and stock transac-tions over the Internet are reducing the demand for workers in banks and brokerage houses.Banks resisting the electronic information revolution are likely to go out of business as theircompetitors provide more services at a lower cost.Urban vs. Rural Job Growth in Kentucky FIGURE 13.3Metropolitan Counties In KentuckyNational polls and surveys reveal thatAmericans generally prefer to live in smallercommunities and that they believe the qualityof life is higher in rural communities.' A lackof employment opportunities in rural areasespecially for highly skilled workers seekingcompensationcommensuratewiththeirtraininghas historically led many residentsof rural areas, including Kentuckians, to mi-grate or commute to urban areas. For exam-ple, 200 years ago 95 percent of the U.S.population lived in rural areas. Today, that share has dropped to under 25 percent. Recently, ru-ral areas have experienced a small renaissance resulting from rural manufacturing expansion andincreases in jobs that are not bound to a particular locality (such as Internet services providers).Improvements in communications technology and transportation infrastructure, and lower landcosts in rural areas, may lead to an acceleration of these trends in the future.Total job growth overthelast 25 years wasmore rapid in urban thanin rural areas of Ken-tucky,resultinginarelative shift from ruralto urban areas inthelocation of employment(Figure 13.4). For every100 jobs that existed in1969, urban areas added60 net new jobs, com-pared with 50 jobs addedin rural areas.The effects of reces-sions in the early 1970s,1980s, and again in 1991, on job growth in the state are visible in Figure 13.4. Both urban andrural areas shared in the prolonged national economic expansion starting in the mid-1980s, butThousands1200 1000 800 60019691974FIGURE 13.4Full- and Part-time Job Growthin Kentucky, by Area, 1969-1994 Thousands230Difference(Right axis) Rural 19791984Source: Basic data from U.S. Department of Commerce REIS1989180 130 801994 8 See also Rifkin, J.

Business Week, 38.I\u00b0 For example, see the results of a Roper poll of 1,210 adults reported in the Lexington Herald-Leader on June 11, 1992, A3.The urban-rural classification used here is based on U.S. Department of Agriculture definitions related to population size andadjacency to urban centers, and these terms are used interchangeably with \"metro\" and \"nonmetro.\" An urbanized area containsa population of at least 50,000. Before 1990, Kentucky had 19 urban (metro) and 101 rural ( nonmetro) counties according tothis definition.142 124Exploring the Frontier of the Future since 1982 the rate of new job creation has been more rapid in urban than in rural counties. In1969, rural counties had 51 percent of the state's population and 46 percent of all jobs; in 1994,they contained 52 percent of the population but only 45 percent of the jobs, as the number ofcommuters living in rural \"bedroom\" communities increased.In rural areas of Kentucky,fewer net new proprietorshipswere created than in urban ar-eas (Figure 13.5). For reasonsthat are not fully understood,proprietorships in both urbanand rural areas of the state grewat rates considerably below thenational average.While urban areas of thestate have been creating moretotal jobs than rural areas, thepattern for manufacturing jobsis quite different (Figure 13.6).Since 1969, manufacturing jobshave expanded more rapidly inrural than in urban areas; fur-thermore, all of the net newmanufacturing jobs were created in rural areas. While nearly 2 out of every 3 manufacturing jobsin Kentucky were located in urban areas in 1969, present trends are such that these jobs are al-most evenly divided between urban and rural areas. Urban areas contained about the same num-ber of manufacturing jobs in 1994 as in 1969 (about 160,000), while rural areas experienced a 65percent increase over this period (from 92,000 to 152,000). The rapid increase in rural manufac-turing employment since 1986, when plans for the Toyota Motor Manufacturing plant in ScottCounty were first announced, is noteworthy.KY--Urban KY--Rural 020406080Percent Growth Source: Basic data from U.S. Department of Commerce REIS100120 FIGURE 13.6Urban vs. Rural Job Growth in Manufacturing,ThousandsKentucky 1969-1994 Thousands 190 70 170 150 130 110 901969197419791984Source: Basic data from U.S. Department of Commerce REIS19891994Manyobserversmaintain that shiftsinmanufacturingemploymentna-tionwide from urbanto rural areas are theresultoffirmsseekinglow-skilland low-wage to carry out rou-tinemanufacturingworkinbranchplants. These kindsofjobsmaybeamongthemostlikely to be relocatedor lost to less devel-opedcountries,\"wherewagesarelower than in the United States and yet average skill levels are generally rising. Thus, it may be-come increasingly difficult over time for rural areas in Kentucky to compete on the basis of low \" Blair, J.P. (1995).Local economic development: Analysis and practice. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.143 Industry Trends: Jobs and Earnings 125 wages and skills in certain industries, as the recently announced closing of the Oshkosh B'Goshclothing plant in Adair County illustrates. A key challenge is to provide workers with the skillsand technology they need to compete with low-wage workers in other countries on the basis ofhigher productivity (or a lower labor cost index). It is noteworthy in this regard that exports ofgoods manufactured in Kentucky increased by more than 35 percent between 1990 and 1995 inconstant dollars, suggesting firms in the state were sufficiently competitive to expand theirsales.'2At the same time, innovations such as just-in-time inventory management by manufacturers,which requires the nearby location of parts suppliers, and the need for firms to operate close totheir markets to better monitor changes in consumer tastes and preferences, may attenuate thetendency of firms to locate overseas. Transportation costs and trade barriers in the form of quotasand domestic content legislation (for cars) may further reduce such tendencies.Service sector jobs grew more rapidly between 1969 and 1994 in urban areas, where they in-creased 140 percent from a base of 131,000 jobs, than in rural areas where the increase was by118 percent from 83,500 jobs in 1969. This may reflect higher earnings and purchasing power inurban areas, as well as agglomeration economies (which are inter- or intra-industry-specific costsavings that arise when two or more firms locate in the same place). The differential rate ofgrowth of service sector jobs in urban and rural areas explains most of the diverging job growthpattern observed in Figure 13.4. Forty-seven percent of all net new jobs generated in urban areasbetween 1969 and 1994 were in services, compared with only 33 percent in rural areas.Urban vs. Rural Earnings in KentuckySlow, and even negative,realwageandearningsgrowth are a concern to citi-zens and policymakers na-tionwide,becausetheyforebode declining standardsofliving.Perhapsmoreominously, a recent studyshows that U.S. employmentgrowth over the period 1979to 1987 was greater in in-dustries with lower averageearnings in 1992 and thenumber of jobs in industrieswith higher average earn-ings declined.\"Real earnings per job byplace of work are higher inurban areas of Kentucky, butthe earnings gap has fallen slightly in real terms, from $5,300 in 1969 to $5,100 per job in 1994(Figure 13.7).14 Following national patterns, real earnings per job in both rural and urban areas of$28,000 $26,000 $24,000 $22,000 $20,000FIGURE 13.7Real Earnings and RuralKentucky, 1969-1994(in 1994 dollars) Source: Basic data from U.S. Department of Commerce REIS 12 Kentucky Department of Employment Services.13 Isserman, A.M. (1994). State economic development policy and practice in the United States: A survey article. InternationalRegional Science Review, 16, 49-100.14 The argument is often made that lower incomes in rural areas are compensated for by lower costs of living, relative to urbanareas. While this is accurate for some items, such as housing or land values, it is not necessarily true for basic food staples andgasoline, as revealed recently in a Kentucky Farm Bureau survey (see Basics cost more in E. Kentucky. (1992, May 3).Lexington Herald-Leader. p. A 1). High costs of transportation into remote rural areas (particularly eastern Kentucky) and lackof competition among retailers can lead to higher costs for these items (or lower quality). These costs are compounded (in termsof cost and time) when rural residents commute over large distances to their places of work.144 126Exploring the Frontier of the Future the state are lower in 1994 than in the late 1970s. Nationwide, average hourly earnings in con-stant (1982) dollars fell from $7.78 per hour in 1980 to $7.40 in 1994. Average weekly earningsfell from $275 to $256 over the same period.Real manufacturing earnings per job are 42 percent higher in urban than in rural counties(Figure 13.8), compared with a 48 percent discrepancy in 1969. This supports the contention thatmanufacturers in part locatein rural areas (and low-wagestates) to take advantage oflower-costlabor.Further-more,realmanufacturingearnings per job in ruralareas are lower now, al-though only modestly, thanin1986, when the rapidexpansion in rural manufac-turing jobs began in Ken-tucky. Real manufacturingearnings per job have tendedto stagnate in urban areassince 1978.Realearningsintheservices sector have beengrowing slightly since 1980in urban areas and, withsome fluctuations, in rural areas. Thus, earnings are increasing modestly in the sector accountingfor most of the state's employment growth. In 1969, service sector earnings per job in rural areasin constant dollars were $2,200 below those in urban areas (a 12 percent difference). By 1994,the rural-urban earnings gap had increased to $4,100 (or 22 percent). Furthermore, service sectorearnings in Kentucky remain considerably below those in manufacturing, which is counter tonationwide trends:$45,000 - $40,000 - $20,000FIGURE 13.8Real andIndustry, Kentucky, 1969-1994(in 1994dollars)Urban urai $15,000.196919741979198419891994Source: Basic data from U.S. Department of Commerce REIS Misconceptions about the relative quality of jobs available to workers in various in-dustries abound. One of the most difficult to dispel is the idea that jobs in the goods-producing sector are uniformly superior. Over the last 15 years, goods-producing wageshave fallen as service-sector pay has increased, with the result that service workers nowgenerally earn about the same as their counterparts in manufacturing. Consequently,policy that favors goods-producing employment is not necessarily a sensible strategy forgenerating high-wage opportunities for American workers:5Real government earnings per job have increased in parallel fashion between 1969 and 1994 inurban and rural areas, averaging just over $27,500 per job in urban areas, and $24,200 in ruralareas in 1994. Consequently, although average earnings per job in services and the public sectorare lower (by up to two thirds) than earnings in manufacturing, the gap between the three sectorsis narrowing slowly as manufacturing earnings stagnate.Trends in Location QuotientsA location quotient shows the extent to which an area such as a state or county is specializedin a given industry. Here we calculate the quotient as the ratio of statewide earnings in a givenindustry to the total workforce in Kentucky, divided by the ratio of total earnings nationwide in 15 Dupuy, M., Schweitzer, M.E. (1994, February 1). Are service-sector jobs inferior? Economic Commentary.Cleveland, OH:Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.115 Industry Trends: Jobs and Earnings 127 the same industry to the national workforce. The location quotient for apparel and related prod-ucts manufacturing earnings per worker in 1994 roughly equals 2.0, indicating that the state hasa relatively higher share of its employment in apparel manufacturing than do other states. Thisnumber also suggests that the state is a net exporter of apparel and related products.In contrast, Kentucky's location quotient for furniture and fixtures manufacturing is onlyabout 0.5, suggesting the state has a low degree of manufacturing concentration in this industry,and that it is importing furniture and fixtures from other states or countries. A location quotientbetween 0.8 and 1.2 suggests that a state neither imports nor exports goods produced in that in-dustry.This kind of analysis provides clues about the relative strengths and weaknesses of Kentucky'seconomy and points to industriessuch as furniture and fixtureswhich are potential candidatesfor \"import-substitution.\" In these industries an opportunity may exist for profitable expansionwithin the state. In the following section we discuss manufacturing sub-industries which experi-enced significant trends in their location quotients during the years 1969 to 1994.Amongnondurablemanufactured goods, loca-tion quotients rose in fiveindustries over the 13.9): coal products,apparel other textileproducts, rubber and mis-cellaneous plasticsprod-ucts, textile mill products,and paper and allied prod-ucts. All but apparel hadlocation quotients near orbelow 0.5 in 1969. Today,textile mill and paper andallied products have a lo-cation quotient just below1.0, and the others have location quotients well above 1.0. This suggests that in all five industriesimport substitution has occurred, and/or exports from the state have increased. Companies suchas Fruit of the LoomTm and Scott Paper account for a large share of the trends in apparel andpaper products exhibited in the graph. In addition, the location quotient for tobacco manufactur-ers (not shown) declined from over 11.0 in 1969 to 7.2 in 1994.In the durable manufactured goods category, primary metals; motor vehicles and equipment;stone, clay and glass products; and lumber and wood products had location quotients below 1.0 in1969; today, all have quotients above 1.0. The motor vehicles and equipment sub-industry standsout, with a significant increase in the location quotient since 1986 (Figure 13.10). The remark-able success of the Ford Explorer sport utility vehicle, the Toyota Camry, and to some extent theCorvette explain the increase in the location quotient. At the same time, the quotient for primarymetal industries has remained flat after rising rapidly to above 1.5 between 1969 and '1987. Afterremaining below 1.0 for all of the 1970s and 1980s, the location quotient for the lumber andwoods products industry has now surpassed 1.0. The stone, glass and clay products industry basi-cally changed its status from import-dependent to an exporting industry. In contrast, the trend forfurniture and fixtures shows why some groups in the state have argued for increasing the value-added to wood products within the state rather than shipping raw lumber to states such as NorthCarolina to produce finished wood products: here the location quotient has fallen from 0.8 tounder 0.6.2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.0FIGURE 13.9Location 1969-1994Petroleum& & Misc.

The BLS projects total employment to grow by 14 percent over the years 1994 to2005, compared with 24 percent growth between 1983 and 1994. Wage and salary employmentin the goods-producing sector is forecast to decline by 900,000 jobs nationally, while self-employment in that sector is forecast to grow by 200,000 jobs. In contrast, Thompson's analysisindicates that, in the next few years, \". ..at least some job growth is expected in nearly everymanufacturing industry in Kentucky. ..\"\" Considerable continued growth is projected to occurnationally in the service sector, led by services including state and local government, educationand hospitals (by 33 percent); and followed by retail trade (13 percent); finance, insurance andreal estate (6 percent); transportation, communications and public utilities (7 percent); wholesaletrade (7 percent); and state and local government, excluding education and hospitals (7 per-cent).\"For 1996, Challenger, Gray and Christmas, Inc., recently predicted a total of 420,000 layoffsfrom corporations, a number similar to that in 1995.

This raises thequestion of whether the educational sector (especially postsecondary institutions but also highschools) should develop entrepreneurial training programs to assist those seeking to start theirown businesses. Lack of capital availability in the state to fund new ventures may constrain po-tential entrepreneurs.2. Trends in the manufacturing and service sectors in the state differ from national trends intwo important ways: manufacturing employment is growing rather than falling, and service sec-tor earnings have not yet caught up with manufacturing earnings. The promotion of automobilemanufacturing in the state appears to have been a sound strategy, and the robustness of this sec-tor largely insulated the state's economy in the most recent national recession.\" However, thestagnation of manufacturing earnings remains a concern to the extent that it forebodes stagnantstandards of living, and it remains to be seen whether public and private training efforts in thestate will ultimately lead to higher real manufacturing wages.3. Like other states, Kentucky has yet to feel the full impact of technological change in serv-ices on employment levels. On the one hand, increases in labor productivity should raise earningsin services and accelerate the rate of convergence between service and manufacturing sectorearnings. On the other hand, increases in productivity also will potentially reduce the number ofworkers needed by firms to produce current levels of output. Identifying training and employmentoptions for low-skilled workers displaced by technological advance in the services sector maybecome a key challenge facing policymakers in the next century.ReferencesBureau of the Census, US Department of Commerce.

This is driving a wedge betweenthe earnings of education \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" Corporate restructuring is eliminating hundreds ofthousands of jobs, many of which belong to professionals and managers, but at the same time it is creatingmany different kinds of jobs. Kentucky may have a more serious problem with worker layoffs than otherstates because a larger share of our workforce is employed in occupations which are not growing quicklyand because these workers do not have as much success finding new employment after a layoff New em-ployment might be found in technical jobs, particularly in health care, which will be among the fastestgrowing occupations in the coming years. Rural areas in Kentucky are already seeing rapid growth inthese occupations. By Peter SchirmerKentucky Long-Term Policy Research CenterStephan J. GoetzUniversity of Kentucky/n the previous chapter, we looked at changes in the industrial structure of the United Statesand Kentucky. In this chapter, we look at occupations in the rapidly changing, globally com-petitive, technologically advanced, service-based economy. New corporate practices andstrategies, technological advances and rising job skill requirements are making postsecondarytraining a virtual necessity for a high-paying job. This is driving a wedge between the earnings ofeducation \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" Corporate restructuring is eliminating hundreds of thousandsof jobs, many of which belong to professionals and managers, but at the same time it is creatinghundreds of thousands of different jobs. Kentucky may have a more serious problem with workerlayoffs than other states because a larger share of our workforce is employed in occupations thatare not growing quickly and because these workers do not have much success finding new em-ployment after a layoff. Displaced workers may find new opportunities for retraining as tech-nologists and technicians, particularly in the burgeoning health care-related field. This is trueeven in the most rural areas of the state, which have seen a dramatic increase in technical occu-pations in recent years.Skills and EducationHistorically, the manufacturing labor force of industrialized nations such as the United Statesconsisted of a small share of highly skilled, decisionmaking managers and a large proportion ofassembly line workers who needed only minimal training. Under Taylorism, the system of massmanufacturing pioneered by the engineer Frederick W. Taylor, assembly line activities were bro-ken down into their smallest components so that workers faced simple, compartmentalized andhighly repetitive tasks. Individual workers did not have to understand how their particular workfit into the creation of the end product, or the objectives of the firm. Formal educational andspecific skills requirements under this system were minimal, and the ready availability of mass-produced, inexpensive goods assured high and rising standards of living for workers.Current workforce training needs are largely the result of fundamental changes in the opera-tion of the U.S. economy. In particular, a shift is underway \". ..from an economy based mainly 149 132Exploring the Frontier of the Future on natural resources and economies of scale made possible by mass production for a large, rela-tively insulated American market to a more competitive global-information economy where eco-nomic success depends mainly on the quality of human resources.\"' As standards of living rise inthe United States, consumers increasingly also demand custom-tailored, high-quality and inno-vative goods and services delivered on a timely basis. According to one technology analyst, \"Youhave to plan for the birth of a new product and for its burial at the same time . ..if you're notplanning for both of those events, you're going to lose a lot of money and market share.\"' Theseforces have led to so-called \"diversified quality production\"' in high - performance (HP) work-places, a concept which is increasingly being adopted by the services sector.With escalating international competition, American firms faced the choice of (1) upgradingto new production technologies and using highly skilled and productive workers (also known asthe \"high road\"), or (2) keeping old technologies but combining them with less production andlower wage workers in developing countries (the \"low road\"). According to one estimate, fewerthan 5 percent of all American firms had adopted HP forms of work organization in 1992.,'' othersources estimate that perhaps as many as one-third of all manufacturing firms employing over 50workers now have adopted at least some HP principles.5' Freshwater and colleagues argue that\"at present, low-wage, low-skill employment may still provide an opportunity for developing amore highly skilled work force in the future, but the window for this strategy is closing.\"'While a formal, generally accepted definition of HP practices does not yet exist, commonfeatures of HP companies (such as Lexmark, Southwest Airlines, Texas Instruments, Toyota, etc.)include \"flexibility, innovation, quality, productivity, customer satisfaction, increased marketshares and higher profits.\"$ Osterman describes firms' expectations of modern workers as fol-lows: \"Today, employees are asked to understand and analyze certain kinds of data, to thinkabout ways to improve the processes and products of the workplace, and to work with others tobring improvements about. No longer is it enough to perform rote tasks on an assembly line.\"9In a similar vein, Zuboff writes that firms face the choice of automating or informating theirworkplaces.'\u00b0 The first choice leads to \"deskilling,\" whereby workers do (and earn) less overtime. In the \"informated\" workplace, in contrast, front-line workers are empowered to take onincreasing responsibilities and decisionmaking. Terms used to describe modern workers include\"skilled,\" \"specialized,\" \"flexible,\" and \"possessing interpersonal skills.\" The latter are requiredfor teamwork, which is becoming increasingly important in organizing labor. Feller notes thatworkers who are unable to execute certain key activities will be forced to \"compete with automa-tion, computerization and voice recognition equipment,\" with possibly detrimental consequencesfor their wages.\"Modern management methods are based on the realization that \"empowered\" workers, whocarry greater responsibilities, are more content and productive. Also, since front-line workersknow more about their particular work processes, they can help the firm gain strategic production Glover, R.W. and Marshall, R. (1993, Spring).

In general, a key criterion for success inthis new environment is the ability to match specific workers with specific technologies.'Workplace changes brought about by informating reduce the need for middle managementlayers, allowing firms to cut overhead costs as exemplified recently by widespread and highlypublicized layoffs of white collar workers in some of America's largest corporations. Informatingis occurring in many sectors, including financial services, where bank tellers are becoming morebroadly trained, not only to cash checks and receive deposits, but also to provide investment ad-vice. Small, self-contained cells of work teams allow computer manufacturer Compaq to respondquickly to changing customer demands, while at the same time raising worker output by 23 per-cent and improving quality by 25 percent.\" In automobile manufacturing, independent workerteams make decisions to resolve problems and schedule parts deliveries. In agriculture, farmersuse sophisticated information technology to vary fertilizer application rates as they pass throughtheir fields, compensating for variations in inherent soil fertility within fields.Other innovations, such as the ISO 9000 quality standard, reinforce changes in the work-place. Developed by the International Standards Organization, the ISO 9000 standard involvesthe implementation of systems designed to assure high quality in production. The standard alsorequires companies wishing to supply parts to other companies to identify worker training needsin areas where quality improvement is possible.\" Earning the ISO 9000 standard may become aprerequisite for U.S. firms that wish to export goods and services. The European Community hasalready adopted this standard.These workplace innovations are raising the demand for skilled and well-educated workers.While many of the highest paying jobs have always been filled by well-educated workers, manyhigh-paying jobs for people with less education were also available in the past. But in the comingyears, nearly all job openings (due to net job creation and replacement of current workers) in oc-cupations paying high wages will require at least some training after high school, and more thanhalf of all job openings in occupations paying high wages will require at least a college degree.As Table14.1shows, of the15millionjobopen-ings which will beavailableover thenext10yearstoworkers with only ahigh school educa-tion or less, 91 per-cent will pay low orverylowwages.Workers who par-ticipateinvoca-TABLE 14.1Projected Total Job Openings*by Education postsecondary 14.24736%16%48%Bachelor's degree or more 7,60380%19%1%Total lob openings represent the sum of employment increases and net replacements.Source: Authors' computations of Bureau of Labor Statistics employment projections and training needsfor each occupationtional training, formal training programs at work, or other postsecondary education will find thatalmost half of their employment opportunities are for jobs which pay low or very low wages.However, this category of workers includes people with very different training backgrounds. Asthese workers with some postsecondary training accumulate experience, they may move intohigher-paying occupations, even without obtaining a bachelor's degree. Finally, four out of fivejob openings requiring at least a bachelor's degree pay high or very high wages.However, Table 14.1 does not indicate that four out of five college graduates will have a high-paying job. In 1990, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projected that total demand (includingjob growth, job upgrading, and replacements) for college graduates will grow by 914,000 jobs a 12 Wirth, A.G.

The resultis that as many as 30 percent of college graduates in the job market could be in jobs not tradi-tionally requiring a four-year degree, or else they could be unemployed. During the previous dec-ade, about 20 percent of college graduates found themselves \"underutilized\" or unemployed.\"Too few graduates in some fields and too many in others may partly explain why so manycollege graduates find themselves in jobs not requiring a four-year degree, but Daniel E. Hecker,an economist with BLS, finds that few fields are actually facing shortages.' Yet Hecker also re-ports that the wage premium paid to workers with a four-year degree is higher no matter what theoccupation. The median weekly earnings for handlers, equipment cleaners, helpers, and laborers,for example, were $58 higher in 1990 for workers with four years of college than for workerswith only four years of high school. If you are a mechanic with four or more years of college,your earnings grew 42 percent between 1983 and 1990; with just four years of high school, yourearnings only grew 21 percent.\" TABLE 14.2Median Weekly Earnings of Full-time Wage and Salary Workersby Occupation and Years of School, support, including clerical $326$361$401Service, except private household $260$326$401Precision production, craft, and repair $465$543$601Transportation and material moving $411$455$500Handlers, cleaners, helpers and laborers $302$329$360Source: Current Population Survey, cited by HeckerCollege is not the only route to getting a job with high wages. Over the next decade, aboutone third of the expected 14 million job openings for occupations requiring less than a collegedegree but more than high school will pay high or very high wages. The Bureau of Labor Statis-tics reports that in 1993, nearly 40 percent of workers with less than a bachelor's degree earnedmore than $500 per week, and nearly 20 percent earned $700 per week or more.\" Yet despite thelack of bachelor's degrees, many of these workers have considerable training and experience;some training and certification programs take up to two years to complete. Not everyone mustor even shouldattend college, but some sort of postsecondary training will almost certainly benecessary if a person is to have a realistic chance at getting a \"good job.\"Wage InequalityThe trend toward wage inequality is well documented. Between 1969 and 1993, wages formen in the bottom 40 percent of the earnings distribution fell, and for men in the top 40 percentof the earnings distribution wages rose.' The trend was more pronounced in the 1980s and1990s. Women at all levels of the earnings distribution saw their wages rise between 1969 and 15Shelley, K. J. (1992, Summer).

Gary Bur-tless of the Brookings Insti-tutionwrites,\"In1969,income at the 95th percen-tileofadjustedpersonalless, than 12 times income at the 5th percentile. By 1993, income at the 95percentile was more than 25 times income at the 5th percentile.\" 'The news is not entirely bad, however because people are not locked into an income percen-tile for their entire lives. A 1992 study by the U.S. Department of Treasury, based on 14,351 in-come tax returns filed from 1979 through 1988, suggests that there is considerable mobilitybetween income levels. Of the people in the lowest income quintile in 1979, 21 percent rose tothe second quintile, 25 percent to the middle, 25 percent to the second-highest, and 15 percentmoved up to the top quintile. In other words, 86 percent of those in the bottom income quintile in1979 had managed to raise their incomes by enough to move to a higher quintile by 1988.22 Still,the gap between the highest and lowest quintiles is much larger today, meaning that people in thelower quintiles have more ground to make up than in 1979.Bottom2ndMiddleSource: Data from Bureau of the Census, calculated by Burtlessincome was a little4thTop Technology Growth, Trade, and ImmigrationAlthough numerous explanations have been offered as to why wage inequality has increased,at the center of the debate are two competing theories: one based on technology, the other on in-ternational trade and immigration. The former argues that as automation and computerizationhave grown in most industries, the demand for skilled workers has risen. Because skilled workersare relatively scarce, employers have been forced to bid for these workers by raising their relativeearnings. According to the latter, companies employing low-skill labor in the United States havehad to either depress wages or eliminate jobs in order to remain competitive, and immigrationhas enlarged the pool of available low-skill labor, which would also reduce the relative wages oflow-skill workers.Although trade and technology effects are not mutually exclusive, the preponderance ofopinion seems to be that technology is a bigger factor than international trade and immigration inskewing wages. Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution notes that between 1969 and 1993,U.S. industries most affected by trade have eliminated low-skill, low-wage workers no faster thanthe industries least affected by trade. This, he writes, is \"a pattern that is extremely hard to squarewith the claim that foreign trade is the main factor behind soaring wage inequality.\"\" In addi- Burtless.

Worsening American income inequality: Is world trade to blame? p.30._JL 136Exploring the Frontier of the Future tion, imports from developing countries represent a small share of gross domestic product, andthis share fell in the 1980s, even while the wage gap rose.\" Two economists at the Federal Re-serve Bank of New York concluded that technological progress was the most important influenceon wage inequality, while international trade made a more modest contribution to the problem.\"Finally, Stephen Golub, an economist at Swarthmore College, calculates that unit labor costs (thelabor cost of producing a single item) in many low-wage countries are quite close to, or in somecases higher than, unit labor costs in the United States because of much lower worker productiv-ity.26MIT economist Olivier Blanchard describes the high-skill labor market as a race between anincrease in relative supply and relative demand. As more people attend college or receive otherpostsecondary training, the supply of high-skill workers relative to low-skill workers rises and thewage premium paid to high-skill workers decreases because employers don't have to do as much\"bidding\" for labor. On the other hand, as technology spreads throughout the economy, the de-mand for high-skill workers relative to low-skill workers rises and employers must compete witheach other in order to retain high-skill labor. Blanchard writes, \"In the 1970s, relative supplywon; in the 1980s, relative demand won. But in both decades, the race has been fast on bothsides.\"\" Technology growth affects the relative demand for high-skill workers. Internationaltrade and immigration affect the relative supply. (As a truly global labor market emerges, thepool of low-skill labor increases, thus reducing the relative supply of high-skill labor.) In eithercase, the trends could lead to a larger wage gap between high- and low-skill workers. Blanchardalso warns that employment rates for low-skill workers could decrease significantly in the futureif current trends continue.Corporate RestructuringCorporate restructuring sounds innovative and bold, yet Americans have come to expect anaccompanying elimination of jobs. In 1995, U.S. corporations eliminated 440,000 jobs, bringingthe number of jobs cut in the 1990s by U.S. corporations to 2.9 million.\" The American Man-agement Association reports that the percentage of companies which downsize because of adownturn in business has fallen steadily in the 1990s. More than 40 percent of firms whichdownsized in 1990 and 1991 cited a business downturn as the sole cause of the downsizing, andanother 30 percent said a business downturn was a contributing cause. Today, about 30 of down-sizing firms say that a business downturn is a contributing cause, but only 4 percent of firms sayit is the sole cause. In contrast, the percentage of firms citing \"automation or other new technol-ogy\" as a reason for downsizing has more than doubled during the 1990s. Also, more than half ofdownsizing firms cited \"reengineering of business processes\" and almost two thirds cited\"organizational restructuring\" as reasons for downsizing.\"In other words, hundreds of thousands of workers are losing their jobs today, just as they didduring the beginning of the decade. However, they are doing so for different reasons. Many oftoday's workers are being replaced by other workers who do different jobs, or they are replacedby a computer or other technology. The moral to the story: Going back to work is more thansimply a matter of finding the same job with a different employer; today's displaced workers needretraining and may be re-employed in entirely different occupations. 24 SOIOW, R.

According to the U.S.Department of Labor, managerial andprofessional workers accounted for 24percent of all permanent layoffs from1991 to 1993, compared with 13 per-cent in 1981-1983. Even managers atthe top of the pay scale are vulner-able.\" Of course, blue-collar workers have lost many jobs as well. Rising productivity has enabledoutput to steadily grow while companies shed workers. Since 1989, manufacturing employmenthas fallen by half a million jobs.' Meanwhile, real manufacturing output is up by about 10 per-cent.\"After downsizing, the fates of white-collar workers and other workers are markedly different.BLS reports that more than 75 percent of white-collar employees who lost their jobs from 1993 to1995 had found work by February 1996. In contrast, only about 64 percent of low-skill blue-collar workers had found new jobs.\" Also, past studies have found that when laid-off blue-collarworkers find new jobs, the pay averages 20 percent less than the old job.\" Although more white-collar workers are losing jobs today than in the past, many find good jobs with other companies.Eric R. Greenberg, director of management studies for the American Management Association,observes that \"high-priced managers are being replaced with other high-priced managers withdifferent skills.\" (Arnst). By developing new skills, particularly in the areas of marketing, salesand technical occupations, many well-educated workers are finding excellent new job opportuni-ties.\"Corporate restructuring frequently involves outsourcing of some functions and elimination ofmany titles and positions. Outsourcing means hiring outside firms to do things formerly doneinside the company. Functions such as customer relations, data processing, debt collection, ad-vertising, and mailings are commonly outsourced these days, to the extent that employment inbusiness services industries (companies which provide services to other companies) doubled be-tween 1984 and 1994,\" and employment in the temporary-help industry has risen almost 50 per-cent since 1990, to 2.25 million in 1994.\" Often, employees whose jobs have been outsourced areoffered jobs doing the same thing for the same company, but in the employ of another firm.

While it is true that self-employmentis often less secure than a salary or wage position, individuals have many more resources thanthey did a generation ago. With the explosion of new information and communication technol-ogy, self-employed people have at their fingertips \"the creative power of a factory tycoon of theIndustrial Era, and the communications power of a broadcast tycoon of the. Television Era,\" inthe words of author George Gilder.\u00b0 Particularly with the emphasis on downsizing these days,more people may try to go into business as independent contractors and consultants.National and State ComparisonThe trends which are altering the nature of workrising job skill requirements, wage ine-quality, technological displacement of workers, global trade and immigration, and corporate re-structuringare just as significant in Kentucky as in the rest of the country. Nonetheless,Kentucky, like all states, has its unique characteristics. The age distribution of the populace, edu-cation levels, geography, climate, tax laws, and wage rates all affect the types of industries whichlocate in a particular area, the services demanded by residents, the kinds of jobs workers are ca-pable of doing, and the amount of technological investment in an area. As a result, the industriesand jobs in one state will be different from the industries and jobs in another or in the nation as awhole. For example, while less than 22 percent of the nation's workforce is employed in thegoods-producing sector of the economy, this sector employs 30 percent of the workforce in Ken-tucky.With technology enabling increased automation in the workplace and with the growing de-mand for outsourced business services, it is not surprising that blue-collar occupations are grow-ing much slower than service and white-collar occupations. By 1994, managerial andprofessional specialty occupations had nearly equaled blue-collar occupations as a share of na- 39 Bernstein. The wage squeeze.4\u00b0 As cited in Leyden, P. (1996).

In Ken-tucky, blue-collar occupations represent about 32 percent of the workforce, while managerial andprofessional specialty occupations account for only 20 percent. Thus workers with less educationmay have proportionately more opportunities for higher wage jobs in Kentucky than elsewhere.Conversely, highly educated workers have proportionately fewer high-wage job opportunities inKentucky.Employment shares in Kentucky and the nation appear to be changing at approximately thesame rate. Occupational employment projections for 2005 (see Table 14.5) suggest that manage-rial and professional specialty occupations will continue to increase their share of employmentnationally, while the share of jobs in traditional blue-collar occupations declines. Kentuckyshould mirror the national trends. However, blue-collar occupations will still comprise a signifi-cantly larger share of total employment in Kentucky than managerial and professional specialtyoccupations (29.6 percent versus 20.8 percent). Unless Kentucky's industrial composition(discussed in the previous chapter) changes dramatically, it is likely that Kentucky will have anabove-average share of its jobs in blue-collar occupations for many years to come. Nonetheless,Kentucky mirrors the United States in terms of occupational growth: managerial and professionalspecialty occupations are growing considerably faster than blue-collar occupations.BLS predicts rapid growth in service occupations in the next decade. Service occupationsinclude food preparation, child care, law enforcement and fire fighting, housekeepers and healthservice occupations such as nursing aides and occupational therapy aides. Service occupations donot, however, include most people who work in \"business services\" industries, such as account-ing, data processing, and law. Most people in those industries are classified as either techniciansor professional specialists. Thus, most of the jobs in the high-growth category of service occupa-tions are lower paying ones. Service occupations in health care are expected to be among thefastest growing 01 BLS predicts that the increase in health service occupations between 1994 and2005 will be three times the increase between 1983 and 1994.Growth of the health care industry should also boost employment for technicians and relatedtechnical support occupations. Health technicians will account for 70 percent of the growth in thetotal number of technicians between 1994 and 2005.42 The growing health care industry may af-fect Kentucky's workforce more than the nation's. Between 1987 and 1994, health techniciansand technologists (a sub-category of technicians and technologists) increased employment by 54percent in Kentucky, and the Department for Employment Services projects a 30 percent increasebetween 1994 and 2005.43 Growth has been especially high in some rural parts of the state. Yetwith less than 5 percent of total employment, technicians and related support occupations willremain rather small compared to other occupational groups. 41 Silvestri, G.T. (1995, November).

Rural areas in Kentucky have, as one might expect, more people employed in farming,forestry and fishing occupations, while urban areas have more engineers, lawyers and other pro-fessional occupations. Figure 14.2 compares the size of occupational groups in urban and ruralcounties in Kentucky.' Occupational groups which fall along the diagonal line hold the same share of total employment in urban and rural counties; groups above the line comprise a larger share of employment in rural counties and groups below the line comprise a larger share of em-ployment in urban counties. The group farthest above the line is operators, fabricators and labor-ers (Group H)-blue-collar occupations which generally require few skills and pay low wages. In 1990, 24 percent of the rural workforce was employed in this occupational group, compared to only 16 percent of the urban workforce. Rural areas also have a higher percentage of precisionproduction, craft and repair occupations (Group C), which are higher paying, higher skilled blue-collar occupations. On the other hand, the highest paying, highest skilled jobs-executive, ad- ministrative and managerial occupations (Group E) and professional specialty occupations (Group 0)-account for a significant share of employment in urban areas. These occupationscomprise a smaller share of employment in rural areas. 44 There are many ways of classifying counties on a rural-urban scale. If the U.S. Bureau of the Census includes a county in a metropolitan statistical area (MSA), we classify it as urban. Otherwise, we classify it as rural.1 5 q Occupational Trends 141 25 2200015 cc010 a_a)5 0FIGURE 14.3Occupational Groups in Rural andUrban Kentucky, 1990 CrI A 05101520Percent of Urban Workforce KeyA: Farming, forestry and fishing occupationsB: Technicians and related support occupationsC: Precision production, craft and repair occupationsD: Sales occupationsE: Executive, administrative, managerial occupationsF: Service occupationsG: Professional specialty occupationsH: Operators, fabricators, handlers, and laborersI: Administrative support occupations, including clericalSource: Data from U.S. Bureau of the Census25From 1980 to 1990, the growth ratesfor certain occupational groups werequite similar in urban and rural counties.Technicians and related support occupa-tions, sales occupations, and professionalspecialty occupations grew at about thesame rates in rural and urban counties.What makes the similarities in occupa-tional growth rates remarkable is the factthataggregatepopulationinurbancounties increased while in rural coun-ties it fell.Butbeneaththesimilaritiesingrowthratesforsome occupationalgroups, differencesbig differencesexist. In sales occupations, for example,jobs increased just as fast between 1980and 1990 in rural counties as in urbancounties, yet cashiers accounted for 43percent of the new sales occupations inrural counties and only 23 percent inurban counties. The rest of the new salesjobs went to supervisors and proprietorsof sales companies, sales representativesfor commodities and finance, and othersales occupations. Professional specialtyoccupations also increased at approxi-mately the same rate in urban and ruralcounties, yet engineers and natural sci-ence occupations (which is a sub-category of professional specialty occupations) grew 22 percentin urban counties and only 2 percent in rural counties. Urban counties also had a significantlyfaster increase in the number of doctors, dentists and other health diagnosing occupations(another sub-category of professional specialty occupations).Perhaps nowhere is the contrast between rural and urban counties more apparent than in thegrowth of service occupations and executive, administrative and managerial occupations. Be-tween 1980 and 1990, rural counties had 60 percent of the state's new service occupations butonly 30 percent of the state's new executive, administrative and managerial occupations.The Future of Work in KentuckyClearly, there are fundamental changes at work in the economy. High-skill workers are highlyvalued, and their earnings reflect that. Wages are growing more unequal. As technology andtrade compel corporations to restructure and enable manufacturing to produce more goods withfewer workers, business services and personal services are growing quickly. What does all of thismean for the future of work?The spread of technology has made professional and technical workers increasingly produc-tive and, as MIT economist Olivier Blanchard notes, has increased the relative demand for theseworkers faster than the relative supply. On the other hand, trade and technology are working toshrink manufacturing employment while personal services industries boom. Thus less-skilledworkers must increasingly seek employment in service occupations, which do not pay nearly aswell as many of the blue-collar production jobs they replace. The result: bipolar wage growth.Well-educated workers are earning more, and less educated workers are earning less.1 5 Q 142Exploring the Frontier of the Future This is obvious when we look at occupational employment growth. In Kentucky and the restof the nation, professional specialty occupations and service occupations are expected to be thetwo fastest growing occupational categories. In Kentucky, two out of every five new jobs will bein one of these two categories. Nationally, more than half of all new jobs will be in one of the twocategories. Yet professional specialty occupations and service occupations are at opposite ends ofthe education and skills spectrum. Almost all professional occupations require at least a four-yearcollege degree. Conversely, very few service occupations require postsecondary training, andmany jobs require little training whatsoever. Professional specialty occupations also pay muchbetter wages than service occupations.Marketing and sales occupations will provide about 15 percent of all new jobs in Kentuckyand the nation. Many of these occupations pay good wages, and they do not necessarily requireextensive schooling or training after high school. Thus, less educated workers may wish to seekemployment in sales and marketing. In other occupational categories, Kentucky's executive,administrative and managerial occupations are projected to account for 8.5 percent of all newjobs over the next decade, versus 12.3 percent of new jobs nationally. Blue-collar production oc-cupations are projected to account for 22.3 percent of all new jobs in Kentucky, compared to only9 percent nationally. Kentucky, like the nation, is projected to have a decline in agricultural oc- cupations.\"Technological advances and global trade will put special pressure on states like Kentuckywith fewer college graduates and less income. In the past, many kinds of business and personalservices had to be based close to the customers, but technology has eliminated many spatial re-quirements for businesses. Today, companies and individuals can provide instruction, legal serv-ices, and even medical care from remote sites. And high-growth companies such as softwaredevelopers can locate almost anywhere. States with a well-educated populace and a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure will likely be the states with the most competitive businessservices industries.Meanwhile, international trade affects some industries intensely, even though its impact onthe nation's economy overall may be small (some contend it's quite significant). One such indus-try affected by trade is apparel manufacturing, which also happens to be the largest manufactur-ing employer in rural Kentucky. As apparel manufacturing moves to Latin America andSoutheast Asia, job loss here could be significant. Thus Kentucky finds itself facing tough com-petition for high-skill business service jobs, which offer the best new high-wage opportunities,and tough competition for low-skill production jobs, which provide employment for many thou-sands of Kentuckians.Corporate restructurings can hurt all workers, but white-collar workers tend to fare better inthe aftermath. A number of white-collar employees who are downsized out of a job land on theirfeet by starting their own consulting or business service company. How do they do it? With acomputer and a modem. Others learn new skills and go to work for another company, often at ornear their previous salaries. Blue-collar workers typically don't do as well. Because we have anabove-average share of blue-collar workers and a below-average share of white-collar workers,more Kentuckians may have to settle for lower wages or part-time jobs after their companiesdownsize.The future is not necessarily grim, however. Nicholas Negroponte, the founder and director ofthe Media Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, believes that the digital age \"hasfour very powerful qualities that will result in its ultimate triumph: decentralizing, globalizing,harmonizing and empowering,\" despite the fact that he also foresees added invasions of privacy,data thievery, and, worst, widespread job loss and the disappearance of lifetime employment.'The very technology which increases competition for Kentucky businesses can also bring un-tapped opportunities, particularly for rural areas which now have access to potential customers 46 Kentucky Department for Employment Services. Kentucky occupational employment outlook and job openings, 1994 to 2005.46 Negroponte, N. (1995). Being digital.

More and more professionals may choose to live inrural areas and do their work at home. The new technology may also make it much easier forpeople to learn new skills and to continuously upgrade old ones. Jeremy Rifkin points out thatthose people who do not have private-sector jobs may redirect their energies toward non-profitorganizations and charities.To ensure that Kentucky will not just survive but thrive in the new economy, it is essentialthat workers and businesses across the community have modern hardware and software whichallow them to work and learn and conduct business over the Internet. Furthermore, college andother postsecondary education is absolutely essential.\" Some high-paying jobs require relativelyfew skills, but they are scarce. For workers with no special training beyond an ordinary highschool diploma, 9 out of 10 job openings during the coming decade will pay low or very lowwages. And workers may simply have to get accustomed to less job security. Skill requirementsare continuously rising, contingency employment is growing dramatically and fewer businessesoffer non-wage benefits.\" Those workers who will thrive in the future will be those with the per-sonal skills, temperament, and expectations of what it takes to succeed in a more fluid work envi-ronment. 47 See \"Workforce Training Issues\" in Section 2 of this volume for a discussion of workforce development trends and needs.48 See \"Renegotiating the Social Contract\" in Section 3 of this volume for a discussion of the changing employer-employeecontract 161 Kentucky's Coal Industry:Historical Trends and Future Opportunities Kentucky contains sufficient coal resources to support mining well into the future, but whether theseresources can be economically mined at competitive coal prices will depend on many factors. Some of thesefactors include: the size and quality of the reserve base; transportation costs; market demand and competi-tion; mining and processing technology advances; and government regulation. In order to ensure the long-term economic viability of Kentucky's coal industry, a careful assessment of these factors should be under-taken. By Gerald A. Weisenfluh, James C. Cobb, John C. Ferm and Carol L. RuthvenUniversity of KentuckyCoal has been produced in Kentucky's two coal fields (Figure 15.1) since the beginning ofthe 19th century and has been the state's most important mineral resource since that time.In 1994, the coal industry employed more than 24,000 miners, and tax revenues generatedfrom all economic activity related to the industry provided more than 11 percent of General Fundreceipts in Kentucky.' Today, more than 50 percent of the nation's electricity is generated incoal-fired power plants, and 95 percent of the electricity generated in Kentucky comes from coal.Clearly, demand for coal is strong and will remain so well into the future. Many factors affectKentucky coal production: the size and quality of the reserve base, market demand and competi-tion, transportation infrastructure, mining and processing technology, and government regula-tion. Understanding the complex relationships among these factors will help identify futureopportunities for continued development of coal resources and realization of the associated eco-nomic benefits for coal-producing counties and the state.Contrasts in eastern and western Kentucky coal resources present different challenges andopportunities for future development. Western Kentucky's coal is generally of greater thicknessthan that of eastern Kentucky, but has higher sulfur content. Surface access to western Kentuckycoal is more limited, and more costly underground mines will be the primary method of extrac-tion. Eastern Kentucky coals are typically thinner and more variable in thickness than those ofwestern Kentucky, but are of higher quality. Greater physiographic relief in the east has providedgreater accessibility for near-surface mining. Decisions regarding regulation of emissions frompower plants and taxation levels are likely to affect Kentucky's coal fields in different ways, butas of this writing the outcomes of these issues are not known.Increasing competition from the western United States in the steam coal market will presenta significant challenge for Kentucky coal mines. Innovations in mining, processing, marketing,and transportation can position companies for future success. One such opportunity will beidentification of specialty steel and chemical markets, which attract significantly higher prices forcoal with desirable quality characteristics. In order to better prepare for future needs, an under-standing of factors affecting past coal production is essential. 1 Oral communication, Kentucky Department of Employment Services.162 ILAg&baleWW*/ aI.4.40404441IrtWesternntuckyde11i----_,4- n Kentucky '1-4- - CoalIf4Coal Survey1 E 15.1Kentucky's Bituminous Coal Fields Kentucky's Coal Industry: Historical Trends and Future Opportunities 147Historic Trends in Coal ProductionCoal was first produced in eastern Kentucky in 1790 and by 1820 in western Kentucky.Early mining resulted in only small tonnages, mainly for local use. Low production levels wereprimarily a function of modest demand and lack of efficient transportation routes. Regional usageof coal was primarily for steam locomotives, manufacturing, and domestic fuel. One of the earli-est commercial markets was for cannel coal, a high-Btu product used for domestic heating. Can-nel mines were developed in western Kentucky and in the outlying counties of the EasternKentucky Coal Field, but there were no efficient transportation routes to outside markets from themain part of this field.The first large production increase occurred in the early 1920s as a result of penetration ofcommercial rail lines into the eastern coal fields and increased demand for coal for steam loco-motives. During the economic depression of the 1930s, demand for coal declined, and with di-minished coal production there was little impetus for technological improvement. Until thebeginning of World War H, almost all mining in Kentucky was by underground methodg, as thetechnology for efficient surface mining had not yet been applied (Figure 15.2). FIGURE 15.2Annual Production from 1900 to 1995 By Coal Field and Mine ToeWestern Kentucky Eastern Kentucky100 190019101920193019401950 1960197019801990 19801990 109-Annual Surface Production ,,,,, 1 1 1 Annual Underground Production 1900191019201990 SW 1950 1900 197019801990Some:KantuckyDapedmentolAireendlAhen*190019101920193019401950 1980 WM WW 1990The next significant production increase occurred during the industrial expansion associatedwith World War II. Large-area surface-mine machines (draglines) were used to develop the rela-tively flat terrain of the Western Kentucky Coal Field, and this would be the dominant method ofmining in this region until the mid-1980s. Surface mine production for western Kentucky hassteadily decreased from 1970 to the present (Figure 15.2a). This trend may be due to diminishedsurface-mineable reserves, as surface access to mineable coals in western Kentucky is limited tothe periphery of the coal field, much of which has been previously mined.In eastern Kentucky, growing demand for coal in the 1940s resulted in increased under-ground mining (Figure 15.2d), but the steep slopes of this mountainous area prevented develop-ment by the early surface-mining equipment. A shift toward surface-mine production did notoccur until the 1970s. This was a response to developments in contour surface mine technology,unusually high demand for coal as a result of the OPEC oil embargo, and increasing under-ground mine costs. However, the trend toward increasing surface-mine production quickly re-versed, as extensive production diminished high-quality surface reserves and the regulatory costs165 148Exploring the Frontier of the Future of surface mining increased in 1977 after passage of the Federal Surface Mine Control and Rec-lamation Act. Since that time, eastern Kentucky surface mine production has shown a slight de-cline, whereas underground mining has increased significantly (Figures 15.2b and 15.2d).Changes in coal utilization within the last half of this century have had a significant impacton the production and marketing of coal from Kentucky. First, traditional fuel markets and coalfor steam locomotives virtually disappeared, leaving electric power generation and coking coalfor the steel industry as the principal markets. Eastern Kentucky underground mine productionwas especially influenced by large-scale replacement of steam by diesel locomotives in the periodbetween 1950 and 1960 (Figure 15.2d). This was followed by a shift from northern fuel marketsto southern utility markets. In addition, the market for coking coal was greatly diminished bydownsizing in the steel industry in the 1970s. Existing and anticipated clean air legislation alsoaffected the marketing of both high- and low-sulfur coal. Initially, demand for high-sulfur coaldiminished, but as electric power-generating facilities with scrubbing technology became avail-able, this demand returned. More recently, Kentucky coal has been faced with strong competitionfrom inexpensive low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming and Montana. Thiscoal is now capturing some traditional utility markets for Kentucky coal located in the midwest-ern and eastern United States.As a result of major technological ad-vances in mining techniques, more coal isbeing mined in Kentucky than ever before,and thisisbeing accomplished with asmaller number of mines and fewer employ-ees. Over half of all coal produced in thestate has been extracted only within the last25 years (Figure 15.3), and the questionarises whether or not this level of productioncan be profitably sustained in the future. Theanswer will depend on a thorough under-standing of the current reserve base; mining,transportation, processing technologies; thenature of future markets; and the impact ofregulations. The socio-economic impact of these changes in Kentucky coal mining will also re-quire careful assessment because of the economic impact that mining jobs have for the state.2FIGURE 95.3Annual cumulative percent of Kentucky coal production100 75 25 01900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990Sauce: Kentucky Department of Mines end Minerals5.6 BT 3.7 BT 1.9 BT 4 Transportation and MarketingTwo modes of coal transportation dominate Kentucky's supply infrastructure and represent asubstantial portion of the cost of delivered coal. More than three fourths of mined coal is trans-ported by truck from the mine site to either preparation or loading facilities. This is true for bothcoal fields, but direct rail shipment is more practical in western Kentucky because there are fewermines and the infrastructure is better developed. Coal transportation to the end user (principallyutilities) is approximately two thirds by railroad and the balance by barge or truck. Rail access forspecific areas is typically limited to a single carrier, and where multiple carriers serve a region,rates are reported to be somewhat different. Deregulation of rail rates, implemented by the Fed-eral Staggers Rail Act of 1980, is generally believed to have been disadvantageous for easternU.S. coal producers, as the resulting reduction in rail shipping rates has increased competitionfrom the western United States. Over the long term, Kentucky's coal producers may have to seekalternative transportation methods or expand sales of coal for on-site generation of electricity for 2See Geroyan,R.I.,Teeters, D.D., His, M.N. (1994). Economic impact analysis of the coal mining industry in Pike County,Kentucky.U.S. Bureau of Mines, Coal Recoverability Series (Open-File Haywood, C.F. (1996).The effects of the Kentucky coal industry on the economy of the Commonwealth. Lexington,KY: University of Kentucky Center for Business and Economic Research.166 Kentucky's Coal Industry: Historical Trends and Future Opportunities 149 distribution to distant markets. The latter approach will require an established reserve base andtechnology for efficient and cost-effective transmission of electricity.The impact of transportation costs is exacerbated by the low average sales price for steamcoal. Low profit margins have forced companies to increase production and, at the same time,reduce employment of miners and support staff. Alternative marketing strategies to target higherprofit margins have been successful for a few companies, but they require detailed knowledge ofcoal quality characteristics and typically result in low-volume contracts in the steel and chemicalindustries. Alternative markets do, however, have sales prices 2 to 10 times the value of steamcoal. The advantage of this marketing strategy is that mining and transportation costs are re-duced because fewer tons are required to generate an acceptable profit margin. Unfortunately,little information is known about these markets and whether they have the potential to reduce thecurrent reliance on the steam coal market.Coal Resource EstimatesThe basis of current estimates of Kentucky coalmapping conducted between 1960 and 1983 by theGeological Survey. These maps and coal data rep-resent the nation's most complete and accurategeographic and stratigraphic information aboutcoal and have established Kentucky as a leader incoal-resource characterization. Estimates for 100coal beds suggest original in-place resources of 64billion tons (BT) for eastern Kentucky.' WesternKentucky has 33 coal beds that amount to 40 BT.4The larger eastern resource results from its greaterarea and number of coal beds. The resource esti-mates are categorized by bed thickness and, insome cases, overburden height, which are impor-tant factors in determining mining methods. Inaddition, resources are tabulated on the basis ofproximity to points of coal thickness measurement.The distribution and characteristics of coal re-sources among individual coal beds and geographicareas are not uniform, and this has had a definite impact on coal production trends for specificareas. Kentucky's two coal fields are distinctly different in terms of the thickness and quality ofcoal resources and their accessibility for mining. These factors will play an important role in fu-ture coal development.resources is the 1:24,000-scale geologicKentucky Geological Survey and the U.S. FIGURE 15.4Distribution by thickness for the top 10 coal bedsIn RandsHazard 10 beds of the Princess District, Kentucky: University of Kentucky Institute for Miningand Minerals Research, Energy Resource Series; Brant, R.A.

Lexington, KY: University of Kentucky Institute for Mining and Minerals Research. 1'7 150Exploring the Frontier of the Future Although Kentucky's potentially mineablebeds are numerous, only a relatively few havesignificant coalresources. Further,thesere-sources are not uniformly distributed throughoutthe coal fields. In eastern Kentucky, 25 percent ofthe original resource is associated with the UpperElkhorn Nos. 1, 2, and 3 beds and 67 percentwith the top 10 coal beds (Figure 15.4). In west-ern Kentucky, 90 percent of the resource occurswithin six coal beds (Figure 15.5). These 16 coalbeds have also beentheleading producersthroughout the state's history. Not all areas ofeach coal field are favored with abundant coal. Ofthe 35 coal counties in eastern Kentucky, thesoutheastern 10 counties contain 75 percent of the resource, and Pike and Harlan Counties have30 percent of the estimated coal. In western Kentucky, only 8 of the 17 coal counties have morethan 1 BT, and 70 percent of the resource is located in four counties.Eastern Kentucky has more resources in thin beds than does western Kentucky. In easternKentucky, more than 50 percent of the coal is estimated to be less than 28 inches thick. Only twobeds are believed to contain more than 1 BT of coal with a thickness greater than 42 inches, theLower Elkhorn and Fire Clay (Figure 15.4). The total amount of coal greater than 42 inches inthickness comprises only 17 percent of the entire estimate for eastern Kentucky (Figure 15.6),and much of this is associated with thetop 10 beds. In contrast, only 5 percentof western Kentucky's estimate is lessthan 28 inches thick, and 69 percent isgreater than 42 inches thick (Figure15.7). All six of the commonly minedcoals in western Kentucky contain morethan 1 BT of resources (Figure 15.5).These differences in coal bed thicknessin the coal fields are important becausethey have implications for the type oftechnology necessary to expand the eco-nomic resource base.All coal mined in Kentucky is of bituminous rank, but other quality parameters of coal bedsare different in the two coal fields. Western Kentucky coals tend to be of moderate to high sulfurcontent and moderate Btu value. Eastern Kentucky is believed to contain one of the largest re-sources of low-sulfur, high-Btu coal, although moderate- to high-sulfur coals are also mined. Ashcontents vary greatly, and recent experience in eastern Kentucky suggests that the remainingresource will have higher levels of ash than that previously mined.FIGURE 15.5Distribution by thickness for the top 6 coal bedsin western Kentucky.

Foremost among these was a lack of accounting for regulatory and tech-nological factors that limit resource development. The council concluded that the existing esti-mates overstate the amount of coal that can actually be mined. The factors that restrict mininginclude competing land uses (e.g., state and national parks, municipal areas, cemeteries, andstreams) and geologic and engineering constraints (e.g., coal of insufficient thickness, unstable 5Blaclunore, G., Ehrenreich, S.B. (1987). Reserve data base report of the National Coal Council: Advisory report to theU.S. Department of Energy. Arlington, VA: Author.16Q Kentucky's Coal Industry:Historical Trends and Future Opportunities 151 roof conditions, proximity to adjoining underground mines). In order to address these problemsin the previous resource assessment methodology, a national coal availability program was estab-lished, and the Kentucky Geological Survey developed the original pilot project.'Land-use(regulatory)restrictionsmay be locally important, but their im-pact on a regional scale is small in Ken-tucky. One reason is that the coal fieldsare in rural areas, and mineable coalstend to be remote from most competingland uses. Many of the restrictions thato do apply have been dealt with to mini-mizelossof reserves.Technologicallimitations have a significant impact onmineability, and the principal factor isthe inability to extract thin coal seamswith available underground equipment.This is particularly true in eastern Ken-large proportion of the resource is less than 28 inches thick. Western Kentuckyhas areas that may be too deep to mine or are too structurally complex, and there are some mineblocks with insufficient acreage for economic development. Both regions have some resourcesthat have been sterilized due to mining of adjacent beds, but this is not a widespread problem.Together these technological limitations may affect more than 50 percent of the original resource.FIGURE 15.7Proportional Coal Tonnage Directions for Future Coal Resource StudiesFuture regional coal resource studies should consider the unequal distribution of coal re-sources and the effects of technological limitations on mining. Most of the state's coal resourcesare contained in a small number of beds, and these should be emphasized in new studies. There isevidence that reserves in several of the principal beds may be significantly diminished, and if thisis true, new resources of comparable quality must be identified and characterized. The availabil-ity of coal for mining is greatly affected by the geological variability of the coal beds. The datanecessary to document this variability are, for the most part, not publicly available for regionalresource studies, and as a result the impact of technological limitations may be underestimated.An effort must be made to acquire sufficient data to define the limits of mining for specific coalbodies. Finally, public data concerning the quality of mineable coals, particularly trace elementchemistry, are insufficient to prepare detailed estimates of coal quality for beds to be mined in thefuture. The latter information will be crucial for the successful development of Kentucky's re-maining resources.Impacts of Regulation and TaxationRegulations at the local, state and federal levels have an impact on the mining, transporta-tion, and use of Kentucky coal. A number of regulatory and taxation issues are particularly im-portant, and their future impact is uncertain: the effects of Clean Air Act Amendments ondemand for Kentucky coal; liability for unreclaimed surface mines; regulatory flexibility topermit changes in post-mine land use; and the outcome of changes in the state's workers' com-pensation law. 6 Eggleston, J.R., Carter, M.D., Cobb, J.C. (1990). Coal resources available for developmentA methodology and pilotstudy.(U.S. Geological Survey Circular 1055). Washington, DC: U.S. Geological Survey.-169 152Exploring the Frontier of the Future The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Title HI of the Federal Clean Air Act Amend-ments of 1990 concerns hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). There are a total of 200 substancesclassified as hazardous air pollutants, and 11 of these occur in trace amounts in coal. Industrialcompanies generating these substances who are deemed to be \"significant emitters\" are requiredto use available technology to the fullest possible extent to reduce emission of HAPs. At the pres-ent time, coal-burning power plants are not considered to be significant emitters. However, astudy has been under way by the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a number ofyears to collect information to address this issue. A two-year extension is being sought to allowmore data collection, particularly with respect to arsenic and mercury. At the time of the writingof this paper, no official position had been taken by the EPA with regard to additional regulationof coal burning.Some utilities are reportedly consuming coal with sulfur contents substantially below theregulated levels in order to exceed the requirements of the Clean Air Act and accumulate creditsfor sulfur dioxide emissions in the future. This trend, if it continues, may affect the long-termavailability of low-sulfur, high-value coal in eastern Kentucky.Regulatory Issues Relating to Surface Mines. Most areas that were surface mined prior tothe Federal Surface Mine Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 contain unreclaimed surfacemines. Some companies are considering remining such areas because of increased capabilities foroverburden removal. However, reclamation liabilities, and their associated costs, of the pre-existing mines will be a factor. It has been suggested that this has been a deterrent to develop-ment of a significant amount of reserves adjacent to these unreclaimed surface mines. The magni-tude of this problem, however, has not been quantified on a statewide basis.Post-mine land-use changes can greatly enhance the long-term economic development of thecoal fields. This is particularly true in eastern Kentucky where flat land suitable for developmentis scarce. Examples of land-use changes include sport and wildlife sites, development areas forindustry, government and residential facilities, airports, and agricultural uses. In Kentucky, all ofthese applications have proven to be successful alternatives to restoration of mine sites to theoriginal slope of the land. Moreover, in many cases, they result in an environment that is morestable than pre-mine conditions. Design of the sites must be carefully planned to account for thephysical and hydrologic conditions of the area. When this is accomplished, post-mine land useshelp provide a means of sustaining local economies after mining has been completed.Workers' Compensation.The high costs of workers' compensation levees are cited bymany coal companies as a major impediment to the mining industry in Kentucky. The state'sassessment of this tax is reportedly significantly higher than that of surrounding states. Legisla-tive changes in the workers' compensation law will also clearly affect the coal industry.Extraction and Processing TechnologyUnderground Mining. Recent trends in coal production suggest that underground miningwill be an increasingly important recovery method for Kentucky coal. Currently, about 60 percentof underground mines in the state use continuous mining systems. Longwall systems, which aremore productive and efficient, account for less than 10 percent of production. Low usage oflongwalls in western Kentucky is probably due to the high capital investment for the equipment,as well as lower sales prices for the higher sulfur coal. In eastern Kentucky, low usage is mainly afunction of smaller mines and more variable and thinner coal beds. Another method, highwallmining, requires surface access, but is actually a remote underground mining systein. Highwallminers have had mixed success at Kentucky mines, but may be effective under proper geologicconditions. Each of these mining systems will have continued use in the future, but should beused with appropriate geologic and engineering planning.170 Kentucky's Coal Industry: Historical Trends and Future Opportunities 153 The technological challenges for underground, mining differ for the two coal fields. A sub-stantial portion of western Kentucky's reserves are in beds greater than 42 inches thick, but atdepths greater than 1,000 feet. Existing mining equipment is probably adequate to extract thisresource, but ground control and mine planning methods should be enhanced to allow for safemine development at greater depths. In contrast, thinner, more: ariable coal beds will be crucialin future coal mining in eastern Kentucky, where improvements in thin-seam and remote-miningtechnology will be important for converting resources into reserves.Surface Mining. There is substantial evidence in both coal fields that extensive mining ofsurface reserves has affected production, but it is uncertain whether technological advances insurface mining equipment will have a major impact in the future. Regulatory constraints associ-'ated with surface mining are thought to have reduced the feasibility of mining some reserves.Few would want environmental- standards relaxed, but flexibility in post-mine land use couldhave a beneficial effect on the coal fields.Coal Preparation Technology. Some of the most important advances affecting coal market-ing involve processing. Many modern preparation facilities are equipped with analyzersthat constantly monitor the quality of coal entering and leaving the plant. Sophisticated distribu-tion systems permit the separation, by size and quality, of coal products destined for a variety ofcustomers with specific needs. These methods are not without costs, and improvements in proc-essing technology should focus on achieving cost efficiency. In particular, inexpensive pre-processing for ash removal from high-ash beds will be important in eastern Kentucky.Coal-Bed Methane Extraction. Future potential may exist in Kentucky for extraction ofmethane gas from coal beds that could be used as an energy byproduct of the coal resource.Methane (CH4) is a naturally occurring gas associated with coal beds and has been economicallyrecovered from coal in some coal basins. Significant commercial production of coal-bed methaneoccurs in Alabama and New Mexico. In areas adjoining the Eastern Kentucky Coal Field (i.e.Virginia), methane has long been extracted from coal beds prior to mining for safety reasons andthere are current activities for commercial development. The possibility of coal-bed methane pro-duction in Kentucky is supported by the existence of some mines with histories of methane prob-lems and successes of recent test holes.Directions For Future Technology. New technologies are vital for the future extraction ofKentucky's coal resource. A detailed knowledge of the physical and chemical character of thebeds that will be mined will be critical in the development of these resources. The value of so-phisticated processing techniques is enhanced if the variability in quality of the feedstock can bepredicted and controlled. Acquisition of this knowledge could be facilitated by cooperationamong private industry, public agencies, and research institutes. Industry has extensive data anda solid understanding of mining and processing problems, but often lacks the financial resourcesto undertake detailed geologic and engineering studies and to invest in development of new tech-nology. Public agencies and universities have expertise and technology that could be used in acooperative effort with industry to address these issues.SummaryThe Kentucky coal industry during fiscal year 1994-95 produced 162 million tons of coalwith a gross value of $3.9 billion.' Employment and revenue generated by industries supportingor servicing coal mining are vital to the coal-producing counties. The coal industry directly em- 7 Kentucky Coal Marketing and Export Council and the Kentucky Coal Association. (1995). Kentucky coal facts, 1995-1996(pocket guide). Also refer to Straus, et al. 171 154Exploring the Frontier of the Future ployed 24,133 miners earning $942.8 million in wages and salaries in 19948. All economic ac-tivity related to the coal industry generated $544 million in state tax revenues, representing morethan 11 percent of the fiscal year 1994-95 General Fund receipts of $4.6 billion' Of the $544million in state taxes, $180 million were severance taxes. Under provisions of the Local Govern-ment Economic Assistance Fund established by the General Assembly in 1980, a portion of coalseverance taxes is returned to counties.The economic contribution to coal counties and the state economy and General Fund areclearly substantial. In order to ensure the long-term economic stability of these counties and con-tinued state revenues from the coal industry, a careful assessment of factors affecting productionshould be undertaken. Historical trends are instructiveproduction rates have fluctuated as aresult of changes in demand for coal, availability of reserves, access to transportation infrastruc-ture, and development of new mining and processing technology. These factors will continue toaffect the economic strength and competitiveness of the industry in the future.Kentucky contains sufficient coal resources to support mining well into the future, butwhether these resources can be economically mined at competitive coal prices will depend onother factors. Most of the resource base is associated with relatively few coal beds. Some of thesecoal beds have been extensively developed in specific areas, and this may affect employmentdemographics in the near future. The resources that remain are more likely to be thinner, ofpoorer quality, or more challenging in terms of mining conditions. At the same time, surfacemining will continue to decline in importance relative to more costly underground methods.Future mining of less accessible and more complex coals and highly sophisticated processingand utilization cannot be achieved without an improved understanding of Kentucky's coal re-sources. Knowledge of the geologic characteristics associated with thin and deep seams will beessential to develop the necessary technology to extract and process these resources. Detailedchemical characterization of coals will provide the data necessary to assist industry to developstrategies for compliance with future regulation of combustion emissions. Perhaps of greater im-portance, characterization will provide valuable information about new techniques required tofurther process coal for specialty, high-value markets and will help identify the coal reserves withthe greatest potential for value-added processing.Most of the coal mined in Kentucky is sold out of state for electric power generation. Re-cently, competition in this market has begun to shift from a regional to a national basis. Thisadded competition has further depressed coal prices and resulted in low profit margins. Profit-ability has become increasingly dependent on producing larger quantities of coal. An alternativeto this marketing strategy is to identify specialty uses of coal, existing and novel, which may gen-erate significantly higher prices. While such efforts will not likely replace dependence on thesteam coal market, they can be used to position companies for success in an increasingly com-petitive market and may also provide international market opportunities.The coal resource base in Kentucky is substantial. It has supported extensive mining activitythroughout this century and will support mining well into the future. The technology used tomine and process the resource, the commodities produced, and the markets pursued in the futurewill likely be different from those in the past. Over time, emphasis will likely shift toward miningthin coal beds and deeper coal deposits. Less emphasis will likely be placed on surface miningand more emphasis will be placed on underground mining. Coal may be viewed not only as avital source of energy for electric power generation and combustion, but also as a valuable up-graded product that can be used in high-value, specialized markets in the chemical and otherindustries. As new market opportunities are identified and new technology employed in themining and processing of coal, there should be significant opportunities to capture the full eco-nomic benefits of the substantial remaining coal resources in Kentucky. s Oral communication, Kentucky Department of Employment Services.9 Straus, et al.2 The Volatile and Uncertain Outlook.for Tobacco in Kentucky Efforts to diversify sources of farm income have met with mixed success in Kentucky, with many farm-ers extremely dependent upon a crop with an uncertain future. Despite serious issues facing Kentucky to-bacco farmers, such as the regulatory and legal threats the industry faces, an expanding internationalmarket for U.S. tobacco and tobacco products has enabled the industry to survive and in some areas ac-tually grow during the 1990s. While the structure of tobacco farming in Kentucky will likely change sig-nificantly in the near future, a slowly declining domestic market coupled with overseas demand patternssuggest that the Kentucky tobacco industry will still be a viable economic sector in the years to come. By William M. SnellUniversity of KentuckyTobacco has long been an important agricultural commodity for Kentucky. But, it also hasbeen an extremely controversial one. The tobacco debate has intensified during the 1990s.Existing and proposed regulations and restrictions, excise tax increases, the smoking andhealth debate, social attitudes towards tobacco use, legal suits, and international competitionprovide much uncertainty for the future of the tobacco program, tobacco farming, and many ofKentucky's rural economies. Despite the serious issues facing Kentucky tobacco farmers, an ex-panding international market for U.S. tobacco and tobacco products has enabled the industry tosurvive, and in some areas, actually grow during the 1990s. Last year the U.S. tobacco industryestablished record highs for cigarette output, cigarette exports, and trade balance. Leaf importswere down considerably from earlier years, and growers received record high net market pricesfor their crop in 1995. Despite these achievements, though, many dark clouds remain above thetobacco industry. This chapter reviews recent trends in the Kentucky and U.S. tobacco industries,overviews the current U.S. tobacco situation and outlook, and discusses the potential implicationsof the current political, economic and legal issues facing the state's number one agriculturalcommodity.Kentucky's Tobacco Economy Much of Kentucky's rural economy has developed around the tobacco industry. Tobacco isgrown in 119 of the Commonwealth's 120 counties. More than 100 Kentucky counties will havetobacco sales exceeding $1 million this year. In several Kentucky counties, tobacco farming di-rectly accounts for more than 10 percent of the total personal income from all income sources.According to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) study, 17 of the nation's 20 most to-bacco-dependent counties are in Kentucky, most of them located in regions with limited off-farmemployment opportunities.Kentucky is the largest producer of burley and dark tobaccos and the nation's most tobacco-dependent state. While North Carolina grows more tobacco than Kentucky, tobacco accounts fora larger percentage of agricultural income in Kentucky relative to North Carolina. Tobacco gen-erally accounts for 40 percent to 50 percent of Kentucky's crop receipts and 20 percent to 30 per-cent of Kentucky's total agricultural cash receipts. The 1992 Census of Agriculture revealed thattobacco accounts for more than 40 percent of the net cash return from agricultural sales in Ken-tucky.173 156Exploring the Frontier of the Future Unlike other facets of agriculture, tobacco has generally remained connected with small fam-ily farms. According to the latest (1992) Census of Agriculture, 59,000 of Kentucky's 89,000farms grow tobacco. This represents nearly 50 percent of the total number of farms growing to- bacco in the United States. The average tobacco farm in Kentucky possesses 113 acres, withfewer than five acres of tobacco grown. While consolidation has been occurring over the past couple of decades, the concentra-tion of tobacco farms has occurredat a slower pace in Kentucky, rela-tive to other tobacco states.Kentucky'stobaccofarmershave experienced significant ad-versity over the past three decades.Governmentregulations,healthfindings,taxation,andforeigncompetitionhavecontinuedtothreaten the existence of the Ken-tuckytobaccoindustry.Despitethese challenges, the Kentucky to-bacco industry has survivedandactually grown. The value of to-bacco production in Kentucky hasaveraged $816 million during the1990s (1990-1995), compared to average of $705 million during the 1980s, $443 million duringthe 1970s, and $250 million during the 1960s. Based on projected production and prices, the1996 Kentucky tobacco crop will likely again exceed $800 million.Tobacco's economic impact reaches beyond the farm gate. Tobacco farmers purchase a widevariety of goods and services associated with producing the crop, and they utilize the cash gen-erated from the crop to generate additional economic activity in local agricultural and nonagri-cultural businesses. Total income multipliers reveal that every $1 million increase in Kentuckytobacco income generates a $3.7 million total (direct and induced) effect on the state's economy.Multipliers reveal that Kentucky tobacco production and processing accounts for around 5.7% ofthe state's total economy. Local, state and national governments receive more than $15 billion oftax revenues from the sale of tobacco products. (Kentucky's net excise tax collections from to-bacco product sales totals around $18 million.) In addition, the tobacco industry contributesaround $6 billion to the country's trade mix, which is currently in a deficit exceeding $100 bil-lion annually. Thus, the economic viability of tobacco production in Kentucky (and surroundingstates) reaches beyond the state's agricultural economy.FIGURE 16.1Value Production$1,200 $ 1 xclog $800 15$600%$400 $200 40 44 48 52 56 60 64 68 72 76 80 84 88 92YearSource: KY Agricultrual Statistics, 1996 estimates by author96 U.S. Tobacco Demand/Consumption TrendsApproximately 93 percent of the tobacco produced in Kentucky is burley tobacco, which isused primarily in the manufacturing of cigarettes. The remaining 7 percent of Kentucky's to-bacco production is comprised of dark air- and dark fire-cured tobaccos, which is used mainly insmokeless tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco consumption in the United States has been in-creasing in recent years, which has certainly benefited the agricultural economies in severalwestern Kentucky counties.U.S. cigarette consumption peaked in the early 1980s. During most of the 1980s and early1990s, cigarette consumption in this country declined 2 percent to 3 percent annually. Despite anescalated antitobacco movement, U.S. cigarette consumption leveled off in 1995 and appears tobe relatively flat in 1996. Stabilizing domestic cigarette consumption and soaring U.S. cigaretteexports resulted in U.S. cigarette production establishing a record high level in 1995, which isexpected to be surpassed in 1996.1 74 The Volatile and Uncertain Outlook for Tobacco in Kentucky 157 Higher cigarette output has increased the leaf requirements of domestic manufacturers. De-mand for domestic burley leaf was severely hampered during the .early 1990s with the increasinguse of imported tobacco to supply an increasing market for generic (value priced) cigarettes.However, the combination of domestic content legislation (requiring domestic manufacturers touse at least 75 percent U.S.-grown tobacco in their blends or face significant financial penalties),increasing cigarette output, and a reduc-tion in the market share of generic ciga-rette sales has strengthened the demandfor domestic tobacco. Although (in re-sponse to a GATT ruling) the domesticcontent law was replaced in 1995 by amuch less restrictive tariff rate quotasystem, imports, while increasing, cur-rently remain well below the record highlevels of the early 1990s.In addition to improvements in do-mestic demand for U.S. burley, exportdemand for U.S. burley is also on therise. Tight world burley supplies coupledwith an increasing demand for blendedcigarettes worldwide has enabled U Sburley exports to rebound in 1996. Collectively U.S. burley domestic use and export demand areexpected to total near 600 million pounds for 1996approximately the average level over thepast 25 years.800700600500a400 2001000FIGURE 16.2U.S. Cigarette Consumption andProduction, 1950-1996 50 53 56 59 62 65 68 71 74 77 80 83 86 89 92 95 Source: USDA=NM Consumption \"Production A Closer Look at International CompetitionThe international market presents both challenges and opportunities for the Kentucky tobaccoindustry. Despite increasing antitobacco efforts overseas, worldwide consumption of tobaccocontinues to growand it is growing more for burley tobacco than other tobacco types. This in-creasing world market has spawned much competition overseas, especially in certain developingcountries (e.g., Brazil, Argentina, Malawi, and Zimbabwe) where tobacco represents a majorsource of income and foreign exchange. While the volume of U.S. burley tobacco exported hasincreased over the years in response to a growing worldwide demand for the American-blendedcigarette, the United States has experienced a significant decline in world market share. Much ofthis can be attributed to increased priceand quality competition from foreigntobacco-producing nations.The current tight supply of burleytobacco in the world market is puttingupwardpressureonworldburleyprices. This situation, coupled withstable U.S. burley prices is resulting inan improved U.S. burley price com-petitive position. However, anticipatedproductionincreasesoverseaswilllikely cause the U.S./foreign price dif-ferential to increase in the near future.Thus foreign burley-producing coun-tries will likely be able to continue to increase their exports relative to the United States amidstthis price-conscious world tobacco market environment. But this growth will likely occur in mar-kets that presently, and for the foreseeable future, cannot afford U.S. tobacco. Thus, the United175FIGURE 16.3U.S. Burley Disappearance, 1960-1995 7Cs\u00b0 75 78 8184 87 90 93 Source: USDAD Domestic NI Exports 158Exploring the Frontier of the Future States may be able to sustain a consistent, dependablebut not growingniche market for high-quality burley tobacco. This assumes that the United States continues to have adequate exportsupplies available, addresses quality perception issues, and constrains export price growth.On the domestic front, farm leadership has reason for concern over future import levels. Thetariff rate quota import policy will provide domestic manufacturers with an opportunity to importa considerably higher level of burley and flue-cured tobacco than under the domestic content law.This relaxed trade policy environment coupled with increasing foreign burley supplies at morecompetitive prices will undoubtedly cause imports to increase in the near future. This situationwill be exacerbated by U.S. burley production shortfalls relative to the quota.Policy Issues Increasing international competition continues to force farm group leaders and policymakersto evaluate the provisions of the tobacco program. The U.S. tobacco program has arguably beenone of the most successful agricultural programs ever administered by the U.S. Department ofAgriculture. Unlike other agricultural programs, the tobacco program over the years has achievedthe original basic goal of providing price and income protection for a large number of small fam-ily farms without incurring large government outlays. However, the tobacco program has beenthe focus of attack for many years. Proposals to eliminate or dramatically alter the program arebrought up annually in the U.S. Congress. Earlier this year tobacco state lawmakers were suc- cessful in defeating a House of Representatives proposal to deny crop insurance and extensionservices to tobacco farmers by a margin of only two votes (212-210). The unprecedented 1996Farm Bill did not address the tobacco program as tobacco is under permanent legislation. Al-though the tobacco program \"operates\" as a no-net-cost program, farm group leaders are skepti- cal whether the tobacco program can survive amidst the changing federal farm policy environment.Abolishing the federal tobacco program would eliminate the value of the quota, representing amajor income loss to quota owners. Price volatility would increase significantly and U.S. tobaccoprices would fall by 20 percent to 25 percent or more without a production control/price supportprogram. A price decline of this magnitude would likely reduce the number of family farmsgrowing tobacco by more than 50 percent and would be devastating to many small rural com-munities that depend on tobacco income, but lack off-farm employment opportunities. Even withmuch lower and volatile prices, U.S. tobacco production without a tobacco program would likelyincrease in concentrated low-cost production areas, depending on the successful adoption oflower cost production technologies and the political/regulatory environment for tobacco. Theelimination of the tobacco program would also have adverse effects on land values, property taxbases, and the sale of agribusiness goods and services in certain rural areas. Without a tobaccoprogram, tobacco companies would have access to lower cost domestic and foreign leaf, resultingin slightly lower cigarette prices (and thus slightly higher cigarette sales) and/or higher tobacco company profits.The design of the tobacco program (i.e., price supports and production control) has been well-supported by the quota owners, producers, and the tobacco companies over the years. If the fed- eral program is eliminated, the question becomes: Can a production control/price support pro-gram be designed without governmental assistance (i.e., privately operated)? Program financingand maintaining effective production controls become critical and challenging issues surrounding a privatized program.External IssuesIn addition to international competition and program issues, perhaps the most serious threatscurrently facing Kentucky's tobacco industry are regulatory and legal. In August 1996, the Clin-ton Administration has granted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority to regulate176' The Volatile and Uncertain Outlook for Tobacco in Kentucky 159 tobacco products to reduce youth smoking. The tobacco companies and farm organizations havestated that they oppose youth access to tobacco products, but are fearful of FDA attempting togain broad jurisdiction over the sale of tobacco products to all consumers. In response to thisthreat, the tobacco industry is challenging FDA regulation in courts on the grounds that Congressnever intended for the FDA to regulate tobacco. Tobacco farm policymakers and some tobaccocompanies are supporting legislative efforts to address the youth smoking issue.The tobacco industry is also facing a large number of class action suits. The lawsuits accusetobacco companies of concealing evidence that smoking is addictive and manipulating nicotinelevels to \"hook\" smokers. In May, a federal appeals panel dismissed a potential multibillion dol-lar national class action suit against U.S. cigarette manufacturers. This issue now has been di-verted to a series of state class action suits.The outcome of these regulatory and legal issues facing the industry remains unclear. What isclear is that they could have a potentially devastating impact on the U.S. tobacco industry and theKentucky agricultural economy. What also is clear is that given the financial resources at risk,most of these issues will likely be tied up in court for many years to come.Diversification Efforts/LimitationsGiven the uncertainty of the tobacco program and the overall tobacco economy, tobacco farm-ers and farm organizations are examining and experimenting with diversification strategies tosupplement the potential decline in tobacco income. Tobacco farmers have been advised for dec-ades that they need to diversify, and many farming operations have. Despite various degrees ofdiversification, however, many remain extremely dependent upon a crop with a very uncertainfuture.Diversification in many parts of tobacco-growing regions is limited for a variety of reasons.The major reason cited by tobacco farmers is the profitability and the stability of returns for to-bacco relative to other enterprises. While some fruit and vegetable crops under favorable growingand marketing conditions may rival or even exceed the net returns of tobacco in some years, thereis no single crop. (or livestock) enterprise available that will consistently generate the level oftobacco returns for a large number of small family farms.Successful diversification efforts often also entail discovering and maintaining a niche marketfor some commodity. Additional competition by a few producers or sudden and unexpectedchanges in market windows may cause prices and profits in these markets to fall abruptly. Even ifsome farmers are willing to take on less profitable enterprises with more price risk, land charac-teristics (e.g. farm size, topography, soil quality), labor resource constraints, limited marketingoutlets, large capital investments, and the degree of management often limit many tobacco farm-ers from expanding or adopting new enterprises. For many tobacco farm families, diversificationor complete abandonment of tobacco production simply means part- or full-time employment offthe farm.Another potential reason cited for lack of diversification among tobacco farmers is age. Themajority of tobacco farmers are over 50 years of age. They have heard the likely downfall of to-bacco for decades, yet tobacco demand and use remains relatively high. Many of these tobaccofarmers are reluctant to invest in riskier enterprises that may have the potential to generate long-term returns comparable to tobacco. Some have attempted alternative crops in the past withmixed to poor results. Given their age, plus limited labor, capital and managerial resources, thesefarmers will allocate their resources to the enterprises that generate the greatest short-term eco-nomic return. For many, this enterprise mix continues to be led by tobacco.For some Kentucky farmers diversification strategies may include tobacco for use in alterna-tive or extended uses. According to scientists, the tobacco plant is one of the easiest and mosteconomical plants to manipulate genetically. Genetically engineered tobacco can be used in theproduction of various items including pharmaceuticals, vaccines, industrial enzymes, insecti-cides, and personal care products. Research and psoduct development using bioengineered to- 1 7 160Exploring the Frontier of the Future bacco are still very much in their infancy. Presently it appears evident that a market will developfor genetically engineered tobacco. However, with no established market at this time, it is diffi-cult to surmise the potential economic effects at the farm level. In the immediate future, it ap-pears that this technology will lead to a niche market for a small subset of tobacco growers tosupplement tobacco grown for traditional uses. The longer term prospects for tobacco farmers are still unclear.Despite the limitations facing tobacco farmers, some diversification is occurring beyond tra-ditional enterprises. Both the Kentucky Farm Bureau and the Burley Tobacco Grower's Coopera-tive have recently initiated programs that will likely enhance diversification opportunities forKentucky tobacco farmers. In addition, the state's Department of Agriculture and the Universityof Kentucky's College of Agriculture are allocating more resources towards agricultural diversifi-cation. These supplemental enterprise efforts will likely reduce Kentucky's dependence on to-bacco over an extended period.What Lies Ahead for the Kentucky Tobacco Industry?The tremendous amount of political, economic, legal, and social uncertainty surrounding thetobacco industry makes outlook projections for this controversial crop extremely difficult andrisky. The current factors shaping the tobacco outlook lead to more questions than answers.While the industry has experienced much volatility over the past couple of decades, the trendline for Kentucky burley quota since the early 1970s is basically flat at 400 million pounds. Darktobacco acreage allotments, while down in 1996, have rebounded considerably from their lows inthe 1980s. Thus, despite all the serious attacks on tobacco, Kentucky tobacco production has notdrastically declined as many have predicted over the years. But can the Kentucky tobacco indus-try survive in the future?Presently, tight world tobacco supplies and growing world demand are increasing the need forburley tobacco which may result in higher production quotas for Kentucky farmers in 1997. De-spite escalated educational campaigns on tobacco use and health, tobacco consumption continuesto grow modestly worldwide. This trend is not expected to reverse abruptly in the near future.Thus, demand for tobacco worldwide isexpected to remain near current recordlevels leading into the 21st century.However, tobacco consumption in tradi-tional markets for U.S. tobacco and to-bacco products is stagnant or declining.Most of the growth in the world marketis occurring in markets that presentlycannot afford U.S. tobacco or U.S. to-bacco products. Presently, U.S. demandis relatively strong in response to tightworld supplies. However, world burleyproductionisincreasing, which willeventually put pressure on farm group leaders to once again address price competition. Even ifthe farm leadership decides in the future to lower price supports for U.S. tobacco, it remainsquestionable whether U.S. burley producers collectively would increase supply to meet the antici-pated increase in demand. Thus, the ability of the U.S./Kentucky tobacco producer to take advan-tage of the growing world market is limited, given the current tobacco program and the coststructure of many existing growers.Domestically, additional taxation, regulation, and health issues will likely result in the indus-try reverting back to annual declines in U.S. cigarette consumption. Tobacco leaf imports underthe new tobacco trade policy have the potential once again to become a serious threat to the do-mestic tobacco grower. Furthermore, protection for the small family tobacco farm is jeopardizedFIGURE 16.4Kentucky's Basic Burley Quota, 1971-1996500450400 '635003525020015010050071 73 75 77 79 81 83 85 87 89 91 93 95 The Volatile and Uncertain Outlook for Tobacco in Kentucky 161 by the potential dismantling of the tobacco program. Finally, the legal challenges currently facingthe tobacco industry could eventually have very serious negative ramifications for the entire in-dustry.While it is difficult to estimate the potential economic effect of these issues facing the tobaccoindustry, we can expect that the factors mentioned above will induce a significant change in thestructure of tobacco farming in Kentucky and surrounding states leading into the 21st century.Increasing cost pressures and alternative resource opportunities will likely continue to erode in-terest in growing burley tobacco in Tennessee and North Carolina. Consolidation is occurringslowly for Kentucky's tobacco industry, but it is occurring and will continue. The number of farmquotas has declined from over 150,000 in the early 1990s to around 130,000 in 1996. The pace offuture consolidation hinges greatly on program changes and program survival. Obviously, theelimination of a price support/production control program will greatly accelerate tobacco farmconsolidation. Farm labor/barn space limitations, increasing off-farm employment opportunities,declining profitability of tobacco, the antitobacco movement, and the long-term outlook for to-bacco are collectively resulting in a declining interest in growing the crop in some areas of thestate. The number of tobacco producers will likely fall at an accelerated rate, with a continuingemphasis on part-time farming and off-farm employment. Livestock and horticultural productionwill likely receive additional attention in these traditional tobacco growing areas. While provingbeneficial to certain producers, it is unclear whether these supplemental/alternative agriculturalenterprises (suitable for the existing tobacco farm resources) will be able to generate large enougheconomic returns to sustain the majority of small to midsize family farms in these rural areas.Thus, the high cost of production in tobacco-dependent regions that are not able to lure attractiveoff-farm employment opportunities will likely be challenged in the future to achieve much addi-tional economic growth.Alternatively, the tobacco economies in the more efficient tobacco-growing regions of thestate may be able to compete quite effectively in a future environment of intense internationalcompetition and major changes (or possibly elimination) of the U.S. tobacco program. The nichemarket for high-quality U.S. burley may enable some Kentucky tobacco farmers to maintain cur-rent tobacco production or perhaps increase production under a program elimination scenario.Quality is still a major factor in determining manufacturer purchasing patterns. Premium ciga-rette sales have been increasing the past several years in the United States relative to genericcigarettes which should aid domestic growers. Furthermore, the anticipated increase in purchas-ing power in various parts of the world will likely continue to boost the demand for competitivelypriced/higher quality cigarettes. Although tobacco leaf quality has improved overseas, the grow-ing and curing conditions in Kentucky still provide Kentucky farmers with a distinct quality ad-vantage over their competitors in other parts of the world. The questions' now become how largeof a market and what is the quality price premium?Thus, while the structure of tobacco farming in Kentucky will likely change significantly inthe near future, a slowly declining domestic market coupled with overseas demand patterns sug-gest that the Kentucky tobacco industry will still be a viable economic sector in the years to come.This does not suggest that the Kentucky tobacco economy will once again approach the record $1billion crop of 1982. But the niche demand for Kentucky's tobacco in the world market willlikely enable the industry to achieve $500 to $900 million crops in the immediate future. (Asdetailed above, though, this income will be concentrated in fewer farming operations in the futurewhich certainly presents challenges to policymakers and community leaders in areas lacking off -farm employment opportunities). However, even this potential outcome is immensely dependenton the uncertain future political, regulatory and legal actions affecting the U.S./Kentucky tobaccoindustries. 179 Negotiating the New Social Contract The terms of today's employee-employer contract have become far less favorable for workers, creatingincome inequities, critical gaps in health and retirement provisions, and, some argue, structural unem-ployment. While the current drift of employer practices would appear to portend a bleak future for worker-employer relations, research suggests a far different approach is needed. Further, organized political re-sponses to current trends appear to be well underway. By Michal Smith-MelloKentucky Long-Term Policy Research CenterThe uncertainties that attend much of postmodern life are perhaps most pronounced in theworkplace where the relationship between employers and employees is undergoing con-siderable change. Workers, enterprises, industries and whole economies are being rockedby the destabilizing effects of global competition, technological advancement, and the structuralchanges they have compelled. While a transformed marketplace has helped liberate millions ofworkers from autocratic management systems, the drive to remain competitive has also led torelentless cost-cutting. Labor, which comprises an estimated 70 percent of all production costs,'has been an easy, first-strike target. Millions of jobs have been outsourced, marginalized to part-time or contract status, or eliminated altogether; the buying power of wages has remained stag-nant for two decades; and the benefits that once enabled health and retirement security haveeroded. As a consequence, some observers have pronounced the social contract irretrievably bro-ken. Clearly, a far more tenuous agreement, one that shifts many responsibilities previously as-sumed by employers to workers, is influencing employment practices nationally.The weakening social contract, however, is only part of the dichotomous world of work. Eco-nomic anxiety now coexists with dramatic organizational change that is fostering more demo-cratic, participatory work environments and collaborative partnerships between managers andworkers. While exhilarating to many, the assumption of new responsibilities and roles that comeswith such change is troubling to others, producing yet another reservoir of work-related anxiety.Research, however, shows that the shift to \"high-performance\" organizations enables higher re-turns by enriching and routinely tapping the knowledge of front-line workers. A 1995 literaturereview for the U.S. Department of Labor concluded, \"The evidence for employee developmentpractices as a significant driver of productivity and profitability appears firm.\"'The process of adaptation to these often contradictory changes is expected to continue un-abated for years to come. While the current drift of corporate' employment practices would seemto portend a disappearing social contract between employers and employees, the ethical and eco-nomic validity of these strategies is being broadly challenged. At the same time, widespread pub-lic disapproval is giving rise to organized responses. Some optimistically predict that economicgrowth will neutralize simmering resentments, a scenario which the present health of the econ-omy makes more plausible. Regardless of what unfolds, the ground rules for this uncertain play-ing field will likely be a subject of debate for years to come.The dilemma at the center of the dialogue, suggests Carnevale, is how to preserve neededflexibility in our economy and labor market and, at the same time, provide people with a \"tool I Blinder, A.

Throughout modern history, the U.S. governmenthas helped fill gaps in support when individuals were unable to work, to find work or, more typi-cally in recent years, to achieve self-sufficiency through work. But the demands on governmentscontinue to rise. In response, suggests Kapstein, governments around the world are trying to\"break their postwar deal with workers while maintaining their commitment to an open econ-omy.\" Instead, he suggests, the focus should be on \"negotiating a package that helps workersadjust to ongoing economic change.'\" The pressure for such a package, for structural responses tothe growing gap between work and well-being, will almost certainly continue to mount.In the absence of sustained and rising economic growth, the terms of today's weakened socialcontract may result in massive unmet public need over the long term. Ultimately, we must de-termine when and how to engineer responses to unmet needs and how to pay for them. For theforeseeable future, this difficult reckoning will be the subject of a continuing dialogue that willnot easily nor quickly yield solutions. Nevertheless, the issues at stake in the new social contractpresent the nation's most formidable challenge, one policymakers can ill afford to ignore.An Expanding Pie, Smaller PiecesSince 1970, the United States has been mired in what economist Thomas I. Palley calls a\"Leaden Age\" during which economic growth has been accompanied by the persistence ofseemingly incompatible forcesfalling wages and rising employment' Even during the 1992-93recovery, Mishel, Bernstein and Schmitt report, the median U.S. family income declined whileunemployment fell and gross domestic product expanded.6 Ordinarily, today's low unemploymentrates would exert upward pressure on wages, but, until recently, that pressure has been isolatedregionally and occupationally and has remained negligible overall. Only in the past 18 monthshas inflation-adjusted personal and business income begun to show sustained and significantrates of growth,' what some see as a sign that \"public tolerance of wage stagnation is reaching itslimits.\"8In spite of today's good economic news, underlying anxiety about the future is not likely todissipate soon. Today, whole classes of workers are benefiting only marginally or not at all froman economy that has created millions of jobs and propelled the stock market to record heights.And, in spite of formal reports of low unemployment, evidence of structural unemployment ismounting nationally and internationally. In spite of the buoyancy of the moment, Freeman sug-gests, the American economy bears a disturbing resemblance to that of a Third World nation\"where the wealthy and powerful prosper while the less well-off struggle.\"'Nevertheless, Americans are cautiously optimistic about the general trend of today's econ-omy, a rather remarkable mood swing that occurred in just a few months. A February 1996 Busi-ness Week/Louis Harris and Associates poll found that only 50 percent of Americans saw bettertimes ahead, compared to 59 percent of survey respondents in 1989.'\u00b0 By September, Americanswere buoyed by sustained economic growth and wage gains.

During the 1990s, the Economic PolicyInstitute reports, U.S. workers have experienced the worst rate of job losses since World War II,and, on average, workers lose 15 percent of their income on the next job, while a quarter of laid-off workers have no health insurance.\" To no one's surprise, nearly half (46 percent) of employ-ees of large corporations are \"frequently concerned\" about being laid off, up from 44 percent in1994, and 31 percent in 1992.\"Inspite of economic uncer-tainty,consumerconfidenceasmeasured by spending has lifted outof the doldrums to reach a six-yearhigh.\" But, for many, this releaseof pent-up consumerism may haveless to do with purchasing powerthanithas to do with erodingbenefits and frustration with inac-cessibility to a consumer society. Inresponse, more and more Ameri-cans live beyond their means bypiling on credit card debt. In turn,personal bankruptcies have reachedtheir highest quarterly point inhistory!' Bankruptcy court officialspredict that as many as 1 millionAmericans may go broke this year.\" In Kentucky, where a record pace of filing is underway,court officials and attorneys for the newly bankrupt attribute a growing portion of claims tomedical bills the uninsured or underinsured cannot pay.'Indeed, the benefits that stand between millions of Americans and bankruptcy are as uncer-tain as the jobs to which they were once routinely tied. The Employee Benefit Research Institutereports that an estimated 61 million non-elderly Americans had no health insurance during agiven week in 1995.20 Among those most likely to be without health insurance were the self-employed and employees from a range of industries that have historically sponsored benefits.The future appears to offer even less certainty. In 1992, according to the Census Bureau, onlyan estimated 40 percent of the U.S. civilian labor force was covered by a pension plan,2' signalinga looming deficit in retirement incomes. Employers have divested enterprises of many responsi-bilities for health care and pension provisions, trimming benefit packages, shifting more respon-sibility to workers, sometimes abandoning commitments to retirees altogether, and hiring morecontract and part-time personnel who must fend for themselves. So far, government has declinedto fill the void or to make pensions more portable. Indeed, the recent national political debate isone of which services to jettison in order to balance the budget, rather than how it can close wid-ening gaps.FIGURE 17.1Bankruptcy Filings, Eastern and Western Districtsof U.S. District Court, Kentucky, 1985-199612,000 10,000 8,000 6,000 4,000 2,0000 Western DistrictMt Eastern District 01985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996**Projections based on filings in the first six months of 1996.Source: U.S. District Court for Eastern Kentucky and The Courier-Journal 12 Mandel.

[On-line] Available: www.medacess.comicensus/9420588.htm.182 166Exploring the Frontier of the Future For many, the gap between today's wages and the quality of life work once afforded is widen-ing. Nearly 20 percent of the year-round U.S. labor force earns too little money to escape pov-erty,\" and, the Census Bureau reports, the rich continue to get richer while economiccircumstances remain much the same for the poor and the middle class.\" Between 1984 and1994, average household income rose just 1 percent, but for those at the bottom of the earningsladder, the poorest one-fifth of households, income rose at a glacial pace of one-tenth of a percenta year. Meanwhile, the top one-fifth of households realized a 20 percent gain in income.\" Recentstudies commissioned by the bipartisan federal Competitiveness Policy Council found that aver-age hourly wages adjusted for inflation are now $120 lower than their peak in 1973.23To add insult to injury for workers, the compensation packages of U.S. CEOs, many of whomordered layoffs, jumped 92 percent between 1990 and 1995, while worker pay inched upward 16percent.\" In 1995, the pay of the average U.S. CEO was 141 times that of the ordinary factoryworker,\" a circumstance Reich refers to as \"the tinder for mass resentment of business elites.\"\"With the announcement of every major layoff, Reich observes, \"a chill is sent through the livingrooms and kitchens of millions of American homes . .. To the extent that we're concerned aboutsocial tranquillity, that sense of insecurity is a real cost.'29Beneath today's official U.S. jobless statistics, Thurow argues, lies a sea of unemployed andunderemployed workers. National unemployment rates are based on the Current Population Sur-vey, which examines a pool of survey subjects during rotating time periods. In April 1996,Thurow estimated the real U.S. unemployment rate at around 14 percent and concluded that asmuch as one-third of the workforce \"is potentially looking for more work than they now have.\"\"Among those in search of more work are discouraged workers, underemployed contingent andpart-time workers, legal immigrants, and an estimated 5.8 million working-age men who are nolonger reflected on formal employment or unemployment rolls.3'Thurow and others have advocated a new approach to managing the U.S. economy, one thatrejects what they argue are baseless fears of inflation and permits higher rates of growth and alevel of jobs creation that will eliminate the slackand some of the underlying tensionsin to-day's labor market. That slack, they argue, is holding wages in check. Many economists adhereto a counter theory of a natural unemployment rate, estimated at around 6 percent. Below thenatural rate, it is argued, inflation is triggered. But the stalled growth of wages in an era of lowformal unemployment brings the theory into question. Galbraith argues, \"The model is junk,'32and only \"a macroeconomic commitment to full employment\"\" will achieve higher living stan-dards. As Thurow observes, \"In a world where there are always millions of unemployed and un-deremployed workers, firms do not have to pay efficiency wages. The same degree of cooperation,commitment, and effort can be achieved by using the motivation factor called 'fear' the fear ofbeing thrown into this enormous sea of unemployment and underemployment.\"\" 22 Snyder, D.P.

The American Prospect,63.33 Galbraith, 64.34 Thurow, 57.18,3 Negotiating the New Social Contract 167 One manifestation of the fear to which Thurow refers is discernible in the sharp decline inworker protests. While good news for the smooth flow of commerce, a once traditional path ofworker protest has been effectively silenced. According to the Federal Mediation and Concilia-tion Service (FMCS), the number of U.S. strikes in 1995 fell by 20 percent from the previousyear, marking the lowest number of walkouts since World War II.\"FMCS attributes the low rateof national strike activity to the decline of unions, the stability created by long-term union-management pacts, and the threat and use of striker replacements. As illustrated, the number ofwork stoppages in Kentucky has alsotrendeddownwardsince1980.While the trend may signal a newharmony in unionized workplaces, italso reflects a diminished voice ofprotest in the face of what manyunion members view as economiccoercion.As a consequence of the trendsin unemployment, income and criti-cal benefits, work no longer lends asense of certainty to the lives of mil-lions of Americans and their fami-lies.Instead,ithas become yetanother source of anxiety. While workplace change promises liberation from the autocratic man-agement systems of the past, many simply worry about having and keeping a job and the benefitsthat shield them from financial ruin. While prospects for the best-educated workers remainbright, a burgeoning class of workers is being relegated to monotonous, potentially injurious,low-wage jobs\" that offer little opportunity for betterment, much less the promised nirvana ofempowerment.70so50403020100FIGURE 17.2Work Stoppages in Kentucky, 1985-1995 19801982198419881988199019921994Source: Kentucky Labor Cabinet Grim Visions of Future WorkIn the world of work, some envision an evolutionary process that will eventually dissolve theemployer-employee bond as we know it. The doomsaying theorists who predict the end of formal,lasting links to employers suggest that workers, particularly highly educated \"knowledge\" work-ers, will become far more autonomous, attached to projects rather than employers, and responsi-ble for negotiating their own long-term fates. Employers will reduce labor forces to only a core ofhighly educated and highly skilled professionals who will orchestrate a continuous flow of workperformed by outside contractors. As Wysocki reports for the Wall Street Journal, \"high-technomads\" are already proliferating in our economy, partly because corporate downsizing hasdecimated the ranks of data-processing professionals.\" While their services are much in demand,some are paying a high price in terms of lost free time, financial uncertainty and stress.\"If the emerging class of nomads represents the wave of the future, employees will assume fullresponsibility for skill development and for cultivating work opportunities and the income theyproduce, as well as the benefits they enable, including health care and retirement. And employerswill become dependent upon the unpredictable availability of qualified workers in order to main-tain stability and continuity in their businesses. What's more, the American family will undergoyet another shock, as nomadic workers are separated from family for long periods of time andexperience recurring fluctuations of income, the sustained consequences of which, some re- \" Greenhouse, S.

Lessons from our immediate past, however,suggest that, carried to the extreme, the Lessons from our immediate past, however, dissolution of employer support andsuggest that, carried to the extreme, the commitment to employees is unwork-dissolution of employer support and able,unsustainableandpotentiallydestructive. Ultimately, the vision of commitment to employees is unworkable, free-floating workers who experience unsustainable and potentially destructive. only temporary attachments to isolatedprojects is one of a society acceptingand adapting to the wholesale abandonment of the patriarchal employer model. While many ofthe characteristics of this model are now widely and appropriately viewed as patronizing anddemeaning, the role of responsible partnership is not. Indeed, research suggests that employercommitment to progressive human resource policies is not only good for employee relations butgood for business. Employment security is central to that commitment.The Illusive Promise of Workplace DemocracyThe diminishing certainty of work is also undermining confidence in workplace change thatholds enormous potential for broad benefits. In spite of the presence of many sincere and mutu-ally beneficial initiatives, employees remain wary. Trust, which is key to the success of workplacechange initiatives and, Fukuyama argues, a nation's economic well-being,\" has been severelyundermined by the instability and insecurity of today's job market. As labor historian NelsonLitchenstein observes, \"You cannot have an island of cooperation in a sea of antagonism.\"'While the various iterations of organizational change have become ubiquitous in U.S. work-places, Kochan and Osterman estimate that only about one-third of the nation's employers haveformally adopted one or more human resource practices that enable mutual gain, which they ar-gue is key to the advancement of high-performance work organization.\" Instead, many employersare adopting the language of organizational change without making a real commitment to em-ployees. Success, instead, hinges on human resource practices that cultivate, enrich and rewardthe irreplaceable contribution of employees.Employer responses to competitive pressures are undermining the factors researchers cite askey to high-performance organization. Only in recent months have the substantial gains realizedfrom rising productivity and the profits it has enabled begun to make their way into the wages ofworkers. But the trust on which high-performance organization hinges is being systematicallyundermined by growing employer indifference to job security. The effects could be far reaching.High-performance organizations are more likely to be engaged in the international marketplace,to use high-skill technology and to emphasize quality and service.\" They are, therefore, far morelikely to succeed in the global economy and survive over the long term.The coexistence of a cruel economy and conciliatory workplace processes has provided abun-dant fodder for chroniclers of contemporary life. Cartoonist Scott Adams, for example, lampoonsthe hollow absurdities of faddish, essentially dishonest workplace initiatives. For \"Dilbert\" andcolleagues, empowerment is, at best, a path to increased workloads, and, at worst, the freedom to 39 Koretz, G. (1995, March 20). Why incomes grew less equal.

Edwards Deming hadin mind when he exhorted companies to drive fear out of the workplace. Workers may be laugh-ing at the antics of Dilbert's hapless corporation, but the fear and cynicism that informs its hu-mor are indicative of the damage done to the social contract and to a movement which promisedto reinvent employer-employee relations.Because trust is central to an enterprise's ability to perform over the long term and in a dra-matically changed context, the present state of employee-employer relations does not appear to besustainable. America's preeminence in the world marketplace is no longer a foregone conclusion,but rather an ongoing challenge, one that will not easily be met by divided enterprises, nor by ademoralized, ill-prepared workforce. Consequently, diminishing employer support for workersand anemic employee loyalty appear to be systemic flaws that ultimately will compel a rethinkingof the uniquely American social contract.Assigning BlameNot surprisingly, the current climate of economic insecurity has engendered considerablespeculation about the causes of economic malaise, but few political solutions. That void, concludeTeixeira and Rogers, is fueling voter anger, particularly among noncollege-educated workers.\"Further, Kapstein observes, \"If the post-World War II social contract with workers of full em-ployment and comprehensive social welfare is to be broken, political support for the burgeoningglobal economy could easily collapse.\" As the political debate sours, he adds, \"Populists anddemagogues of various stripes will find 'solutions' to contemporary economic problems in pro-tectionism and xenophobia.\"\"Already, frustrated, angry workers, particularly those in coastal and border states, are levelingblame for job losses and wage erosion at imports and immigrants, rather than the faceless eco-nomic forces of technology, demographics, and increased government transfers to the elderly, towhich some researchers pinblame for rising inequities.\"\"If the post-World War II social contract withCarnevalesuggestsimmi-workers of full employment and comprehensivegrants will be the first targetsocial welfare is to be broken, political support forof the backlash when itar-the burgeoning global economy could easily collapse.\" rives, one that could effec-tively seal the U.S. borders.\"'In response to this generalized anger, legislation aimed at severely restricting aid to legal immi-grants recently passed in Congress. Global commerce and trade agreements have also inspiredorganized opposition from labor unions and fueled divisive campaign rhetoric, but the evidencesuggests that sealing our borders would do little to change economic circumstances.\"More recently, the media have also brought corporate practices, particularly downsizing andCEO compensation, into much sharper focus. The controversy has touched off a debate aboutcorporate responsibilities and, more broadly, the purpose of the economy. Former Scott PapeermCEO Al Dunlap has emerged as a chief defender of downsizing. \"The people who are laid off arelaid off because there aren't jobs for them. To keep those people on the payroll, in fact, jeopard-izes the jobs of the rest of the workers,\" Dunlap argues. Avishai concurs that companies cannotguarantee lifetime employment to employees.

Respondents to a February 1996 poll gave corporate America bad reviews on virtuallyevery front, on wage fairness, employee training, job security, employee loyalty, creating good jobopportunities, planning for the future, and caring about what's good for the country. Only thequality of American products garnered a favorable assessment.\" What's more, 88 percent ofthose polled said the federal government should reward companies that create and preserve jobsand train workers while 67 percent endorsed penalties in the form of higher taxes for companiesthat eliminate jobs, close plants or provide their executives with extremely high compensation.\"Whether the much-publicized practices of prominent U.S. firms represent the product of logi-cal and necessary streamlining that is, as Gilder suggests, \"crucial to growth\"\" or the abandon-ment of larger responsibilities to society, the end product remains the same. An economicedginess pervades our lives. It is eroding trust between employers and employees, and causingmany to seek someone or something to blamea target for their anger. That, observes trade un-ion economist Robert Blackwell, \"makes for social divisions that are going to breed politicalmovements that compromise the environment within which businesses exist.'\"''Backlash or New Beginning?The economic inequities of today's marketplace are giving rise to organized political re-sponses, many of which are well underway. While recent economic indicators suggest that theeconomic tide may finally be turning for workers, it could be too late to counter a long simmeringbacklash. What Reich terms the \"coping mechanisms\" many American families have adopted tostay afloatincreased female labor force participation, longer hours and multiple jobsmayhave run their course.\" Many see a point of explosion nearing on the horizon.\" Carnevale pre-dicts, \"The action-forcing event will be the next recession or the next or the next one after that.\"\"Clearly, the logical champion for economic justice would ordinarily be labor unions, but theirranks have thinned to an estimated' 11 percent of the labor force nationally, effectively neutraliz-ing a key counterbalance to business and industry. Because trade unions have been an historicfeature of democracy, Litchenstein suggests that the decline of unions in the United States is noless than \"a high-stakes gamble.\"\" Already, research attributes one-fifth of income inequality to the decline of labor unions.\"While pundits have administered last rites to unions more than once, the AFL-CIO is under-going dramatic change and redirection.

Non-profit organizations are championing new approaches to devel-opment, as well as organized responses to economic inequities in communities throughoutKentucky and around the nation. Over the past two years, for example, organized communityefforts have helped push the minimum wage issue onto legislative agendas in 33 states and mar-shaled ballot initiatives that could put the issue before voters in seven other states.\"Readily available information about what works in other highly successful economies is alsolikely to inform future negotiations of the social contract. The Japanese social cOntiact, for ex-ample, is a binding lifetime agreement, one that was consciously crafted as part of a post-WorldWar II plan for economic revival.\" Lifetime employment and, later, informal employment cartelsthat discourage competition for workers, shaped a radically different and highly successful em-ployer-employee relationship.\" As a consequence of the conscious effort to craft a mutuallybeneficial and relatively harmonioussystem, employee loyalty is assured, Japanese chief executives are compensated ateven enforced, and absenteeism is only about 10 times the pay of the lowest levelvirtuallynonexistent.Freefromworker and, rather than eliminate jobs, the competition for workers, companiesinvest far more in research and de- effects of economic distress are shared broadly.velopment and in their employees.Moreover, Japanese chief executives are compensated at only about 10 times the pay of the lowestlevel worker and, rather than eliminate jobs, the effects of economic distress are shared broadly.\"While the carefully constructed Japanese system inhibits worker mobility, the relative disloyaltyof American workers has served to constrain employer investments in critical training and edu-cation.\"Though Japan's economy has been rocked by a protracted recession in recent years, the cen-tral tenet of lifetime employment appears to have survived this test of fire. Japan has emerged asthe one nation to go against international trends toward structural unemployment.\" Its modernpost-World War II experiences offer an example of the conscious and successful construction of amore balanced and broadly beneficial social contract. In the coming years, U.S. policymakers arelikely to be challenged to construct a system that is less adversarial, more cooperative, and mu-tually beneficial. Parks notes that the capital market effectively discourages employer investmentin costly trust-building initiatives because investors are at a disadvantage in an economy thatstresses short-term results.\" If this misallocation of resources ultimately has a significant impact,Parks suggests, \"a national policy to alter the institutional framework is often necessary.\"\"In the future, organized responses can be expected to exert significant leverage in the politicalsphere. Whether that leverage results in a more equitable social contract or mere scapegoating isyet to be seen. Policymakers, however, can expect the pressure for greater economic equity tocontinue rising so long as constructive responses are absent from the political landscape. 62 Homblower, M. (1996, June).

Macro-economic circumstances and, some argue, corporate and government policies are driving a wedgebetween employers and employees, whose cooperation and mutual trust are central to our abilityto compete and prosper. As a consequence, we may be destined to relive past mistakes, to experi-ence yet another swing of the pendulum that will ignite conflict before a new order is established.While the process of establishing a new order is likely to be a protracted one, the quality ofthe future before us continues to depend upon timely attention to circumstances that threaten ad-verse long-term outcomes. Instead, we are immersed in an era of public and private divestment ofresponsibility for economic well-being. As a result, an enormous gulf is emerging. Nevertheless,advanced societies, suggests Nobel Laureate Jerome Karle, must act. \"The world ... cannot pos-sibly benefit from continued procrastination ... or wait for the results of endless debate and de-liberation. Too much debate and little testing is as bad for societies as it is for science?\"'A number of indicators suggest that a protracted unwillingness to act, to experiment, to teststrategies for solving the economic problems that breed social problems, could have disastrouslong-term effects. Already, the gulf between rich and poor poses a threat to social stability and tothe future health and productivity of the children who will sustain tomorrow's economy. Indeed,continued inattention to the economic well-being of workers at the bottom of the earnings ladder,whose economic circumstances have worsened over the past two decades, will likely perpetuate and even extend the reach of poverty. The children of the poor are far more likely to remaintrapped in cycles of poverty that will cost each of us. In short, flaws in the social contract betweenemployers and employees are not only undermining the economic and social circumstances offamilies and individuals today, they are jeopardizing future social and economic well-being.Clearly, the changes underway in our society are profound, perhaps unimaginable in terms oftheir long-term consequences. Psychologist and management theorist William Berquist suggeststhat the organizations of our economy will not likely readjust and simply return to some previousform in a predictable pendulum fashion. Instead, he posits, \"We are now entering into an era offire, during which old organizational forms, structures, and processes will be consumed .. .\"\"But Berquist cautions that the reordering must be informed by the wisdom of the past. \"We mustreturn to premodern perspectives regarding the sacred nature of human organizations, and onceagain listen to enlightening stories regarding our own human history and destiny. Only in thisway can we successfully tend the complex and irreversible fires of the postmodern world?\"'As both Drucker and Berquist suggest, the future, post-fire state of today's tenuous socialcontract between employer and employee cannot be predicted with certainty. Instead, it willgradually be shaped by losses and gains, by experience and experimentation. Workers face theimmense challenge of reclaiming a voice which has been lost in the din of our rush to adapt tostructural economic change. The challenge to employers, who have seized the balance of power in today's economy, is to learn from the enlightening stories of our past as well as the best prac-tices of today and to rediscover the power of mutual trust and commitment. For policymakers, the\"stories\" told by research and experience can help fashion a new social contract, one that affordsgreater economic security and advances social well-being. Jointly, workers, employers and poli-cymakers can and must forge a new social infrastructure to help ensure that the \"new society\" isalso a much better one. 71Karle, J. (1996).

Over the course of thedecade, the distribution of income shares for Kentuckians at the lowest income levels was less than thenation's at the same level while the income share for Kentuckians at the highest income level was greaterthan the top quintile for U.S. households. Possible expkinations for the increase in the inequality of thedistribution of income include demographic trends, which may exaggerate changes in income distribution;the decline in unionization; and technological progress, which rewards highly skilled labor and placesabundant low-skill labor at a comparative disadvantage in the global economy. By Amitabh ChandraUniversity of KentuckyDiscussions about the deterioration of U.S. income equality have become increasinglyprevalent in the popular press, as well as among academics. However, such debates are arelatively new addition to the usual issues that dominate the polemics of economic policyand performance. A review of the literature of income inequality in the United States prior to1980 presents a surprising consensus among leading economists on several issues. First, it wasagreed that the distribution had essentially stayed the same over time. Henry Aaron viewed thestationary complexion of the distribution since WWII as being about as interesting as \"watchinggrass grow.\"' Aaron's phrasing had two meanings: (1) growth in incomes had occurred at alllevels in the United States, and (2) the study of income distribution was boring because it was notchanging. Related to these conceptions was an optimism that the decade of the 1980s would seean improvement in the shape of the distribution, as a result of a more comprehensive incomesupport system, an improved and equitable tax code, and a decline in labor market rigidities. Adecade later, however, this enthusiasm underwent considerable revision as research by Lynn Ka-roly, Kevin Murphy, and others documented expanding wage inequality through the 1980s as aresult of increasing returns to skill and changing demographic composition?This paper examines some of the changes in income and wage distribution in Kentucky forthe period 1980-1990, using data from the U.S. Decennial Census of Population and Housing for1980 and 1990, and the Current Population Survey (CPS). It attempts to document the extent towhich the distribution of income inequality in the Commonwealth changed during the decadeunder review, and offers several theoretical explanations for factors that might be responsible forthe observed changes. The paper concludes with a normative discussion of why policymakersshould (or should not) care about the distribution of income inequality in the Commonwealth. Inthis chapter, three specific questions are addressed. First, did the distribution of income worsendramatically for Kentucky during the decade of the 1980s, compared to the nation as a whole?Second, to what extent did Kentucky's performance follow the nation's? Finally, what possibleexplanations might account for changes in the income distribution? I am grateful to Dr. Mark C. Berger and Dr. Dan A.

Journal of Political Economy, 101,410-42.190 174Exploring the Frontier of the Future The possible answers to these questions have generated significant interest and speculation.While much is known about the deterioration of the income distribution at the level of the aggre-gate U.S. economy, little research exists at the state level. This article offers some answers bysummarizing the results of a systematic analysis of the dynamics of income distribution in Ken-tucky. Before developing this analysis further, I will first explain some theoretical concepts thatare used in discussions of income inequality and discuss several salient features of the two datasources that I have used in this study.Theoretical Preliminaries There are two principal concepts that are useful tools in discussions of income inequality. Thefirst is the notion of percentiles. Imagine that all households in the Commonwealth could beranked on the basis of their incomes. The top 1 percent of households would comprise the 99thpercentile, and the top 2 percent of households would comprise the 98th and 99th percentiles ofthe household income distribution. Similarly, the statistical concept of quintiles is that of five,usually equal portions of a frequency distribution. It is important to note that a person's percen-tile or quintile ranking will depend on whether the unit of observation is a household or individ-ual; it is conceivable for individuals with low earnings to be part of high-quintile households.Economists researching the distribution of income typically study households or individualsranked in terms of quintiles instead of percentiles for efficiency reasons. Studying five groups ofpeople is considerably more efficient than studying a hundred.Another measure of income inequality is often illustrated in a \"Lorenz Curve,\" an example ofwhich is found in Figures 18.1a and 18.1b. If households, or workers, are ranked from lowest tohighest on the basis of their incomes, then the Lorenz curve plots the cumulative percentage ofhouseholds against the cumulative percentage of income received by these households. Under a perfectly egalitarian system, the Lorenz curve would be a straight line, with the bottom quintilereceiving 20 percent of total income, the bottom 40 percent receiving 40 percent of income, andso forth. In the analysis that follows, the concepts of percentiles, quintiles and Lorenz curves willbe used extensively.DataThe data used in this analysis comes from two sources. First, the U.S. Decennial Census ofPopulation and Housing from 1980 and 1990 is used to examine household level changes in the distribution of income. It is supplemented with individual level microdata from the CurrentPopulation Survey (CPS) to assess changes in the distribution of individual earnings. An impor-tant but subtle difference between income and earnings should be noted. Income refers to the sum of wages from all jobs, self-employment income, interest and dividend payments, pension andwelfare payments. Earnings represent the sum of wages from all jobs, and net business income.Here, we study the distribution of \"income\" with the Census data, and the distribution of \"earnings\" with the CPS data. The CPS outgoing rotation data have no measures of the othercomponents of income, a limitation which precludes their direct comparison to the Census data.However, given that earnings are the largest component of income, identifying changes in thedistribution of earnings allows us to isolate factors that may, or may not, be driving the distribu-tion of earnings. For example, if we were to find that the distribution of income worsened consid-erably (using Census data), and that there were no corresponding degeneration in the distribution of wages (using CPS data), we could comfortably conclude that changes in dividend income,rental income, or transfer payments must have caused the increase in income inequality. 191 Income Inequality in Kentucky -175 The CPS, which is the official source of the U.S. government's unemployment statistics, is amonthly survey of almost 60,000 households in almost 700 different geographic areas.3 Respon-dents to the CPS are included in the survey for four months, excluded for eight months, and thenincluded again for four months. Questions pertaining to earnings and hours worked are asked ofrespondents in the \"outgoing rotations,\" i.e., those workers at the end of their 4th and 16thmonths in the survey. The use of the CPS data allows for a year-to-year comparison of changes inthe distribution of earnings, and is therefore a useful complement to studies pursued with Censusdata. In this analysis, current dollars have been converted to real dollars using the CPI-UX1 asthe appropriate price deflator.What Happened to Income Distribution in the 1980s?The Lorenz curves in Figures18.1A and 18.1B were generatedusing Censusdata,and in the income distributionof all households in Kentucky andthe United States. In addition, Ta-ble 18.1A and Table 18.1B showthe underlying income distributionfor other demographic groups inKentucky and the United States,including black and white house-holds, as well as rural and urbanhouseholds. While the income dis-tribution did deteriorate during the1980s, the regression was not assevere as previously thought. A common pattern emerges from the data. The dispersion in thedistribution appears to be more pronounced between the 50th and 80th percentiles than anywhereelse. Further, the distribution remained almost unchanged for households below the 20th per-centile.Table 18.1A reports summaryincome shares received by variousquintile levels for the groups understudy in Kentucky. Table 18.1B re-produces the same statistics for theUnited States.Thesetableswereconstructed by examining previ-ously discussed Lorenz curves at theappropriate quintiles. A comparisonof the two allows a quick assessmentof the changing fortunes of those atboth ends of the income spectrum.10090807060504030201000FIGURE 18.1AKentucky Income Distribution, 1980, 1990 1990 IncomeD-1980 Income 10203040506070Percent Kentucky HouseholdsSource: U.S. Bureau of the Census From Tables 18.1A and 18.1B, wesee that Kentucky's performance is worse that the nation's for the bottom quintile, as the share ofincome going to this quintile is less that the U.S. average for all the groups being studied.

Thefortunesofthebottomquintileremainedun-changed through the 1980s.These results apply to allthe household groups underconsideration. There is alsoevidence that the increase intheshare of income re-ceived by the top quintileover the decade in Kentuckyisgreater than the sameincrease for the nation's topquintile.WhilethetopquintileinKentuckyin-creased its share of income by 3 percent on average, the top quintile for U.S. households realized a 2 percent gain. Onceagain, this pattern is constant across demographic groups in the state.To provide the reader with a better sense of what income levels are required to be placed intothe different quintiles, Table 18.2 shows the approximate income received by U.S. and Kentuckyhouseholds at each of the quintiles. To be included into the fourth quintile (between the 60th and 80th percentiles) in Kentucky, for ex-ample, households would have had toreceive an annual income of $16,500in 1979 and an income of $29,000 in1989. For the United States, it mightbe useful to note that while it requiresa 1990 income of $97,000 to be placedon the 95th percentile, an income of$300,000 puts a household at the 97thpercentile. To make it to the 99th per-centile, households would have had to receive a little over $800,000.TABLE 18.21980 and 1990 Incomes at VariousU.S. and KY Household PercentilesPercentileU.S.Kentucky198019901980199020th$ 7,100$12,000$ 5,900$ 9,00040th$13,000$23,000$11,000$17,80050th$16,800$30,000$13,965$24,00060th$19,599$36,500$16,500$29,00080th$30,000$57,500$25,500$45,20095th$50,000$97,000$44,500$79,000Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census 193 Income Inequality in Kentucky 177 FIGURE 18.2Percent Growth of Household Incomeat Selected Percentiles15 10a453.63.1 KYFigure 18.2 compares decadegrowth rates in household incomesfor at the 20th, 40th,50th, 60th, 80th, and 95th per-centiles for the United States andKentucky. In this presentation, thedifferences between theUnitedStates and Kentucky are striking.While allthe U.S. householdsstudied witnessed growth in in-come, households on the 20th and40th percentiles in Kentucky be-camesignificantlypoorer.Ahousehold in the 20th percentile inKentucky, for example, witnesseda 10.7 percent fall in real income.Furthermore, income growth inKentucky lags behind that of thenation as a whole at every per-centile. That is, the Commonwealth became relatively poorer than the United States in real termsover the 1980s. It is important to recognize the uneven growth that took place in real incomesacross different percentiles. Those households placed on higher percentiles received significantlygreater gains to their incomes than did households below the 50th percentile. Post-World War IIincome growth in the United States has traditionally been distinguished by a pattern that resem-bles a staircase.4 The rich in Kentucky became richer, while the poor literally became poorer. Forthe United States however, both the rich and poor became richer, while the rich became relativelyricher.When combined with the results of Figure 18.2 and Table 18.1, the above discussion mightappear paradoxical. If the bottom two quintiles in the United States and Kentucky both lost in-come shares, how does one explain the 3.1 percent increase in real income accruing to a house-hold on the 20th percentile for the United States? The answer lies in the fact that over the decadeof the 1980s, the U.S. economy's gross domestic product grew almost 29 percent. While the sizeof the pie increased, the portions received by different groups (quintile shares) changed. For ex-ample, all households in the United States below the 40th percentile received 15 percent of thepie in 1980, but in 1990 they received only 13 percent. However, the increased size of the slice(for U.S. households) offset the loss in economic welfare from receiving a smaller share. PoorKentuckians however, found themselves receiving a smaller share of the pie, as well as a smallerslice; they were worse off in 1990 than they were in 1980. This disturbing finding represents anaberration in the otherwise healthy performance of the Kentucky economy. Further discussionand analysis of this finding will follow.Table 18.3 shows ratios of mean incomes for black- compared to white-headed households,and rural compared to urban housecreased over the 1980's. In 1980,on average, black households re-ceived 66 percent of what whitehouseholds received in the UnitedStates. In 1990, they received 64percent of the average white house-hold income. In Kentucky, the in-TABLE 18.3Relative Changes in Household IncomesUSKY1980199019801990Black/White Incomes Ratio .66.64.71.68RuraVUrban Incomes Ratio .90.86.85.83Source: U.S. Bureau of the Census Paul Krugman (1994) notes this finding for U.S. data in Peddling prosperity: Economic sense and nonsense in the age ofdiminishing expectations.New York, NY: W.W. Norton.194 178Exploring the Frontier of the Future come differential was even more pronounced. It was 71 percent in 1980 and fell by 3 percent to68 percent in 1990. Despite this adverse change, Kentucky still has a higher black/white incomeratio than the United States as a whole. -Changes in the rural/urban income differential tell a similar story: the disparity increased inthe previous decade for both Kentucky and the United States, with the Commonwealth's ruralhouseholds receiving 3 percent less that the nation's. In 1990, rural households in Kentucky re-ceived 83 percent of what urban households received; in 1980 the corresponding figure was 85percent. It is noteworthy, however, that while the rural/urban income ratio in Kentucky was moreunequal than the nation's in both 1980 and 1990, Kentucky's inequality increased by 2 percent,while the nation's increased by 4 percent.Interpreting the EvidenceIn the light of the preceding analysis, which establishes the increased inequality in the distri-bution of income, it is necessary to mention several caveats which will be useful in interpretingthe evidence and arriving at a conclusion. It is important to recognize that, for most householdgroups in Kentucky, real incomes rose regardless of declines in income shares. As Figure 18.3illustrates, Kentucky households above the median were better off in 1990 relative to 1980, de-spite the fact that both the 3rd and 4th quintiles lost income shares. The quality of life for ahousehold at the 70th percentile in 1990 might be equivalent to that enjoyed by a household atthe 75th percentile in 1980. For example, the median income for married couples in 1989 was$45,266 in 1989 dollars, and $24,800 in 1979 dollars. In 1979, they would have been placed atthe 74th percentile, and in 1989 at the 69th percentile. However, $24,800 in 1979 converts into$42,358 in 1989 dollars. In real terms, therefore, the welfare of this family has increased by 7percent over the decade, while their position on the distribution has worsened. This point is par-ticularly relevant to households which might have lost income share, but still realized gains inincome (for example, a household in Kentucky above the 50th percentile).While it is correct to interpret the increasing share of income received by the top quintile asevidence of the fact that the top quintile got richer, it is not correct to assume that the composi-tion of the top quintile remained unchanged over the 1980s. Income mobility in the United Statesis the highest in the world, and large increases in the incomes of the rich accompanied by smalldecreases in the incomes of the less privileged may not be intolerable, if we all spend time at bothends of the income distribution. In fact, research by Isabill Sawhill of the Urban Institute findsthat families who were in the top quintile in 1976 witnessed an 11 percent reduction in their realincomes by 1986. Despite Sawhill's research, it is difficult to believe that households in the toptwo quintiles in 1980 would find themselves in the bottom two 1990 quintiles.Trends toward smaller households may exaggerate changes in the income distribution. In-creasing family breakups or increases in the number of people living alone will contribute to theillusion of income inequality. A household made up of two wage earners each earning $30,000 ayear is treated as an upper middle class household earning $60,000. If that household breaks up,it is replaced with two households, each receiving $30,000 a year. In Kentucky, while populationgrew 0.7 percent between 1980 and 1990, the number of households grew by 9.5 percent. Theeffects of smaller households on the income shares of lower quintiles is not known. However,increasing divorce rates through the 1980s, as well as increases in the number of single-parenthouseholds and single-persdn households, have all contributed to a smaller average householdsize.Together, these caveats suggest that the popular case for increased income inequality beingdetrimental to the economy is overstated. Such analyses, which are typical in the sociology orpolitical science literature, typically ignore the idea that it is ultimately household or individualwelfare that ought to be the focus of analysis. Merely reporting a degeneration in the distribution195 Income Inequality in Kentucky 179 of income ignores a richer investigation that emphasizes changes in welfare and the dynamicnature of the U.S. economy.The preceding analysis has discussed changes in the distribution of U.S. income. In the fol-lowing section, evidence from the CPS on wage inequality in Kentucky is presented. The advan-tage of this inquiry is that we will be able to study changes in the distribution of earnings on anannual basis, an improvement over the two snapshots in time that Census data yield.Wage Inequality in KentuckyFigure 18.4 illustrates trends in the distribution of wage and salary earnings from 1993-1994.The horizontal axis is a simple time trend. The vertical axis measures average weekly earnings(in 1996 dollars) for workers at 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th and 90th percentiles of the wageand salary distribution. It is important to note that while the discussion on income inequality usedhouseholds as a unit of analysis, the CPS data uses individual workers as the unit of observation.One advantage of this approach is that it is not confounded by changes in the size and structureof households. Regardless of such changes, Figure 18.4 reports the wage and salary earnings ofindividual workers.FIGURE 18.3KY Distribution in the distribution ofwages. The differencesin wages are evident fromstudying differences in thelevels of weekly wages for agiven year. In each year, wenotice the skewed nature ofthe wage distribution;thedifferences in weekly wagesforthelowerpercentiles(10th, 25th and 50th) areless severe than the differ-ences for the upper percentiles. Also evident from the graph is the static nature of wage growthfor the lower percentiles, with higher but still moderate growth in the upper portion of the wagedistribution. This analysis allows us to conclude that while changes in the wage distribution maybe partially responsible for changes in the distribution of income over the same period, that rela-tionship is tenuous. Other sources of income such as property income or returns from capital in-vestments are also responsible for the deterioration in the distribution of income. Unfortunately,the nature of the CPS and Census data sets precludes a more detailed investigation of these hy-potheses.Some Possible ExplanationsSome of the losses to the lower income classes might be explained in terms of broader issuesfacing the U.S. economy. They permit us to compare changes in the complexion of the U.S. andKentucky labor force and. population over the 1980s.Kentucky's 20 percent decline in unionization rates could contribute significantly to part ofthe deterioration in the distribution of income. Unions typically compress the wage distribution asa result of their bargaining methods, and the decline in their membership in the 1980s, in part196 180Exploring the Frontier of the Future because of the downturn in mining, could have been particularly devastating to traditionally un-ionized blue-collar workers at the lower end of the distribution.A more plausible explanation is the steady increase in economy-wide returns to skill duringthe 1980s, as a result of technological progress. Such innovations reward those workers who usecomputers by enhancing their productivity. Typically, such labor has consisted of college-educated and other highly trained workers. Furthermore, increased U.S. participation in theglobal economy will reward highly educated labor and discriminate against unskilled labor whichis more abundant in the global economy. Studies of international trade have shown that theUnited States has a comparative disadvantage with regard to low-skill, labor-intensive produc-tion. While these studies are useful in explaining the declining income shares at the lower end ofthe distribution and increasing returns to the top quintile, they are not helpful in explaining theconstancy of income share received by the lowest quintile. Further research involving disaggre-gation by age and education is merited if these questions are to be more fully addressed.What is interesting about changes in the distribution of income for the decade of the 1980s isthat contrary to the relative equality surrounding income growth in the post-World War H era,the past decade saw incomes rising much faster at the top end of the distribution than at otherparts. Furthermore, households in the top quintiles saw their share of income rise 2 percent to 3percent, while those in the second, third and fourth witnessed a 1 percent fall in their incomeshare. The causes of increases in social problems over the decade among those with the lowestincomes cannot be attributed to a falling income share for the lowest income quintile. In fact, theincome share for this group remained constant at 3 percent during the 1980s. In the presence ofreal growth in incomes, mediocre changes in the distribution of income appear to be secondary. In fact, since much of the change in the distribution of income may be explained as a result ofincreasing returns to skill, as well as changing demographic composition, to enjoin a policy re-sponse would be premature given the limited understanding that we have of this problem.\"However, the fall in real incomes that poor Kentucky households received, as well as thesluggish 0.6 percent increase in real income at the median, call for immediate attention. Havingover 40 percent of the population significantly worse off in 1990 than in 1980 represents a singu-lar exception to the nation's growth record for the 1980s, and policymakers would do well to fo-cus attention on the Commonwealth's record in improving the economic welfare of its citizens.In the meantime, significant improvements in economic well-being will be realized only by thoseat the upper end of the income distribution, those for whom the grass grew during the 1980s. 197 Trends and Future Values in Technology This article identifies five technology product areas, or areas for applied scientific research, whichhave the most potential for innovation and expansion within Kentucky over the next 5 to 15 years. Theseareas are: telecommunications, life science technology, biotechnology, material design, and environmentalremediation. By Dick DedicUniversity of KentuckyFrom a global perspective the single most critical factor in the process of evaluating andforecasting the future of science and technology is compression of the time for discovery,creation, and commercialization of innovative technologies. Time has always been a criti-cal element in the evolution of technology and the way new ideas are fashioned into applied sci-ence. But today, and into the future, critical successes will hinge not only on the timing of anevent but also on the length of the time frame within which that event occurs. Not only will anidea have to occur at the time when it is most useful, it will occupy an increasingly shorter periodof ascendancy before being supplanted by newer and more advanced ideas. Consequently, fore-casting a future 5 to 15 years from now is like aiming at a moving target that changes directionand speed at will. At best, the forecaster will be right for only a small fraction of time.Nevertheless, the microprocessor is almost certain to be increasingly important, and the rateof scientific and technical discovery is likely to accelerate. Three new broad areas of developmentwill, in turn, affect every part of the evolution of science and technology. Firstly, the size of everyworking device will shrink. As machines continue to shrink at increasing rates, we will be able tomove more information, more quickly, across wider distances. Secondly, this nano-technologywill spawn a biogenetic revolution that will significantly affect the way in which humans exist bymore fully integrating living organisms with non-living support devices. Thirdly, we will developa highly sophisticated \"artificial intelligence\" that can be used in combination with human intel-ligence to escalate the development of the previous two processes. I point these concepts out notas an attempt to scare anyone with visions of a robotic future nor to put a \"wet blanket\" on thepotential for excellence, but rather to alert all of us to the potential of this magnificent adventurein self discovery. To succeed we must constantly evaluate where we are in the process and antici-pate high achievement rather than simply react to a realization that science and technology havechanged.In addition to global prospects, the process of technological innovation hinges on the presenceof pioneersfirms and individualsand a supportive local infrastructure. It is a two-way street.While innovative technology tends to issue from individual creators or champions within smalleconomic units, the overall infrastructure established by government encourages or discouragesinnovation. But nothing is certain. All too often, pioneering companies find a comfortable nicheand lose their pioneering spirit. What's more, the risk pioneers take does not always pay off, asthe work of seeking out and developing new technologies is costly and often subject to regulatoryrequirements designed to ensure product safety and efficacy. Moreover, products can be appro-priated in the marketplace by firms that have invested little time and effort. As a consequence,individuals and firms can only do so much. Likewise, infrastructure can only do so much to fa-cilitate success. Ultimately, we are able to achieve successful pockets of advanced technologywhen the individual or the enterprise risks becoming a technology pioneer and encounters a sup-portive infrastructure. Unfortunately, there is no precise formula that will ensure the successful 198 182Exploring the Frontier of the Future advancement of technology. Therefore, any prediction will remain hostage to the interaction ofthe individual and the facilitating infrastructure.In spite of the difficulty of creating the \"right\" infrastructure, I propose a series of specifictechnologies that are, at the very least, worthy of review and promotion at the state or regionallevel. I have concentrated on technologies for which global markets appear likely and a support-ing infrastructure already exists in Kentucky. It is my belief, however, that all institutions ofhigher education or individuals with a pioneering spirit should make earnest attempts to partici-pate in the research, development, and implementation levels of these technology areas. Further,the Commonwealth would do well to concentrate infrastructure-building efforts in these areas.Ultimately, scientific research within Kentucky's institutions of higher learning should becomemore attuned to the areas and to the potential for commercial application that they hold, an areathat needs more emphasis if Kentucky is to become competitive in new technologies.Increasingly, the federal government's approach to the discovery process is becoming limitedto providing a framework, while leaving discovery and development to industrial and academicsectors at the state and local levels. The largest applied research funding source within the fed-eral government, the Department of Defense, has been reducing its research and developmentbudget and retargeting its dwindling resources to support dual use technologies, those with civil-ian as well as military applications. Given this situation, more of the research burden will con-tinue to be shifted to the business and academic communities of states. Universities will be hardpressed to provide both basic and applied research capabilities without more active involvementfrom the business community and state government.In January 1996, the National Science Board released a study of Science and EngineeringIndicators, which examines all aspects of the research and development process from academicand industrial perspectives.' The United States, it concludes, is a world leader in science andtechnology, but that leadership has narrowed in relation to countries that have major commit-ments and capabilities and have increased their resources over the past two decades.2 This di-mension of global competition is significant for Kentucky because it opens new markets and newdevelopment opportunities for technologies derived from the rural, agricultural and extractiveindustries that have been the mainstays of the Kentucky economy for many years. Kentucky notonly shares geographic and industrial similarities with many technology-developing countries,but infrastructure similarities as well. Many of the new technological competitors on the globalscene have few major industrial centers and a limited breadth of technological expertise. Mostglobal competitors will be emerging from traditional industrial technologies to compete in limitedadvanced technology markets that can be supported by existing infrastructure and economic re-sources. The implication is, of course, that Kentucky should identify a set of technological priori-ties based on its existing capabilities, its historical experience and expertise, its realisticeconomic and academic resources, and its desire to become a technological pioneer.Future. Technologies I have selected five areas for technology products or applied scientific research which I be-lieve will be important to Kentucky during the next 5 to 15 years. The technologies I have se-lected are all included in the U.S. Bureau of Census classification system, 10 AdvancedTechnology Product Areas. Technologies included on this list have historically led to leading-edge or pioneering products. These product areas are derived from the National Critical Tech-nologies list of seven areas considered to be critical to develop and further long-term nationalsecurity or economic prosperity.3 This list of seven critical technologies is closely monitored both National Science Board. (1995). Science & engineering indicators-1996. (NSB 96-21). Washington, DC: U.S. GovernmentPrinting Office.2 National Science Board, p xvii.3 National Critical Technologies Review Group. (1995, March). National critical technologies report. Washington, DC:Government Printing Office.199 Trends and Future Values in Technology 183 in terms of imports and exports and in terms of academic research and development. The seventechnology areas pertain mostly to scientific research, hence are useful for international bench-marking of intellectual activity.The 10 Advanced Technology Product Areas are application-based derivatives of the criticaltechnologies list. As such, they are oriented toward the commerce of innovation. Patenting activ-ity has long been used as a marker of the direction of innovative development and scientificthinking. Each of the advanced technology product areas has experienced and continues to expe-rience high levels of patent activity both in the United States and abroad, further confirming thecategorization of these technologies as important to the global economy and the process of inno-vation. It is also important to recognize that these technology areas each represent very broadapplied capabilities and innovative possibilities. The 10 advanced technology product areas are:4Biotechnology. The medical and industrial application of advanced genetic researchto the creation of new drugs, hormones, and other therapeutic items for both agricul-tural and human uses.Life Science Technologies. Application of scientific advances (other than biological)to medical science. For example, medical technology advances such as nuclear reso-nance imaging, echo cardiography and novel chemistry, coupled with new production-,techniques for the manufacture of drugs, have led to new products that allow for con-trol or eradication of disease.Opto-electronics. Development of electronic products and components that involveemission or detection of light, including optical scanners, optical disc players, solarcells, photosensitive semiconductors, and laser printers.Computers and telecommunications. Development of products that process increasingvolumes of information in shorter periods of time, including facsimile machines, tele-phonic switching apparatus, radar apparatus, communications satellites, central proc-essing units, computers, and peripheral units such as disk drives, control units,modems and computer software.Electronics. Development of electronic components (except for opto-electronic com-ponents), including integrated circuits, multi-layer printed circuit boards, and surface-mounted components, such as capacitors and resistors, that result in improved per-formance and capacity and, in many cases, reduced size.Computer-integrated manufacturing. Development of products for industrial automa-tion, including robots, numerically controlled machine tools, and automated guidedvehicles that allow for greater flexibility in the manufacturing process and reducehuman intervention.Materials Design. Development of materials, including semiconductor materials, op-tical fiber cable and video discs, that enhance application of other advanced tech-nologies.Aerospace. Development of technologies, such as most new military and civil heli-copters, airplanes and spacecraft (with the exception of communication satellites),turbojet aircraft engines, flight simulators, and automatic pilots.Weapons. Development of technologies with military applications, including guidedmissiles, bombs, torpedoes, mines, missile and rocket launchers and some firearms.Nuclear Technology. Development of nuclear power production apparatus, includingnuclear reactors and parts, isotopic separation equipment, and fuel cartridges (nuclearmedical apparatus is included in life science rather than this category). National Science Board, 6. 200 184Exploring the Frontier of the Future Selecting those technology areas and sub-areas with particular relevance to Kentucky is arisky proposition based on personal opinion, knowledge and, in some cases, almost entirely ongut-feeling. In addition to popular readings and the Census Bureau's analyses of trends in tech-nological development, I have relied highly on the theory that a single event can have a signifi-cant impact on the innovation process. This, in effect, creates a filter by which technologies maybe singled out without the interference of other market factors. The filter which I have used toselect the emphasized technologies is based on my perception of the existing or developmentallypossible science, technology and industrial resources of Kentucky and on the academic excellenceor potential excellence of Kentucky educational resources. As I have indicated, it is probably notpossible for a totally accurate picture of future technology to be developed at least on a narrowgeographic level. An exhaustive study would require too much time, money and too many as-sumptions. In addition, it would be out-of-date before it could be completed. My suggestions ofspecific technologies are therefore merely suggestions of potential.One major area of concern is public perception of the role of scientific discoveries and thenew technologies within the economic and educational framework of Kentucky. Approximately40 percent of Americans surveyed express a high level of interest in science discoveries and theuse of new technologies. Individuals with more years of formal schooling and more courses inscience and mathematics express significantly higher interest, demonstrating the persistent effectof science and mathematics education throughout the adult years.5 Kentucky's relatively lowposition in terms of literacy and other educational measures is disturbing to any prediction oftechnological advancement. A citizenry that is uninterested in science and technology because ithas an inadequate education is unlikely to support an infrastructure to develop technology. Fur-ther, such citizens are unlikely to become employees of technology-based businesses, given theirlack of educational achievement.Unless rapid change is effected, this problem of today will translate into failure in the future.Significant steps are being taken to increase the technology and scientific sophistication of chil-dren in Kentucky's school systems today, in the hope of producing a workforce and a populationthat will benefit from tomorrow's technology. The struggle will be within the legislating bodiesof Kentucky, which will be challenged to act on faith that the selective development of infrastruc-ture improvements and processes for seeding technologies with growth potential in Kentucky willhelp cultivate islands of opportunity and growth that will ultimately result in the economic bet-terment of the Commonwealth.Infrastructure and potential are only two of the three significant factors in successful techno-logical innovation. The makeup of individuals and companies in the state, the ability to attractindividuals and companies, and the ability to instill in this group the desire to be a part of theadvance of technology is the third, and many would argue, most important factor. Having led ourtechnology horses to the water, we now have the task of making that water (future technologies)so attractive that they cannot resist the temptation to drink. All of the technologies I am about tosuggest are doable, within the constraints of funds, education and other resources available toKentucky, but the will to excel is the difference between success and failure in any of these areas.The five technology areas which I believe have the most potential for innovation and expan-sion in Kentucky are:Telecommunications. Specifically, we should focus on the technologies of networking andinfrastructure development. Information interchange is taking on increasingly diverse forms.Kentucky is already a leader in statewide communications systems. It now needs to expand com-munications capabilities for more broadband information transfer to all segments of its popula-tion. In terms of satellite communications, Kentucky has an experience base in distance learningand the application of sideband information transmission. Opportunities to develop these re-sources include the presentation of public education in a uniformly excellent manner to all stu-dents within the state. It is important to be willing to promote the virtual reality classroom and 5 National Science Board.201 Trends and Future Values in Technology 185 the teleported teacher. This process can become a partnership of public and private organizationsthat will continue to blur (for the better) the distinction between the schoolroom and on-the-jobindustrial training. The outcome is likely to be much-desired educational improvement.Likewise, networks for the evolution of commerce as cooperative and joint ventures betweenmany small and individually capable organizations should be an expressed goal. To accomplishit, Kentucky research institutions should be considering projects that will reduce the size oftransmission and control equipment, increase the speed of data transmission, and more fully in-tegrate the human-machine potential of our existing communications networks. Futuristic facto-ries will require machine-to-machine interfaces at an increasingly more complex level.Tremendous amounts of information will have to be transported from designing and prototypingmachines, to the actual manufacturing process, most of which will be possible without humanintervention but responsive to human control.For example, it will soon be possible for a machine design change to be made as a result ofthe detection of a part failure in the field. Failure information will be fed to a design machine andfrom there to a manufacturing machine which will create the modified part. Any or all of thesemachines may be located remotely from eachother. This entire process will take placewithout direct human intervention other thanto monitor and acknowledge the process.Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) is not justthe wave of the future. It is a here-and-nowtechnology that is ideally suited to innovativeKentucky businesses. By exploring and implementing EDI, many small and otherwise uncom-petitive Kentucky businesses can combine to create a virtual manufacturing entity capable oflarge-scale contracts and high-quality production.All forms of public communications media are moving toward integrated, electronically basedsystems. The imminent deployment of interactive cable television and the national developmentof the \"information superhighway\" should stimulate cooperation between Kentucky educationaland economic institutions. This will facilitate full information access for all individuals and busi-nesses in the Commonwealth. The phenomenal growth of the Internet for commercial purposeswill offer Kentucky businesses many great opportunities to capitalize on their individual expertiseas it applies to the international marketplace. Global commerce is now not so much a dream butan eminently doable process whereby Kentucky companies can forge links with other providersand consumers to deliver Kentucky-born expertise, goods, and services to a waiting world.The manufacture of communications tools by Kentucky companies will be limited to compo-nent assembly and packaging in the short term and may be stifled over the long term unlessspecific centers of academic and research excellence can be developed to support the innovationto commercialization process. At present, Kentucky industry does not have the potential forlarge-scale growth in the product development area of telecommunications. Historically, Ken-tucky's electronics industry has followed blueprints or designs of others (mostly from outside thestate). Evolution of the internal capacity to expand this sector will ultimately be based on the ca-pacity of academic and research institutions in the state.In contrast, significant potential exists for the manufacture of sub-components. The manufac-ture of switches, connectors, and transmission media that will be the backbone of tomorrow'stelecommunications industry is based on technology that is well within the current capabilities ofKentucky companies. The choice can be made to continue along the path of a job shop environ-ment or to pursue the more ambitious process of facilitating the commercialization of innovationsproduced by Kentucky academic and research institutions. Development of the latter capacity toits highest potential is within the ability of academic institutions and telecommunications-basedElectronic Data Interchange is not justthe wave of the future. It is a here-and-now technology that is ideally suited toinnovative Kentucky businesses. 202 186Exploring the Frontier of the Future companies in the state and a critical step if this industry segment is to become a viable part of the21st century economy.Life Science Technology. Nano-technology medical devices, which can be used as humanreplacement parts or as diagnostic and surgical repair robots, are likely to be a significant tech-nology force in the very near future. Coexistent with the development of these devices will be thetechnical implantation and remote control skills needed to implement their deployment. An ex-ample of this type of technology would be microscopic devices that \"cruise the bloodstreamsearching for fat deposits and infectious organisms\" they destroy.6 Kentucky has several centersof medical excellence and is strategically located within consultation/collaboration distance ofseveral more. Kentucky has demonstrated research and development capabilities in the micro-machine arena and in microsurgery. By encouraging networking and cooperation among themedical research community and the health sciences applications arena, new products in nano-technology diagnostic and surgical applications could be developed using existing resources.Such products would have worldwide marketability and enormous economic potential for Ken-tucky companies.Also included in this category are pharmaceutical products that can be delivered to the patientthrough a variety of media. Business Week reported that the drug distribution field saw earningsjump 459 percent from 1991 to 1992.7 With an already firm base in pharmaceutical research andpotential for large-scale human and animal testing, this technology should be encouraged andsupported by local and statewide initiatives. Existing infrastructures in pharmacology researchneed to be maintained and strengthened and additional encouragement given to pharmaceuticalmanufacturing companies to form or relocate in Kentucky to facilitate growth in this sector. Inaddition, the drug delivery research initiatives already underway need to be encouraged, as theywill become a significant new method of health care delivery.Biotechnology. Two areas of new development with potential involvement by Kentucky aca-demic and industrial institutions are Recombinant DNA techniques and Monoclonal antibodiesused in diagnostic testing. Recombinant DNA techniques (genetic engineering or \"gene splic-ing\") have spawned the most profitable success to date and are likely to continue to producebreakthrough drugs in the future.8 Particularly in the areas of agricultural feed development andcrop immunization, Kentucky has a significant investment in scientific and technical expertise.Capitalizing on engineered feeds for livestock, the biotechnology industry in Kentucky has thepotential to profoundly impact the market over the next 20 years. Given the worldwide need foreconomies in food production, Kentucky companies must recognize their potential to make amajor contribution to innovative, applied agricultural science.Monoclonal antibodies and DNA probes are biotechnology products used in medical diagnos-tic testing. Examples include a technique for imaging fibrin clots, an early indicator of heart dis-ease. More specially engineered substances that make entire new realms of testing possible willappear. As physician liability for malpractice increases, the demand for more accurate tests andmore testing continues to grow.9 Far and away the largest category of biotechnology patents is-sued by the U.S. Patent and Tradeniark Office in 1992 was drug, bio-affecting and body treatingcompositions. The potential for development and the process of administration of new pharma-ceuticals in conjunction with this biotechnological activity is clearly one of the best opportunitiesfor growth in Kentucky's technological future.Materials Design. Advanced materials is an extremely broad and active area of technologydevelopment. Development in this area has arisen from increased awareness of the need to con- 6 Petersen, J.L.

The products being created respond to needs for lighter, more corrosion resis-tant products that will be stronger in new environments. As we push the present limits of micro-technology toward the concepts of nano-technology, we will be increasingly concerned with thestructure and composition of the materials used to house products.While we anticipate tiny, self-contained computing/communicating devices that will be car-ried in our shirt pockets, those devices cannot become reality unless the package in which theyare housed can be made lighter, smaller, and stronger than present materials permit. Of the threemajor categories of composite materialsceramic matrix composites, polymer matrix compos-ites, and metal matrix compositesKentucky is already involved in the first category and variousindustries within the Commonwealthare researching or developing appli- Kentucky industry is capable of developingcations for the second. critical technical know-how, and the state'sOne of the major change agents research community is beginning toin the field of advanced materials is demonstrate more intense interest in the burgeoning automotive manufac- materials design. turing sector, which includes majorassembly plants and an extensive parts supply sector located throughout Kentlicky. As transpor-tation manufacturers seek to reduce weight, improve corrosion resistance and increase thestrength of their final product, they will exert an inexorable force on their suppliers to seek newfabricating materials. Potentially, the ceramic and polymer matrix technology sectors could be-come a significant economic factor in Kentucky manufacturing, as well as in the scientific econ-omy.While much of our technology is now imported from other states or other countries and sim-ply applied to existing industry, it is well known that Kentucky industry is capable of developingcritical technical know-how, and the state's research community is beginning to demonstratemore intense interest in this emerging field. New wood-forming technologies, for example, arebeing used to create valuable dimensional lumber from previously under-utilized Kentucky hard-woods. This represents a significant advancement in Kentucky's efforts to develop new materialsthat capitalize on natural resources in this state. This also represents a noteworthy advance in thetechnological orientation of the wood processing industry that could lead to important advancesin natural materials products that meet the same needs as manmade materials.Environmental Remediation. Although not a technology product area noted by the CensusBureau, no sector of emerging technologies holds as much promise for Kentucky as does thearena of environmental remediation. Each of the Advanced Technology Product Areas cites pol-lution prevention and, environmental remediation as an essential part of the manufacturing proc-ess. Environmental protection can be expected to be a required part of any new productdevelopment in the 21st century. In addition, worldwide industry has left a legacy of earlier in-dustrial pollution that begs for remediation. Both the state and companies within it have donemuch to exploit the abundant natural resources with which Kentucky was endowed. Unfortu-nately, there are many instances in which exploitation turned into abuse and neglect. In recentyears, state firms and state government have acted responsibly to recover and recycle resourcesand explored many opportunities for remediation. Four of the top 10 U.S. companies that filed forenvironmental remediation patents in 1992 had operational facilities in Kentucky.The United States generates 180 million tons of municipal solid waste annually and landfillsmore than 130 million tons of this material. By the year 2000, more than 54 million tons of wasteproducts will be without a suitable dump site. Waste paper and wood wastes are the single largestcomponent of municipal wastenearly half by weight. Bio-conversion of wood fibers will allow204 188Exploring the Frontier of the Future new uses for waste wood, mostly in building materials.\"I\u00b0 Rather than becoming a dumpingground for industrial and biological waste from other states, Kentucky can become a remediationand reprocessing center with economic potential coming from our positive location within thenational transportation grid and our abundance of other raw feed stocks to add to the materialsshipped in for recycling.The potential technologies for development in Kentucky include sulfur dioxide emission con-trol, oil waste water or acid mine drainage pollution remediation, and biodegradation of existingorganic hazards. Unfortunately, this entire area is one in which the scientific and technical issuesare more often than not victims of economic and political considerations. Funding for researchactivities that could lead to breakthrough advances in all areas of environmental remediationhave been highly publicized but minimally financed. Kentucky has begun many initiatives andstill has much to accomplish in this technological quarter, but the fact that we have begun andthat we are aware of the need places Kentucky industry and technology infrastructure ahead ofother states and most countries.Conclusion Time, change and rate of change will be the significant factors in shaping the future of Ken-tucky science and technology. The Information Revolution will provide the paradigm shift tostimulate this change. The infrastructure that will encourage and ultimately support the discov-ery, development and application of future Kentucky science and technology is now being putinto place. It requires improvement, innovation and additional support from all sectors of theeconomy.The obvious starting point is continuous improvement of the education system, particularly inthe areas of mathematics, and science. This needs to be followed by an emphasis on attracting andnurturing technology pioneers in Kentucky. Successful accomplishment of these first two stepswill strengthen Kentucky science and technology industries and prepare them to become com-petitive factors in the global economy of the 21st century. The third part of this forecast presentsthose specific technologies which I believe hold the greatest potential for development within theeconomic framework of the Commonwealth. The major and projected strengths of Kentucky sci-entific expertise and developable technologies lie in the fields of telecommunications, medicalproducts, biotechnology, advanced materials, and environmental remediation. While it is impos-sible to accurately predict specific success or failure in any one of these cited fields and equallyimpossible to rule out the advent of an entirely new area of advancement unrelated to the citedfields, it would appear likely to this observer that a concentration of economic and human effortin the fields noted offer an effective use of the limited developmental resources available over the next decade. I\u00b0. Dickinson, 39-40.205 Ready Or Not:Kentucky in the Global Economy This paper examines the globalization of the Kentucky economy. A summary of the international na-ture of the Kentucky economy illustrates how well Kentuckians are meeting the opportunities offered byglobalization and demonstrates how trade and investment liberalization are helping and/or hurting Ken-tucky residents. Trends in exports, imports and foreign direct investment are examined, as well as thepotential effects of globalization on income distribution and employment. By Chris SauerUniversity. of Michigan0ver the course of the 1990s, the United States has moved in unprecedented ways towardfull participation in the global economy. The growing importance of foreign trade andinvestment has been one of the most significant trends in recent U.S. economic history.The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is just one of a number of pacts that hasserved to illustrate the unprecedented consensus about the appropriateness of free trade that nowexists among most nations. Gone are the mercantilism and the arranged trade among politicalallies of the past. In the coming millennium, goods and services will sell freely throughout theworld.But policymakers, academics and citizens alike continue to debate the relative benefits asso-ciated with opening our economy further to world trade and investment. While many see un-limited opportunity and potential, others see the forces of economic ruin at work. Clearly, thedynamics of globalization are producing economic benefits for workers, communities and statessuch as Kentucky, even as they generate competition that some workers and firms cannotmatch. The challenge for states like our own is one of capturing a greater share of the benefitsof globalization while minimizing the negative consequences. To do so, it will be necessary tobetter prepare workers and firms to compete in a global arena while mediating adverse conse-quences.The Dynamics of Global Trade While the United States has always been an advocate of liberalizing trade around the world,an increased emphasis has been evident over the past 15 years. In response, the volume of U.S.trade has risen dramatically. Imports increased 247 percent between 1980 and 1994 while ex-ports increased 172 percent over the same time period. The United States has run a trade deficitover each of the years in this period, not as a result of the increased emphasis on globalization,but rather due to other macroeconomic phenomena. The real significance of these developmentslies in the fact that an increased emphasis on free trade has been accompanied by rising volumesof imports and exports, which produce jobs and income around the globe.Forces other than trade agreements are also giving rise to expanded global trade. Increasedspecialization of workers and gaps in productivity make some areas more conducive for the pro-duction of certain products and services. Fluctuations in exchange rates also make imports andexports more or less attractive to particular countries. As illustrated in Figure 20.1, year-to-yearchanges in merchandise trade demonstrate market responsiveness to varying currency exchangerates. Since 1985, changes in exports and imports has vacillated dramatically. As the strength of206 190Exploring the Frontier of the Future the dollarfell in the late 1980s, import growth slowed and eventually began to contract. Whilecurrency fluctuations should not affect magnitudes of trade over the long run, they help explainsome of the recent trends in world trade, particularly the large U.S. trade deficit with Mexico.National trade deficits, however, are the result of macroeconomic choices, and only structuralchanges in U.S. economic policy (such as increased national savings or a lower federal budgetdeficit) could abolish a trade deficit. 700600500zi 400-a\u00b0 3002001000-100-200FIGURE 20.1U.S. Merchandise Trade, 1980-1994 19791981198319851987198919911993Source: Economic Report of the President, 1996Theprospectforexportgrowth hasincreasedsignifi-cantly as a result of the NorthAmerican Free Trade Agreementand the General Agreement onTariffs and Trade.

Signed by 117countries, GATT promises to have the most pronounced impact on U.S. and Kentucky trade.NAFTA, the well-known agreement to create a free-trade zone between Canada, Mexico and theUnited States is also providing many new opportunities for exports.Many critics of free trade have been quick to point to the poor U.S. trade performance withMexico since the enactment of NAFTA to support their claims about the dangers of free trade.The U.S. trade position with Mexico deteriorated from a surplus of $1.4 billion in the first 11months of 1994 to a $14.4 billion deficit in the first 11 months of 1995.3 This deterioration does 6I5% \u00b0co0 /0a.-5%-10%-15%198030%25%20%15%10%FIGURE 20.2Percentage Change in MerchandiseTrade 1980-1994AiA,Exports_ImportsV the President, 19961994make the optimistic forecastsfor NAFTA seem misguided,but much of the decline inexports to Mexico can be ex-plained by the country's cur-rency instability.

So while U.S. exports had difficulty sell-ing to Mexicans suffering from a devalued peso, U.S. exports fared much better than they would As of January 1, 1995, the World Trade Organization replaced GATT.2 1995, Baldwin, et al.3 Economic Report of the President.

According to board chair Irwin Mistrock,business had fallen off 20 percent from the previous year, with over 40 percent of that businessmoving overseas. Mistrock said, \"NAFTA and GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade) have really hurt us.'\"Losing industries are not the only story, however. Kentucky businesses and farmers havebeen exporting products for decades, and changes in trade laws have provided new opportuni-ties, as well as new competitors. Companies like Maker's Mark are finding new markets as aresult of trade liberalization; its exports have grown between 20 percent and 30 percent everyyear of the 1990s. The company now exports 50,000 cases of bourbon a year, or one fifth of itstotal sales.' Last year alone, Toyota exported nearly 70,000 automobiles assembled at itsGeorgetown, Kentucky, plant.

According to a 1995report by the Kentucky World Trade Center, the state's rate of export growth has exceeded theU.S. export growth rate since 1989.\" The authors of the report also note that Kentucky's export-ing sector has become an increasingly important portion of the Commonwealth's economy. Us-ing aggregate personal income as a measure of overall economic activity, the report finds exportgrowth of 12.7 percent from 1989 to 1994, compared to overall economic growth of 6.1 percent.But globalization will continue to demand more of all enterprises, as well as public infra-structure, in return for access to its enormous potential. While GATT and NAFTA have in-creased prospects for doing business abroad, they have also increased the number of competitorsin each market. New industry standards, like those contained in the ISO 9000 accords, requireexporting companies to be well versed in quality standards and to manufacture products accord-ingly. Small businesses, the businesses most prevalent in Kentucky, face particular difficultymeeting these demanding standards. A 1995 report by the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Re-search Center, Factories, Farms and Free Trade, found that many rural Kentucky firms areeither inadequately prepared for or uninterested in the potential benefits of free trade.One industry that faces the possibility of further decline as a result of GATT and NAFTA isthe apparel industry. Some well-publicized plant closings in Kentucky in recent months andyears have broadened awareness of this problem. Low-wage, low-skill industries, like apparel,are most susceptible to competition from the developing world where wages and working con-ditions are often substandard. As Schirmer and Taylor note, apparel's future in the Common-wealth is uncertain in the age of globalization. Nonetheless, certain strengths of Kentucky'sapparel industry, namely its relative growth in the late 1980s and its larger than average plantsize, offer hope for its future viability.Overall, export prospects are brightened by trade liberalization. While a U.S. trade deficitmay persist, Kentucky businesses still need to seize the opportunities made available by globali-zation. New markets offer chances to increase production, profits, and employment. We shouldbe looking for opportunities to export, since jobs supported by goods exports pay 13 percentmore than the national average.\" But the aggressive pursuit of new sales should not be accom-panied by a neglect of opportunities nearer to home. The greatest benefits of free trade will berealized when companies work to take fullest advantage of opportunities both here and abroad.State and local policymakers should assist businesses interested in exporting by developingand expanding the state's supportive infrastructure. Businesses, small businesses in particular,with the potential to develop export sales often do not have the resources needed to pursue theseopportunities. The state could provide technical assistance to businesses looking to expand theirsales beyond U.S. shores. Often, these businesses need guidance about the standards for export(such as the aforementioned ISO 9000), procedures, and institutions governing trade. Offices inforeign countries, such as the state's presence in Japan and Mexico, also offer Kentucky busi-nesses a valuable aid in moving into these markets. Expansion of these efforts should be consid-ered. Exporting businesses also need access to quality systems of transportation and affordableenergy resources. State and local governments, if they wish to increase the business commu-nity's foreign trade, must not lose focus of the importance of needs in this area.There is no reason to believe that the current trend of export growth will not persist. Theemergence of economic affluence in certain developing nations will create millions of new con-sumers for U.S. products. The strengthening economies of Europe and Japan also should con- 10 In \"FAIR is foul for farmers and consumers,\" Larry Swartz and Katherine Ozer depict the Farm Bill of 1996 as a boon tocorporate agricultural interests at the expense of the family fanner.

According to President Clinton's \"National Export Strategy,\"GATT and NAFTA should help increase U.S. exports from $660 billion in 1993 to over $1 tril-lion by the year 2000, supporting over six million new jobs.\" Kentucky businesses can capturesome of these increases if they are willing to search for opportunities and if they are assisted bythoughtful government policies and programs.Foreign Direct Investment in Kentucky FIGURE 20.3Manufacturing Employment of Affiliates InKentucky, By Country of UBO\u00b0Latin AmericaSwitzerlandNetherlandsRest of AsiaRest of EuropeFranceCanadaU.K.GermanyJapan05101520Emp loymant (In thousands)UBO is Ultimate Beneficial Owner.Source: US Department of Commerce, 1995.Obviously, investments like the Toyota plantforeign direct investment (FDI): a foreign firm builds a facility and begins to produce in theUnited States. Another obvious impact is the jobs that investments like the Toyota factory createfor Kentucky workers. But this type of investmentrepresents only a portion of the total FDI'5 picture.One of the most noticeable changesin the Kentucky economy as a result ofglobalization is the increased presenceof foreign firms and factories. Encour-aged by relatively low-wage rates and aweak dollar, foreign firms have found itadvantageous to move operations to theUnited States. Kentucky has been thebeneficiary of a number of these deci-sions. While the Toyota plant and itssuppliersattractthe most attention,firms in a range of industries from di-verse countries have chosen to openoperations in Kentucky. In 1992, theU.S. Department of Commerce reportedthat foreign firms employed more than70,000 Kentuckians .14represent the most visible manifestation of Where are foreign investors putting their dollarsin Kentucky?Considering that manufacturing ac-counts for over a quarter of Kentucky's gross stateproduct, by far the largest of any sector, it is not sur-prising that it accounts for a large portion of FDI inKentucky. The Bureau of Economic Analysis reportsthat 71 percent of the gross property, plant andequipment of foreign affiliates in Kentucky are theinvestments of companies classified as manufactur-ing entities.FIGURE 20.4Property, Plant & Equipment ofAffiliates in Kentucky 12 ManufacturingCI All Other Industries Source: U.S. Dept. of Commerce 13 Baldwin, et al. National export strategy.14 The Department of Commerce describes a U.S. affiliate as foreign when over 10 percent of the company is controlled by acompany outside the United States.15 Foreign direct investment (FDI) describes the earnings retained by U.S. established subsidiaries or branches of foreigncompanies as well as the transfer of funds from the parent firms to their subsidiaries. It does not include portfolio investmentby foreigners, when they chose to buy stocks, bonds, or other private and government -held securities. Furthermore, it does notaccount for funds borrowed within the United States by foreigners to invest in their U.S. subsidiaries or branches. It doesinclude the purchase of existing companies and real estate. (Ondrich and Wasylenko, 1990). So calling FDI investment issomewhat misleading. By including real estate and existing company transfers, it terms a great deal of what are in reality assettransfers as investments. In reality, FDI measures the flow of financial assets.21.0 194Exploring the Frontier of the Future Which countries areinvesting in Kentucky?Unlike in most states,the Japanese are by farthe greatest foreign in-vestors in the Kentuckyeconomy.Overall,theBritish invest the mostinto the U.S. economy.PerhapsJapanesestrength in manufactur-ing attracts them to theCommonwealth. As Fig-ure 20.5 shows, a widearray of investors frommanycountrieshaveholdings in Kentucky.Why are the inves-torschoosingKen -.tucky?Location andlow wage rates play acentral part in some de-cisions to locate new facilities. Certainly, incentive programs offered by state and local govern-ments are a factor, but no clear consensus exists on the role of tax inducements and other fac-tors. According to Ondrich and Wasylenko, \"Higher in general, right-to-work laws,and unionization of the workforce ... are generally not found to have a statistically significanteffect on FDI in states.'\"6 Because an amalgamation of factors usually leads to the decision toinvest in a particular area, it is difficult to isolate factors that account for the extent of FDI inKentucky.Lain of Kentucky's future? Many experts anticipate a new wave of FDI on the ho-rizon. But Kentuckians cannot wait for FDI to come to us. If we wish to reap its benefits, wemust work to make Kentucky an attractive place for investment in new and expanding enter-prises. Howard Gray, whose Lexington construction company has built more than 140 Japanesefactories in the United States, told an Owensboro audience interested in attracting Japanese in-vestment to Daviess County: \"It must be an all-out effort. You must invest time and money inlearning their culture ... You can't wait for the customer to come to you.\"\"Gradually, Kentucky is becoming a player in the global economy, as foreign trade and in-vestment comprise more and more of the state economy. Most economists agree that the resul-tant development is an efficient outcome, one that can be expected to maximize social welfare. 16Ondrich,J., Wasylenko, M. (1993).

B4.2.11 Ready or Not: Kentucky in the Global Economy 195The Effects of GlobalizationIncome Distribution. Many critics of free trade have bemoaned its potentially deleteriouseffects on worker's wages. The proverbial \"giant sucking sound\" symbolizes the migration oflow-skill jobs across borders and the resulting drop in U.S. employment. In turn, it is argued,incomes are become increasingly stratified, creating inequities and, over the long term, the po-tential for social upheaval. Without doubt, income stratification has worsened in the UnitedStates, particularly since the early 1980s.\" This trend, however, is probably not the result of anysingle factor but more likely a combination of several circumstances. Whether greater opennessto trade is a cause any of income stratification is more difficult to determine.Harvard economist Robert Lawrence concludes that trade has played only a small role in thestagnation of industry wages.' Instead, Lawrence's analysis places the blame for poor wagegrowth on the accompanying slow growth in productivity. Lawrence believes that the effects oftrade are most likely to be seen on relative industry wages. The Brookings Institution's GaryBurtless agrees that many factors are at work. While Burtless observes that liberal trade mostdefinitely is part of picture of worsening job prospects for America's unskilled workers, he con-cludes that international trade \"has not been the decisive factor in the trend toward greaterearnings inequality.\"20On the other hand, Lester Thurow argues that trade has and will continue to bring down realwages in the United States.' Believing the Federal Reserve too eager to curb inflation, Thurowargues that trade can only lower wages when coinciding with an overabundance of labor. Ac-cording to Thurow, if the forces of factor price equalization resulting from globalization con-tinue to operate in a world of slack labor markets in the United States, the rate of decline in realwages will only accelerate.Economist Thomas Palley also points to globalization as one of the factors suppressingwages in the United States. While acknowledging the benefits of free trade between similarpartners, Palley decries open trade based solely on wage differentials. This type of trade, whichPalley categorizes as typical between the United States and the developing world, promotes a\"race to the bottom\" that \"lowers wages, job security, and social-welfare standards.\"\"While the extent to which globalization has affected U.S. wages remains uncertain, it doesappear plausible that free trade agreements have exerted downward pressure on compensation.Workers in low-skill, low-wage jobs are particularly vulnerable. Kentucky's manufacturingbase, particularly in its rural areas, contains many jobs in this category. These workers, whoface stagnating wages or potential unemployment, could ultimately be the big losers as globali-zation and the effects of free trade expand.Employment. What do the employees at the Toyota plant in Georgetown have in commonwith the workers of the OshKosh B'Gosh plant in Marrowbone? Very little. The former groupcan claim that their high-skill, high-wage jobs are the result of globalization. The latter groupcan claim that their former jobs moved off shore because of that same trade and investment lib-eralization.\" As is typical of a free marketplace, the competition that globalization generatesproduces winners and losers, but high skills are clearly an edge for firms and workers.After growing for all but one of the past 12 years, employment in Kentucky's apparel facto-ries dropped in 1994. Whether this is an aberration or a new trend is unclear. Manufacturingemployment did grow overall between 1993 and 1994 by nearly 10,000 jobs, but workers in in- 18 See A.

A5.212 196Exploring the Frontier of the Future dustries like apparel were not fortunate enough to be part of the growth.\" It is also unclearwhether certain areas were affected by the changing employment conditions more than others.At this stage in the process, it is impossible to account for the employment effects of globali-zation with any certainty. Some new employment opportunities will arise as other jobs aretransferred to other regions or countries. Generally, globalization should provide jobs in areas ofrelative strength in skill and productivity while eliminating jobs where no competitive advan-tage exists. The growth of employment in relatively high-skill jobs suggests that we redoubleour efforts to train workers, particularly those low-skill workers who are most vulnerable to thepossibility of job losses.What does FDI mean for Kentucky's residents? Mirroring the debate over the positivesand negatives of free trade, the debate over the value of FDI has been heated and divisive. Pro-ponents argue that FDI increases productivity, supplements employment, and offers better pricesto consumers. Critics believe that FDI only provides lower paying jobs and reduces the homecountry's international investment position. Both arguments have some validity.FDI does appear to increase productivity. Carnegie-Mellon Professor Richard Florida con-cludes that FDI is key to improving U.S. productivity. He argues that FDI, much more thantrade, has led to productivity growth by moving technology from more advanced countries toother countries that have not been as organizationally or technologically innovative.\" This, inturn, places pressure on domestic producers, who must improve their productivity to competewith the transplants. Florida observes that the migration of management practices often coin-cides with FDI. For example, he cites Toyota's \"just-in-time\" inventory and parts procurementsystems. By keeping inventories small and maintaining the flexibility to purchase parts asneeded, the factory minimizes complicated inventory management and storage while maximiz-ing its capacity to react to changing needs in production. Florida also notes the ways in whichToyota's suppliers have adapted to these demands, increasing productivity and spreading theknowledge to yet another sphere of supplier facilities.If FDI increases productivity, how does it affect wages? Economic theory posits that wagesare a function of worker productivity. Wages should, therefore, be expected to rise as productiv-ity rises. It does appear that workers in foreign affiliates in the United States are paid more thantheir counterparts who perform similar duties for U.S.-owned firms in this country. Research byNed Howenstine and Dale Shannon shows that affiliates whose ultimate owner beneficiaries livein one of the six countries that invest the most in the United States pay their workers more forsimilar tasks than U.S.-owned companies.\"Critics of FDI argue that foreign firms only use relatively unskilled labor in their U.S. op-erations, choosing to keep the more lucrative, skill-based positions at home. This is particularlybelieved to be the case in research and development positions. Edward Graham and Paul Krug-man analyze compensation and value added per employee for U.S. affiliates of foreign firms aswell as for U.S. firms, however, and they note that no systematic differences exist between for-eign and domestic firms in compensation or value added, particularly in manufacturing. Theyconclude, the \"data.. . do not provide any support for the view that foreign firms typically keepthe good jobs or the high-value-added activities at home.\"27 Graham and Krugman argue that noevidence can support the claim that U.S. affiliates of foreign companies offer worse jobs thantheir U.S. counterparts. 24 Schirmer, P., Taylor, M.

Foreign direct investment in the United States. Washington', DC: Institute for International Economics.213 Ready or Not: Kentucky in the Global Economy 197 Almost everyone seems to agree that FDI increases employment, although the relationship isnot as obvious as it would appear. A more thorough examination shows that FDI probably doesnot influence the aggregate amount of employment in the United States as much as it helps de-termine the physical allocation of jobs among regions or states. Graham and Krugman reportthat FDI has probably had very little effect on levels of employment in the United States. Theyargue that since levels of employment are determined by supply and not demand, FDI couldhave noticeable effects on employment only over the very short run. In fact, they observe, \"Thenet impact of FDI on U.S. employment is approximately zero.\"\" While their observations areprobably correct, FDI can cause jobs to migrate from one region or state to another, from high-wage areas to relatively low- wage-Kentucky, for example. Julius concludes that plant locationsresulting from FDI can boost employment, particularly in high-unemployment areas. Echoingthe sentiments of Graham and Krugman, Julius argues that many of the employment gainstouted by proponents of FDI are jobs created at the cost of other jobs. Workers move from plantto plant, but unless there is rampant regional unemployment, total employment cannot be no-ticeably increased by FDI.Relatively little research has addressed the effects of FDI on the distribution of income. Aneconometric study by Frank and Freeman\" looked at the distributional effects of FDI and foundthat capital inflows clearly benefit U.S. workers while lowering the income of U.S. owners ofcapital. FDI appears to benefit workers at the expense of existing domestic companies who faceintensified competition. The employees of the domestic firms, however, could lose if fresh com-petition from U.S. affiliates of foreign companies causes domestic firms to downsize or close.Workers employable in an industry likely to be the beneficiary of investment from foreignsources are better off with large amounts of FDI in these industries.Broadly, FDI has produced positive outcomes for Kentucky. Foreign firms provide covetedhigh-wage jobs that are preferable to many of the jobs lost as a result of FDI. Moreover, workersare being trained by these foreign affiliates and developing skill levels that are likely to be moretransferable. FDI also positively influences worker and firm productivity in Kentucky, both bytraining workers in high-skilled tasks and work systems and by offering Kentucky businessesinnovative examples of management techniques. Thus, the positives of FDI appear to outweighthe negatives. We should do our best to attract more FDI to the Commonwealth.Externalities: What are the more subtle effects of globalization? While most of the effectsof globalization are fairly obvious, some of the effects are more subtle and less direct in nature.For example, Kentucky affiliates of foreign companies spend resources to train their workers.The presence of these companies, while providing the obvious benefit of employment, also addsto our human capital, endowing workers with, more refined skills that are in demand in themarketplace. Just as some workers are disheartened by the failure of their companies to competesuccessfully, others are becoming valuable members of internationally competitive enterprises.These externalities are small relative to the more obvious and direct effects, but they help de-velop the capacity of our labor force and the enterprises in our economy.ConclusionKentucky is already a strong participant in the global economy. International investors haverecognized the value that Kentucky offers as a base for manufacturing. And we are beginning totrade more of our products in global markets. While globalization hurts some of our residentsand helps others, we are no longer in a position to debate its propriety. National trade policy 28 Graham, E.M., Krugman, P.R. (1990).

New York: AcademicPress.214 198Exploring the Frontier of the Future dictates to us that we will compete in a global economy. To fail to take up this challenge willonly ensure that relative p9verty will continue to define us. Thus, we should take steps at thestate level to help those most hurt by globalization. Most importantly, we should continue tofocus on worker education and training that will permit low-skill, low-wage workers to competein high-skill, high-wage industries. At the same time, we need to carefully monitor the condi-tions of our family farms in an effort to prevent the purported benefits of free trade from erodingthe viability of a valued and traditional way of living. Free trade can benefit small farmers, onlyif they are given the same opportunities as those open to large, corporate farmers. Globalizationgrants us new opportunities and challenges. People around the nation and around the world areprepared to meet those same challenges and to take advantage of our opportunities if we are notready to do so ourselves. Like it or not, we must prepare or be left behind.ResourcesJulius, D. (1990). Global companies and public policy: the growing challenge of foreign direct invest-ment.

Washington, DC:Author. 4'131 Agricultural Exports:Opportunities for Kentucky's Farmers U.S. agricultural exports reached an all-time record high in 1995. Exports in essentially all catego-ries were up substantially from the previous year. The most significant growth in agricultural exports hascome in high-valued agricultural products and highly processed food products. The trend toward higher-valued U.S. agricultural exports is expected to continue as trade liberalization increases throughout theworld. In many regards, Kentucky is well positioned to benefit from the increased trade when it comes toraw and semi-processed agricultural products. However, if Kentucky's agricultural producers are tobenefit more from the increasingly global food market, they must take better advantage of increased tradeopportunities in other processed food products By Michael ReedUniversity of KentuckyAgriculture is a major enterprise not only for the United States, but also for Kentucky.Farm-level production of agricultural products may only account for 1.1 percent ofGross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1992, but if farm input suppliers, food processingcompanies, and other firms associated with agriculture are included, then agriculture accountsfor 15.7 percent of GDP.Agriculture involves much more than simply farm level production. It includes farm inputsuppliers and service providers, transportation firms, agricultural lenders, and food processors.The latter group is extremely important for the present paper because the United States is in-creasingly exporting food in more processed forms. The importance of these firms will onlyincrease in the future as people from all countries become more reliant on the food marketingsystem to provide convenience foods.U.S. agriculture is highly diversified, with large volumes of grain, livestock, dairy, fruits,vegetables, and other crops produced, and the United States is an exporter of most of these agri-cultural products. Kentucky agriculture is more concentrated in certain commodities, particu-larly tobacco, grains and livestock, and trends in U.S. exports reflect Kentucky exports. Tobaccois the most important crop in Kentucky, with production varying from 350 to over 500 millionpounds annually. Other crop production is more stable on an acreage basis, including corn(usually encompassing about 1.2 million acres), soybeans (at about 1.2 million acres), andwheat (at about 0.4 million acres). Recent changes in farm policy, specifically the Freedom toFarm Act, may markedly change future acreage decisions for these other crops in Kentucky.Livestock enterprises in Kentucky are changing much more rapidly than the crop enterprises.Broiler production in Kentucky has increased rapidly since 1991 (from $24.9 million in1991 to $71.2 million in 1994). With the state's new chicken production and slaughter facili-ties, those both recently built and announced; this high rate of growth will continue in the nextfew years. Beef is the largest livestock industry in the state and the state's beef herd (in 1994,the herd was 2.65 million head) has been expanding since 1990. However, the pork industry hasbeen in a clear downward trend since 1988, with only 800 thousand head in the state in 1994.The Kentucky food processing industry is more difficult to characterize because data fromthe Census of Manufacturers comes out only every five years. The most recent data are for 1987,though the 1992 figures will soon be released. In 1987, Kentucky food processing was domi-nated by beverage, meat, and dairy processing (value-added in these enterprises were $714 mil-lion, $178 million, and $140 million, respectively). Kentucky processing of fruits, vegetables,216 200Exploring the Frontier of the Future and other food products was small relative to these other industries. Obviously, the beverageindustry is dominated by distilled spirits.Aggregate U.S. export data must be used to investigate how Kentucky has been and will beimpacted by changes in agricultural and food exports. There is no way to document actual ex-port flows from Kentucky firms to overseas locations (especially since some products changeownership multiple times before they are ultimately exported). Nonetheless, U.S. exports of foodproducts positively impact Kentucky producers, so understanding future U.S. export patterns forcommodities produced in Kentucky will provide information on market developments for Ken-tucky producers too.History of U.S. AgriculturalExportsU.S. agricultural exports set an all-time record high in 1995, totaling $55.8billion,an increase of $10.1billionabove 1994 exports. Before 1994, theprevious record high was in 1981, whenU.S. agricultural exports totaled $43.3billion.Because saturatedU.S.foodmarkets are unable to absorb supply in-creases without significant price reduc-tions,thereisnoquestionthatinternational markets are the key to any future increases in demandHowever, this has been the case for a number of years.During 1981, U.S. agricultural exports were dominated by bulk commodity exports-thoseexports whose value is less than $400 per metric ton (such as corn, wheat, soybeans and rice).At that time, bulk agricultural products accounted for 61 percent of U.S. agricultural exports.Since 1986, there has been a clear trend away from exporting bulk products (Figure 21.1),though 1995 was an aberration where bulk commodity exports soared. As will be discussedlater, increased incomes abroad and trade liberalization have given U.S. food processors oppor-tunities to export more consumer-oriented products.$35.0$30.0$25.0$20.0$15.0$10.0$5.0$0.0FIGURE 21.1U.S. Agricultural Exports by Stage ofProcessingBulkProducts IntermediateProducts CI Consumer-OrientedProducts1981 1986 1991 1995Source: Foreign Agricultural Service.

U.S. ex-ports of wheat (and itsproducts),feedgrains(andtheirproducts),animals,andtobaccohave either fluctuated ordecreased between 1990and1994.Therearemore countries that canexport such products, soU.S. exports find it dif-ficult to compete with other export suppliers. Exports of meat, poultry, fruits (and their prepa-rations), vegetables (and their preparations), and oilseeds have grown persistently during the2' 17, Agricultural Exports: Opportunities for Kentucky's Farmers ,201 period. These latter products have more added value associated with them and are generallyexported in a more processed form. U.S. food processors have been able to supply these productsto foreign markets at competitive prices. This move toward U.S. exports of higher-valued, moreprocessed products will continue in the future as long as American food products can meet thecompetition internationally because of lower tariffs on processed foods and the move towardconvenience foods in other countries.East Asian and North American countries are the leading countries of destination for theseagricultural exports (Table 21.2), not European markets. Japan dominates other countries as adestinationforU.S.exports, alone account-ing for 20 percent ofU.S. exports, but Can-ada is also important.Canadian importsofU.S. food before theCanada-U.S.FreeTrade Agreement weremuch smaller, so tradeliberalizationhasgreatly benefited U.S.agriculturalexports.Income growth and trade liberalization in Mexico (associated with the North America FreeTrade Agreement, NAFTA) will have even larger beneficial effects on U.S. agricultural exportsbecause of agricultural production constraints in Mexico. Nonetheless, Mexico is still the thirdleading destination for U.S. agricultural exports.Fortunately, many Kentucky food processing firms happen to be in sub-industries that areexperiencing rapid export growth. Figure 21.2 shows U.S. exports of selected food productswhich are representative of Kentucky food processors. Since 1990, exports have grown by 22percent in the meat packing industry, 128 percent in the poultry industry, and 43 percent in thedistilled spirits industry. Each of these industries have increased more rapidly than the 18 per-cent overall increase in processed food exports. Kentucky firms are benefiting through expanded-Markets and higher prices for their output.Another factor, in addition to international trade, which is becoming increasingly importantin the globalization of the U.S. food processing industry is the growth in foreign direct invest-ment. Foreign direct investment occurs when a foreign company takes an equity interest in afirm operating outside its border. For example, when a U.S. food processor owns a facility (anaffiliate) in Belgium, that facility's operation could have important ramifications on U.S. foodexports. In 1993, sales from foreign operations of American food firms totaled $95.8 billion, over three times theTABLE 21.2U.S. Agricultural Exports U.S. Department of Agriculture $6$5$4$3$2$1$0FIGURE 21.2U.S. Exports of Selected Processed Foods, 1990-1994 19901991199219931994Source: Economic Research Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture0 Meat Packing Poultry ['Distilled andBlended Spirits0 Sausage in 1993again, much more thanU.S.processedfoodexports.Itiswell knownthatmultinational 202Exploring the Frontier of the Future firms initially use exports as an entry strategy and if they are successful, they will often invest inprocessing facilities at a later date. Most of the foreign facilities owned by U.S. food firms are inEurope (accounting for 57 percent of sales in 1993) and those facilities sell most of their outputin the country where their plant is located. The same is true for foreign-owned food processingfirms in the United States, the vast majority of their output is sold here. Thus, foreign directinvestment in food processing is an entry strategy to a market rather than a stage for exports toother countries, meaning that foreign production by U.S. food processors will hurt U.S. exports.It is important to note that most firms which invest in overseas processing facilities are hugefirms, and few Kentucky firms have processing facilities abroad. Yet, when Kentucky foodprocessing firms decide to enter the export market, they will find themselves competing with thesame firms they face here. The only difference will be that some of those competitors will haveprocessing facilities within the country whereas the Kentucky firm may not.Factors Driving Exports and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)One of the basic factors behind growth in U.S. agricultural exports is trade liberalization.Trade liberalization (reductions in tariffs, quotas, and other hindrances to trade) gives U.S. ag-ricultural producers more access to markets and allows them to compete on an equal basis withdomestic producers. Obviously, given the consistent volume of agricultural exports and recentsharp increases, U.S. agricultural producers have been successful in entering foreign markets.NAFTA and the recent GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) agreement are impor-tant to continue expanding demand for U.S. food products overseas. Yet most of their impactsare not seen in recent trade figures. The GATT agreement was only recently signed, and theexport growth to Mexico has slowed due to problems with the peso devaluation. However, theseagreements will have important trade enhancing effects for U.S. agriculture in the future.Despite all the trade liberalization that has taken place since the 1970s, income growthabroad is likely a more important reason for U.S. agricultural export and FDI growth. As seenin Figure 21.1, the growth in U.S. agricultural exports since 1981 has been concentrated in in-termediate and processed food productsproducts with higher value addedrather than in bulkcommodity exports. Further, the rapid growth in FDI by U.S. multinational food firms indicatesthat processed food markets are becoming increasingly important to U.S. food firms. Consumersthroughout the world now have enough income to purchase higher valued food items. As thiseconomic growth persists, these higher incomes will continue to play an important role in futureU.S. food exports and outbound FDI.Exchange rates have also played an important role in increasing U.S. agricultural exportssince the fixed exchange rate regime was eliminated in the early 1970s. As the value of thedollar falls, U.S. agricultural exports become cheaper for foreign customers. In 1981, a $3bushel of corn cost Japanese importers 660 yen, whereas the same $3 bushel of corn costs themonly 360 today. The U.S. dollar has depreciated against most major currencies since 1985, pro-viding a strong impetus for exports of price-sensitive agricultural products, such as grains andoilseeds.What the Future HoldsThe future for U.S. agricultural exports should be bright, with increases coming in mostproduct categories. Yet there are some overriding trends that, while prominent in recent years,will become more important in the future. Most importantly, world markets for food will likelybecome less sensitive to price over time, but more sensitive to product differentiation. Consum-ers will demand products with particular attributes that meet their consumption needs. If U.S.(and Kentucky) agricultural producers and food processors can recognize those desired charac-teristics and incorporate them into their outputs, they will be more successful. 2 1 q Agricultural Exports: Opportunities for Kentucky's Farmers 203 Many of these product characteristics will involve scientific developments that will improveproduct qualitymaking products safer, fresher, or more visually appealing. The scientificcommunity will .need to work closely with farmers and food processors to make sure that suchtechnology is developed and rapidly adapted into foods. This will give our producers and proc-essors advantages in the increasingly global competition.Another important element in future competitiveness, especially for Kentucky, is that infor-mation must flow to producers so that they can produce the desired products and deliver them tolucrative markets.. This is particularly important for Kentucky because farmers and processorstend to besmaller,than their competitors throughout the United States. and they do not havegreat ,access to' information on international markets. Thus, these Kentucky firms will havemore obstacles to overcome than many of their competitors. However, given the increasing de-mand for product heterogeneity throughout the world, there will be increased opportunities forexportation by these smaller, more specialized firms.Kentucky is well poised in two industries (distilled spirits and poultry processing) interna-tionally, but will not likely become a large exporter in other areas, such as red meat packing anddairy. There may be potential for developing other food processors, but the state's producers areunlikely to be able to compete in fruits, vegetables, and other products on a large scale. The to-bacco export market has much more growth potential than the domestic market. Yet the futurefor tobacco exports is very much dependent on smoking and health issues in foreign countries,the magnitude of price support changes, and trade liberalization in tobacco and cigarette mar-kets. The future for other crops is relatively bright, though it depends on future U.S. agriculturalpolicy and the development of the world livestock industry. For instance, the Freedom to FarmAct could have major impacts on the profitability of Kentucky grain production. The worldlivestock industry will undoubtedly continue to expand as incomes throughout the world riseand meat consumption rises along with it. This increased demand for meat will impact the U.S.in one of two ways: through increased U.S. livestock product exports (as we have seen in recentyears) or through increased U.S. grain exports to feed the larger livestock inventory outside theUnited States. Either scenario will be a positive development for Kentucky grain producers.There are important trends in Kentucky agriculture that are making it more internationallycompetitive. An important factor behind that trend is continuing trade liberalization throughoutthe world that gives U.S. and Kentucky producers more ready access to global markets. Thediversification of Kentucky agricultural production is also improving competitiveness, especiallywith respect to the poultry industry. If the state can continue to diversify into other high valuedagricultural production and food processing, the state's agricultural industry will be well posi-tioned for the decades ahead. Yet even if agricultural producers do not diversify, they will likelysee strong export markets for their main crop and livestock enterprises. 220 Kentucky's Transportation System:Current Trends and Future Issues Several current and future trends promise to affect Kentucky's transportation system. These include:the increasing importance of nonmetro public transportation; the increasing dispersion of manufacturingand service industries; the interwoven relationship between the economy, the environment, and thetransportation network; the expectation that government should do \"more with less\" and the challengesthispresents for fundingthetransportationnetwork;informationtechnologies'impact ontransportation's administration, planning, and operations; and safety. By Ted Grossardt.Kentucky Transportation CenterTransportation systems both guide and are guided by people's day-to-day lives. Decisionsabout where to live and how to connect one's activities are made within an already builtenvironment. At the same time, these decisions affect future investment in that system.The transportation system of tomorrow is then based on the structures and habits of the past,and changed by the conscious decisions for the future. This chapter surveys the problems andopportunities for Kentucky's transportation system, and suggests how they can be managed.Transportation Issues Likely to Face Kentucky in the FutureThe increasing importance of nonmetro public transportation. Kentucky is a more ruralstate than the United States as a whole, with just under half of Kentuckians classified as non-metropolitan in 1990: Like the rest of the country, though, Kentucky continues to suburbanize.These processes have important implications for the transportation system of the state. Whileprojections by the Kentucky State Data Center at the University of Louisville indicate that Ken-tucky's population will shift toward the central part of the state and the major metropolitancenters, recent population trends (1990-95) show greater total population increases in nonmetroareas of Kentucky (Fig. 22.1).' This apparent paradox actually reflects the rapid pace of subur-banization, as most of this nonmetro growth is taking place adjacent to metro areas. At the sametime, Kentucky metro areas are similar to other urban areas in the United States. The number ofresidents in each household is decreasing even as each household paradoxically contains ahigher number of workers. The population is becoming more dispersed and more urbanized asthe population shifts from rural and intercity areas to suburban and fringe metro regions.Suburbanization has led to a commuter circulation pattern that is circumferential rather thancity-centered.' With more, smaller households, the commuter pattern becomes increasinglymultidirectional. This has several long-term effects. Specifically, more workers drive alone.

City-centered public transportation systems serve a decreasing proportion of the popula-tion of the urban area. Nationally, be-tween 1980 and 1990, public transituse dropped from 6.2 percent of allcommuters to 5.1 percent. Kentucky'srate is 1.6 percentless than one thirdof the U.S. level (Figure 22.2). Com-pounding the problem of underutiliza-tion of public transportation istheexpectation that Kentucky will suffer atotal loss of $2.2 million in federaltransit operating funds in 1996.3Kentucky'sruralpublictransitproviders find much of their clientele supported by Medicaid and Medicare funds, and indirectly by the Social Security retirement system. Kentucky may well be looking forward to a populationsorted by age and ruralness, with rural elderly residents contrasted with suburban and youngerresidents concentrated on a few corridors across the state. Population projections suggest a trend toward a higher proportion of older residents in Kentucky' Already, the proportion of Ken-tucky's elderly living in rural areas (44 percent) is nearly twice that of the nation (25 percent),and is significantly isolated in many key ways. It is reasonable, then, to expect an increasingneed for rural public transit. Unfortu-nately, federal support for rural transitin Kentucky will be reduced from $3.4million to $2.7 million in the 1996fiscal year alone. Necessary fare in-creases to offset these and other reduc-tions in public transit support wouldrange from 14 percent in metro areasof 500,000 to 1,000,000 up to 73 per-cent in areas under 200,000 popula-tion. Obviously, these are impracticalalternatives, especially from the per-spective of rural systems that must op- erate long distances over roads of variable quality. Clearly, rural areas are most adversely af- fected by these AlonePublic Transit The increasing dispersion of manufacturing and service industries. The same process of\"dispersion\" that the residential population exhibits is mirrored in the manufacturing and serv- ice industries which serve that population. Commercial locations that formerly were concen- trated in the downtowns are now dispersing throughout the suburban milieu. Likewise, regional shifts in the industrial Midwest continue to disperse manufacturing across the Midwest and into the old South. Facilitating this shift is an increasingly sophisticated system of trucking and in-termodal freight that lowers shipment costs and allows movement toward lower labor cost areas. Kentucky has accommodated the placement of new factories, as well as growing commercialtransportation corridors connecting the South and the upper Midwest. The result has been agrowing truck, rail freight, and intermodal freight network in Kentucky. 3See Federal Transit Administration. (1996). Transit in Kentucky: an analysis of FY 1996 transit funding cuts. [On-line]Available: www.bts.govismart/sam/KY5.html.See G. Rowles and J.F. Watkins, Growing old in Kentucky: the approaching age of age, in this volume.2 9 2 Kentucky's Transportation System: Current Trends and Future Issues 207 To remain economically competitive, Kentucky will need an effective transportation networkfor moving freight. While public sector authority and responsibility is focused on the roadways,all modes (i.e., road, rail, water, air) provide interlinked and complementary services. The pub-lic sector cannot afford to be concerned solely with one mode, as changing conditions in onemode will have repercussions for other modes. Nonetheless, Kentucky's freight system reliesheavily on the truck' As the first results of the 1993 National Commodity Flow Survey show,trucks continue to surpass all other modes combined in terms of value shipped.' In Kentucky,over 75 percent of all commodities (by value) move by truck. Also, the proliferation of just-in-time manufacturing systems has partially shifted the warehousing function of many manufac-turers to the transportation system. As a result, the public sector is not only expected to provideadequate space for this inventory on the highway system, it is also expected to move that inven-tory in a timely manner. More than ever, congestion on the transportation network exacts aneconomic cost. In a practical sense, the public road system has become part of the manufactur-ing process.In the future, the relationship between transportation and the environment promises tobecome more significant. Conventional wisdom normally dictates that growth in transporta-tion and concerns over the environment are at odds. Professors Stephen J. Goetz and Richard C.Ready of the University of Kentucky explored this question in a 50-state study in 1993. Theirfindings indicated higher rates of economic growth in states which showed higher concern forenvironmental quality. In short, environmental quality need not be seen as the antithesis of eco-nomic growth.Intelligent use of energy resources for transportation is critically important when seeking abalance between the two objectives of economic growth and environmental quality. Of all theenergy used within Kentucky, roughly one third is used on transportation. The typical Ken-tuckian travels alone and drives 10,000 miles each year. All travel by Kentuckians consumedapproximately 69 million barrels of petroleum during 1992 alone. This reflects a long-term in-crease in petroleum consumption of 176 percent since 1960. According to a 1994 study, 29 per-cent of Kentuckians (1.06 million) live in counties that have been designated as nonattainmentareas for recommended levels of ozone. Carbon monoxide is a major cause of ozone depletion,and levels in Kentucky have been steadily decreasing since the 1970s, courtesy of newer, loweremission autos.In order for Kentucky to remain a desirable place to live in the future, policymakers will bepressed to identify ways to make transportation more amenable to the already fragile environ-ment. One way to accomplish this is by implementing ways to travel \"smarter.\" An example isthe Advanced Regional Traffic Interactive Management and Information System (ARTIMIS).This system is being built in the northern Kentucky/Cincinnati nonattainment air quality area.With ARTIMIS, travel time and congestion may be avoided by merely tuning a radio, observingelectronic road signs, or by dialing a number on a cellular phone and listening to up-to-the-minute interstate traffic information.Policymakers will be challenged to finance the transportation system as government isexpected to \"do more with less.\" New establishments have come to expect truck service vir-tually anywhere, but this expectation is unrealistic and places unusual demands on the Kentuckytransportation system. Private capital has outrun the capacity of public finance to support itsmovements. Many local roads in Kentucky cannot accommodate 102-inch wide and 53- or even 5 Bureau of Transportation Statistics.

While economic development activities are con-sidered most desirable in areas with the least current activity, such areas are likely to also beleast prepared for heavy truck traffic, and so require the heaviest public sector investment.Strategies to address the need for development must also recognize the limitations of publicsector resources. To date, well-planned industrial parks have been the best strategy for dealingwith the problem and opportunity of economic development. They provide the complete com-plement of public sector utilities needed by industry, location along truck-capable highways, thepotential to encourage railroad use as a supplement to truck traffic, and are an important, tan-gible expression of support for economic development by the local community.Yet, while the expectations for a world-class transportation system have continued to rise,the method of paying for it has not kept pace. The current finance system is designed to use fueland vehicle-based taxes to pay for anticipated maintenance and improvements on the highwaysystem. Under current user fee arrangements, it appears the Road Fund plus Federal Fund willmarginally be able to meet most of the requirements now incorporated into the Six-Year Planplus half of the Long-Range Plan of the Transportation Cabinet. It is important to note, how-ever, that state road funds are restricted by the Kentucky constitution to highway uses. Conse-While the expectations for a world-class quently the public sector is ill-equipped to fully exploit the po- transportation system have continued to rise, tential of an integrated transpor- the method of paying for it has not kept pace. cationsystem. The IntermodalSurface Transportation EfficiencyAct (ISTEA) has encouraged the search for solutions to this long-standing problem. Good po-tential exists to relieve pressure on highways by assisting in the movement of traffic onto railand water, but the public sector currently has few tools to facilitate that process.One finance strategy compatible with current constitutional restrictions is congestion pric-ing. Congestion pricing encompasses a variety of strategies, including fee-permitted zones forcertain vehicles at certain times of the day, or more sophisticated automated tracking and billingtechniques based on Geographic Positioning Systems or ground-based monitoring techniques.Congestion is already paid for in wasted time and accidents. A responsible transportation man-agement scheme would begin to explore ways to use a true pricing model to avoid congestionand use the savings to upgrade the transportation system appropriately.Current and emerging transportation information technology will continue to affecttransportation administration, planning, and operations support. Administrative systems arevital to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of the regulatory agencies they support. Fur-ther, they provide much of the backbone upon which other systems can be integrated. Kentuckyhas a fairly robust network enabling access to key databases, communication via electronic mail,and file transfer. Additionally, the Kentucky State Government network is connected to the In-ternet, affording a much larger \"information marketplace.'\" Nevertheless, there are a number ofemerging technologies that can make this effort more effective.Digital Orthophotography, for example, has the potential to provide detailed information toverify and correct the location and nature of transportation routes and land use locations, includ-ing such hard-to-verify sites as coal tipples.Kentucky's Transportation Cabinet is continuing to support and expand its Highway Infor-mation System by linking it to a Geographic Information System (GIS) to facilitate spatial por-trayal and analysis. A GIS is essentially a software tool which allows the spatial representationof data. That information may pertain to any sort of topic and be arranged regionally (as in land 7 See D. Robinson, Information technology: perspectives and trends, in this volume.224 Kentucky's Transportation System: Current Trends and Future Issues 209 use); linearly, as in highway, rivers, roads, or railroads; or in sites, such as accidents, bridges,intersections, and buildings. A GIS is also useful in allowing the juxtaposition of data otherwisedifficult to compare: potential road construction sites and wetland locations; generatorsand high-accident-rate locations; highway rockfall locations and geomorphological structures;accessibility to bus routes or major transportation corridors; and demographic profiles. Such\"overlays\" provide insights that would be difficult or impossible to infer using any other means.Another technology, still in its infancy in Kentucky, is the use of Global Positioning Systems(GPS) to help locate places and events in Kentucky's growing Geographic Information Systemcoverages. Because GPS has the ability to quickly and unambiguously locate an event, it can beused to locate events such as traffic accidents that now rely on written records which must betranscribed by hand. It can also be used in real time to track the location of commercial vehi-cles, traffic accidents, fires, and congestion problems that impact the operation of a transporta-tion system.Ultimately, the goal of transportation technology applications is to make transportation moreefficient. In recent years a comprehensive national program of transportation technology devel-opment has been pursued under the rubric of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). At thecore of ITS is the realization that transportation safety and capacity problems cannot be solvedsolely by new construction. Using new technology to more effectively manage existing systems,however, offers many benefits with lower costs.Kentucky is nationally recognized as an early leader in the development and deployment ofnumerous ITS projects. Most noteworthy is the Advantage 1-75 Mainline Automated ClearanceSystem which integrates weigh-in-motion (WIM) technologies, read-write electronic transpon-ders, and high-speed networks to improve commercial vehicle operations on 1-75. Further, thisprogrambuilt around an expanding partnership of six states; Ontario, Canada; and industryrepresentativesdemonstrates how public-private partnerships can be leveraged to deploycomplex technology.Public transportation technology applications have two broad goals: improved ability to ex-press demand and stronger capabilities for managing service provision. This translates intosoftware/hardware combinations that automate client location, bus routing, fare collection, fleetmanagement, and bus location monitoring. As with other technologies, the more sophisticatedversions of these rely on GIS/GPS combinations. While some urban transit systems have begunto explore these capabilities, they may have strong benefits for regionally extensive, rural, de-mand-based systems. Combined GIS/GPS systems can be used to track and schedule buses. Thepatrons can use \"smart cards\" to validate and pay for their rides, and the information from thosecards can feed accounting and maintenance information systems to improve the manageabilityof rural transit systems. The role of rural transit systems may well expand with the devolution ofwelfare responsibilities to the states. Low-income people needing to reach their jobs may nothave the resources to provide reliable transportation, and the state may find it strategically use-ful to provide transportation services that assist social service agencies. Information technolo-gies for managing this new demand will become more important.Safety issues will continue to confront policymakers in the future. Trends in the safe useof Kentucky's transportation system are best assessed through consideration of the influences ofalcohol, age, and safety belts. In Kentucky, alcohol-related accidents cost about $101 millionannually. Through increased enforcement efforts, Kentucky's alcohol-related accident rate hasdropped steadily for the past five years. Lowering the BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) limits from.1 percent to .08 percent could continue to point this trend in the proper direction. The teenageaccident rate continues to be three times the teenage license registration rate. Kentucky'sgraduated driver licensing law, one of the few of its kind in the country, limits the hours ofdriving and BAC for teens more severely than other drivers, but has not been in effect longenough to evaluate. Also, safety belt usage in Kentucky has increased dramatically from 4 per- 2 (2 5 210Exploring the Frontier of the Future cent of drivers in the early 1980s, to over 50 percent currently. There is room for improvementhere, though, as North Carolina's more stringent enforcement standards for safety belts haveproduced a usage rate more than 20 percent higher than Kentucky's.ConclusionTransportation makes possible many of the transactions of everyday life. If people and ship-ments are expected to be on time, and the state is expected to facilitate this, then Kentucky mayneed to find creative ways to move people and goods. This includes current efforts to improvethe efficiency of traffic across the network, but should also include exploration of ways to com-plement the capacity and efficiency of the system through load sharing with other modes. Thecurrent financing system will pay to maintain and continue the current transportation system,with the attendant problems listed in this chapter. A funding mechanism that requires unimodalconstruction moneys without explicit consideration of modal complements is not market driven,however. A reasonable strategy might include the use of new technologies to better manage ac-cess to the transportation system, and more intelligent planning to take advantage of the multi-modal possibilities already existing.There are several steps Kentucky's policymakers can take to ensure a robust transportationnetwork well into the future:Provide a mechanism for the optimal use of public sector funds across all modes oftransportation. Under ISTEA legislation, the federal government has already es-tablished a precedent for such flexibility.Pursue an expanded Transportation Planning curriculum in Kentucky's universi-ties. The increased private and public sector investment in logistics and transpor-tation management as an aspect of an effectively operating manufacturing ortransit system is not being formally accommodated by current curriculums.Continue to expand participation in regional management systems based on re-gional economic processes, such as the Commercial Vehicle Information Systemsand Networks projects currently being pursued by the Transportation Cabinet andthe Kentucky Transportation Center.Support the incorporation of intelligent transportation technologies into transpor-tation management as rapidly as possible. This will benefit nearly every existingmode, and may have particularly salutary effects on rural transit, where increasingdemand can reasonably be expected.Plan now for strategies to address the increasing need for rural transit, includingan aging population and increased state responsibilities for welfare reform.Broaden support for functional coordination of transportation and land uses.Planning ahead for industrial parks, schools, airports, and housing developmentswill help the state to use its scarce transportation resources to its best advantage.Kentucky has become recognized as a regional transportation leader in the United States,and has recently been called on to demonstrate and lead important new regional projects in theadoption of ITS technologies for the surrounding states. Let us not forget to apply that hard wonexpertise at home. Information Technology:Perspectives and Trends The full impact of the current information technology and networking revolution remains unknown. Butthe experiences of organizations and individuals who are \"connected\"using the tools and resources of-fered by information technologysuggest that it may change our social fabric. Some of the current andemerging trends in information technology include: the need to provide equitable access; timely solutionsto the \"Year 2000\" problem; and the transformation of organizations. Government will be challenged bymany public policy issues related to information technology, which include, but are not limited to: elec-tronic records storage, and retrieval; and public-private partnerships. By developinginnovative solutions and responses to these trends, we can better position Kentucky for a prosperous future. By Doug RobinsonKentucky Information Resources Management Commissionnformation technology (IT) continues to have a major influence on the lives of Kentuckians'even though it remains seemingly transparent to most citizens. People have accepted the con-venience of an information infrastructure that offers automated teller machines, telephonevoice response, on-line transactions and point-of-sale registers at the checkout line. High-speednetworks traverse the state and nation connecting retail stores to devices that automatically rec-ord purchases, transmit inventory data to suppliers, and keep the products we want on theshelves. While dramatic advances in computing and communications continue at a pace thatnearly defies comprehension, it is evident that IT will continue to improve the quality of life inKentucky, and, simultaneously, createchallenging public policy issues.The convergence of the computingand communications infrastructure hasopened and continues to open new pos-sibilities for access to information anddelivery of services. The advancement ofthisinformationinfrastructure makesKentucky more competitive by providingcriticalsupport for education, healthcare, commerce, and government. In-deed, the information revolution is beingexperiencedwithinmanyKentuckyhouseholds.

Likewise, the view of the \"information infrastructure\" is ex-tended beyond just the physical network of copper and fiber lines to include end-user devices like personal computers (PCs), thedata or content delivered over the infrastructure, and the trained people necessary to effectively use the network.2 Schirmer, P.

The advantages for teachersand for curriculum development are realizedthrough the ability to access information resources from classrooms and to communicate withother educators and resources throughout the nation and the world (via the Internet/National In-formation Highway).The use of IT also permits increased parental involvement through the ability to monitor astudent's progress on a day-to-day basis via electronic postings of homework, timely messagesfrom and interactions with teachers, etc. Increased administrative efficiencies for teachers andadministrators will also be realized through enhanced computing and networking applications insupport of administrative needs, such as attendance, financial reporting, and e-mail.In addition to its profound influence on education, the technological revolution is transform-ing organizations, public and private. Information technology has evolved as an agent of changethat enables timely responses to social and economic trends in a global information-based econ-omy. Marketplace dynamics and a diverse, mobile and aging population require new approachesto the way we select and deploy technology. Additionally, consumer and citizen demands forchoice, convenience, and ease of use in the delivery of goods and services must be achieved, in anera of organizational downsizing and strained budgets. At the same time, deregulation and tele-communications reform promise to turn our view of the \"telephone company\" upside down.While information technology holds the promise of meeting many challenges in the yearsahead, it is not a silver bullet. Several current and emerging information technology trends re-ceive a more detailed examination in the next section.Current and Emerging Trends In Information TechnologyNo one knows the full impact of the current information technology and networking revolu-tion, but the experiences of organizations and individuals who are already \"connected\"usingthe tools and resources offered by technology and communicationssuggest that it-glikely toproduce fundamental change in our social fabric.

Such a network would enable timely access to global information highways and re-sources by any and all Kentucky businesses, governmental entities, citizens and students. Ad-vanced statewide networking to support the operations of Kentucky state government and othersis now a reality. The Kentucky Information Highway (KIH) is a statewide, integrated communi-cations and information network. First brought on-line in 1995, this major state initiative puts 3 Schirmer.

In addition to handling all of state government's communications, the KIH is available tocities, counties, schools, libraries and others across the state at the contract rate for voice and dataservices. This not only directly assists these groups, but also stimulates the expansion of privateInternet service providers, with local Internet access now available in almost every Kentuckycounty.FIGURE 23.2Percent of Adults Who Have Accessed theInternet in the Past 12 Months, by Region50%40%30%20%10% WestCentralEastB uegrassSource: Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center and UK Survey Research Center FIGURE 23.3Percent of Households with a PCby Income and Education of Respondent D High School or LessI2Some College or Voc.

In additionto directly serving state agencies,the network offers tremendousopportunity for applications inthefieldsofeducationandhealth, as well as enabling thedevelopment of our economy. Infact, via the KIH, Kentucky wasthe first state to connect all of itsschool districts to the Internet.The KIH enhances the Com-monwealth's ability to deliver vital public services and provide greater access to all Kentuckians.Providing equitable access is a fundamental and sustaining necessity for equalizing oppor-tunities in both the public and private sectors, especially for those entities located in an isolatedor limited environment. The issue of equity involves providing access to other organizations,citizens and groups via the network, as well as access to information. Recent survey informationfrom the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center and the University of Kentucky SurveyResearch Center shows that access is affected by income, education, and the region in whichpeople live (See Figures 23.2 and 23.3).4 Access must be enabled and secured in support of edu-cation, whether in urban, suburban or rural areas, or in rich or poor neighborhoods. Points or 4 These figures are from Schirmer.4 9 9 214Exploring the Frontier of the Future methods of access or intelligent devices must be provided to those without personal computers toprevent limitations of access due to economic status.The date change to the next century will cause major difficulties in the world of computingdevices. This issue, dubbed the \"Year 2000\" problem, represents the greatest threat to computerssince the chip was invented. Since the early years of data processing, computer programmersstored the year in two digits in order to reduce software code and save costly disk storage. If thecomputer system or its software applications use two digits to represent the year, the change from1999 to 2000 and beyond may disrupt applications and skew the accuracy of calculations. Anybusiness, government, school or organization that uses a computer will be affected by this prob-lem, which affects many of the processes we depend on every day, including payrolls, invoices,inventory systems, payment calculations and credit card transactions. Applications that manageexpiration dates, policy renewals, and financial projections are candidates for failure now becausethey use future timetables. This problem not only affects information technology software, butalso devices that use chip technology in manufacturing, retail operations and production proc-esses.The price tag to fix the problem is significant, primarily because of the magnitude of thesituation and its labor-intensive nature. The Gartner Group, an IT consulting firm, estimates theworldwide cost for fixing the Year 2000 problem at $600 billion. The estimated cost for correct-ing this problem in state government agencies alone is more than $10 million. Many organiza-tions have not addressed the Year 2000 problem because it is so daunting and time consuming. Itmay take months to analyze, change and test millions of lines of software code that support theiractivities. What's more, this massive undertaking must be accomplished while normal businessactivities are ongoing. All existing computers must be tested and new hardware and softwareprocurements must be made that are Year 2000 compliant. If unaddressed, the economic impactcould be enormous as public sector agencies are unable to serve citizens and businesses remainnoncompetitive as they struggle to correct the problem in late 1999.Information technology will transform the operations of businesses. The internal culture oforganizations will change as a consequence of the proliferation of computing and networking.Flatter organizational structures will be supported by the diffusion of and access to informationtechnology by any and all involved employees. Decentralized decisionmaking will be further en-hanced as information and knowledge are made readily available throughout organizations.Structurally, information technology will permit the evolution of the \"virtual office\" throughemployment alternatives such as telecommuting (working from home or remote locations), whichwill change the dynamics of the work environment, as well as workforce characteristics. The ex-panding information infrastructure will also allow \"information intensive\" firms to locate in ruralor remote areas. Liberated from the constraints of time and geography, firms will be able to con-duct business with customers andThe workplace in the near future may not appear vendors. Quality-of-life concernsvastly different from today, but behind the scenes have driven many corporationsinformation technology will be a major force in and individual entrepreneurs tochanging the way organizations do business seek small town and rural loca-tions with the requisite infrastruc- and where they do business. cure to support their operations.Over the long term, this trendcould certainly benefit Kentucky as businesses seek locations with the unique qualities of theCommonwealth. Such trends have prompted state, local and community groups to attract indus-try by providing ready access to telecommunications. Examples include the Kentucky Scienceand Technology Council's rural televillage initiatives in Pikeville and Elizabethtown.230 Information Technology: Perspectives and Trends 215 The workplace in the near future may not appear vastly different from today, but behind thescenes, information technology will be a major force that will alter the way organizations dobusiness and where they do business. The workforce will be comprised of more knowledge work-ers whose jobs will encompass extracting valuable information from internal and external re-sourcesmaking sense of \"what's out there\" and utilizing it to benefit the organization.Outpacing IT's initial objective of processing data faster is the real value enhancement providedby IT to organize, manage, and link information sources and users. Increasingly, these links willembrace outside organizations that have traditionally been disconnected. In turn, metadata issues(information about information) will become a central concern as firms seek to extract meaningfrom the large repositories of information resources.Electronic commerce (EC), which integrates communications, data management and securityto allow organizations to transact business and exchange information electronically, will alsobecome mainstream. EC differs from traditional commerce primarily in the .way information is-exchanged and processed, offering significant benefits due to its efficient capture and processingof standard business transactions. A core technology for EC is Electronic Data Interchange(EDI), a secure computer-to-computer transfer of trading partner data within an accepted set ofstandards. Another technology for EC is electronic funds transfer (EFT), which offers significantefficiencies and enhanced revenues through the immediate, electronic transfer of funds via a bankclearinghouse network. EC may also be represented by other technologies, including interactivetelephone response, fax processing, electronic forms and bar coding.Over the next decade, public and private organizations will move rapidly toward electroniccommerce to support quick responses to changing customer service needs. EDI is a critical com-ponent used to integrate many facets of the electronic commerce trend and involves the use ofsoftware, data transport networks and professional services to allow organizations to shareneeded information. EDI is now mainly operational in the banking, retail, insurance, automotive,government and health care industries, where it enables immediate access and transactions basedon core data elements. The results are such benefits as lower inventory costs, fewer out-of-stockitems, and lower transportation costs. Many firms now view electronic commerce as a competi-tive necessity.Public Policy IssuesAlthough the private sector will provide many of the networks, devices, services and trainingthat comprise the information infrastructure, government participation and resolution of publicpolicy issues is vital. As is often the case, technologyand the ability to utilize it has eclipsed fun-damental policies and procedures available to address concerns over use and misuse, access, se-curity, management and costs. Without a proactive and articulated set of guidelines, the bestinterests of government and the people of Kentucky are not well protected. Private industry willmost certainly build and manage statewide networks, provide the information tools, and developmany of the applications that use the networks. Public agencies will be responsible for most ofthe content, information resources management and service delivery concerns. In the ever morecomplex, technological and bureaucratic information environment of the next decade, the issue ofaccess, digital records, security, privacy and electronic government will require far more atten-tion from policymakers. Several of the more prominent issues are:Electronic Records Management. As more and more public records are created, stored andmanipulated in an electronic format, public agencies must address the realities of network accessand the necessity for electronic dissemination. Citizens and organizations will not only requestbut demand open records in an electronic format. Public agencies should assume a proactivestance and make records available in a format that can be easily transmitted under accepted pro-tocols and that will be available through easy-to-use, low cost services. Also, appropriate archivalmethods need to be enacted to preserve the intended useful life of electronic \"public records.\"231 216Exploring the Frontier of the Future Privacy. Privacy is an important issue that will become critical as more application areas in-volving sensitive information about individuals and organizations are collected and stored elec-tronically by state agencies. Such information includes records of health care, tax returns,government services, driver's licenses, education and personnel data. The ways in which privatecompanies use or misuse personal data receives constant attention. While privacy concerns areeasily appreciated, other less apparent areas are affected as well. For example, while library pa-trons increasingly accept materials in digital form accessed over networks, such acceptance isstill far from universal. Some are concerned that the use of electronic technology provides aneasy way to monitor what people are reading, researching or \"doing.\" Recently, the monitoring ofelectronic mail has become an issue for employer-employee relations.Security. Information securitywhich includes confidentiality, information integrity, andinformation authenticityis an important issue in all of the applications areas considered. Mali-cious pranksters and criminals skilled in computer use pose many potential threats to the securityof internetworked systems. This issue of security from invasions by these parties is vitally impor-tant in several areas: (1) ensuring that medical records are not stolen or modified via networkresources, (2) delivering benefits to the needy via electronic benefits transfer, and (3) in the elec-tronic commerce, manufacturing, and telecommuting areas, securing and protecting proprietaryinformation and transactions. Network security also must be planned and managed as networksproliferate to prevent sabotage such as computer pranks, virus corruption, or the elimination of asystem's operational capabilities.Network Literacy and User Training. User traininglearning how to use the new technolo-gies and applicationswill require new approaches in the workplace, the classroom, and thehome. Understanding the education and training requirements of advanced information technol-ogy applications is a challenge in itself. Increased videoconferencing and distance learning appli-cations through two-way interactive video serve to illustrate the awareness building and trainingneeded to routinely operate and use this technology. In support of the expanding computing andcommunications infrastructure, government will need to provide resources for both basic andapplied IT research, as well as financial assistance for IT education and training. Issues related touser acceptance trends affect this development of \"computing literacy,\" particularly in areas thatextend computer-based information services to new groups of users who have been noticeably\"computer-skeptical\" in the past (e.g., shop floor workers, doctors and the elderly).Organizational Change Management. Organizational learning closely parallels user accep-tance and training. Many applications in the future will involve the development of new ways ofdoing the job and will require reengineering a business and its mission. New ways of functioningthat are distinctly different from current practices will be required to achieve the greatest benefitsfrom high-speed networking applications in many areas. This learning will not always be easy toachieve, and it will require several adjustments: organizational change; new roles and missionsfor many employees; and retraining. In some cases, professionals with career skills developedover a lifetime will be required to make a transition to the workplace of the future.Intellectual Property Rights. Intellectual property rights is an important issue in those areaswhere government and individual intellectual creations (software, images, books) are accessi-bleand subject to copyingby many people, either directly or via high-speed networks. Librar-ies are the most obvious areas where this is a concern, but other application areas such aseducation and government services also are involved. Determining whether a public agencyshould copyright software created for public business is problematic and fraught with uncertain-ties. Presently unresolved issues related to how agencies are to be compensated for their work 2R2 Information Technology: Perspectives and Trends 217 while stillproviding for public \"fair use\" under the proper circumstances will be a key determi-nant of the quality and availability of government information.Information Access, Storage & Retrieval. Flexible and timely access to all of the informationresources contained across the marketplace of networksthe knowledge of what information isavailable, where it is, and how to get it in a timely fashion and in a useful formis important.Such access requires that the information not only be available, but also maintained and keptcurrent. Access to timely, useful information is especially important in applications areas such asgeographic information systems, libraries, manufacturing, and environmental monitoring, wherelarge quantities of data must be sorted, stored, retrieved, and managed. The issues related to theoperation of \"information locator\" services present additional management complexities and re-source requirements.Public-Private Partnerships. As the development of secure IT. infrastructure necessitateslarge expenditures and commitments, public policies must address the right mix of public andprivate sector participation. Partnerships must be obtained to protect the investment of both sec-tors. Additionally, appropriate incentives for the private sector must be offered to sustain com-petition and investment in IT research and development. Similarly, perspectives and approachesmust be endorsed by both sectors to sustain a progressive IT environment that will permit a satis-factory technology transfer process. Effective IT management involves maintaining innovativeand responsive policies to allow the maximum benefits from timely deployment of rapidlychanging technologies.ConclusionInformation technology will be an agent of change in the 21st century, one that will continueto compel attention to the development and maintenance of critical infrastructurea basicbuilding block for the future of Kentucky. With the appropriate infrastructure in place, organiza-tions, especially in the public sector, can effectively use information technology to promote, re-fine, and speed services to the public. In order to do so, new skills and resources, as well as themanagement of inevitable organizational change, will be required to capture full use of the im-mense potential of information and communications technology.Significantly, information technology enables innovation, creativity and competitive advan-tage that can enhance performance in both the public and the private sectors. Consequently, theability to effectively use and manage IT is not only a challenge for all sectors of the Common-wealth, it is an economic imperative. However, given its inherent complexity and its cost, strongpartnerships between the public and private sectors will be necessary to bring the full benefits ofIT to all sectors. Over the long term, the strategic application and management of IT can helpKentucky maximize the use of limited resources to meet its pressing needs, achieve a strongercompetitive position in the global economy, meet the increasing demand for customer service,increase confidence in government, and approach solutions differently in such areas as educationreform, employee development and empowerment, flexible manufacturing, and industrial revi-talization. IT is, in effect, a tool for change that can enable the Commonwealth to realize more ofits tremendous potential in the new millennium. 23.S Section IVEnvironmental Trends and Futures Conventional wisdom long held that governments which take a strong stand on issues ofenvironmental protection run the risk of inhibiting development and income growth.This assumption still surfaces as the basis for political action in spite of the strong envi-ronmental commitment a significant majority of citizens consistently express. It rests on thepremise that strict environmental standards exact a cost borne by enterprises and, in turn, bytheir employees, their families, and their communities. But research increasingly refutes con-ventional wisdom. Indeed, a clear correlation between strong regulatory environments and in-come growth has been found at the state level in a number of studies, findings whichrecommend a new paradigm for economic development, one that systematically supports andadvances environmental quality. Such a paradigm underscores the importance of the work pre-sented here, that of tracking our environmental progress and anticipating the stresses that couldadversely affect environmental health and, in turn, our economic vitality in the years to come.The good news is that environmental quality is steadily improving in Kentucky. As LeslieCole details in Kentucky's Environment, we continue to show signs of recovery and the restora-tion of environmental health, largely due to regulatory requirements imposed on municipalities,businesses, and industries over the past two decades. These rules, along with billions of dollarsin private and public sector investments, have resulted in cleaner air, water, and landscapesacross the state. At the same time, our economy has continued to expand. But much more re-mains to be done to ensure a safe and healthy environment for future generations of Kentucki-ans, one that will enable, rather than inhibit, prosperity.In Kentucky's Economic Trends and Environmental Futures, Peter Meyer further illustratesthe inextricable link between Kentucky's economy and its environment. As Dr. Meyer's projec-tions show, the economic development policies we adopt today will affect the quality of our en-vironmental assets tomorrow. Forward-looking legislation and policy are dependent uponinformation about the effects of different mixes of the pursuit of economic development and thepromotion of environmental protection in Kentucky. Because the choices before us involvetough decisions, policymalcers must be provided with adequate information about projected out-comes of the choices they confront.Indeed, as Kentucky's economy grows, measuring environmental quality will become in-creasingly important to our efforts to ensure its protection. The problem is not one of tradeoffsbetween the environment and the economy, but rather the development of policies and programsand private sector practices that will protect the environment in order to permit more economicdevelopment. As Dr. Meyer illustrates, inattention to environmental issues will almost certainlyadversely affect our development options.As we noted in our first biennial trends report, The Context of Change, the systematic col-lection, management, evaluation, and reporting of data that enables effective long-range envi-ronmental planning is critical. With such information, policymakers, regulators, and theregulated community can more effectively target investments, creating a positive ripple effectthroughout our economylower taxes for citizens and more public and private resources forinvestment in future growth. In short, knowledge is key to our ability to achieve environmentalhealth and preserve the immense beauty of this state, assets which are irreplaceable and essen-tial to the goal of sustainable development.234 Kentucky's Environmental Trends:Progress and Problems While environmental quality is improving in Kentucky, much remains to be done. For example, toxicspills have increased; more than half of the state's drinking water was in violation of one or more safedrinking water standards in 1995; and our forests and other natural resources remain at risk from unre-stricted development, neglect, and pollution. On the bright side, 56 waste sites have been closed and 24state-of-the-art facilities are operating in Kentucky today; statewide participation in garbage programs isat 80 percent compliance; and we are well within sight of reaching our recycling goal of 100 million tonsper year. Moreover, air pollutants in Kentucky have been declining since monitoring began in 1980. Today,we are well below the national standards for public health safety. As Kentucky's economy grows, measur-ing environmental quality will become increasingly important to our efforts to ensure a viable and sustain-able environmental future. By Leslie ColeEnvironmental Quality Commissionentuckians place a high value on a clean environment. Poll after poll reveals that theenvironment remains a top public concern. For example, a 1994 public opinion survey,onducted by the University of Kentucky found that more than half of the respondentssupported a healthy environment at the expense of economic development.' A 1996 University ofKentucky poll also found that Kentuckians want the state to spend at least 50 times more on envi-ronmental programs.' The poll further revealed that the environment ranks behind only educationand health care among the priorities Kentuckians would set for state spending. Currently, lessthan 1 percent of the state budget is allocated to environmental programs.National opinion' surveys echo similar sentiments. A 1995 poll, commissioned by the Coali-tion of American's Children, found that 93 percent of Americans support setting federal envi-ronmental standards at levels strong enough to protect children's health.' Many of those polledvalued children's health more than reducing government spending and would be willing to bearthe regulatory costs of protecting children if they were passed down to consumers. A September13, 1996, survey, conducted by Princeton Survey Research for Knight-Ridder Washington Bu-reau, also indicated that 45 percent of Americans considered the environment among the mostimportant problems facing the country.\u00b0Public opinion about the environment has long guided government response. Public concernsled to the enactment of numerous federal environmental laws in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.And these laws have been responsible for the significant progress made in restoring the environ-ment.For example, the Clean Air Act of 1980 has resulted in concentrations of many air pollutantsin Kentucky declining to their lowest levels since monitoring began more than two decades ago.Further, a 25 percent reduction in the amount of toxic chemicals reported released to the envi-ronment by Kentucky industries since 1988 has been attributed to the 1986 federal Right-To-Know Law. And federal and state solid waste rules passed in the 1990s have resulted in the clo- University of Kentucky Survey Research Center. (1995, November). Annual Kentucky survey.

Drinking water quality, particularly for thousands of Kentuckianswho depend on private wells and small drinking water systems for supplies, is marginal at best.Kentucky's drinking and wastewater infrastructure will require billions of dollars in investmentsto upgrade and improve operations. Contaminated runoff from cities, abandoned mine lands, andfarms, along with discharges of improperly treated sewage, continues to make many waterwaysunfit for swimming, fishing, and other uses. Environmental degradation threatens the health andeconomic well-being of small rural communities as well as inner city neighborhoods located nearcontaminated waste sites and pollution sources. And our forests and other natural resources re-main at risk from unrestricted development, neglect, and pollution. Little data are available todocument how much timber is being removed from Kentucky's forests, but many suspect thatlogging has increased considerably in the past few years due to demand and rising stumpageprices.But many of the federal laws and programs which brought about the benefits of cleaner air,water, and land are now under attack as too costly and inflexibleunable to address the currentenvironmental needs and issues of the day. Regulatory reform is a common theme heard from theWhite House and the halls of the U.S. Congress to the offices of the Kentucky General Assembly.The President's Council of Economic Advisors in its 1996 Annual Economic Report to Congressincluded, for the first time, a chapter on environmental regulations. The report details variousoptions to reinvent environmental regulations based on the notion that changes in our economy,knowledge, technology, and society call for changes in regulatory policies.' In the 1995 publica-tion Setting Priorities, Getting Results, A New Direction for the Environmental ProtectionAgency, the National Academy of Public Administration calls for \"A system that would rely moreheavily, though not exclusively, on the ability of individuals, firms, communities, and states tomeet national environmental standards in a way that makes the most sense to them.\"6While meeting environmental standards set to protect public health and the environment willremain the heart of environmental programs, Kentucky and other states will be given moreflexibility in designing their own approaches to achieving environmental quality. State efforts toreinvent environmental regulation are taking on a variety of forms ranging from targeting areasof greatest need, integrating risk-based decisionmaking, reengineering permits, developing in-centive and customer-based initiatives, and shifting from prescribed methods of' regulatorycompliance to specifying desired outcomes.But is Kentucky ready to take on the responsibility of designing its environmental future?There are arguments on both sides. Environmentalists argue that environmental policy will bedriven by economic interests rather than need and public accountability will be lost. The regu-lated community counters that it is in their best interest to meet or exceed environmental stan-dards, particularly if they can use their own cost-effective strategies.As Kentucky moves into the 21st century, one thing is certain for the environment and that ischange. Change in the way we view and understand environmental problems. Change in thepolicies and tools used to address them. And change in the government's role in achieving a de-sirable and sustainable environmental and economic future. What is crucial is that Kentuckianshave an active part in designing that future. 5 Council of Economic Advisors. (1996, February). Economic report of the president.

These rules, along with billions of dollars in private and public sector investments, have ledto cleaner air, water, and landscapes across the state while our economy has grown and pros-pereda strong indicator of the complementary role a healthy environment plays in a strongeconomy. But much more remains to be done to ensure a safe and healthy environment for futuregenerations of Kentuckians.Air QualityData collected in 1995 from the state's 113 air quality monitors in 34 counties reveal that theaverage concentrations of many pollutants in the air were at their lowest levels recorded sincemonitoring began in Kentucky two decades ago. For example, concentrations of carbon monoxide(CO), an air pollutant formed when the carbon in fuels from cars and other sources is not burnedcompletely, fell 42 percent in the state during the past two decades. Average CO levels during1995 were well below the standards set to protect public health. The improvements are primarilydue to pollution controls on automobiles.Another success story is sulfur dioxide (SO2). SO2 is formed when fossil fuel containing sul-fur, such as coal, is burned. Power plants are responsible for 90 percent of the sulfur dioxideemissions in the state. Between 1980 and 1995, the average concentrations of SO2 in the air de-clined 29 percent. These improvements are attributed to the federal Clean Air Act Amendmentsof 1990 which required 10 of the state's 21 power plants to reduce SO2 emissions 30 percent to40 percent below 1980 levels by the year 2000 to address the threat of acid rain. The installationof pollution control equipment, such as scrubbers, at many power plants in Kentucky reducedSO2 emissions 40 percent between 1980 and 1995. Measures to reduce sulfur dioxide emissionshave also likely led to improvements in the pH of Kentucky's rainfall. Since 1985, rainfall atmonitored sites in four Kentucky counties has become generally less acidic.Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) belongs to a family of highly reactive gases called nitrogen oxides(NOx) a brownish gas produced by fossil fuel combustion from sources such as cars and powerplants. This pollutant can irritate the lungs and lead to respiratory infections. NO2 is also associ-ated with atmospheric reactions that produce ozone and acid rain. While all Kentucky regionscurrently meet the health-based standard for NO2, Kentucky. ranks 11th in the nation in NOxemissions. Large sources of NOx, such as power plants, will be required to reduce emissions by30 percent to 40 percent by the year 2000. In Kentucky, NO emissions from power plants in-creased 14 percent between 1980 and 1995. The lack of emission reductions are attributed to thehesitancy of industry to invest in controls until federal regulatory uncertainties are resolved.Levels of small particles in the air are declining in Kentucky. Particles of dust, dirt, and sootare emitted by many sources including cars, agriculture operations, and construction projects.These particles can be inhaled into the lungs and damage tissue and lead to premature death. Allregions of the state currently meet the particulate standard of 10 micrometers or less, known asPM-10. However, the U.S. EPA is considering a new more stringent standard which would limitfine particles of 2.5 micrometers or less.A more protective ozone standard is also under consideration by the U.S. EPA. Of the sixprincipal air pollutants, ground-level ozone has been the most difficult to control. Kentucky wasamong 35 states that exceeded the ozone standard during 1995.' Ozone is produced when emis-sions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), such as solvents and automobile exhaust, and nitro-gen oxides (a byproduct of combustion) react with sunlight and heat to form smog. According to 7 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). (1995, December). Comparison of preliminary 1995 ozone concentra-tions to 1993 and 1994.Washington, DC: Author.237 224Exploring the Frontier of the Future a 1995 American Lung Association survey, 432,516 people in Kentucky, or 11 percent of thestate's population, suffer from lung cancer or chronic respiratory diseases that can be complicatedby exposure to ozone and other air pollutants.' Ozone pollution not only affects people with im-.paired respiratory systems, but healthy adults and children as well.There are numerous small and large sources contributing to ozone pollution including auto-mobiles, manufacturing plants, coal-fired power plants, and gas stations. While most regions ofthe state currently meet thenational ozone standard, itis still considered a probleminthe urban airshedsofnorthernKentucky/Cincinnati (which includesBoone,Campbell,andKenton counties) and theJeffersonCounty/SouthernIndiana region (which in-cludes Jefferson and por-tions of Bullitt and Oldhamcounties). Efforts to are ongoing, Kentucky regionsexceeded the standard dur-ing 1995.Other air pollutants receiv'ng increased attention are toxic chemicals known or suspected ofcausing cancer or other serious health effects, such as birth defects or reproductive problems.During 1994, the most recent year for which data are available, 424 industries in Kentucky re-ported releasing 36.2 million pounds of toxic chemicals to the environment, 97 percent of whichwas to the air.'But data also reveal that releases of 17 toxic chemicals to the air prioritized by theU.S. EPA for reduction because they are considered highly toxic, carcinogenic, or released inlarge volumes, have declined 35 percent in Kentucky since 1988, representing important progressin reducing human exposure to toxic air pollution. The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments willfocus additional attention on reducing toxic air emissions and require technology-based standardson major emitters of 189 toxic air pollutants by the year 2000.The release of certain chemicals such as carbon dioxide and chloroflurocarbons are also be-lieved to be affecting global temperatures. A 1996 Kentucky study found that an estimated 205million pounds of these greenhouse gases were released to the state's atmosphere during 1990,primarily by power plants and from the use of chemical refrigerants.'\u00b0 Although scientific uncer-tainties remain concerning the potential effects of greenhouse gases on global climates, policy-makers at the international level enacted a treaty in 1992 to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at1990 levels by the year 2000.The loss of the protective ozone layer in also believed to be contributing to global warming byallowing more of the sun's rays to pass through the earth's atmosphere. The ozone layer, whichsurrounds the earth and shields out ultraviolet radiation, is being destroyed twice as fast asthought. Excessive exposure to UV-B radiation can cause skin cancer and damage crops andlivestock. In 1994, Kentucky industries reported releasing 5.6 million pounds of ozone depletingchemicals, ranking the state second in the nation in emissions of chemicals associated with ozone0.160.14., 0.120.11 ,0.0880.060.040.020FIGURE 24.1Air Concentrations of Pollutants In Kentucky '80'85year'90'95'Yearly air concentrations from state monitored sites based on the following: Ozone-secondmaximum one-hour average.

Reported releases of 11 ozone depleting chemicals emitted by Kentucky industries fell52 percent between 1991 and 1994.Many of the air quality improvements are due to various federal, state, and local regulatorymeasures to control air pollution from both large and small sources. The Kentucky Division forAir Quality currently regulates 2,082 air pollution sources and the Jefferson County Air PollutionControl District regulates 1,587 sources. About 10 percent of these sources were in violation ofair quality rules in 1995, 217 of which were fined.Many large air pollution sources will be required to apply for new air quality Title V permitsin 1996. The Title V program, required under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, is de-signed to improve the permitting process. The permit applications, due December 1996, are ex-pected to take three to five years for the state to process and will be funded by fees charged to airpollution sources. In fiscal year 1995, $5.5 million in fees were collected by the Division for AirQuality from 963 sources. This amounted to a fee of about $34.35 per ton of pollutant. emitted.The fees accounted for 64 percent of the division's budget in 1995.Waste ManagementManaging Kentucky's waste has long been a challenge. But during the past decade the statehas met this challenge head on and passed numerous laws and regulations to further promote theproper disposal of waste. Yet despite these efforts, improper disposal of solid and hazardouswaste still threatens our environment.Kentuckians are producing more waste than ever before, about 4.4 pounds per person.'2 Butmore Kentuckians are now disposing of their waste properly. About 161,000 more Kentuckyhouseholds participated in a garbage collection program in 1995 than was the case in 1994. It isnow estimated that 1.17 million or 80 percent of the state's households are disposing of theirgarbage properly. However, participation rates vary across Kentucky. For example, 17 countiesreport less than a 50 percent household participation rate in garbage collection services.\"Most of the municipal solid waste generated in Kentucky is disposed of in 24 state-of-the-artmunicipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. Nearly 3.6 million tons of municipal waste and 72,000tons of industrial solid waste were disposed at these landfills in fiscal year 1995-96. This repre-sented a 14 percent decline from the previous year. The decrease may be due to the diversion ofwaste to other facilities such as the 132 construction and demolition debris landfills now operat-ing in the state and the recovery of materials for recycling. County solid waste reports reveal thatabout 1 million tons of waste, about 24 percent of the waste stream in Kentucky, was divertedfrom landfills in 1995 for recycling and composting. But plunging prices for paper, cardboard,and other recyclable commodities in 1995 and 1996 threaten many recycling programs in Ken-tucky.Kentucky has 25 years of statewide capacity permitted at the 24 MSW landfills, compared toless than five years of capacity just four years ago. As anticipated, tipping fees have increased dueto the more stringent state and federal landfill construction and operating standards. Nationwide,municipal solid waste landfill tipping fees have increased 400 percent since 1985.\" The averagelandfill tipping fee in Kentucky has increased 27 percent since 1993 and now average $27.49 perton.\" Average household garbage collection rates have almost doubled, increasing from $5 amonth in 1992 to $9.70 per month in 1995. \" Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection.

These land-fills were issued closure permits in thespring of 1996 and are required to monitorgroundwater for the next two years. Already,13 old landfills have detected groundwatercontamination. One landfill, Roe Creek inLawrence County, was classified as a stateSuperfund site in 1995 after bags of asbestoswere found washing into a nearby creek.The state has spent $117,000 to contain theRoe Creek site and recently fined the com-pany $4.6 million.The state has placed increased priorityon the clean up of solid waste dumps in thepast few years. During 1995, a record 1,761open garbage dumps, were cleaned up bylocal governments at an average cost of$2,135 per dump. And more is being doneto enforce open dumping laws. More viola-tions of local open dump ordinances werecited in 1995 than in any previous year.Most of the 4,739 violations cited were re-solved out of court; only 29 percent resultedin court action.Tire piles have received increased atten-tion as well. In 1996, six of the largest sites, containing 1.8 million tires, were or are in the proc-ess of being cleaned up at a cost to the state of $1.6 million. But 187 tire piles, along with hun-dreds of open garbage dumps, remain scattered across the state and resources are limited toaddress many of these sites.The state has also made headway on cleaning up contaminated hazardous waste sites. Duringthe past two years, 500 contaminated waste sites were identified and 326 were remediated. Thecleanup of Kentucky's 20 federal Superfund sites, while oftentimes slow, continues. Close to300,000 Kentuckians, 42,000 of which are children, live within four miles of a federal Superfundsite.'6 Cleanup activities at five of Kentucky's federal Superfund sites have been completed andnow are in long-term monitoring and maintenance.For most federal Superfund sites, monitoring and maintenance will last for many years. Forexample, Maxey Flats, a federal Superfund radioactive waste site located in Fleming County, willbe monitored for hundreds of years. Four hundred responsible parties recently agreed to pay $60million to contain the 4.75 million cubic feet of mostly low-level radioactive waste dumped at thesite. 16 Landview II. (1995, April). Mapping of selected EPA-regulated sites.210 Kentucky's Environmental Trends: Progress and Problems 227 Addressing urban commercial or industrial contaminated sites, known as brownfields, hasalso received increased national and state attention. It is estimated that nationwide there are130,000 to 450,000 contaminated commercial and industrial urban sites. These sites are dispro-portionately located in communities of color or in poor neighborhoods. Louisville was selected in1995 as one of the U.S. EPA's 50 brownfield pilot projects to assess, safely clean up, and sus-tainably reuse brownfields. Brownfields cost the city about $8.7 million in lost property tax reve-nues and have significantly affected the revitalization of inner-city neighborhoods.\"FIGURE 24.3Statue of Contaminated Waste Sites in Ketrducky Federal Superfund Sites Cleanup by ResponsiblePartiesCleanup by State Non-emergency Cleanup by State Priority Sites No. w/Contamination Investigated Potential SitesAs of September 19960 Asof December 1994 02004006008001,0001,2001,4001,6001,800Number of SitesSour e: KY Division of Waste ManagementAbout 530 leaking underground petroleum storage tanks are in long-term cleanup since thestate began to regulate these tanks in 1986.

Buthalf of the 20,368 active underground storage tanks in Kentucky still require closure, removal, orupgrading to meet the 1998 federal spill and corrosion protection requirements.Safe Drinking WaterMore Kentuckians now have access to drinking water treated and supplied by a public watersystem. About 80 percent of the state's households are served by public drinking water.\" But howsafe is the drinking water piped to our homes and businesses? In 1995, 51 percent of the 767public drinking water systems operating in the state had one or more violations of drinking waterrules. Most of the violations were monitoring and reporting infractions, although 39 systems didexceed drinking water standards. The most common violations of the drinking water standardswere coliform bacteria and turbidity which are indicators of microbiological contamination. Fif-teen plants also violated the standard for trihalomethanes, a suspected cancer-causing organicchemical created as a byproduct during the disinfection of drinking water.A majority of the drinking water violations continue to be committed by small systems serv-ing 3,300 or fewer people. In 1995, 338 of these small systems accounted for 93 percent of theviolations cited. Many small systems do not have the expertise, equipment, or resources to meetdrinking water standards. 17USEPA.(1996, February).EPA brownfields pilotLouisville, Kentucky.

Washington, DC: U.S. Dept. of Com-merce. 2 4 1 228Exploring the Frontier of the Future While treated public drinking water is generally considered safe for consumption, the vulner-ability of water supplies to contamination do not permit us to take its quality for granted. Evi-dence of this risk to drinking water can be seen in the waterborne disease outbreaks reported in17 states during 1993 and 1994.\" While the last waterborne disease outbreak in Kentucky wasmore than 10 years ago, the threat still remains.FIGURE 24.4Kentucky Households Served by PublicDrinking Water - 74.9%1:125 - 49.9%IN1- 24.9% Source: 1990 U.S. Census of Population and HousingTurbidity contamination is a particu-lar concern. Inadequate water treatmentfor turbidity was associated with thedeadly waterborne disease outbreak inMilwaukee in 1993 which hospitalized4,000 people, 100 of whom died. Theoutbreak was caused by Cryptosporid-ium, a pathogenic organism transmittedthrough the feces of infected animals.Consumption of the parasitic cyst causesgastrointestinal problems. While mostpeople recover within a few weeks, chil-dren, the elderly, cancer patients, andpeople with AIDS are at risk from pro-longed illness and possible death. Morethan 15,000 people were served by watersystems with persistentviolations ofbacteria and turbidity rules during 1995. It is not known how extensive \"crypto\" is in Kentuckysince monitoring for the parasite in drinking water is currently not required. The U.S. EPA willrequire large drinking water systems to begin monitoring for the parasite in 1997.Chemicals pose another threattoKentucky's drinkingwater.The Division of Water recentlycompleted a round of tests for 68chemicalsatdrinkingwaterplants. The tests, conducted from1993 through 1995, detected un-safe levels of chemicals in thedrinking water of 47 systems.These systems serve an estimated187,000 people. Some of thechemicals found occur in naturebut can also be a byproduct ofindustrial use. Based on these andother tests, 20 advisories wereissued by the Division of Water in1994 and 1995, warning consum-ers not to drink the water due tochemical contamination.Even if the water at the treat-ment plant is safe, there is still apossibility that by the time it reaches a home or business it could be, contaminated. A Centers forDisease Control study found that during the past decade, 24 percent of the waterborne diseaseoutbreaks were attributed to contamination of drinking water in the distribution system. In manyareas of the state, distribution systems have not been maintained, resulting in deterioration, leak-120 10080a)600z4020FIGURE 24.5Public Drinking Water Advisories, Noticesin Kentucky, 1985-1995 I:1,MM 1985 1986 1987 1988 1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 19950 Boil Water Notice 0 Boil.

Water systems in Kentucky lose, on average, 41 million gallons of water eachyear.\" Deteriorating pipes not only can cause water loss, they can also allow infiltration of con-taminants during pressure losses. During 1994 and 1995, 173 boil water notices were issued inKentucky primarily due to line breaks. This is a significant increase from past years which isattributed to greater efforts by water systems to report line breaks and educate the public aboutpossible contamination problems.The increase in boil water notices also reinforces the need to upgrade Kentucky's drinkingwater infrastructure. Most water systems are more than 30 years old and require improvements.Each year millions of dollars are spent on upgrading systems. But more is needed. A drinkingwater revolving loan fund was recently established at the national level to provide states with upto $1 billion to fund infrastructure improvements and other activities to meet the 1996 amend-ments to the Safe Drinking Water Act. While water system investments can be costly, the Envi-ronmental Quality Commission finds that the average monthly household in the state still onlypays about 64 cents per day for treated drinking water.'Many communities have recognized the need to do a better job in planning for future watersupplies. In Kentucky, 115 counties are in the process of developing long-range water supplyplans. Some communities are also working to protect their water supplies. Of the 382 communi-ties that depend on groundwater for public water supplies, 79 are developing plans to preventcontamination of the resource. However, most Kentucky communities do not have specific plansor programs to protect drinking water supplies.Half a million Kentuckians currently rely on 207,000 private water wells for their drinkingwater supplies. Unfortunately, not much data on groundwater quality exist in Kentucky. Privatewells are not required to be tested for contamination. However, local health departments will testwater wells for bacteria upon request. These tests provide some insight into the quality of privatewater wells. During 1995, 54 percent of the 3,000 private water wells sampled by the health offi-cials tested positive for coliform bacteria. According to state health officials, many private wellsare not routinely tested or properly maintained.For a majority of Kentuckians drinking water is safe. But more must be done to protect sup-plies and provide all Kentuckians with safe drinking water. Recognizing this need, GovernorPatton recently established a Water Resource Development Commission to gather informationand prepare a statewide plan for providing potable water to all Kentuckians by the year 2020. Inaddition, efforts must be made to strengthen training and technical assistance for drinking watersystem operators; enforce safe drinking water regulations while also streamlining monitoringrequirements; develop new, more holistic approaches to protecting drinking water supplies; andestablish an aggressive state education program to inform private water well owners about properwater well testing and maintenance.Water QualityAccording to a 1994 University of Kentucky poll, Kentuckians consider water pollution oneof the biggest environmental problems facing the state. Kentucky's waterways continue to be af-fected by pollution, but there are signs of improvement. Data collected from the 44 monitoringstations show that in 1995, 31 percent of the 5,858 miles of waterways monitored in Kentuckywere affected by pollution, compared to 42 percent in 1993.22 While this is good news for allKentuckians, many waterways still remain unfit for swimming, fishing, or for use as a drinkingwater source.Bacteria remains the top water pollution problem in the state. Just this summer, swimmingadvisories were issued along three of the state's 13 major riversthe Kentucky, Upper Cumber- 20 Kentucky Public Service Commission records.

Frankfort,KY: Author.243 230Exploring the Frontier of the Future land, and Licking riversdue to high levels of fecal coliform bacteria. The public was also ad-vised not to swim or have any body contact with rivers in and directly below urban areas, particu-larly after a significant rainfall, because of the increased potential for exposure to pollution fromsewage.Improperly operated sewage treatment plants were among the greatest sources of water pollu-tion in the Commonwealth, responsible for 65 percent of the bacteria problems in our waterways.About 56 percent of the state's households are connected to sewers and have their sewage treatedat a wastewater plant. During1995, 245 major and minormunicipal' sewage treatmentplants,1,706 minor sewagetreatment or small packageplants, and 1,276 industrialwastewater plants held per-mits to operate in Kentucky.But many wastewater treat-ment plants continue to vio-late water quality rules. In1995, more than 50,000 vio-lations were cited at wastewa-ter treatment plants. Most ofthese violations occurred atsmall package plants (38 per-cent) and industrial wastewa-ter plants (51 percent).Efforts to address waterpollutionfromwastewatertreatment plants and consoli-datesmallpackageplantshave proceeded. Since 1986,733 small package treatmentplants have been deactivated.However, small package plants often remain the only sewage treatment option for small or ruralcommunities. In the past 10 years, 979 new package plants were issued permits to operate in thestate. Continued upgrading and regionalization of wastewater treatment plants, targeted en-forcement at problem plants, financial resources to upgrade facilities, along with a strong pro-gram of technical assistance and training to wastewater treatment operators, will be necessary ifproblem plants are to be brought in compliance with clean water rules.While most of the focus of the federal Clean Water Act has been on controlling pollutionfrom large municipal and industrial sources, poorly maintained septic tanks and illegal straightpipe discharges from homes and businesses are contributing significantly to pollution problemsin many waterways. A survey conducted along the north fork of the Kentucky River in LetcherCounty, found that more than 1,000 straight pipes were discharging untreated sewage directlyinto the water. In Harlan County, 660 residences are known to be dumping raw sewage intocreeks. More than 3,000 homes in Floyd County are discharging sewage to community sewersthat in turn discharge directly to the river. A county-by-county survey would likely reveal thatthis is a problem statewide. Many of the problems associated with straight pipes are localized innature and will require both state and local solutions.Runoff pollution from coal mines and farmlands remains a problem as well. Data frommonitoring stations in Kentucky reveal that coal mining was responsible for 36 percent of theFIGURE 24.6Sources of River, Note: Based on miles affected, major impact. Active and abandoned coal mine sourcesnot combined, not distinctly separated in Water Duality report'Includes combined sewer overflows, silviculture, habitat modification,construction/development.Source: Division of Water, Kentucky 1996 Report to Congress on Water Quality 2 i4 Kentucky's Environmental Trends: Progress and Problems 231 pollution problems found in monitoring waterways.\" Coal mines, both active and inactive, areimpairing 1,021 miles of monitored waterways by contributing sediment, acid mine drainage,and other pollutants. And runoff from farmlands is causing 21 percent of the water pollutionproblems. Agricultural operations are polluting 598 miles of streams monitored in the state withsediment, organic chemicals such as pesticides, and bacteria.\" The Division of Water is nowmoving towards a watershed-based approach to better target contaminated runoff and other pol-lution problems. The Division plans to select a waterway for its pilot watershed initiative in 1996and create local/state partnerships and strategies to address water pollution problems. Anothereffort underway to combat runoff pollution from farmlands is the Agriculture Water QualityAuthority. The authority was established by the 1994 General Assembly to develop plans andwork with landowners to address runoff pollution from farms and logging operations.Toxicchemicalsalsopose problems in a numberof waterways.

During 1995, 3,749 spills were reported tostate offibials, up from 2,097 in 1990. In 1995, 172,000 fish were killed due to spills and otherpollution incidents, the highest number reported since 1989.Fish consumption advisories remain in effect along the Ohio River, the Green River Lake,five ponds in the West Kentucky Wildlife Management Area, Little Bayou Creek in McCrackenCounty, West Four Drakes Creek in Simpson and Warren counties, and Town Branch in Logan,Butler, and Muhlenburg counties due to unsafe levels of toxic chemicals (PCBs, chlordane, ormercury) found in fish tissue.Water quality in some of Kentucky's lakes appears to be improving. Of the 104 public lakesassessed in Kentucky during 1995, 34 were affected by pollution, compared to 36 in 1993.26 Theprincipal sources of pollution to our public lakes include runoff from farmlands and abandonedcoal mines and poorly operated wastewater treatment plants.\"rnc70 6o5400321MonitoredImpairedFIGUREKentucky PercentImpaired24.7Waterwaysby Pollution 80%70%60%50%40%30%20%10%0% 019721981198519871989199119931995 23 Kentucky Division of Water.

New stategroundwater regulations, enactedin1994, will require agricul-tural, industrial, and other op-erations that have the potentialto pollute groundwater, to de-velop and implement groundwa-ter protection plansin1995.While the effectiveness of thisprogramwillbedifficulttomeasure, a new state groundwa-ter monitoring network will provide, for the first time, information on groundwater quality in theCommonwealth. The state began monitoring groundwater at 70 well and spring locations acrossthe state in 1995.Kentucky's waterways face increasing threats as state and federal program budgets erode,resulting in loss of staff and resources. The challenge to reverse the negative trends of water pol-lution will require new and innovative approaches such as watershed-based management, an in-fusion of financialresources, and collective partnerships among federal/state/and localgovernments, businesses, and communities alike. \u00b0 16 Kentucky's Economic Trendsand Environmental Futures Kentucky's economy and its environment are inextricably linkedthe economic development policieswe adopt and the actions we take to implement those policies can, and do, affect the quality of our envi-ronmental assets. Forward-looking legislation and policy are dependent upon information about the ef-fects of different mixes in the pursuit of economic development and the promotion of environmentalprotection in Kentucky. The problem is not one of tradeoffs between the environment and the economy, butthe development of policies and programs and private sector practices that will protect the environment inorder to permit more economic development. By Peter B. MeyerUniversity of LouisvilleKmfentucky's economy and environment are inextricably linked. The economic develop-ent policies we adopt and the actions we take to implement those policies can, and do,fect the quality of the air, water, land, and other environmental assets of the Com-monwealth. By the same token, the quality of the environment can affect Kentucky's ability todevelop its economy. While a despoiled environment can diminish the Commonwealth's attrac-tiveness for development, a clean, healthy, aesthetically pleasing environment can actually serveas a stimulus to economic growth. Thus, it is imperative that public policy pursue a balance ofeconomic development and environmental protection in Kentucky. The resources of the publicsector need to be committed to sustainable development so the Commonwealth can enable peo-ple to accomplish their current economic goals without encumbering the resources and qualityof life for future generations of Kentuckians.Determining where to begin pursuing sustainable development, however, presents a chal-lenge. In order to plan for the future, we must first understand how economic policies and ac-tions affect environmental preservation. The Forecasting Kentucky's Environmental Futures(FKEF) Project sought to begin this process by identifying those policy alternatives and direc-tions that have the greatest potential for achieving both enhanced socio-economic well-beingand a stronger natural environment. Fortunately, but also problematically, policy alternativesand potential changes abound. Economic and environmental policymakers face many difficultchoices such as:Emphasizing reliance on natural gas for automobiles or promoting expanded use ofmass transit where possibleInvesting state resources in educating the public on environmental issues in order topromote more sustainable household behaviors or spending those resources on help-ing companies to adoptand marketthe most advanced environment-protectingtechnologies, showing them how to profit by doing soProviding subsidies to attract new firms wherever they locate in the Commonwealthor targeting support to direct development in particular regionsDeciding between alternative means of stimulating forest products use and secondarywood processing in the Commonwealth, which may have indistinguishable economiceffects but different environmental consequencesAll of these choices involve the pursuit of financial gain for the citizens of Kentucky, but allalso reflect the reality of environmental impactsand decisionmakers are rarely provided with247 234Exploring the Frontierof the Future adequate information on the outcomes of choices they must make. Thus, the importance of thisproject becomes clear: FKEF attempts to provide some sense of the long-term effects of interac-tions between shifts in economic activity and environmental policy.The FKEF project was undertaken by the Center for Environmental Management (CEM), acomponent of the Kentucky Institute for the Environment and Sustainable Development at theUniversity of Louisville (KIESD) for the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center(LTPRC). It builds on the Kentucky Outlook 2000 Comparative Risk project now being com-pleted by the Cabinet for Natural Resources and Environmental Protection (CNREP). The proj-ect combines detailed consultations and focus group meetings involving knowledgeable partiesfrom government, industry, higher education, and environmental organizations with computer-based projection techniques to identify and test alternative environmental futures. To obtainsystematic projections, the FKEF team pursued mathematical forecasts, combining economicand environmental conditions in the Commonwealth around the year 2025. The numericalfindings presented and discussed here come from two sources: (1) The REMI economic modelemployed by the Legislative Research Commission for state economic projections (This type ofmodel automatically extends current trends to the future, so the forecasts are solidly grounded incurrent economic conditions and policy directions.); and, (2) POLESTAR, a decision-supporttool that links environmental conditions to levels of population and gross domestic product.Projecting Kentucky's FuturesIf Kentucky's current economic and demographic trends remain unchanged, the Common-wealth willlikely face serious environmentalproblems. Our baseline projection, which envi-sions no significant shifts in technology, regula-tory practice, production techniques, or patternsof consumption beyond those currently evident ineconomic and demographic trends, shows signifi-cant economic gains, but, as Table 25.1 indicates,at substantial environmental cost. The projected40 percent increase in per capita income andconstant purchasing power will likely exact itsprice in continued deterioration of the naturalenvironment, as future levels of both air pollut-ants and energy consumption will become signifi-cantly worse. In this baseline projection, thetechnical relationships between levels of eco-nomic activity and environmental consequences(emissions, wastes, resource consumption, energygeneration and use, land required for infrastruc-ture and other uses, etc.) were assumed to be effectively unchanged from those that now exist.Of course, this baseline projection is fundamentally unrealistic because it assumes no changein current economic patterns. Thus we also developed a restructured economic projection toaccount for deviations from the baseline in particular sectors. Experts who participated in focusgroups for this project agree that the Kentucky economy will change in five key sectors:TABLE 25.1Changes in Economic and EnvironmentalConditions in KentuckyBaseline Projections for Status wood processingManufacturing attraction and successionTourism2.18 Kentucky's Economic Trends and Environmental Futures 235 While the first two of these changes aredriven by external forces, the last three rep-resent successful pursuit of economic devel-opment by the Commonwealth. In general,therestructuredprojectioninvolvesde-creased reliance on tobacco farming, in-creased demand for forestry yields as inputsto secondary wood processing industries,decreased mining activity, and, increasedmanufacturing and tourism. Such responsesto market pressures would not significantlyalter economic growth expectations, butmight affect environmental impacts. Thesechanges and our rationales for choosingthem are summarized in Table 25.2.Economic shiftsandtheirenviron-mental consequenceswill not, however, beexperiencedsimilarlyacrosstheentireCommonwealth. Kentucky enjoys extensivevariety in its geographic and economic char-acteristics,including mountainousareas,wide open rural areas, and cities of diversesize, all with varying concentrations of income from different sources. To accommodate thisdiversity, the state's REMI econometric model was configured to encompass four regions: Blue-grass, Central, East, and West (See Figure 25.1). While the Eastern region is exceptionallyTABLE 25.2Sectors!

The fastest future eco-nomic and population growth willlikely occur in this region, so notsurprisingly, it promises to be thehardesthitenvironmentallyaswell. In fact, the projected 43 per-centincreaseinground-levelpollutants in the Bluegrass threat-ens to exceed current federal lim-itsandcouldcausetheCommonwealth to lose major fed-eral government funds. The Central region also risks damaged air quality because of powerplant expansions. Figure 25.2A and Figure 25.2B illustrate the variety of air pollution emissionsthat might be experienced across the regions under the baseline economic scenario. 249 236Exploring the Frontier of the Future FIGURE 25.2AGreenhouse Gas Emissions Change, 1995-2025(Baseline Projection, Status Otto Scenario)80E. 60 Emissions Quo Scenario) r-s.EastWestCentralBluegrassTotalOSulphur Dioxide M Nitrous Oxide0 Volatile Organic Compounds 0 Total Suspended ParticulatesMoreover, the possible restruc-turing of the Kentucky economy willnot solve the environmental prob-lems that are emerging.

In bothinstances, we took care toinclude only changes that ap-pear probable at the presenttime. That is, we projectedchanges that seem probableprospects in light of current sociological and behavioral data on environmental practices andcurrently available technologies for reducing negative environmental impacts.

Growing awareness by firms, businesses, and families of the develop-ment problem posed by worsening environmental conditions could over time accelerate interestin, and acceptance of, new practices and available technologies. Moreover, state governmentefforts could, conceivably, systematically attempt to accelerate adoption of available technolo-gies or shift the practices and behaviorsof households, firms, and local govern-ments. Either type of change wouldsignificantly reduce the negative impactsof economic expansion on the environ-ment of the Commonwealth, as Table25.4 illustrates.By way of example, it is clear thateither change could reduce the flow ofwaste to municipal landfills below the 5percent increase that would be expectedunder the current conditions (status quo),withpolicyandpractice changeslargely increased recyclinghaving thegreatest effect. Energy demands couldalso substantiallyand withthem an array of air emissionsbut inthis instance, the greatest improvementwould come from adoption of availableenergy-saving technologies, not shifts inpolicy or behavior.The FKEF project did not attempt to predict which changes would be most likely be adoptedin Kentucky, nor did we derive prescriptions for how to generate the shifts. Our focus groupTABLE 25.4Environmental Impacts in 2025Under Technology and Policy Change Scenarios(measured by percentage change in impact relative to 1995 45I 238Exploring the Frontier of the Future consultations with a broad range of experts identified a series of five possible policy contextshifts that might shape the prospects for such changes:The extent of Environmental Literacy, which would affect people's improved under-standing of the environmental consequences of their actions and decisions, thus affectingthe prospect for changes in policies and practicesThe degree of public acceptance of the principles of sustainable economic develop-ment, reflecting concern for accelerated adoption of available technologies that could re-duce or limit the adverse environmental effects of economic expansionThe need for leadership at the level of state government, in developing, recognizing,and involving the electorate in choosing among policy alternatives that could increasethe prospects for pursuit of the dual objectives of economic expansion and environmentalpreservation or improvementConstruction of needed public works, and upgrading of the infrastructure for trans-portation, water and waste treatment facilities, and electronic data communications fa-cilities in the Commonwealth, with their dual potential impacts on the economy and theenvironmentThe prospect of energy use changes, especially outside the Commonwealth, and theirimplications for the coal market and revenues from mining activity in Kentucky.The prospect for implementation of the types of changes which could reduce the negative im-pacts of needed economic expansion on the Kentucky environment will clearly depend on thecontext in which they are pursued. While these five factors may be critical, as our advisorypanels noted, the trends in them cannot be predicted with any certainty.Findings and Policy ImplicationsThe FKEF project conclusions about environmental futures may be stated simply, if not op-timistically:Elements of the Kentucky environment will deteriorate over the next 30 years undereither economic projection, and even if all the changes in environmentally sensitivetechnologies and in policies, practices and behaviors considered here take place.The levels of deterioration in air quality in particular will be such that environmental factorswill slow the rate of economic growth and make the projected gains by 2025 unattainable givencurrent standards for required minimum environmental quality. Thus the problem is not one ofthe tradeoffs between the environment and the economy, but, rather, the development of policiesand programs and private sector practices that will protect the environment in order to permitmore economic development.Considering the possible changes that might occur in the Kentucky economy and in its envi-ronmental practices over the next 30 years, the project provides additional insights:Consideration of the advisability of economic restructuring should include assess-ment of environmental factors. As our comparison of the baseline and restructured eco-nomic projection illustrates, the anticipated restructuring would involve significantlyhigher pollution levels, which may or may not be acceptable.To the extent to which environmental factors may affect the capacity of the Com-monwealth to increase incomes, Kentucky will face increased environment-incomecomplementarity, rather than rising conflict, as time progresses.This sensitivity of economic prospects to environmental considerations may be geo-graphically concentrated, as our scenarios suggest. Statewide economic development252 Kentucky's Economic Trends and Environmental Futures 239 planning must therefore be sensitive to such vulnerabilities, since environmental deterio-ratioh could easily stymie plans for economic expansion.For the immediate future, state efforts to promote adoption of available environmen-tally-sensitive technologies appear to hold substantially more promise for supporting thedual objectives of economic expansion and environmental protection than do regulatory,attitudinal or behavioral shifts. This relationship may change over time, however, aspolicy context factors rather than public actions themselves affect behaviors, politicalpriorities and the technologies available.However, it is not appropriate to consider technological change and policy andpractice change to be mutually exclusive. They can be very complementary and maywell interact so as to avoid further deterioration of the Kentucky environment as thepopulation and economy of the Commonwealth continue to expand.The pessimistic findings on the trends in Kentucky's environment, and the indications ofpossible means to minimize negative developments are a call for new focus in policy planningand assessment. The issues raised go far beyond the mandate of the Cabinet for Natural Re-sources and Environmental Protection:Kentucky's environmental futures will Elements of the Kentucky environment willbe shaped by transportation policy, edu- deteriorate over the next 30 years undercational policies and practices, land use either economic projection, and even if all plans and economic development and the changes in environmentally sensitive technology policies (NOT simply thevolume of economic activity, but itstechnologies and in policies, practices andtypes), agricultural policies and practices behaviors considered here take place.and so on. A brighter environmentalfuture can be pursued, but only through recognition across the operating agencies of the publicsector in the Commonwealth that the environmental implications of policies need to be consid-ered, both in terms of the direct effects of public actions and in terms of the impacts on privatesector decisionmaking. Without conscious coordinated public efforts to improve our environ-mental futures, we can expect deteriorated environmental conditions; with focused efforts andsome limited but strategic resource commitments, we can maintainand even acceleratethepattern of improvement that we have been fortunate enough to witness over the past 15 years. 253 Section VGovernment and Civic Participation Although the trends examined in this report will surely affect the way we work, the way welearn, and the way we live, they are not forces entirely beyond our control. We canstrengthen or accelerate those trends that enrich our lives and work to change those thatdo not. Even when we cannot affect a trend directly, we can still respond to it in ways that willmaximize benefits and minimize harm. No matter the trend or its effects or our control over it,action is essential. Timely and prescient action will help us create a brighter future for ourselves,our families, our communities. We must act as private individuals, of course, but cooperation andcollaboration are also essential. Thus we conclude this trends report with a discussion ofgovernment and civic participation.William Hoyt compares Kentucky's taxes to those of other states and examines trends inKentucky taxation. He finds that Kentucky's sales tax revenue has failed to keep pace with otherrevenue sources and has led to an increased reliance on the individual income tax for generalfund dollars. By broadening the sales tax base and lowering the rate, Kentucky could create amore stable and efficient tax system. In the next chapter, Peter SchirMer, Michael Childress andCharles Nett look at how the slow growth of Kentucky's revenue may affect future budgets,particularly when combined with the impacts of various demographic, social and economictrends discussed elsewhere in this report. In order to maintain the present level of services,Kentucky's spending would have to grow more quickly than revenue is expected to grow underthe current tax system. As spending for corrections and health and human services continues totake a bigger slice of the budgetary pie, the share of dollars left over for higher education andnumerous other functions is shrinking. Finally, Paul Blanchard examines trends in citizenparticipationthe most fundamental element of democratic government. Voter turnout is loweverywhere, but even lower in Kentucky. Yet voting is not the sole means of public action; manynon-voters are very active in their communities, through church groups, school committees andother organizations. Kentuckians may be more active in, their communities than peopleelsewhere, and groups like the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development areworking to strengthen these important community-level associations.Government and civic participation, like everything else, will be affected by advancingtechnology. In fact, government, particularly at the federal level, has been a leader in providingcopious information on the Internet, on CD-ROM, by fax and by phone. The next major step is toallow two-way transfers of information, which would enable citizens to do things like register anautomobile, receive licenses and permits, and pay taxes and fees. Ultimately, improvedcommunications technology should enable government to be more efficient, to be moreresponsive, and to accommodate the unique needs of citizens. Links between different groupsmay be forged and strengthened as a result of better communications, and organizations in onepart of the state will be able to learn what organizations in another part of the state, like theOwsley County Action Team discussed in Paul Blanchard's chapter, are doing to strengthen theircommunities.Still, peoplenot technologyare the building blocks of effective government and healthypublic life. And trust is the cement that holds people together. In a recent survey, more than halfof Kentuckians said they usually can trust people, compared to less than 40 percent nationally.More than half of Kentuckians also said they have volunteered time for civic, community orcharitable activities within the past year. It is this \"social capital\" which will enable us to seek254 242Exploring the Frontier of the Future solutions to our most pressing problems and to respond quickly and intelligently to the importanttrends affecting our lives. The chapters from William Hoyt and Peter Schirmer, et al., make itclear that government alone cannot pay for all the things we need to do together. But whengovernment works alongside non-profits, school 'councils, community action groups and otherorganizations, they provide an essential public arena in which we can take control of the trendsaffecting our lives, in which we can take action. Trends in Kentucky Taxes andTheir Implications for Future Tax Policy The two major sources of state government revenue are the individual income and sales taxes. Over thepast 20 years, the individual income tax has become a more important source of revenue while the sales taxhas diminished in importance. The diminished role of the sales tax is not the result of legislative efforts; thesteady downward trend is the result of changing economic conditions and consumption patterns. Peopleare spending smaller percentages of their income for tangible goods and greater percentages of income forservices. Therefore, Kentucky should expand the sales tax base to include services to consumers. Taxingservices provided to businesses could put Kentucky services at a tremendous disadvantage against servicesprovided by businesses in other states. By William H. HoytUniversity of KentuckyReforms, or at least changes, in tax codes have become the norm for states since the late1970s, with generally over half of the states enacting notable changes in their tax codeeach year. In 1990, 31 states enacted notable changes in their tax codes; in 1991 and1992, 41 and 40 states, respectively, did so; and in 1994, 37 states enacted major changes.Kentucky is no exception to this trend, engaging in several major changes in its tax code inthe recent past. The 1990 legislative session was particularly active. During this session thegeneral sales tax increased from 5 percent to 6 percent. This legislative session also made severalchanges in the state income tax code, eliminating the deductibility of federal income taxes;creating a low-income tax credit; and conforming to IRS codes. This same session also increasedthe top bracket for the corporate income tax from 7 percent to 8.25 percent. Other major changesin the 1990s include legislating (and then repealing) a 2 percent tax on health care providers andthe exclusion of most private pension income from the state income tax.With states changing tax codes so frequently, we may be led to ask how Kentucky comparesto other states. How has taxation in Kentucky changed in the past 20 years and have we fallenbehind? Do any other changes need to be made in Kentucky?It is these three questions this chapter addresses by providing some general comparisons ofKentucky's primary sources of general revenue to other states as well as comparing Kentucky toother states in terms of the tax burden on its residents. From this brief review, we find that taxrates in Kentucky are close to the national average but tend to be somewhat higher than most ofour surrounding states, perhaps our most obvious competitors for location of new industrialplants and business operations.While tax rates have remained relatively unchanged in Kentucky in the recent past, we showthe same is not true of our sources of revenue. During the past 20 years the role of the sales tax asa source of revenue has diminished dramatically, as its rate of growth has steadily declined whilethe growth in the individual income tax base has remained relatively constant.Despite or, in some cases, because of the numerous reforms in our tax code, significantchanges should be made in our tax code. While there are some obvious changes that might bemade in the individual income tax code, the primary focus of this chapter is on the general salestax, for two reasons. First, given that the Kentucky individual income tax code is similar to thatof the federal government, it is unlikely that major alterations, such as changes in itemizeddeductions or treatment of capital gains, will occur in Kentucky without first being implementedat the federal level. Second, because of underlying economic conditions and not legislation, it is 256 244Exploring the Frontier of the Future the general sales tax that has changed the most in the past 20 years. Revenues from the generalsales tax have not kept pace with either personal income or general expenditures by the state.This is a major reason for the underlying structural deficit that arose during the 1980s andnecessitated the major tax increases in the 1990 legislative session.'After discussing the reasons for the diminished role of the general sales tax and the associatedstructural deficit, we next propose a policy correctionbroadening the general sales tax base toinclude services, rather than raising rates. This, we argue, is a more efficient way to collect taxesand should significantly reduce the structural deficit by providing a tax base that will keep pacewith personal income and expenditures.How Does Kentucky's Tax Burden Compare?Figure 26.1 shows state and local tax revenue as a percentage of personal income for selectedyears from 1965 to 1992. As the figure indicates, Kentucky, while once well below the nationalaverage, had a tax burden comparable to the national average in 1992. In fact, in 1992 Kentuckywas ranked 25th in state and local tax revenue as a share of income.' Compared to a benchmarkset of states (Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia), only West Virginia has a comparabletax burden, with Ohio, Indiana, and Tennessee having lower burdens, as a percentage of income.

Figure 26.2 depicts the shares of personal income collectedfrom the general sales tax, individual income tax, corporate income tax and total state taxes forKentucky, our benchmark states, and the nation. While Kentucky was at the national average interms of its total tax burden as a percentage of personal income, it is far above average in termsof its state tax revenue as a percentage of personal income, ranking 6th in the nation. Figure 26.2also suggests that there are some differences in how revenue is raised in Kentucky. The most I See Schirmer, P., Childress, M.T., Nett, C.C.

Washington, DC: Author. 0 .7.-4 J Trends in Kentucky Taxes 245 striking difference from the national average is Kentucky's heavier reliance on the individualincome tax than most states in the nation: Kentucky collects 2.7 percent of its personal incomefrom the individual income tax while the national average is only 2.0 percent. Kentucky collects2.2 percent of its revenue from the general sales tax with the national average being 2.1 percent. 10FIGURE 26.2State Tax Revenue as a Percentage of Income, 1992 Source: ACIRUSINOHITNWVCorporate0Individual Income0General SalesTotal While comparing states by measuring tax burden as a percentage of income offers someinsight into the tax burdens on residents and businesses in the states, it is not the only measure,or perhaps even the best. One reason for high taxes as a percentage of income might be lowincomes in the state (West Virginia, for example). Presumably, both residents and businesseswhen making a decision about where to locate, to the extent taxes are considered, would considerthe rates, not percentage of income, as the rate will determine how much of their income theywill pay in taxes.Figures 26.3A-C show trends in tax rates for the \"average\" state, Kentucky, and thebenchmark states for the years 1984 to 1994. For corporate and individual income tax rates, thefigures show the top marginal rate. For most states, the lop bracket is reached at a very lowincome ($8,000 for individual income in Kentucky), so most income is taxed at the top rate.These figures suggest that for both Kentucky and the nation, there have been relatively minorchanges in tax rates during this period. As more and more states have instituted a general salestax, the average rate has increased (Figure 26.38). While the top tax brackets for the corporateincome tax rate have increased somewhat over the nation (Figure 26.3A), the top rate has fallenfor the individual income tax (Figure 26.3C). These figures also suggest that Kentucky seems tobe, for the most part, relatively typical, though as Figure 26.3A suggests, its corporate income taxrate is above the national average and that of most surrounding states. While Kentucky's salestax rate is above the national average (this includes states with no sales tax) it is not verydifferent from other states in the region (see Figure 26.3B). Finally, Kentucky is at the nationalaverage in individual income tax rates, but potential competitors Indiana (with a top rate of 3percent) and Tennessee (with a tax only on certain interest income) are very low tax states. 258 246Exploring the Frontier of the Future OhioWest Virginia 6%00Kentucky, Tennessee Indiana3% % 0% Source: ACIR19841986198819901992 Trends in Kentucky Taxes 247 Finally, while the emphasis here is on taxes, we should note that comparing states based onany measure of taxes does not give a full picture of how the state (and local) governmentcontributes to economic growth in a state. Tax revenue is being used to finance numerousgovernment programs and services, including education from state general revenue. To the extentthat residents value these services, taxes must be considered in conjunction with services.Trends in Kentucky TaxationFigure 26.4 shows the percentage of general revenue collected from the general sales,individual income, corporate income, and coal tax from 1974 to 1991. The most pronouncedchange that occurred in the way tax revenue was generated in Kentucky during the 1970s and1980s was the switch from the general sales tax to the individual income tax as the state'sprimary source of revenue. From 1974 to 1991 the general sales tax was reduced from over 40percent of general revenue to approximately 26 percent, while the trend was essentially reversedfor the individual income tax. It should be noted that these trends occurred despite no changes ineither the individual income or general sales tax rates and only limited changes in their bases.The role of the general sales tax was diminished because of economic conditions that determineits base, as will be discussed later. 50 O 402iDcc-al30 ec5 20C. a.10 In .agII\"MMAIMIft--......... %;......;,-,11111r/1111/x...'..!'.1.........''.\"'ner.........,...04,......,..CoalProperty...-41, 1974197619781980Source: Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet19821984198619881990 One reason we might be concerned about the diminished role of the general sales tax isillustrated in Figure 26.5, which shows the year-to-year variability in tax revenue for the fourmajor sources of tax revenue for the general fund in Kentucky. Strict budget limitations (limitedrainy day funds and deficit financing) require short-run stability in tax collections. As Figure26.5 illustrates, the coal and corporate income taxes are unstable sources of revenue, withrevenue froth these sources varying dramatically from year to year. Most of this variation inrevenue has been due to, changes in tax bases, not tax rates. Clearly, sound tax policy suggeststhat reliance on these taxes as a source of revenue should be limited as they are unreliable andunpredictable sources of revenue. 260 248Exploring the Frontier of the Future 100 80 60rn640 820 01-20 -40FIGURE 26.5Annual Author's the Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet1 As Figures 26.4 and 26.5 indicate, the two primary sources of general revenue, the individualincome and general sales tax, have had dramatically different trends over the past 20 years. Theaverage increase in sales tax revenue was 10 percent during the period of 1976 to 1994 and only7 percent for the individual income tax.' However, while the average increase in sales taxrevenue was higher than the increase in the individual income tax, the percentage increase insales tax revenue has been decreasing while the increase in individual income tax revenue hasremained relatively constant over the past 20 years. Between 1975 and 1985, sales tax revenueincreased by 10.3 percent per year while between 1986 and 1994 it increased by 9.7 percent evenwith an increase in the sales tax rate in 1991. In fact, over the past 20 years, the increase in salestax revenue has been diminishing by almost .5 percent per year.\u00b0 Given that the average increasein tax revenue was 10 percent per year during this period, this is an average reduction inadditional revenue of 5 percent per year.Why is the Sales Tax Base Diminishing and Why Should WeCare?Efficiency and Taxation. One of the first principles of designing an \"optimal\" or efficienttax system is to make the tax base as broad as possible. The greater the tax base, the lower the taxrate necessary to raise the desired amount of revenue. Because tax rates distort prices, creating a\"wedge\" between the price paid by the consumer and that received by the producer, this createsan inefficiency or \"deadweight loss.\" At the efficient level of production of a good or service,everyone who is willing to pay a price high enough to cover the cost of producing the goodshould receive it. However, with a tax, the consumer now would have to pay a price that coversboth the cost of the good and the tax; thus the consumer may not purchase a good for which sheis willing to pay at least the cost of the good but not the cost of the good and the tax on it. Forexample, suppose that a hamburger costs $1.00 to produce (including all costs except taxes) and 3 Author's calculations based on data from Kentucky Finance and Administration Cabinet (various years). Comprehensiveannual financial report. Frankfort, KY: Author.4 From Cochrane-Orcutt estimates of the change in sales tax revenue (log(sales revenue)t - log(sales revenue)t.1) on time and adummy for 1991 to control for the changes in revenue due to the rate increase. Results available from the author.261 Trends in Kentucky Taxes 249 some consumer is willing to pay $1.03 for it. Then the consumer will purchase the hamburger..However, if a tax of 6 percent increases the cost to $1.06, the consumer will not be willing to buythe hamburger. This is inefficientpeople are unwilling to pay more for a good (the hamburger)than the cost of producing it. It should have been produced and purchased, but was not.What is particularly relevant for the general sales tax is that the inefficiency created by taxes,deadweight loss, increases dramatically with the sales tax rate. Doubling the tax rate willincrease deadweight loss by a factor of four.' The implication of this exponential increase ininefficiency with an increase in the tax rate is that by broadening the tax base to keep tax rateslower, we can lower tax rates and dramatically reduce deadweight loss. For example, if we wereto double the general sales tax base and lower the tax rate from 6 percent to 3 percent, we mightexpect deadweight loss to decrease by 50 percent.6Why the Diminishing Sales Tax Base? Table 26.1 shows the sales tax base relative topersonal income. The revenue base for the sales tax has decreased from 47.5 percent of personalincome in 1977 to 38.1 percent of personal income in 1992. If the sales tax base in 1992 hadremained at 47.5 percent of personal income, additional tax revenue of $345 million would havebeen collected. Alternatively, a tax base of 47.5 percent of personal income would have allowedthe state to raise $1,411 million (1992 sales tax revenue) with a rate of 4.8 percent rather than6.0 percent. Figure 26.6 shows how growth in the sales tax base has lagged behind bothindividual income tax revenue collections and growth in personal income. 800FIGURE 26.6Relative Changes in Individual Income Tax Revenue,Total Personal Income, General Revenue and Sales TaxBase, Base 41i-00.' 1000197419761978198019821984198619881990 Source: Kentucky Revenue Cabinet and Bureau of Economic Analysis 5 Formally, deadweight loss or excess burden is approximated by DWL=.5e t2 pQ where e is (compensated) price elasticity, t isthe (ad-valorem) tax rate and pQ is revenue from the sale of the good being taxed.6 This assumes that the price elasticities are the same for the goods currently being taxed and the goods (and services) thatwould be included in the expanded tax base.262 250Exploring the Frontier of the Future Kentucky Sales and UseTABLE 26.1Revenue Base and Personal Income1977198219861992Revenue 508.3692.5893.81,411.2Personal Income ($mil) 21,42634,51842,34261,697Base as % of Income 47.4540.1242.2238.12Source: Kentucky Revenue Cabinet Annual Report and Statistical Appendix, from 1975/76-1991/92VOLIn the past 15 years, much has been said about the impact of moving from an economy basedon manufacturing to a service-based economy. While most of the discussion on this issue relatesto employment; the shift from a manufacturing economy to a service economy has alsodramatically changed the nature of the sales tax. As the general sales tax in Kentucky isprimarily on tangible goods and services, as people have been spending a smaller percentage oftheir income on these goods and more on personal services, the sales tax base relative.to incomehas decreased dramatically. Figure 26.7 contrasts growth in receipts on all services, healthservices, and legal services, to growth in personal income and growth in retail and retail foodreceipts. As the figure suggests, services, which are mostly untaxed, have been growing at afaster rate than personal income, while taxed retail goods have grown much more slowly. As aresult of not including a large number of services in the tax base, the tax base relative to personalincome has significantly diminished in the past 20 years. Table 26.2 gives a more detailedbreakdown in the growth of service receipts over the past 20 years. 14 12 10 864 2 0FIGURE 26.7Growth in Services and Retail Industry, 1969-1993 4 Services4 Retail FoodIIII ServicesX Personal IncomeCI Retail 1969197319771981198519891993 While some of the services listed in Table 26.2 are taxed, many are not. Table 26.3 lists thesales tax base for Kentucky based on the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations(ACIR) classification of services. As this table suggests, most services are exempt from the salestax, particularly in personal, business services and professional services as well as repairs.Generally, Table 26.3 suggests that Kentucky lags behind other states in taxing services eventhough most states make little attempt to tax services other than utilities and amusements. 263 Trends in Kentucky Taxes 251 TABLE 26.2Receipts For Services, 1977, 1982, 1987, and 1992Receipts. 61.000.000 Percentage Accounting Services 49.868.293.1133.3168%96%Total Receipts 1,399.13,528.16,007.010,378.0642%194%Source: Bureau of the Census Asdiscussedearlier,broadening the tax base wouldenable us to decrease tax rates.Consider the impact of addinghealth and professional servicestothetaxbase.Combinedreceipts for these services were$1,703.7 million, compared to$2,350 million in the 1992 taxbase.

If trends in both generalexpenditures and sales tax base continue, with general expenditures increasing at a rate equal to264 252Exploring the Frontier of the Future or exceeding the growth in personal income and the sales tax base growing more slowly and itsgrowth rate declining, current tax rates will not be able to provide sufficient revenue. Theinability of current tax rates to continue to provide sufficient tax revenue in the future is referredto as a structural deficit. One remedy is to increase rates on the current tax base while another isto increase the sales tax base by expanding the taxation of services. Expanding the taxation ofservices instead of increasing the rate on our current base is a preferred course of action for tworeasons. First, the inefficiency generated from the additional revenues will be lower becausehigher tax rates, as discussed earlier, lead to much greater increases in inefficiency. Second, byincluding more of the consumers' spending in the tax base, we will have a tax base that shouldnot diminish over time and should keep better pace with both personal income and generalspending by the state. In addition, we might expect the short-run stability of the tax base toincrease. Finally, by having a tax base for which growth mirrors personal income, we, in somesense, place revenues on automatic pilot and eliminate the politically costly consideration offuture tax increases.While expanding the tax base to include services might make economic sense, evidence fromthe attempts of both Kentucky and other states to expand their sales tax base to include services,particularly professional and business services, indicates it may not make political sense.Kentucky has failed in at least two notable attempts to tax services: in 1990, unsuccessfulattempts were made to tax business services, and the health care provider tax enacted in 1990 hasbeen repealed. Other notable failures to tax services include Florida's and Massachusetts's short-lived taxes on professional services in the late 1980s. The most controversial aspect of theseservice taxes is the taxation of professional services used by businesses. In the case of Florida, themajor opposition to the tax arose from the legal and advertising community.In addition to the obvious political opposition the expansion of any tax can arouse, a goodeconomic argument exists for concern about the taxation of business services. Taxing businessservices can lead to tax pyramidingtaxing intermediate goods (purchases of services bybusinesses) in addition to taxing the final product sold to the consumer. This tax pyramiding canlead to a distortion of relative prices of goods by essentially doubling the tax on goods that usetaxable intermediate inputs. To avoid this double taxation, firms might increase in-houseprovision of services such as accounting and legal services, which is likely to be inefficient ifdone to avoid taxes. Thus, there is some economic sense in allowing the purchases of services aswell as tangible products by businesses to be exempt from the sales tax and to tax only servicesand tangible goods purchased by consumers.Another concern related to the expansion of the sales tax base, particularly to businessservices, is whether these businesses will be at a competitive disadvantage relative to businessesin states that do not tax these business services. For example, if Kentucky were to tax advertisingservices, Kentucky firms might seek advertising services from Cincinnati or Nashville. Inaddition, out-of-state firms currently using Kentucky business services might choose to useuntaxed services in a state that does not tax the service.Florida addressed this problem by exempting out-of-state sales of business services from thesales tax and by requiring Florida users of services from out-of-state firms to pay a use tax onthese services. Two difficulties with this solution were that it was difficult to apportion servicerevenues to a specific state for services used in both Florida and other states and it was difficult tocollect the use tax from Florida residents using out-of-state services.'It is worth noting that this same argument about reducing the competitiveness of Kentuckybusiness can, and was in the case of health care providers, be made about consumer services andpurchases. Undoubtedly there will be some loss of business in Kentucky if it expands its tax onconsumer services and surrounding states do not. However, it seems much less likely thatresidents would \"shop around\" to find states where they could avoid sales taxes, particularly onhealth services which are primarily paid for by third-party payers. 7 In fact, Kentucky has the same tax on the use of out-of-state purchases of goods or services that are liable to Kentucky's tax.265 Trends in Kentucky Taxes 253 Principles of tax analysis, particularly those related to the inefficiency associated withtaxation, as well as the changing patterns of consumption, both argue for the expansion of thesales tax base to services. The advantages of broadening the tax base include increased revenueswhile avoiding tax rate increases that lead to substantial increases in inefficiencies. In addition,an expanded sales tax base should become a more reliable source of revenueboth more stableand more likely to keep pace with personal income.ConclusionIn general, Kentucky is a relatively typical state in its tax structure, with its tax rates similarto most states, though perhaps having higher rates than its surrounding neighbors. The majordifference between Kentucky and other states is the much lower share of local taxes in the total ofstate and local taxes, as well as Kentucky's greater reliance than most states on its individualincome tax for general revenue.Kentucky's reliance on the individual income tax does not appear to be a design strategy;instead it is the result of the shift from a manufacturing- to a service-based economy. The resultof the combination of this shift in the economy and Kentucky's narrow sales tax base has led tosales tax revenue failing to keep pace with total revenue. To provide stability and avoid higher,inefficient tax rates, the sales tax base should be broadened to include personal services. 266 $5.8 Billion and Change: An Explorationof Long-Term Budgetary Trends Over the past 20 years, the share of general fund dollars spent on police and corrections, and healthand human services, has increased. Meanwhile, the share spent on higher education has fallen. Thesetrends are expected to continue over the next decade. Overall, revenues will not grow fast enough tomaintain the current level of services, if current trends continue. Also, the rainy day fund is not wellprotected. Kentucky should strengthen funding and spending guidelines for the rainy day fund, improve itsinvestment in education, keep the spirit of reform alive, and change the state tax structure. By Peter Schirmer, Michael T. Childress and Charles C. NettKentucky Long-Term Policy Research CenterG-overnments at all levels are feeling squeezed between limited resources and seeminglylimitless pressures to increase spending, but it was not always this way. Just 30 years ago,when the U.S. economy was robust and expanding, the national debt was much smaller,there were more workers per Social Security recipient, and programs such as Medicare andMedicaid were in their infancy, economists worried about a drag on the economy resulting frompublic revenues growing faster than public expenditures.' In the 1960s, governments had\"structural surpluses.\" Today, governments have \"structural deficits.\"A structural deficit is not a single-year shortfall, which might occur as the result of anunforeseen natural disaster, a new mandate from the federal government, or a sluggish economy.Rather, a structural deficit is a long-term crisis; it occurs when revenues are projected toconsistently grow more slowly than expenditures over several years. Because many states cannotactually run a deficit, certain expenditures may be neglected, sometimes for years, in order tobalance the books.Does Kentucky have a structural deficit? Will the current revenue structure (consisting ofvarious taxes, fees, investments, and governmental transfers) be able to support the current levelof services in coming years, or will spending cutbacks be necessary in order to maintain abalanced budget? This report suggests that Kentucky does, in fact, have a structural deficit.Our claim is based on projected revenues and expenditures through fiscal year (FY) 2004.The revenue projection simply assumes that, without any major changes to the tax structure,general fund revenues will grow at the same rate as personal incomea rather generousassumption given recent growth rates and tax cuts. But this report focuses on expenditures andthe possible impact that a variety of trends may have on state spending during the next decade.Of course, no one knows for sure how fast technology will improve or whether the poverty ratewill increase or decrease. We cannot be certain that managed care will yield the expected savingsfor Kentucky's Medicaid system or that the prison population will continue to grow as rapidly asit has in the past. But we can make reasonable assumptions about how these things mightchange, and how they might affect expenditures.On the other hand, we assume the quality of state services will not change. In other words, thestate will not add new restrictions on Medicaid coverage, it will not increase or decrease policeprotection, it will continue to give its children as good an education as they receive today, etc. Weare essentially asking, \"With the changes taking place in society, the economy and the populace, Giertz, J.

Champaign-Urbana, IL: University of Illinois, Institute of Government and Public Affairs.267 256Exploring the Frontier of the Future how much money will Kentucky need to spend 10 years from now in order to give its citizens thesame quality of services they receive today?\" The answer is, \"More money than well have.\"Future Revenues and ExpendituresWe project expenditures to grow approximately 6 percent a year through FY2004, comparedto 5.3 percent annual growth for revenues. The difference may not seem like much, but at thisrate, expenditures would grow 79 percent between FY1994 and FY2004, while revenues wouldonly grow 67 percent. Even starting with a surplus in FY1994, we project that expenditures willexceed revenues by more than 4 percent in FY2004. This deficit will exist only in theory becausein practice spending will have to be less than revenue.Overall, general fund spending is growing faster than general fund revenue, but not allexpenditures are increasing at the same pace. If we divide state spending into functionalcategoriesprimary and secondary education, higher education, police and corrections, healthand human services, highways and all otherwe find that Kentucky's investment in education isgrowing slower than spending on prisons and health care: oIn our projections, health and human services spending experiences the sharpestincrease. We project this function's share of general fund revenues to rise from 18.3percent in FY1994 to more than 25 percent in FY2004.\u00a9Police and corrections spending rises from 5.3 percent of general fund revenues tomore than 6.5 percent.oPrimary and secondary education spending as a percentage of general fund revenuesis essentially unchanged.oHigher education's share of general fund revenues falls from 14.5 percent in FY1994to less than 13 percent in FY2004.\u00aeHighway spending is financed by the transportation fund, not the general fund, and sois not included in the forecast. But transportation fund revenue is nearly stagnant andreal spending is less than it was 20 years ago.\u00aeAll other spending slips from 12.6 to 12.1 percent of general fund revenues. 80%FIGURE 27.1Structural Deficit: Expenditure Projection, by Function50% -10%i I I I IPolice & Health & HigherPrim. & Sec.

Note the general fund \"deficit\" of 4.6 percent in FY2004. Weare not actually forecasting that Kentucky will have a deficit because it is prohibited by law.Rather, this shows that spending is growing at an unsustainable rate, given the current taxstructure and our assumptions about a variety of factors.Alternative ScenariosWe have already noted that the revenue and expenditure projections assume that the tax andspending structures will not change in the coming years. But what if we were to make a change?What if, for example, Kentucky decides that its spending for education is too low compared toother states and should be increased? Or what if the federal government changes its Medicaidfunding policy? Our budget model allows us to change a variety of factors which can createalternative budget scenarios. In this chapter, we explore four alternatives to our baseline forecast:An expanded commitment to higher educationAn expanded commitment to primary and secondary educationA change in federal Medicaid spendingA recessionThe budget projections based on these alternative scenarios do not pinpoint the exact amounts bywhich expenditures or revenues will change. Rather, they illustrate the magnitude of the impactthese events might have on the budget.The \"expanded commitment to higher education\" scenario includes a gradual increase in bothspending per student and college enrollments to meet the regional averages by FY2004. Ouranalysis suggests that spending for higher education would grow nearly 90 percent betweenFY1994 and FY2004, compared to a 50 percent increase in the baseline projection. The totaladditional cost of the expanded commitment to higher education could be more than $1' billionover 10 years. If spending for other functions is unchanged from the baseline levels, highereducation spending could exceed 16 percent of general fund revenues, and total spending for allcategories would then exceed revenues by more than 8 percent.In the \"expanded commitment to primary and secondary education\" scenario, we look at thecost of raising state and local expenditures per pupil to match the regional median. Evenassuming local governments bear their share of the increase, we project a huge additional cost$1.8 billion cumulativeand a deficit of more than 9 percent of general fund revenues inFY2004. In this scenario, spending for primary and secondary education is projected to grow 87percent between FY1994 and FY2004, compared to a baseline increase of 70 percent.One of the most contentious items of the federal budget debates of 1995 was Medicaid.Congress considered a variety of proposals to reduce federal spending over several years. One billwould have given Kentucky about $13.3 billion for Medicaid between FY1996 and FY2002. TheUrban Institute in Washington projected that this plan would have cut Kentucky's federalMedicaid revenues by about $4.3 billion between FY1996 and FY2002; Kentucky's Cabinet forHealth Services projected a reduction totaling about $3.4 billion. Our estimate is that the statewould lose roughly $700 million by FY2002 and $2 billion by FY2004. The Urban Institute andthe Cabinet for Health Services project gloomier scenarios than we do (because of differentassumptions about baseline spending), but even using our estimates, the state could have ageneral fund deficit of nearly 14 percent by FY2004, and health and human services spending271 $5.8 Billion and Change259 could amount to more than one-third of all general fund revenue, if we are to maintain thequality of services in the Medicaid program.We look at a recession scenario to demonstrate the importance of the rainy day fund. Thisfund supports state spending in lean years when slow economic growth leads to slow revenuegrowth. While our analysis projects expenditure growth to increase slightly during a recession(we chose 2002 as the year for the recession), it also projects revenue growth to slow to onlyabout 1 percent, compared to 5 percent growth in the baseline forecast. Instead of a baselinedeficit of 3 percent in FY2002, the slow revenue growth could create a deficit of more than 5percent.RecommendationsMany trends are largely outside the province of policymaking, particularly at the state level. IfKentucky is to maintainlet alone improvethe quality of services it currently provides, it mustbe proactive in managing the trends affecting spending. The state must develop and adoptstrategiesforstrengtheningitsfinancialoutlookinyearstocome. We offerfourrecommendations:Take stronger measures to ensure that the budget reserve fund is adequately fundedand adequately protected.Keep alive the spirit of the Governor's Commission on Quality and Efficiency bysearching for new ways to cut costs and improve efficiency.Be diligent in finding opportunities to improve our investment in the future througheducation.Ensure that our tax structure provides adequate revenues for state programs.Strengthen the Budget Reserve Fund. The current provisions for funding Kentucky's budgetreserve fund are rather weak; the reserves cannot exceed 5 percent of actual general fundreceipts, and any deposits made to the fund out of excess revenues are made after the stateimplements its surplus expenditure plan, if it so chooses. Protection of the reserve fund is evenweakerreserve funds may be appropriated at any time by the General Assembly. It's like savingmoney by putting it into your wallet instead of the bank. In the absence of a sound budget reservefund, the budget effects of a recession could be brutal.Keep Reform Alive.In its 1994 report, the Governor's Commission on Quality andEfficiency examined past budgets and noted that Kentucky has suffered budget shortfalls in 9 ofthe last 12 budget cycles and 4 of the last 7 years. In our report, we predict that budget shortfallswill continue to be a way of life, funds will not be available to make an expanded commitment toeducation, and a recession or a change in federal Medicaid policy would require severe spendingcuts. Whether the Commission studies the past or we gaze into the future, the conclusion is thesame: in the words of Jim Gray, chairman of the Commission, \"We must change the way wemanage our government.\"Improve and Invest in Education. Perhaps nowhere is innovation and increased efficiencymore urgent than in education. Compared to similar states, Kentucky spends less money perstudent at all levels of the education system. And while we are closing the spending gap at theprimary and secondary level, the gap in higher education spending is widening. The SouthernRegional Education Board reports that among 15 Southern states, Kentucky had the largestdecrease in education funding per college student over the last 10 years. We estimate thatKentucky would have to spend an additional $1 billion over the next decade just to match medianspending on higher education by our benchmark states.272 260Exploring the Frontier of the Future While it is beyond the scope of this report to examine possible education reforms in muchdetail, we will note that various experts have criticized the higher education system in Kentucky for duplication of services, \"turf fights,\" and lack of coordination, all of which decreaseefficiency. To increase efficiency, businesses and other private associations might share in thecosts and planning of higher education. And clearly, any substantial commitment of new stateresources to higher education must be accompanied by closer collaboration among institutionsand the different agencies responsible for post-secondary education.Change the State Tax Structure. As with education reform, we will not offer many specificrecommendations on tax policy. Others have done that for us. In a study by University ofKentucky professor William Hoyt, the extensive and detailed work of the Kentucky Commissionon Tax Policy, and the analysis of others who have looked at this issue, we have numerousrecommendations for changes in the state tax system.' (We should note that the Commission onTax Policy had no authority to enact any of the changes it recommended.) In the absence of taxreform, it seems clear that revenues will not keep pace with expenditures, and state services asthey now exist will be compromised. It is highly unlikely that Kentucky will be able to expand itscommitment to education (or, for that matter, other kinds of workforce training, economicdevelopment or environmental protection) if expenditures and revenues continue along theircurrent paths. 2 See Hoyt's chapter in this volume, and Kentucky Commission on Tax Policy. (1995). Final report. Frankfort, KY: Author. Trends in Civic Participation Voter participation in Kentucky lags behind the national average in recent elections for severalreasons, including income and education levels, lack of political competition and a political culture thattends to tolerate corrupt practices. The \"motor voter\" act has increased registration, and partycompetition is rising, but these trends may be negated by lack of citizen confidence in political actors andinstitutions. But voting is not the only means of participating in civic affairs. Many people donate time andmoney to charity, and they participate in school boards and other community organizations. Communitieswith such active, engaged citizens will enjoy a brighter future. As we look long term, one of the mostimportant challenges we face is that of providing effective citizenship education. By Paul BlanchardEastern Kentucky Universityn The Context of Change, the authors noted that voter participation in Kentucky has laggedwell behind the national average in recent elections.' This has been true of presidentialelections as well as elections at other levels. For example, in the highly significant election ofNovember 1994, when Kentucky Republicans captured two long-time Democratic congressionalseats, only 39 percent of eligible voters cast their ballots.' In the May primary elections in both1994 and 1995, voter turnout rates were even lower. And while voter turnout for the November1995 gubernatorial election exceeded expectations,' it was still far less than 50 percent.What are some of the reasons for low voter turnout and declining citizen participation inKentucky? My observations over the last 20 years lead me to conclude that, like citizens in otherstates, many Kentuckians have lost confidence in political leaders and political institutions. Theyreact unfavorably to negative campaigning, and they view elected officials as being unable and/orunwilling to fulfill the promises they make to voters. These perceptions are often inaccurate.Much evidence indicates that most politicians represent their constituents effectively and, to alarge extent, actually do what they have promised. But this does not diminish voter perceptions asdisincentives to participation.Other factors peculiar to Kentucky help explain our low levels of participation, especially incomparison to other states. As Jewell and Cunningham pointed out in their study of Kentuckypolitics in the late 1960s,4 voter turnout rates in our state have been below the national averagesince the 1930s. Much of this difference can be explained by Kentucky's relatively low incomeand education levels. We rank low in voter turnout, as do other poor states with high levels ofhigh school dropouts.But there are still other, more specific reasons why citizen participation in Kentucky has beenso low. \"Voter fatigue\" is one problem. In Kentucky, we expect citizens to vote twice every year,often for dozens of candidates running for a large number of apparently meaningless offices atboth the state and local levels. This situation tends to lower the interest level for any givenelection and depletes the \"political energy\" of average citizens who have limited time andresources to devote to researching candidates and issues. One encouraging development inKentucky is that, beginning in 1997, we will have one year during a four-year cycle (1997, 2001, I Smith-Mello, M. and Schirmer, P. (1994). The context of change.

Lexington, KY: University Press of Kentucky.274 262Exploring the Frontier of the Future 2005, etc.) when no elections will be held. But this is only one small step in eliminating theproblem of voter fatigue.Another contribution to low voter turnout is the lack of political competition in Kentucky.Even though Republicans do well in some elections, mainly for seats in the U.S. Senate and theHouse of Representatives, Kentucky has been and continues to be a Democratic-dominated statein most respects, especially at the local level. And while most Kentucky counties are dominatedby Democrats, a fairly substantial number are dominated by Republicans. Since local politics areso important to so many Kentuckians, lack of competition at this level is a significant deterrent toparticipation. Furthermore, one-party politics often means entrenched political organizations andissueless campaigns, which discourage participation even more.'A specific way that voter participation is discouraged in Kentucky is the limited time the polls are open on election dayfrom 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. This tends to create a hardship for those whowork long hours or commute long distances to work. Given the economic situation at the end ofthe 20th century, the number of people in these categories is increasing.Finally, Kentucky's political culture, which often tends to tolerate politically corruptpractices, from vote-buying to BOPTROT, leads to a pervasive sense of political cynicism inmany citizens and discourages them from all types of political participation. The reaction of aRichmond, Kentucky, citizen, quoted in a recent Courier-Journal story on low turnout, is typicalDon Katzman said he hasn't voted in more than 30 years, primarily because the last time he wentto the polls he left disgusted. \"I saw votes being bought, and it just seemed to me that whoeverhad the money to do that was always going to win.\"6Is Katzman's cynical attitude toward politics shared by others across the United States? Muchhas been written in recent years about the alienation and cynicism of Americans. In his well-known and important 1991 book, Why Americans Hate Politics, journalist E.J. Dionne argued that politicians and political parties in the United States have often presented Americans withfalse choices, based on outdated issues. This has resulted in what Dionne saw as legitimate anger,especially among middle-class citizens.'Just how angry Americans are in 1996, and how that anger affects their willingness to vote,as well as to participate in other civic activities, is currently the subject of some disagreementamong scholars and journalists. In an influential 1996 book by Susan J. Tolchin, The AngryAmerican: How Voter Rage is Changing the Nation, the author discusses how economic changes, particularly those related to globalization, have \". .. engendered a new form of anger that relatesto the public's feelings of injustice, betrayal and blame.\"' But presidential candidates Bob Doleand Ross Perot, who should have been able to take advantage of voter anger this intense, havebeen generally unsuccessful. When asked what happened to all the anger, one of Perot's pollstersresponded, \"Down about 20 points.\" Asked why, he responded, \"The anger's been absorbed by an unrelentingly favorable economy.\" A Republican pollster, Frank Luntz, saw itslightly differently: \"They're still angry but not spitting mad anymore. They're just not very interested.They got sick of politics a year ago, during the budget battle, and tuned out.\"9.. Results from the 1996 elections in Kentucky reflect this rather ambivalent attitude towardpolitical participation on the part of Kentuckians. The low voter turnout (58 percent of registered voters; 47 percent of voting age populationboth lower than in 1992) can be interpreted in a number of ways. If Kentuckians were angry, their anger was not directed toward the president,who carried the state, albeit by a narrow margin. Nor was it directed toward incumbent membersof Congress (except for the defeat of incumbent Democrat Mike Ward, who barely won in 1992),or Republicans. We cannot even conclude that the substantial numbers of Kentuckians who chose 5 Several of these issues are discussed in Blanchard, P. (1984). Political parties and elections. In J.

After all, one of the fewstudies of Kentucky non-voters described these individuals as active members of theircommunities: ...they tend to be involved in the communities and activities closest to their liveschurch groups, school committees, even community organizations . .. When they investtime, money, and energy in organizations and activities closest to their everyday lives,they feel the returns are palpable and sense that they can concretely affect the course ofactions that shape those policies and distribute those rewards.'We will return to this discussion of the relationship between voting and other forms of politicalparticipation later in this essay.Given Kentucky's rather dismal track record of citizen participation, especially in terms ofvoting behavior, what can we project regarding future trends in this area? Are they likely to bepositive, with increasing and more meaningful citizen participation, or negative, with \"more ofthe same\" or even declining, in terms of citizen involvement? As is so often the case, the answerincludes both good news and bad news.Much of the good news can be summarized in two words: \"motor voter.\" Kentucky is one ofthe first states to have implemented the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA),sponsored by Kentucky Senator Wendell Ford. NVRA is often referred to as the motor voter lawbecause it allows citizens to register to vote (almost automatically) when they renew their driver'slicenses. However, citizens can also register easily at convenient locations when attending toother routine governmental matters, such as applying for AFDC, food stamps, or Medicaid.NVRA has contributed significantly to a hefty increase in the number of registered voters inKentuaky. More people registered to vote in 1995 (nearly 200,000) than ever before, andKentucky set a record in November 1995, with nearly 2.25 million registered voters.\" In terms ofenhancing citizen participation, this increase is encouraging and significant, since failure toregister is almost always one of the main reasons non-voters give for their decision not to vote. Ifcurrent trends continue, and we expect they will, almost all Kentuckians will be registered to votewithin just a few years.Unfortunately, there are discouraging trends which result from examining the voter turnoutamong motor voter registrants. During the May 1995 primary, only 7 percent of them voted! Thisrate improved to about 18 percent in the general elections, but this was far below the statewideturnout of 44 percent. Further, turnout rates among certain categories of motor voter registrantswere even lower, for example, 9 percent among AFDC clients, 10 percent for food stamprecipients, and 10 percent for Medicaid applicants.12 Clearly, overcoming the registration barrieris much easier than getting people to actually vote.Another positive trend affecting citizen participation is the increasing level of partycompetition in Kentucky which has been generated by a stronger and more competitiveRepublican party. Examples of this include the 1st and 2nd Congressional District victories,mentioned earlier, more Republicans in the General Assembly, especially the State Senate, thevery narrow loss by Republican Larry Forgy in the 1995 gubernatorial election, and several localRepublican victories across the state in traditionally strong Democratic areas. Political scienceresearch strongly suggests that there is a high correlation between party competition and voterturnout. Kentucky's recent past, most notably the turnout in November 1995, supports suchconclusions.Potentially, the most discouraging trend in the area of civic participation is the increasinglack of citizen confidence in political actors and institutions. How we deal with this problem will l\u00b0 Yanarella, E. (1992).None of the above: Alienated citizens talk back.

Comparable data for 19% were not available as this essay was drafted.276 264Exploring the Frontier of the Future be critical to a healthy polity in the 21st century. Many of the suggestions for addressing thisproblem have revolved around attempts to \"reconnect\" citizens to their governments and to theircommunities. A national effort in this direction was spearheaded by a group known as ProjectDemocracy, the National Commission for the Renewal of American Democracy. This group,made up largely of secretaries of state from around the country, worked for about four years(1992-1995). Their work culminated in September 1995, when their final report, accompanied bya workbook and an \"idea book,\" were released nationally at a Citizens Participation Conferenceheld at Eastern Kentucky University. Both the workbook and the idea book contain a wealth ofideas and strategies for more fully engaging citizens in the political process. Unfortunately, fewindividuals or groups have emerged to lead in the attempt to implement these ideas. One notableexception is the League of Women Voters of Kentucky.During the September 1995 Citizens Participation Conference at EKU, conferenceparticipants (nearly 150) were given opportunities to suggest ways to engage citizens moreeffectively in their communities and in the political process. While hundreds of thoughtful andinnovative ideas were suggested, those which seemed to be most meaningful and to have thegreatest potential for success were in the area of citizenship education. As Michal Smith-Mello(the conference keynote speaker) has written recently:Voter education is also key. The interest of everyday citizens in the details of policyoptions, budgets, and program outcomes has historically been underestimated. People arehungry for information and part of the challenge government faces is to make it broadlyaccessible in a range of formats, from town meetings to the Internet. Indeed, gatheringand disseminating the information citizens need to make informed and thoughtfuldecisions is becoming a key government role.\"Conference participantspointed out thatwhile citizenshipeducationisan importantresponsibility of elementary and secondary schools, this process is lifelong, and communities andcommunity organizations must share in the responsibility for providing it.Thus, one of the most important questions as we look at trends in civic participation inKentucky at the end of the 20th century is: How effectively are schools and communities inKentucky providing the kind of citizenship education that will produce active and engagedcitizens? While the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) seems to place a high priority onoutcomes and activitiesthat relateto \"citizenship education,\" even the most informedKentuckians are confused about what our schools are doing in this area. Greater discussionamong educators, political leaders, parents, and other citizens is urgently needed to provide moreinformation and clarity about what our schools are doing to produce more knowledgeable andeffective citizens.One organization that is addressing both of these concernscitizenship education anddeclining confidence in the political processis Kids Voting Kentucky. This program, whichprovides curriculum activities for students at all grade levels, has as a culminating activity theopportunity for students to vote on election day (on unofficial ballots) at the same votingprecincts as their parents. Impressive results have been achieved, not only in increasingenthusiasm among school children but also in providing motivation for parents to participate. Anencouraging trend in Kentucky is that Kids Voting, which began in Fayette County, is expandingin 1996 into five other countiesBourbon, Clark, Harrison, Jefferson, and Woodford.'As noted earlier, the topic of civic participation involves more than just voting. The two arenot synonymous. We know that some citizens who choose not to vote do engage in othermeaningful civic activities. What can we say about trends in these other forms of participation?At the national level, there is substantial disagreement about whether levels of civic and 13 Smith-Mello, M. Community, trust key to our economic and social future.14 Information about Kids Voting Kentucky is available from its Executive Director, Marilyn Carter, at PO Box 1108,Lexington, KY 40589-1108.2 77 Trends in Civic Participation 265 community engagement, often referred to as \"social capital,\" are rising or falling. Harvardprofessor Robert Putnam, author of a very influential book on this topic, Making DemocracyWork,'5 has cited substantial evidence to suggest that social capital in America is declining. Hehas pointed to decreasing numbers of Americans who attend meetings on civic matters, whowork for a political party, who serve on a committee of a local organization, or who attendpolitical rallies:By almost every measure, Americans' direct engagement in politics and government hasfallen steadily and sharply over the last generation, despite the fact that average levels ofeducationthe best individual-level predictor of political participationhave risensharply throughout this period. Every year over the last decade or two, millions morehave withdrawn from the affairs of their communities.'6Putnam's pessimistic conclusions have been challenged, most notably by Everett C. Ladd,long-time director of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research at the University ofConnecticut. The Roper Center devoted 35 pages of its June/July 1996 magazine, The PublicPerspective, to the topic: \"A Vast Empirical Record Refutes the Idea of Civic Decline.\" Inresponse to the Putnam quote cited above, Ladd wrote: \"The data just don't show erosion ofAmerica's 'social capital.'\" Data are cited to show that Americans are volunteering more timeand money to worthy causes, are more likely than earlier to contact local officials, and aremaking campaign contributions in increasing numbers. In addition, increases were reported inAmericans who have written to their member of Congress, who work with others on communityneeds, and who formed groups to help solve local problems.What trends do we see in Kentucky relative to this academic debate about whether socialcapital is rising or falling? The little evidence that is available supports a fairly positiveperspective. For example, the results of a recent statewide survey suggest that Kentuckians aremore trusting and more engaged in the life of their communities than most Americans. Socialcapital cannot develop without high levels of trust, and a higher level of trust seems to existamong Kentuckians than among their counterparts in other states. The survey also revealed that,compared to other Americans, more Kentuckians participate in civic, community, charitable, orchurch-related activities.\"In commenting on these findings and their relationship to the national debate about socialcapital, Michael Childress, Executive Director of the Kentucky Long-Term Policy ResearchCenter, made this observation:The high levels of trust these survey results show are undoubtedly related to cur strongsense of neighborliness in Kentucky. Today, research has offered us plentiful andconvincing empirical evidence to demonstrate both a decline and an increase in socialcapital in the United States. What we're interested in learning about at the Center is themore important question of how social capital is formed and how it contributes to thedevelopment of communities.\"In seeking answers to this \"more important question,\" an excellent place to begin is inOwsley County, where a citizens' group, the Owsley County Action Team, was formed in 1992.Its mission is \"to provide leadership to enable citizens to achieve self-empowerment, sustainablecommunity development, and an enriched quality of life.\" The Owsley County Action Team isworking with the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development (MACED) of 15 Putnam, R.D. (1993).Making democracy work.Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.16 Putnam, R. D. (1995, January). Bowling alone: America's declining social capital. Journal of Democracy,6, 67.17 The survey was commissioned by the Kentucky Long-Term Policy Research Center ( KLTPRC) and conducted by theUniversity of Kentucky Survey Research Center. The findings are reported in a KLTPRC news release dated August 1, 1996.18 KLTPRC news release cited above.278 266Exploring the Frontier of the Future Berea and its Sustainable Communities Initiative. According to Jeanne Gage, Director of theSustainable Communities Initiative, a \"sustainable community\" is: ...a thriving community, one which will prosper over the long term. Sustainablecommunities have developed the basic relationships necessary to bring individuals andorganizationstogethertounderstand and respond tochallenges and explorepossibilities.'9Several of the principles upon which the Sustainable Communities Initiative is based areapplicable to the development of social capital and the encouragement of greater citizenparticipation.Gage has written that sustainable communities share these characteristics:They build relationships among people, organizations, and institutions. To developtrust, respect and networks for ideas, there must be strong relationships amongpeople, organizations and institutions. These relationships cannot be bought orrecruited from the outside; they are created through involvement in local governmentand community and civic groups.They cooperate for the common good. The ability and willingness of a group ofpeople to come together to solve public problems is key to building sustainablecommunities. Communities must learn to use information networks, relationships,trust and skills to achieve what is best for the whole community.They create opportunities for community learning. Public spaces such as communitycenters, libraries, schools, farmers' markets, general stores, coffee shops, and parksare necessary to encourage the regular coming together of citizens and organizationsto discuss public issues, learn, share concerns, make plans and have fun. Computernetworks and local newspapers can serve as public spaces to encourage communityconversations on issues.\"Early results from Owsley County are encouraging. When asked about why an Owsley CountyAction Team was formed in the first place, Jeanette Rogers, Director of Community Developmentfor the group, said, \"We got tired of being helped and decided it was time to help ourselves.\"And help themselves they have. Over the past four years, the Owsley County group started aGoat Producers Association, a Vegetable Producers Association, and an education foundationcalled the Owsley County Fund for Excellence. It has also revived the Booneville/Owsley CountyIndustrial Authority, assisted in funding a downtown development office which is currentlyestablishing a Chamber of Commerce, and is working on establishing a Business MentoringNetwork.These accomplishments are impressive and suggest that Owsley Countians have found asuccessful approach to developing civic capital and more involved citizens. If this trend of\"sustainable communities\" catches on in cities and towns across our state, the future of civicparticipation in Kentucky will be bright indeed. 19 This and other information about the Owsley County Action Team was provided to the writer by Jeanne Gage.
