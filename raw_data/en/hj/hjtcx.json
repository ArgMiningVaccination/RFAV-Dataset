We are very proud of the achievements of our clinicians, physician- investigators and scientists. The work highlighted here illustrates that, in spite of enormous stress on our faculty in the past few years, our faculty performed admirably. This compendium demonstrates the depth, breadth and rigor of the scientific contributions into pathobiology, treatment, prevention and cures for childhood diseases. It really is a testimony of the spectacular quality of the research that goes on in the hallways of UC San Diego and Rady Children's Hospital. This is an exciting time as we continue to grow and adapt to a changing world, remaining motivated and responsive to improving clinical care through research and discoveries. The reason for hope is related to both the superlative quality of clinical care at RCHSD and the outstanding basic and clinical research taking place in our research buildings into the late night, day after day. We hope that this summary of faculty discoveries helps to facilitate potential collaborations between clinicians, clinician-investigators and scientists around the world. We trust that such collaborations and networking can bring investigators closer to curing diseases of childhood and hence building a better society for the future. This is so much the responsibility of pediatricians across the world. Gabriel G. Haddad, MD GABRIEL G.

Bacteria within our oral and respiratory cavities, and within our built environment may have an important influence on respiratory virus abundance and viability. The laboratory of Dr. Gilbert has led the analysis of the microbiome of the built environment, which in the developed world consists predominantly of human skin, gut, oral and respiratory tract-associated bacteria. Previous studies including dense spatial and temporal sampling and microbiome analysis of the hospital environment has demonstrated that the hospital environment is selecting for a limited set of bacteria that can survive and persist on the floors and surfaces in the building - which primarily originate from the respiratory tract. Bacteria can alter the survival of viruses outside the host by enhancing stability of the capsid, and direct interaction between bacteria and viruses can impact viral transmission in mouse models. Considered together, these data suggest an intricate feedback loop in which viral-bacterial interactions, in hospital air and on surfaces, and within respiratory mucosa, are influenced by each other to impact viral persistence and potential virulence. Recently, Dr Gilbert's team, led by Dr Sarah Allard in collaboration with Dr. Rob Knight's team performed a survey of patient- and ICU-surface-associated microbiome during hospitalization events for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This study demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 closely associated with the abundance of the oral and respiratory associated bacterium, Rothia denticarosa, both in the patient (oral, nasal, and fecal samples) and on surfaces in the patient's room, especially the floors. This finding was independently validated by a group at another university. We are now investigating how SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory bacteria (including Rothia) interact and have found that the SARS SPIKE protein binds to the outside of many different types of bacteria (Fig. 1). IMPLICATION : Broader sampling and experimentation are required to understand the extent to which Rothia influences the viability and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. We are currently performing studies to identify whether Rothia influences viral persistence and viability on different surface materials and to determine the mechanisms underpinning the viral-bacterial conjugate. The implication of this work is that definition of factors that impact SARS-CoV-2 abundance and viability and infectivity will enable the design of appropriate interventions and treatments to limit viral transmission and establishment of secondary bacterial infections.

The ability to rapidly predict SaB patient responses and guide personalized treatment regimens could reduce mortality. Dr. Gonzalez and his team present a resource of SaB prognostic biomarkers. Integrating proteomic and metabolomic techniques enabled the identification of >10,000 features from >200 serum samples collected upon clinical presentation. They interrogated the complexity of serum using multiple computational strategies, which provided a comprehensive view of the early host response to infection. Their biomarkers exceed the predictive capabilities of those previously reported, particularly when used in combination. Last, the Gonzalez team validated the biological contribution of mortality-associated pathways using a murine model of SaB. Their findings represent a starting point for the development of a prognostic test for identifying high-risk patients at a time early enough to trigger intensive monitoring and interventions. IMPLICATION : This finding is a leap forward toward a point- of-care predictive tool for SaB risk. Further refinement of SaB biomarkers will enable clinicians to identify patients who need intensified monitoring and therapy, rather than responding post hoc to failures in standard of care.

FIGURE. 1 [ 6 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 7 ] The translational power of human microbiome studies is limited by high interindividual variation. Dr. Knight and his team describe a dimensionality reduction tool, compositional tensor factorization (CTF), that incorporates information from the same host across multiple samples to reveal patterns driving differences in microbial composition across phenotypes. CTF identifies robust patterns in sparse compositional datasets, allowing for the detection of microbial changes associated with specific phenotypes that are reproducible across datasets. IMPLICATION : In this work and in follow-up studies (Song et al. 2021 Med, Marotz et al. 2021 mSystems, Martino et al. preprint BioRxiv), the Knight lab discovered that this improved method for revealing timeseries signals in microbiome data can explain how early-life changes in the microbiome predict Compositional Tensor Factorization CTF utilizes feature abundance matrices for subjects over time. For each subject with a phenotype of interest, the data is represented as relative abundances of features (abundance gradient represented in grayscale) over time. (b) The matrices are concatenated, robust-centered log-ratio transformed (R-CLR) and structured into a tensor format with modes corresponding to subjects, features and time. (c) The resulting tensor is then factored based only on observed data into loading vectors for each dimension (i.e. subject, timepoint, and feature). (d) Simulated count data is plotted on the y-axis for three taxa with the mean counts in bold and missing values absent from the bold line. Standard deviation of distributions are shaded behind. Two phenotypes are compared; a control unchanging in time (left) and a dynamic phenotype with a perturbation at time point 2 (right). Taxon 1 (blue) is highly abundant and noisy, taxon 2 (red) is lowly abundant but growing exponentially in phenotype 2, and taxon 3 (orange) is oscillatory with increasing amplitude in phenotype 2. The first two principal component axes (i.e. loadings) from CTF (PC1 (top) and PC2 (bottom)) are plotted on the y-axis with the corresponding sample (e), time (f), and feature loadings (g). In PC1, phenotype 2 is linked to the unstable oscillatory waveform of highly loaded taxon 3 (orange, top). Similarly, in PC2, phenotype 2 is linked to the sigmoidal waveform of highly loaded taxon 2 (red, bottom).FIGURE. 1 inflammatory bowel disease and possibly other conditions later in life, and how bacteria interact with SARS-CoV-2 in patients and hospital environments relevant to COVID.

Following recent demonstrations that some types of cancer show substantial microbial contributions, the Knight lab re-examined whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing studies in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of 33 types of cancer from treatment-naive patients (a total of 18,116 samples) for microbial reads, and found unique microbial signatures in tissue and blood within and between most major types of cancer. These TCGA blood signatures remained predictive when applied to patients with stage Ia-IIc cancer and cancers lacking any genomic alterations currently measured on two commercial-grade cell-free tumour DNA platforms, despite the use of very stringent decontamination analyses that discarded up to 92.3% of total sequence data.

Epub 2020 11.[ 8 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 9 ] Hundreds of genes are implicated in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but the mechanisms through which they contribute to ASD pathophysiology remain elusive. Dr. Lewis and his team analyzed leukocyte transcriptomics from 1- to 4-year-old male toddlers with ASD or typical development from the general population. They discovered a perturbed gene network that includes highly expressed genes during fetal brain development. This network is dysregulated in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuron models of ASD. High-confidence ASD risk genes emerge as upstream regulators of the network, and many risk genes may impact the network by modulating RAS-ERK, PI3K-AKT and WNT-\u00df-catenin signaling pathways. Dr. Lewis and his team found that the degree of dysregulation in this network correlated with the severity of ASD symptoms in the toddlers. IMPLICATION : By finding core molecular pathways involved in the dysregulated brain development in autism, Dr. Lewis and his team are now a few steps closer to understanding the molecular, genetic, and developmental basis of the disorder. This opens up more opportunities for therapies and interventions. Furthermore, by analyzing the activity of these pathways in blood samples, they found that one can diagnose ASD children as young as 18 months old and predict the severity of their symptoms that may not present clearly for a few years. Thus, therapies can begin at a younger age when they can be more effective.

FIGURE. 1 Transcriptome analysis of 226 toddlers with ASD or TD identified 1,236 DE genes. A comprehensive 'static' network of DE genes was built from high-confidence physical and regulatory interactions from interaction databases. To identify transcriptional programs that are active in each diagnosis group, pairs of interacting genes were retained in the static network that are highly coexpressed in each diagnosis group. This yielded networks that were specific to children with autism (DE-ASD) and typically developing children (DE-TD), allowing for a comparison of the activity of transcriptional programs between ASD and TD conditions. To connect the DE-ASD network to rASD genes, an XP-ASD network was built by connecting the DE-ASD network to autism risk gene (rASD). The DE-ASD and XP-ASD networks were analyzed in the context of neural differentiation, ASD neuron models and ASD symptom severity. To ensure results were robust to variations in the interaction networks, the results were reproduced by replacing the high-confidence static network (the first step in pipeline) with a functional and a full coexpression network.

However, the contribution of intermittent hypoxia (IH) or intermittent hypercapnia (IC) in promoting atherosclerosis remains unclear. Since gut microbiota and metabolites have been implicated in atherosclerosis, Dr. Haddad and his team examined whether IH or IC alters the microbiome and metabolome to induce a pro-atherosclerotic state. Apolipoprotein E deficient mice (ApoE-/- ), treated with IH or IC on a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10 weeks, were compared to Air controls. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined, gut microbiome was profiled using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and metabolome was spectrometry. the aorta, IC-induced atherosclerosis was significantly greater than IH and Air IC 11.1 \u00b1 0.7% vs. IH 7.6 \u00b1 0.4%, p < 0.05 vs. Air 8.1 \u00b1 0.8%, p < 0.05). In the pulmonary artery (PA), however, IH, IC, and Air were significantly different from each other in atherosclerotic formation with the largest lesion observed under IH 40.9 \u00b1 vs. 12.2 1.5%, p < 0.05). The most differentially abundant microbial families (p < 0.001) were Peptostreptococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae. most were tauro-\u00df-muricholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and lysophosphoethanolamine (18:0). It was concluded that IH and IC (a) modulate atherosclerosis progression differently in distinct vascular beds with IC, unlike IH, facilitating atherosclerosis in both aorta and PA and (b) promote an atherosclerotic luminal gut environment that is more evident in IH than IC. We speculate that the resulting changes in the gut metabolome and microbiome interact differently with distinct vascular beds. IMPLICATION : This work has major clinical implications since IH and IHC can change the gut microbiome, which can contribute to increased risk for atherosclerosis. Understanding which deleterious bacterial ecology is important and how the host interacts with gut bacteria to produce a certain gut metabolome will be important for devising innovation for better cardiovascular therapy of OSA.

FIGURE. 1 Advances in acne pathogenesis have been modest over the years because available animal models do not approximate human disease. The pathogen that causes acne vulgaris, C. acnes, is rapidly killed by laboratory animals upon subcutaneous introduction and, therefore, current models do not mimic what occurs in human disease. Dr. Liu and his team applied a synthetic human sebum to the mouse skin at the time of C. acnes inoculation and noted dramatic and sustained survival of C. acnes along with induction of inflammatory lesions. Furthermore acne-associated C. acnes strains induced lesions that are consistently more inflammatory than lesions caused by health-associated C. acnes strains. Therefore, this new model represents a promising platform to study the pathogenesis and treatment of acne vulgaris. IMPLICATION : Current therapeutics for acne vulgaris are modestly effective, non-specific, and require prolonged application. By generating an acne model that approximates human disease, the Liu lab is in a unique position to investigate human-relevant mechanisms of acne disease and treatment.

Despite antibiotics and improvements in ICU care, Staphylococcus aureus (staph) bloodstream infection and sepsis still causes severe illness or death in 20% of patients. Dr. Nizet and his team discovered a battle that occurs between staph bacteria and platelets \u2014 blood cells known better for their role in clotting than in immune defense. In some sepsis cases, they found, the bacteria win out and platelet levels plummet, and those patients with fewer platelets were more likely to die of staph sepsis. Platelets secrete antimicrobial peptides that help the immune system destroy staph. At the same time, staph release a toxin that's that pokes holes in platelets and causes them to produce an enzyme that trims off sugar molecules that decorate their own surfaces. The platelet's new look is recognized by another molecule in the liver called the Ashwell-Morell receptor, which pulls \"bald\" platelets out of circulation. To tip the balance of the \"toxin-platelet-receptor\" axis back in favor of the human patient, the Nizet lab performed studies in a mouse model of staph sepsis, testing several classes of drugs known to be safe in humans and known to act on platelets. Most drugs they tested had no effect, but two drugs made a big difference. Ticagrelor (Brilinta\u00ae) blocks staph's toxin so it can't injure platelets enzyme. Oseltamivir (Tamflu\u00ae) inhibits the platelet sugar-removing enzyme so the cells don't go bald and aren't cleared by the liver. Mice with staph sepsis and treated with either ticagrelor or oseltamivir maintained more platelets and had less bacteria in their blood. Ultimately, 60% percent of treated mice survived compared to 20% of untreated mice. IMPLICATION : Discovering a new drug is tremendously expensive and takes many, many years. But by looking around at what is already available, what is already known to be safe, there may be many opportunities to improve patient outcomes. Rather than continue to throw more antibiotics at the problem, there is the option to boost the other side of the equation: the patient's own immune system.

Members of this group include the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica, as well as Escherichia coli, a species that comprises myriad commensals, pathobionts, and pathogens. Both Salmonella and E. coli can colonize the intestine of mammals and thrive in inflammatory conditions. The laboratory of Dr. Raffatellu has previously discovered that, in response to zinc limitation, the gut pathogen Salmonella overcomes zinc sequestration by the host protein calprotectin, outcompetes the microbiota, and colonizes the gut to high levels. In addition to Salmonella, other Enterobacteriaceae can thrive in the inflamed intestine. One such example is the probiotic bacterium Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (E. coli Nissle), a strain that was first isolated in WWI from the stool of a soldier who did not develop gastroenteritis during a Shigella outbreak. Since then, E. coli Nissle has proven to be effective in the treatment and prevention of intestinal disorders including chronic constipation, ulcerative colitis, and infantile diarrhea. Recently, Dr. Raffatellu's team discovered the mechanisms by which E. coli Nissle acquires zinc in the inflamed gut and, in close collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Pieter Dorrestein, identified the zinc-scavenging molecule. The team discovered that a small molecule secreted by E. coli Nissle (yersiniabactin) is capable of binding zinc and thus acts as a zincophore, delivering zinc to the bacterium. Moreover, the group demonstrated that E. coli Nissle utilizes yersiniabactin, in addition to other zinc transporters, to effectively acquire zinc in vitro, to resist the antimicrobial activity of calprotectin, and to colonize the inflamed gut. IMPLICATION : Dr. Raffatellu's studies elucidating how commensal and pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae thrive in the inflamed gut by acquiring essential metal nutrients have implication for developing new therapies to combat gastrointestinal infections while promoting the growth of beneficial microbes.

Using animal models of disease and in vivo RNA-sequencing analysis, Dr. Rivera-Chavez and his team found that the catalytic activity of CT induces metabolic changes in the gut, leading to enhanced growth of V. cholerae during infection. However, the molecular mechanisms by which CT promotes transmission of the pathogen remain poorly understood. The Rivera-Chavez lab continues to its research to further understand how CT-induced disease modulates host intestinal metabolism to enhance the transmission of V. cholerae. They are currently investigating whether CT may modulate the intestinal microbiota to promote fecal-oral transmission of V. cholerae. This research will continue the in-depth characterization of CT and other PKA-activating toxins in the modulation of host metabolism, the intestinal microbiota, pathogen growth, and transmission. These findings will have broad implications for how CT and other bacterial toxins modulate host metabolism and pathogen growth, which could lead to novel therapeutics and intervention strategies. IMPLICATION : There are an estimated 100,000 to 120,000 deaths every year due to cholera, with about half of all cholera deaths occurring in children under five. Due to the lack of cost-effective vaccination and poor vaccine efficacy in children, there is a need for alternative preventative and therapeutic strategies. These findings represent a paradigm shift into our understanding of the function of cholera toxin and likely other bacterial toxins in the transmission of bacterial pathogens, which may point to both host and bacterial metabolism as new targets for the treatment or prevention of cholera and other infectious diseases.

FIGURE. 1 14 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 15 ] FIGURE. 1 The two major roadblocks to an HIV-1 cure are: 1. identification and elimination of HIV-1 from latent reservoirs that persist despite highly successful suppressive therapy; and 2. the identification and killing of all cells that express HIV-1 on the surface to prevent the new infection of neighboring cells. To address the first challenge, Drs. Grant Campbell and Spector hypothesized that HIV-1 maintains the survival of latently infected CD4+ T cells through increased expression of cell survival factors including XIAP, BIRC2 and BECN1. They found that SMAC mimetics promote the degradation of XIAP and BIRC2 in latent HIV-infected resting memory CD4+ T cells (HIV-TCM) without activating viral transcription. Also in HIV-TCM, but not uninfected cells, degradation of XIAP and BIRC2 leads to induction of autophagy, and the formation of a cell death complex on phagophore membranes that results in killing of HIV-TCM while sparing uninfected cells (Fig 1). To address the second obstacle, Dr. Spector's laboratory in collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Liangfang Zhang of bioengineering examined the potential of nanoengineered CD4+ T cell membrane-coated nanoparticles (TNP) to neutralize a broad range of HIV-1 strains. They found that TNP display outstanding neutralizing breadth and potency, and are able to neutralize all 125 HIV-1 viral strains from a global panel of HIV-1 subtypes and recombinant forms (Fig 2). TNP also selectively bind and kill HIV-1 infected CD4+ T cells and macrophages while having no effect on uninfected cells. IMPLICATION : These findings show that certain SMAC mimetics can selectively kill HIV-1 latently infected cells. Moreover, TNP can be used to neutralize HIV-1 and to target cells expressing HIV-1 proteins on the surface. Thus, Dr. Spector and colleagues have developed a drug delivery platform that can be combined with small molecules including SMAC mimetics to target and preferentially kill HIV-infected replicating and latently infected cells.

In Western diets, red meat is a frequently eaten food, but long-term consumption has been associated with increased risk of disease. Red meat is enriched in N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) that cannot be synthesized by humans. However, consumption can cause Neu5Gc incorporation into cell surface glycans, especially in carcinomas. As a consequence, an inflammatory response is triggered when Neu5Gc-containing glycans encounter circulating anti-Neu5Gc antibodies. Although bacteria can use free sialic acids as a nutrient source, it was until recently unknown if gut microorganisms contribute to releasing Neu5Gc from food. Dr. Zengler and his team found that a Neu5Gc-rich diet induces changes in the gut microbiota, and that these changes included an increased abundance of novel sialidases. They identified these bacterial sialidases with previously unobserved substrate preference for Neu5Gc-containing glycans.

In absence of sialidases, Neu5Gc is incorporated into human tissue triggering xenosialitis. In the presence of bacterial sialidases, Neu5Gc is released from red meat glycoproteins and metabolized by bacteria or NO in/uniFB02ammation \u0003 \u0005\u0016 contributing to this substrate preference. Furthermore, they verified that these sialidases were able to release Neu5Gc from red meat. The release of Neu5Gc from red meat using bacterial sialidases could reduce the risk of inflammatory diseases associated with red meat consumption, including colorectal cancer and atherosclerosis. IMPLICATION : This finding could provide a path forward to systematically reduce inflammation in the gut. Optimization of these new enzymes would increase release of Neu5Gc from the diet thus reducing its inflammatory properties.

The CBNP facilitated access to complex neuro-oncology care for underserved children in Mexico through binational exchanges of resources and expertise. Five-year overall survival dramatically improved from 0% before 2010 to 52% in 2017. The CBNP model offers an attractive alternative for children with brain tumors in low-and-middle income countries who require complex neuro-oncology care, particularly those in close proximity to institutions in high-income countries with extensive neuro-oncology expertise, such as Rady Children's Hospital. IMPLICATION : The Cross-Border Neuro-Oncology Program was established across the United States-Mexico border to facilitate access to neuro-oncology care for children with brain tumors in Tijuana, Mexico, through binational exchanges of resources and expertise. The cross-border model improved survival significantly and serves as a feasible model for other border regions across the world.

The immune system plays a critical role in controlling the development of tumors and harnessing its innate ability to eliminate cancer has received much attention in recent times. CD8+ cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) are vital components of anti- tumor immunity. Dr. Ganesan and her team discovered that a distinct subset of CD8+ CTLs, the tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells, were most important in mediating robust anti-tumor immune responses and their presence within tumors correlated with improved survival in patients. However, they observed that only a subset of patients mounted a CD8+ TRM cell response. Therefore, it was imperative to understand what signals triggered TRM generation and persistence in these patients. To address this question, Dr. Ganesan and her team undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the key immune cell types in the tumor microenvironment (TME) to understand how they modulated TRM responses. They generated the transcriptional profiles of patient-matched, purified tumor-infiltrating immune cells from patients to define the molecular interactions between them. Dr. Ganesan found that a follicular helper T cell (TFH) program in CD4+ T cells was strongly associated with CD8+ TRM responses. She performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis to characterize this unique TFH-like cell subset and found that they possessed the ability to be cytotoxic and to provide 'help' to CD8+ TRM cells. Tumor-infiltrating TFH-like cells expressed PD-1 and were enriched in tumors following checkpoint blockade, suggesting that they may respond to anti-PD-1 therapy. Adoptive transfer or induction of TFH cells in mouse tumor models resulted in augmented CD8+ CTL responses and impairment of tumor growth in vivo, indicating an important role of TFH-like CD4+ T cells in supporting TRM responses and anti-tumor immunity. IMPLICATION : From these studies, Dr. Ganesan and her team have discovered a number of novel molecular targets to bolster CD8+ TRM and CD4+ TFH-like responses which are likely to mediate tumor clearance. They are undertaking studies for functional validation of these targets to translate this knowledge for the design personalized immunotherapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.

In collaboration with Diane Masser-Frye and with the support of the St. Baldrick's Infrastructure Grant, Dennis Kuo started the Cancer Genetics Clinic at Rady Children's Hospital to provide care and cancer surveillance for children, adolescents and young adults with genetic cancer predispositions. Two of the research initiatives that developed from this program explore the challenges in testing for cancer predispositions in the pediatric oncology population. In their screening protocol where cancer predisposition testing was broadly offered to pediatric oncology patients and patients and parents were surveyed about their knowledge and attitudes, there was overwhelming interest. Parents felt very strongly that they wanted as much information as possible about such predispositions. Furthermore, the interest in testing was similarly highly held among both the patients and the participants. However, while screening universally for cancer predispositions in the pediatric oncology population has some advantages and appeal, such an approach results in a high prevalence of incidental findings, variants of unknown significance, and potential unintended consequences and stresses. In the interest of better understanding how to direct clinicians towards the most appropriate candidates for cancer predisposition screening, Dr. Kuo and his team conducted a retrospective study applying the McGill Interactive Pediatric OncoGenetic Guidelines (MIPOGG) algorithms to their cancer survivorship population. In this study of family cancer history surveys given to patients, it was found that application of the MIPOGG algorithm identified the 8% of the cancer survivors who clinicians had identified as having a need for genetics counseling referrals for cancer predisposition testing, while also identifying another 24% of patients who would be more likely to benefit from genetic counseling referral. In collaboration with hospital and university colleagues, research partners around the world, and most importantly his patients, Dr. Kuo is making strides towards new discoveries in the area of cancer predispositions, better applications of these rapidly developing technologies, and optimal care for our patients and families. IMPLICATION : Pediatric oncology patients and their families are highly interested in genetic cancer predispositions syndromes. Guidelines and algorithms can effectively identify the patients who would benefit from cancer predispositions screening. References: Yedla M, Goudie C, Reichman L, Schneider A, Kanegaye M, Kuo DJ.

Recent studies have shown that medulloblastoma patients are very heterogenous, but despite this, most patients receive the same therapies, and many end up dying of their disease. Dr. Wechsler-Reya and colleagues hypothesized that tailoring therapy based on the characteristics of each patient's tumor might improve outcomes. To test this, they established xenografts from 20 medulloblastoma patients and subjected them to DNA sequencing, gene expression profiling, and high-throughput drug screening, and then used the results to predict effective therapies. Importantly, they found that each patient's tumor cells were sensitive to a distinct set of drugs, that there was significant variability in responsiveness to \"standard-of-care\" therapies, and that drug screening could help identify novel therapies for each patient. Notably, they discovered that Actinomycin D - a chemotherapy drug used for treatment of sarcoma but rarely for brain tumors - is active against Group 3 medulloblastoma, the most aggressive form of the disease. These studies suggested that incorporating functional analyses such as drug screening can enhance the predictive power of traditional, sequencing-based precision medicine. IMPLICATION : Based on this work, Dr. Wechsler-Reya and Dr. John Crawford, Director of Neuro-Oncology at Rady Children's Hospital, have begun to use a similar approach for patients undergoing treatment for brain tumors. Patient samples obtained from surgery are subjected to DNA and RNA sequencing, DNA methylation analysis and drug screening, and the results are discussed by a multi-disciplinary molecular tumor board, which is focused on identifying the most appropriate therapies for each patient. The goal of this analysis is to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and begin to treat each patient with therapies that are effective against their specific tumor.

Preliminary analyses identified that genes from these gene clusters are involved in intracellular signaling and growth factor receptor intracellular trafficking pathways. The Zage lab has previously identified a key role for the ubiquitin ligase UBE4B in the regulation of growth factor receptor trafficking in neuroblastoma tumor cells, and the UBE4B gene was one of the genes identified in these clusters. IMPLICATION : UBE4B gene expression is strongly associated with neuroblastoma patient outcomes, and UBE4B expression and activity are correlated with receptor trafficking, responses to therapy, and tumor differentiation, suggesting that UBE4B may function as a novel tumor suppressor, prognostic marker, and therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.

They have identified a role for NME1 as a histidine kinase and have shown that expression of NME1 is associated with neuroblastoma patient outcomes and that histidine phosphorylation is present in neuroblastoma cells and tumors. They have also determined that NME1 expression is involved in neuroblastoma cell migration and differentiation. IMPLICATION : These results suggest novel roles for histidine kinases in neuroblastoma tumors and that NME1 represents a potential therapeutic target for the development of a completely new class of kinase inhibitors for neuroblastoma.

There has been a recent migration to selective ductal (patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]) stenting for some of these Universal (nonselective) ductal stenting for all infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow is controversial. Dr. El-Said and her team examined the outcomes from a single center with this practice change. They compared outcomes from of all ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow infants (2013-2020 [January-June]) in the following treatment eras: Era 1 (selective most received Blalock-Taussig shunt (62% [41/66]). In Era 2, all received PDA stents (100% [22/22]). There were more females in Era 2, but otherwise no demographic differences between eras. There were no differences in mortality, treatment failures, complications, or re-interventions between eras. Post-procedure length of stay was shorter in Era 2 (8 versus 22 days, P=0.02). There were less surgical revisions for PDA and Ductal Dependent Pulmonary Blood FlowHOWAIDA EL-SAID, MD, PHD Professor of Pediatrics Cardiology RESEARCH INTERESTS: Neonatal cardiac intervention to improve outcomes.

It was concluded that PDA stenting for almost all ductal dependent cyanotic newborns can be safe and effective and may have lower morbidity than selective PDA stenting.

The procedure is early in its evolution. Procedural and short-term outcomes of preterm neonates and infants undergoing transcatheter PDA occlusion with a new, commercially available device were reviewed. Eight preterm neonates and infants born at median 27 weeks gestation (23-36 weeks) underwent transcatheter PDA device closure with Micro Plug Set. The device is short (2.5 mm) with a range of diameters (3, 4, 5, 6 mm) and delivered through a microcatheter. Procedures were performed at median 41 days of age (12-88 days) and at 1690 grams (760-3310 grams). More than half of the patients required pre-procedure ventilator support. Transvenous PDA device occlusion was performed with fluoroscopic and echocardiography guidance.

There were no procedural or short-term adverse events. It was concluded that Preterm neonate and infant transcatheter PDA device closure with a new, commercially available short and microcatheter delivered device (Micro Plug Set) was safe.

Identification of a pathogen is critical in determining appropriate therapy. However, standard diagnostic testing has limited sensitivity. In this case series of children with infective endocarditis, the use of plasma next-generation sequencing (Karius, Redwood, CA) identified an organism in 10 cases. Cell-free plasma metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) utilizes a is culture-independent and noninvasive to detect microbial DNA. Dr. Gupta and her team identified 14 subjects with IE, in whom 10 had mNGS obtained as part of the diagnostic work up. Of these 10 subjects, 30% were female. Median age was 9.6 years [interquartile range (IQR) 7.7-15.0 years], median inpatient length of stay was 24.1 days (IQR 15.1-45.0 days), and median length of antibiotic treatment was 46 days (IQR 42.0-52.0 days). The average turnaround time (sample collection to results received) for mNGS was 3.2 days (SD 1.2 days). Seventy percent (7/10) of subjects had a prior history of underlying heart disease and 60% (6/10) had previously undergone cardiac surgery before diagnosis of IE. Five of 10 subjects had native valve IE. One subject was receiving chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two subjects did not have a predisposing condition. All subjects had an echogenic mass concerning for vegetation on echocardiography and 5 subjects experienced embolic complications associated with endocarditis. Nine subjects required surgical intervention for vegetation removal and/or valve replacement or repair. Six of 9 subjects who underwent surgery had negative tissue cultures. Tissue culture was not sent for 3 subjects. IMPLICATION : The potential value of mNGS in children with IE is consistent with studies that have evaluated clinical utility. Our case series is limited by small sample size and a lack of standardized criteria for ordering mNGS. However, the high positivity rate of mNGS in comparison to blood culture does support the potential utility of mNGS to help with clinical management of IE. Prospective trials are needed to clarify optimal use of this diagnostic tool in the evaluation of IE.

Children and adults with CHD often require one or more heart catheterizations that are currently performed under X-ray fluoroscopy. This puts them and the operator at an increased risk of developing cancer in later life due to exposure to harmful ionizing radiation. In addition, poor soft tissue visualization of critical structures on X-ray fluoroscopy makes complex interventions very challenging especially on pediatric patients. MRI fluoroscopy offers radiation-free multiplanar imaging along with superior soft tissue visualization withing the need for iodinated contrast agents. Over the last decade MRI has been shown to be an excellent radiation-free alternative image guidance for procedures such as heart catheterizations particularly in children with CHD that has the potential to make complex interventions safer. However, conventional critical interventional tools such as guidewires used under X-ray are not safe in the MRI environment due to significant heating of metallic components and poor visibility due to artifacts. This has been the single rate-limiting step to wider clinical translation of MRI guidance of interventional procedures. Dr. Hegde was part of the team that performed the world's first MRI guided cardiac catheterization in children in 2002. His doctoral thesis was on MRI guided catheter tracking and cardiac intervention with a focus on developing MRI compatible devices. In collaboration with scientists in the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering Department at UC San Diego, Dr. Hegde has developed a proprietary nanocomposite shielding technology that takes off-the-shelf, commercial guidewires to make them MRI safe by significantly reducing heating and MRI visible through reduction in artifact. Dr. Hegde and his colleagues were one of five teams selected for the Institute of Global Entrepreneurship inaugural tech accelerator which provided them with funding to develop and patent the technology. IMPLICATION : RI as a radiation free imaging modality with superior soft tissue visualization has become attractive for guidance of interventional heart procedures which have traditionally been performed under X-ray with metallic devices. We developed a proprietary nanocomposite coating to make already commercially available interventional cardiology tools, such as guidewires, MRI safe and visible.

Standard screening approaches to detect these cardiotoxic effects may identify cardiac disease too late, at a time when medical therapy has limited success in preventing disease progression. Earlier detection of cardiac disease is needed to allow for timely, targeted interventions to prevent the development of heart failure. Dr. Narayan seeks to improve the detection and prognostication of anthracycline-related heart failure using novel cardiovascular imaging-based techniques to detect earlier changes in the heart that precede heart failure. In collaboration with investigators in the UC San Diego Department of Bioengineering, Dr. Narayan's team generated three-dimensional computational models of left ventricular shape in a pilot study of childhood cancer survivors. Using a statistical atlas, left ventricular shape was compared between survivors and an asymptomatic reference population, and between survivors exposed to low- and high-dose anthracyclines. These shape comparisons demonstrated that survivors had significantly smaller hearts in comparison with the reference population. In addition, survivors treated with high-dose anthracyclines had specific differences in left ventricular shape in comparison with those treated with low doses. IMPLICATION : These findings suggest that specific changes in left ventricular shape may be an important feature of early anthracycline-related heart failure progression. With further study, these results could lead to the development of new imaging-based disease markers to improve the detection and prognostication of heart failure.Reference: Narayan HK, Xu R, Forsch N, Govil S, Iukuridze D, Lindenfeld L, Adler E, Hegde S, Tremoulet A, Ky B, Armenian S; Omens J; McCulloch AD.

Existing mono-target treatments are not very efficient against this medulloblastoma subtype. Dr. Abagyan and his colleagues predicted computationally that an unrelated approved drug may also inhibit the Smoothened receptor. They found with a range of experiments and in vivo xenograft models that an existing treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, Nilotinib, is suppressing Smoothened in addition to several other kinases essential for tumor growth. It results in reduction of tumor growth and desired effect on cancer stem cells.

Targets of Nilotinib include the Hh-pathway (identified in this study) and several other pathways that are either already known to be dysregulated in Hh-dependent cancers or may serve as escape pathways and are implicated in other cancers. The ability of Nilotinib to inhibit multiple targets simultaneously in Hh-dependent cancers makes it suitable candidate for therapeutic candidate for personalized medicine as compared to specific SMO inhibitors like Vismodegib. Target type is shown by color. RTK stands for receptor tyrosine kinase and nRTK stands for non-receptor tyrosine kinase.. FIGURE. 1Drug companies are not required to study drugs in pregnancy, so data on medication dosing and safety for most drugs is entirely absent, and for other drugs, is not available until years after the drug has already been on the market. Dr. Best and her team conducted a multi-center phase-IV prospective study of darunavir and cobicistat pharmacokinetics in pregnant women with HIV and their infants in the U.S. Intensive steady-state 24 hour pharmacokinetic profiles were performed after administration of 800 mg of darunavir and 150 mg of cobicistat orally in fixed dose combination tablets once-daily during the second trimester, third trimester, and postpartum. Infant washout samples were collected after birth. A total of 29 pregnant women receiving darunavir and cobicistat once-daily were enrolled in the study. Compared to paired postpartum data, darunavir overall exposure (AUC0-24) was 53% lower in the second trimester and 56% lower in the third trimester, while cobicistat AUC0-24 was 50% lower in the second trimester and 56% lower in the third trimester. Placental transfer of darunavir and cobicistat was limited. This study showed that standard adult darunavir/cobicistat doses result in significantly lower exposure during pregnancy, which may increase the risk of maternal virologic failure and perinatal HIV transmission. IMPLICATION : Medications are often needed during pregnancy to protect the health of both the mother and the fetus/infant, but being pregnant may significantly alter the amount of medications in the bloodstream when standard non-pregnant adult doses are used. As an example, Dr. Best and her team showed that darunavir and cobicistat concentrations in many patients during pregnancy are too low - putting the mother at risk for disease progression and the infant at risk for viral transmission - so these commonly prescribed anti-HIV drugs should not be used during pregnancy.

Most of this occurs in infants during pregnancy, delivery or breast feeding. Effective antiretroviral drug therapy given to mothers during pregnancy and post-partum is effective in mitigating transmission to infants. However, it is not always possible to identify and effectively treat HIV during pregnancy and post-partum during breast feeding. Infants from these mothers that are at risk for acquiring HIV infection can benefit from prophylactic treatment to prevent viral infection. As newborns can be sensitive to drug effects and have immature drug elimination, antiviral drug selection and age appropriate dosing are essential considerations both for preventing and treating infant HIV infection. Rapid, effective antiretroviral treatment in infants may also to limit the damage that HIV causes on development of their immune system. The Capparelli lab designs and analyzes studies that measured drug concentrations (pharmacokinetics - PK) and safety of antiretroviral agents to determine optimal dosing of antivirals to prevent and treat HIV infections in newborn infants. These mathematical PK models include characterization of patient factors, such as age, weight, prematurity and genetics that can influence on drug elimination. These PK models can be used to develop dosing strategies for infants at birth and how to make dose adjustments to maintain optimal drug levels during the first few months of life.

This analysis now serves as the basis for US DHHS Pediatric Guidelines for HIV treatment of infants. Dr. Capparelli and his team led the pharmacokinetic evaluation of the first monoclonal antibody (mAB) against HIV, VRC01, to be studied in infants through IMPAACT Study P1112. In infants following subcutaneous administration, VRC01 was absorbed faster but had a lower percent of the dose absorption than adults. They developed a population PK model and performed simulation of various dosing strategies to develop a regimen that maintains concentrations above the target concentration of 50 \u00b5g/mL in over 95% of infants. IMPLICATION : This potential approach may improve prevention of mother to child HIV transmission via breast feeding and minimize the impact of HIV infection on infant health.

Model Informed Development of VRC01 in Newborn Infants There is a large increase in nevirapine metabolism over the first 20 days of life. Infant nevirapine metabolism doubles and is also affected by genetic factors (CYP2B6 516) and prematurity. These factors need to be considered in dosing infants with nevirapine. Naegleria fowleri, commonly known as brain-eating amoeba, is a pathogen that is responsible for severe primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). PAM mostly occurs in healthy children and young adults with recent recreational freshwater exposure. N. fowleri infection is particularly problematic due to the rapid onset and destructive nature of the disease as well as the lack of effective treatments. Despite the use of a cocktail of drugs including the standard of care amphotericin B, the mortality rate of PAM is more than 97% and only four patients survived so far in the US. The use of amphotericin B is also limited by severe dose-limiting side effects, thus development of more effective and safe therapies for PAM is a research priority. Since ergosterol is one of the major sterols in the membrane of N. fowleri, disruption of isoprenoid and sterol biosynthesis by small-molecule inhibitors may be an effective, novel intervention strategy against PAM. HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA into mevalonate. HMGR inhibitors prevent the conversion of HMG-CoA to L- mevalonate resulting in the inhibition of the downstream sterol biosynthesis. The genome of N. fowleri contains a gene encoding HMGR; the catalytic domains of human and N. fowleri HMGR share <60% sequence identity with only two amino acid substitutions in the active site of the enzyme. Considering the similarity of human and N. fowleri HMGR, Dr. Debnath tested well-tolerated and widely used HMGR inhibitors or statins and identified blood-brain barrier permeable pitavastatin with nanomolar to low micromolar potency against five human N. fowleri strains of various genotypes originated from different geographic regions. Pitavastatin exhibited rapid killing effect and his cell biological study confirmed the on-target activity of HMGR inhibitors in N. fowleri. These results set the stage for future testing of pitavastatin in an animal model of infection. IMPLICATION: Development of efficient new antimicrobials to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a critical need to avert future deaths of children. Dr. Debnath and his team identified blood-brain barrier permeable FDA-approved pitavastatin as a fast-acting killing agent against multiple strains of N. fowleri originated from different continents. These results open up the possibility of repurposing pitavastatin for the treatment of PAM. Reference: Hahn HJ, Abagyan R, Podust LM, Roy S, Ali IKM, and Debnath A.

Her study findings demonstrated that Leuprolide acetate given in a single subcutaneous dose every 6 months is safe and effective in stopping the progression of early puberty in young children. The technology involves mixing a copolymer with the active peptide hormone to form a reservoir beneath the skin to release drug over 6 months. Hormone levels were suppressed to age-appropriate levels (Fig & Table below).

His lab builds the computational infrastructure with and for the scientific community and the data analysis ecosystem in 2021 has grown to >450,000 accessions a month. This year Dr. Dorrestein and his team introduced two new search engines and a synchronous collaborative analysis ecosystem allowing many people to analyze data simultaneously. This analysis ecosystem also uses machine learning technologies to link microbial metabolism, drug metabolism, diet, and how they influence health. For example, it is being used to understand how antibiotics given to the mother passed to the breastmilk alter the health of developing infants. In his lab, Dr. Dorrestein uses this platform to understand the molecules made by resident microbes (often referred to the microbiome). In 2021, Dr. Dorrestein discovered that microbes make ~140 bile acids that were previously not yet been described. These are produced in large quantities in infants and adults that have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and cystic fibrosis. These molecules interact with receptors such as FXR. It is, therefore, revealing that resident microbes regulate metabolism and intestinal tissue damage. These discoveries are possible through the development of the collaborative analysis ecosystem that links worldwide data. IMPLICATION : As the connections between humans and our microbial symbionts become increasingly appreciated, a combination of globally untargeted approaches and the development of tools that interlink these datasets (such as the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking and Mass Spectrometry Search Tool analysis infrastructure) will enable the more-efficient characterization of microbial molecules and efficient translation between model animals and human studies, leading to a better understanding of the deep connection between our microbiota, our metabolites and our health Reference: Quinn, R.A., Melnik, A.V., Vrbanac, A. et al.

The revised consensus guidelines for dosing and monitoring vancomycin are an updated version of the 2009 guidelines developed by the American Society of Health-Systems Pharmacists, the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society, and the Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists. Formerly adult-centric, this updated executive summary contains key recommendations that are specific for neonates and pediatrics. With numerous reports of increased nephrotoxicity in adults and pediatric patients when trough level monitoring was used, the area-under-the-curve over 24 hours to minimum inhibitory concentrations (AUC/MIC) has been documented and now serves as the primary pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target. Recent pharmacologic and toxicodynamic studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in vancomycin exposure and nephrotoxicity rates when AUC/MIC monitoring was used vs traditional trough monitoring approaches. In addition, data from neonatal and pediatric pharmacologic studies were critically evaluated and, if robust, integrated to provide dosing recommendations in the effort to optimize exposure based on weight-based dosing. IMPLICATION : While these guidelines originated from the United States, the widespread use of vancomycin worldwide makes these guidelines highly impactful and practice-changing in hospitalized premature infants and children.

Post-discontinuation antibiotic exposure (PDAE) was defined as the time from the last dose to time when concentration decreased below MIC. Neonates had a median (range) gestational age of 26 (22-27) weeks and hours for 2-6 doses) achieved therapeutic exposures > MIC range. After the last dose, the PDAE mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) ranged from 34 to 50 hours (17-79) for E. coli (MIC 8) and 82 to 104 hours (95% CI: 39-122) for GBS (MIC 0.25); longer PDAE occurred with higher dose, shorter interval, and longer course. Short-course ampicillin (2 doses, 50 mg/kg every 12 hours) provided PDAE 34 hours for E. coli and 82 hours for GBS. Single-dose 5 mg/kg gentamicin provided PDAE > MIC 2 for 26 hours. IMPLICATION : In very-low birthweight neonates, ampicillin exposure remains therapeutic long after the last dose. Short-course ampicillin provided therapeutic exposures throughout the typical blood culture incubation period.

During pediatric drug development, extrapolation of efficacy from adult to pediatric populations is a pathway that can minimize the exposure of children to unnecessary clinical trials, thereby improving efficiency and increasing the likelihood of success in obtaining a pediatric indication. The acceptability of the use of extrapolation depends on a series of evidence-based assumptions regarding the similarity of disease, response to intervention, and exposure-response relationships between adult and pediatric patients. This study conducted by Dr. Momper and colleagues evaluated data submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration for drugs approved for CINV to assess the feasibility of extrapolation for future development programs. For 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist antiemetic drugs, efficacy in adults was found to be predictive of efficacy in children, supporting the extrapolation of effectiveness of antiemetic products in children from adequate and well-controlled studies in adult patients with CINV. IMPLICATION : Future development programs for antiemetic drugs to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in pediatric patients may be streamlined by avoiding lengthy and resource-intensive efficacy studies.

PAM has a worldwide distribution although it occurs most frequently in warm areas and during hot summer months in healthy children and young adults with recent recreational fresh water exposure. Based on the free-living amoeba registry maintained by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the fatality rate of PAM is over 97%. Currently, there is no standard regimen for the treatment of Naegleria infections in humans. Identification of new therapeutic targets and development of the efficacious and safe drugs for the PAM treatment is unmet medical need. Over the past few years, Dr. Podust and collaborators at UCSD and Texas Tech University explored the steroidogenic pathway in N. fowleri, validated several steroidogenic enzymes as drug targets and identified small molecule candidates for drug repurposing strategies and for development of novel therapeutics. It was discovered that the FDA-approved CYP51 inhibitors, posaconazole and itraconazole, are superior in their anti-Naegleria activity to Amphotericin B, a cornerstone of the anti-PAM therapy. Furthermore, they have strong synergistic effect with inhibitors targeting the upstream and downstream steroidogenic enzymes. Synergy between alternative drug-targets is of interest for the treatment of PAM, as lower drug concentrations are required to achieve the therapeutic effect. IMPLICATION : Azole antifungal agents targeting sterol 14-demethylase (CYP51) could be used alone or in combination with other drugs, e.g., statins targeting the HMG-CoA reductase, for the treatment of primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM) caused by N. fowleri.

C, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle; BPA, Best Practice Advisory. Despite years of attention, hospitals continue to struggle to implement successful medication reconciliation. Aiming to increase the percentage of hospital admission medication reconciliation (AdmMedRec) completion to 95% in 12 months at a large academic children's hospital, Dr. Rungvivajarus along with an interdisciplinary team of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and analysts, co-led by a pediatric hospitalist and chief medical information officer, initiated a quality improvement (QI) project in April 2017. Interventions were implemented through sequential Plan-Do- Study-Act cycles. Process maps, fishbone diagrams, and failure mode and effects analysis were used to identify AdmMedRec failures. Baseline data from 12,481 admission encounters July 2016-April 2017 were analyzed. Interventions included electronic health record (EHR) workflow redesign, clarification of clinicians' responsibilities, targeted training, Best Practice Advisory alert, and weekly reporting of specialty- and physician-specific performance data. Data from 13,082 postintervention period admission encounters were examined. Reconciliation by therapeutic drug classes was calculated as a proxy for quality. Study results showed AdmMedRec completion rate increased from a baseline of 73% to 95% within 7 months from the start of this project and was sustained at 94% during the post intervention period. Psychiatry and hospital medicine demonstrated the largest improvements, with rates increasing from 17% to 88% and 76% to 98%, respectively. Percentages of reconciled medications in all 13 therapeutic classes, including high-risk drugs, improved significantly (p < 0.05). It was concluded that this QI initiative using an interdisciplinary team and interventions focused on process and culture changes was successful at increasing AdmMedRec rates and reducing omission errors across all therapeutic drug classes. IMPLICATION : This study demonstrated a significant increase in percentages of medications reconciled using clarification of clinicians' roles, EHR modifications, workflow improvement, and increased transparency of data. These methods are generalizable to other institutions. By increasing medication reconciliation adherence and decreasing medication omission error, institutions are taking a central step toward reducing preventable medication errors in the inpatient setting.

Malaria treatment relies primarily on drugs that target the disease-causing asexual blood stages (ABS) of Plasmodium parasites, the organisms responsible for human malaria. Whereas travelers may rely on short-term daily chemoprotective drugs, those living in endemic regions require long-term malaria protection such as insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and vector control. However, ITNs do not fully shield individuals from malaria, may lose potency with time, and can be bulky and difficult to use. Another concern is that mosquitos may become resistant to the active insecticides that are used in ITNs and vector control. An alternative strategy to insecticide treated bednets is chemoprevention. Although millions of compounds have been screened for activity against parasite ABS, and some have been subsequently tested for potential prophylactic activity, large-scale searches that begin with prophylactic activity have not been performed because of the complexity of the assay: This assay requires the production of infected laboratory-reared mosquitoes and hand-dissection of the sporozoite-infected salivary glands from mosquito thoraxes. To discover leads for next-generation chemoprotective antimalarial drugs, the Winzeler lab used luciferase-expressing Plasmodium spp. parasites, dissected from more than a million mosquitoes over a 2-year period, to test more than 500,000 compounds for their ability to inhibit liver-stage development of malaria (681 compounds showed a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of <1 M). These leads were further tested through multiple phenotypic assays that predict stage-specific and multispecies antimalarial activity. Results revealed compound classes that are likely to provide symptomatic relief from blood-stage parasitemia in addition to providing protection. These findings substantially expand the set of compounds with demonstrated activity against two known targets of chemoprotective drugs, cytochrome bc1 and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. These present a rich collection of chemical diversity that may be used to accelerate malaria elimination. Work is currently underway to translate these discoveries into next generation drugs. IMPLICATION : The development of new, more effective methods for preventing malaria could save the lives of millions of children over the next decade.

The malaria parasite lifecycle. Infection begins with the bite of infected mosquito which releases Plasmodium sporozoites which migrate to the liver and establish a silent infection. To identify drug candidate molecules we obtain mosquitos that have fed on malaria-infected mice and dissect malaria sporozoites from these mosquito. The sporozoites are used in an assay that can detect whether they develop productivity in cultured liver cells. Subsequent dose response curves determine whether compounds have enough potency to protect patients from malaria. FIGURE. 1The most common cause of acquired heart disease in children in the developed world, Kawasaki disease (KD), causes significant morbidity and mortality by injuring the endothelial layer of coronary arteries. Statins have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects that help promote endothelial cell health and thus may be helpful in acute KD. The Tremoulet lab launched a Phase I/IIa study of atorvastatin in children as young as two years old to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunomodulatory effects of a 6-week course of atorvastatin in children with acute KD with coronary artery aneurysms. They found that atorvastatin was safe and well-tolerated and that the metabolism of atorvastatin in children was slower than in adults. This study has now been launched in Japan, where the incidence of KD is at least three times higher than in the United States. Endothelial cells line the blood vessels and may be the first targets of inflammation in acute KD. To understand if endothelial cells changes occur in acute KD and if atorvastatin treatment might impact these changes, Dr. Tremoulet and her team collaborated with Dr. Shyy's lab at UCSD. Incubating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with sera from acute KD patients prior to any treatment demonstrated increased endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) markers, a sign of cell-mediated damage to the coronary arterial wall in acute KD patients. Treating HUVECs with atorvastatin interfered with this cell-mediated injury. This was further studied by RNA sequencing that showed that treatment with atorvastatin led to expression of markers of endothelial cell health, including the transcription factor KLF4, while suppressing molecules that induce EndoMT. IMPLICATION : Given the likely benefits of atorvastatin in KD patients with a history of aneurysms, this therapy is now being used in KD patients with a long-standing history of aneurysms. Members of the UCSD/Rady Children's Hospital San Diego KD Research Center (Drs. Kirsten Dummer and Koichi Miyata) are now studying endothelial cell health in these KD patients with a long-term history of coronary artery aneurysms. Using a device (EndoPAT) that measures endothelial cell response to increased blood flow, the team will measure endothelial cell function in the artery of the arm (brachial artery) of KD patients before and after atorvastatin treatment. Dr. Tremoulet is hopeful that these clinical and molecular evaluations will provide additional information on the potential benefits of statins in KD patients with aneurysms.

Dr. Bandoli and her team characterized PAE into longitudinal trajectories and found that low-to-moderate sustained alcohol use was more strongly associated with most negative infant outcomes than moderate-to-high PAE with early reduction. IMPLICATION : These findings reinforced the important public health message that no matter the initial amount of consumption, alcohol intake cessation increases the chances for improved offspring outcomes, and demonstrated a new tool to better classify PAE.

Patterns of prenatal alcohol exposure based upon absolute ounces/day of alcohol across 40 weeks of gestation (n=471) Patterns of antidepressant use among 15,041 deliveries with at least one antidepressant claim between last menstrual period and 35 weeks of gestation.Using longitudinal trajectory methods, Dr. Bandoli classified patterns of antidepressant use from a cohort of 15,000 women with antidepressant use during pregnancy. There was an increased risk of preterm birth among the highest-use groups, and all patterns of use, even those with early pregnancy discontinuation of antidepressants, were associated with greater risk for neonatal respiratory distress. IMPLICATION : This methodological approach can help clinicians caring for pregnant women to identify groups whose infants may be at higher risk for preterm birth or neonatal respiratory distress.

Qualitative results uncovered key COVID-related stressors. Most prominent among these were the impacts of social distancing and changing duties / workload. Pandemic-Related Stressors Burnout Among Risk & Safety Professionals Social Distancing Changing Duties & Workload Financial Impacts Real and Potential Impacts of the Virus Untrustworthy / Constantly Changing Guidance Bullying 70% Burnout RateThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated an ongoing epidemic of burnout among healthcare workers (HCWs). Most literature on pandemic-related stress has focused rightly on clinicians, but other HCWs have also been affected. This study investigates burnout and sources of COVID-related stress among a group of healthcare quality and safety practitioners. Members of the Southern California Association for Healthcare Risk Management (SCAHRM) were asked to complete an online survey including a validated burnout instrument, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory (OBI), and one open-ended question: \"Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, what work or non work-related issues have been causing you the most stress?\" 31 participants (~17% of the organization's 187 members) completed the OBI and 27 responded to the open-ended question. Over 70% of participants were experiencing burnout. Stressors were organized into several key themes, including: The impacts of social distancing, changing duties and workload, the real and potential impacts of the virus (e.g., fear of infection for self or others), and financial concerns (both personal and organizational). Less common themes included untrustworthy and constantly changing guidance, feeling abused by persons in power, and positive comments about the experience of working during the pandemic.Although a larger sample will be needed to estimate the true prevalence of burnout among quality and safety professionals, these findings suggest that burnout and pandemic-related stress may be very common in this population. This high level of burnout has implications beyond the direct human cost to the workers involved. Among clinicians and other professionals, burnout is associated with impaired work performance. If this holds true among members of the healthcare quality and safety workforce, high levels of burnout represent a threat to patient safety and the delivery of high-quality care. Turnover related to occupational stress may also lead to poorer outcomes, given the dearth of experienced quality & safety professionals prepared to step into these roles. IMPLICATION: Shortfalls in healthcare safety and quality are a major cause of illness and death in the United States and around the world. Burnout among healthcare quality and safety professionals may reduce the ability of healthcare organizations to effectively address the causes of quality and safety problems. This study demonstrates that these professionals may be a high-risk group for burnout and related outcomes, and identifies key pandemic-related stressors that could be targeted to reduce those risks.

Prompt diagnoses are necessary to provide early intervention services in a timely manner; however, the availability of diagnostic expertise is limited. Based on their research finding, Dr. Del Campo and his team have concluded that telemedicine is a valid and reliable method for the examination of the physical features of FAS. This study was performed at two different sites at the University of California, San Diego that were physically sequestered to assure isolation of the two examiners from each other. Two different Telemedicine (TM) systems were compared. The first utilized hand-held devices, an iPhone and an iPad , and secure Zoom conferencing. The second utilized a Transportable Examination Station (TES) which included a fully mobile telemedicine platform equipped with an integrated High Definition video camera, and its own secure transmission, with an approximate cost of $20,000 (Figure 1). All children in the study were examined face to face (F2F) on two separate occasions by each examiner. These physical examinations were viewed in real time by the other examiner at the receiver end, one using Zoom, and the second using TES. All data for the 4 physical examinations were compared, agreement using Cohen's K was calculated for the two exams F2F, and the agreement between the F2F exams and the two exams using the two different TM methods. The collected data that were compared between the 4 were the measurements of the head circumference (HC) and the evaluation of the three key facial features, including palpebral fissure length (PF), smooth philtrum and thin and smooth vermilion of the upper lip. For the two examiners combined, the agreement observed between the two F2F examinations (K=0.89) for the diagnosis of FAS was in the almost perfect range. The agreement between F2F exams and ZOOM (K=0.85) and TES (K=0.89) for the individual features contributing to the diagnosis of FAS were all in the almost perfect range. In conclusion, the finding of high agreement between F2F and TM exams demonstrates the validity and reliability of telemedicine for the identification of the physical features of FASD through remotely guided dysmorphology examinations, using specialized equipment or widely available, affordable hand-held devices with cameras. IMPLICATION : Proving the validity of an accurate telemedicine recognition of dysmorphic features will impact the diagnosis of FAS without a need for expert examiners in place.

SASEA was developed to ensure that all students, staff, and their families feel safe at school regardless of their neighborhood, race/ethnicity, or economic status. Dr. Fielding-Miller and her team developed and pilot tested SASEA in partnership with 15 schools serving low-income and racial/ethnic minority communities across San Diego County throughout the 2020-2021 academic year. Together with these partner schools and SDHHSA they have developed an environmental monitoring and diagnostic testing system that consists of: (1) Daily environmental sampling and testing for SARS-CoV-2 using (a) wastewater from the whole site and (b) surface swabs from specific classrooms (typically collected from the center of a classroom floor) with genomic sequencing of samples that test polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive; (2) Rapid reporting to site administrators when environmental samples test positive (current turnaround time approx. 36 hours); (3A) Responsive on-site diagnostic testing using FDA authorized PCR tests via the CLIA-certified UCSD EXCITE Lab led by Drs. Knight and Laurent (co-Is) to diagnose asymptomatic positive cases when environmental monitoring suggests there is a potential case on site; (3B) Mitigating risk via environmental modification (e.g., moving classes outdoors, increasing ventilation in classrooms with a potential case) and health communication messaging (e.g., encouraging double masking, recommending wider testing among household members) until a case is identified and/or until the wastewater or surface samples remain negative for at least 2 days; and (4) Identify resources and recommendations for safe isolation of cases and quarantine of their contacts. SASEA's goal is to transform schools and childcare sites from places of perceived risk to trusted community assets for historically marginalized communities. IMPLICATION : Wastewater and surface monitoring in schools has the potential to provide ongoing sentinel surveillance data for the community served by a school, including genomic surveillance to monitor the introduction and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern with neighborhood-level resolution.

Dr. Jones and his team demonstrated in 4 communities in different regions of the U.S. that FASD prevalence is at least 1-5% in first grade children, and is at least as common as autism spectrum disorders, but largely unrecognized. Active case ascertainment methods using a cross-sectional design were used to assess children for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders between 2010 and 2016. Children were systematically assessed in the 4 domains that contribute to the fetal alcohol spectrum disorder continuum: dysmorphic features, physical growth, neurobehavioral development, and prenatal alcohol exposure. The settings were 4 communities in the Rocky Mountain, Midwestern, Southeastern, and Pacific Southwestern regions of the United States. First-grade children and their parents or guardians were enrolled. Prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in the 4 communities was the main outcome. Conservative estimates for the prevalence of the disorder and 95% CIs were calculated using the eligible first-grade population as the denominator. Weighted prevalences and 95% CIs were also estimated, accounting for the sampling schemes and using data restricted to children who received a full evaluation. Prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in 4 US CommunitiesKENNETH LYONS JONES, MD Distinguished Professor of PediatricsDivision Chief, Dysmorphology and Teratotolgy RESEARCH INTERESTS: Clinical delineation of birth defects, mechanisms of normal and abnormal morphogenesis and the recognition of new human teratogens. The prevalence of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) differs among populations and is largely unknown among minority populations. Prevalence and characterization of FASD is necessary for prevention efforts and allocation of resources for treatment and support. However, prevalence data are lacking, including among many minority populations. The aim of this study was to obtain an FASD prevalence estimate in a Southern California American Indian community employing active case-ascertainment. In 2016, American Indian children aged 5-7 years and their caregivers were recruited in collaboration with Southern California Tribal Health Clinic. Children were assessed using physical examinations and neurobehavioral testing. Parent or guardian interviews assessed child behavior and prenatal exposures including alcohol. Of 488 children identified as eligible to participate, 119 families consented and 94 completed assessments to allow a classification for FASD. Participating children (n = 94) were an average of 6.61 \u00b1 0.91 years old and half were female. Most interviews were conducted with biological mothers (85.1%). Less than one third (29.8%) of mothers reported consuming any alcohol in pregnancy and 19.1% met study criteria for risky alcohol exposure prior to pregnancy recognition. Overall 20 children met criteria for FASD, resulting in an estimated minimum prevalence of 41.0 per 1000 (4.1%). No cases of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) were identified; 14 (70.0%) met criteria for alcohol related neuro- developmental disorder (ARND). The Prevalence of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders in an American Indian Community A total of 6639 children were selected for participation from a population of 13 146 first-graders (boys, 51.9%; mean age, 6.7 years [SD, 0.41] and white maternal race, 79.3%). A total of 222 cases of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders were identified. The conservative prevalence estimates for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranged from 11.3 (95% CI, 7.8-15.8) to 50.0 (95% CI, 39.9-61.7) per 1000 children. The weighted prevalence estimates for fetal alcohol spectrum disorders ranged from 31.1 (95% CI, 16.1-54.0) to 98.5 (95% CI, 57.5-139.5) per 1000 children. IMPLICATION : This discovery increased global recognition of the public health impact of FASD, and has led to a number of initiatives to improve access to diagnosis, treatment, prevention.

Dr. Jones and his team concluded that the prevalence estimate in this reservation-based community was not different from the estimate obtained in the national study and that diagnoses were similarly primarily based on behavioral variables. It's important because, even though a smaller proportion of Native women consume alcohol compared to their non-Native counterparts, FASDs must still be prevented, diagnosed, and treated among indigenous communities. IMPLICATION : These study findings contribute to the understanding of FASD among minority populations, specifically AIAN populations. In addition to providing information helpful for clinical resource allocation, this study raises questions about community resilience and the effect of culture. Future research into community-specific risk and protective factors is warranted.

However, little is known about other tobacco advertising and progression to tobacco use in youth and young adults. Dr. Pierce and colleagues investigated whether receptivity to tobacco advertising among youth and young adults is associated with progression (being a susceptible never user or ever user) to use of the product advertised, as well as conventional cigarette smoking. The Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study at wave 1 (2013-2014) and 1-year follow-up at wave 2 (2014-2015) was conducted in a US population-based sample of never tobacco users aged 12 to 24 years from wave 1 of the PATH Study (N = 10,989). Household interviews were conducted using audio computer-assisted self-interviews. Of the 10,989 participants 5579 female [weighted percentage, 51.7%]), receptivity to any tobacco advertising at wave 1 was high for those aged 12 to 14 years (44.0%; 95% confidence limit [CL], 42.6%-45.4%) but highest for those 18 to 21 years (68.7%; 95% CL, 64.9%-72.2%). e-Cigarette advertising had the highest receptivity among all age groups. For those aged 12 to 17 years, susceptibility to use a product at wave 1 was significantly associated with product use at wave 2 for conventional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco products. Among committed never users aged 12 to 17 years at wave 1, any receptivity was associated with progression toward use of the product at wave 2 (conventional cigarettes: adjusted not receptive to any product advertising, receptivity to e-cigarette advertising, but not to cigarette advertising, was independently associated with those aged 12 to 21 years having used a cigarette at wave 2 (AOR, 1.60; 95% CL, 1.08-2.38). Receptivity to tobacco advertising among adolescent never users was significantly associated with experimentation progression with cigarettes, e-cigarettes as well as cigars. Moreover, there was evidence that receptivity to e-cigarette advertising was also associated with trying a cigarette. IMPLICATION : Just as for cigarettes, marketing of e-cigarettes and other tobacco products is associated with increases in initiation of tobacco use. E-cigarette advertising, which is currently not restricted, not only encourages adolescents to try an e-cigarette but it was also associated with trying cigarettes.

At wave 4, 12% were daily tobacco users, of whom 70% were daily cigarette smokers (95% CI: 67.4% to 73.0%); 28-year-olds 2.4% to 4.4%). Compared with single product triers, the risk of progressing to daily cigarette smoking was 15 percentage points higher (adjusted risk difference [aRD] 15%; 95% CI: 12% to 18%) among those who tried 5 products. In particular, e-cigarette use increased the risk of later daily cigarette smoking by threefold (3% vs 10%; aRD 7%; 95% CI: 6% to 9%). lower (aRD -6%; 95% CI: -8% to -4%) for those who experimented after age 18 years. Results indicate that trying e-cigarettes and multiple other tobacco products before age 18 years is strongly associated with later daily cigarette smoking. The recent large increase in e-cigarette use will likely reverse the decline in cigarette smoking among US young adults. IMPLICATION : Young people becoming addicted smokers is a public health concern because it is so hard to quit. This study demonstrates that trying an e-cigarette or multiple other tobacco products before 18 years of age is associated with young people becoming addicted cigarette smokers within 4 years. It emphasizes the need for public health action to apply the same restrictions on marketing for e-cigarettes as exist for marketing cigarettes.

Some studies found youth are less physically active in the summer, but it is unknown whether this seasonal difference varies across race, ethnic, and sex subgroups. The aim of this study was to examine race/ethnic and sex differences in adolescent physical activity, sedentary behavior, and related variables, comparing the school year and summer. In a study of over 200 highly-diverse adolescents, daily physical activity was 14 minutes per day lower in the summer than the school day. This decline was seen in all race/ethnic groups and both sexes. American Indians, Latinos, and girls were the least active groups in the summer. All racial and ethnic groups were sedentary between 8 and 9 hours per day, which did not differ from the school year to the summer, even though youth were not forced to sit in school for hours each day in the summer. All groups of adolescents reported more screen time in the summer, except for American Indians, and African Americans increased the most. Walking was the most preferred activity for virtually all subgroups, and around the home was the most preferred place to be active. Declines in physical activity and increases in screen time from the school year to the summer were documented in virtually all subgroups of low-income adolescents. Thus, population-wide interventions are needed to increase physical activity in the summer. IMPLICATION : Reduced physical activity and more screen time in the summer among low-income adolescents could contribute to excess weight gain and diminished mental health, making health disparities worse. Pediatricians should consider providing guidance and resources to help adolescents stay active and minimize screen time during the summer. Study findings suggest that interventions providing safe conditions and support for walking in neighborhoods are promising for all race, ethnic, and sex subgroups of adolescents.

IMPLICATION : (and relevance to childhood health): Parental longevity represents the combined effects of genetic, behavioral, socioeconomic, and environmental factors transmitted from parents to children that, throughout the life course, influence future ageing outcomes among children. Study findings suggest that children who inherit genes for longevity from their parents, grow up in better socioeconomic environments (i.e., with more wealth), and learn more positive lifestyle behaviors from their parents (e.g., eating well and exercising) are predisposed to achieving longevity and healthy aging themselves. Overall, Dr. Shadyab's data suggest that early life factors in childhood have long-term impacts on adult health and aging. Reference: Shadyab AH et al.

SHADYAB, PHD Assistant Professor of Epidemiology Herbert Wertheim School of Public Health and Human Longevity Science RESEARCH INTERESTS: Longevity, aging, women's health, and geriatrics. Children with long-lived parents are more likely to have higher socioeconomic status, inherit longevity genes from their parents, and enjoy an overall healthier lifestyle, which increases their chances of living a long and healthy life.FIGURE. 1 Children with long-lived parents Inherit longevity genesHave more positive lifestyle behaviorsHave higher socioeconomic status Achieve longevity without disease or disabilityIn a large sample of >8,000 women, Dr. Shadyab and his team found that women born to fathers 35 years and older vs. 30-34 years at the time of their births were 15% more likely to achieve healthy aging, defined as survival to age 90 without major chronic diseases (coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, or hip fracture) or mobility disability (i.e., needing crutches, a walker, or a wheelchair to walk or having difficulties in walking one block or climbing one flight of stairs). IMPLICATION : (and relevance to childhood health): Children born to older fathers tend to have greater access to economic resources. Therefore, these study findings suggest that childhood socioeconomic status strongly predicts longevity and healthy aging. Children born to older fathers also tend to have longer leukocyte telomere length, a biomarker of aging that is associated with longevity and healthy aging. Reference: Shadyab AH et al.

Insecticides, such as organophosphates, carbamates or pyrethroids, are designed to hijack the nervous system of insects, but there is growing evidence that exposures to these insecticides may affect the brain development of children. The study of Secondary Pesticide Exposures among Children and Adolescents (ESPINA) is a study that has examined 623 children and adolescents living in agricultural settings in the Ecuadorian Andes since 2008. The 14th year of follow-up of study participants is currently planned for 2022. In analyses from 2008 and 2016, Dr. Suarez and his team observed that residential proximity to greenhouse crops was associated with greater biomarkers of pesticide exposure among children living within 275m of crops. Furthermore, performance on neurobehavioral tasks including Memory & Learning, Attention & Inhibitory Control and Language were lower among children living within 100m of crops, and especially within 50m, compared to children living farther than 500m. These findings indicate the amount of off-target pesticide drift from treated crops to nearby homes not only increases the exposure potential of children but can affect various mental health processes. IMPLICATION : These findings reflect the upstream effects of the global demand for flowers, which result in increased agrochemical exposures to populations living near flower crops. These findings also indicate that off-target pesticide drift from treated crops is reaching children living nearby and affecting mental health processes needed for learning and executing tasks. The findings of this study can inform the planning of floricultural land use and residential zoning policy considerations. Added precautions to reduce the off-target drift of pesticides from greenhouse crops onto nearby homes are recommended.

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are thought to be the leading cause of developmental disabilities worldwide. Accurate estimates of the prevalence of FASD have been lacking. An improved estimate of FASD prevalence in the U.S. was recently reported in Journal of the American Medical Association (2018) where Dr. Xu led the Data Analysis and Coordination Core. The study used multistage methods of active case ascertainment of first-grade children with FASD in four regions in the U.S. Each method relied on parental consent and therefore had potential non-response bias. In a follow-up paper Dr. Xu and her colleagues considered weighted approaches, where the weights were formed using the distribution of observed variables in the population from which the samples were drawn. The researchers further described sensitivity analyses using methodology developed for causal inference, to account for other unobserved variables that are likely to affect both non-response and FASD outcome. Their results showed feasible regions of FASD prevalence under certain assumptions, and provided a framework for explaining the non-response bias due to the unobserved variables.

A range of phenotypes, including diabetes insipidus, renal-tract abnormalities and sensorineural deafness, are observed in individuals with Wolfram syndrome. In the absence of optic atrophy and other non-diabetic phenotypes, Wolfram syndrome can be clinically misdiagnosed as non-autoimmune type 1 diabetes. Dr. Bansal and his team identified a novel, mild-form of Wolfram syndrome - characterized by later onset of diabetes - that is caused by a population-specific missense variant in the WFS1 gene. This variant (p.R558C) that affects a conserved amino acid residue has an allele frequency of 1.4% in individuals with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry and represents a founder mutation causing a recessive disease. They identified 9 individuals homozygous for this variant using cohorts from Germany and Israel. All individuals were diagnosed with juvenile-onset diabetes, however, in comparison to Wolfram syndrome, the phenotype of these individuals was mild with later onset of diabetes, reduced penetrance for optic atrophy and absence of hearing loss. One individual had the ocular phenotype of keratoconus (thinning of the cornea) - the first time that this phenotype has been associated with mutations in WFS1. Recent work (Waszczykowska et al. Am. Journal of Ophthalmology, 2020) has confirmed this observation of corneal abnormalities in individuals with Wolfram syndrome. IMPLICATION: Genetic testing for this missense variant in individuals diagnosed with early-onset diabetes and who are negative for autoimmune antibodies can identify individuals with undiagnosed Wolfram syndrome. Timely diagnosis of Wolfram syndrome can improve an individual's prognosis, detect Wolfram syndrome-related complications and enable genetic counseling of family members.

Functional annotation of a SNP (rs6801957) associated with heart rate. From top to bottom: regional plot of association P values, with SNPs color coded based on linkage disequilibrium (r2; squared Pearson correlation) values from the 1000 Genome Project CEU population and lead GWAS variants from other studies in the locus indicated by a diamond; fgwas PPAs of the the locus; epigenetic from iPSC-CM combined samples; and Roadmap fetal heart ChromHMM and genes from the UCSC Genome Browser. Inset: allelic imbalance (pie chart) of NKX2-5 ASEs with FRD-corrected P values, and the altered TF motif. These analyses show SNP rs6801957 is associated with heart rate through disrupting NKX2-5 binding.The cardiac transcription factor (TF) gene NKX2-5 has been associated with electrocardiographic (EKG) traits through genome-wide association studies (GWASs), but the extent to which differential binding of NKX2-5 at common regulatory variants contributes to these traits has not yet been studied. Dr. Frazer and her team analyzed transcriptomic and epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes from seven related individuals, and identified single-nucleotide with allele-specific effects (ASE-SNVs) ASE-SNVs were enriched for altered TF motifs, for heart-specific expression quantitative trait loci and for EKG GWAS signals. Using fine-mapping combined with epigenomic data from induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, the Frazer lab prioritized candidate causal variants for EKG traits, many of which were characterizing two NKX2-5 ASE-SNVs (rs3807989 and rs590041) showed that they modulate the expression of target genes via differential protein binding in cardiac cells, indicating that they are functional variants underlying EKG GWAS signals. Results show that differential NKX2-5 binding at numerous regulatory variants across the genome contributes to EKG phenotypes. IMPLICATION : Identifying variants associated with EKG traits has significant public health implications. Such knowledge can be used to identify individuals with increased risk of cardiac disease and in the future could potentially be used to tailor personalized treatment plans.

FIGURE. 1[ 78 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 79 ] Type 1 diabetes risk variants affect enhancer activity and CFTR expression in pancreatic ducal cells. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a complex autoimmune disease that affects over 1 million individuals in the US yet the etiology remains poorly understood. Genome-wide studies have revealed many genetic loci contributing to T1D risk and understanding how these loci function can reveal molecular mechanisms underlying disease, yet most loci are non-coding and have no obvious function. In their recent study Dr. Gaulton and his team combined the largest to-date genome-wide association study (GWAS) of T1D with single cell epigenome maps to interpret the function of genetic variants influencing T1D risk. 136 signals associated with T1D risk were identified, including rare variants with large effects on T1D, almost half of which were novel. Using single cell ATAC-seq of peripheral blood and pancreas, Dr. Gaulton derived accessible chromatin profiles for 28 different cell types and defined candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in each cell type. T1D-associated variants were highly enriched in cCREs specific to and ductal T1D in exocrine-specific cCREs linked to genes with exocrine-specific expression. At T1D variants mapped in a cell-specific cCRE near the CFTR gene, and the Gaulton lab validated effects on CFTR using CRISPRi in ductal cells. T1D variants at exocrine signals were also associated with pancreatitis, suggesting a link between T1D and pancreatic disease. Together these findings provide evidence that the exocrine pancreas plays a causal role in the development of T1D and implicate specific genes such as CFTR in mediating T1D risk within exocrine cells. IMPLICATION : The discovery of genetic factors for T1D can help predict disease risk, including in individuals carrying rare, large effect variants. Furthermore, the exocrine pancreas and genes affecting exocrine cell function may represent new areas for therapeutic targeting to prevent disease.Reference: Chiou J, Geusz RJ, Okino M, Han JY, Miller M, Melton R, Beebe E, Benaglio P, Huang S, Korgaonkar K, Heller S, Kleger A, Preissl S, Gorkin DU, Sander M, Gaulton KJ.

Technologies in this space has the potential to deliver robust translational impact in understanding both infectious and immune-mediated diseases. To achieve the full potential of a shared gene signature, Dr. Sahoo and his team use a mathematical concept of \"invariant\" that describes formula in Boolean logic that are true in every conditions. To showcase the powerful and superior nature of this approach over other conventional methods, their preliminary work has molded into two distinct discoveries: (i) the development of a drug-discovery platform to solve an unmet and urgent grand challenge in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The Sahoo lab demonstrated how to compute invariant disease gene signatures and developed machine learning approaches to extract spectrum of disease continuum states from healthy to IBD. (ii) A computational framework (disease map) to navigate the uncharted territory of COVID-19. An unbiased AI-guided approach was used to identify and validate a set of gene expression signatures that is an indicator of disease severity in respiratory viral pandemics (ViP and severe (s)ViP signatures). The signatures: (a) defined the nature (IL15-centric), extent and source of the cytokine storm in COVID-19; (b) set objective therapeutic goals; (c) assess the efficacy of a given drug/intervention on the disease. IMPLICATION : The computational approach helps model a disease using a map of successive changes in gene expression at the onset and during the progression of the disease. What sets this mapping apart from other existing models is the use of mathematical precision to recognize and extract all possible fundamental rules of gene expression patterns, many of which are overlooked by current methodologies. The approach could help determine whether new treatments and vaccines are working in patients. References: Sahoo D, Swanson Chang JT, Sandborn WJ, Das S, Ghosh P.

Dr. Sajti in collaboration with Dr. Glass, applied genomic and epigenomic techniques to identify molecular mechanisms underlying the individual variation in lung inflammation. As a model they used inbred mouse strains that differ in their susceptibility to lung injury. By comparing gene expression and gene regulation in lung immune cells isolated from mice that are susceptible and resistant to lung injury, Dr. Sajti identified the transcription factors and signaling molecules likely regulating cell-specific functional potential and response to inflammatory stimuli. To understand cell heterogeneity in the human developing lung, the Sajti lab collaborated with Dr. Xin Sun, the Center for Epigenomics and the NHLBI LungMap Consortium. The analysis of non-diseased lung samples obtained from donors of 30 weeks gestation, 3 years and 30 years at the single cell level provided molecular insight into lung development at an unprecedented resolution. By analyzing gene expression, the team found that host entry genes for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, were less expressed in neonatal and pediatric lungs compared to adult lungs. This offers clues why young children account for only a small percentage of COVID-19 infections. IMPLICATION : Determining the specific role of immune cell subsets in lung inflammation and identifying candidate genes and pathways that contribute to or protect against disease will allow targeted pharmacological therapy in a selective and developmentally appropriate manner.

While morbidity and mortality are highest in infants with underlying genetic conditions, molecular ascertainment remains low. Furthermore, cost of care for children and adults with CHD are high. Rapid whole genome sequencing (rWGS) of newborns in intensive care units with suspected genetic diseases has been associated with increased rate of diagnosis and a net reduction in cost of care. To determine whether the clinical utility of rWGS extended to critically ill infants with structural CHD, a retrospective review of rWGS study data obtained from inpatient infants <1 year with structural CHD was performed. rWGS diagnosed genetic disease in 46% of the enrolled infants. Moreover, genetic disease was identified five times more frequently with rWGS than microarray+/- gene panel testing in twenty-one of these infants (rWGS diagnosed 43% versus 10% with microarray+/- gene panels, p=0.02). Molecular diagnoses ranged from syndromes affecting multiple organ systems to disorders limited to the cardiovascular system. The average daily hospital spending was lower in the time period post blood collection for rWGS compared to prior (p=0.003) and further decreased after rWGS results (p=0.000). The cost was not prohibitive to rWGS implementation in the care of this cohort of infants. rWGS provided timely actionable information that impacted care and there was evidence of decreased hospital spending around rWGS implementation. IMPLICATION : rWGS can be effectively implemented in the care of critically ill children and aids in more effective healthcare delivery. Furthermore, the databank of variants of unknown significance suspicious for implication in structural CHD curated during sequencing will serve as a powerful resource for further research in the etiology of structural CHD. Investigation and validation of these variants as pathogenic will revolutionize the care of children with structural CHD by accelerating the application of precision medicine in this patient population and drastically improve outcomes.

The many maternal benefits include protection from breast and ovarian cancer and cardiometabolic disorders. Although the mechanisms underlying some of these benefits have been elucidated, the origins of others that have been reported, such as influence on adult IQ and later protection against obesity and diabetes remain more obscure. In March 2020, Dr. Bode authored a Perspective article in Science introducing a novel concept that human milk is more than just nutrition for babies, but an integral part of the mother-milk-infant 'triad', where maternal physiology, milk composition, and infant physiology form a coadapting system that is embedded in socioeconomic, cultural, behavioral, and environmental contexts. The article calls for timely investments in research designed to clarify the operations and biological effects of the mother-milk-infant triad and their translation into public health. - One week after the article was published, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic and it became strikingly evident how urgently investments in human milk research were needed. Parents and healthcare providers struggled with the complete lack of knowledge related to the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through breastfeeding and human milk as well as safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for breastfeeding women. While the teams at UC San Diego were able to respond to these crises fairly quickly [4], it highlighted the urgent need for substantial and sustainable investments in human milk research during crises and beyond. IMPLICATION : Elevating human milk research from a mere \"food for babies\" perspective to the center of maternal and infant health and fully understanding the mechanistic underpinnings of the mother-milk-infant triad holds massive opportunities for innovative approaches to better predict health outcomes, improve recommendations for preventing diseases, and develop new therapeutic targets as well as diagnostics to improve the health and development of infants, mothers and people of all ages.

How does human milk affect maternal and infant health? Mechanistic insights hold the promise of providing more informative definitions of health status, better predictions of health outcomes, improved recommendations for preventing diseases, and new therapeutic targets and diagnostics. FIGURE. 1 Not all human milk is created equal; in fact, human milk composition varies widely between women and changes over the course of lactation with potential immediate as well as long-term consequences for infant health and development. In a series of manuscripts the Bode lab and collaborators from around the world have shown that both fixed factors like maternal genetics as well as modifiable factors like maternal nutrition, exercise, health and medications influence human milk composition. Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are complex glycans, sugars,that represent the third most abundant component of human milk after lactose and lipids, and are the prime research focus of the Bode lab at UC San Diego. In a landmark article published in Nature Metabolism. Dr. Bode and collaborators at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center and the Arkansas Children's Nutrition Center have shown both in mice as well as in humans that consumption of a high-fat diet leads to a reduction of a specific milk oligosaccharide called 3'-sialyllactose. The group further identified this specific oligosaccharide as a critical mediator to improve metabolic health and cardiac function in the breastfed infant receiving the milk. The Bode lab together with collaborators at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas later confirmed in an independent study published in Scientific Reports that maternal diet affects human milk oligosaccharide composition.

Maternal Diet and Exercise Alter Human Milk Composition with Consequences for Infant Health and Development Human milk composition is not the same for all women and changes over the course of lactation. Genetics as well as modifiable factors like nutrition, exercise, use of probiotics and other supplements as well as maternal health status and use of medications call all affect milk composition. Concentrations of human milk oligosaccharides in general and 3'-sialyllactose (3'SL) in particular can change on a high-fat diet or with exercise which has been shown both in mice as well as in humans. 3'SL is a critical mediator to improve metabolic health and cardiac function in the breastfed infant, which may explain why some breastfed infants have lower risk for obesity, diabetes and cardiometabolic disease (heart attack or stroke) later in life.[ 88 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 89 ] FIGURE. 1Over 1/3 of children are overweight or obese, which is associated with numerous health and psychological comorbidities. The gold standard treatment for children with overweight or obesity is Family-Based Treatment (FBT), which includes nutrition and physical activity education, behavior therapy skills and parenting skills. Although FBT results in weight reduction, there is wide variability in treatment response, and 2/3 of children continue to struggle with overweight or obesity into adulthood. Dr. Boutelle's goal is to identify individual-level factors underlying treatment response that can be targeted to develop novel treatments. Children are born with specific appetitive traits, such as how full they feel when eating and how much they feel driven to eat when physically full. These traits interact with the current food environment and put certain vulnerable children at risk for weight gain. Dr. Boutelle and her team examined the impact of appetitive traits on weight loss success among 150 children with overweight and obesity who participated in a 6-month FBT program with their parent. Children were characterized into three groups: highly responsive to internal cues for satiety (HighSR), highly responsive to external food cues (High FR), or frequently engaging in emotional eating (HighEE). Children in each of these appetitive trait categories lost weight at a similar rate during the 6-month intervention. However, those who were highly responsive to external food cues or engaged in emotional eating regained their weight at the 12-month follow-up assessment, while children who were high on satiety responsiveness maintained their weight (see Figure 1). IMPLICATION : These study findings highlight the need for additional tailoring of current behavioral weight-loss interventions to increase long-term success for children. The Boutelle lab is currently testing a treatment, called Regulation of Cues that targets both food responsiveness and satiety responsiveness and is expected to be more effective for children who do not respond to traditional FBT.

Changes in BMIz by appetitive trajectory group.For children with overweight or obesity, parents have been identified as a key player in the success of their child. Parents who lose weight during our interventions are much more likely to have children who are also successful in weight loss. Dr. Boutelle and her team evaluated other variables, including changes in the home food environment (high fat and low-fat items), parent feeding behaviors (restriction, monitoring and perceived responsiveness), changes in parent and child intake (kcals), changes in parent nutrition knowledge, and changes in parent and child physical activity (moderate to vigorous physical activity). After controlling for parent weight loss, the parent's ability to change the home food environment, i.e., their ability to remove high-calorie items from the house and make low-fat options more available, was significantly associated with child weight loss. In addition, they found that parents who monitored their child's eating and activity behaviors were more likely to be successful during treatment (see Table 1). IMPLICATION : These results are being used to develop an FBT program that is less burdensome and focuses on these mechanisms of change.

More Perseverative ErrorsThe mission at the Center for Healthy Eating and Activity Research (CHEAR) is to: 1) develop state of the art interventions for obesity and overeating based on basic behavioral science, cognitive science, and neuroscience and to 2) develop disseminable programs to increase the reach of interventions for overweight and obesity. One-third of children are overweight or have obesity. The recommended treatment is family-based behavioral therapy, which utilizes behavioral strategies to help families increase physical activity and decrease caloric intake and implement these behavioral changes. However, the majority of families are not able to maintain these changes following completion of the program resulting in childhood obesity tracking into adulthood. Dr. Eichen and the CHEAR team seek to identify mechanisms that may impact success in current treatments that could be targeted to improve outcomes. Executive functions (EFs) are higher level cognitive functions that guide behavioral responses during complex tasks or socio-emotional situations to achieve a goal. The three main EF domains include: inhibitory control (the ability to control and regulate impulsive behaviors), working memory (the ability to hold memories in order to complete a task), and cognitive flexibility (the ability to shift thoughts in order to respond to a situation). Current treatment recommendations require significant EF; thus, it was hypothesized that executive function may impact treatment outcomes. Dr. Eichen and her team examined the impact of EF tasks on weight loss success among 150 children with overweight and obesity who participated in a 6-month weight loss program with their parent. Children who had poorer cognitive flexibility or set-shifting ability had greater weight regain at the follow-up assessment (see Figure 1). IMPLICATION : The results of this study suggest that current programs need to target EF to improve long-term maintenance of weight loss obtained during treatment. Currently, Dr. Eichen is developing programs that incorporate EF training to improve outcomes for obesity and binge eating disorder treatment. A program has been developed that targets compensatory strategies to manage EF risk factors. An evaluation of this treatment delivered to parents of children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is in progress. ADHD is associated with lower EF so combining EF training with weight loss treatment for this population has the potential to improve outcomes and allow for treatment of a population that is typically excluded from weight loss treatment.

FIGURE. 1 Chronic liver disease represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Fibrosis is an intrinsic response to chronic persistent liver injury that results in a wound-healing process to mitigate the damage but also can lead to scar formation. Unfortunately, in many instances liver fibrosis progresses over time and results in the development of cirrhosis where the normal liver parenchyma is replaced by scar tissue resulting in severe disruption of the liver architecture and vascular distortion, and is associated with feared complications including portal hypertension, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma with liver transplantation being the only curative therapeutic option. Cell death and inflammation are two central elements in the development of liver fibrosis. Investigators in Dr. Feldstein lab uncovered hepatocyte pyroptosis, a novel form of cell demise and release of inflammasome components as important mechanisms to propagate liver injury and liver fibrosis development. Experiments in cell cultures, mice, and human samples show that a specific form of cell death, called pyroptosis, leads to the release of complex inflammatory particles, the NLRP3 inflammasome, from inside hepatocytes into the extracellular space. From there they are taken up by other cells and thereby mediate inflammatory and pro-fibrogenic stress signals. The discovery of this mechanism may lead to novel treatments for chronic liver diseases in the future. IMPLICATION : Chronic Inflammation has created a global health burden and is a common driver of some of the most common diseases limiting people's health and longevity. Dissecting the molecular mechanisms driving chronic inflammation may help identified novel precision medicine approaches to treat these conditions.

FIGURE. 1[ 92 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 93 ] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, health literacy is \"the degree to which individuals have the ability to find, understand, and use information and services to inform health-related decisions and actions for themselves and others.\" In pediatrics, health literacy is essential for a smooth transfer from pediatric-centered to adult-centered care, the preparation for which is a process known as transition. Urgency to address transition readiness has been well- recognized by national health agencies because of demonstrated poor psychosocial and health outcomes in youth with poor transition experiences. Delivery of transition services needs to be integrated into clinical workflow, but this historically has been difficult to achieve because of lack of time and systematic supports. Dr. Huang and her lab, along with a multidisciplinary Transition Task Force at Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, have been evaluating the role of the electronic health record (EHR) to essentially support distribution of transition services in a manner friendly to clinical workflow. Currently, EHR-supported transition service delivery occurs annually to youth with chronic illness beginning at age 12y and involves transition readiness assessment (via a self-report checklist and practicum), shared decision making between provider and patient to determine goals for improvement in transition readiness, and familiarizing youth with their own medical history via medical summary review (See Figure). This EHR activity successfully launched in 2019 in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease specialized clinic and has expanded to addressing chronic conditions including diabetes, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, liver transplant, renal transplant, and congenital heart disease. IMPLICATION : This work enables the translation of expert- recommendations regarding transition into real world clinical care so that adolescents with chronic disease can receive transition services. With receipt of such needed services, adolescents can develop the skills and knowledge needed to become advocates for their own healthcare and improve their health outcomes. Outcomes from this body of work have been presented at national conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. Already, through increased automation and clinical decision support, feasibility of transition service delivery has not only been demonstrated in specialized clinical settings, but also in general clinical arenas. Furthermore, the transition EHR activity will be released into Epic EHR systems for universal use to expand the reach of this work to youth worldwide.

FIGURE. 1 The Transition Activity Protocol This figure demonstrates the transition activity protocol where (going left to right): assessment occurs at an annual visit at 12y-17y to inform goal setting and resource delivery regarding transition knowledge and skills to be gained prior to the next visit. In addition, a patient's medical summary is reviewed annually to familiarize the patient with his/her/their own medical history. At age 18y+, after this period of preparation, the patient then identifies an adult provider, and direct pediatric provider-to- adult provider communication occurs to ensure sharing of relevant information for continuous care delivery and appropriate transfer of care. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of liver disease in children with a prevalence in the U.S. of 5 to 8 million. NAFLD is a metabolic form of liver disease that places children at future risk for end-stage liver disease, diabetes and coronary heart disease. In April 2019, working in Dr. Jeffrey Schwimmer's lab, Dr. Yu and her team evaluated the prevalence of NAFLD in children with obesity. This study utilized magnetic-resonance imaging - proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for pediatric NAFLD and identified evidence-based diagnostic thresholds for alanine transaminase (ALT), which validates the clinical utility of ALT as a screen. Prevalence of NAFLD in children with obesity was 26%, thus demonstrating that NAFLD is indeed more common in children with obesity but NAFLD and obesity are not concomitant.

Obesity may affect vancomycin pharmacokinetics and is increasingly common among children. Dr. Khare and her research team aimed to determine if children with overweight or obesity have increased vancomycin trough concentrations with total body weight (TBW) dosing compared with children with normal weight. They conducted a search of Medline and Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations from 1952 (the year vancomycin was discovered) to November 2017. Search terms included vancomycin, body weight, and body composition terms and were limited to children. Studies were reviewed and screened by 2 reviewers. The primary outcome was vancomycin level. Data were extracted by 2 reviewers. Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. 271 records were identified. After abstract and full-text screening, Dr. Khare and her team identified 7 studies for full review. Six of the 7 studies used a matched case-control design, although there was significant variation in study methodology. Four of the 7 studies were included in a meta-analysis, which revealed a small but significant difference in vancomycin trough levels between children with normal weight and children with overweight or obesity when dosed by using TBW (N = 521; mean difference 2.2 U [95% confidence interval: 1.0-3.4]). High-quality data to guide vancomycin dosing in children with obesity are lacking. More studies evaluating dosing strategies in children with obesity are warranted because using TBW to dose vancomycin may lead to higher vancomycin concentrations and potential toxicity. IMPLICATION : This study describes the variation in vancomycin dosing by weight and examines the association between weight measures and pharmacokinetic outcomes in large, multicenter studies. Providers should be aware of the variation in pharmacokinetics by weight status to guide their dosing practice. Reference: Khare M, Azim A, Kneese G, Haag M, Weinstein K, Rhee KE, Foster BA.

Treatment programs have traditionally involved family-based behavioral therapy which promotes a range of behavioral strategies to help increase physical exercise and decrease caloric intake. However, only a third of families are able to maintain these changes over a ten-year period. In an effort to identify new targets for treatment, Dr. Rhee used the dual-process model to examine the interplay between food responsiveness (an appetitive trait) and executive functioning (cognitive traits) on obesity risk. In a study with preschool-age children, she found that those who were highly responsive to food cues (appetitive traits) had higher BMI percentiles if they had poor emotional control skills (an executive function) (Figure 1). However, children who were not highly responsive to food cues did not demonstrate this variability in weight status as executive functions differed. Dr. Rhee and her team have begun to test an intervention to promote self-regulation in preschool children and decrease consumption of energy-dense snack foods, and has obtained promising results. IMPLICATION : Focusing on executive functioning skills may enhance current behavioral weight loss programs, especially for children who are sensitive to environmental food cues.

Combination of High Food Responsiveness and Poor Emotional Control Associated with Higher BMI Percentile in Preschool Children FIGURE. 1 Relationship between emotional control and child BMI percentile among those with high or low food responsiveness or satiety responsiveness Food responsiveness and satiety responsiveness were stratified at the median and emotional control t-scores used to examine the relationship to BMI percentile among children age 4-6 years old. Poorer emotional control (higher t-score) was associated with greater BMI percentiles among those children with high levels of food responsiveness (Panel A, p=0.083, cohen's d=0.32) and low levels of satiety responsiveness (Panel D, p=0.029, cohen's d=0.35). Those with low levels of food responsiveness (Panel B, p=0.054, cohen's d= -0.21) did not have higher BMI percentiles when emotional control t-scores were high (indicating worse functioning). The relationship among those with high levels of satiety responsiveness (Panel C, p=0.19, cohen's d= -0.18) was similar to that seen among those with low food responsiveness. In addition to this work on novel targets for intervention, Dr. Rhee is working to disseminate current programs to make them more accessible to families who have a hard time attending treatment at a tertiary care academic center. She and Dr. Kerri Boutelle have developed a Guided Self-Help (GSH) model of obesity treatment that provides multi-component treatment recommended by the AAP and several other national organizations, but delivers it in individually scheduled 20-minute visits with a health coach. This program includes the same behavioral strategies that are covered in their traditional family-based behavioral program, but allows for increased flexibility in scheduling and can potentially be delivered in the primary care setting. Their recent clinical trial demonstrated similar changes in weight status as the traditional program, but had a significantly higher rate of attendance (Figure 1). IMPLICATION : Greater attendance at obesity treatment programs is the first step towards obtaining weight loss. Dissemination of this program may increase access to efficacious childhood obesity treatment for more families who are unable to attend traditional treatment programs at academic centers. By increasing access to these programs, we may be able to better treat and address the childhood obesity epidemic.

Dietary sugar is thought to be a major contributor to liver fat through de novo lipogenesis. A challenge for nutrition research has been how to test a change in a single nutrient of a free living individual's diet. Dr. Schwimmer designed a multi-center, randomized controlled trial in which the research team evaluated the entire family diet. They provided the meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking in order to replicate the family diet, with the only change being to lower the free sugar in the diet to < 3% of total calories. To measure the change in liver fat, this study also used the approach validated in the MRI Rosetta Stone Project. It was demonstrated that 8 weeks of a diet low in free sugar content, compared to a usual diet, substantially improved hepatic steatosis and liver chemistry. The improvements observed were superior to the effects observed in medication trials to date. IMPLICATION : These findings set the stage for sustainable dietary interventions to make a difference in the outcomes of children with NAFLD.

FIGURE. 1 Waterfall plot shows the change in liver fat (measured by Liver MRI-PDFF) for each individual child (low-sugar diet in blue, habitual diet in orange) from the dashed line (baseline) and after 8 weeks (circle). Liver fat decreased by 32% in the low sugar diet group compared to 5% in the habitual diet group. A growing body of literature shows the potential role of the intestinal microbiome in health and disease. Dr. Schwimmer and his team performed the most carefully phenotype case-control study of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) to date to evaluate the association of the intestinal microbiome with the risk for NAFLD and the severity of NAFLD. The development of the control group was done using advanced MRI technology developed at UC San Diego and validated in collaboration with the Schwimmer Lab (MRI Rosetta Stone Project). It was discovered that the fecal microbiomes of children with NAFLD were disrupted (dysbiosis) compared to children without NAFLD. When evaluating the relationship with disease severity, among children with NAFLD, Lactobacillus and Oribacterium were higher in patients with steatohepatitis. With respect to liver scar tissue, children with severe fibrosis were more likely to have high abundance of Prevotella. In addition, increased levels of bacterial genes that regulate synthesis of lipopolysaccharide and assembly of flagella were associated with disease severity. IMPLICATION : Through this work, Dr. Schwimmer and his team demonstrated the potential to use these biological relationships to develop clinically relevant, non-invasive biomarkers based upon the intestinal microbiome.

Patients suffer from intestinal failure necessitating parenteral nutrition and, in some cases, intestinal transplant. The diagnosis of CTE is made with the recognition of structural changes in the small intestinal epithelium. Typical findings include villous atrophy and focal epithelial tufts in the small intestine. Dr. Sivagnanam has identified mutations in the gene, EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule), contributing to the cause of this disease. In her lab, Dr. Sivagnanam is team is growing 3D \"mini guts\" to further understand how EpCAM contributes to the health of the intestine. These mini-guts, known as enteroids, possess all the cell types and architecture of the intestines. The enteroids mimic features of disease and allow for intricate study of the crypt villus axis. Thus, they serve as a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics diseases such as CTE, where structure is altered. Using this model of disease, investigators in the Sivagnanam lab have gone on to understand that EpCAM plays a role in the delicate balance of intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, with decreases in goblet, Paneth and enteroendocrine cells. They discovered that these changes can be reversed with Notch A Fine Balance Between Health and Disease MAMATA SIVAGNANAM, MD Associate Professor of Pediatrics Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition RESEARCH INTERESTS: Intestinal homeostasis through investigation of mucosal diseases of childhood.

Patients with CTE don't have treatment options currently and these new findings set the framework for new therapies to treat this devastating disease.

The ability of T cell derived TNF superfamily member LIGHT/TNFSF14 to create a transcriptional and functional inflammatory fibroblast phenotype were reported for the first time in the November 2020 issue of Gastroenterology (cover article). Human esophageal fibroblasts treated with LIGHT had enhanced a subset of LIGHT effects. LIGHT treated fibroblasts tethered human eosinophils to their surface in an ICAM-1 dependent manner. IMPLICATION: These studies place the fibroblast as potential central mediator of both inflammation and fibrosis in EoE. In other studies, the Aceves lab reported the novel experimental approach of culturing a normal esopahgeal fibroblast on the extracellular matrix from esophageal fibroblast. The EoE ECM altered the phenotype of the normal fibroblast to a higher collagen-producing myofibroblast (Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, 2021, Editor's Choice article). Using an unbiased proteomic approach, Aceves and colleagues found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) was increased in the fibroblast-derived and in vivo esophageal ECM and that TSP-1 could induce collagen production from esophageal fibroblasts.

Sequencing of patients with a B cell-restricted immunodeficiency (Hoffman syndrome), revealed autosomal dominant mutations in TOP2B. TOP2B encodes a type II topoisomerase, an essential gene required to alleviate topological stress during DNA replication and gene transcription, with no previously known role in B cell development. Dr. Broderick and her colleagues used a multi-species model approach, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to patient cells, to demonstrate that the patient mutations in TOP2B have a dominant negative effect on enzyme function, resulting in defective proliferation and survival of B cells causing a block in B cell development, and impaired humoral function in response to immunization. IMPLICATION : Topoisomerases are significant in the cancer literature; however, their involvement in primary immunodeficiency and in hematopoietic cell development has not been previously described. Thus, this discovery defined an entirely new class of B cell immunodeficiency and the first Mendelian disease due to mutations in a topoisomerase.

FIGURE. 1 Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis and Adenitis (PFAPA) syndrome is an immune disorder of childhood classically characterized by recurrent attacks of fever, pharyngitis, stomatitis, cervical adenitis and leukocytosis. Despite these unique clinical features, little is known about the underlying pathogenesis, though tonsillectomy has been suggested to be a therapeutic option. Given the location of the tonsils at the junction of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts and their inherent exposure to environmental agents, as well as recent data suggesting a role in immune tolerance, resolution of PFAPA after tonsillectomy suggests that the syndrome may represent dysregulation of the immune system. Dr. Broderick and her team reported on the clinical features of large cohort of PFAPA patients seen in a tertiary care center, their response to tonsillectomy, following this cohort for 8 years, and demonstrated a unique pro-inflammatory signature present even during the afebrile intervals, which distinguish these tissues from those from pediatric patients with recurrent pharyngitis. Furthermore, they provided the first in depth microbiome evaluation of PFAPA tonsils. IMPLICATION : This work provides clinical and translational data supporting the success of tonsillectomy as an effective surgical treatment option. The differential expression of several genes and microbial signatures suggests the potential for a diagnostic biomarker for PFAPA syndrome, and brings new insights into this often overlooked pediatric syndrome.

Dr. Coufal and her team have described the epigenetic and transcriptomic landscape of human microglia, the adequacy of current modeling techniques, and utilized bioinformatics to predict the key signaling mediators in microglial development and maturation (Figure). They are now defining how microglia in the context of genetic disease contribute to neurodevelopmental disease. To address this challenge, they have utilized patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells to generate microglia in vitro, and have developed novel methods for understanding how human microglia contribute not only to brain development but also to pediatric neuroinflammatory disease using cerebral organoids and xenotransplantation models. The ultimate goal is to understand how microglial pathology contribute to neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease and to use these models to identify, test, and validate novel treatments for disorders currently lacking in therapies. IMPLICATION: Both rare and common neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders have an inflammatory component. As the primary immune cell of the brain, microglia mediate many of these inflammatory interactions and have become as a primary treatment target in neurodegenerative disease. Dr. Coufal's studies focus on the contribution of microglia to neurodevelopment and pediatric neurodevelopmental disease with a goal of discovering novel pathways amenable to drug Pena M, Xiao J, Wu Y, Keulen Z, Pasillas MP, O'Connor C, Nickl CK, Schafer ST, Shen Z, Rissman RA, Brewer JB, Gosselin D, Gonda DD, Levy ML, Rosenfeld MG, McVicker G, Gage FH, Ren B, Glass CK.

FIGURE. 1 wild-type Ptpn6-deficientChronic inflammatory skin lesions can be disfiguring and painful, and in some cases associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmunity and leukemia. Neutrophilic dermatoses are skin lesions driven by white blood cells called neutrophils, and patients often report fever and malaise, and in some cases present with severe non-resolving skin wounds that expose underlying muscles and tendons. PTPN6 is a molecular brake that was reported to have coding and transcript variants in blood cells of patients with neutrophilic dermatoses. Mice that are defective in the PTPN6 protein also develop inflammatory skin lesions and autoimmune disease, enabling researchers to study the cellular and genetic causes of the disease. In a study published in Nature Immunology, the Croker laboratory has now revealed the molecular and cellular basis of disease, opening the door to off-the-shelf treatments for these patients. The laboratory identified a molecule called interleukin-1 (IL-1) as the key to disease but the source of IL-1 was not known. IL-1 is kept under lock-and-key by cells to prevent it from causing excessive inflammation and organ damage. During infection, immune cells can release the molecule to amplify and orchestrate immune responses. PTPN6 is one of the locks that prevent IL-1 from being released by neutrophils. The research team recognized that neutrophils can control release of IL-1 by co-opting the molecular machinery normally reserved for triggering the death of the cell. By studying mice with neutrophils that were genetically deficient in these cell death proteins, they could block the inflammatory skin disease in mice. IL-1 is still produced by neutrophils but is no longer released to drive disease. Neutrophils in this disease appear to function normally but their lifespan is very short, and they die in the wrong place at the wrong time. Neutrophils are highly toxic to pathogens because they are filled with anti-microbial compounds and inflammatory molecules including IL-1. Reference: Speir et al., Ptpn6 inhibits 2020, 21, 54-64.

Fc-specific Treg can be activated by IgG+ B cells by processing their surface IgG and presenting the Fc peptides, as well as by dendritic cells through the uptake of exogenous IgG. In Kawasaki disease, their data suggest that the expansion of these cells is one of the mechanisms of success for intravenous immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG). Functionally, this Treg population showed a capability in inhibiting the polarization of naive T cells toward a proinflammatory phenotype. Healthy adult donors have always Fc-specific Treg in circulation, which underlying their importance in the immune homeostasis, and the immunodominant Fc peptides have been found comparable in subacute KD children after IVIG and RA subjects. In acute KD this Treg population is missing before IVIG but expand because of the high concentration of IgG that leads in Treg priming. The Fc is processed presented and 186-200) can bind multiple HLA class II alleles therefore applicable as therapeutic in the general population. The success of identifying these immune modulatory pan- HLA peptides would serve as a novel therapeutic approach to treat inflammatory conditions as Rheumatoid Arthritis and Kawasaki disease (the models that have been explored). Lack of the Treg responses may have a profound impact in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory disorders as a defect of the \"central\" immune regulation that the peptide-based therapy could restore. IMPLICATION: This discovery may be an alternative to chronic administration of immune suppressive medications such as steroids by instead boosting the immune regulation. Studies are in progress for the filing of an investigator new drug (IND) for a Phase 1 in Rheumatoid Arthritis. References: Franco, A.

[ 112 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 113 ] Autoinflammatory diseases are monogenic and polygenic disorders due to dysregulation of the innate immune system. The inherited conditions have been clustered with primary immunodeficiencies in the latest practice parameters, however, these diseases have unique clinical presentations, genetics and available therapies. While there has been attention in the literature to diagnosis and treatment of rare, genetically-defined autoinflammatory disorders, physicians are challenged by increasing numbers of patients with intermittent or periodic fevers who face unnecessary morbidities due to a lack of a diagnosis. The broad differential of diseases presenting with fever includes autoinflammatory syndromes, infections associated with immunodeficiency and/or allergies complicated by infection, and less commonly, autoimmune disorders or malignancy. To address this challenge, Dr. Hoffman and his team review the history of the medical approach to fever, current diagnostic paradigms, and controversies in management. They describe the spectrum of disorders referred to a recurrent fever disorders clinic established in an Allergy/Immunology division at a tertiary pediatric care center. IMPLICATION : The Hoffman team provides practical recommendations including historical features and initial laboratory investigations that can help clinicians appropriately manage these patients, to reduce delays in diagnosis and encourage use of targeted therapies.

NLRP3 is expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and encodes a protein we termed cryopyrin, a crucial component of the inflammasome and regulator of immune mediated inflammation that has been referred to the \"Rosetta Stone of Innate Immunity.\" How varied triggers activate the NLRP3 inflammasome leading to differential immune responses has long been studied. They recently reported how different alternatively spliced NLRP3 isoforms affect inflammasome activation.

The current standard of care is limited to avoidance of the allergenic food and treatment of allergic reactions from accidental ingestion with injectable epinephrine. Peanut is among the most prevalent of the food allergies, affecting approximately 1 in 70 children and 1 in 160 adults in the United States. Peanut allergy typically begins in early childhood, but unlike many food allergies, it persists into adulthood in 80% of patients. Reactions to peanut can be triggered by milligram exposures, are frequently severe, and account for most food allergy-related deaths. Researchers have been studying oral immunotherapy (OIT) as a method to gradually desensitize patients to their food allergen with the goal of reducing reactivity. In a phase 3 peanut OIT clinical trial, peanut-allergic participants aged 4 to 55 years who reacted to 100 mg of peanut protein (approximately 1/3 of a peanut kernel) were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned, in a 3:1 ratio, to receive AR101 (a peanut-derived biologic OIT drug) or placebo. Subjects received escalating doses of peanut protein up to 300 mg per day and stayed at this maintenance dose for approximately 24 weeks. Of the 496 subjects aged 4 to 17 years on active treatment, 77% tolerated 300 mg peanut protein at the end-of-study food challenge vs. 8% on placebo; 67.2% tolerated 600 mg vs. 4% on placebo; and 50% tolerated 1000 mg vs. 2% on placebo. During the food challenge, the maximum severity of symptoms was moderate in 25% of the participants on active treatment vs. 59% of those on placebo, and severe in 5% and 11%, respectively. This trial showed that peanut OIT treatment with AR101 in children and adolescents who were highly allergic to peanut resulted in higher tolerated doses of peanut protein and in lower symptom severity at the end-of-study food challenge compared to placebo. IMPLICATION : In 2020, the first ever food allergy treatment, Palforzia \u00ae, was approved by the FDA based on the peanut OIT Phase 3 trial done here by Dr. Leonard and at other centers around the world. There is now a way to protect peanut-allergic patients against a potentially severe or life-threatening reaction after an accidental exposure. This year the new Food Allergy Immunotherapy Clinic opened at Rady Children's Hospital and this state-of-the-art food allergy treatment is now available to help protect patients and give families peace of mind. To assist other allergy centers and practices, Dr. Leonard authored a publication in the Journal of Allergy & Clinical Immunology on integrating OIT into clinical practice that will provide guidance for this new therapy for years to come.

The cachexia syndrome in CKD children consists of anorexia, reduced body and muscle mass, poor nutrition and short stature, the latter two features of which have been clearly associated with increased morbidity (hospitalization) and mortality risk. Inflammasomes are intracellular multi-protein complexes nucleated by innate immune signaling receptors such as NLRP3 (discovered by Dr. Hoffman, collaborator). NLRP3 inflammasome activation results in caspase-1 activation leading to production of IL-1\u00df and IL-18 cytokines. The Mak lab hypothesized that the primary source of these cytokines is myeloid derived circulating cells via a NLRP3 dependent mechanism. Using specific cytokine deficient mice and anakinra (recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist), Dr. Mak's research suggests that IL-1 is the most important cytokine in CKD associated cachexia. Their findings showed that IL-1 receptor antagonism by anakinra normalized food intake and weight gain, fat and lean mass content, metabolic rate, muscle function and linear growth in CKD mice. Moreover, anakinra attenuated browning of white adipose tissue in CKD mice. This was accompanied by correcting the increased muscle wasting signaling pathways while promoting the decreased myogenesis process in gastrocnemius of CKD mice. Together, these results suggest that anakinra may be a novel effective targeted therapeutic approach for cachexia in children with CKD. This work is supported by grants from the NIH (RO1DK125811) and the Cystinosis Research Foundation. IMPLICATION : There are a number of novel NLRP3 inhibitors available or becoming available. The Mak lab investigates whether these novel molecules will provide a novel unmet need for treatment of cachexia in CKD which is associated with high mortality and morbidity in CKD patients.

[ 120 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 121 ] About 3-5 percent of human proteins participate in handling drugs (e.g., ibuprofen, penicillin, antivirals, diuretics). Some years ago, Dr. Nigam and his team discovered the main kidney drug transporter, now called OAT1, as well as other members of a large family of transporters called SLC22. These are among the most important transporters of drugs in the kidney, liver, and other organs. Drug transporters are abundant in flies, worms, fish and other organisms. Thus, it is likely that their main function is something other than transporting man-made pharmaceuticals. Dr. Nigam's studies in knockout mice have begun to define \"what drug transporters really do.\" This has led to the formulation of the Remote Sensing and Signaling Theory, which proposes a central role for drug transporters in inter-organ (gut-liver-kidney) and inter-organismal (gut microbes-host) communication by small molecules. The Remote Sensing and Signaling Network consisting of over 500 genes, can be viewed a homeostatic system working in parallel with the endocrine system. One of the surprises from these omics studies of knockout mice is that OAT1 and OAT3 in the kidney are responsible for the systemic regulation of many gut microbe-derived metabolites and uremic toxins. The latter are thought to be responsible for the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD). OAT1 and OAT3 also appear to play a key role in handling lipids, uric acid, and other molecules associated with metabolic syndrome. IMPLICATION : Defining the pathways by which metabolites are transported during inter-organ communication can lead to the design of \"metabolite-like drugs\" that can target particular organs. Metabolic side effects of drugs can be diminished by considering whether drugs and metabolites compete with each other in the Remote Sensing and Signaling Network. Strategies to alter the expression or function of \"drug\" transporters may help slow down the progression of kidney disease and improve metabolic profiles in diabetes and gout.

Traditional approaches to treating the condition include prolonged mechanical ventilation and placement of a tracheostomy. Endobronchial stents have demonstrated a poor track record secondary inflammatory response, erosion into adjacent structures and occlusion. Through a well-developed collaboration between otolaryngology and cardiology, Dr. Brigger and Dr. Howaida El-Said have developed the novel application of principles of interventional cardiology into the pediatric airway. By identifying the shortcomings of traditional stents used in the airway, the team identified that the properties of specific vascular stents were better suited to the needs of the pediatric airway. In a subset of infants with severe bronchomalacia, soft coronary stents provide the physical properties that overcome many of the shortcomings of traditional stents. In particular, the radial strength combined with flexibility overcomes the limitations that previously resulted in exuberant granulation tissue and erosion into adjacent structures. Furthermore, the team's experience demonstrates the safety and ability to remove the stents up to 16 months after placement while maintaining a successful airway outcome secondary to airway remodeling a stiffening. IMPLICATION : The ability to offer airway stenting to infants with severe bronchomalacia is an important adjunct to the management of critically ill children. The ability to provide relief of bronchomalacia allows such infants to sustain lower degrees of airway support and potentially avoid tracheostomy placement. Excellent long-term outcomes have been be sustained after stent removal. References: Mittal stenting in infants Technique outcomes.

It is one of the most important joints for weight bearing and mobility. A number of common pediatric conditions including developmental dysplasia of the hip, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, slipped capital femoral epiphysis, and femoroacetabular impingement affect normal hip development and can lead to limited childhood function. Understanding the three-dimensional morphology of the acetabulum is critical for surgeons treating orthopedic hip conditions. Dr. Upasani and his team recently developed a technique to quantify the shape and volume of the acetabulum. They published the technique in the Journal of Hip Preservation Surgery in 2020. The technique gives a clear and reproducible measurement of acetabular morphology that can be directly compared with a cohort of age- and sex-matched typically developing children. This analysis has been used at Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego for the past 5 years when treating patients with pediatric hip disease and has allowed surgeons to better understand the unique pathology present in each child. This technique also allows these findings to be shared with patients and their parents to demonstrate the magnitude and location of the clinical abnormality and guide surgical corrections that can best optimize the shape and function of each individual child's hip joint. Dr. Upasani and his team have utilized this technique in a number of pediatric hip conditions. IMPLICATION : The next step in advancing the surgical management of pediatric hip diseases will be to integrate this 3D understanding of hip deformity into the operating room. Technologies that allow navigation and robotic guidance may soon become the standard of care to improve the safety and accuracy of our surgical corrections. In the meantime, Dr. Upasani and his team will continue to work to better understand the development and mechanics of the hip joint.

[ 126 ] UC SAN DIEGO & RADY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL Translating Science into Cures for Children [ 127 ] Cerebral Palsy is the most common motor disability in children with a prevalence of 3-4 children per 1000 in the United States. While it is appreciated that this disorder is secondary to an insult to the developing brain, either in-utero or in the first 2 years of life, little was known about the end-organ: muscle. With a brain injury, there is often a lack of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as GABA to modulate the reflex action of the skeletal muscles of the body. This leads to spasticity with painful spasms and eventual muscle contractures Most treatments for cerebral palsy are not focused on the brain but on treating the muscles. This can be in the form of physical therapy with muscle stretching and strengthening, oral or intrathecal GABA agonists such as baclofen or diazepam, botulinum toxin injections or selective dorsal rhizotomies to diminish spasticity and orthopedic surgery to lengthen or transfer spastic and contracted muscles. However, little was known about muscle in children with cerebral palsy. Working with one of the world's leading muscle researchers, Richard Lieber, PhD, who until recently was the Vice-Chair of Research of the Orthopedic Department of UCSD and currently the Chief Scientific Officer at the Shirley Ryan Ability Center, Dr. Chambers and Dr. Lieber's team conducted a series of studies to characterize muscle in children and young adults with cerebral palsy. Since he performs many surgeries on spastic and contracted muscle at Rady Children's Hospital they were able to obtain muscle samples. One of the challenges of studying muscle in children and adolescents is that there is little access to control samples and it is difficult to obtain these samples. Fortunately, there is a very active sports medicine practice at Rady and Dr. Chambers was able to easily obtain muscle from adolescents in whom they were performing ACL reconstructions, especially from their hamstring muscles. The findings from these studies were surprising in that the muscle shouldn't have been that different from typically developing children as there is no \"disease\" of the muscle. However, a series of investigations demonstrated that there was a direct relationship between the severity of the cerebral palsy (ambulators vs nonambulators, for example) and a multitude of muscle properties. The muscle fibers were actually longer in those children with cerebral palsy instead of shorter making them less efficient and powerful, the stiffness of the muscle was found to be secondary to increased production of collagen surrounding the muscle bundles, there were fewer satellite cells (muscle stem cells) as the severity of the disorder increased, there were changes in the enzyme activity and, there were many genes which were up- or down-regulated in all areas of the cell. IMPLICATION : This characterization of muscle and understanding of some of the pathways that spasticity affects muscle is leading to further discovery; investigating potential agents to increase satellite cell production or stem cell treatment, increase various components of muscular activity, modulate the regulation of cellular activity and small molecule research to perhaps decrease the influence the direct effect of spasticity on the muscle cell. The goal of this research is to minimize the effect of brain injury on our prime movers: our muscles. References: Number in situ in Muscular Contractures from Children with Cerebral Palsy.

Direction of growth Illustration of torsional growth modulation of the distal femur by oblique plating spanning the physis both medially and laterally. Growth from left to right line drawings, the plates straighten and cause the distal femur to twist externally with longitudinal growth resulting in a rotational correction.Dr. Edmonds and his team sought to determine if the torsional growth could be modulated based on the angles of the tension band plating and whether or not oblique plating affected overall longitudinal growth. New Zealand White rabbits either underwent sham surgery that included screw placement only, or experimental surgery with obliquely placed unlocked plates, angled from 0 to 75 degrees, fixed to the bone with screws and spanning the physis. Radiographs were taken at biweekly intervals. After 6 weeks of growth, hind limbs were harvested and microCT scans performed. Femoral length, distances between screw heads and angle between the plates were measured on radiographs. Femoral length differences were compared between groups. Femoral version was measured from 3D microCT. Plate angle changes were correlated to the difference in femoral version between limbs using Pearson correlation (significance was set to P<0.05 for all comparisons). Femur length difference between the contralateral and the operative side was significantly greater in the plate group compared with the sham group over time (P=0.049). Medial and lateral screw distances changed significantly more in the sham group than the plate group on both sides (P<0.001). A greater initial angle between plates resulted in a greater change in the angle between plates (P<0.001).

The torsional effect of oblique plating seems to correlate with the amount of initial plate angle, with an additional, not negligible, longitudinal growth effect. Therefore, placing plates at given angles across open physes may result in predictable changes in bone torsion allowing for a safer and less invasive option when treating childhood rotational deformities, but the resulting shortening of the operative femur must be considered. IMPLICATION : This study demonstrated that not only was this method feasible, but it showed that it could be done in a less invasive manner when treating rotational deformities in children. However, it was concluded that further study on an animal model was imperative before any human trials are attempted, because not only did shortening of the hind limb occur, but there were histologic changes to the orientation of the cartilage cells in the physis. Therefore, further study is warranted to examine the cellular effects on the physis and true 3D changes within the structure of the physis itself.

Little is known about outcomes or adverse events at different flow rates. The objective of this study was to examine the impact of increasing maximum flow rates on treatment failure, ICU transfer, and adverse events. Dr. Levy and his team conducted a retrospective chart review of patients age <24 months admitted to the general ward from March 2017-May 2020 with a first diagnosis of bronchiolitis treated with HFNC. During the study period, the maximum allowable HFNC flow rate increased from 6 liters per minute to 12 liters per minute. Primary outcomes were incidence of treatment failure and hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes were incidence of pressure ulcer, aspiration pneumonia, pneumothorax, and seven-day readmission. Findings showed that treatment failure decreased as maximum allowable flow rates increased. The effect was most pronounced in infants 6 kg for whom failure rates decreased from 41% at the beginning of the study period to 10% at the end. There was no increase in length of stay or incidence of adverse events. IMPLICATION : Bronchiolitis is one of the most common reasons for pediatric hospital admission. This study shows that for young infants with bronchiolitis who weigh 6 kg, high flow nasal cannula is a safe treatment that can prevent ICU admission without increasing hospital length of stay or adverse events.

To document this observation, the Mubarak team reviewed records and radiographs in 3 patient groups. They found that talocalcaneal coalitions have a bony prominence below the medial malleolus on clinical exam and not present in flatfeet or other coalitions. This abnormal middle facet is almost twice the size of the normal middle facet. If a palpable bony prominence is noted just below the medial malleolus during examination of a painful foot with a decrease in subtalar motion, the likely diagnosis is talocalcaneal coalitions based on clinical examination. With this added clinical finding, appropriate images can be ordered to confirm the diagnosis of the latter. CT scans with 3D images for surgical planning is advised. The primary finding for tarsal coalitions in textbooks is decreased subtalar motion and this is an added finding. IMPLICATION : This new finding of a palpable enlarged medial prominence just below the medial malleolus is highly associated with talocalcaneal coalitions and allows for more specific X-ray studies.

FIGURE. 1 Bony fullness or \"double medial malleolus\" over the middle facet is a consistent finding with most talocalcaneal coalitions.Prompt evaluation of a younger child (age <5) with gait disturbance or refusal to walk is necessary to distinguish orthopedic urgency (trauma or infection) from relatively benign processes, hip synovitis, and chronic problems such as arthritis. Physical examination should include evaluation of gait, supine and simulated prone hip examination (with the parent holding the child for comfort), and the crawl test. In conjunction with the detailed history, a thorough physical exam and radiographs from the orthopedic provider can determine the need for laboratory tests and other imaging. Physical examination of the limping child can be optimized by utilizing the parent holding the child chest-to-chest while the examiner moves the extremities, especially hip internal rotation, and checks the back. Asymmetric hip internal rotation likely is indicative of hip joint pathology. IMPLICATION : These new physical examination tips, prone hip examination and the crawl test, will focus the provider's X-rays orders to the appropriate region of the lower extremities.

The gold standard method for surgically correcting scoliosis remains a spinal fusion procedure in which rods and screws are used to realign the spine. The spinal fusion is accomplished by adding bone graft thus yield the region of the spine treated immobile. An option that avoids spinal fusion thus allowing some motion through the corrected region of the spine has now reached a point of routine clinical application in patients. A technique known as anterior spinal growth modulation, utilized a flexible cord attached to the spine that limits growth on the convex side of the curve while allowing growth on the concave side such that the curve resolves as the patient grows. This technique was first studied in Dr. Newton's lab over 20 years ago in several animal models. In 2 recent publications, the clinical experience with this revolutionary approach has been presented. In the most recent, the 2-5 year post-operative clinical outcomes were compared to a matched cohort of patients treated with the standard posterior fusion method. The important findings from these early clinical cases of spinal growth tethering is that spinal deformity correction without need for fusion was attainable in the majority of cases. Although the degree of scoliosis correction was less than with a posterior spinal fusion and the need for revision surgery was higher, it is clear that for some patients this is an option that permits motion preservation of the spine. There is certainly more research to be done to identify the correct timing and degree of initial correction to generate the optimal final correction. Large scale retrospective and prospective multicenter research is underway through the Setting Scoliosis Straight - Harms Study Group trials. The best clinical paper award was given to this group and Dr. Newton at the 2021 Scoliosis Research Society's International Meeting on Advanced Spine Techniques. IMPLICATION : This method has the potential to reduce the need to perform spinal fusion in patients treated for scoliosis.

This series of radiographs demonstrates the initial preoperative scoliosis of the thoracic spine (Pre) and subsequent correction following anterior spinal growth modulation with a tether. After anterior spinal tether placement (a radiolucent cord is connected between the vertebral body screws) there is modest correction seen in the \"Post\" image. The 1 and 2 year post-surgery images demonstrate the continued reduction of the scoliosis that has been driven by growth of the spine. The correction has been largely maintained at 3 and 5 years after surgery once growth was finished.FIGURE. 1 Medial epicondyle fractures are common fractures that occur about the elbow in children. This fracture is typically an avulsion of the medial epicondyle with the attachment of the common flexors of the forearm of the through its apophysis from the medial distal humerus. The most common method of fixation for displaced medial epicondyle fractures is with the use of a screw. However, younger patients have a smaller fracture fragment that may not be able to accommodate a screw due to their size and minimal ossification. Younger patients with displaced medial epicondyle fractures are treated with Kirschner wires (K-wires) or suture anchors as alternative options. The three fixation methods were evaluated for their biomechanical properties, clinical outcomes, cost and complications for patients 10 years of age or younger. The biomechanical assessment was performed using immature pig forelimbs. An osteotomy was created through the medial epicondyle apophysis to simulate a fracture that were fixed with each of the fixation methods: screw, K-wires or suture anchors. The biomechanical properties were tested using an MTS machine evaluating for: cyclic elongation (mm), displacement (mm), load to failure (N), and stiffness (N/mm). Biomechanically, screw fixation proved to be stronger (P=0.047) and stiffer (P=0.01) than the K-wire or suture anchor constructs. Screw, K-wire and suture anchor fixation were all found to be acceptable methods for displaced medial epicondyle fractures as the forces used to test the constructs exceeded the forces observed across the elbow joint with typical range of motion. The clinical assessment was completed by retrospective review of patients 10 years of age or younger with a medial epicondyle fracture fixed with these three strategies. The complications, radiographic and postoperative outcomes were compared and were to complete a cost-analysis of each fixation method. All (100%) of the 51 fractures reviewed healed independent of the fixation method. K-wires were used as fixation for younger patients (p<0.05). Screw fixation was found to have the shortest duration of casting (3 weeks, p=0.02). All three groups had similar clinical outcomes and complications although a second surgery for implant removal was less likely in the suture anchor group (p<0.05). The decreased incidence of reoperation rate translated to a 10% cost-savings for the suture anchor group. IMPLICATION : All three methods of fixation are biomechanically and clinically appropriate for fixation of displaced medial epicondyle fractures in children. Screw fixation provides the strongest, stiffest construct with the shortest duration of immobilization but the added cost of frequent reoperation due to symptomatic implants. K-wires and suture anchors are a suitable alternative clinically and biomechanically to screws for small or comminuted displaced medial epicondyle Biomechanical Evaluation and Clinical Comparison of Three Fixation Methods Used in Pediatric Patients.

The decision as to whether to continue these drugs throughout the perioperative period is difficult and must be based on the balance between hemorrhagic and thrombotic risk. To help guide strabismus surgeons with clinical management in these cases, Dr. Robbins and her team reviewed the literature for potential hemorrhagic complications of strabismus surgery and examine the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during the perioperative period. (See Fig 1). Surgical strategies that might help minimize intraoperative hemorrhage in patients on anticoagulant therapy are also discussed.

For more than 3 decades, treatment of severe ROP that markedly decreases the incidence of this poor visual outcome has been available. However, severe, treatment-requiring ROP must be diagnosed in a timely fashion to be treated effectively. The sequential nature of ROP requires that infants who are at-risk and preterm be examined at proper times and intervals to detect the changes of ROP before they become destructive. This statement presents the attributes of an effective program to detect and treat ROP, including the timing of initial and follow-up examinations.

FIGURE. 1 California hot spots for perforated appendicitis, 2005-2015. Perforated appendicitis is a well-documented child health disparity. Geographic patterns in perforated appendicitis exist in several United States regions, but such patterns had not yet been described in California. Drs. Schwartz and Nguyen aimed to analyze spatial-temporal patterns of pediatric perforated appendicitis and identify population characteristics contributing to these cluster patterns. Risk-adjusted perforated appendicitis rates per 1000 appendicitis cases in patients 1-17 years from 2005-2015 in California were geocoded and a space-time cube analysis was performed to identify hot spot trends. Drs. Schwartz and Nguyen performed logistic regression to estimate rural classification associated with spatial-temporal hot spots and multivariate analysis to assess effects of socioeconomic factors. In 2005-2015, 43,888 cases of pediatric perforated appendicitis occurred in California. The median risk-adjusted perforated appendicitis rate was 312 per 1000 appendicitis cases. Eleven spatial-temporal hot spots of perforated appendicitis were identified (see Figure 1). Rural micropolitan counties had 14 times higher odds of being classified as a hot spot (p<0.05, 95% CI 1-185). Poverty was a significant predictor of high perforated appendicitis median risk-adjusted rate (p<0.004). IMPLICATION : This work highlights the importance of geographic location in pediatric health. Using space-time analysis, we gained insight on how rural living and poverty might impact pediatric appendicitis outcomes. Incorporating the role of geography alongside an understanding of socioeconomic factors is a critical step in addressing this important child health disparity. Reference: Schwartz K, Nguyen MB.

A variety of debilitating clinical conditions, including stroke, multiple sclerosis, head trauma, spinal cord trauma, and cerebral palsy can cause hypertonicity. Untreated symptoms can become permanently disabling, causing severe bone/joint deformities and reduction in joint biomechanical range of motion. The evaluation of spasticity severity level is a critical step in selecting appropriate treatments for patients. The lack of an objective measurement limits understanding and advancements in this area. Dr. Skalsky and a team of engineers at the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering designed an instrumented glove system to measure the severity of hypertonicity in patient's spastic limbs. This device introduces the use of frequency modulation (FM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM) to improve multi-sensor signal acquisition with collocated sensors. As illustrated below, the spastic muscles were measured when the patient was i) fully awake, ii) being induced under anesthesia, iii) under full anesthesia. Anesthesia greatly reduces spasticity. The electronic glove system measured a significant increase in the force applied while awake versus under anesthesia indicating increased resistance in the patient's muscle. This demonstrates that the glove system can differentiate measurements of physical attributes related to normal and spastic states of the muscle groups involved. IMPLICATION : This novel approach by using a sensor-filled glove enables a high interrater reliability and removes the observer bias that can stem from subjective assessments. This should result in more sensitive and objective spasticity assessments that can be done by clinicians, caregivers or researchers with high-caliber reproducible data. Such a discovery of an objective measurement can dramatically improve the accuracy in tracking patient's response to therapy to likely reveal fine-level changes that are not currently observable and lessen the healthcare burden cost by imprecise medication adjustments based on subjective models. Dr Skalsky's team envisions this revolutionary quantitative tool to help in enhancing feasibility of studies that can bring more robust and valuable advancements to the field and most importantly to improve patient's quality of life with an objective outcome measures in clinical research looking at spasticity and its treatment.

Non-opioid pain management is a common postoperative strategy after penile surgery, but literature describing this is sparse. Dr. Swords and her team sought to describe their experience performing complex penile surgery with vs without post-operative opioids. A retrospective review was performed of the institution's penile surgeries performed by four current attending surgeons, including 3998 surgeries between 2009-2019. Patients identified were <8 years of age who underwent outpatient penile surgery requiring either penile degloving for correction of an anomaly or any variation of a hypospadias repair. One provider was compared to the others to associate the practice of prescribing no opioids vs routine prescription. Patients were matched 1:1 by age and type of penile surgery. Baseline features and post-operative outcomes were examined. The primary outcome of interest was post-op encounters related to pain, delayed opioid prescription, and predictors of pain complaint on multivariate analysis. 200 children were identified, 100 per group, matched with both groups' mean age 1.3\u00b10.8 years. 48% of each group were penile degloving procedures, 31% hypospadias repairs with tubularization/catheter placement, and the remaining 21% were hypospadias repairs without catheter placement. Patients receiving opioids received a mean 12.5 doses. OR time, concomitant surgery, caudal use, and 30-day complications were comparable between groups (P>0.05). 59(59%) of patients without opioids had an impromptu post-operative encounter vs 41% of those prescribed opioids, and 20% had an associated pain complaint vs 9% (p=0.026). 2 patients in both the non-opioid and opioid groups received a delayed opioid prescription(p=1.00), as most pain complaints were managed with non-opioid strategies. Assessing all baseline and perioperative features, it was found that the presence of a catheter (OR 2.9) and no opioid prescription (OR 2.6) were independent predictors for post-operative pain complaint. Patients discharged without an opioid were more likely to contact a provider postoperatively, and were more likely to endorse a concern of pain, but rarely required a delayed opioid prescription as most patients found relief with non-opioid measures. IMPLICATION : As the opioid crisis continues to progress, it is vital to scientifically examine the need for post-operative opioid analgesics and reduce or discontinue their use when able. This study demonstrates the decreased need for opioids in a complex penile surgery, which was previously thought to require regular opioid prescription.

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) do not require injections or lab monitoring. Dr. Thornburg participated in a think tank to consider the optimal use in children and is evaluating the DOACs in children with blood clots. She was the principal investigator at Rady Children's Hospital San Diego for an international randomized open label phase three clinical trial of rivaroxaban versus standard of care anticoagulation in children, 0-17 years of age, with venous thromboembolism, Einstein-Jr. This was the largest study of a blood thinner in children (N= ~500). Three hundred twenty-nine received at least one dose of dose-adjusted rivaroxaban, in tablets or suspension, and one hundred sixty-two received at least one dose of standard of care anticoagulation. Symptomatic recurrence of venous thromboembolism occurred in 1% of those who received rivaroxaban and 3% who received standard anticoagulation. On repeat imaging of the thrombus, rivaroxaban was associated with decrease in thrombus burden compared to standard of care anticoagulation. Major bleeding was rare. Overall, the results of the study show that the medication is safe and effective in children, and the results will likely lead to FDA approval of the medication for children and adolescents. The new drug application for this indication was submitted in June 2021. Dr. Thornburg and pediatric colleagues in the Venus Thromboembolism Network US (VENUS) are collecting real-world safety and effectiveness data on use of DOACs in children.

Investigators in Dr. Gleeson's lab identified a new pleiotropic human multiorgan condition caused by deficient Wnt secretion. Wnts are secreted proteins involved in cell fate decisions. Patients missing the WLS gene showed microcephaly, defects in heart, kidney and hair. Patient cells showed global Wnt attenuation. Defects observed in mouse models could be prevented with a drug administered during pregnancy to boost Wnt levels. This exciting work suggests some structural birth defect might be preventable if caught early. Dr. Gleeson and his team have also been studying ways to prevent pediatric brain disease by preventing mutations in the first place. In previous work, Dr. Gleeson reported that mutations in the sperm of healthy men could cause disease in their children. The team has shown that these potential disease-causing mutations are identified in sperm from both young and old men. They found that 1 in 15 men are predicted to carry a mutation in sperm that could cause disease, and Pediatric Brain Disease Genetics Sperm clonal mosaicism is detected in 1:15 men in approximately 5% of sperm and can lead to conceptions that are incompatible with life or cause disease in children. Such disease could be prevented by carrier screening in men prior to conception.that these mutations likely arise when the father was an embryo. IMPLICATION : These clonal sperm mosaic mutations are incredibly stable over time, and predict that carrier screening could reduce the burden of disease in children.

Microtubules are integral to the normal function of healthy cells. In the nervous system, neurons rely on the microtubule cytoskeleton to form the synaptic connections where information is transferred from a neuron to its target. Microtubule growth and stability must be carefully balanced for proper synaptic development. In their studies, Dr. Wildonger and her team uncovered a new mechanism that regulates microtubule growth. They found that an enzyme called a-tubulin acetyltransferase (aTAT) has a surprising enzyme-independent role in restraining microtubule dynamics in neurons. Loss of aTAT results in the overgrowth of synaptic connections during development. The new model generated from this work is that non-enzymatic aTAT activity regulates the remodeling of microtubule networks to generate proper synaptic connections. IMPLICATION : Neurological disease impacts the health of nearly 100 million Americans yearly, making it essential to increase our understanding of how neurons achieve their proper shape and function. Many neurodevelopmental and degenerative diseases arise from perturbing the microtubule cytoskeleton. Through these studies, Dr. Wildonger and her team have uncovered a new mechanism that regulates the balance of stable and dynamic microtubules at synapses; in the future, this knowledge may be leveraged to advance innovative treatments of diseases associated with microtubule dysfunction.

Although opioids have been well studied in general, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which opioids affect human fetal brain development has not been well understood. In this work, we have taken advantage of a human 3D-brain cortical organoid (hCO) that facilitated enormously the investigation of early human brain development. Using imaging, immunofluorescence, multi-electrode array (MEA) and patch clamp recording techniques, they have investigated the effect of methadone, a frequently used opioid during pregnancy, on early neural development, including neuronal growth, neural network activity and synaptic transmission in hCOs. Their results demonstrated that methadone dose-dependently halted the growth of hCOs and induced organoid disintegration after a prolonged exposure. In addition, methadone dose-dependently suppressed the firing of spontaneous action potentials in hCOs and this suppression could be reversed upon methadone withdrawal in hCOs treated with lower dosages. Further investigation using patch clamp whole cell configuration revealed that, at clinically relevant concentrations, methadone decreased the frequency and amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic currents in neurons, indicating a critical role of methadone in weakening synaptic transmission in neural networks in hCOs. In addition, methadone significantly attenuated the hCOs. They concluded that methadone interrupts neural growth and function in early brain development. IMPLICATION : Understanding the deleterious effect of opioids on fetal brain development will be critical for better treatment of mother and fetus when pregnant women are exposed (whether for treatment or abuse) to methadone or other opioid forms.

Most of the comparative genetics between archaic and modern humans has been on introgressed sites, genome regions where modern humans have adopted archaic elements via ancestral interbreeding and admixture. Dr. Muotri and his team performed a comprehensive analysis of genetic variation available from diverse modern human populations, revealing that only 61 non-synonymous, derived coding variants are fixed or nearly fixed in extant humans and human-specific. Of these candidates, the Neuro-Oncological Ventral Antigen 1 (NOVA1) is a disease-related RNA binding protein that contains a nearly fixed, derived non-synonymous change not seen in the Neanderthal or Denisovan genomes. To study the functional significance of NOVA1 amino acid change in humans, the modern human NOVA1 was replaced with the ancestral allele in pluripotent stem cells. The stem cells were then differentiated into functional cortical organoids. The \"archealization\" of NOVA1 in brain organoids led to early excitatory synaptic maturation. Neurodevelopmental differences between species are essential components in evolutionary studies, as small changes in the timing of development can often turn into functional implications. IMPLICATION : The systematic understanding of human brain evolution using this novel \"archealization\" strategy might change our ability to understand and treat human-specific neurological disorders. Our unique cognitive capabilities likely came as evolutionary trade-offs. Thus, just as understanding the evolutionary history of bipedalism has contextualized the hernias, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, spine disorders, osteoarthritis, uterine prolapse, and difficult childbirth experienced by humans today, so too will understanding the evolutionary history of brain development illuminate conditions, such as autism, schizophrenia, speech and language disorders, learning disabilities among others.

COVID-19, the disease caused by the pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is primarily regarded as a respiratory infection. Yet the virus has also become known for affecting other parts of the body in ways not as well understood, sometimes with longer-term consequences such as heart arrhythmia, fatigue and \"brain fog.\" The Rana lab uses stem cell-derived organoids \u2014 small balls of human cells that look and act like mini-organs in a laboratory dish \u2014 to study how the virus interacts with various organ systems and develop therapies to block infection. They have found that SARS-CoV-2 doesn't infect the entire body in the same way because in different cell types, the virus triggers the expression of different genes, leading to different outcomes. Like many organs, lung and brain organoids produce the molecules ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which sit like doorknobs on the outer surfaces of cells. SARS-CoV-2 grabs these doorknobs with its spike protein, as a means to enter cells and establish infection. Dr. Rana and his team developed a pseudovirus \u2014 a noninfectious version of SARS-CoV-2 \u2014 and labeled it with green fluorescent protein, or GFP, and bright molecule derived from jellyfish that helps researchers visualize the inner workings of cells. The fluorescent label allowed them to quantify the binding of the virus' spike protein to ACE2 receptors in human lung and brain organoids, and evaluate the cells' responses. They generated LORGs containing epithelial cells, alveolar type 1 and type 2, highly express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, they observed 10-fold more ACE2 and TMPRSS2 receptors and correspondingly much higher viral infection in lung organoids, as compared to brain organoids.

Although the precise function of sleep in humans remains unclear, there are several studies that have associated sleep deprivation and/or disordered sleep to abnormal physical and mental health as well as child development. Sleep disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent condition affecting 2-10% of all children. OSA manifests as recurrent upper airway obstruction during sleep which culminates in cortical arousals and/or aberrations in gas exchange including episodic oxyhemoglobin desaturations. In children, OSA is associated with neurocognitive dysfunction, inattention, hyperactivity, school problems, depressed mood and reduced quality of life. Recent evidence has also emerged that implicates OSA and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in children. In adults, OSA may cause hypertension, with modest effects of OSA treatment. In children, CVD may not be as apparent, which likely reflects the overall increased capacitance of the cardiovascular system of young children. Dr. Bhattacharjee's work to date has evaluated dysfunction in the vascular endothelium. The endothelial layer is considered frontline in vascular integrity, and likely endothelial dysfunction is the earliest manifestation of CVD. Dr. Bhattacharjee's discovered that a severity dependent association of OSA with endothelial dysfunction exists in children, with more severe OSA having greater endothelial dysfunction. Recently, Dr. Bhattacharjee's lab in collaboration with the Dr. John Shyy lab has demonstrated that endothelial specific microRNA (miR92a) is associated with OSA severity in both children and adults, and may represent a novel biomarker of OSA mediated CVD. IMPLICATION: The implications of Dr. Bhattacharjee's research are that early onset CVD, in the form of endothelial dysfunction, occurs in childhood. As CVD remains one of the leading causes of mortality in the United States, recognition of CVD in children is paramount, as early prevention and treatment, including treating OSA, may have long term ramifications. The Bhattacharjee lab is now exploring the implications for OSA treatment, namely positive airway pressure, to restore endothelial dysfunction and other complications related to pediatric OSA.

The respiratory system is vital for survival, supplying oxygen to support all other organ systems in the body. Chronic respiratory conditions across the human lifespan place an enormous burden on healthcare systems, and respiratory diseases are among the leading causes of global death and disability. Surprisingly, a great deal about the cellular heterogeneity of the lungs and the function of different cell types remain unknown. Recent exponential improvements in nucleic acid sequencing at the single cell level (e.g., single cell RNA-seq) have ignited collaborative efforts to redefine cellular profiles comprising human organs and tissues. The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is a global initiative to produce healthy reference maps of all cell types in the human body, providing an essential roadmap to further explore the biology of disease and identify new therapeutic targets. Dr. Duong is a co-Principal Investigator for the Human Lung Cell Atlas 1.0. At the beginning of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the HCA community quickly leveraged single cell transcriptomic and epigenomic datasets to identify cell types likely to facilitate viral entry, as well as molecular pathways amenable to therapeutic intervention. In the lung, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and accessory proteases (TMPRSS2 and CTSL) are co-expressed in specific subsets of respiratory epithelial cells in the nasal passages, airways, and alveoli associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis. Additionally, as part of the NIH Human BioMolecular Atlas Program, Dr. Duong is involved in producing a multi-omic and spatial reference atlas of healthy young adult and older adult airways and lung parenchyma.

Despite advancement in treatment options such as biologics, effective therapy remains elusive for many patients. Contributing to this clinical limitation is incomplete knowledge of asthma etiology, especially on how allergen is sensed by the lung, leading to immune and lung physiological responses. Investigators in the Sun lab identified a rare cell airway cell type called pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs). These are unusual airway surface cells that had a duo characteristics of epithelium and neural cells. They are strategically enriched at airway branchpoints where inhaled particles carrying signals such as allergen are enriched. In response to allergen, PNECs are activated to secrete neuropeptides and neurotransmitters. These potent bioactive molecules signal to underlying residential immune cells such as innate lymphoid group 2 cells (ILC2s) to trigger their production of Th2 cytokines such as IL5. This leads to a cascade of recruitment of Th2 cells and eosinophils, key immune cells of the allergen-triggered immune response. The Sun lab team found that blocking PNECs or their secretion of neuropeptides dampened allergen response, with the highest effectiveness in early postnatal stage. IMPLICATION : These landmark findings suggest PNECs and the neuropeptides that they produce as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of asthma.

However, the responsiveness to ICS varies greatly among individuals. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been lauded for their prognostic utility. We hypothesized that circulating miRNAs obtained at baseline/prerandomization in the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) could serve as biomarkers and biologic mediators of ICS clinical response over the 4-year clinical trial period. Dr. Tantisira and his team selected baseline serum samples from 462 CAMP subjects subsequently randomized to either ICS (budesonide) or placebo. Samples underwent small RNA sequencing, and read counts were normalized and filtered by depth and coverage. Linear regression was used to associate miRNAs with change in FEV1% (prebronchodilator FEV1 as a percent predicted) over the 4-year treatment period in both main effects and interaction models. They validated the function of the top associated miRNAs by luciferase reporter assays of glucocorticoid-mediated transrepression and predicted response to ICS through logistic regression models. Seven miRNAs were identified significantly associated with FEV1% change (P 0.05) and 15 miRNAs with significant interaction (P 0.05) to ICS versus placebo treatments. Three miRNAs were designated for functional validation, of which hsa- miR-155-5p and hsa-miR-532-5p were significantly associated with changes in dexamethasone-induced transrepression of NF-k B. Combined, these two miRNAs were predictive of ICS response over the course of the clinical trial, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86. IMPLICATION : Two functional circulating miRNAs were identified as predictive of asthma ICS treatment response over time. Since these miRNAs were also associated with cellular response of the glucocorticoid receptor, they may also represent therapeutic targets. Dr. Tantisira's lab is pursuing similar prognostic models using miRNAs and other genomic platforms, and has recently published a long term prognostic model related to which children will undergo asthma remissions by adulthood (PMID: 32888944).

Starting with the preclinical studies [1], they translated this project to the clinic by performing the work necessary for an investigational new drug application (IND) and received FDA-approval for a phase I/II clinical trial in December 19, 2018. They started the clinical trial at UC San Diego in July 2019 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTNS-RD-04. Three patients have been infused so far. Preliminary data are encouraging as white blood cell cystine and tissue cystine crystals have been shown to be decreased in the treated patients. The extent of efficacy of HSPCs to rescue cystinosis was surprising especially considering that cystinosin is a transmembrane lysosomal protein. Dr. Cherqui and her team demonstrated that the mechanism of action involved the differentiation of HSPCs into macrophages that transferred cystinosin-bearing lysosomes via tunneling nanotubes [2]. Their study is the first demonstration of cross-correction in the context of a lysosomal transmembrane protein after HSPC transplantation suggesting that HSPC gene therapy strategy could be applied to other lysosomal disorders. They confirmed this hypothesis in Danon disease, a lysosomal disorder due to the dysfunction of the Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein type-2 (LAMP-2), leading to heart failure. IMPLICATION : This project demonstrates that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) transplantation could reverse progressive tissue injury in multiple compartments, even in the context of an intracellular membrane protein as opposed to secreted enzymes. This led to the first-in-human HSPC gene therapy clinical trial for cystinosis, and the underlying mechanism of action is expected to have implications beyond cystinosis, with potential applications to other genetic diseases with systemic defects and transmembrane organelle proteins.

Frataxin is a mitochondrial iron-binding protein. FRDA is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, often associated with cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. FRDA's pathogenesis is primarily caused by degeneration of the sensory neurons within dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Ultimately patients require the use of a wheelchair for mobility and often die from the cardiomyopathy. There is no effective treatment for FRDA. Because Dr. Cherqui and her team showed that HSPC transplantation could rescue multi-organ failure in cystinosis via the differentiation of HSPC into macrophages that could transfer organelles such as lysosomes and mitochondria to the diseased cells via tunneling nanotubes, they tested HSPC transplantation FRDA in the mouse model. It was found for the first time that transplantation of wildtype HSPC led to the complete rescue of the neurologic and muscular complications of FRDA [1]. Degeneration of large sensory neurons in the DRGs was prevented as well as the mitochondrial dysfunction in brain and muscle. For future clinical application, the goal is to develop an ex vivo gene-corrected autologous HSPC transplantation for FRDA. The Cherqui lab thus optimized a targeted genome editing approach using CRISPR/Cas9 in patients' CD34+ HSPCs to remove the hyper-expansion mutation leading to restoration of frataxin expression and mitochondrial function [2]. This represents the manufacturing feasibility of the human product, which is the first step towards a clinical translation of this strategy for FRDA.The Cherqui lab also demostrated that the mechanism underlying the rescue of FRDA by HSPCs involved the differentiation of HSPCs into microglial cells in the brain and spinal cord, and macrophages in DRGs, heart and skeletal muscle leading to the transfer of frataxin mitochondrial protein to the diseased neurons and myocytes. They are now investigating in vitro and in vivo if the entire the mitochondria are transferred in this context. These studies will be particularly interesting for the nervous system for which intercellular communication and mitochondrial exchange in the complex neuronal/microglia network might be demonstrated. IMPLICATION : These results represent the first demonstration of complete phenotypic rescue of Friedreich's ataxia following HSPC transplantation, and the development of a gene-corrected HSPC approach using CRISPR/Cas9 technology for future clinical application. These results also suggest that mitochondrial cross-correction from HSPC-derived phagocytic cells may be the mechanism of rescue, opening new perspectives in the treatment of Friedreich's ataxia and other S.

Dr. Leibel and her team are now studying the metabolic changes that occur in endodermal and lung cell differentiation in the setting of SFTPB mutation to identify biomarkers that may be useful in detecting the level of lung under-development in the extreme preterm infant. She is also using her mini lungs to understand the metabolism of surfactant and lamellar bodies to determine signalling molecules that may be harnessed to improve surfactant production and secretion. IMPLICATION : The implications for Dr. Leibel's research lie in their translational applications in term babies born with genetic surfactant mutations to bypass the need for lung transplantation by differentiation lung cells from their genetic backgrounds and replacing abnormal lung cells with their own iPSC derived lung cells with an intact surfactant system. This system can also be used to improve endogenous surfactant production and secretion in preterm babies to reduce their risk of chronic lung disease.

FIGURE. 1Surfactant protein B deficiency results in respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn. The lungs are unable to exchange gas and the newborns are ventilator dependent and die unless they get a lung transplantation. This fatal disease is a result of a simple frameshift mutation which can be altered through gene therapy. The objective of Dr. Leibel's study was to use induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that were reprogrammed from fibroblasts of a patient with surfactant protein B (SFTPB) deficiency and study the gene and protein expression changes throughout the stages of endoderm and early lung development using a novel 3D organoid differentiation protocols. Data analysis demonstrated that this mutation impacted the expression of key proximal and distal lung epithelial cells compared to the wild type iPSC derived lung organoids. Dr. Leibel then transfected the mutant iPSCs with a lentivirus carrying the wild type SFTPB gene and showed wild type expression of proximal and distal surfactant associated genes, proteins and lamellar bodies and rescued functional surfactant secretion. Dr Leibel was one of the first to show the phenomenon of SFTPB protein expression only in the 3D lung organoid, and not in endoderm development. Despite robust SFTPB gene expression in the rescued iPSC and early endodermal differentiation, protein expression was not detected until the 3D lung organoids were formed.

FIGURE. 1 The focus for Dr. Polk and his team for three decades has been to better understand intestinal development and repair processes that could translate to new therapies and prevention strategies for ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, the two most common inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). These are chronic diseases characterized by intestinal inflammation, ulceration and the progression of intestinal injury from incomplete or abnormal repair. Mouse models have provided important clues about the genetics, immunology, intestinal microbiome and the environment in the causes and potential prevention and treatment approaches. However, very little is known about the cells contributing to ulcer repair in these diseases. In a recent publication, featured by the journal, Dr. Polk and his team compared a variety of IBD models for their stem cells involved in repair. Their findings advance the field in several ways. First, this is the first comparison of stem cell lineages in repair of different models of colitis. Second, they identified novel inflammatory expression patterns across these models of colitis and lastly, these findings show distinct patterns of stem cell induction in response to different causes of colitis. This work advances the field by defining new targets for cellular therapy in repair of intestinal ulceration seen in IBD. Intestinal stem cells responsible for day-to-day maintenance on the lining of the intestine express the marker Lgr5. Based on prior work it was thought that these cells were temporarily lost during colitis. Using four different models of colitis in mice, Dr. Polk and his team showed that only in one of those models were the stem cells completely lost, but not the other three. Using a novel approach to address the importance of Lgr5+ cells in repair they deleted these cells using diptheria toxin and showed that during chronic inflammation they limit the amount of inflammation and injury but had no effect on limiting acute ulceration, which was repaired by a cell population previously described during intestinal development but thought to be absent in adolescent and adult animals. Thus, the Lgr5+ stem cell is differentially lost during different causes of colitis and shows previously unknown regulation of inflammation during chronic colitis, that is seen in human IBD. The next steps for these studies will be to understand why the different choice of stem cells is necessary and how to expand them during colitis as a novel therapy. IMPLICATION : New therapies have been developed for human ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease over the past 25 years all of which have targeted suppressing the immune system. These findings provide preclinical evidence of epithelial cell targets to promote ulcer repair in IBD.

For the pancreatic lineage, protocols have been developed to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into pancreatic endocrine and exocrine cells through intermediates resembling in vivo development. In recent years, this differentiation system has been employed to decipher mechanisms of pancreatic development, congenital defects of the pancreas, as well as genetic forms of diabetes and exocrine diseases. Dr. Sander and her team summarized recent insights gained from studies of pancreatic hPSC models. They discuss how genome-scale analyses of the differentiation system have helped elucidate roles of chromatin state, transcription factors, and noncoding RNAs in pancreatic development and how the analysis of cells with disease-relevant mutations has provided insight into the molecular underpinnings of genetically determined diseases of the pancreas.
