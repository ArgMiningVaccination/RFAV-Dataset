While all of these products have the potential to be beneficial, natural products are generally the better choice of the two. Wondering why this is? Looking for some reasons to use natural skin care products? Here are 6 of them. 1. They're Better for the Environment Simply put: [natural skincare products](https://squirrelsnutbutter.com/collections/skin-restoration/products/sariah-rose-body-butter) are better for the environment than are synthetic skincare products. The reasons for this are numerous. First and foremost, synthetic chemicals have the potential to harm animals and plants with which they come into contact. Should the synthetic chemicals from a synthetic product seep into the ground, they could have dire consequences on surrounding ecosystems. Secondly, the processes associated with manufacturing traditional skincare products put a great deal of stress on the environment. This is because the extraction of certain ingredients (aluminum, lead, etc.) requires mining. Mining produces a great deal of pollution, ultimately leaving a negative [carbon footprint](https://timeforchange.org/what-is-a-carbon-footprint-definition) on the environment at large. Natural skincare products forego the use of such ingredients, and so don't necessitate mining. And because they use only natural ingredients, they cause no harm to the surrounding plants and animals. 2. They're Safer When compared to synthetic skincare products, natural skincare products are much safer. This is because the ingredients contained within natural products are much safer than those contained in synthetic products. See, when a lotion is applied to the skin, the ingredients contained within it slowly sink into the bloodstream. From there, they have a direct effect on many of the body's processes. If the ingredients are beneficial, they'll have beneficial effects. If, on the other hand, they're a detriment, they'll have adverse effects on the body. So, by using a natural skincare product as opposed to a synthetic one, you are essentially avoiding all negative health effects. This will result in you feeling better and looking better. 3. Their Manufacture Doesn't Harm Animals You might be shocked at how many skincare product manufacturers test their products on animals. [A good many](https://www.peta.org/living/personal-care-fashion/beauty-brands-that-you-thought-were-cruelty-free-but-arent/) of the big names in the industry continue to do so, to the obvious detriment of the animals which are being tested on. The good news is that natural skincare product manufacturers forego animal testing, and, in fact, do nothing to harm other living beings. In this sense, they are more ethical and more empathetic than a good many of the synthetic brands. If you're against animal testing and for the humane treatment of animals, natural skincare products are the best way to go. They will prevent you from contributing to harmful and malicious practices. 4. They're Packed with Beneficial Nutrients The most poignant way to highlight the differences between synthetic and natural skincare products is to discuss their ingredients. The ingredient profiles of the two types of products are wildly different, to the point that they don't even resemble similar products. When you look at the ingredient label on a synthetic product, you'll see words such as Triclosan, Glyceryl Stearate, Dye #4, and Petrolatum. These ingredients are made in labs, and, while capable of performing their function, can be detrimental to the body. Natural products, on the other hand, are filled with familiar-sounding ingredients such as jojoba oil, argan oil, apple juice, lemon juice, and so on and so forth. These ingredients are not only not harmful to the body, but they're actually beneficial, in fact. This is due to the fact that they contain vitamins and compounds such as Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Resveratrol, alpha-hydroxy acid, and more, all of which help the body to function at optimal levels. 5. They're Easier on the Skin One of the biggest problems with synthetic skincare products is that they're harmful to some individuals' skin. Certain ingredients contained within these products can cause everything from swelling to redness to itchiness to outright allergic reaction. For this reason, they're better avoided altogether. Ingredients to look out for include parabens, sulfates, petrochemicals, synthetic dyes, propylene glycol, and triclosan. However, it's important to note that some other synthetic chemicals can cause this problem as well. This is why it's generally a better idea to opt for natural products. Natural products are free of irritants, and, instead of being a detriment to the skin, they are actually beneficial to it. 6. They Leave No Doubt About Your Health At the present time, there is a great deal of controversy surrounding the ingredients used in synthetic skincare products. While some believe these ingredients to be safe, others are skeptical, citing the fact that very little independent research has been done on them. So, in essence, by using synthetic skincare products, you're throwing caution to the wind. For all you know, you're allowing harmful chemicals to seep into your bloodstream. In the long-run, this could have dire consequences. The question you have to ask yourself is: are you comfortable gambling on your health? Is it worth it to potentially harm yourself with a synthetic product when you could just as easily be using a natural product? Remember: until a new ingredient has been tested, it's impossible to know what type of impact it could have on the body. You don't want to be one of the unfortunate souls decades down the line, suffering from health problems that you could have avoided.
