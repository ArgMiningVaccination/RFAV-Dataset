Menstruating women have likely heard of TSS, but tampon-users aren't the only people who get it; it can also develop after a [nosebleed, infection, or surgery](http://www.thecut.com/2015/06/everything-you-should-know-about-tampons-tss.html). A primer: TSS is caused when the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus multiplies and produces a toxin. People can have staph A on and in their bodies: About [20 percent](http://www.thecut.com/2015/06/everything-you-should-know-about-tampons-tss.html) of people have it on their skin and more have it in their nose; it's not known how many women have it in their vaginal flora. In order to multiply, the bacteria needs a good place to hang out \u2014 like, say, nosebleed packing or a tampon. Some people's immune systems can fight an onslaught of staph, but in others it can lead to a bacterial infection and life-threatening organ failure and [sepsis](http://www.sepsis.org/sepsis_and/toxic_shock/). (Initial [symptoms](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000653.htm) include sudden high fever, rash, muscle aches, diarrhea or vomiting, and confusion.) Researchers from the Medical University of Vienna and an Austrian pharmaceutical company developed the vaccine from a detoxified Staphylococcus toxin; people who receive it develop antibodies to staph. They conducted a Phase I trial with 46 young women and men and determined that it was safe and effective. In the [results](http://thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(16)30115-3/fulltext) published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, they wrote, \"no vaccination-related severe or serious adverse events occurred.\" Vaccines are subject to [three phases of clinical testing](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/test-approve.html) before facing the approval process and though they've already [started Phase II](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160611125403.htm), so we're not exactly close to having a TSS vaccine on the market any time soon. But how many people would benefit from such a shot? The researchers said blood tests can show whether a person is [low in staph antibodies](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/06/160611125403.htm) and risk groups could be vaccinated preventively. The high-absorbency tampons of the 1970s caused a wave of TSS cases, but it's now considered a [rare disease](http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/Safety/AlertsandNotices/PatientAlerts/ucm070003.htm). In the United States, there have been [fewer than 80 TSS cases per year](http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6522md.htm) since 2011, and experts estimate that fewer than [half](http://www.thecut.com/2015/06/everything-you-should-know-about-tampons-tss.html) are linked to tampon use. While it's not common, that doesn't make it any less tragic when young women [land in intensive care](http://www.today.com/health/toxic-shock-syndrome-linked-tampon-use-nearly-kills-michigan-teen-t67941) or [lose a limb](https://www.vice.com/read/meet-the-model-who-lost-her-leg-to-toxic-shock-syndrome-611). Plus, people who've had TSS before are [at risk](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000653.htm) of developing it in the future and are told [not to use tampons](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/toxic-shock-syndrome/basics/prevention/con-20021326). Vaccine or not, women can reduce their risk by using the lowest absorbency tampons possible and changing them [at least every eight hours](http://www.thecut.com/2016/01/womb-detox-pearls-herbal-tampons.html).
