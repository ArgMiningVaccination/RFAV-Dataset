Our research, as well as others', has shown that experimental models of differentiation from pluripotent stem c ells (PSCs), both embryonic (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), recapitulate major steps of the development in embryo. Our long-term aim is to understand how HSA21 affects formation of mesodermal lineages, i.e. mesenchymal, endothelial, card iac, and blood progenitors on molecular and cellular levels and to facilitate the development of new treatments that could prevent or lower the risk of congenital and sporadic cardiovascular and hematopoietic disorders. This project is focused on de fining the earliest phenotypic and molecular signs of abnormal development of mesodermal components in DS. We will e valuate efficiency of mesoderm formation from DS -iPSCs compared to control iPSCs by quantification of mesodermal subsets collected from day 2 to da y 4 of hPSCs differentiation on OP9 that can be assessed by FACS analysis and frequency of MS -CFU and BL -CFU formation. We anticipate that at phenotypic malformations manifested in musculoskeletal , hemato -endothelial, and cardiovascular tissues of DS can be modulated at the mesodermal precursor stage of development. Objective: The goal of this project is to define the earliest phenotypic and molecular signs of abnormal development of mesodermal components in DS. Methods: iPSCs colonies were pla ted on OP9 stromal cells supplemented with differentiation - MEM media, containing 10% FBS, 100 M MTG and 50 g of ascorbic acid. Isolation of APLNR+ precursors (Mesenchymoangioblasts) : Primitive streak/mesendoderm precursors were isolated on day 2 and day 3 of iPSCs/OP9 differentiation by MACS sorting with APLNR -APC -magnetic beads OP9 with anti -mouse CD29 antibodies. Colony -Forming Culture for mesodermal precursors (MS - and BL -CFU): single cell suspension of iPSC -derived cells collected on day 2 and 3 of coculture were placed on a semisolid colony - forming serum 50 g of ascorbic acid and 20ng/ml bFGF. Results and Conclusion: A distinct pattern of differentiation DS, vs. euploid iPSCs can be detected at the earliest step of meso dermal commitment characterized by primitive streak (PS) marker, platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and a novel marker of the PS population apelin receptor (APLNR) or CD140a. DS iPSC has shown three times increase of PDGFR/CD140a cell population compared to euploid iPSC on day 2 and day 3 of differentiation (Fig). Moreover, blast colony forming potential was compromised and show ed three times decrease on day 3 in both mesenchymal and blast col onies growing in semisolid media on day 3. Thus, we defined the earliest phenotypic signs of abnormal development of mesodermal components in DS at Mesenchymoangioblasts stage of mesodermal commitment of hiPSCs. We are going to analyze the cellular subset s derived in this experiment in order to determine molecular changes that are associated with aberrant differentiation of DS -IPSc compared to normal IPSc.

Here, we use a mouse model in which we introduced two \"knock -in\" mutations (T74A and T393A) to disrupt Fbw7 -depen dent regulation of cyclin E, its prototypic substrate, and examine the consequences of cyclin E dysregulation to HSC function. T393A HSCs self -renew normally; however, we identified defects in their multi -lineag e reconstituting capacity. By inducing hematologic stress, we expose an impaired self-renewal phenotype in cyclin E knock -in HSCs, which is associated with defective cell cycle exit and emergence of chromosome instability (CIN). Importantly, p53 deletion i nduces defects in both self -renewal and multi -lineage reconstitution in cyclin E knock -in HSCs with serial transplantation and CIN in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Moreover, CIN is a feature of fatal T -cell malignancies that ultimately d evelop in recipients of cyclin ET74A T393A; p53-null HSCs. findings demonstrate the of Fbw7 -dependent cyclin E control to the hematopoietic system and highlight CIN as a characteristic feature of HSC dysfunction and malignancy indu ced by deregulated cyclin E.

Woodruff Department: Ob/Gyn Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Sciences: Women's Health Research so-youn -kim@northweste phosphoinositide 3 -kinase activation in oocytes promotes survival but not premature loss of primordial follicles Summary: The maturation of the follicle is initiated by the AKT -mediated phosphorylation of FOXO3A in oocytes, which is triggered by an increase in the phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) - trisphosphate (PIP3) level. Oocyte PIP3 levels homolog (PTEN ) and phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI3K) activities. However, the events that tip the balance towards PI3K to initiate the activation of immature follicles are not fully understood. Objective: To study the role of PI3K activity in oocyte development, we generated transgenic mice that express constitutively active PI3K in the primordial oocytes. Sample: We generated transgenic mice that express constitutively active PI3K (PI3KCA*) from the primordial oocytes, using GDF9 -iCre. Cre recombinase driven by GDF9 is supposed to be expressed in oocyte because it had been repor ted GDF9 is oocyte -specific. Methods : We co mpared mouse ovaries in Cre - and Cre+ during developmental stages. We counted the number of follicles and checked the expression level of proteins in PI3K downstream pathway. We further tested in vitro maturatio n in oocytes from Cre - and Cre+ PI3K ovary. Results: The ovaries of Cre+ transgenic mice at neonatal stage had an excess number of primordial follicles showing that the elevation of PIP3 level promotes oocyte survival after follicle formation. Surprisingl y, perinatal activation of PI3K in the oocyte did not initiate the maturation of primordial follicles in neonatal ovaries. The primordial oocyte of Cre+ mice demonstrated a nuclear accumulation of PTEN , indicating the presence of a PTEN -mediated protective mechanism against premature activation. Oocytes within the supernumerary primordial follicles activated without granulosa cell maturation and were cleared from the initial pool, resulting in an identical number of primordial follicles to Cre - mice at pube rty. This observation suggests that an intrinsic mechanism controls size of ovarian reserve. Finally, PI3K activity did not affect normal follicle activation. Thus, antral follicles with meiotically competent oocytes accumulated in Cre+ ovaries. Conclusi ons: Our current study has highlighted the importance of PI3K signaling in follicle survival, and the dominant role of PTEN in the maintenance of female reproductive lifespan.

Green Department: Department of Pathology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Basic Science is a novel interacting protein first expressed as keratinocytes transit out of the basal layer and becomes concentrated in the upper cell layers of the epidermis. Dsg1 is not only required for epidermal integrity, but also coordinates EGFR/MAPK signaling events to promote differentiation , and supports cellular shape changes during strati fication. However , how Dsg1 regulates epidermal morphology is not yet understood. In our study, u sing a modified yeast two -hybrid screen, we identified the dynein light chain, Tctex -1, as a novel binding partner of Dsg1 that interacts with the last 140 ami no acids of the cytoplasmic desmoglein unique region. Tctex -1 was originally characterized as a cargo adaptor for dynein motor transport, but recent data suggest its additional role in coupling microtubule and actin dynamics. Objective: We hypothesized th at Dsg1 -1 interaction between Dsg1 was observed in the apical cell layers of human foreskin using a proximity ligation assay. Supporting our idea, k nockdown of Tctex -1 or Dsg1 led to reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and alterations of cell shape in both submerged and 3 -dimensional organotypic epidermis cultures (rafts). Additionally, silencing Tctex -1 or overexpression of a Dsg1 mutant lacking the domains involved in Tctex -interaction induced defective tissue architecture, including the app earance of basal -like rounded cells in the superficial granular layers of the rafts. Interestingly, knockdown of Tctex -1 did not affect the expression of early differentiation markers, thus raising the possibility that Dsg1 -Tctex -1 binding may govern a dis tinct morphogenesis pathway independent of Dsg1 -mediated differentiation. Conclusions: Our preliminary study suggest s that Dsg1 -Tctex interaction is important for proper tissue 3D architecture .

Surgical intervention is often required to stabilize the spine, and these procedures can have significant morbidity that could be avoided with prevention or containment of the metastases by therapeutics. Although it is highly efficacious to achieve successful fusion, the use of rhBMP -2 in patients with a history of cancer is contraindicated d ue to the controversial question of its safety. Current literature provides no consensus on the clinical effects of BMP on metastasis, especially for lung cancer. Direct intraosseous injection into the vertebral body allows for the opportunity to quantify the effects of a specific bone metastasis without interference from other metastases as are seen in rodent models currently employed. To date, this condition has not been replicated in a pre -clinical animal model, which would greatly aid the study of poten tial intervention. Objective: Due to the prevalence of and mortality associated with lung cancer, the study of its metastatic spread is of utmost importance. Our interest lies in the many patients with spine metastases who could benefit greatly from the u se of rhBMP -2 in surgical management of spine pathology. However, therapeutics that may prevent or contain metastases could also significantly improve patient outcomes. The development of this lung cancer spine metastasis model enables subsequent study to not only provide data supporting or refuting the safety of rhBMP -2 in these patients, but also to quantify the potential for various chemoprotective agents to inhibit the formation of metastatic spine lesions in lung cancer patients. Methods: Sixteen athy mic rats underwent transperitoneal exposure and injection of 50,000 luciferase -labeled A549 cancer cells into the L5 vertebral body. At 4 weeks post implantation, in vivo bioluminescent imaging (BLI), plain anteroposterior radiographs, and microCT imaging were employed to quantitate tumor burden. Histological analysis allowed further characterization of pathologic changes. Results: Two animals died prior to 4 weeks post -implantation. At 4 weeks, BLI showed focal signal in the L5 vertebral body in 13 of 14 remaining animals. Average tumor burden of these rats as determined by BLI flux measurement was 4.65x106 p/s. Radiographs and microCT demonstrated osteolysis in 100% of the 13 animals that showed focal signal on BLI, and degree of osteolysis correlated wit h BLI signal. Histological analysis also demonstrated tumor invasion causing osteolysis in the L5 vertebral body. Conclusions: This is the first report of a successful lung cancer metastasis model to the lumbar spine. The correlation and consistency of BL I, plain radiographs, microCT, and histological analysis supports this model as a reliable method to study behavior of isolated spinal metastases from lung cancer. This model avoids the pitfalls of systemic tumor burden seen in other metastatic models, suc h as unpredictable metastases location, while concurrently providing predictable tumor localization that mimics spinal metastasis in humans. Subsequent studies will exploit this model to determine whether rhBMP -2 promotes or inhibits the growth and develop ment of A549 lung cancer spine lesions. More generally, this model enables the testing of an array of therapeutic agents, as well as possible tumor potentiators, to discern their effects on metastatic lung cancer.

Department of Pathology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL USA Mammalian eryt hropoiesis is a dynamic process in which erythroid progenitors proliferate and differentiate into mature enucleated red blood cells. In the late stage of erythropoiesis , erythroblasts undergo terminal cell -cycle exit, chromatin condensation and extrusion o f the pycnotic nucleus via an asymmetric cell division . Recent genetic and biochemical studies illustrated that various signaling pathways, including histone deacetylations and other chromatin modifications chromatin condensation and enucl eation . However, it is unclear the global dynamic changes of the nucleosome and how different histones are regulated during chromatin condensation. We proposed to directly characterize the expression levels and localization of different histones and their variants during erythropoiesis. We found that histone and its variants are differentially expressed during erythropoieisis , while the mmunofluorescenc e experiment s of these histones together with nuclear lamins revealed a gradually enlarged nuclear opening through which most histones, except histone H2AZ, were released out of the nucleus. This nuclear opening was further confirmed by electron microscopy . The same phenotype was observed in vivo in fresh ly purified late stage erythroblasts and bone marrow. Western blot analysis also demonstrate d histones release , however, many well known nuclear proteins remained in the nucleus in this process . Mechanistic ally, we demonstrated that caspase -3 was required in the regulation of nuclear openings and histone release during erythropoieiss. Inhibition or knockdown of caspase -3 significantly blocked lamin B opening and histone release, which led to inhibition of ch romatin condensation and cell differentiation, and ultimate cell death. To investigate the role of histone release in chromatin condensation, we analyzed the genome - wide nucleosome localization . Using m icrococcal nuclease digestion of chromatin followed b y next generation sequencing (MNase -seq) technique, we determined genome -wide gain of nucleosome occupancy during the early stage of terminal erythropoiesis, which is consistent with the overexpression of histones. In contrast, a global nucleosome depletio n was observed in the late stage of terminal erythropoiesis, which is consistent with the histone release out of the nucleus in this stage. In summary, our study revealed a \"prokaryotic face\" of a eukaryotic cell by showing a novel nuclear opening that is unique to mouse erythroblasts. We also demonstrated that the dynamic changes of various histones, with their selective and gradual release out of the nucleus, is required for chromatin condensation and differentiation during erythropoieisis.

We investigated the synaptic connectivity between CT neurons and pyramidal -tract (PT) and intratelencephalic (IT) projection neurons using an optogenetic -electrophysiological a pproach. We found that within -class (recurrent, CTCT) connectivity was strong, but across -class connectivity was selective: CTIT connectivity was layer -dependent, while ITCT connectivity was present even though relatively weak compared to ITI T connectivity. Moreover, CTPT connectivity was weak and PTCT connectivity was absent . Disynaptic inhibitory inputs mostly paralleled the excitatory connectivity. We also examined thalamocortical (TC) input to these classes of neurons, and found that it selectively target s non-CT neurons. Thus, CT , IT, and PT neurons comprise a projection - and layer -specific connectivity matrix within primary motor cortex. In addition, CT neurons do not receive TC input, suggesting that CT neurons provide feedforward rather than feedback input in corticothalamic interaction in motor cortex. Objective: To determine functional connectivity between CT, PT, and IT neurons in mouse primary motor cortex. Methods: Rabies virus encoding channelrhodopsin -2 (RV -ChR2) was injected into motor thala mus, contralateral striatum, or spinal cord, to label CT, IT, or PT neurons, respectively. Inert fluorescent retrograde tracers were also injected in these locations, allowing whole -cell recordings to be made from identified projection neurons in brain sli ces while photostimulating the ChR2 -expressing population. To assess organization of TC input, we injected adeno - associated virus encoding ChR2 (AAV -ChR2) into the VA/VL complex of the thalamus , and injected retrograde tracers to label projection neurons f or targeted recording. Results: Photostimulation of CT neurons evoked excitatory postsynaptic current s (EPSC) in CT neurons and L6 IT neurons, but not in L5B IT or PT neurons. Stimulation of IT neurons evoked EPSC s in both IT and CT neurons, while stimula tion of PT neurons did not evoke response s in CT neurons. Disynaptic postsynaptic inhibitory current s (IPSC) were also observed in CT neurons when stimulating CT and IT, but not PT neurons. Finally, photostimulation of TC axons evoked relatively large monosynaptic EPSC s on PT and I T neurons compared to CT neurons. Conclusions: These results, combined with previous data, indicate a hierarchical organization with mostly unidirectional connections from IT to both CT and PT neurons, and with minimal cross -talk between the CT and PT subcortical output channels. An implication of this directional and divergent network of projection neurons is that it provides circuit -level substrates for differentially regulating the output of motor cortex activity to thalam us versus other subcortical and subcerebral structures.

Injury timing influences the type of lesion, which structures are damaged, and potential compensatory mechanisms. The current study aimed to quantify differences in the white matter structure of descending motor pathways between pre - and perinatal injuries to determine the extent of damage to the ipsilesional tracts as well as potential changes in the contralesional tracts. Sample: 12 individuals with pediatric hemiplegia resulting from a pre - (n=6) or perinatally (n=6) acquired unilat eral lesion and 10 age -matched control subjects participated. Injury timing was confirmed with medical records. Methods: All participants underwent diffusion tensor imaging with a 3 T scanner with 60 diffusion directions. Probabilistic tractography was co nducted from hand -drawn masks of the cerebral peduncles to the posterior limb of the internal capsule to reconstruct a portion of the corticospinal tracts. The average fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffu sivity (RD), and volume were then calculated. Each metric was compared between the prenatal, perinatal, and control groups using one -way ANOVAs and Fisher's LSD t -tests when appropriate. Results: The integrity of the white matter in the lesioned corticosp inal tract was decreased compared to controls for both prenatal and perinatal injuries with regards to FA (prenatal: p=0.034; perinatal: p=0.001), and additionally in (p<0.001 ) and RD (p<0.001 ). Comparisons between the prenatal and perinatal groups showed greater damage in the perinatal group for both prenatal and perinatal tracts showed decreased integrity differences were found between the prenatal and perinatal groups. Neither prenatal or perinatal injuries demonstrated decreases in tract volume compared to controls, however, perinatal injuries showed significantly greater volume on the nonlesioned side relative to controls (p=0.004). Conclusions: Both prenatal and perinatal unilateral injuries result in decreased white matter integrity on both the lesioned and nonlesioned sides. Perinatal injuries demonstrate both greater damage compared to prenatal injuries, as well as greater compensatory increases in volume on the nonlesioned side. A better understanding of how the pathways a re impacted differently depending on injury timing can help to explain differences in motor deficits and lead to more tailored interventions.

Using a combination of laser photocoagulation of the trabecular meshwork and injection of polystyrene microbeads into the anterior chamber of mouse eyes, we were able to induce significant and sustained IOP elevation for several months. W e then characterized the functional degeneration of the retina and the superior colliculus (SC), where most RGCs project to. Methods: Full-field electro -retinogram (ERG) was used to characterize retinal responses to light stimulation in glaucomatous mice . We also applied focal ERG to examine whether certain areas of the retina are vulnerable to the insult of glaucoma. A 256 -channel multielectrode array (MEA, Multi -channel Systems) was used to examine light response properties of RGCs . We further characteri zed the receptive field (RF) properties of SC neurons by in vivo extracellular single - unit recording. Results: Using full -field ERG, we showed that the dysfunction of the inner retina was first detected at 4 -5 weeks, and then progressed into the outer re tina. Furthermore, with MEA recordings to examine the light response properties of RGCs, we demonstrated that the RGC degeneration was subtype -dependent. The ON and OFF RGCs had smaller receptive fields in glaucomatous eyes compared to age -matched control eyes. In contrast, ON -OFF cells exhibited no significantly changes. In addition, focal ERG showed that different locations of the retina exhibited different susceptibility to the insult of ocular hypertension. We further investigated the functiona l deficit s of SC neurons in glaucomatous mice . At 11 -14 weeks after the induction of ocular hypertension, SC neurons exhibited irregular RF structure with disrupted pattern of ON - OFF subfield overlap. Conclusions: Together, our findings provide the foundation to further characterize the mechanisms underlying the progressive degeneration of the retina and the higher visual centers in glaucoma.

Introduction: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is associated with pronounced fibro - inflammatory stromal reaction that contributes to tumor progression. A critical step in tumor progression is epithelial to mesenchymal transition, which can be regulated by the Snail family of transcription factors. We hav e recently demonstrated that coexpression of Snail (Snai1) and mutant KrasG12D in the pancreas of transgenic mice (Kras+/Snail+) promotes fibrosis (Shields MA et al 2013) . Objective: To understand whether Snail modulates inflammation in the pancreas, we examined the effect of expressing Snail in KrasG12D mice on mast cell infiltration, which has previously been shown to contribute to PDAC progression. Methods: Pancreatic tissue samples from Kras+/Snail+ and control Kras+/Snail - mice were collected at 3 m onths of age for analysis. The sections were stained with CD45 antibody for leukocytes, c hloracetate esterase (CAE) and toluidine blue for mast cells, CD3 antibody for T - cells, FOXP3 antibody for T -regulatory cells, Gr -1 antibody for granulocytes/myeloid d erived suppressor cells, and mouse F4/80 antibody for macrophages. Human PDAC tumors were stained for mast cells using CAE an d tryptase. In addition, RNA isolated from human tumors was analyzed for Snail, tryptase and cytokines by qRT-PCR . The samples from pancreatic tissue of Kras+/Snail+ and Kras+/Snail - mice were analyzed for mRNA by qRT -PCR. Effect of Snail expression in a PDAC cell line on cytokine expression and mast cell migration was also determined. Results: We demonstrate that there are increased numbers of mast cells in the pancreas of Kras+/Snail+ mice compared to Kras+/Snail - mice. We also demonstrate that human PDAC tumors with increased Snail expression are associated with increased mast cell infiltration and that Snail expression in human PD AC tumors positively correlates with expression of stem cell factor (SCF), a cytokine known to regulate mast cell migration. Concomitantly, we demonstrate that SCF levels are increased in the Kras+/Snail+ mice compared to Kras+/Snail - mice. To establish wh ether Snail directly regulates SCF levels, we examined the effect of overexpressing Snail in PDAC cells on SCF levels. We show that Snail increases SCF levels in PDAC cells and that the conditioned media from Snail -expressing PDAC cells increase mast cell migration. Significantly, inhibiting SCF using neutralizing antibody blocks Snail -induced migration of mast cells. Conclusions: These results help to elucidate how the EMT regulator Snail contributes to inflammation associated with PDAC tumors . Presenting Author: Christina R.

P DAC tumors, in particular, demonstrate pronounced collagen -rich stromal reaction. It has been shown that cancer cells can invade in 3D collagen either as single cells or as group of cells with intact cell -cell junctions ('cohort migration') . We have previously shown that the key collagenase membrane type 1 - matrix metalloproteinase (MT1 -MMP; MMP -14) is upregulated in human PDAC tumors and contributes to invasion of PDAC cells in 3D collagen. However, it is not known the extent to which MT1 -MMP regulates cohort invasion of PDAC cells in 3D collagen. Objective: To elucidate the mechanisms regulating cohort invasion of PDAC cells in 3D collagen. Methods: PDAC cells (Panc1 and CD18) with inducible expression of MT1 -MMP were grown in 3D collagen for 3 days. The collagen gels were fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned. The collagenolytic paths generated by invading cells were quantified and relative invasion in 3D collagen was determined. In addition, the ability of MT1 -MMP to modu late cellular con traction in 3D collagen was evaluated. Results: We demonstrate that MT1 -MMP regulates single cell invasion of the more mesenchymal Panc1 cells and cohort invasion of the more epithelial CD18 cells. Treatment with EGF caused 'single -file' polarized cohort invasion of attenuated by ERK1/2 and ROCK1/2 inhibition. Since G protein alpha subunit G 13 can enhance ROCK1/2 signaling, we examined the role of G 13 in cohort migration of MT1 -MMP -expressing CD18 cells.

PDAC tumors also exhibit epigenetic changes that are associated with chemotherapy resistance. Thus , there is increasing interest in developing inhibitors targeting epigenetic chan ges, including targeting BET proteins that bind acetylated histones to regulate gene transcription. BET inhibitors, including JQ1, are effective against both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. We ha ve found that JQ1 is also effective against PDAC cells. Since cancer cells eventually develop resistance to chemotherapy as well as to targeted t herapies, we examined whether it was possible for PDAC cells to develop resistance to JQ1. Method PDAC cell lines CD18 and Panc1 were treated with increasi ng concentration of JQ1. Although we were unable to generate JQ1 resistant Panc1 cells, we successfully generated CD18 cells resistant to JQ1 (CD18 -JQ1R). Additionally , we 5 -fluorouracil (CD18 -CR). CD18 -JQ1R were analyzed for cross -resistance to an unrelated BET inhibitor, iBET. We also compared the morphological changes of CD18 -JQ1R cells to that of parental CD18 (CD18 -P) and CD18 -CR cells. Additionally , we examined the effect of CD18 -JQ1R on JQ1 target genes : c-MYC, FOSL 1 and HMGA2.

Bromodomain (BRD) and extra terminal domain (BET) proteins chromatin 'readers' which bind to acetylated histones and regula te transcription of genes. A number of selective inhibitors of BET proteins (e.g. JQ1 and I -BET151) have been developed that compete with the acetyl - binding pockets of BRD proteins. Previously, we have shown that collagen induces PDAC expression of high mo bility group A2 (HMGA2), an architectural protein that modulates chromatin state and also contributes to chemoresistance . Objective: Examine the efficacy of BET inhibitors Methods: AsPC1 and CD18 cells were grown in 3D collagen and were treated with JQ1 or I-BET151 . Effect on previously described JQ1 -target genes was examined at the protein and mRNA levels. Additionally, the effect on colony s ize in 3D collagen was determined. Results: We show that BET inhibitors decrease growth in three -dimensional collagen of AsPC1, CD18 and Panc1 cells, including PDAC cells that have undergone epithelial -to-mesenchymal transition or have become resistant to chemotherapy. Although BET inhibitors decrease c -MYC only in AsPC1 and CD18 cells, downregulating c -MYC decreases growth of all 3 PDAC cell lines in three -dimensional collagen. FOSL1, which is additionally targeted by BET bromodomain inhibitors in AsPC1, CD18 and Panc1 cells, also regulates growth of all 3 PDAC cell lines in three -dimensional collagen. Significantly, BET inhibitors repress HMGA2 levels in all 3 PDAC cell lines grown in three -dimensional collagen. Importantly, overexpression of HMGA2 mitiga tes the effect of BET bromodomain inhibitors on growth and c -MYC and FOSL1 expression. Conclusions: Overall, these results demonstrate that BET bromodomain inhibitors block growth of PDAC cells in three -dimensional collagen and that BET inhibitors are po tential therapeutic agents for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

The mechanism behind these effects is controversial. 2,3,7,8 -tetrachlorodibenzo -p-dioxin negat ively impacts bone quality and is suggested to affect osteoblast differentiation. We hypothesized that dioxin treatment inhibits spinal fusion in a rat posterolateral arthrodesis model, and the effects are mediated by the aryl -hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). AHR involvement was elucidated in vitro by co -treatment with the receptor blocker, alpha -Naphthoflavone ( ANF). We evaluated parameters important to osteogenesis after vehicle and dioxin treatment of various cells. Methods : Female Long -Evans rats pre -treated with weekly IP injections of dioxin or vehicle control for 6 weeks were anesthetized and posterior lumbar bilateral fusion across the transverse processes of the L4 and L5 vertebrae was performed using 1 g rhBMP -2 on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) . Treatments continued until sacrifice at 4 weeks post -op. Spines were evaluated using radiographs, microCT, and fusion scoring. Fusion scores were determined via manual palpation by 3 blinded observers, whereby 0=no bridging bone; 1=unilateral bridging ; 2=bilateral bridging. An average fusion score of 1.0 was considered fused. Rat bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) were grown under standard or osteogenic (ascorbic acid/ -glycerophosphate/dexamethasone) conditions and co -treated with dioxin and ANF. A wound assay, whereby cells migrated across a scratched monolayer was performed to evaluate the rate of cell migration after treatment with DMSO, dioxin, nicotine, ANF, or dioxin+ANF. The percent wound closure was measured at 0, 8, 15, and 24 hours. An al kaline phosphatase (ALP) assay was performed to quantify the enzyme with cells treated with control, dioxin, ANF, and dioxin + ANF. Results: Radiographs showed decreased bridging bone formation in dioxin -treated rats. Fusion scores in dioxin -treated rats were significantly lower than controls (1.73 vs 0.71; p<0.001, Figure 1A). Fusion rates (100% vs 50%; p<0.01; Figure 1B). MicroCT quantification and 3 -D reconstruction showed no change in fusion mass between groups (Figure 1C). Dioxin inhibited cell migration in vitro ; nicotine did not show the same effect. Dioxin was shown to decrease the amount of active ALP when compared to control, ANF, or ANF+dioxin. The effects of ANF rescued the inhibitory eff ect of dioxin in rodent BMSCs. Conclusion : Dioxin significantly lowered fusion rates in a rat arthrodesis model. Our in vitro studies suggest that dioxin inhibits pre -osteoblast cell migration through activation of the AHR, as the AHR antagonist, ANF, re scued the effect of dioxin in those studies. Dioxin was shown to have an inhibitory effect on the activity of membrane -bound ALP activity, indicating dioxin effects cell recruitment as well as cell activity in the inhibition of bone healing. Although smoki ng causes complications in bone healing, the mechanisms remain elusive. Our study suggests that dioxin -like compounds may be responsible for these inhibitory effects, and that agents which block the AHR may have therapeutic potential in the smoking popula tion.

Summary: Heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI) is a significant cause of morbidity/mortality. During MI, cardiomyocyte (CM) death triggers recruitment of phagocytic monocyte cells that clear dead (necrotic) and dying (apoptotic) myocardial tissue. Prompt phagocytic clearance of dying cells (efferocytosis) triggers homeostatic tissue remodeling via inducing anti- inflammatory and pro-reparative signaling within the phagocyte, while inefficient clearance leads to delay of both inflammation resolution and tissue repair after MI. We found that CMs were resistant to efferocytosis compared to other cells that turnover in the myocardium. However, the mechanism of the defective CM clearance, including molecular factors that drive interactions between CMs and phagocytes and their physiological significance remain elusive. CD47 is a marker of cell viability and communicates \"don't-eat-me\" signals to SIRP on phagocytes. Though CD47 is usually downregulated on dying T-cells, neutrophils, and erythrocytes to facilitate their clearance, prolonged existence of CD47 on tumor cells can help tumor escape phagocytic clearance. Interestingly, we found CD47 was increased in apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Blockade of elevated CD47 on tumor cell surface facilitated tumor clearance by phagocytes, however, little is known about the role of CD47 in CM clearance after MI and its role in inflammation resolution. We hypothesized that elevated CD47 on apoptotic CMs suppresses efficient efferocytosis by macrophages and in turn, delays myocardial inflammation resolution and accelerates progression to post MI heart failure. Objective: To test the physiologic role of CD47 during post MI inflammation resolution and tissue repair, and the mechanism of CD47 regulation in dying CMs. Methods: For in vitro studies, to determine if there is a prolonged existence of CD47 on CMs in hypoxic heart, we isolated primary adult mouse ventricular cardiomyocytes (CMs) and induced apoptosis via hypoxia to mimic the hypoxic milieu in infarcted heart. We compared the surface protein level of CD47 on dying CMs to viable CMs. The kinetics of CD47 expression in other cells that turn over in the heart was also determined to test if CD47 has unique expression profile on CMs. Next, to test the hypothesis that surface CD47 inhibits CM efferocytosis by macrophages, we compared efferocytosis efficiency of CMs treated with CD47 blocking antibody or isotype IgG. Furthermore, in order to determine if CD47 blockade post MI enhances inflammation resolution and cardiac repair, we induced MI in our mice model and administrated CD47 blocking mAb or isotype IgG into the of the our mice model. In vivo efferocytosis efficiency, inflammatory cytokine profile, post I/R infarct size, and cardiac function were measured in both experimental and control mice to test the physiology relevance of CD47 blockade. Results: CD47 was upregulated on ischemia/reperfusion injured CMs. Blocking surface CD47 on dying CMs enhanced CM engulfment both in vitro and in vivo. Injection of CD47 blocking antibody into the infarcted myocardium post I/R infarct size, inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and preserved cardiac ejection fraction and diastolic/systolic cardiac function after myocardial infarction. Conclusions: This study identified CD47 as a don't-eat-me signal expressed on cardiomyocytes that inhibits effective clearance of dying CMs in the infarcted heart post MI. CD47 blockade during post-ischemic reperfusion enhances efferocytosis of injured CMs and enhances inflammation resolution and cardiac repair. Our findings shed light on developing complementary therapies to prevent post MI heart failure. Presenting Author: Adam E. Jakus Position : Graduate Research Fellow Principal Investigator: Ramille N.

Commonly used dental and orthopedic bio materials . such as sintered and granular hydroxyapatite (HA) ceramics, although bioactive, are costly to manu facture , brittle, and have undesirable handling characteristics . Recent efforts have focused on creating composite structures from polymer and HA using 3D -printing (3DP) . Until now, these constructs have had less than ideal mechanical characteristics, bioa ctivity, or both . 3DP not only permits the rapid fabrication of complex, custom structures ; we show that a new room -temperature, 3DP technique can be used to quickly fabricate hyperelastic bone (HB) constructs defined by 90 wt.% HA content with hyperelast ic and highly osteogenic properties , making HB an ideal material for dental and orthopedic applications. Objective : To illustrate through substantial mechanical, physical, in vitro , and in vivo characterization and experimentation that room -temperature 3D P HB is an exceptionally promising dental and orthopedic biomaterial. Methods: HB 3D -printable, liquid inks were synthesized via suspension, dissolution, and agitation of 90 wt.% HA and 10 wt.% elastomer in a solvent mixture. The inks were then 3D- printed into scaffold constructs using a 3D -Bioplotte r\u00ae. Microstructures of 3DP constructs were characterized using, micro tomography (\u00b5CT) scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and optical profilometry; the mechanical properties via cyclic and dynamic mech anical testing ; and physical properties via contact angle and liquid absorbance tests . In vitro experiments utilizing bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) seeded onto HB scaffolds (100k/scaffold) were performed up to 28 days in non -osteogenic culture conditions. DNA, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteogenic gene were quantitatively determined using Picogreen\u00ae fluorescence, QuantiBlu\u00ae , and quantitative real time - PCR), respectively. Additional viability and cell morphology observations were obtained using confocal microscopy followed by high -resolution SEM observations, including site -specific electron -dispersive x -ray spectroscopy (EDS) of mineral formations. In vivo biocompatibility studies were perform ed using subcutaneous implant s in female BALB/c mice using 3DP HB and hot-melt 3D P 50:50 weight HA and elastomer scaffolds as a control. Scaffolds were explanted after 7 and 35 days and analyzed using traditional histological techniques as well as electron - histology (E -Histo), a new technique developed by the author. Results: The resulting 3DP HB scaffolds , hyperelastic, which permi ts them to be compressed, at least 55%, and recover to their original size an d shape . This is due to the unique m aterial mic rostructure , which has similarities to natural bone with respect to porosity, roughness, and hydrophilicity . In vitro evaluations reveal that HB not only supports cell viability and proliferation, but also promotes osteogen ic activity, differentiation, as well as extra cellular matrix and de novo mineral synthesis and deposition. In vivo biocompatibility tests indicate that HB does not elicit an immune response or fibrous encapsulation. In fact, HB scaffolds are heavily inte grated and vascularized by day 35. This is in -melt 3DP 50:50 HA-polymer scaffolds. Conclusions: 3DP HB is a remarkable new composite comprised entirely of FDA approved materials. Its remarkable hyperelastic properties, enabled through the 3DP process, and in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, combined with its eas e of synthesis and ability to quickly 3D -print into custom, ready to use constructs make HB an incredibly promising new dental and orthopedic biomaterial.

However, targeting of adenovirus to human glioblastom a remains a challenge due to the low expression level of CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor), the known adenovirus receptor, in glioma cells. To improve the targeting efficiency of Ad5 to glioblastoma, transductional retargeting strategies, includ ing genetic capsid modification and adaptor -based strategy, have been used. The latter involves the use of a molecular bridge to retarget the Ad from its native primary receptor to a different cell surface receptor. Aptamers are single -stranded oligonucleo tides that bind at high affinity to a target molecule, and are good candidates for targeted cancer therapy. In this study, to construct an aptamer -modified Ad5, we first genetically modified the hypervariable of Ad hexon would be metabolically biotinylated during virus production in HEK293 cells. Then the biotin labeled aptamer was attached to the modified Ad through avidin -biotin binding. The aptamers used in this study include AS1411 and GBI -10. The former is a DNA aptamer that targets nucleolin, a nuclear matrix protein found on the surface of cancer cells. The latter is a DNA aptamer that can recognize the extracellular matrix protein tenascin -C on the surface of human glioblastoma cells. To exami ne if aptamer -modification of the hexon protein the U251 cells were transduced aptamer -modified Ads. Our results show that the transduction efficiency of AS1411 - or GBI -10-modif ied Ad in U251 cells is approximately 4.1 -fold or 5.2 -fold higher than that of the control vectors. The data indicate that aptamer modified adenovirus would be a useful tool for glioblastoma gene and viral therapy.

Green, PhD Department: Pathology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Sciences: Basic Science Research (DP) is an of desmosomes, intercellular junctions that confer mechanical integri ty to tissues including the s kin and heart . DP mutations are a common cause arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC) , a disease characterized by fibro -fatty replacement of cardiac tissue producing potentially lethal arrhythmias. AC frequently involves misregulation of the gap junction compo nent connexin 43 (Cx43), which is vital for electrical communication between cells. However, the mechanisms by which DP mutations disrupt gap junction assembly and/or function are unknown. Objective: To elucidate mechanisms by which DP regulates gap junc tion assembly and/or function, and to determine how disease mutations in DP interfere with these pathways. Sample: Gap junctions were studied using immortalized and primary cardiac (neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes, NRVCMs) and epithelial (nor mal human epidermal kerationcytes, NHEKs) cell cultures. Organotypic raft cultures were grown to study the regulation of gap junctions in a model of stratified epithelia. Methods: A yeast -two-hybrid screen was conducted to elucidate novel binding partne rs of the DP N -terminus, which contains a hotspot for AC mutations with high pathogenicity. Interactions between DP and EB1, a novel binding partner identified in this screen, were further studied in epithelial cell cultures through use of co -immunoprecipi These studies also involved use of microinjections to assess the coupling of gap junction -permeant dye between neig hboring cells. Results: Our studies identified EB1 (end -binding 1) as a novel binding partner of the DP N - terminus. EB1 is a microtubule (MT) plus -end binding protein that promotes MT-based trafficking of Cx43 to cell borders. Thus, we hypothesized that DP promotes gap junction assembly through EB1 , and that DP mutations contribute to AC development through misregulation of E B1-dependent Cx43 localization . We show that DP -EB1 interactions enable DP to regulate the spatial organization of EB1 and its ass ociated MT plus -ends at regions of cell-cell contact, thereby identifying DP as a novel component of cortical MT capture machinery. Upon expression of select disease mutations targeting the DP hotspot for pathogenic mutations, DP-EB1 interactions are impai red and DP loses its ability to protect MT plus -ends against depolymerization. Using both epithelial and cardiac cell cultures, we further demonstrate that mutations interfering with DP -EB1 interactions produce a statistically significant reduction in Cx43 membrane localization and impair electrical coupling as assessed by dye transfer assays. Conclusions: This work identifies a novel function for DP in binding EB1 to regulate capture and stabilization of MT plus-ends, and elucidates a mechanism by which DP mutations contribute to the development of cardiac and cutaneous diseases. EB1-dependent Cx43 localization should be considered as a mechanistic endpoint used to determine the potential pathogenicities of AC mutations.

We investigated the role of MIOX in perturbation of mitochondrial quality control machinery including mitochondrial dynamics and selecti ve autophagy (mitophagy) under high glucose (HG) ambience both in vitro and in vivo. Results: In HK-2/LLC -PK1 cells with HG treatment stably transfected with MIOX , upregulation of MIOX was accompanied with fragmentation and depolari zation, inhibit ed autophagy and mitophagy, and altered expressions of mitochondrial dynamic and mitophagic proteins. As a result, dysfunctional mitochondria without autophagic removal generate excessive ROS and initiate apoptotic pathway, as indicated by i ncreased MitoSox intensity, Bax cytochrome or an inhibitor of MIOX could partially reverse these perturbations. The mechanism by which MIOX disrupt mitochondrial integrity may be via its modulati on on ROS production and Pink1 - dependent Mfn2 -Parkin interaction. In proximal , an increased MIOX expression and mitochondrial fragmentation but defective autophagy was observed. Dietary supplementation of D -glucarate to diabetic mice decreased MIOX expression , which also attenuated tubular damage and improved renal functions . Importantly, the tubular cells with drug treatment showed partial attenuation of mitochondrial fragmentation and restoration of autophagy /mitophagy , together with decreased oxidative stress and apoptosis. Conclusion: These results suggest a novel mechanism link ing MIOX to mitochondrial dysfunctions during tubular injury in the pathogenesis of DKD, and D -glucar ate may be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of this disease .

Objective : Autophagy, the process by which cytoplasmic materials are degraded, is essential for cell survival, particularly stem cells, which requir e active elimination of unnecessary proteins and organelles that accumulate during their quiescence. We have identified a novel limbal epithelial -preferred microRNA family miRs -103/107. human limbal epithelial keratinocytes (HLEKs) results in a dramatic increase in large hollow vacuoles, suggesting that miRs -103/107 may play a role in regulating autophagy in HLEKs. Methods : We used antagomirs targeting either miR -103, -107(antagos -103/107) or miR -124(Ir - antago; which is not d etectable in keratinocytes).To visualize and characterize the vacuoles, we conducted a combined approach in which contrast light, immunofluorescence, and transmission electron microscopies were used. To determine the origin of the hollow vacuoles, pharmaco logical inhibition of different stages of autophagy was performed. Bioinformatic analysis was combined with luciferase assays and biochemistry to identify the direct targets related to the end stage of autophagy. Results : Following treatment with antagos -103/107, numerous vacuoles devoid of organellar material were noted in HLEKs. Lysosomes were frequently noted in close apposition to autophagasomes. In contrast, control (antago -124) HLEKs had few, if any hollow vacuoles, but did contain numerous lysosomes, lipid droplets and autophagasomes as evidenced by double membranes. Interestingly, the hollow vacuoles induced by antagos -103/107 can be rescued by pharmacologically inhibiting the initiation of autophagy, suggesting the autophagic origin of these vacuole s. Furthermore, blocking of autophagosomal -lysosomal fusion prevented the vacuole formation in the antagos -103/107 -treated HLEKs, indicating that vacuoles were induced by antagos -103/107 after the autophagolysosome formation. To assess whether the lysosomes were functional, co -localization of Lamp1 (a lysosomal marker) and LysoTracker (an indicator of acidification) were observed in the control and antagos -103/107 -treated HLEKs, indicative that lysosomal pH was not significantly altered. Therefore, the accumulation of the vacuoles by antagos -103/107 is due to the failure of the end -stage autophagolysosome clearance. Bioinformatic analysis showed that presenillin -1 and chloride channel 3 and 5 (CLC - 3-5) were predicted targets of miRs -103/107 and shown to be related to orderly clearance of autophagic vacuoles. Luciferase reporter assays and biochemistry confirmed that -1 was the direct target of miRs -103/107. Conclusion : Here we show a limbal preferred microRNA family miR -103/107 is a nove l regulator of autophagy, suggesting an important role of these microRNAs in maintenance of cellular homeostasis in stem cells. Presenting Author: Suzanne M Schauwecker Position : MD-PhD Student Principal Investigator: Charles V Clevenger, MD, PhD Department: Pathology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Sciences: Basic Science , Women's Health Research Email: The polypeptide hormone prolactin (PRL) is essential for normal breast tissue growth and m aturation; however, PRL also contributes to breast cancer development. PRL binds to and activates the transmembrane PRL receptor (PRLr). The PRLr signals from the cell surface to the nucleus both by activating canonical signals, such as the Jak2/Stat5 pathway, and by directly translocating to the n ucleus. We have previously shown that nuclear PRLr binds to the chromatin -modifying protein high-mobility group N2 (HMGN2). The CISH transcription, but the mechanism by which HMGN2 does so is unknown. One potential mechanism previously identified is that HMGN2 binds to nucleosomes and induces chromatin decompaction by competition with chromatin -compacting proteins. Given this, we hypothesized that HMGN2 causes chromatin decompaction at promoters of PRL - responsive genes, allowing the transcriptional machinery to access the promoter DNA and initiate transcription. Objective: The objective of this study is to determine how PRLr -mediated recruitment of HMGN2 stimulates the transcription of PRL -responsive genes. Methods: These studies were carried out in T47D human breast cancer cells, stably expressing either short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting HMGN2 or a nonspecific control shRNA. Following ser um starvation, the cells were treated with human recombinant prolactin . The CISH promoter was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) factors regulating H1. Results: Prior to PRL stimulati on, the CISH promoter was found to exhibit low histone H3 density only near the binding site of the necessary transcription factor Stat5a. Following PRL stimulation, a decrease in H3 density across the CISH promoter was observed. PRL stimulation also resul ted in the loss of H1 at the CISH promoter. Following HMGN2 knockdown, the loss of H1 was attenuated. Therefore, HMGN2 may compete with H1 for binding to the CISH promoter. Consistent with transcriptional activation, PRL stimulation also resulted in increa sed RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) bound at the CISH promoter; knockdown of HMGN2 resulted in less bound Pol II. Conclusions: These data suggest that HMGN2 facilitates PRL -induced transcription by competing with H1 for binding to the promoter DNA, thus prom oting chromatin decompaction to allow the transcriptional machinery to better access the promoter DNA.

Hormones produced by the ovary are important for reproduction, and maintain women's overall health by protecting against brain, cardiovascular, and bone dis eases. The field of oncofertility has sought to provide options for preserving and restoring fertility in patients at risk for iatrogenic ovarian failure, including freezing eggs and ovarian tissue for later use. Autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovaria n cortical tissue has resulted in 17 reported live births, with short -term restoration of endocrine function, but also carries the risk of reintroducing cancer cells. After IRB approved consent, our lab obtained 20% of patient tissue for research, while 80 % of the tissue was cryopreserved for patient use. Ovarian cortical tissues from 4 participants with acute lymphoblastic leukemia were selected for this study. These tissues stained positive for SALL4, confirming that they contained metastatic cancer cells within their ovaries and making them ineligible for current transplant techniques. We are investigating materials that will support long - term growth of ovarian cells, to reduce the risk of transferring diseased cells through ovarian tissue transplantation . We developed a technique by which all cells can be removed from ovary tissue pieces, leaving a decellularized scaffold of extracellular matrix on which patient ovarian cells can be seeded for transplantation. Because human ovarian tissue is rare, we used bovine ovaries as a proxy to develop the decellularization/recellularization procedures. We discovered, through high resolution scanning electron microscopy , that the cortex is comprised of tightly organized collagen fibers, while the medulla contains add itional flexible components such as elastin and fibronectin . Primary mouse granulosa and theca cells seeded onto the bovine medulla scaffold responded to FSH in vitro by producing estradiol. We tested the ability of seeded bovine ovarian scaffolds to funct ion in vivo and produce hormones, by grafting these composites under the renal capsule of ovariectomized pre -pubertal mice. Mice with grafts produced estradiol at levels equivalent to controls. Additionally, small follicles that were seeded onto the grafts grew to become large antral follicles. These data support further development of an artificial organ to provide an environment that sustains quiescent and growing ovarian follicles, restores endocrine function, and reduces the risk of re -introducing cance r cells to young women who survived treatment and wish endocrine or fertility restoration.

Recently, a genome -wide association study, with subsequent independent replication, has shown that mutations in alpha - T-catenin correlate with both the incidence and severity of toluene diisocyanate (TDI) induced asthma, the most common identified cause of occupational asthma. How alpha -T-catenin, a protein primarily found in heart and a component of cadherin -based intercellular junctions, contributes to the pathogenesis of TDI -asthma is unknown. The g oals of this project are to identify t he primar y alpha -T-catenin -expressing lung cell type and determine how it affects the severity of TDI-induced asthma in a murine model. METHODS: Alph a-T-catenin knockout (KO) mice , C57BL/6, were obtained from Dr. Frans Van Roy. Mouse lungs were processed for immun ofluorescence (IF) staining using PFA fixation/paraffin -embedding procedures. Pulmonary vein muscle wall thickness was quantified by dividing the area bounded by the muscle wall by the lumen area from tissue section images. RNA isolated from mouse lung a nd heart tissue was analyzed by qRT -PCR using the SYBR Green system. The TDI -asthma model was performed with mice at least 6 weeks old, with sensitization by intranasal injection of 3% TDI in 1:4 ethyl oil days challenge by ultraso nic nebulization of 1% TDI on days 9 -11. On day 12, a irway hyperresponsivity was assessed by whole -body plethysmography with increasing doses of nebulized methacholine , qRT -PCR analysis of mice demonstrates that alpha -T- catenin mRNA is present in lung at a level that is about 20 times less abundant than heart, indicating its presence in a rare cell type. Alpha -T-catenin was not detected in vascular smoot h muscle, airway smooth muscle , or airway epithelium by western blot or IF analysis. However, alpha-T-catenin was clearly present in cardiomyocytes surrounding pulmonary veins (PV). Alpha -T-catenin co -localized with beta -catenin, plakophillin -2, and conne xin-43 at cell junctions in the WT pu lmonary vein, similar to heart. These PV muscle cells were alpha -smooth muscle actin negative with desmin -positive striations, identifying them as bona fide cardiomyocytes. Alpha -T-catenin KO PVs show an increase in siz e of the cardiomyocyte sheath, an effect that is proportionally similar to the established increase in heart size observed in alpha -T-catenin KO mice. When exposed to the TDI-asthma model described above , the alpha -T-catenin KO mice developed an increased airway hyperresponsivity , with greater reactivity to lower concentrations of methacholine challenges when compared to wild -type littermate controls using enhanced pause measurements via plethysmography . Additionally, there was no statistically significant difference in airway inflammation as examined by BAL. CONCLUSIONS: We have detect ed alpha -T-catenin in the cardiomyocyte sheath of PVs, and its loss is associated with an enlargement of this muscle layer. We also found that alpha -T- catenin KO mice dev elop a more severe asthma phenotype when exposed to TDI, but the mechanism by which alpha -T-catenin loss alters lung function is not known. Since we detected no difference in airway inflammation, alpha -T-catenin loss may induce vascular dysfunction to contribu te to the pathogenesis of TDI-asthma. This has the potential to be become a paradigm - shift away from the airway -centric research surrounding occupational asthma. The mechanism of alpha -T-catenin's contribution will be determined by testing changes to cardi ac junctions, cardiac proliferative signaling , and airway edema future experiments. Presenting Bita F.

Our lab has recently discovered a membrane compartment in endothelial cells (EC) that regulates TEM: The lateral border recycling compartment (LBRC). The LBRC contains a subset of membrane proteins, such as PECAM, CD99, and JAM-A, which are required for TEM. During TEM, membrane from the LBRC is directed to the region of the EC where the leukocyte is transmigrating. This \"targeted recycling\" (TR) facilitates TEM by delivering LBRC membrane surface area and signaling molecules to surround the migrating leukocyte. Inhibiting targeted recycling of the LBRC blocks leukocyte TEM. Targeted recycling of the LBRC requires functional microtubules and kinesin motors. Microinjection of EC with an antibody against the conserved motor domain of kinesin inhibited TR and TEM to a similar magnitude as blocking PECAM or depolymerizing microtubules. We sought to identify the specific kinesin(s) that mediate targeted recycling. Objective: This project will elucidate the role of kinesin in the regulation of TEM of leukocytes, which is critical for the process of inflammation, and it will identify novel potential targets for anti-inflammatory therapy. Sample: We use monocytes and neutrophils, isolated from the blood of healthy human subjects, for our TR and TEM assays in addition to primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are harvested and plated on fibronectin/collagen coated dishes. Methods: We knock down kinesin-1 in HUVEC using shRNA and perform the standard TEM and TR assays previously developed in the lab to determine whether this kinesin regulates TEM and TR. To validate our knockdown data, microinject a monoclonal antibody against kinesin- 1 and perform the same assays to see whether TR is blocked. Results: Preliminary experiments suggested kinesin-1 as a likely candidate. Microinjection of HUVEC with a kinesin-1 monoclonal antibody blocked TEM and TR. Knocking down kinesin-1 in HUVEC decreased targeted recycling of LBRC and leukocyte TEM in preliminary experiments. Conclusions: The findings thus far demonstrate that kinesin-1 is a major molecular motor necessary for LBRC transport along microtubules during TR.

Objective: CD95 has been established as a tumor suppressor for almost 20 years. However, recently it has become clear that CD95 and its ligand, CD95L, have multiple nonapoptotic activities. Our laboratory reported that solid cancers are depe ndent on CD95 for their growth. We sought to test whether CD95 is critical for tumor survival. Methods: We analyzed data on 12 genome -wide arrayed shRNA lethality screen s performed with 12 di fferent cancer cell lines . In order to study the nature of the c ell death observed upon knockdown of CD95 or CD95L, we generated a Tet -inducible vector (pTIP), which was used in combination with broad range of biochemical, cell biological and molecular biology techniques including a small molecule screen and a genome w ide shR NA screen combined with deep sequencing and two mouse tumor models invol ving tissue lethality screens we identified CD95L as one of 651 essential survival genes. We demonstrat ed for the first time that all cancer cells require the expression of CD95 and CD95L for their survival. When either CD95 or CD95L was removed from cancer cells, using either siRNAs or inducible shRNAs, they die through form of cell death that was independ ent of caspase -8, RIPK1, MLKL, and p53, inhibited by Bcl -xL expres sion, and preferentially affected cancer cells. In a mouse model of low -grade serous ovarian cancer, knockout of CD95 caused necrosis in cancerous ovaries. Tumor cells growing out of these mice retained one or two intact CD95 alleles and expressed CD95 protein. Similarly, in a chemically induced mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma, all tumors that formed in mice, with a liver specific knockout of CD95, expressed CD95, suggesting t hat cancer cannot form in the absence of CD95. Death induced by CD95R/L elimination (DICE) is characterized by an increase in cell size and production of mitochondrial ROS, which is followed by DNA damage. It resembles a necrotic form of mitotic catastroph e. No single drug was found to completely block this form of cell death, and it could also not be blocked by the knockdown of a single gene (1). Conclusions: Our data suggests that DICE represents multiple death pathways, which indicates that cancer cells may not be able to acquire resistance to DICE by mutations of single genes. This makes DICE an attractive new way to kill cancer cells.

Objective : CD95 (APO -1/Fas) is a death receptor used by immune cells to kill cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. In additio n to its well -described function as a death receptor, CD95 i s emerging as a tumor promoter that enhances growth, motility, and invasion of cancer cells. In the context of stem cells (SC) , evidence for a pro -survival function of CD95 signaling came from the analysis of neuronal SC, where the stimulation of CD95 signaling increased SC survival while deletion of CD95 resulted in reduced neurogenesis. Moreover, CD95 engagement was reported to accelerate normal liver regeneratio n following partial hepatectomy. CD95 was identified as a marker for human embryonic SCs in a SAGE profiling analysis together with established SC markers such as LIN28, OCT4, NANOG , and SOX2 . We have recently shown that t he elimination of CD95 or its ligand, CD95L, from cancer cells resul ts in death induced by CD95R/L elimination ( DICE ), a type of cell death that resembles a necrotic form of mitotic catastrophe , suggesting that CD95 protects cancer cells from cell death (Hadji et al. Cell Reports, in press) , but its pathophysiological role is not yet clearly understood . We aimed at testing whether DICE differentially affect s cancer cells depending on their differentiation status and stemness . Methods: The p resence of cancer SCs (CSCs) was monitored by W estern blot or by flow cytometry using CSC -related surface markers ( such as CD24 and CD44 for breast and ALDH1 for ovarian and colorectal cancer), tumor -sphere formation under low-adherence conditions , and by using a novel fluorescent plasmid -based report er system that measure s the activity of CSCs - associated mi croRNA s (miRNAs) in living cells. CD95 was stimulated by agonistic antibody anti-APO -1, by shRNAs miRNA sensor system was generated using a 3'UTR fragment of the miR-200 target ZEB2 (previously linked to CSCs) , fused to a green or red fluoro -chrome, using either a wild-type or mutated seed sequence , as a control . Results: Here we report 1) that stimulation of cancer cells through CD95 increases their CSC content and results in a gradual loss of cells sensi tive to CD95 -mediated apoptosis, 2) that this effect is achieved independently of apoptosis induction, as it is not blocke d by the pan -caspase inhibitor z VAD-fmk, and rather represents a mechanism of retro -differentiation. Moreover, 3) CSCs are more susceptible to DICE whereas non-cancer stem cells (non-CSCs ) are mor e For example, CSCs HeyA8 cells enriched in tumor -sphere s are almo st completely resistant to CD95 - mediated apoptosis but highly sensitive to DICE. 4) CD95/CD95L regulation of breast CSCs plasticity involves the activity of miR -200, as monitored by the novel miRNA sen sor system and overexpression of miR -200c in MDA -MB-231 cells could prevent DICE. Finally, 5) the simultaneous induction of D ICE and CD95 -mediated apoptosis could kill cancer cells very efficiently . Conclusions : Stimulation of CD95 on can cer cells or reducing miR -200c levels increases the number of CSCs, which are more sensitive to induction of DICE than non-CSCs , while becoming less sensitive to CD95 mediated apoptosis. In contrast , induction of DICE or overexpression of miR -200c reduces the number or the functionality of CSCs . As a possible therapeutic approach, w e demonstrate that killing of cancer cells can be maximized by a concomitant induction of DICE and CD95 -mediated apoptosis, eliminating both cancer stem cells and non -cancer stem cells.

Currently, the only effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced PCa is androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Initially successful in attenuating disease progression, ADT fails after approximately two years. At this point, PCa is defined as castrate resistant (CR). The high mortality rate of CRPCa and significant impact on patient quality of life requires the development of novel, potent treatments. The failure of castration and other anti-androgen therapies is due, at least in part, to autonomous local testosterone production by PCa tumor cells which drives androgen receptor (AR) signaling and disease progression. In the setting of ADT, two distinct cellular mechanisms support local androgen synthesis: (1) de novo conversion of acetyl coenzyme-A to androgens, and (2) the uptake of cholesterol through scavenger receptor type B-1 (SR-B1) delivered by cholesterol-rich high density lipoproteins (HDLs). Because advanced PCa develops a unique requirement for cholesterol, which is a substrate for androgen biosynthesis, SR-B1 and the enzymes necessary for the biomolecular conversion of cholesterol to androgens are up-regulated in PCa cells. Clearly, cholesterol metabolism, SR-B1, and AR are provocative targets for PCa therapy. My research is focused on nanotechnology developed by our group that offers the ability to exploit SR-B1 for siRNA delivery to knockdown AR expression. With an emphasis on biomimicry, our group has utilized a gold nanoparticle (NP) to formulate synthetic HDL nanostructures (HDL NPs) that recapitulate the size, shape, surface chemistry, and cholesterol binding properties of natural HDLs. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that HDL NPs effectively stabilize modified nucleic acids (NAs) from nuclease degradation and deliver NAs (e.g. siRNA) to PCa cells expressing SR-B1 in vitro and in vivo to knockdown AR gene expression. Furthermore, we are exploring the dynamic interaction between siRNA-HDL NPs and the biological blood components they encounter. Ultimately, we are exploring whether or not HDL NPs inherently target and deliver siRNA to PCa cells, and if they productively transfer therapeutic RNAs to natural lipoproteins and target cells through the same receptor, SR-B1. As such, HDL NPs may enable effective and targeted therapeutic siRNA delivery by direct and indirect mechanisms for advanced PCa therapy.

We hypothesize that progesterone (P4) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) will accelerate mammary carcino genesis induced by MNU, however CDB4124 will efficiently suppress tumor formation stimulated by progesterone. Methods: ovary intact female Sprague Dawley rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of 50mg/kg MNU at 4 -5 weeks of age. 30mg of CDB4124 and 25mg of P4 or MPA (90 release pellets, Innovative research of America, Inc) were implanted in dorsal area at 3 weeks and 4 weeks after MNU injection, respectively. 10 -11 rats were used for each treatment group. Tumor incidence, latency, multiplicity, a nd burden were recorded weekly. 9 weeks after MNU injection all the mice were euthanized and mammary tumors and glands were fixed in 10% (v/v) neutral buffered formalin. Plasma concentrations of CDB4453 were determined by LC -MS/MS. Results: The first tumor appeared in the control group at 5 weeks, and in the P4 and MPA treated groups at 6 weeks after MNU injection. 7 weeks after MNU injection, mammary tumor incidence of MPA and P4 treated groups were 80 % and 50 %, respectively compared to 30% in the control group. 9 weeks after MNU injection all MPA treated mice, 80% of P4 treated mice, and 60% of control mice developed tumors. Tumor incidence, latency, multiplicity, and tumor weight were summarized as mean \u00b1 SD in Table1. Tumo r latency of CDB4124 treated groups was increased; tumor incidence and burden (g) of CDB4124 treated groups were decreased compared to P4 and MPA treated groups. In particular, tumor incidence and burden of CDB4124 + P4 treated group were significantly low er than those of the control group. Plasma CDB4124 and CDB4453 were 11.6 \u00b15.88 ng/mL and 3.4\u00b11.68 ng/mL, respectively. Conclusions: Our results indicated that natural progesterone promotes MNU - induced mammary tumor formation similar to synthetic prog esterone, MPA in rats. Under this tumor permissive environment, CDB4124 provided excellent prevention efficacy, suggesting good potential as breast cancer prevention agent.

The underly ing pathogenesis of UC is poorly understood but genome -wide association studies (GWAS ) and animal studies have indicated that abnormal responses in both the innate and adaptive immune system contribute to disease pathogenesis. IBD patients have increased secretion of mucosal histamine, a bioactive amine best associated with allergic reactions, as well as excretion of a urinary metabolite, n -methylhistamine, both of which correlate with disease severity. Furthermore, animal studies utilizing experimental col itis models have suggested roles for histamine and its receptors (H1R -H4R) in promoting UC -like inflammation. Despite this, the mechanism remains unclear. Initially, we examined the expression pattern of the histamine receptors in newly diagnosed UC patien ts and compared this to healthy controls. We found increased expression of H4R, but not H1R or H2R in biopsies from UC patients, thereby suggesting a potential role in pathogenesis. Objective: To explore the requirement and role of H4R in both innate and a daptive immune responses in ulcerative colitis . Methods: We utilized two experimental models of colitis; oxazolone colitis, a delayed -type hypersensitivity response , which has a prominent Th2 -associated adaptive response, and DSS colitis, which is driven p rimarily by innate immune responses. Wildtype (WT) mice were compared to H4R Knockout (KO) or Histamine deficient (HDC KO) mice in oxazolone and DSS colitis. In addition, mast cell -deficient (SASH) mice reconstitute d with either WT or HDC KO bone marrow -derived mast cells were compared in oxazolone colitis. For oxazolone colitis, 8 - 10-week -old male mice were sensitized on the shaved abdomen with 3% oxazolone followed 7 days later by intra -rectal administration of 1% oxazolone. For DSS colitis, 8 -10 week -old female mice were fed 3.5% DSS for 6 days. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss, diarrhea, and rectal bleeding. Mice were euthanized after 3 days for oxazolone colitis and 9 days for DSS colitis. Colonic length was measured and colonic tissue was form alin fixed for H&E and IHC. RNA and protein were isolated from colonic lysates and analyzed by RT -PCR and ELISA respectively. Results: Compared to WT mice, H4R KO or HDC KO mice had significantly reduced weight loss, disease activity, colonic shortening, a nd histologic severity in either colitis model. H4R KO and HDC KO mice had significantly reduced colonic IL -6, CXCL1 (KC), & CXCL2 (MIP2), molecules important for recruitment of neutrophils. In accordance, the colonic tissue of H4R KO mice reduced inf iltrating myeloperoxidase -staining neutrophils in the mucosa. Despite the significant impact on intestinal damage and overall health, H4R KO and HDC KO mice had a normal Th2 adaptive response in oxazolone colitis, characterized by normal expression of IL -4 and IL -13. SASH mice reconstituted with HDC KO mast cells had significantly reduced weight loss, disease activity, colonic shortening, and histologic severity in oxazolone colitis in addition -6, CXCL1 , & CXCL2 . the mast cell -derived histamine acts via H4R to regulate colonic inflammation through regulation of the innate immune response via promoting neutrophilic inflammation in the colonic mucosa through IL -6, CXCL1, and/or CXCL2.

Immunofluorescent microscopy can detect proteins of interest within tissue, from structural proteins to phen otypic markers expressed on individual cells. To perform reliable statistical analysis of microscopic images, a large image set is required. The analysis of this data poses several problems including time of analysis, software costs, and user bias. Method : Our laboratory has been generating algorithms in the Interactive Data Language for batch processing of images. Of particular interest is the structural layout of epithelial barriers at sites of HIV transmission and location of target immune cells within tissue. Typically, to measure the thickness of the epithelium in an image, a user arbitrarily selected a handful of points on one boundary and their apparent nearest point on the other boundary. This approach does not guarantee fair sampling and relies on the user's ability to identify shortest distances. The user then performed simple averaging statistics on those few data points. Results: Our algorithm enables the user to define the region boundaries and then collects 100x to 1000x more epithelial thickn ess values per image in a few seconds. This method yields more precise measurements and unbiased thickness sampling and has an added advantage: collecting these measurements allows for high -order statistical analysis, beyond simple averages. Standard devia tion of thickness is a simple measure of tissue irregularity, for example. Furthermore, the user can select cells of interest in the same tissue and separate them into classes by their marker expression. The locations of these cell populations can then be calculated in hundreds of images with high speed. Conclusion: The algorithms we present have been used to characterize the thickness of inner and outer foreskin, environments where HIV transmission to males can occur [1]. Funding: BMG OPP1031734 1.

Numerous studies using large cell populations determined that active genes promoters tend to be nucleosome-depleted. We developed a method to examine nucleosome positioning in single cells and revealed significant heterogeneity of nucleosome configurations within a population. In an inactive gene loaded with nucleosomes, a small subpopulation of nucleosome-depleted cells exists that were engaged in transcription. Single cell mapping revealed that even in apparently nucleosome-free regions, some cells were occupied by nucleosomes. These data reveal an underlying complexity of nucleosome positioning and its role in regulating gene expression. Method: Here we describe a technique to determine nucleosome positioning at specific loci in single cells utilizing GpC methylation protection followed by bisulfite sequencing in S. cerevisiae and are currently expanding this technique to multiple myeloma. Results: Using the inducible PHO5 gene, we find that significant heterogeneity in nucleosome position exists within a cell population and shifts in nucleosome positioning correlate with changes in gene expression. Additionally, we examined several mutant PHO5 strains that introduce either a poly (dA:dT) tract or alter the dinucleotide periodicity. Mutants that stimulate gene expression shift in nucleosomes positioning similar to when PHO5 expression is induced. Intriguingly, mutations that reduced gene expression demonstrated a shift to cells with more stabilized nucleosome positioning suggesting that the alteration in periodicity antagonizes chromatin remodelers. Finally, we determined the considerable heterogeneity of nucleosomes in two loci that have previously been described as \"fuzzy\" illustrating that this method can be utilized to deconvolute heterogeneous populations. We are now expanding our investigation to the heterogeneity of nucleosomes in multiple myeloma. Specifically, this study focuses on promoters of genes that are differentially expressed depending upon the level of expression of the histone methyltransferease MMSET, which overexpressed in a subset of the disease associated with particularly poor prognosis. Conclusions: Our work demonstrates a method for mapping nucleosomes at the single-cell level. We are now able to identify the heterogeneity within cells at positions that previously could only be described as \"fuzzy\". Specifically, we found that \"fuzziness\" may in part be due to more conformations of nucleosomes, but also a combination of conformations over a larger region as well as a considerable population entirely lacking a nucleosome in a particular region. We have also provided strong, direct evidence for a correlation between nucleosome occupancy and gene expression. Understanding nucleosome shifts in individual cells will likely provide fruitful information as epigenetic changes are recognized as causes for cancer and other diseases. Indeed, our method provides new insight into nucleosome locations, and likely changes in nucleosome occupancy in a specific population of cells could result in detrimental changes in gene expression that previously could not be determined.

Proinflammatory conditions have been detected preceding the onset of epilepsy in both patients and animal models. Recurrent or prolonged seizures lead to activation of immune responses, which further increase seizure susceptibility. We therefore characterized different populations of brain-resident and -infiltrating immune cells in resections of brain tissues from pediatric patients with epilepsy and determined their differentiation and activation statuses. We then adopted a two-hit murine model to recapitulate the clinical findings by inducing status epilepticus. Objective: to delineate the specific roles of innate and adaptive immunity in the process of epileptogenesis. Methods: Freshly resected human brain tissues were processed to generate single cell suspension suitable for flow cytometric analyses. The cell preparation was then stained with fluorescently labeled cell markers for identification of different populations of cells. Similar analyses were performed in brain samples of inbred mice that were induced to develop status epilepticus with two hits. The first hit was either kainic acid delivered peritoneally or hyperthermia at post-natal day 14. The second hit was another dose of kainic acid at post-natal day 28. Results: We detected brain-infiltrating monocytes, macrophages, T cells, T cells, and T regulatory cells in the resected brain of patients and C57Bl/6 mice subjected to two-hit induced status epilepticus. About 25 percent of the brain-infiltrating T cells were of lineage. These T are thought to be activated by alarm signals such as heat shock proteins following stress. This cell subset is considered to be a bridge between innate and adaptive responses as it permits rapid immune responses to a variety of invariant foreign antigens, and yet displaying limited T-cell receptor rearrangement. They may also serve as antigen-presenting cells to activated conventional T cells. The remaining 75 percent of infiltrating T cells were stained positive for the T-cell receptor. Interestingly, majority of these T cells were memory cells that are capable of homing to peripheral secondary lymphoid organs, as indicated by their surface expression of CD45RO and CCR7. Furthermore, these memory cells are capable of undergoing antigen-independent and homeostatic self-renewal, as they express CD127, the interleukin-7 receptor subunit. Conclusion: Our preliminary human studies demonstrated for the first time that peripheral leukocytes infiltrate pediatric epileptic cortical tissues. Most importantly, we developed a two hit murine model to recapitulate the clinical findings by inducing febrile seizures in post-natal day 14 mice pups followed by a kainic acid-induced secondary seizure. We have shown marked increase of peripheral lymphocytes, specifically activated and memory T lymphocytes, in the mouse brain, consistent with our human data.

In this study, w e investigate different data discretization methods combined with popular machine learning algorithms to derive platform -independent and accurate multi - gene signatures for molecular classification of tumor samples . Objective: Molecular stratificat ion of tumors is essential for developing personalized therapies. While patient stratification strategies have been successful , computational methods to accurately translate gene signature s derived from high -throughput platform s to clinically adaptable low -dimensional platform s are currently lacking . We perform comparati ve evaluation of different data discretization methods to derive accurate and platform -independent gene signatures for molecular classification of tumors. Methods: Isoform -level gene expre ssion estimates, fold -change expression (tumor over normal) values, and molecular sub type information were obtained for 342 and 155 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) samples profiled by . A subset of 76 GBM sampl es ha s expression profiles from both RNA -seq and exon -array platforms . The subtype information or class labels were obtained from our recently published study (Pal et al., NAR. 2014). For variable selection, we employed two algorithms based on support vect or machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) methods , which are available as R package s 'mSVM -RFE' and 'varSelRF ,' respectively. Utilizing the features selected by these two methods, we transform ed the fold change data to discretiz ed values by using both equal width and equal frequency binning. Four classification methods \u2014SVM, RF, then adopted to predict a subtype of the GBM samples . Prediction results for independent platforms were reported base d on the 76 common samples were used to evaluate the performance of platform transition . Results: We found that equal frequency discretization improved the classification accuracy more than applying fold change values directly or equal width binning discretization . Using the SVM -RFE variable selection SVM correctly predic ted all the 76 (100%) discretization, SVM achieve d only 53 % accuracy. With variable selection by varS elRF, SVM slightly outperform ed with an discretiz ation improve d classifiers' perform ance when considering data from different platforms . Also, the RF based feature selection method outperformed the SVM based method requiring a small number of features to achiev e a high accuracy (> 90%). Conclusions: Integrative application of feature selection and data discretization is crucial for platform transition and higher accuracy of the molecular classifiers . We found that equal frequency d iscretization technique coupled with a right choice of classifi cation method s could derive platform -independent gene signatures for molecular classification of tumor patients . Based on the features chosen by the variable selection methods as well as the different data formats, both SVM and RF outperform ed other classifier s with higher prediction accuracy than other classifiers .

Once in the cell the HIV capsid, co mposed of the viral protein p24, disassembles by a process called uncoating to release a viral complex containing RNA and reverse transcriptase (RT). Previous work in our lab has shown that the half -life of uncoating is 1 hour and the kinetics of this proc ess can be extended or shortened by p24 mutations that alter capsid stability. Furthermore, mutations in p24 can alter the process of reverse transcription and inhibiting reverse transcription delays uncoating despite no obvious direct interaction between the capsid and RT. In this work we tested the ability of the capsid binding drugs PF74 and BI2 to block infection, and determined if this block involves changes in uncoating. In time of addition experiments both drugs were able to block a majority of HI V-1 infectivity for 6 hours or longer, which is well past the observed half life of uncoating. Mutations in p24 modestly affected these resistances, with the exception of 5Mut, a 5 amino acid mutation selected for resistance to PF74. In addition, certain concentrations of PF74 inhibited RT activity while BI2 had no effect. These results suggest a more complicated role of p24 in the early stages of infection than previously known. Since these drugs do not alter uncoating, it suggests that p24 may be associa ted with the viral complex following uncoating.

Summary : The histone demethylase UTX participates in the activation of gene expression by removing the H3K27me3 repressive histone mark (trimethylation on and deletions are found in up to 30% of the cases of multiple myeloma (MM); nevertheless, the epigenetic impact and target genes of UTX in the MM cell, and the mechanisms by which UTX loss contributes to this disease remain to be elucidated. Objective: the purpose of this study was to characterize the alteration in the epig enetic landscape, gene expression and biological properties that the loss of U TX promotes in MM. Moreover, we wanted to investigate whether these effects could be reversed with the use of EZH2 inhibitors (EZH2i). Methods : UTX expression was added back to mutant MM cell lines by transduction with a retroviral vector harboring a doxycycline -inducible UTX. Levels of histone methylation were quantified by mass -spectrometry in the panel of cell lines and add back systems. The growth rate and clonogenicity were determined by cell count and soft agar assays. The cell cycle distribution and percentage of apoptotic cells was analyzed by BrDU incorporation and Annexin V detection. Finally, the ability of migration in response to SDF1 - was determine d by transwell migration assays. We used RNA -Seq to determine the genes that were responsive to a change in UTX levels and single locus ChIP to determine the levels of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 at specific loci. Sensitivity to EZH2 levels was determined by treating MM cells with the inhibitor GSK343 or an inactive compound (GSK669) followed by cell counting and Annexin V assays. Results : UTX deletion in MM cell lines was not associated with a global increase in the levels of H3K27me 3, indicating that its loss likely has a locus -specific effect . RNA -Seq data from two isogenic cell lines (with and without UTX) and an inducible add-back system revealed about 1,200 genes which expression was altered in response to UTX. Many of these genes were involved in the regulation of cell adhes ion and related pathways such the cadherin, the integrin the Wnt pathway. Re-expression of UTX in UTX -mutant cell lines slowed the proliferation rate and decreased the size and number of clones formed in soft agar. Moreov er, UTX expression decreased the migration rate and altered the adhesion properties of MM cells . This was consistent with the decreased E-cadherin levels we observed upon UTX loss, what has been associated in previous works with the progression of MM. Interestingly, t reatment of the pane l of MM cell lines with EZH2i showed that UTX mutant cell s were more sensitive to EZH2i than the wild-type MM cell lines , suggesting that the gain of H3K27me3 at specific loci upon UTX loss is relevant fo r the malignancy of these cells . In fact, treatment with EZH2i rescued the expression of genes that were repressed in the absence of UTX, such as E -cadherin, suggesting that the treatment with th ese inhibitors may render similar effects than adding back UTX to these cells and, therefore , may be considered a s a potential treatment for this type of MM. Conclusions : UTX loss epigenetically alters gene expression of MM cells to promote properties that may favor the progression of the disease, such as increased migration, clonogenicity, proliferation and altered adhesion. Loss of UTX increases the sensitivity of MM cells to EZH2i, suggesting that these inhibitors, already in clinical trials, may represent a rationale therapy for the treatment of this type of MM.

Department: Nephrology/FCVRI Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public ett@northwestern.edu Title: Neuropilin -1 in and retinal vascular patterning Objective : Neuropilin -1 (Nrp-1), a co -receptor for a variety of growth factors, is critical for the development and patterning of the vascular and nervous systems. Nrp -1 is expressed in many cell types including neurons, endothelial, vascular smooth muscle, tumor, immune and hematopoietic cells. It has been previously demonstrated that Nrp -1 is critical for the guidance of endo thelial tip cells, although the role Nrp -1 in pericytes in developing vascular beds is incompletely understood. In the kidney, Nrp -1 is expressed in a specialized perivascular cell known as the mesangial cell. We have sought to determine the contribution of Nrp -1 in these perivascular cells in vivo utilizing conditional deletion strategies. Methods: Selective deletion of Nrp -1 in perivascular cells was achieved by breeding mice with a loxP -flanked Nrp -1 gene to mice expressing Cre -recombinase under the co ntrol of the PDGFRb protomotor. Renal parameters, including histopathology, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate were monitored at various time points between postnatal day 5 and 33. Retinal vascula r development was observed by whole -mount immunof luorescence and confocal microscopy, and features of persistent fetal vascula r syndrome observed using histological techniques. Results: In contrast to global and endothelial cell selective deletion of Nrp -1, mice lacking Nrp -1 in perivascular cells surviv e to birth but die within 5 w eeks of age. Proteinuria was increased 10-fold in showed mesangial expansion, thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, increased pr esence of immature glomeruli and cystic dilatation in the mutants. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated profound defects in matrix pr oduction in mutant glomeruli. Protein expression of laminin a1, a5, b2 and agrin, matrix proteins typical ly obse rved in the GBM, was upregulated within the mesangium of mutant mice. In the developing vasculature of the retina, lack of Nrp -1 in pericytes lead to pronounced growth and patterning de fects . At postnatal day 5, control retinal vasculature migrat ed across over 70% of the reti na, while mutant vasculature migrated only 30% (P<0.0001). Additionally, patterning of the vasculature in the mutant was disorganized with lack of larger vessels, increased d ensity of capillaries, and observed cross -overs of arteries and veins. The delayed retinal vasculature expansion in mutant mice cause d persistence of the hyaloidal vessels, the fetal vessels which support the vitreous and retina prior to retinal vessel development. This persistent fetal vasculature also coincides with leukocoria , defects in the iris and ret ina detachments, which are observed in mutant eyes. Conclusions: Lack of N rp-1 in perivascular cells lead to the development of renal failure within 5 weeks of age, with expansion and pronounced matrix deposition in th e mesangium. Additionally, retinal vasculature outgrowth was delayed by the absence of Nrp -1 in pericytes , leading to persistent fetal vasculature syndrome. These studies suggest of potential role of Nrp - 1 in nephropathy conditions such diabetic nephropathy or IgA nephropathy, where mesangial expansion and matrix deposition are hallmark features of the disease pathophysiology . Furthermore, these studies h ighlight a previously unidentified role of perivascular cells in migration of the va scular front, and suggest a critical role of Nrp -1 in communication between pericytes and endothelial cells.

One likely mechanism mediating pathogenesis is excessive repression induced by the expanded ATXN -1. Because ATXN1 binds HDAC3, a class I histone deacetylase that we have found to be required for ATXN1 -induced transcriptional repression, w e tested whether genetically depleting HDAC3 improves the phenotype of the SCA1 knock -in mouse (SCA1154Q/2Q), the most physiologically relevant model of SCA1. Given that HDAC3 null mice are embryoni c-lethal, we used for our analyses a combination of HDAC3 haplo -insufficient and Purkinje cell-specific HDAC3 null mice. Although deleting a single allele of HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 was insufficient to improve cerebellar and cognitive deficits of the disease, a complete loss of Purkinje cell HDAC3 was highly deleterious both behaviorally, with mice showing early onset ataxia, and pathologically, with progressive histological evidence of degeneration. Inhibition of HDAC3 may yet have a role in SCA1 th erapy, but our study provides cautionary evidence that this approach could produce untoward effects. Indeed, the neurotoxic consequences of HDAC3 depletion could prove relevant wherever pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC3 is being contemplated, in disorders ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. Objective: To examine the effects of knocking down HDAC3 in the context of SCA1 and to study the role of HDAC3 in cerebellar disease model and Pcp2 promotor -driven Cre mice that specifically knock down HDAC3 only in PCs. Motor coordination and Memory functions were tested using accelerating Rotarod and Morris Water Maze test to assess the changes in behavioral phenotypes in these mice. We also perform bioch emical and histological analysis to examine the histopathological phenotypes. Results: The result showed that global genetic knock down of HDAC3 in SCA1 knock -in mouse is insufficient to rescue the severe SCA1 behavioral and his topathological deficits. However, mice with complete ablation of HDAC3 in cerebellar PCs show early sign of ataxia and progressive cerebellar degeneration. These mice also show motor function deficits as early as two months of age, well before the change i n Purkinje cell numbers was observed . This suggests that HDAC3 plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and functions of these cells, and that HDAC3 depletion in PCs could result in many neurotoxic consequences. Conclusion: Our results have imp ortant implications for therapy aimed at HDAC3 depletion in the context of SCA1, particularly since the side effects overlap with the symptoms of the disease. Similar considerations are relevant not only to neurodegenerative diseases, but also to cancer th erapy. Given the promise of HDAC inhibitors for a wide range of conditions, considerable effort should be made on discerning the deleterious consequences of HDAC inhibition and mitigating side effects by delineating the therapeutic window. It is possible t hat strategies such as pulse -dosing, the use of lower -dose cocktails of several HDAC inhibitors or their use in combination with other agents might also help avoid neuronal side effects of this promising class of epigenetic modifiers.

This decline is associated with the decrease in neural progenitor cell (NPC) proliferation in the hippocampus, the center for novel learning and memory acquisition. Several signaling pathways have been implicated in the control of neurogenesis in the adult subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family. Co -modulation of BMP4 and its antagonist, noggin, control SGZ lineage progression and neurogenesis. In normal aging, levels of BMP4 increase over a life time, which correlates with both the decline in neurogenesis and age-related cognitive decline. Previous findings indicate that shifting the equilibrium of BMP signaling is a critical modulator of baseline cognitive function and adaptive response to the en vironment. Regulating this signaling system is a potential target for preventing or reversing cognitive changes associated with aging Objective: Observations suggest that BMP signaling regulates adult neurogenesis and cognition, and that aging -related ch anges in BMP signaling could be involved in age -associated cognitive decline. Our objective is to evaluate BMP signaling in the aging brain, it's impact on aging -related cognitive decline, and it's role as a therapeutic target against the aging brain. Sample: Wild type (C57B6) mice aged 2 - to 18 - months were used in these experiments. Methods: Levels of proliferation were analyzed using immunohistochemistry for specific lineage and cell cycle markers (DCX, BrdU, Ki67). BMP signaling was analyzed using p rotein and RNA samples extracted specifically from the dentate gyrus (DG). Lenti -viruses expressing secreted forms of and Noggin were stereotactically injected into the DG of young (2 month) and old (12 month) C57B6 mice. Ten-, 14- or 28 days after v irus injection, hippocampus -dependent behavior was analyzed with Novel Object Recognition tests . Following behavior testing the brains were analyzed using IHC for proliferation and lineage specific markers. Results: Analysis of BMP levels in mice through out aging exposes changes to cellular mechanisms and enhancement of the BMP signaling pathway beginning at 9 months. Furthermore, viral mediated over-expression of BMP4 at 2 months old decreases levels of proliferation in the SGZ of adult mice and impairs hippocampus -dependent behavior , similarly to that seen in aging . Preliminary studies into blocking BMP signaling in aged mice (12 months) shows a positive trend on improving cell proliferation and cognitive performance. Conclusions: In normal aging, neurogenesis and cognitive behavior gradually decline, which correlates with an increase in BMP signaling. O verexpression of BMP4 in the DG of young mice also reduces proliferation, the number of immature neurons and impairs their behavior, similar to that se en in aging . Furthermore, overexpressing Noggin in aged mice appears to reverse these cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Taken together, these findings indicate a shift in the equilibrium of BMP signaling is critical for modulating neurogenesis and cogni tive function with age. Presenting Author: Mrinal Y.

MMSET overexpression in MM leads to an increase in histone 3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2), and a decrease 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). This altered epigenetic landscape is accompanied by changes in proliferation, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility. Prior work linked methylation of histones, including H3K36, to the ability of cells to undergo DNA damage repair. In addition, t(4;14)+ patients frequently relapse after regimens that include DNA damage-inducing agents, suggesting that MMSET might play a role in DNA damage repair and response. Objective: To determine the role of MMSET in DNA damage repair in multiple myeloma. Methods: For our studies, we used U2OS cells engineered to express the AsiSI enzyme fused to an estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain. Upon tamoxifen treatment, double strand breaks (DSBs) are induced at multiple AsiSI recognition sites. MMSET siRNA knockdown in these cells was used to determine the role of MMSET in both non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR), and we also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) at DSB sites to determine how MMSET altered recruitment of DNA repair proteins. To study the effect of MMSET in MM, we used the t(4;14)+ KMS11 cell line, NTKO, and genetically matched TKO cells in which the overexpressed MMSET allele was knocked out. Cells were treated with various DNA damaging agents and cell proliferation and cell cycle assays were performed. DNA damage levels were measured by the comet assay and DNA damage kinetics were measured by high-throughput cell phenotyping. Finally, a xenograft mouse model was used to show that MMSET provides a viable therapeutic target. Results: In U2OS cells, we showed that cells with MMSET deficiency had reduced efficiency of NHEJ and HR, suggesting that MMSET is necessary in both types of repair. Upon DSB induction, we found that with depletion of MMSET, H2AX (an indicator of DNA damage) persisted at the cut site and there was a decrease in some DNA repair proteins at the DSB, suggesting that MMSET is required for protein recruitment. In MM cells, we found that NTKO cells had elevated levels of DNA damage at baseline compared to TKO. Upon addition of a DNA damaging agent, NTKO cells survived better than TKO cells and could repair damage at an enhanced rate, whereas TKO cells entered cell cycle arrest. Kinetic studies showed that DNA damage occurred more frequently in proliferative phases of the cell cycle (S and G2-M) as compared to G0-G1. Finally, KMS11 cells harboring doxycycline-inducible MMSET shRNA were injected into nude mice. After one week, mice were treated with doxycycline and injected with melphalan or saline. Knockdown of MMSET or melphalan treatment alone decreased tumor growth but eventually all mice developed tumors. Only when MMSET was knocked down and chemotherapy given were the mice rendered tumor free. Conclusions: MMSET is important in multiple pathways of DNA repair and is necessary to recruit some DNA repair proteins to sites of damage. MM cells with high levels of MMSET can survive better and repair DNA damage faster after insult compared to cells with low MMSET, which becomes more apparent in an in vivo model. These findings indicate a new mechanism for MMSET in DNA repair in MM and identify it as a therapeutic target in MM and other cancers.

Limit one page . Formatting follows: Title : [The role of alpha -catenin in tight junctions ] Extracellular Ca++ modulates the formation of cadherin -based adherens and tight junctions. In low Ca++ adhesive interactions between extracellular domains of cadherin are disrupted. It results in disassembly of adherens junctions. In this study using polariz ed epithelial cells, we show that some cells maintain tight junction complexes even when cadherin -based adhesion is lost in low Ca++. By contrast, disassembly of adherens junctions by shRNA of alpha -catenin, one of the cadherin -associate d proteins, leads to a complete loss of tight junctions. These results indicate that tight junctions can form in the absence of functional cadherin but not in the absence of alpha -catenin. Our aim is to determine the mechanism of how alpha -catenin is invol ved in tight junctions formation. Presenting Author: Jeffrey R.

Mucins li ne the female reproductive tract and act as a barrier to microbial infections. An tibodies are produced by the body in respons e to pathogens such as influenza, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and h epatitis C virus (HCV) . These d isease s affect the state to which antibodies are glycosylated. Whereas G0's represent a lower order glyc an structure correlating to a pro -inflammatory state, higher order antibody glycan structures such as G2's correlate to an anti -inflammatory state. In addition these antibodies can also be fucosylated, further differentiating potential glycan states. On e mucin found in cervical vaginal mucus is MUC16 . Binding of MUC16 to IgG from HIV chronically infected individuals is increased 2 -3 fold relative to the binding of IgG in healthy individuals. We are currently working to define the antibody characteristi cs associated with specific binding to MUC16. Objective: The objective of this study is to decipher which sub -population of HIV IgG is important for binding MUC16 and how these antibodies could be used to sequester incoming virions to the mucus and enh ance vaccine function . Methods: Utilizing a cell line derived from ovarian cancer cells, OVCAR -3, we isolated full - length MUC16. We probed MUC16 via an enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay for to HIV IgG derived from pooled serum of HIV-infec ted patients as as . Glycosylation states for binding via coomassie . Antibody glycosylation measured via mass spectrometry. Results: IgG sub s that (G0) and fucose -contiaing had increased MUC16 binding via ELISA , flow cytometry, and tosylated magnetic bead capture assay. In addi tion macaque antibodies th at bound tightly to MUC16 had elevated binding to SIV antigens, particularly GP41. Conclusions: Understanding the glycosylation state of HIV IgG antibodies t hat bind to the mucin -microenvironment of cervical mucus and cervical vaginal mucus will aid our understanding of HIV infection . It would be expected that an increase in these mucin -binding antibodies would decrease HIV infection, as they would tether th e virus to mucins and prevent infection .

Uncoating is required for viral replication, yet the mechanistic deta ils of the process remain unclear. It is also unknown whether all of the p24CA protein in the capsid dissociates during uncoating. Here we have examined the effects of p24CA mutants on capsid integrity and uncoating in HIV -1 infected cells. We also have studied the suscepti bility of HIV to two drugs that bind the viral capsid. Objective: To study the effect of p24CA mutations on HIV -1 capsid integrity and uncoating in different cell types. To examine the effect of two capsid binding drugs on HIV -1 infectiv ity in relation to the process of uncoating. Methods: We recently developed the CsA washout assay in which TRIM -CypA mediated restriction of viral replication wa s used to study the kinetics of uncoating in HIV -1 infected owl monkey kidney (OMK) cells and a HeLa cell line engineered to express TRIM -CypA. The capsid integrity of HIV -1 was tested using the fluorescence microscopy based TRIM capture assay in which GFP serves as a fluid phase marker in the capsid interior. A drug addition assay in parallel wit h the CsA washout assay was used to test the kinetics of HIV -1 drug susceptibility. Results: Using t he CsA washout assay we determined that p24CA mutations can significantly rate of uncoating (A92E), delay uncoating (E45A, N74D, Q63/67A), or have no effect (G94D). The N74D mutation resulted in a significantly greater delay in uncoating in HeLa cells expressing TRIM -CypA compared to OMK cells. N74D and Q63/67A had altered capsid integrity and the addition of cyclosporine A seemed to stabilize Q 63/67A capsids. The half -life of uncoating was 1.5 hours yet drug treatment still decreased HIV infectivity at 8 -12 hours post - infection. We also did not observe a shift in drug susceptibility for p24CA mutant viruses that was consistent with their alterat ion in uncoating kinetics. the p24CA mutants provide an in vivo measure of the extent to which alterations in uncoating kinetics can be tolerated. The greater delay in uncoating of the N74D mu tant virus in HeLa cells suggests that cellular factors can also impact uncoating . In addition to altering uncoating kinetics, p24CA mutations can also change capsid integrity. Finally, a s HIV was susceptible to capsid binding drugs for hours beyond the ob served half -life of uncoating, these results suggest that a subset of p24CA may remain associated with the viral complex after disassembly of the conical capsid.

To date, there is no robust method to track follicles/oocytes during the course of development in vivo . In this study, we generated a triple transgenic mouse in which oocyte - specific promoters ( Vasa , Gdf-9 and Zp3), active at distinct stages of oocyte and follicle development, drive the expression of genes encoding exogenous fluorescent proteins (EGFP, mCherry and AmCyan, respectively). Objective: The objective of this study was to generate a reporter line in which the fluorescent profile can be used to follow follicle development and ovarian dynamics. Methods: The mice were generated by pronuclear microinjection 1:1:1 ratio of the three independent DNA constructs (injection s performed by NU Transgenic Core). The co -injection resulted in random insertion of exogenous DNA into the mouse genome and 9 independent transgenic lines were generated - 1 double and 8 triple transgenic founders. We then selected a line (#5570) in which the 3 transgenes segregated together after 4 generations and that had relatively robust expression for all three transgenes. Results: We examined the expression pattern of the promoter -driven fluorescent proteins in ovaries from different age mice and fo und a follicle -class dependent pattern consistent with prior studies using Vasa, Gdf -9, and Zp3 promoters. We examined the expression intensity of the oocytes and found that levels differed even within follicle classes, suggesting an underlying activity or intrinsic stratification of function not previously appreciated. Additionally, marked differences in intensity of signal, in the same follicle class, could be identified at different ages during the pre -pubertal period. Finally, we used the mouse line to examine the location of the first wave of follicle activation in the postnatal mouse. The first activated/growing follicles appear on the dorsal side of the ovary in a relatively posterior location (on the ovarian side nearest the rete ovarii). Conclusio ns: Our triple transgenic mice represent the first oocyte specific reporter lineage in which the signal of fluorescent proteins can be use to follow oocyte gene activity and follicle activation. This transgenic mouse line will be an important tool for expa nding our basic understanding of the mechanisms controlling follicle activation, selection and ovarian developmental dynamics. Similar utility may be found in the male offspring.

Currently, islets are transplanted into the liver; however , inability to engineer the local microenvironment to support islet function has limited the success of the therapy. We have developed porous poly(lactide -co-glycolide) (PLG) scaffold s as a platform for islet transplantation in the mouse, and are able to reverse diabetes with a fractio n of the islets isolated from a pancreas. However, islet acceptance requires systemic immunosuppression, which increases risk of infection and cancer. In the following studies, we sought to control the immune response to transplanted islets by engineering the scaffold TGF. Methods: PLG center disk containing lyophilized TGF. Islets were then seeded onto TGF loaded scaffolds and implanted into hyperglycemic mice in an allogeneic transplant model. Blood glucose levels of mice were measured daily. Time to graft rejection was measured as the time point where blood glucose levels rebounded above 200mg/dL for two consecutive days . Scaffolds were explanted on day 7 and immune cell populations w ere analyzed using flow cytometry. Results : The data showed that TGF significantly i ncreased graft rejection times , compared with scaffolds that did not release TGF (blank scaffolds). Graft protection on TGF scaffolds was due in part to reduced immune cell i nfiltration; i n particular, NK1.1, F4/80, and CD11c cell infiltration was significantly reduced as compared with blank scaffolds. Interestingly, TGF delivery did not increase the number of CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T -cells (Tregs) within the graft, a type of T -cell that has been shown to have immunosuppressive functions . Conclusions : These studies demonstrate the ability to modulate the local immune environment surrounding the graft through controlled TGF release from a scaffold. Our ini tial hypothesis for TGF prolonging graft survival was that TGF increased proliferation of Tregs within the graft , which did not match with our flow cytometry data. Future studies will attempt to further study the mechanism by which TGF increases graft survival, as well as identifying additional factors that can promote long -term graft survival.

With the very dynamic nature of epige nome and much reduced cost in microarray and sequencing experiments, more and more researchers are now studying epigenome at multiple time points, i.e. multiple measurement s and/or longitudinal study design . However, the popular site -by-site multiple testi ng as commonly used in genome -wide studies may impair the value of multiple measurements because it leads to underpowered analyses by ignoring the inherent dependent structure . Objective: To address the statistical challenges including multiple comparison issue in epigenome -wide multiple measure ments data and enhance the statistical power by incorporating the underlying dependent structure . Sample: The development of this analytical framework was motivated by epigenome -wide repeated measured micro RNA expression data on 240 samples collected at two examination days with 1 -2 week i nterval from 120 study subjects in Beijing Truck Driver Air Pollution Study . Results: We have proposed a p enalized regression model incorporating with grid search method (PGS), for analyzing epigenome -wide multiple measurement s data. Comparisons between PGS and the traditional site-by-site testing approach using Generalize d Estimation Equation (GEE) or Linear Mixed Model (LMM) reveal that PGS provides 10% smaller phenotype predicti on errors (Figure 1 ) and 57% higher enrichment of phenotype -related biological pathway (Figure 2 ) than the traditional site-by-site testing approach (GEE/LMM) . Conclusions : PGS is suitable fo r epigenome -wide multiple measurement s/longitudinal design in that, by exploiting underlying dependent structures, it circumvents multiple testing issues and provides more accurate and more meaningful biomarkers that associated with the phenotype of intere st. Our approach is also useful for epigenome -wide multiple measurements data of DNA methylation and histone modifications. Presenting Author: Diana , , Platanias , MD, PhD Department: Robert H.

Previous studies have shown that the Type I IFN receptor engage s pathways downstream of mTOR signaling , but the precise roles of downst ream mTOR effector pathways in the generation of IFN established . ULK1 differentiation , axon growth. As ULK1 provides a link between mTOR signaling and autophagy pathways, we determined its potential involvement in IFN /-mediated signaling. Our results demonstrate that ULK1 is required for IFN -stimulated gene transcription via IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and IFN activation site elements (GAS) . We also identify for the first time p38 as a novel downstream effector of ULK1 in IFN signaling . Furthermore, we provide evidence that ULK1 is essential for IFN -mediated anti -proliferative effects o n several cells lines, and is essential for the generation of Type I IFN responses in vitro against malignant erythroid precursors from patients with Polycythemia V era. These data reveal a novel biological role of ULK1 as a crucial mediator of IFN/-induced signaling and antineoplastic responses. Presenting Author: [Jung Kim M.B/Ph.D. ] Department: Medicine ] Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health metabolism through miR200c Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is crucial component that is required for prostate cancer to initiate and progress growth. DHT can be derived from both testoster one and cholesterol . During prostate cancer progression, these metabolism pathway enzymes are deregulated to accumulate DHT, more potent androgen receptor (AR) agonist. TMPRSS2 -ERG is found in approximately 50% of prostate cancer patients, where TMPRSS2, a ndrogen regulated gene, promoter is fused with ERG through chromosomal rearrangement. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a small non -coding RNA that is often deregulated in cancer through translational repression or mRNA degradation. MiR -200c is one of the widely studied miRNA as it has effect on epithelial - mesenchymal transition (EMT). In our study, we investigated how ERG regulates miR -200c and induces cancer progression. First, we utilized genome wide ChIP -seq and microRNA profiling to identified ERG regulated miRNAs. Through this analysis, we were able to identify miR -200c as a potential target of ERG. To validate, we looked at mature miR -200c level in VCaP ERG knockdown and LNCaP ERG overexpression cells. Furthermore, ChIP -qPCR and luciferase promoter assay validated the ERG occupancy at the miR -200c promoter. To further understand the functional role of miR -200c in prostate cancer, we performed cell invasion and migration. Both results showed that ERG induces cell invasion and migration as previously reported, yet with miR -200c overexpression , it can reverse the ERG induced cell invasion and migration. In addition, to identify novel miR -200c targets, we looked at GO analysis of ERG knockdown and miR-200c overexpression microarray. Surprisingly, we found that both ERG and miR -200c are associated with steroid and cholesterol biosynthetic and metabolic processes that are important for accumulation of DHT in prostate cancer. With this new observation, we would be able to reveal novel mechanism of miR -200c in prostate cance r.

Oncogenic mutations in RTKs and downstream signaling components such as HRasG12V and BRafV600E cause these pathways to remain aberrantly activated. Similarly, unrestrained signaling occurs through the inactivation of genes that inhibit RTK pathways, such a s down -regulation of the SPROUTY (SPRY ) genes. The epigenetic mechanisms that control the aberrant gene expression observed upon oncogenic RTK signaling remain poorly understood. Objective : To determine whether oncogenic RTK signaling leads to epigenetic reprogramming. Methods: To mimic uncontrolled RTK signaling seen in cancer , we deleted the Spry genes in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) . To drive unrestrained signaling through mutant signaling effectors, we stably transduced the mutant oncogenes, HRasG12V and BRafV600E, in MEFs . We performed RNA -sequencing (RNA -seq) to identify the deregulated genes upon Spry loss or oncogenic transformation . We also performed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP -seq) to globa lly examine the location of histone tail modifications associated with gene activation at promoters (H3K4me3) and enhancers (H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ), Results : Spry knockout Spry-/-) cells, compared to their wild -type ( Spry+/+) counterparts, display enhanced anchorage independent growth, accelerated cell cycle entry, and increased cell growth, consistent with the tumor suppressive activity of the Spry genes . Spry-/- cells are hypersensitive to several growth factor s and show significantly enhanced and prolonged activation of the Ras -Erk s ignaling cascade. RNA -seq revealed that the deregulated signaling upon Spry loss results in aberrant gene expression patterns. Spry -1, upregulating genes involved in promoting cellular migration and inflammation, that are never modulated in Spry+/+ cells. ChIP -seq for H3K27ac revealed that novel super -enhancers and enhanc er sites associated with these aberrantly upregula ted migratory and inflammatory genes are marked with H3K27ac upon Spry loss. This change in chromatin architecture is maintained in the quiescent cellular state and can be enhanc ed upon RTK network activation. Similar to Spry loss, o ncogenic transformation of Spry+/+ cells by H -RasG12V and B -RafV600E hyperactivates the Ras -Erk axis, results in deregulated gene expression of migratory and inflammatory genes , and leads to aberrant chromatin marking at super -enhancers and enhancers . Treatment of Spry-/- cells and H-RasG12V mutant cells with a Mek inhibitor (PD0325901) rescue s the deregulated gene expression and results in the loss of H3K27ac at super -enhancer and enhancer sites , indicating that persistent Ras-Erk signaling is required for the maintenance of thi s deregulated chromatin conformation. In addition, treatment of Spry-/- cells and H-RasG12V mutant cells with JQ1, a highly specific drug that inhibits the proteins that recognize the H3K27ac mark , rescue s the deregulated gene expression and significantly inhibits the growth of these cells . Conclusions : This work establishes a novel mechanism by which oncogenic Ras -Erk signaling deregulates gene expression through dynamic changes in the super -enhancer and enhancer landscape. Furthermore, this work suggests that JQ1 as well as drugs targeting the Ras-Erk axis should be considered when treating cancers driven by oncogenic RTK signaling.

Building on this HDL NP platform, this project seeks to modify the NP surface to develop particles capable of scavenging and therefore detoxifyi ng harmful lipophilic compounds . Among the agents we seek to target with our NP are b acterial lipopolys accharides (LPS) - highly potent compounds that are released during bacterial infection and that cause significant morbidity and mortality. Other molecul es that can be highly problematic are local anesthetics and neuromuscular -blocking agents used during surgery. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop nanoparticle -based options for the treatment of bacterial sepsis and drug overdose. Through modif ication of the lipid composition of the HDL NP we were able to significantly increase the binding affinity between the scavenger and the biotoxin s in vitro , suggesting that our HDL NP s might be active in detoxifying harmful agents in vivo . Future experimen ts focus on elucidating if our optimized bio -scavengers can successfully reduce the severe immune response observed in LPS -treated cells (one of the hallmarks of bacterial sepsis) , and if the particles can significantly reduce the plasma levels of anesthet ics and neuromuscular -blocking agents following overdose.

Recurrent herpes in blindness . HSV-1 utilizes two main entry receptors in animal models, nectin -1 and herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM). HSV- 1 infection of the eye uniquely depends on HVEM . HVEM is dispensable for infection via other routes or by HSV -2, a closely related virus , presumably because in these cases nectin -1 is sufficient for entry . However, HSV-1 infection was attenuated in H VEM knock -out (KO) m ice infected at the corneal surface. Objective: To further characterize the dependence of HSV -1 on HVEM in the eye, w e tested the ability of a mutant HSV -1 virus that cannot engage HVEM (HSV -1/17 7 -15) to produce disease after ocular infection in C57Bl /6 mice . In order to uncover any subtle differences in pathogenesis that may be masked in the HSV-resistant C57Bl/6 strain, we also tested our mutant virus in BALB/c mice, which are exquisitely sensitive to ocular HSV -1 Methods: /6 or BALB/c mice were infected via corneal scarification with either the HVEM -binding mutant ( 7-15), a virus which has HVEM binding restored (WT -FRT) , or the parental virus strain (HSV -1/17), and their clinical symptoms were monitored daily. Eye swabs were collected on days 1, 3, and 5 post -infection. Mice were sacrificed on day 5 and the b rain, perio cular skin (POS), and trigeminal ganglia (TG) were viral titers were determined . Results: The 7-15 virus produced disease similar to that caused by the rescue virus control (WT-FRT) and wild -type parental virus (HSV -1/17) in bot h mouse strains , although BALB/c mice suffered a greater burden of disease, as expected . C57Bl/6 mice had similar viral titers in POS, TG, and brain when infected with mutant, rescue, or parental virus (p>0.05 for all). Similarly, titers recovered from BAL B/c TG and POS did not differ significantly based on viral strain (p>0.05 for all). BALB/c mice infected with WT -FRT virus had higher titers in the brains compared to the 7-15 virus , but this result was only marginally significant (p=0. 0484 ). Titers from eye swabs were similar on all days for the WT -FRT and 7-15 virus (p>0.05), although HSV-1/17 produced significantly higher titers on days 1 and 5 in BALB/c mice (p<0.0001 , p=0.00069, respectively) and on all mice (p<0.0001, p=0.006377, p=0.000382, respectively). Conclusions: The HSV-1/17 7 -15 virus does not recapitulate the pathogenesis defect seen in the HVEM KO mice , in that the 7-15 virus produ ced equivalent titers to the rescue virus control in TG, POS, brains, and eye swabs of both HSV -susceptible and HSV -resistant mice . The mutant and rescue virus only differed significantly from the parental strain in eye swab titers, indicating that attenua tion was not impacting the r escue virus control. Therefore, t he course of infection was similar for all viruses tested. HVEM is a member of the tumor necrosis super - family, and has a complex role in immune responses beyond its function as a viral entry receptor. These functions may be disabled in the HVEM KO animal, but may not be significantly affected during infection with a virus that does not utilize HVEM for entry. The importance of HVEM in ocular HSV -1 pathogenesis may stem from its role as an immunom odulator, rather than from its function as an entry receptor.

FOXA1 is a pioneering transcription factor of the androgen receptor (AR) that is ind ispensible for the lineage -specific gene expression of the prostate . However, the mechanisms determining prostatic AR binding events by FOXA1 , the functions of FOXA1 in prostate cancer are incompletely understood. Results: We reveal that FOXA1 induces cell growth requiring the AR pathway. On the other hand, FOXA1 inhibits cell motility and epithelial -to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through AR - independent mechanisms. Using orthotopic mouse models we further show that FOXA1 inhibits prostate tumor metasta sis in vivo. Accordingly, FOXA1 expression is slightly up -regulated in localized prostate cancer wherein cell proliferation is the main feature, but is remarkably down - regulated when the disease progresses to metastatic stage for which cell migration and E MT would have been essential. Importantly, recently identified mutations of FOXA1 drastically attenuated its ability to suppress cell invasion. Furthermore, we found that FOXA1 opens up numerous chromatin regions to absorb AR through low -affinity interacti ons, resulting in the inhibition of high -affinity ARE -mediated AR -chromatin binding. Thus, loss of FOXA1 may lead to AR activation. Conclusions: These results demonstrated FOXA1 primarily as a suppressor of AR signaling and as a metastasis inhibitor and provide mechanisms by which recurrent FOXA1 mutations and disrupted equilibrium of FOXA1 / AR contribute to prostate cancer progression.

As the sole actin -binding component of the cadherin/catenin complex, alpha -catenin (-cat) is viewed as the key linker protein between cadherin and the actin cytoskel eton. Our lab has discovered a highly conserved phosphorylation domain of five serine/threonine residues in -cat that is situated just N - terminal to its F -actin -bindi ng si te. These phosphorylation sites lie proximal to the C -terminal end of the mechano -sensitive, auto -inhibitory region of that (Yonemura, 2010, NCB). Radioactive 32[P]-labeling s tudies in cultured cells confirm that these sites are the major targets of -cat phosphorylation. The contribution of the -cat phosphorylation domain to -cat adhesive function was examined through various cell -based assays, using MDCK cells that are knocked both WT mutant/mimic expressing cells rescue static adhesion. Ho wever, is it likely that dynamic assays are necessary to see the effects of phospho -mutation. Scratch -wound assays demonstrate that, compared to WT --cat, cells expressing phospho -mutant and -mimic forms of -cat display faster wound closure. Tracking of individual cell paths within the wound front, revealed that cells exp ressing both phospho -mutant or -mimic forms of -cat are more persistent in their movements , suggesting that phospho -mutants an d -mimics are weak loss of funct ion mutations. However, phospho - mimic (5E) -cat are possibly more connected in their movements (determined by comparing pair -wise trajectories of individual cells), suggesting that 5E may in fact function differently from phospho -mutant (5A) in specific assays. This finding is further supported by comparing the morphology of cells grown to confluence on high -pore-density filters. While WT - and 5E -expressing MDCK cells display a stereotypic hexagonal packing pattern that is characteristic of epithelial cel ls, 5A -expressing cells do not pack uniformly; suggesting that confluent packing of epithelial cells requires negative charge in the phosphorylation domain of - cat. 32[P]-ATP in vitro kinase assays on were performed on recombinant, purified GST -tagged -cat to demonstrate that our phosphorylation domain is targeted by and 2 . 641 is the site responsible for all CK2 phosphorylation. This site has a priming relationship to serine/threonine residues between 6 52-658 that is Interestingly, -906 -cat) reveals that CK1 sites are less accessible in the full -length - cat protein. Furthermore, the priming effect of the S641 site is minimized in aa459 -906 -cat, which demonstrates to vor CK1 phosphorylation. Partial trypsinolysis on recombinant purified -catenin demonstrates that, to WT and 5A forms of -cat, 5D -cat displays a novel digestion pattern. Importantly, in vitro phosphorylated WT --cat displays a digestion patter n that is identical to that of 5D (phospho - mimic) -cat, supporting the role of bona fide phosphorylation in altering the local conformation of -cat.

We sought to determine the mechanisms underlying the insensitivity of Th17 cells to GCs. We found that in vitro murine Th0, Th1 and Th2 cells, but not Th17 sensitive to GC -induced apoptosis. In addition, GCs suppressed IL -4, IFN -, and IL -22, but not IL -17 (A or F). Despite the distinct GC responses, Th subsets had comparable GC receptors. PCR array analysis, however, revealed significant differences in the apoptotic machinery between Th1 and Th17 cells. At baseline, Th17 cells had higher anti -apoptotic survivin and BCL2 and lower pro -apoptotic BIM than Th1 cells. Although GCs induced BIM in both Th1 and Th17 cells, the level of GC -induced BIM in Th1 cells was higher than in Th17 cells. GCs al so increased the anti -apoptotic GILZ in Th17 cells to a level higher than that in Th1 or Th2 cells. Furthermore, GCs decreased NOD1 and BCLXL in Th1 but not Th17 cells. These findings suggest that altered apoptotic machinery and differ ential gene regulation by GCs may underlie GC resistance of Th17 cells. These studies may provide a basis for improved treatment regimens for severe asthma and other Th17 mediated disorders.

Marina Casalino -Matsuda Position : Assistan t Investigator: Peter MD Department: Medicine/Pulmonary Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Hypercapnia, the elevation of CO 2 in blood and tissue, commonly occurs in advanced COPD and is associated with increased risk of pulmonary infections. We pre viously showed that hypercapnia impairs innate immunity by altering expression of host defense genes and impairing phagocytosis. Phagocytosis have been shown to engage autophagy, a conserved pathway that sequesters cytoplasmic material and pathogens into a utophagosomes to be delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Autophagy is induced by several cell stress signals and orchestrated by autophagy -related (ATG) proteins including LC3. In the current study, we explored the effect of hypercapnia on LPS , E. coli 2 36 mmHg) or hypercapnia CO 2, PCO2 108 autophagy marker. Autophagic flux was evaluated by monitoring LC3II by Western Blot and immunofluorescence (IF) in macrophages expose d to LPS , E.coli , or S.aureus in the presence or the absence of bafilomycin A, that blocks the fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, preventing LC3II degradation. LC3 II puncta formation was used to confirm the effect of hypercapnia LPS, E.coli in normocapnia avidly development of extensive LC3II -positive aut ophagic puncta. This effect was markedly reduced in THP -1 cells cultured in 15% CO 2, indicating inhibition of phagocytosis and autophagy by hypercapnia. Compared to culture in 5% CO 2, hypercapnia also decreased LPS or bioparticles -induced LC3II accumulatio n with and without bafilomycin A, that hypercapnia blocks autophagic flux upstream of autophagosome -lysosome fusion. Interestingly, evaluation of LC3II puncta formation showed that hypercapnia not only reduced autophagosome formation on LPS or b ioparticles treated cells by also in the starved ones, suggesting that reduced levels of CO 2 reduces autophagy independently of the initial trigger. Conclusions: Autophagy role on pathogens clearance suggest that reduced autophagy induced by hypercapnia i s involved, at least in part, in impaired phagocytosis that leads to defective pathogen clearance and may therefore contribute to increased infections and poor clinical outcomes in patients with hypercapnia and advanced lung disease.

Mnk activity in medulloblastoma cells. Using both an siRNA-based approach and Mnk1/2 knockout MEFs we determine that Mnk2 but not Mnk1 is required for rapamycin to induce eIF4E phosphorylation. Simultaneous treatment of Mnk inhibitor CGP 57380 reduced medulloblastoma cell proliferation and t he ability to form colonies in soft agar, raising the potential of combinations of mTOR and Mnk inhibitors for the treatment of medulloblastoma. Conclusions: Rapamycin and its analogs induce phosporylation of the eIF4E in medulloblastoma. This phosphorylation is mediated by Mnk2. Concomitant treatment of tumor cells with rapamycin and Mnk inhibitors reduce cell proliferation and transformation as they inhibit anchorage independent cell growth. Taken together, our data indicate a molecular cross-talk between the mTOR and Mnk2-eIF4E pathways in medulloblastoma that has potential to be exploited therapeutically. Presenting Author: Austin E.

Recent evidence shows that functional blockade of Notch1 and its ligand, Dll -4, leads to postnatal lymphatic defects in mice. However, the precise role of the Notch signaling pathway in lymphatic vessel development has yet to be defined. Here we show the developmental role of Notch1 in lymphatic vascu lar morphogenesis by analyzing lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) conditional Notch1 an inducible Prox1CreERT2 driver. Results: LEC-specific Notch1 mutant The phenotype of lym phatic overgrowth accords with increased LEC sprouting from the lymph sacs and increased filopodia formation. Furthermore, cell death was significantly reduced in Notch1 - mutant LECs, whereas proliferation was increased. Conclusions: The lymphatic phenotyp e of LEC -specific conditional Notch1 mouse mutants indicates that Notch activity in LECs controls lymphatic sprouting and growth during development. These results provide evidence that similar to postnatal and pathological lymphatic vessel formation, the N otch signaling pathway plays a role in inhibiting developmental lymphangiogenesis.

Currently there are no available treatments to stop fibrosis progression. Adiponectin is a pleiotropic adipokine with antifibrotic actions. Adiponectin function has been shown to be impaired in SSc patients. A non -peptide small mole cule agonist of adiponectin receptor 1 and adiponectin receptor 2 would potentially be therapeutically important.

Summary: Painful Diabetic Neuropathy (PDN) is a debilitating affliction present in 26% of diabetic patients with substantial impact on their quality of life. Despite this sig nificant prevalence and impact, current therapies for PDN are only partially effective. Moreover, the electrophysiological mechanisms underlying PDN are not well understood. Therefore, given the magnitude of PDN and the absence of effective therapies, the research object of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular and electrophysiological mechanisms responsible for PDN as a critical step towards more effective therapies. Neuropathic pain is caused by sustained excitability in sensory neurons which reduc es the pain threshold, so that pain is produced in the absence of appropriate stimuli. Sensory neurons display sustained and enhanced excitability in response to different molecules including chemokines. Among other functions, chemokine signaling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in animal models. In particular, stromal -derived -factor -1 (SDF - 1) and its receptor CXCR4 are implicated in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain in several animal models. However, the role of CXCR4/SDF -1 signaling in PDN is unknown. Objective: to investigate how CXCR4/SDF -1 signaling modulates calcium influx and action potential thresholds in DRG sensory neurons subtypes in PDN. Methods: We take advantage of an integrate d approach combining pain behavioral tests, electrophysiology studies including current clamp recordings, in v itro and in vivo calcium imaging studies , confocal studies with conditional and transgenic mouse genetic and chemo -genetic silencing of sensory neuron subtypes using mutated hM4D receptor (DREADD) receptors. Results: We demonstrated that CXCR4/SDF -1 signaling is necessary for the induction of PDN in animal models of type II diabetes. Indeed, t he specific CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100, reverses PDN in animal models of type -II diabetes. Foll owing these observations we wanted to investigate the consequences of CXCR4/SDF -1 signaling on diabetic DRG neurons excitability . Hence we demonstrated that application of SDF -1 also increased intracellular calcium concentration, (Ca)I, more frequently in acutely isolated DRG neurons in HFD mice compared to responses from RD mice. Furthermore, electrophysiological current clamp studies on Nav 1.8 cre/tomato HFD induced -diabetic DRG culture demonstrated that application of SDF -1 (20nM) not only depolarized D RG neurons (RMP; -33.2\u00b10.84 mV n=3) but also increased firing frequencies i n response to current injection . Finally, w e observed numerous CXCR4 expressing inflammatory cells infiltrating the DRG of diabetic mice. Characterization of the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate revealed the presence of CD3 positive T -cells, CD68 and F4/80 positive macrophages in HFD -induced diabetic DRG. We are now investigating the communication between Nav 1.8 nociceptive neurons hyper -excitability and inflammation using soph isticated chemo -genetic silencing of DRG neuron subtypes. Mutated hM4D receptor (DREADD) receptors can be selectively activated by the drug clozapine -N-oxide (CNO) allowing the subpopulation of neurons in which it is expressed to be specifically silenced d uring the time the drug is on board. Conclusion : These observations establish chemokine signaling as a new candidate responsible for hyper -excitability in a distinct subpopulation of DRG neurons and inflammation underlying PDN, and will open up a complete ly new field of molecular investigation in this disease entity . Additionally, these experiments will add to our understanding of how changes in the excitability of sensory neurons contribute to the progression of small fiber neuropathy in PDN, which is a c ritical barrier to progression for effective treatment of this currently intractable and widespread affliction.

Summary: EphA members of the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases and promote keratinocyte differentiation when engaged by ephrin -A ligands on adjacent cells. The specific receptor subtype and signaling complexes elicited by these promiscuous membrane receptor -ligand interactions remain unclear. EphA2 is a good candidate for mediating these differentiation responses to ephrins as it undergoes contact -dependent activation in epidermal keratinocytes and exhibits altered expression patterns in psoriasis and skin cancers where differentiation is impaired. Objective : This study was designed to : (1) determine if EphA2 is mandatory for contact - dependent differentiation in primary human epidermal keratinocytes and (2) identify signaling molecules associated with EphA2 after calcium (Ca++)-induced stabiliza tion keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskin obtained through the Skin and Tissue Engineering Core of the Skin Disease Research Center at Northwestern University. To promote differentiation, primary ker atinocytes were switched to 1.2 mM Ca++. EphA2 silencing and gene delivery was mediated using lenti viral and retroviral constructs . Results : To determine its requirement for differentiation, suprabasal epidermal proteins were . Knockdown of EphA2 resulted in impaired differentiation apparent by significantly compromised levels of keratin 10, desmocollin 1 a/b, desmoglein 1, loricrin, and occludin . This differentiation defect was reversed by restoring EphA2 expression using a silencing -resistant murine variant of this receptor. However, an EphA2 truncation mutant lacking the entire cytoplasmic domain of the receptor failed to rescue differentiation indicating the necessity of the intracellu lar tail of EphA2 and associated signaling in EphA2 -driven differentiation . Further, the deficiency in differentiation was not rescued by ectopic expression of EphA1 suggesting nonredundancy in signaling between these highly related receptor tyrosine kinas es. To identify effector proteins of EphA2 that relay downstream signaling via the cytoplasmic domain during differentiation, co -immunoprecipitation of the native receptor was performed in primary keratinocytes . EphA2 associated with Akt prior to its activ ation and this interaction was lost upon stabilization of cell -cell contacts. Following contact -dependent activation, EphA2 cyclically recruited SHIP2; this lipid phosphatase negatively regulates PI3K -Akt signaling and promotes surface stabilization of Eph A2. Conclusions: These findings illustrate the dynamic signaling events associated with EphA2, a receptor that executes a requisite response to cell -cell contact that drives proper epidermal keratinocyte differentiation. Identifying signal transduction mechanisms regulating skin cell differentiation will allow us to identify and therapeutically intervene in pathway deviations contributing to skin diseases such as psoriasis and cancer .

Behavioral studies in rodents have suggested that ongoing hippocampal neurogenesis may play a key role in cognition. Further, impairments in adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been linked to multiple disease states, including Alzheimer's disease and depression. Diverse signaling molecules present in the SGZ regulate multiple aspects of the neurogenic process, including neural stem cell (NSC) mainten ance, proliferation, and differentiation. In particular, inhibition of BMP signaling has been shown to promote hippocampal neurogenesis and improve cognition. However, relatively little is known about how different signaling pathways may interact to regula te NSC behavior. Recent data suggests that BMP signaling may be modified by interaction w ith 1 -integrin, an extracellular matrix -interacting protein that has been implicated in maintenance of NSCs. Objective: To examine the role of 1 -integrin in regulating BMP signaling and determine how this interaction modulates neural stem cell behavior in the adult dentate gyrus. Sample: Neurospheres derived from postnatal day 1 1-integrinflox/flox mice. Whole hippocampi microdissected from 8 week old wild type (C57Bl6) mice. Methods: Neural stem cells were cultured from postnatal day 1 1-integrinflox/flox mice, passaged three times, and exposed adeno -Cre to ablate 1 -integrin or adeno -GFP for the control condition. The level of downstream BMP signaling was assessed by collecting whole cell lysates and immunoblotting for phospho -Smad1,5, and 8. The effect of 1 -integrin ablation on BMP receptor localization was assessed by immunoblotting for BMPR1a and BMPR1b in whole cell lysates and lipid raft fractions. Co -immunoprecipitations were performed on both adult wild type hippocampal tissue an d postnatal day 1 neurosphere lysates to investigate the interaction between 1 -integrin and the BMP receptor subunits. Results: 1-integrin physically interacts with the type I BMP receptors in both the wild type adult hippocampus and in cultured neural stem cells. Genetic a blation of 1 -integrin in neural stem cells leads to an increase in overall levels of BMP signaling and a selective partitioning of the BMPR1b receptor into lipid rafts . Conclusions: 1-integrin modulates BMP signaling in neural stem cells in vitro and regulates the partitioning of BMP receptors into lipid rafts. Future studies will be directed towards examining the interaction between 1-integrin and the BMP signaling pathway in the adult dentate gyrus and elucidating the role of 1 -integrin in regulating neural stem cell proliferation and , or Basic [Basic -donor HLA -antigen B cells in transplant recipients peripheral blood using single HLA coated -beads: A Novel Approach. Summary Recent studies of donor specific HLA allo -antibodies following kidney transpl antation showed a high rate of graft failure in recipients who developed allo -antibodies compared with antibody -free patients. Whether antibodies act alone in graft injury or are mainly the result (and a marker) of an ongoing T and B cells immune response is however still yet to be established. The role of anti-donor HLA B cells which are crucial effectors for generation of donor specific antibodies in transplant recipients, a situation associated with chronic rejection, is still unknown. Moreover, several reports suggested that the presence of B cells in rejecting grafts is a hallmark of severe lesions. In addition, pre -graft high frequency of donor antigen HLA specific B cell has been shown to be associated with rejection, while no HLA specific antibodies were yet detected. Quantifying the frequency of anti -donor HLA antigen specific B cells (whether donor specific or not) might be of importance for better understanding of the mechanisms of graft lesions, for an earlier diagnostic of chronic rejection, and eventually to guide specific B cell -targeted therapy. In addition a method would be needed to allow isolating antigen -specific B cells for more precisely study their phenotype, transcriptional pattern, and function in various pathologies that affect the graft. Objective To quantify and characterize anti -HLA antigen -committed B cells incubated using HLA -coated beads. Sample Sensitized k idney transplant recipients peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an example of application. Methods Bead -B-lymphocyte Ros ette (BBR) frequency was enumerated and anti-HLA B cell specificity characterized by flow cytometry. Results The method could detect significantly higher anti -HLA BBR frequency in sensitized patients following transplantation, compared to non -sensitized s table patients, and healthy volunteers. Usage of multiplexed beads also shows a significant increase in specific anti -donor HLA antigen BBR in immunized recipients. The advantages of the wide variety of available HLA antigens in single test using multiplex ed beads enabled studying B cell receptor poly and cross -reactivity. Conclusions This new approach provides access to information and biological material enabling a better understanding of the role of B lymphocytes during the immune response before and af ter mismatched organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation.

Longnecker Department: Pediatrics Clinical, or Basic Science, or Public Health and Social Sciences: Basic Science Email: d-wilcox@fsm.northwestern.edu Title: A Infection simplex virus (HSV) in adults is often subclinical, but in the newborn HSV is a significant cause of mortality and morbidity. Although differences in the immune response between the developing brain and the adult have been implicated in the increased severity of disease in the neonate, the precise reasons for this difference are unknown. HSV-1 binds and inhibits the autophagic activating protein beclin-1 to increase pathogenesis in the adult mouse brain. Autophagy is an important process in the developing brain, and the interaction of HSV with autophagy may influence pathogenesis in this exceptionally susceptible population. In particular, regulation of autophagy is critical for maintaining a proper balance between proliferation and apoptosis in the developing brain, providing for an autophagic environment that is distinct from the adult. Objective: We hypothesized that the disruption of autophagy by HSV in the newborn brain would contribute to enhanced neurologic disease in newborns as compared with adult mice. Results: We used intracranial inoculation of mice as a model of HSV encephalitis. Newborn and adult mice were inoculated with viruses lacking the HSV neurovirulence gene ICP34.5 (HSV-1/34.5) the beclin 1-binding ICP34.5 (HSV-1/dBBD), along with their revertants. HSV lacking the ICP34.5 gene was attenuated for mortality in both newborn mice and in adult mice after intracranial inoculation. In contrast, deletion of the beclin-1 binding domain of the ICP34.5 gene led to significantly attenuated pathogenesis in adult mice but not in newborn mice. Infected regions of the brain in adult mice did not demonstrate evidence of autophagy by immunohistochemical staining, but comparable sections from brains of newborn mice were abundantly positive for the LC3 and p62 markers, suggesting that autophagy is not inhibited by HSV infection in the newborn brain. Furthermore, the corresponding regions of newborn brains had evidence of increased apoptotic cell death compared to adult mice. We additionally found evidence of activated autophagy and apoptosis in a sample obtained at autopsy from a human case of neonatal HSV encephalitis, supporting the clinical significance of our observations in the murine model. Conclusions: We conclude from our data that unlike in the adult, HSV inhibition of beclin-1 is dispensable for pathogenesis in the newborn brain. HSV infection does not suppress the autophagic response in the infected newborn brain, and this ongoing autophagy is associated with increased apoptosis. Dysregulation of autophagy in the newborn may contribute to the increased susceptibility of this population to CNS disease caused by HSV, and is a therapeutic target that has the potential to significantly alter the course of disease.

The epidermal barrier is composed of two major struc tures: 1) tight junctions in the granular layer and 2) the overlying stratum corneum made up of anucleate corneocytes encased in a highly crosslinked cornified envelope and surrounded by a specialized lipid matrix. Since both of these barriers are often c ompromised in inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, strategies to restore epidermal barrier characteristics in the face of inflammation are needed. In light of our recent studies identifying the Eph/ephrin s ignaling pathway as a positive regulator of keratinocyte differentiation we reasoned that approaches targeting these receptor tyrosine kinases may prove useful for enhancing tight junctions and the stratum corneum in human skin. Objective: The goal of this study was to d etermine whether and Eph/ephrin signaling pathway could enhance epidermal tight junction and barrier characteristics. Methods: A combination of 2D and 3D human skin culture models were used to study tight junction protein expression, assembly, and func tion as well as stratum corneum biochemistry and ultrastructure following delivery of recombinant ephrinA -Fc fusion protei ns to target the EphA2 receptor. EGF (10 ng/uL) and IL -1 (10 ng/uL) treatment was used to model aspects of the wound healing and inflammation microenvironment that perturb the epidermal barrier . Results: Primary the ephrinA -Fc ligand mimetic, which not only restricted clonal growth capacity and triggered differentiation but also increased the expression levels and membrane association of tight junction components (Claudin -1, Claudin confluent epidermal sheets was increased by ephrin treatment indicative of enhanced tight junction function. Moreover, in keratinocytes pre-treated with a combination of EGF and IL - 1, ephrin delivery restored tight junction protein expression and function. A 3-D organotypic model of human epidermis was also exposed to these pro -inflammatory cytokines and wound - associated growth factors; this disrupted tight junctions and led to the f ormation of abnormally thick stratum corneum with incomplete collapse of the keratin filament matrix. In addition , cytokine treatment resulted in an abnormal increase in transglutaminase crosslinking activity and transcript levels of genes that encode for proteins that are targeted by this enzyme in the stratum corneum (SPRRs, PAI2, PI -3, and Involucrin) . Importantly, e phrin A delivery was capable of normalizing these epidermal defects in the 3 -D human skin culture model of inflammation. Conclusions: Our findings reveal Eph/ephrins as positive regulators of epidermal tight junctions. Ephrins may prove useful for dampening inflammatory responses and restoring homeostasis by normalizing barrier function that is compromised during wound healing and in skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis.

The role of de novo donor -specific HLA antibodies (DSA) in liver transplantation remains unknown as most of the previous studies have only focused on preformed HLA antibodies. Objective: The role of donor -specific antibodies (DSAs) has been well documented in heart and kidney transplants but with less clarity in liver transplantation (LT). This study characterizes DSA responses following LT in rats. Methods: Livers from AC I rats were transplanted orthotopically into Lewis r ats. The recipients were untreated or treated with daily calcineurin inhibitor FK506 (1mg/kg,i.p) for 8 weeks or until the endpoint of the study (five months). Serial blood samples were collected at post -operative day (POD) 7, 90, and 150 for evaluations o f plasma DSA production and liver graft function. Histological examination was performed on POD150. Results: All isografts (n=5) survived beyond POD150 with normal liver function and histology, whereas all untreated liver allografts (n=6) had abnormal liv er graft function (increased AST, ALT, and TB and decreased albumin) in 7 days and succumbed to graft failure in 20 days with severe acute allograft rejection. Interesting DSA analysis revealed that DSAs including IgM, total IgG and subtypes IgG1, IgG2a, I gG2b were significantly increased as early as POD7, compared to the na\u00efve rats and isografts, suggesting that liver allografts trigger early, robust DSA response. Treatment with FK506 significantly inhibited DSA production at POD 7 and significantly prolon ged liver graft survival as 14 out of 20 liver transplants survived 150 days post-transplant (p<0.01 vs. untreated) regardless of FK506 withdrawn at 8 weeks. However, results from the liver functional analyses revealed that liver graft function and tissue integrity were progressively compromised despite of continuous FK506 at POD90 and POD150. The extent of the chronic graft injury and functional alteration was more profound in the liver allografts subjected to FK506 withdrawal at 8 weeks. C orrespondingly, a significant increase in donor specific IgG1 and IgG2b was detected at POD 90 (both p < .01, vs. isografts), and the increase in IgG2b was further strengthened at POD 150 in the allografts with no difference between the continued use of FK506 and FK506 w ithdrawal. Conclusions: De novo DSAs are associated with both acute and chronic liver allograft rejection. FK506 effectively inhibited early DSA production, but is not sufficient for prevention of de novo donor specific DSA. C onsidering that IgG2b is a m ost potent activator for both complement and Fc receptor activation in rats, IgG2b may be an important therapeutic target for chronic liver allograft rejection.

Upon the identification of novel ALS/FTD- associated gene mutations in UBQLN2, we investigated the developmental role of the gene in order to better understand the early cellular organization and/or processes implicated in progression of the disease state. We present here a requirement for wild-type UBQLN in spinal cord development by not only motor neurons, but the oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) pool from which they arise. Moreover, we identify deficits in mutant transfected cells with implications for autophagy in promoting ALS pathology. Objective: We sought to characterize the developmental function of UBQLN2, a novel ALS/FTD-associated gene, in spinal motor neurons and their progenitors in order to shed light on the early events underlying the motor neuron dysfunction characteristic of ALS. Methods: We employed both loss- and gain-of-function approaches in the danio rerio vertebrate model system. Endogenous Ubqln expression was knocked down via translation blocking oligonucleotide injection, and human UBQLN2 wild-type and mutant mRNA were introduced similarly. Embryos and larvae were processed for OPC and motor neuron visualization via confocal microscopy. To assess the consequences of mutation in motor neuron dysfunction, cell culture and immunohistological techniques were employed. Results: Knockdown of endogenous zebrafish Ubqln resulted in the truncation of motor neuron axons, as well as highly elaborate interstitial branching. In some instances, knockdown resulted in axonal disorganization, indicative of pathfinding errors. Moreover, defects in progenitor pattering in the spinal cord were observed, suggesting a number of not mutually exclusive possibilities: increased OPC division, decreased maturation and fate commitment, inefficient apoptosis, and defective migration. Interestingly, overexpression of ALS-associated mutant UBQLN2 transcripts resulted in some similar defects as those observed in the endogenous knockdown (motor neuron truncation, excessive axonal branching, and appreciable OPC accumulation in the spinal cord with an apparent decrease in the number of migrating OPCs); however, expression of the wild-type transcript largely phenocopied the uninjected control, presenting a potential increase in OPC migration. In cells transfected with UBQLN mutant constructs, autophagosome accumulation, resulting in autophagy deficits, as well as defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion were observed. Conclusions: The present findings demonstrate a requirement for UBQLN2 in normal spinal cord development. ALS pathology, as demonstrated by both gain- and loss-of-function ALS- associated transcript manipulation in danio rerio, has a development origin beginning with the progenitor pool. That the ALS-associated UBQLN2 mutation was correlated with autophagosome accumulation, resulting in autophagy deficits, as well as defects in autophagosome-lysosome fusion may be suggestive of a role for autophagy in promoting the motor neuron and OPC phenotypes observed in vivo, thus contributing to ALS presentation.

Conditional deletion of the two v ascular growth factors Angiopoietin- 1 and Angiopoietin- 2 results in loss of Schlemm 's canal and the lymphatic capillaries of the ocular limbus . Our data demonstrate a previously unrecognized essential role of lymphatics in the eye to maintain normal intraocular pres sures. Objectives: The Angiopoietin- Tie2/Tek signaling system is a major regulator of vascular development. Unlike the obligate agonistic role of Angpt1, Angpt2 is reported to have both antagonist and agonist roles. In contrast to the well -established rol es of this pathway in fetal life, almost nothing is known about its role in mature tissues. Importantly, this pathway is under intense clinical investigation to treat a variety of vascular diseases, underscoring the need to understand its biologic function(s). To elucidate the individual roles of Angpt1 and Angpt2 in different tissues and to determine the role of this pathway in adult health and disease, we generated double knockout mice, which have allowed us to better understand inter -ligand compensation and the role of Angpt2 in blood and lymphatic vascular regulation. Methods : The reverse- tetracycline- transactivator system driven by the expressed ROSA26 locus was used to obtain timed, whole- body deletion of the Angpt1 and Angpt2 genes in A1A2Flox WB mice. Pregnant dams were induced with doxycycline at embryonic day 16.5 to obtain knockout mice for analysis. Results: While A1A2Flox WBE16.5 mice appear normal in early postnatal life, the eyes of mutant animals begin to protrude strikingly in both males and females 21- 28 days after birth. Exophthalmos worsens with age, and by 8 weeks mice have difficulty closing their eyes . Gross exam ination of dissected eyes revealed that the increase in size is due to swelling of the anterior chamber, caused by accumulation of aqueous humor and increased intraocular pressure. Sagittal sections reveal characteristic features of glaucoma, including retinal degradation and cupping of the optic nerve head. Despite the dramatic increase in IOP, Iridocorneal angles remain open in all A1A2Flox WBE16.5 eyes examined, establishing A1A2FloxWB mice as a new model of pressure -induced open- angle glaucoma. As increases in IOP are often due to defects in anterior chamber drainage , we looked for defects in development of Schlemm's canal or the vasculature of the ocular limbus. Histology of the Iridocorneal angle region revealed that Schlemm's canal is absent in the eyes of A1A2FloxWBE16.5 mice. In addition, v essels were examined by confocal microscopy of flat - mounted eyes, which revealed a complete loss of LYVE- 1 positive lymphatic endothelium in the ocular limbus. Conclusions: Glaucoma is the leading cause of blindness worldwide, yet few animal models which accurately recapitulate human disease are available. A1A2Flox WB mice provide a reproducible, rapid onset model of high -pressure glaucoma, providing an important new tool to aid in the understanding of eye disease. In addition, these studies have identified a novel and unexpected role for lymphatic drainage and the Angiopoietin- Tek signaling pathway in regulating ocular drainage and intraocular pressure\u2014suggesting new pathways and molecular targets for treatment of glaucoma.

Podocyte func tion is tightly linked to the unique and complex organization of its cytoskeleton and the ability to adhere to the glomerular basement membrane. Human genetic diseases and mouse models in which disruption of genes encoding components of the actin -based cyt oskeleton, cytoskeletal regulatory factors or extracellular matrix interacting proteins result in proteinuria and glomerular injury. Despite i ntensive research in this area, many cases of glomerular disease with podocyte foot -process effacement are classif ied as 'idiopathic.' Objective : Identify novel gene products that regulate podocyte function in vivo using a pooled in vitro that podocyte adhesion and morphology can be u sed as an in vitro correlate of podocyte function in vivo. We therefore designed a novel genome -wide screen for factors involved in podocyte adhesion to both fibronectin, a classic integrin mediated adhesion pathway, and sFLT1/Fc, a novel heparin sensitive adhesion pathway using a pooled 90 000 shRNA hairpin library . A pool of shRNA knock -down podocytes was generated using this library and plated on both substrates for one hour followed by separation of the adherent and non - adherent fractions and deconvolut ion of the hairpins present in each fraction by illumina sequencing. Given that this is the first screen for adhesion in any cell type , we developed a highly stringent method for statistical an alysis and 'hit' determination. Furthermore, prior to a larger scale hit -validation using a secondary screen, we performed a well -by-well small -scale validation of four top candidate genes - DPH1, DPH2, DPH3 and DPH4 podocyte to fibronectin and 237 hairpin s that increased adhesion to sFLT1/Fc. In addition, we identified 183 hairpins that decreased podocyte adhesion to fibronectin and 243 and were in the top ten hit s by z-score for increased adhesion to both fibronectin and sFLT1/Fc . Stable cell lines for these hairpins showed at least a 50% knock -down of gene expression by qPCR and a statistically significant increases in adhesion to both fibronectin and sFLT1/Fc. Furthermore, stable overexpression of DPH2 in human podocytes resulted in decreased adhesion to both substrates whereas overexpression of DPH3 resulted in increased adhesion to both substrates. Conclusion: We have developed and performed a small -scale validation of a novel method for identifying putative genes involved in regulat ing the podocyte cytoskeleton. Future work will include a larger -scale validation of all hits using a focused secondary screen, and a detailed study of select candidates in a hypoth esis directed fashion. This unbiased approach will yield a list of genes that will broaden our understanding not only of podocyte physiology, but also of the disease states that perturb this system and resul t in chronic kidney disease and renal failure .

Although progress has been made in our understanding of these important processes, how they are regulated is poorly appreciated. The miRs -103/107 family is preferentially expressed in the stem cell -enriched limbal epithelium. We to limbal keratinocytes. Methods: he effects of miRs -103/107 on HLEK proliferation using a combination of submerged and 3 -dimensional (3 -D) raft cultures in conjunction with the kinetics of BrdU incorporation, WST -1 cell proliferation assay, analysis (FACS), and epithelial proge nitor competition assays. To validate potential targets of miRs -103/107 that regulate the cell cycle, we used in silico and cell -based luciferase reporter assays. Gain - and loss -of- function experiments with miRs -103/107 in HLEKs confirmed the targets. The se investigations were complemented by siRNA studies against the targets to assess biological function. Results: Following transduction of miRs -103/107, fewer cells (4 x 104) were observed compared with the empty vector transduced keratinocytes (5 x 105). The proliferative status of the transduced keratinocytes was also altered as evidenced by a 20% reduc tion in cells in the S phase (*p >0.05) and a >50% increase in the population doubli ng time (3 days vs. 6.6 days, *p>0.01). FACS analysis of the cell cycle kinetics of a human limbal -derived corneal cell line (hTCEpi) transduced with miR -103 or miR -107 revealed an arrest in the G1 phase without an increase in apoptosis. To place the cell kinetic data into a more physiologically relevant context, we utilized 3-D organotypic raft cultures, which mimic stratified squamous epithelia. Most basal cells in 3 -D raft cultures formed during a progenitor competition assay were miRs apacity. Holoclone assays, which are an accepted means of assessing proliferative capacity, confirmed this. miRs -103/107 transduction gave rise to significantly more holoclones (colonies >0.1cm2) than the scrambled control. Luciferase and Western blot data indicated that HOXD13 and p90RSK2, two positive regulators of the G1/S transition, are direct targets of miRs -103/107. Silencing HOXD13 reduced (30%) keratinocyte proliferation. Treatment of keratinocytes with a specific inhibitor of p90RSK resulted in a 65% reduction in proliferation. Likewise, silencing p90RSK reduced BrdU incorporation (25%) and increased the population doubling time by 15%. Conclusions: We propose that miRs -103/107 contribute to the epithelial stem cell phenotype by attenuating HOXD13 and p90RSK, which confers quiescence. One of the major challenges of ex vivo corneal epithelial cell therapy is expansion and preservation of \"stemness\" from a small biopsy. miRs -103/107 may represent a novel means of meeting this challenge.

They become sympto matic in 30% of all women and up to 70% of African American women of reproductive age. Epigenetic dysregulation of DNA methylation (5 -mC) has been demonstrated at the genome -wide level in leiomyoma tissues; however, the role of the newly identified epigene tic mark DNA hydroxymethylation (5 -hmC) and its regulators the, ten - eleven translocation (TET) proteins have yet to be fully elucidated. In this study we used human uterine leiomyoma and normal myometrial tissues to characterize the role of 5 -hmC and TET proteins in leiomyoma. We demonstrated higher 5 -hmC levels in leiomyoma tissues compared to normal myometrial tissues. Additionally, we observed that the increase in 5 -hmC levels is due to the upregulation of TET1 and TET3 mRNA and subsequent protein expres sion in leiomyoma tissues. Functionally, we demonstrated that independent silencing of TET1 and TET3 by siRNA significantly reduced 5 -hmC levels in leiomyoma. Interestingly, the silencing of TET1 and TET3 resulted in a significant decrease in cell prolifer ation. Finally, treatment with the oncometabolite 2-HG, a competitive inhibitor of TET proteins, resulted in a significant decreased in 5 -hmC levels, and it also lead to a substantial decrease in cell proliferation in leiomyoma. This study presents the fir st evidence for an epigenetic imbalance of the 5 -hmC homeostasis in uterine leiomyoma due to the increase of 5 -hmC through the upregulation of theTET1 and TET3 proteins. Our data suggest a possible functional role of 5 -hmC in the pathogenesis of this disea se, and the identification of 5 -hmC and its regulators could be potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in uterine leiomyoma.

It has been also used as a \"permissive hypercapnia\" strategy to treat patients on mechanical ventilation. However, the effect of high CO 2 levels on the airways and lungs is controversial. Previous reports suggest that high CO 2 levels modify gen e expression in various cell types and species and we recently observed that hypercapnia affected the expression of genes related to airway muscle contraction in mouse lungs by microarray. The present study was designed to explore the effect of hypercapni a on mouse airway smooth muscle (ASM) contraction. Methods : Adult male C57BL/6 mice were maintained for up to 21 days in control (room air) or high CO 2 (10% CO 2 and 21% O 2) conditions. The lungs were excised at day 3, 7, 14 and 21 and stained for histo logical analysis with hematoxilin -eosin and immunohistochemical analysis with alpha -smooth muscle actin (a -SMA) antibody. For in vitro experiments, ASM cells were isolated from the trachea from mice in control conditions and cultured under normocapnic (pC O2 of 40 mmHg and pO 2 of 160 mmHg) and hypercapnic (pCO 2 of 120mmHg and pO 2 of 160 mmHg) conditions. The buffering capacity of the culture medium was modified by changing its initial pH with Tris -MOPS base in order to obtain a pH of 7.4 at the various CO 2 levels. Expressions of contractile protein were examined by qPCR and Western blot and acethylcholine -induced contraction was studied by time -lapse microscopy in the cultured cells. Results : In histological analyses, we found that the luminal area of bro nchioles in the mice exposed to hypercapnia for up to 21 days was significantly smaller than those in the control mice and decreased in an exposure -time dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed an increased expression of a -SMA in bronchioles from the mi ce exposed to hypercapnia. The expression of myosin II in the ASM cells cultured under hypercapnic conditions was increased both at transcriptional and at translational levels. In addition, acethylcholine -induced contraction in the ASM cells cultured und er hypercapnic conditions was higher than those under normocapnic conditions. Conclusions : These results suggest that hypercapnia induces airway smooth muscle contraction independently of hypoxia and pH. This information provides new insights into the mechanism of hypercapnic respiratory distress and permissive hypercapnia.

One hallmark of cancer is to avoid growth suppression from the immune system . Among many different mechanisms, one method by which GBMs subvert the immune system is to transform immune cells , particularly microglia and macrophages (MM) , into an alternatively active phenotypic state . Alternatively activated MMs do little to protect the central nervous system, and instead, decrease T-cell response to glioma, and by releasing various cytokines are believed to aid glioma invasion rather than inhibit ing it. Studies indicate up to as much as 30% of GBM mass is compo sed of MMs , and their increased prevalence in GBM is known to correlate with a worse prognosis. Objective: To examine the behavior of MMs amongst glioma cells in order to understand how their behavior may influenc e glioma inva sion. Methods: Data was pr ovided from an in vivo rat model of a platlet derived growth factor (PDGF) induced glioblastoma. Rats were sacked 12 days after injecting PDGF retrovirus. T ime-lapse microscopy of sliced brain tissue was used to record moves for a span of 7 to 18 hours of fluorescently labeled MM (dsRed) interacting with glioma cells (GFP). A subset of MM and glioma cells were individually tracked each frame throughout the duration of the movie . Tracking data was used in order to fit mathematical models to describe movem ent behavior. In addition, movies were processed, and analyzed using pa rticle image velocimetry (PIV) in order to generate a velocity flow field based upon the moving fluorescent cells over time. Results: MMs exhibit increased speed, and low direction al persistence in the presence of glioma cells. Outside the tumor, MMs exhibit very little mo vement. Sparse glioma cells found wit hin regions of immotile MMs exhibit little migration. In contrast, motile and persistent glioma cells are concentrated in regi ons of motile microglia. A subset of a distinct small, amoeboid -like morphology , are found only within the glioma and are characterized by fast speeds (greater than 30 m/hr). Efforts to mathematically characterize the movement behavi or of MM indicate that they are not well described by either Brownian motion, or L evy flight. In contrast, a persistent random walk model can be used to characterize glioma cells when in the presence of motile MMs . Conclusions: MMs demonstrate a complex, a nd dynamic range of behavior depend ing upon their proximity to glioma cells . Similarly, g lioma cell motility appears to be dynamic depending on the surrounding microglia and macrophage s. These results show the effects of the abundant, and under characte rized cytokines that are channeled between alternatively activated immune cells and glioma. In addition, quantifying the properties of MMs in their alternatively activated state may lead to identification of their phenotypic state within other disease cont exts.

Every year, over a million children younger than five years old wil l develop severe, life threatening pneumonia in response to IAV infection. IAV infection triggers the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, a protein complex that regulates the caspase -1 dependent release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL -18, w hich in turn promote leukocyte infiltration in the lung. While this response aids in clearance of the virus, excessive immune response can lead to hypercytokinemia which can cause ext ensive tissue damage and death. As such, investigating inflammasome regul ation is important in understanding the immune response to juvenile influenza. Vimentin, a type III intermediate filament, has previously been implicated in immune function . Objective: We sought to determine whether vimentin is required for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in a mouse model juvenile IAV old or saline. Inflammatory cytokines from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL F) were analyzed by ELISA five days post infection. Histological evidence of inflammation was assessed by H&E staining of paraffin -fixed lungs. Viral titers were determined by plaque assay from lung homogenates. Changes in lung cell population were determi ned by FACS analysis of CD45+ cells obtained from lung homogenates. Results: Wild-type (WT) and Vim-/- mice were subjected to a lethal dose of IAV, which potently stimulated pro -inflammatory cytokine expression and induced a systemic inflammatory respon se that was associated with significant mortality. WT mice displayed approximately a 3 -fold increase in mortality compared with Vim-/- mice. Histopathological examination showed that the lungs of IAV -treated WT mice had severe alveolar damage, characterize d by interstitial edema and increased fluid and debris in the air space as compared to IAV-treated Vim-/- mice. The loss of vimentin did not appear to interfere with IAV replication/clearance as measured by viral plaque assay. Exposure to IAV is followed b y large increases in immune cells in the airspace. A FACS analysis of whole lung lysates showed no significant differences in the myeloid cell populations between WT and Vim-/- saline treated mice . Vim-/- mice had a larger neutrophil population following IAV infection compared to WT mice. IAV induces rapid production and release of pro -inflammatory cytokines via the NLRP3 inflammasome . BALF following five day IAV infection suggested that Vim-/- mice were protected from the robust activation of the inflam masome, as demonstrated by lower measured levels of IL -1. Conclusion: In our juvenile mouse model of influenza infection, vimentin deficient mice were protected from the effects of the virus, as demonstrated by decreased mortality and lung injury follow ing infection. The data further suggests that vimentin may be involved in the regulation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Presenting Author: Evan Weber , B.S. Position Student Principal Investigator: William Muller, M.D., Ph.D Department: Pathology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Leukocyte transendothelial migration (TEM) is a critical step in the inflammatory cascade and is regulated by a multitude of cellular signals. Leukocyte/endoth elial PECAM homophilic interactions and a transient increase in endothelial cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) are required for TEM. However, the sequence and coordination of these events remains unclear, and the Ca2+ channel(s) mediating the obligatory [Ca2+]i has not yet been identified. Objective: The primary aim s of this study were to investigate the sequential nature of leukocyte/endothelial PECAM homophilic interactions and . PECAM homophilic interactions and endothelial [Ca2+]i were conducted using published endpoint assays in which hundreds of TEM and events were counted and analyzed . HUVEC transduced with adenovirus expressing the receptor operated Ca2+ channel , transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6 ) shRNA or empty/scrambled controls were used to examine the effect s of TRPC6 knockdown on leukocyte adhesion and TEM . To test the requirement of TRPC6 during TEM in vivo , we induced acute inflammation in the ears of chimeric TRPC6 -/- mice and analyzed the effects of endothelial TRPC6 deficiency on leukocyte trafficking, adhesion, and TEM compared to wild type controls. Results: Activation of endothelial TRPC6 with a selective TRPC6 agonist was sufficient to restore TEM of n eutrophil s that were arrested on the apical surface of HUVEC by anti- PECAM Ab , suggesting that TRPC6 is channel mediating [Ca2+]i during TEM. Activation of endothelial TRPC6 prior to addition of the neutrophil/anti -PECAM Ab suspension did not restore TEM , indicating that PECAM homophilic interactions are upstream of TRPC6 -mediated [Ca2+]i during TEM. The importance of TRP C6 during TEM was further evidenced by assays demonstrating attenuation in neutrophil TEM across endothelial monolayers in TRPC6 was knocked down by shRNA . In chimeric mice that were deficient in TRPC6 on the endothelium, but not on leukocytes, we o bserved a pronounced defect in neutrophil TEM at sites of acute inflammation accompanied by normal levels of leukocyte trafficking and adhesion . Conclusions: Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PECAM signaling is upstream of TRPC6 -mediated [Ca2+]i in the pathway that governs leukocyte TEM.

Although the stem cell m arker LGR5, a GPCR protein, has been ident ified as RSPO receptors, the mechanism of the RSPO -LGR5 interaction has remained elusive. Here, we present the crystal structure of RSPO1 in complex with the extracellular domains of LGR5 and the co-receptor RNF43. The unusual architecture of the RSPO1 -LGR5-RNF43 ternary complex provides insights into how the three proteins work together to modulate Wnt signaling. Methods : Using HEK293 S expression system, we overexpress ed RSPO1, LGR5 ectodomain, and RNF43 ectodomain l Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) to homogeneity . The three proteins were successfully co -crystallized . With synchrotron X-ray source at APS we determined the crystal structure of the RSPO1 -LGR5 -RNF43 complex to 2.5 -\u00c5 resolution. Results: In struct ure, RSPO1 is sandwiched by LGR5 and RNF43, confirming previous conjectures that the three proteins form a signaling complex . Complementing our structural data, m utagenesis and Wnt reporter assay s were carried out to identify key interface \"hot spot\" residues. Importantly, s everal genetic mutations map to and highlight the disease relevance of the RSPO1 -RNF43 interface which pro mises therapeutic targeting. Furthermore, s tructural and biochemical data suggest that LGR5 increases the affinity of RSPO1 to R NF43 by ~10 fold, supporting LGR5 as a scaffolding receptor that helps tighten the interaction between RSPO1 and RNF43 . Together, RSPO1, RNF43, and LGR5 work cooperatively via formation of a ternary complex on the cell -surface. Conclusions: In summary, t he mechanistic details governing Wnt signaling regulation is only emerging. The LGR5 -RSPO1 -RNF43 structure represents a step forward in understanding such a complex regulation. The central role of RSPOs in tethering co -receptors strongly suggests that th ese proteins could be further explored as potential modulators for stem cell biology , regenerative medicine , and anti -tumor targets .

Most TE M occurs at endothelial cell borders (paracellular). However, there is indirect evidence to suggest that at the tight junctions of the blood -brain barrier (BBB), leukocytes migrate directly through the endothelial cell body (transcellular). Why leukocytes migrate through the endothelial cell body rather than the cell borders is unclear . TEM in peripheral tissues is dependent on PECAM -1 and CD99 and requires targeted trafficking of membrane from the Lateral Border Recycli ng Compartment (LBRC), a novel interc ellular endothelial compartment. However, their role for TEM across the BBB is unknown . Understanding the route and molecular mechanisms dri ving TEM at the BBB is fundamental to developing better reagents to modulate immune responses in neuroinflammatory d iseases. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the tightness of endothelial cell junctions influences the pathwa y of transendothelial migration . Methods: We generate d human BBB models t o investigate the relationship between the tightness of endothelial cell junctions and the route of TEM in vitro . We simulated the BBB by treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with astrocyte conditioned medium supplemented with agents that raise intracellular cAMP and compar ed th is to the TY10 human BBB endothelial cell line. We characterized monolayer barrier function using transendothelial electrical resistance and measuring permeability 20 kDa FITC Induction for BBB tight junction protein claudin -5. The pathway of monocyte TEM was determined by confocal imaging. The molecular mechanisms governing TEM were examined by blocking PECAM -1 and CD99 function and by performing targeted recycling assays. Results: We devel oped an in vitro model of the BBB that possessed ten -fold higher transendothelial electrical resistance than standard culture conditions and strongly expressed the BBB marker claudin -5. We found that paracellular TEM was still the predominant pathway (98%) and TEM was dependent on the adhesion and signaling molecules PECAM -1 and CD99. We show that endothelial tight junctions expressing claudin -5 are dynamic and undergo rapid remodeling during TEM. PECAM -1 and CD99 bearing m embrane from the LBRC is mobilized to the exact site of tight junction remodeling. This preserves the endothelial barrier by sealing the intercellular gaps with LBRC membrane and engaging the unligated adhesion molecules (PECAM -1 and CD99) it crosses the cell border. Conclusions : Paracellular diapedesis is the primary pathway utilized by monocytes at the BBB in vitro . PECAM -1 and CD99 were required for efficient monocyte TEM . Tight junctions are rapidly rem odeled during paracellular TEM and this was coordinated with targeted trafficking of the LBRC . Rapid remodeling of tight junctions is a tightly regulated process as barrier function was maintained during TEM. These findings provide new insights into leukocyte -endothelial interactions at the BBB and suggest that tight junctions are more dynamic than previously appreciated. Ongoing studies will confirm these findings in vivo using intravital microscopy and creating a cranial window to observe TEM at the BBB in resp onse to acute neuroinflammation.

Pathological inclusions containing U BQLN2 are a common pathological feature in a wide spectrum of ALS and ALS -FTD, including SOD1 -linked ALS. Recent findings have linked abnormalities in UBQLN2 to defects in protein degradation via the ubiquitin -proteasome system (UPS), abnormal protein agg regation and neurodegeneration. UBQLN2 sits at the crossroads of protein degradation through the UPS, and bulk lysosomal degradation via autophagy. Continuous turnover of intracellular components by autophagy is essential to preserve neuronal homeostasis. Alterations in autophagy have been proposed to contribute to pathogenesis in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS. However, the precise mechanism behind autophagy malfunction in ALS is poorly understood. Objective: To explore the pathogenic m echanism of mutant UBQLN2 -mediated ALS and ALS/dementia . Methods: autophagy, neuro -2a cells skin fibroblasts derived from ALS patients were used for some experiments. For flow cytometry , cells were collected 48 hours post -transfection using a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer and analyzed using BD FACSDiva software. For imaging studies, cells were fixed 24 hours post -transfection, immunolabeled and analyzed using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta laser scanning confocal microscope. Western blotting and ELISA were performed according to standard protocols. Results: In this study, using cellular models and cells derived from patients with ALS -FTD, we find that cells expressing mutant UBQLN2 accumulate autophagosomes and autophagosome precursors. Expression of mutant UBQLN2 leads to an accumulation of autophagosome - associated proteins, LC3 and p62. After autophagic induction, autophagosomes in mutant UBQLN2 expressing cells fail to mature into autolysosomes and degrade LC3 and p62. TDP43 accumulates in the after mutant UBQLN2 expression. Overexpression of wild -type UBQLN2 markedly reduces the levels of SOD1 in cells derived from SOD1 -G93A transgenic mice, an effect that is disrupted by mutant UBQLN2. Conclusions: Collectively, these data suggest that impaired autophagy is central to the pathogenesis of UBQLN2 -linked ALS and FTD and may explain the pathology seen in ALS and FTD patients, including abnormal cytosolic accumulation of p62 and TDP43.

DYRK1A has been shown to affect numerous cellular functions by phosphorylating proteins involved in apoptosis, survival, neuronal differentiation and transcriptional regulation. DYRK1A has been well characterized in neurons , with dosage- dependent roles in several neuro cognitive disorders , including Down s yndrome . Recently , our group demonstrated a tumor -promoting role for DYRK1A in Down s yndrome -associated Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (DS-AMKL) , which prompted us to further investigat e its role in normal blood cell development. In a genetic loss -of-function model, we discovered a requirement for DYRK1A in cell cycle regulation during lymphoid development. We propose a model in which DYRK1A mediates cell cycle exit in pre -B and pre -T cells by phosphorylating at least two proteins: LIN52, a known DYRK1A target involved in the assembly of the DREAM (DP, Rb-like, E2F, and MuvB) complex , and Cyclin D3, a novel DYRK1A target with established functio ns in lymphoid cell cycle regulation. Objective: To elucidate the role of DYRK1A in normal lymphopoiesis with regards to cell cycle regulation Methods: We generated a conditional Dyrk1a allele that allows Cre recombinase -inducible inactivation of the g ene, and crossed the resulting mice to Mx1-Cre transgenic mice to study pan-hematopoietic loss of DYRK1A. Thymocytes and bone marrow were isolated for lymphoid development analysis by flow cytometry , colo ny-forming assays, RNA -sequencing, and western blot. Results : We saw that ablation of DYRK1A expression led to a decrease in both CD4+/CD8+ double -positive (DP) thymocytes and pre-B cell populations. This defect lymphoid development was further confirmed by ex vivo colony assays in which pre -B cell colonies were essentially non-existent from the knockout mice . Since these stages of lymphoid development rely on proper cell cycle exit after several rounds of proliferation , we investigat ed the potential role of DYRK1A in cell cycle regulation at these devel opmental stages . Indeed, DYRK1A -deficient pre - B cells and DP thymocytes failed to properly exit the cell cycle despite severely reduced total cell numbers. Using flow-purified quiescent cells from each population RNA -sequencing revealed a global de-repress ion of genes associated with cell cycle progression (i.e. DREAM complex targets) in double -positive thymocytes and pre -B cells . Furthermore , we saw a substantial accumulation of Cyclin D3 protein in these populations in CKO mice, despite a decrease in transcript levels from RNA seq uencing . Additionally , pulse -chase experiments in cultured pre -B cells showed increased Cyclin D3 protein stability after inhibition of DYRK1A activity. Conclusions: Together, t hese data demonstrate a novel role for DYRK1A in lymphoid development , wherein it contributes to cell cycle exit via at least two convergent mechanisms: DREAM complex assembly and destabilization of Cyclin D3 protein .

In amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS), UPS dysfunction may be central to motor neuron death. Recently, we showed that mutations in UBQLN2, which encodes the ubiquitin -like protein ubiquilin2, cause dominant X -linked juvenile and adult -onset ALS and ALS/dementia. Furthermore, UBQLN2 was identified as a component of pathologic inclusions in ALS and ALS/dementia cases with or without UBQLN2 mutations. Ubiquilin2 is a member of the ubiquilin family, which regulat es the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Functional analysis showed that mutations in UBQLN2 lead to an impairment of protein degradation. Therefore, our findings linked abnormalities in ubiquilin2 to defects in the protein degradation pathway, abnor mal protein aggregation and neurodegeneration, indicating a common pathogenic mechanism. Objective: To explore the pathogenic mechanism of mutant UBQLN2 -mediated ALS and ALS/dementia and to develop an animal model for ALS/dementia . Methods: To further explore the pathogenic mechanism of UBQLN2 -mediated ALS and ALS/dementia, we developed transgenic mice expressing an ALS/dementia -linked UBQLN2 mutation (P497H) using the human genomic DNA transgene. To functionally investigate the UPS in ALS motor neurons in vivo, we crossed the UBQLN2 -P497H transgenic mice with transgenic mice expressing a fluorescently tagged UPS reporter substrate (Ub -G76V -GFP). Complete phenotypic characterization was done using a of behavioral, pathological and neurophysiolog ical tests . neurophysiological features of human ubiquilinopathy. The UBQLN2 -related pathology is characterized by ubiquitin -positive proteinopathy in the impaired synaptic function. Ub -G76V -GFP was found to be accumulated in the double transgenic mice. Cognitive deficits were observed using the Y - maze, Morris water maze and f ear conditioning paradigms. Conclusions: Our data, therefore, provide mechanistic evidence that directly links impaired protein degradation to inclusion formation, defective synaptic function and cognitive deficits, implying a convergent molecular pathw ay involved in neurodegenerative disorders, with implications for development of therapeutic approaches. Presenting Author: Thomas J. Lukas, Ph.D. Position : Research Professor Teepu Title: New Drug Discovery for Amyotrophic L ateral Sclerosis (ALS) Objective s: There is no effective treatment or cure for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), where survival after diagnosis is usually less than 5 years . One of the causative genes, Cu , (SOD1) is about genetically linked autosomal dominant disease. ACTH (Adrenal Corti cotrophin hormone) is one of the products of the POMC gene that has neurotrophic and myotrophic effects, but has not been tested in an ALS mouse model. The objective of this work was to evaluate ACTH in the G93A -SOD1 transgenic mouse model of ALS. Methods: 1. To test ACTH, we used G93A SOD1 transgenic mice expressing a high copy number of the human gene, which develop ALS -like symptoms and pathology within 4 months . All experiments were done under an approved ACUC protocol. ACTHar gel was provided by Questcor Pharmaceuticals (Anaheim Hills, CA). The preparation contains the active hormone (ACTH1 -39) in a gelatin matrix (16%) at 400 U/mL. Mice were given the drug at different doses (120 U or 60 U/kg) every other day or on a weekly regiment. Controls received gelatin only. We began drug administration in presymptomatic 60 -day old animals and continued until end -stage. Animals were tested for changes in weight and rota rod performance during treatment. Results : The administration of ACTHar gel was well tolerated. Even with a fairly large dose (120 U/kg) the mice exhibited no acute side effects. Subcutaneous dose regiments were found to delay onset of disease by 12 to 1 9 days (log rank P=0.0001) Onset of paralysis was also delayed by 6-8 days (log rank p=0.05). Survival was not extended significantly . Surprisingly, the levels of G93A -SOD1 in the brain and spinal cords of treated animals were reduced by up to 75% . (p=0. 001-0.01). We confirmed that ACTH also reduces SOD1 expression in cultured fibrob lasts from the G93A -SOD1 mouse at low picomolar concentrations consistent with activation of the ACTH receptor. Conclusions: ACTHar gel is an FDA approved d rug for a number of diseases (M uliple Sclerosis , infantile spasms) that may be useful for treating familial ALS caused by mutations in SOD1 . Both intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of Acthar gel have been shown to have bio -equivalent e ffects on the cortisol stimulation response , so that human adminis tration requires monitoring of cortisol levels. Presenting Author: Yi Yang, M CRRA Position : Senior Research Technologist Principal Investigator: Department: Neurology Cell -based Assays for Ubiquilin Promoter Activity. Objective: Mutations in UBQLN2 , which encodes protein ubiquilin dominantly inherited, chromosome -X-linked ALS and ALS/dementia. Ubiquilin 2 is a member of a protein family regulates the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. Mutations in ubiquilin2 cause defects in the protein degradation pathway, abnormal protein aggregation and neurodegeneration. Wild - type ubiquilin 2 also accumulates in protein aggregates in ALS (Deng et al. Nature 2011 ). The goal of this work was to develop a cell b ased assay for UBQLN2 promoter activity to screen for compounds that regulate its expression. Methods : A 6 kilobase region of the UBQLN2 promoter was c loned into a lentivirus vector . The construct expresses the green fluorescent protein (GFP) which allows identification of the cells that have incorporated the vector. Additionally, the vector expresses luciferase driven by the UBQLN2 promoter for quantitative measurement of promoter activity. NSC34 cells (a motor neuron -derived cell line) and HEK293 cells were transfected with the vector and GFP positive cells selected and expanded for testin g. Results : The UBQLN2 promoter construct was successfully transf ected into NSC34 (motor neuron like) and HEK -293 cells. The HEK -293 cells exhibited higher luminescence activity than the NSC34 cells and were used for screening of compounds. Computational analysis of the UBQLN2 promoter for transcription factor binding sites revealed that there are putative CREB binding sites. Because CREB is activated by cyclic -AMP prote in as IBMX and H -89 (kinase inhibitor). Both compounds were active in regulating promoter activity. Conclusions : Intervention into a common pathway (UBQLN2 and p62) to increase disposal and d egradation of toxic proteins can be tested using the newly generated cell lines. Larger scale compound screening can be done in 48 or 96 well format. The availability of two different cell lines facilitates validation of positive or negative responses to active compounds.

While inflammasome responses are necessary for host defense, excessive and uncontrolled cytokine production contributes to autoinflammatory diseases. The regulation of inflammasomes, in particular ALR inflammasomes, wh ich respond to cytosolic DNA and has implications for pathogenesis of autoimmune disease, is still poorly understood. Using gene silencing, we identified a novel type I interferon (IFN) -inducible PYD -only protein ALR inf lammasome. Objective: The purpose of present study was to increase our currently limited u nderstanding of regulation of inflammasome assembly and maturation of IL -1 and IL -18 in human macrophages and transgenic mice Sample: Human Macrophages POP3 was silenced by siRNA in human macrophages (hM) and hM were treated with Poly(dA:dT) or infected with DNA viruses. Regulation of ALR Inflammasome was determined by co -immunoprecipitation, GST -pull down and cytokine release. Transgenic mice with macrophage -specific POP3 expression to inhibit inflammasome formation. Silencing of POP3 in hM enhances DNA and D NA virus -induced ALR inflammasome formation and the maturation and release of IL -1 and IL -18. Accordingly, monocytic/macrophage lineage -specific transgenic POP3 expression, which is naturally not encoded in mice, impaired ALR inflammasome responses. Using a DNA virus -induced and AIM2 -dependent infection model, we show that POP3 expression in the monocytic/macrophage lineage is sufficient to blunt IL -18 and IFN --dependent host defense, thereby recapitulating global AIM2 deficiency. Conclusions: We show that POP3 represents a type I IFN response factor that regulates human and mouse ALR inflammasomes in macrophages within a Nagpal, B.Tech, E.

Transforming growth factor - (TGF -) controls the induction of both FMT and cardiac fibrosis. However, the molecular basis of TGF --induced FMT in cardiac fibrosis is no t clear. In this study, we propose a novel miRNA -mediated approach to attenuate cardiac fibrosis by TGF--receptor I (T R1) kinase induces FMT which is associated with differential expression of specific miRNA . Notably , we observed significant upregulation of the miRNA in fibrotic human myocardium aortic and Angiotensin Importantly , we that TGF - induced -miRNA is critical d eterminant for the cardiac FMT and cardiac fibrosis in vivo . Objective: Here, we investigated the molecular basis of cardiac FMT and established the role of novel miRNAs in cardiac FMT induced -fibrosis . Methods : In vitro studies : For FMT studies , primary cultures of human cardiac fibroblasts (HCF ) were treated with TGF - in the presence and absence of small molecule inhibitor of TR1 kinase or inhibitor of MEK -MAPK. Cell morphology was studied by light microscopy. The activation levels of downstream TGF - signaling molecules, Smad, COL1A1, -SMA and PAI-1 were measured by qRT-PCR or western blot analysis. The expression levels of miRNAs were determined by miRNA q RT-PCR analysis. To knock down miRNA s, chemically modified antagomiR were designed against the miRNA . The functional role of a specific miRNA was determined b y transfection of primary culture s of HCFs with miRNA mimics or antagomiRs . In vivo studies: Fibrosis markers were measured both in the pressure overload and AngII model of cardiac fibrosis. Left ventricular of the f ailing human heart s were evaluated for miRNA expression and profibrotic markers . Next, AngII was infused for two weeks via subcutaneous implantation of an osmotic pump in mice (7- 9 weeks old) to induce cardiac fibrosis . Locked nucleic acid (LNA) or cy3-tagged antagomiRs against specific miRNA were delivered systemically to evaluate verify and achieve global knockd own of the miRNA . Masson's trichrome staining was performed to evaluate the extent of cardiac fibrosis in mice and human heart . Systolic blood pressures were recorded via tail cuff method. Sample : Explants of failing human heart , C57BL/6 mice , and human cardiac fibroblast s. Results: We observed that the canonical TGF -/SMAD pathway and not the MEK pathway play a key role in the induction of FMT in primary cultures of human cardiac fibroblasts. Importantly, we have determined for the first time that specific miRNA is significantly upregulated during cardiac FMT. In addition, we observed significant upregulation of the same miRNAs in fibrotic human myocardium and Angiotensin II). Furthermore, o miR NA using mimics augmented TGF --induced FMT. In addition, d analysis revealed that this miRNA directly targets apelin, an anti -fibrotic mediator . Moreover, xogenous treatment of apelin protects AngII -induced FMT. Next, efficient delivery of cy3-tagged antiagomiRs in the heart , liver and spleen was confirmed by confocal microscopy . In vivo silencing of miR NAs in the heart was achieved by systemic delivery of locked nucleic acid (LNA) both in the presence and absence of Angiotensin II. Most importantly, inhibit ion of miRNAs pr otect ed against AngII -induced cardiac fibrosis in vivo . Conclusions : T serine -threonine kinase -induced TGF - signaling and miRNAs are crucial for the induction of cardiac F MT. We conclude that TGF --induced specific miRNA is both sufficient and necessary for the induction cardiac fibrosis in vivo and is a novel repressor of aplein . Overall, o ur data suggests that inhibition of specific miRNAs may serve as a novel therapeutic target to prevent human cardiac fibrosis .

CRS is often divided into 2 clinically and phenotypically distinct classifications: chronic rhinosinusi tis with nasal chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) . Despite the high prevalence and morbidity of chronic rhinosinusitis, little is known about the mechanisms that underlie its pathogenesis. Results indicate that there i s an increased level in complement products C5b-9 and C4d in nasal polyp tissue compared to uncinate process (UT) of patients with and without polyps , and control tissue. Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate the presence and location of complement activation products in nasal tissue from patients with CRS using immunofluorescence. Samples: Patients with CRS were enlisted from the Allergy -Immunology Clinic and the Otolaryngology Clinic of the Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation (N MFF) and the Northwestern Sinus Center at NMFF. UT and nasal polyp tissues were obtained from routine functional endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with CRS. Control UT samples were obtained from subjects without a history of sinonasal inflammation durin g endoscopic skull -base tumor excisions, intranasal procedures for obstructive sleep apnea, and facial fracture repairs. Methods: Tissue was embedded in OCT and frozen at -80\u00b0C. Frozen tissue s were sectioned, fixed and stained for C5b -9. Results: C5b-9 was observed in all CRS tissu e and co -localized with the bas al membrane. Conclusion: C5b-9 is located in the basal membrane of polyp and UT tissue of patients with CRS (In order to be considered for inclusion in the 20 14 Research Day program, ALL abstracts must be in Arial, 11 pt font, and must fit one page.

Our lab recently identified a novel endothelial cell compartment, (the Lateral Border Recycling Compartment (LBRC)) that delivers important proteins to the migrating leukocyte and is require d for TEM. Using biochemistry and subcellu lar fractionation we recently identified IQGAP1 as a protein associated with the LBRC. IQGAP1 is large multi -domain scaffolding protein that has been shown to function in regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements and integrating several signaling pathways. Here we show that IQGAP1 is required for TEM both in vitro and in vivo. Endothelial cells with ablated IQGAP1 expression supported the binding and locomotion of leukocytes to the junction, but failed to deliver the L BRC to the TEM site. Furthermore, by transducing the expression of various IQGAP1 truncation constructs, we were able to show that the actin -binding domain of IQGAP1 is required for critical for its function during TEM . Objective: The purpose of this stud y was to use molecular biology, fluorescence microscopy, and biochemistry to identify the domains of IQGAP1 that are critical to its various roles in endothelial cells , and thus gain a better understanding of the mechanism underlying its function in TEM . Methods: Having initially identified IQGAP1 as an LBRC -associated protein using biochemistry and subcellular fractionation, we next sought to determine how IQGAP1 functions in TEM. Toward this end, we generated stable human endothelial cell lines that had diminished IQGAP1 expression. The migration of primary human monocytes across these monolayers was quantitated using both (PECAM) as a su rrogate marker of the LBRC in order to visualize its movement and enrichment around migrating leukocytes. After confirming the involvement of IQGAP1 in the movement of the LBRC during TEM , we next sought to identify the critical domains of this protein. A series of GFP tagged IQGAP1 truncation mutants were developed for expre ssion using adenoviral vectors and examined for their ability to rescue IQGAP1 function under resting condition and during TEM. Results: IQGAP1 was required for efficient TEM both in v itro and in vivo. Endothelial cells with ablated IQGAP1 expression failed to support TEM, a defect that appears to be due to their inability to direct the LBRC to the site of transmigration. By re -expressing the GFP -tagged IQGAP1 truncation constructs, we found that IQGAP1 is partially localized to the junction under resting condition and becomes enriched around the migrating leukocyte during TEM. Only IQGAP1 constructs that express ed an actin -binding domain were able to rescue IQGAP1 knockdown. Moreover, t he actin binding domain was required for IQGAP1's localization to the junction and enrichment around the migrating leukocyte. Conclusions: These studies highlight the important role of IQGAP1 in the endothelial cell during TEM. IQGAP1 is required for the directed movement of the LBRC during TEM and becomes enriched around the migrating leukocyte. Using domain truncation constructs, the actin -binding domain of IQGAP1 was identified as particularly critical to its various roles.

Although lymphatic patterning defects in global Foxc2 mutant mice have been previously reported, the precise role of Foxc2 in growth and morphogenesis of lymphatic vessels during developmental lymphangiogenesis has yet to be determined. In addition, our group recently found th at another closely related Fox transcription factor, Foxc1, is co -expressed with Foxc2 in lymph sacs, dermal lymphatic vessels, and lymphatic valve forming cells during lymphatic vessel development. Objective: In our study, we generated and examined lymph atic endothelial cell (LEC) -specific single and double knockout mice for Foxc1 and Foxc2 by using tamoxifen -inducible Prox1CreERT2 mice. Methods: We generated LEC -specific single and double mutant mice for Foxc1 and Foxc2 , by crossing mice with tamoxifen -inducible administered pregnant dams at embryonic day ( E)10.5, and lymphatic vessel formation in the dorsal skins was subsequently analyzed by whole mount Lyve -1 immu nostaining at E15.5, a time when maximum activity of Cre -mediated recombination is detected in Prox1+ LECs. Results: We found abnormal morphogenesis of the lymphatic vasculature in the dorsal skin of single and double Foxc mutants at E15.5, a ccompanied by increased LEC proliferation. Our RNA -seq analysis using sorted Lyve1+ CD31+ LECs from LEC -specific compound Foxc1; Foxc2 homozygous embryos revealed that expression of the activator RasGRP3, was significantly upregulated in Foxc1/c 2-mutant LECs compared to control LECs. Given evidence that Ras signaling activates the ERK/MAP kinase cascade and thereby enhances LEC proliferation, we further found that the number of phospho -ERK+Prox1+ LECs was significantly increased Foxc mutant embryos. Conclusions: Foxc1 and Foxc2 regulate Ras signaling to control proper formation of the lymphatic vasculature during development. Further analysis is also underway to characterize lymphatic valve defects in LEC -specific Foxc1 mutant mic e. Presenting Author: Fillan S.

Therapy is determined in part by the number of metastases, protection of functional regions of the brain, and the sensitivity of brain tissue to damage. However, the primary cancer site is not taken into account . Preclinical data from some human cell lines have suggested that human lung cancer and melanomas may use different sources for their oxygen supply . Melanoma metastases tend towards co -opting existing vasculature, while lung metastases were dependent on more classic angiogenesis. Mathematical modeling allows us an oppo rtunity to effectively test this preclinical observation by characterizing human metastatic patterns of growth , visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for these distinct angiogenic phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that co -optive (melanoma) metastases wil l be more likely to be superficial while the classic angiogenic (lung) metastases will have a growth cone that is deeper into the brain parenchyma. Understanding how different primary cancers metastasize could possibly affect treatment selection in the fu ture. Objective: Our objective is to determine if there is a quantitative difference in where circulating (metastatic) tumor cells seed in the brain based on the location of the primary malignancy. Methods: We preliminarily analyzed a sample of patients with primary melanoma or lung canc er and brain metastases. The patients' MRI's were measured to determine the spatial extent of the tumor. The same MRI s were also computationally segmented by in-house software into probability maps of gray matter, whit e matter, and cerebreospinal fluid (CSF) . The two different measurements of the MRIs were co -registered and analyzed using a variety of metrics: Distance from centroid and edge of tumor to cortex Distance from centroid and edge of tumor to grey -white junc tion Percent of perimete r tumor overlapping with cortex These characteristics were calculated using MATLAB . We assumed that the cortex was the demarcation line between the grey matter and CSF outside of the ventricles. Results: Preliminary results indic ate that the percent of the lesion in contact with the cortex may be the most relevant metric for distinguishing between lung and melanoma brain metastases. The two distance measurements were hampered by a number of issues: tumors having convoluted concav e shapes leading to centroids outside of the lesion, large tumors in contact with all three types of brain tissue, and varying MRI resolution in different dimensions. Conclusions: We are encouraged by the continued progress in developing new methods to quantize the different distances between the preferred embedding point of different metastases and the outside of the brain. Our entire cohort contains 78 patients, of which few have been analyzed. As we analyze more patients we except be able to tease o ut the subtle differences. We hope that this analysis will eventually allow clinicians to offer personalized treatment, perhaps by attacking different type of metastases with different angiogenic treatments.

Summary : We have used Next Generation Sequencing , and Agilent Sure Select v4 whole exome sequencing kit , to identify novel mutations in ALS. Objective : Whole Exome Sequencing has become a new means of identifying coding mutations regions of the genome . This technique is done using sequencing methodology such as Next Generation Sequencing and the data are analyzed using high power computing. Methods : Illumina HiSeq 2500 was us ed to sequence 200 samples. The samples were prepared using Agilent SureSelect v4 50 MB. The data analysis using a high powered computing located in our laboratory. The bioinformatics open source tools such as BWA, SAMTools, GATK, Picard and VCF tools were using in combination with shell and Perl scripting developed in house. Over 99% of the exons were covered with average depth of 70x. Results : 350,000 to 450,000 variants per sample were generated , after filtering those out between 500 -800 variants per s ample were found to be frame shift, missense, in the splice site or a small INDEL. In order to filter the variants further we focused in identifying common variant among all of the samples. We were left with few variants which were verified using conventio nal Sanger sequencing. Immunohistochemistry was performed using autopsy samples from patients to explore the involvement of the identified gene/protein in disease pathogenesis. Also, in-vitro cell modeling is currently underway to verify the functionality of identified mutation s. Conclusion : Whole Exome Sequencing as a technique has allowed us to identify rare mutations in both familial and sporadic cases of neurodegenerative diseases.

PECAM and CD99 are two critical proteins at the endothelial cell border that function sequentially to regulate TEM (PECAM upstream of CD99). These proteins partially reside in a novel, intracellular endothelial cell compartme nt, known as the Lateral Border Recycling Compartment (LBRC), which supplies the extravasating leukocyte with unligated proteins and membrane surface area to facilitate its movement across the endothelium, in a process called targeted recycling (TR). While much is known regarding the function of PECAM during TEM, practically nothing is known about CD99 signaling. The C -terminal tail of CD99 is short (39AA) and contains no known signaling motifs. In this study, we elucidate a novel signaling pathway in which CD99 activates PKA through soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) to control leukocyte TEM. Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of CD99 in leukocyte transendothelial migration and elucidate the mechanisms through which this protei ns function. Methods: Cultured primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were used for these studies. A variety of pharmacologic agents were used to inhibit PKA, sAC and tmAC. WB was used to assess activation of PKA. IP was performed to investigate interacting proteins with CD99. Our labs published TEM and TR were used to identify defects in leukocyte TEM and TR. Results: Blocking homophilic interaction of leukocyte CD99 with endothelial cell CD99 arrests leukocytes part way through the endothelial cell (EC) junctions . Here we show that cross -linking endothelial CD99 to simulate its interaction with leukocyte CD99 overcomes this blockade by restoring targeted recycling of the LBRC. Enga gement to mimic this) activates protein kinase A (PKA) via a novel, soluble form of adenylyl cyclase (sAC), ADCY10, which does not associate with G -protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). Activation of PKA (either pharmacologically or by crosslinking endothelial CD99) restores TR of LBRC membrane to the arrested leukocytes, allowing them to overcome the CD99 blockade of TEM. Blocking either PKA or sAC, but not transmembrane adenylyl cycl ase (tmAC), recapitulates the phenotype of CD99 TEM (leukocytes arrested partway) and also prevents crosslinking -mediated restoration of CD99 blockade. Furthermore, inhibition of sAC in vivo blocks neutrophil extravasation to an equal degree as anti-CD99 mAb, arresting cells at the same step of TEM. Mechanistically, sAC constitutively interacts with CD99 (crosslinking does not transiently increase sAC recruitment) and is held at the junction in a novel protein complex involving PKA and the A -kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), ezrin. Ezrin is able to localize subcellular pools of PKA and sAC to CD99 to facilitate proper signaling during leukocyte TEM. Conclusions: Endothelial CD99 signals through sAC to activate and recruit additional LBRC memb rane to facilitate leukocyte TEM. sAC constitutively interacts CD99 in a protein complex with the AKAP Ezrin and PKA. Inhibiting sAC in viv o blocks TEM at the same level as anti -CD99. Presenting Author: [Abbye E.

Formatting follows: Title: E-cadherin is phosphorylated during its biosynthesis to promote strong b -catenin binding, cell surface stability and adhesion Multi -cellular organisms require cadherin/catenin -based adhesion for cellular differentiation as well as tissue architecture and integrity. While the basic requirements of cadherins and catenins for adhesi on have been clearly defined, how this complex is regulated to accommodate its role in collective cell migrations associated with tissue morphogenesis is unknown. It has been long appreciated that the cytoplasmic tail of E -cadherin (E -cad) is phosphorylate d within its beta - catenin (beta -cat) binding region, and that this phosphorylation increases its affinity for beta - cat in vitro. However, the function and regulation of E -cad phosphorylation in vivo remains poorly defined. Using site -directed mutagenesis , we have mapped a minimal set of serines (S840, 846, and 847) in the E -cad tail responsible for all 32 -P incorporation in vivo. We show that this minimal set of serines is responsible for binding to and stabilization of beta-cat in vivo and is required f or efficient cell -cell adhesion. Additionally, we show that these serines regulate E stability. A phosphodeficient (3S>A) E -cad WT or phosphomimic (3S>D) E -cad, and its degradation is blocked by chloroq uine. Moreover, we have observed that 3S>A E -cad is internalized more rapidly than WT or S>D E -cad using both a fluorescence -based assay that utilizes the E -cad tail fused to the extra -cellular domain of IL2R and using cell surface biotinylation experiments on full length E -cads. Finally, we have preliminary data showing that these serines regulate cell motility. More cells expressing 3S>A E-cad migrated through an 8 micron filter in response to an EGF stimulus than cells expressing WT or 3S>D E -cad. Epithelial cells mus t regulate the amount of E -cad at the cell surface according to their morphogenic or adhesive requirements. Our data suggest that E -cad phosphorylation is an emerging mechanism for regulating adhesion in response to signaling events, such as epithelial migrations and EMTs.

Methods : MRI was performed on muscle samples from porcine and leporine species (n = 8) at 1.5 T and 3.0 T. A chemical shift based 2 -point Dixon method was used, collecting in -phase and out -of- phase dat a for fat/water of muscle samples. Values were compared to MFFs calculated from histology. Results : No significant difference was found between 1.5 and 3.0 T (p values = 0.41 - 0.96), or between histology and imaging (p = 0.83) for any muscles tested. Conclusion : Results suggest that a 2 -point Dixon fat/water separation MRI technique may provide reliable quantification of MFFs at varying field strengths across different animal species, and consistency was established with biopsy. The results set a fou ndation warranting larger scale investigation of quantifying muscle -fat neuromuscular disorders. Presenting Author: Charles N.

The etiology of pelvic pain remains unknown. Previously, we found that different strains of E. coli bacteria elicited either no pelvic pain, acute pelvic pain or chronic pelvic pain in murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model . We hypothesize that Streptococcus milleri bacteria can initiate variable pain phenotypes in murine model of UTI. Objective: We investigated whether gram positive species of bacteria isolated from the oral cavity can initiate pain in murine model of UTI. Methods: We exam ined the pelvic pain effect of five Streptococcus milleri bacteria (S. gordonii, S. con stellatus, S.intermedius, S. anginosus or clinical isolate 6363) instilled into the bladder of adult female mice. We assessed bacteria -induced pelvic pain using cutaneo us hypersensitivity to q uantify pelvic pain behavior. Results: S. gordonii and S. constellatus induced no UTI -associated pelvic pain. S. intermedius and clinical isolate 6363 induced a n acute pelvic pain, whereas S. anginosus induced a chronic pelvic pa in. S. constellatus , S.intermedius or S. anginosus lipoteichoic acid instilled into the bladder induced pain states similar to the bacteria while acute and c hronic pain was significantly reduced in both a TLR2 and TLR4 -deficient mice. Interestingly, S. constellatus , which induces no pain, attenuated S. intermedius - induced acute pain whereas E. coli 83972 had no effect on S. intermedius -induced acute pain. Conclusions: Collectively , these findings suggest that S. milleri bacteria induce acute and chronic pain that is initiated by LTA/ TLRs . These observations together with previous studies demonstrate infectious etiology and diversity of pain phenotypes in both Gram positive and negative species . Presenting Author: Hunter K.

M.D. Department: Otolaryngology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Sciences: Basic Science Email: hunter -young@north western.edu Title: Stimulation (INS) Introduction: Pulsed mid -infrared lasers have been used as a method for neural stimulation, including cochlear stimulation. The use of lasers is appealing for many reason s, namely the spatial selectivity and non -contact method of stimulation. The mechanism of INS is believed to be involved with local heating of discrete neuron populations. In cochlear INS, some of the heat is absorbed in the cochlear fluid proximal to the stimulation site, resulting in measurable stress relaxation waves. These waves may vibrate the basilar membrane or directly stimulate hair cells, causing a stimulation by -product. Previous studies have measured pressure waves created by the fiber optic usi ng INS -level stimulation in both free field and in the bulla of a guinea pig. Furthermore, it has been observed that during acute deafening with neomycin, electrical stimulation is possible while optical and acoustic stimulation are not. The goal of the present study is to determine the mechanical contributions of cochlear INS response, and to discover whether electrically -evoked ABRs from the cochlea are a good indicator of cochlear function. Methods: In this study, guinea pigs were chronically deafened w ith a trans -tympanic injection of neomycin. Cochlear damage from the neomycin occurred over 4 weeks. After cochlear damage was confirmed by testing for auditory -evoked CAPs for chronic deaf animals, an optical fiber was inserted through a cochleostomy in t he basal turn. The effect of continuous noise masking on INS was measured with CAPs. After the masking experiment was complete, the fiber optic was removed from the cochlea and an electrode was placed on the round window, with the reference electrode place d the neck muscles. ABRs were recorded for electrical stimulation, with successive turns of the cochlea removed between recordings. The experiment was repeated in normal hearing guinea pigs. Results: Current data shows a masking effect present in normal hearing animals, but not in chronic deaf animals. Interestingly, the level at which masking occurs is correlated to the hearing threshold. Therefore, in good hearing animals masking occurred at a lower SPL level than it did for poor hearing animals. Electr ically -evoked ABRs were recorded in all animals types , regardless of cochlea fun ction . The electrical response diminished by approximatly 30% when the entire cochlea was removed. There were no electrically -evoked responses after the animal was euthanized. Conclusions: The effects of hair cell mechanical stimulation as a result of INS can be seen through continuous noise masking over optical stimulation. When hair cells are damaged or no longer present, INS still generates a neural response that is not mask ed by continuous noise. These findings lead to the conclusion that although INS -induced stress relaxation waves may have some interaction with hair cells, INS mainly occurs through the direct interaction of the radiation and the neuron. Furthermore, it is shown here that electrical stimulation at the round window is not a good assessor of cochlear function.

Formatting follows: Title: [Regulation of mammalian metaboli sm by tristetraprolin ] Summary : Heart disease and stroke are the primary causes of death in adults with type -2 diabetes thus strict metabolic control is essential in these patients. Here, we show that tristetraprolin (TTP), a protein involved in regulati on of inflammation and iron homeostasis via mRNA degradation, may alleviate diabetic phenotype through modulation of key enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and fatty acid (FA) metabolism in insulin -sensitive tissues. Objective : To determine the role of T TP in mammalian metabolism. Sample : Cell culture (HepG2, HL -1) and mice (C57/BL6) Methods : Western blot, PCR, RNA stability assays, metabolic assays Results : TTP protein content was significantly reduced in livers of diabetic mice fed high -fat diet comp ared to control, suggesting that mRNA targets of TTP may be stabilized in diabetes. We then assessed the effects of TTP knockdown using siRNA in HepG2 liver cells on the expression of enzymes in four major metabolic pathways: glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, F A oxidation and synthesis. Consistent with reduced TTP, we found increased expression of a key gluconeogenic regulator - pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 PDK4 five putative TTP bindi ng sites. Importantly, elevated PDK4 levels were previously reported in diabetic patients, and are thought to exacerbate the disease by increasing hepatic glucose output. Assessment of FA metabolism revealed increased levels of PPAR and two of its targets, c arnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) and fatty acid translocase (FAT). Consistent with increased FA flux, triglyceride levels were elevated with TTP siRNA in hepatocytes. In silico analysis rev ealed multiple well - conserved putative TTP -binding sites in the 3'UTR of PPAR, consistent with regulation by TTP. We also observed significant upregulation of PPAR and its targets in HL -1 cardiac cell line, indicating an overlapping function for TTP in i nsulin -sensitive tissues. Notably, cardiac -specific overexpression of PPAR was previously shown to cause a phenotype resembling diabetic cardiomyopathy, further suggesting that reduction of TTP in diabetes may exacerbate this disease. Conclusions : Our s tudies show that TTP is downregulated in diabetic mouse livers, and knockdown of this protein in hepatic and cardiac cells increases the levels of key metabolic enzymes, PDK4 and PPAR, both of which are implicated in diabetes and heart disease (In ord er to be considered for inclusion in the 20 14 Research Day program, ALL abstracts must be in Arial, 11 pt font, and must fit one page.

Since the pulmonary veins and the posterior left atrium (PLA) have been shown to play a significant role in the genesis of atrial fibrilla tion (AF), we hypothesized that PLA myocytes in heart failure (HF) are more likely to generate triggered Ca2+ waves than myocytes from the rest of the atrium. We further hypothesized that reactive oxygen species (ROS) - also known to contribute to AF subst rate - underlie the formation of triggered Ca 2+ waves in the HF atrium. Methods: PLA and left atrial appendage (LAA) atrial myocytes were separately isolated from 3 failing dog hearts (HF induced by ventricular tachypacing at 240 bpm for 3 weeks), and pr e- incubated in either apocynin, which inhibits NADPH oxidase or mito -TEMPO, a mitochondrial ROS scavenger, for 2 to 4 hrs at room temperature. While myocytes, loaded with fluo -4AM, were paced at cycle lengths from 1000 ms to 200 ms, line -scan confocal imag es were taken using Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope. Amount of superoxide (O 2-) from PLA and LAA tissue samples were measured by lucigenin chemiluminscence assay. Results: PLA myocytes showed significantly more triggered Ca2+ waves compared to LAA myocy tes at a cycle length of 300 ms (0.23 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 0.02 \u00b1 0.02; p < 0.05). The frequency of triggered Ca2+ waves in PLA myocytes was significantly reduced by mito -TEMPO (0.23 \u00b1 0.07 vs. 0.04 \u00b1 0.01; p < 0.05), but not by apocynin. Furthermore, O2- content wa s significantly greater in the HF PLA, compared to the LAA (PLA, 91.75 vs. LAA, 30.13; p < 0.05). Conclusions: In HF, PLA myocytes are significantly more prone to develop triggered Ca2+ waves than myocytes from the rest of the left atrium. Since these Ca2+ waves appears to be at least partially ROS mediated and ROS is preferentially elevated in the PLA, anti -oxidant strategies targeted at the PLA may have therapeutic value in AF.

PIM1 has emerged as an attractive target for drug discovery but few PIM1 inhibitors have been tested in vitro or in vivo . In this regard, knowledge of the vulnerabilities of PIM1 -overexpressing tumor cells will be of great value in efforts to develop novel anti -cancer therapeutics. In this study, we show that PLK1 inhibition is particularly effective against PIM1 -overexpressing prostate tumors, possibly due to interaction between PIM1 and PLK1. Further more, PIM1 and PLK1 are frequently co -expressed in human prostate tumors. These data suggest that targeting PLK1 could be exploited for therapeutic purposes specifically in prostate cancer patients with PIM1 overexpression and show the usefulness of RNAi s creen -based approach for identification of tumor biomarkers as well as therapeutic targets. Objective : To identify genes whose depletion is detrimental to Pim1 -overexpressing prostate cancer cells and to validate this finding in vitro and in vivo . Method/Sample : RNAi screening was employed to identify genes whose depletion is detrimental to Pim1 -overexpressing cells. Our finding was validated using shRNA or PLK1 specific inhibitor BI 2536. Xenograft studies were performed using both PLK1 knockdown cell s and BI 2536 to investigate the effects of PLK1 inhibition on tumorigenesis in Pim1 - overexpressing cells. Finally, PLK1 and PIM1 expression patterns in human prostate tumors were examined by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays. Results: polo -like kinase (PLK1) as a gene whose depletion is particularly detrimental to the viability of Pim1 -overexpressing prostate cancer . Inhibition 2536 in Pim1 -overexpressing prostate cancer xenograft mode ls resulted in a dramatic inhibition of tumor progression. Notably, Pim1 -overexpressing cells were more prone to mitotic arrest followed by apoptosis due to PLK1 inhibition than control cells. Furthermore, inhibition of PLK1 led to the reduction of MYC pro tein levels both in vitro and in vivo. Our data also suggest that PIM1 and PLK1 physically interact and PIM1 phosphorylate s PLK1. Finally, PLK1 and PIM1 are frequently co -expressed in human prostate tumors, and co - expression of PLK1 and PIM1 was significan tly correlated to higher Gleason grades. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that PIM1 -overexpressing cancer cells are particularly sensitive to PLK1 inhibition, suggesting that PIM1 might be used as a marker for identifying patients that will benefit f rom PLK1 inhibitor treatment.

Mitochondria are a major site of iron utilization, but the ro le of mitochondrial iron in ischemia/ reperfusion (I/R) injury is unclear. We recently showed that mitochondria iron export is mediated by ATP -binding cassette protein B8 (ABCB8). Objective : We hypothesize that mitochondrial iron has an important role in I/R damage and a decrease in mitochondrial iron is protective against I/R damage through a reduction of ROS. Results: Cardiomyocyte -specific ABCB8 transgenic (TG) mice demonstrated a decrease of mitochondrial iron without impairing cardiac function at b aseline comparing to nontransgenic (NTG) littermates. We subjected ABCB8 TG NTG littermates to I/R (LAD occlusion followed by reperfusion) to study the role of mitochondrial iron in I/R damage. ABCB8 TG mice displayed significantly better cardiac funct ion and significantly reduced apoptosis after I/R compared to NTG littermates. In addition, ABCB8 TG mice have significantly reduced lipid peroxidation products compared to NTG mice, suggesting a ROS -related protection mechanism. To further confirm our m echanism, we utilize pharmacological method to reduce mitochondrial iron in . with BPD but not DFO significantly decreased mitochondrial iron and prevented H 2O2-induced cell death. BPD treatment in vivo also results in decrease of baseline mitochondrial iron without cardiotoxicity . In addition, BPD treated mice have preserved cardiac function a fter I/R. Conclusions : Our findings demonstrate that selective reduction in mitochondrial iron is protective in I/R injury, and show that mitochondrial iron is a source of ROS and cellular damage in I/R. Thus, targeting mitochondrial iron with selective i ron chelators, as studied in our system, may provide a novel approach for treatment of ischemic heart disease.

Special attention is given to molecular mechanism of -caten in effects in the context of its interaction with -catenin, nuclear actin, components of transcriptional machinery and regulation of the gene promoter complex assembly. Methods: 1) Gene silencing and over -expression using lentiviruses and siRNA oligos; 2 ) SYBR - GREEN Q -PCR to characterize gene expression 3) chromatin immune -precipitation (ChIP) to assess direct regulation of gene expression via promoter loading; 4) differential nuclear and membrane centrifugation; 5) in vitro transcription assay to assess Pol II activity; 6) Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP) to assess nuclear pools of the proteins under study. Summary and Results: -catenin is an actin -binding protein required for cell -cell cohesion. While this adhesive function for -catenin is well appreciated, cells contain a substantial amount of non -junctional -catenin that may be used for other functions. We show that -caten in is a nuclear protein that can interact with -catenin and TCF and that the nuclear accumulation of - catenin depends on -catenin. Using over -expression, knock -down and chromatin immuno that -catenin attenuates Wnt/ -catenin -responsive genes in a manner that is downstream of -catenin/TCF loading on promoters. Both -catenin - and actin - binding domains of -catenin are required to inhibit Wnt signaling. A nuclear -targeted form of - catenin induces the formation of nuclear F -actin filaments, while c ells lacking -catenin show altered nuclear actin properties. Formation of nuclear actin filaments correlates with reduced RNA synthesis and altered chromatin organization. Conversely, nuclear extracts made from cells lacking -catenin show enhanced genera l transcription in vitro, an activity that can be partially rescued by restoring the C -terminal actin -binding region of -catenin. These data demonstrate that -catenin may limit gene expression by affecting nuclear actin organization. Conclusions: In sum mary, we demonstrate that: 1. -cat can localize to cell nuclei in a manner that depends on -cat, raising the possibility that -cat regulates an aspect of Wnt/ -cat nuclear signaling.; 2. -catenin limits expression of -catenin dependent genes; 3. Inhibition of expression of -catenin dependent genes by -catenin requires binding to - catenin; 4. Actin -binding regions of -catenin are important for inhibition of expression of the -catenin dependent genes and RNA Pol type II transcription activity. Future studies will be needed to understand how endogenous levels of -catenin affect nuclear actin organization, and how this organization impacts transcription .

The organ of Corti conta ins two types of sensory receptor cells, inner and outer hair cells, as well as two classes of afferent neurons , type I and type II 's. Sound stimulated inner hair cells synapse onto type I afferents and transmit sensory information to the brain (canonical auditory pathway) ; however, it remains unclear if the outer hair cell/type II afferent connection is functional. Here we use Vglut3-/- mice, which do not display any signs of hearing due to a silent canonical inner hair cell/type I pathway, to test for the existence of nociceptor -like neurons within the cochlea. Objective: Much remains to be discovered about the cellular mechanisms that occur within the auditory system following exposure to loud damaging noise (noxious noise). We aim to shed light on the me chanisms of noxious noise sensation and test for the existence of nociceptor -like neurons within the cochlea. Sample: VGLUT3 null mutant mice in a C57BL/6 background generated as previously described (Seal et al., 2008 ). VGLUT3 heterozygous breeding pairs were mated to produce male and female Vglut3-/-,Vglut+/-and Vglut3+/+ littermates from 10 different litters. No statistical methods were used to predetermine samp le sizes. Methods: We have developed two to assays: a behavioral avoidance paradigm to test the quick response to acute loud noise, and a noise exposure assay to test the slow response to prolonged exposure of tissue damaging noise. The noise avoidance a ssay was designed to determine if and how rodents avoid acutely -applied loud noise of intensities of 100, 105, and 115dB. In the noise exposure assay we examine neuronal activity within the cochlear nucleus following sustained exposure to innocuous noise ( 80dB, for 1 hr) and tissue damaging noise (120dB, 1hr). Results : Using the noise avoidance assay, we find that normal hearing mice display nocifensive behavior by avoiding acute exposure to 100, 105 and 115dB, spending less than 36% of the time in a noisy environment. In contrast Vglut3-/- mice do not display nocifensive behavior following acute exposure to loud noise of the same intensity. With the noise exposure assay we find an increase of neuronal activity within the cochlear nucleus of normal hearing mice following prolonged exposure to both innocuous and tissue damaging noise. Interestingly Vglut3-/- mice display neuronal activity with the cochlear nucleus following exposure to noxious \u2014but not innocuous \u2014noise. Conclusions: Overall we conclude VGLUT3 is required for acute nocifensive behavior. However, detection of tissue damaging noise does not require VGLUT3, revealing the existence of a nociceptive pathway from the cochlea to the brain that is VGLUT3 -independent. We term this pathway auditory nocice ption, as it is a hybrid of pain and hearing. Funding: This work is funded by NIH-NIDCD grants 1F31DC012013 -01 ENF & Author: Lauren M.

We have shown that in scleroderma, fibrosis is consistently accompanied by subdermal fat loss and is associated with the down -regulation of PPAR - (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor), a master regulator of adipogenesis that signals through the adipokine adiponectin. Circulating and tissue levels of adipon ectin are significantly reduced in scleroderma. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of adiponectin on fibrotic Wnt/ -catenin signaling. Methods: Primary human adiponectin and the Wnt ligand Wnt3a. Expression of Wnt target genes and fibrotic were analyzed by quantitative reverse -transcription PCR (qRT -PCR) and Western blot. Additional studies using siRNA were conducted to determine whether knocking down the two maj or receptors for adiponectin, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, alters the effects of adiponectin on Wnt signaling. Results : Adiponectin causes a time -dependent down -regulation of both Wnt3a -induced canonical signaling and the mRNA and protein l evels. Mechani stically, these effects involve suppression of both the expression and activation of the Wnt co -receptor low density lipoprotein receptor -related Furthermore, AdipoR1/R2 knockdown studies suggest that adipon ectin is able to inhibit Wnt signaling even in the absence of these receptors. Conclusion s: These results demonstrate that adiponectin inhibits short -term Wnt/ -catenin signaling as well as the Wnt3a identifying adiponectin as a \"natural\" anti-fibrotic agent with tremendous therapeutic potential. Furthermore, these data suggest that adiponectin directly inhibits the Wnt/ -catenin pathway, identifying a novel mode of regulation of this key profibrotic pathway that has been shown to play a critical role in scleroderma. Restoring normal adiponectin signaling thus represents a promising therapeutic approach to prevent or attenuate fibrosis in scleroderma. Presenting Author: Claire G. Vernon Position: Graduate Student Principle Investigator: Geoffrey T. Swanson Department: Pharmacology Clinical, or Basic Science, or Public Health and Social Science: Basic Science Email: cgvernon@u.northwestern.edu Title: Kainate receptor composition in sensory neurons Kainate receptors (KARs), one of three families of ionotropic glutamate receptors, are expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous system, including in those pathways comprising the pain neuraxis. Both human and animal studies support a role for KARs, and in particular GluK1 - containing receptors, in the mediation of aggravated pain rather than acute pain. KARs are expressed in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and in the spinal dorsal horn neurons t hat comprise the targets of DRG innervation. In DRG, KARs are expressed predominantly in IB4- positive C-fiber nociceptors and serve at least two functions: (i) peripheral chemosensing and (ii) presynaptic modulation from afferent termi nals in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. We hypothesize that KAR auxiliary subunits impact the aforementioned receptor functions in peripheral sensory neurons by functionally assembling into DRG KARs. Recently, the auxiliary subunits neuropilin and tol loid-like 1 (Neto1) and Neto2 were shown to profoundly modulate recombinant and endogenous KARs in receptor subunit - and N eto isoform - dependent fashions , and therefore could be important but poorly characterized constituents of KAR function in sensory path ways . We find that KAR kinetics are altered in Neto 2-null DRG neurons , suggesting functional assembly of Neto 2 with native receptors in peripheral sensory neurons . Additionally, deletion of Neto2 reveals KAR kinetics simi lar to heteromeric receptors contai ning GluK1 and GluK5, an interpretation consistent with changes we find in receptor kinetics in GluK5 - null DRG neurons . Interestin gly, adult DRG neurons have KAR kinetics distinct from neonatal DRG neurons but incorporate Neto2 into KARs over time in cultu re. Despite the demonstrated importance of GluK1 in formalin -induced spontaneous pain and hypersensitivity , we find these pain modalities to be unaffected by genetic deletion of Neto proteins and are investigating the role of Neto in other pain behaviors. Elucidation of how Neto proteins shape KAR function in sensory signaling pathways is key for developing a clear mechanistic understanding of the relevance of KARs to sensory transmission and their potential utilit y as therapeutic targets .

Methods: We used a mouse model in which the A/WSN/33 influenza virus (1,500pfu/mouse) was administered intratracheally. In this model, weight loss occurred over time and resulted in 100% death after 8 -9 days. Results: We also observed that the expression of HOIL -1L increased in wild -type C57/B6 mice lung homogenates after 4 days of influenza virus exposure. However, in an alveolar epithelium specific HOIL -1L-/- mouse ~30% of the animals were alive at day 14 post -infection: suggesting that the absence of HOIL -1L in alveolar epithelial cells has a protective role. To understand the mechanism of protection, we evaluated several parameters of inflammation and acute lung injury. The concentration of proteins an d the total number of cells in the broncho -alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were reduced by 25% and 50% respectively at day 5 post infection and H&E analysis of lung slices at day 7 showed decreased injury in the KO mice. Moreover, the expression of pro -inflam matory cytokines such as IFN and \u00df and IL -12 were also decreased in the HOIL -1L knockouts as compared to wild -type. Further studies in -vitro have revealed that silencing HOIL or HOIP in A549 cells decreases NFkB activation and destabilizes the LUBAC comp lex, revealing a possible mechanism for protection. Conclusion: Taken together our data indicates that silencing the E3 ligase HOIL -IL has a protective effect following influenza infection by modulating the activation and production of cytokines. Accordi ngly, our study shows that HOIL -1L/LUBAC mediates the inflammatory response that follows influenza A virus infection which are important for the disease pathogenesis.

Summary: During male -to-female transmission, HIV must bypass the mucosal epithelium of the femal e reproductive tract and gain access to underlying target cells. Previously, we illustrated that HIV is able to penetrate intact columnar and squamous genital epithelia in both ex vivo and in vivo systems. Furthermore, we also previously illustrated that virus enters the squamous epithelium in a diffusion -based mechanism. By utilizing a similar series of approaches, we illustrate transcytosis/endocytosis as a possible mechanism of HIV entry into the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix. Methods: Human cervical HIV of various tropisms. Control samples were incubated with virus in the absence of BafA1/BAF and CP treatment. Following, samples were removed, snap frozen, sectioned, stained and imaged accordingly through deconvolution fluorescent microscopy. Comparison of the image z -stacks pre and post -photoactivation revealed viral signal, accountin g for background. Results: In our human ex vivo control samples, PA -GFP HIV was found to enter the simple columnar epithelium of the endocervix to depths up to 50 microns. We also confirmed that virions penetrated to depths were target cells reside. In contrast, BafA1/BAF and CP treated samples, independent of viral tropism, had a smaller number of penetrating virions. Likewise, deep penetrators (>20 microns) were rarely observed with the majority of virions seen within the simple columnar barrier i tself. Conclusion: Overall, our control samples confirmed that PA -GFP HIV is able to penetrate the intact columnar epithelium, to depths of 50 microns, thereby gaining access to underlying target cells. In contrast, virions in BafA1/BAF and CP treated sam ples were less likely to be observed past the columnar barrier, within the lamina propria. In BafA1/BAF and CP treated samples, a trend in the decrease of the number of penetrating virions was also noted. Collectively, this data may suggest a transcytosi s-based mechanism for HIV -1 entry into the endocervical columnar barrier.

Activ ators of STAT3 such as Oncostatin M (OSM) are known to modulate epithelial function. METHODS: mRNA and protein was isolated from uncinate (UT) tissue and nasal polyps from controls and CRS patients. Normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and na sal epithelial cells (NEC) were grown at air liquid interface (ALI) conditions until fully differentiated and either left unstimulated, or stimulated with OSM. Barrier function was assessed using transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), dextran flux, and tight junction staining. mRNA and protein was isolated from uncinate (UT) tissue and nasal polyps from controls and CRS patients. RESULTS: Analysis of CRS samples showed that OSM mRNA (28.3 fold, p<.01, n=12) and protein (4.4 fold, p<.05, n=12 -19) w ere increased in nasal polyps compared to control uncinate tissue by RT -PCR and luminex assay. OSM stimulation reduced barrier function measured by decreased transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in NHBE cells (63% p<.0001, n=7) , p<.05, n=5) . Staining for proteins, occludin and E -cadherin, showed that junctional staining was disrupted in OSM stimulated NHBE and NEC, while the junctio ns were left intact in unstimulated cells (n=5). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of OSM found in nasal tissue from patients with CRS may play a role in the known loss of barrier function in this important disease.

Summary: Previously, scientists had reported that the initial HIV targets were limited to a specific region of the FRT called the endocervix; however, we now know that potential vaccines and treatments that target only the cervical region of the FRT have failed. This implies that the virus most likely in fects other areas besides the endocervix. Using the two reporter virus vector that undergoes a single round of replication we are able to monitor which parts of the FRT are susceptible to the virus penetration and what is the nature of the first cells infe cted. Our findings demonstrate that the entire FRT including the ovaries and local draining lymph nodes are readily infected and that majority of the initially targeted cells are CD4 positive T cells. Objective: The main focus of this work is to determin e which areas of FRT are targeted by HIV during male -to-female transmission of the virus and to phenotype the first infected cells . Methods: In order to address these questions our lab developed a novel method for detecting HIV in the FRT after vaginal infection. We use the animal model in which the female rhesus macaques are vaginally challenged with SIV pseudoviral vector with JR -FL R5 HIV envelope capable of undergoing the single round of replication. This vector express two different reporters so that we could detect where the virus goes within the FRT, and what specific cell types it targets. The first reporter , called luciferase, causes the virus to emit a yellowish glow and can be detected in intact FRT harvested from the monkeys using a special in vivo imaging system (IVIS) . The second reporter , called mCherry, emits red fluorescence that can be detected using a confocal microscope and allow us to pick out individual infected cells and to phenotype them using variety of cell surface markers. Resul ts: Using the two reporter virus vector , we were able to detect the virus in many regions of the FRT, and not only the endocervix as had been thought previously. By using the in vivo imaging system to detect luciferase, we detected virus in the vaginal tis sue, labia, ecto - and endocervix, and e ven in the ovaries. Lymph nodes also showed signs of infection, although not as consistently. Focusing in on these areas, we were then able to look for mCherry fluorescence in tissue sections with a confocal microscop e to identify individual cells that had been infected with the virus. Infected cells were validated by looking at the direct fluorescence of the mCherry protein and by staining with anti -luciferase antibody. The spectral imaging technique reviled that the infected cells had a single peak at 610nm wavelength when only direct mCherry fluorescence was monitored, while an additional peak at 680nm wavelength was observed when anti -luciferase antibody was used in conjunction with the Cy5 secondary antibody. Trans duced cells identified to date include CD4 positive T cells, identified as mCherry and luciferase expressing cells staining positive for CD4 and CD3. Conclusions: From these findings, we were able to conclude that HIV infects more regions of the FRT than previously believed and that it does not have a preference for discrete regions of the FRT, but rather infects indiscriminately. Our results strongly imply that we need to alter our current strategies for prevention of HIV infection via male -to-female tra nsmission by focusing our energies on developing a vaccine or virus -killing agent that can be widely distributed across the FRT, as opposed to limiting the distribution to a certain area.

This d isease is characterized by the growth of endometrial stroma and glands outside the uterus. Our previous work indicated that retinoid exposure in endometriotic tissue is reduced relative to the healthy endometrium, resulting in blunted estrogen metabolism i n endometriosis. Recently, a novel synthetic analogue of retinoid, called fenretinide has been shown to have decreased toxicity compared with other retinoids. It is a differentiation -inducing agent that promotes apoptosis in a variety of tissues and cell types. Here we test the efficacy of fenretinide for increasing apoptosis in human endometriotic cells in vitro. Sample: Primary endometriotic stromal cells from pre -menopausal women (average age 34 years) were cultured for the experiments. All the experi ments were repeated at least 3 times (n=3). Methods: Primary endometriotic stromal cells were isolated, cultured and treated with fenre tinide at doses ranging from 0 -20 mol. Western blotting, cell number and cell viability assays were performed to examine cell death and apoptosis. Protein and mRNA were isolated to examine the expression of genes involved in RA signaling including STRA6, CRBP1, markers, with PARP and caspase 9 increasing in a dose and time dependent manner. Fenretinide re duced the number of total and live cells in a dose dependent manner . A s imilar decrease in cellular viability was also seen. Examination of the genes involved in retinoid uptake and action revealed that fenretinide treatment induced STRA6 expression, the gene involved in retinol uptake. Conclusions: Treatment with fenretini de decreased cell number and viability and induced apoptosis likely by increasing retinol uptake into endometriotic stromal cells. Targeting the RA signaling pathway may be a promising novel treatment for women with endometriosis.

Objective: The goal of this study was to elu cidate the action of the CD28 mimetic peptide p 2TA (AB103) that attenuates an excessive in mitigating radiation -induced inflammatory injuries . Methods: BALB/c and A/J Peptide (P; 5 mg/ kg of (R; total body irradiation with 8 Gy -rays), and Radiation + Peptide (RP; irradiation followed by p2TApeptide 24 h later). Gastrointestinal tissue damage was evaluated by analysis of jejunum histopathology and immunohistochemistry f or cell proliferation (Cyclin D1) and inflammation (COX -2) markers. Pro -inflammatory cytokines IL -6 and KC as well as fibrinogen were quantified in plasma samples obtained from the same mice. Results: Our results demonstrated that administration of p 2TApeptide significantly reduced the irradiation -induced increase of IL -6 and fibrinogen in plasma 7 days after exposure. Whole body irradiation lead to reduced numbers of intestinal crypt cells and shorter villi compared to the controls. The p 2TApeptide delivery 24 h after irradiation lead to improved morphology of villi and crypts, increased Cyclin D1 expression and decreased COX -2 staining. p 2TAdelivery after irradiation also partially decreased COX -2 staining in spleen . Conclusions: Our stud y suggests that attenuation of CD28 signaling is a promising therapeutic approach for mitigation of radiation -induced tissue injury. Presenting Author: Jennifer J.

Several members of the Ikaros family of zinc finger transcription factors have been reported to play a role in CD4+ T cell development, differentiation, and function; however the precise mechanisms of these processes remain obscure. Here, we show that distinctive N-terminal DNA-binding zinc fingers of Ikaros are involved in the regulation of Th17 cell-associated cytokine expression. Ikaros zinc finger 4 but not finger 1 is required for preventing aberrant upregulation of IL-17 and IL-22 by CD4+ T cells. TGF-b, a cytokine well known for induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs), failed to induce Foxp3 expression but instead promoted IL-17 and IL-22 expression in CD4+ T cells that lack an intact Ikaros zinc finger 4 in an IL-21-dependent manner. The Aryl hydrocarbon receptor and ROR gamma t, key transcription factors for Th17 cell-associated cytokine expression, were regulated by Ikaros both at the transcriptional level and by protein-protein interaction. CD4+ T cells expressing mutant Ikaros protein without zinc finger 4 protected mice from bacterial infection. Together, our data uncovered an intricate interplay among various transcription factors in the regulation of T helper cell differentiation.

Data is accumulating that type II endometrial adenocarcinomas including serous, clear cell, and endometriod histologies share cellular pathway aberrations responsible for a unique molecular landscape. PIK3CA is commonly mutated in these aggressive cancers, leading to a constitutively activated PI3K/AKT pathway and subsequent tumor growth. This pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target. Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare tumor growth and the invasive behavior of aggressive human uterine adenocarcinomas treated with an AKT inhibitor. Methods: Using primary pati ent derived tumor isolates with histologically -confirmed, type II uterine cancer and immunohistochemistry proven over -expression of activated AKT, we examined tumor growth in response to an AKT inhibitor, MK2206, in a renal capsule mouse xenograft model, 3 D polystryrene scaffold, and 2D cell culture. In addition, we used the AN3CA cell line that was derived from a uterine adenocarcinoma lymph node metastasis with a homozygous PTEN mutation. NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice had tumor placed under the renal capsul e and grown for 2 weeks. The mice were then treated with weight -based MK2206 or vehicle control for three weeks and tumor volume was measured. Patient primary isolates and AN3CA cells were grown in 3D culture, and treated with 1 M MK2206, and examined with H&E staining. These same cells were treated with increasing concentrations of MK2206 in 2D cell culture; levels of activated AKT, total AKT and activated PRAS were compared by western blot. To fur ther investigate the aggressive behavior of these tumors; we evaluated the invasive behavior of these cancer cells using a matrigel invasion chamber assay in response to MK2206 compared to vehicle control. Results: Tumor growth of patient derived tissues was notably inhibited in the NSG mice treated with oral MK2206 compared to vehicle control. There was more than a 2 fold decrease in tumor volume in the group treated with MK2206 compared to the control. All the mice survived with minimal toxicity. 3D cell culture is a new platform for cancer investigation and we grew both the AN3CA cell line and patient derived tumor isolates in this model. Additionally, we found an effective dose -dependent decrease in activated AKT in both patient tumor cells and th e AN3CA cell line when treated with MK2206 in 2D cell culture. Regarding invasion, the number of the patient derived tumor cells and AN3CA cells invading the matrigel inserts were greatly decreased by 1 M MK2206. Conclusions: Current treatment of aggressive uterine cancer is poor. These novel models show targeting the PI3K/ AKT path way can reduce tumor growth and minimize invasion. Further studies need to be done, but including a therapy specific to a known tumor mutation may revolutionize and individualize aggr essive uterine cancer treatment . Presenting Author: Newton T.

HL -60 cells, like neutrophils, hav e predominantly the GR -D isoforms. Objective: We determined whether the translation factor heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) plays a role in selective expression of the GR isoforms in HL -60 cells. Methods: Knockdown using HL-60 cells was performed using retroviral transduction. Empty vector was used as controls. Western blot analyses were used to determine the level of hnRNPL and GR isoforms. The expression of GR target genes in cells treated with vehicle or dexamethasone (DEX, 100nM, 6h) were measured using hnRNPL shRNA reduced level of hnRNPL to background level. After hnRNPL knockdown, the GR -D isoform in HL -60 cells decreased significantly and the GR - A isoform increased sig nificantly. Reflecting the switch of the GR isoforms, GR function was altered. DEX increased the expression of IkappaB in control cells but not in cells expressing hnRNPL shRNA. In contrast, DEX increased the expression of GILZ in both control and shRNA expressing cells. In addition, TNF and retinoic acid both decreased the level of hnRNPL and switched the GR -D to the GR -A isoform. Conclusions: The translation factor hnRNPL regulates the selective expression of the GR -D isoforms in HL -60 cells.

Numer ous studies have emphasized the importance of the inflammasome in the pathology of sepsis. POP1 belongs to the PYRIN domain (PYD) -only proteins (POPs) and inhibits inflammasome formation by disrupting the essential PYD interactions between the adaptor prot ein ASC and the inflammasome sensors of the Nod -like receptor (NLR) family, such as NLRP3. Consequently, POP1 blocks NLRP3 - mediated activation of caspase -1 and processing and release of the pro -inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-1, IL-18 and HMGB1 lethality from endotoxic shock in vivo . Thus, POP1 -based therapies could be effective for the treatment of systemic inflammation. Objective: The study objective was to elucidate the function of POP1 during macrophage innate immune responses. Sample: Since POP1 is lacking from mice and evolved in humans, we generated transgenic mice with macrophage -specific POP1 expression and silenced POP1 in human primary macrophages. Methods: Mice were subjected to LPS -induced septic shock and serum cytokine levels and survival were determined. Transgenic bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) or human primary macrophages with silenced POP1 by siRNA transfection, were treated with LPS ex vivo and biochemically analyzed for inflammaso me assembly and for cytokine secretion by ELISA. Results: POP1 transgenic mice had significantly decreased IL-1 and IL -18 serum levels, reduced body hypothermia, and showed significantly increased survival in response to injection of a lethal LPS dose. However TNF- levels were similar between WT and POP1 -expressing transgenic mice, suggesting a specific inflammasome inhibitory effect of POP1 . In agreement, IL-1 -18 secretion was decreased in POP1 -expressing BMDM, which also showed impaired caspas e-1 activation. However, no change in the expression level of IL -1 was detected by real time PCR, indicating a direct inflammasome -inhibitory role of POP1. POP1 silencing in human primary macrophages by transfection of POP1 specific siRNAs led to an incre ase in the release of IL -1, thus complementing our results from mice. Furthermore, LPS induced the expression of POP1 as a late response gene. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that POP1 is a specific inhibitor of inflammasome - mediated activation of cas pase -1 and subsequent processing and secretion of IL -1 in vivo and in vitro . Since POP1 is expressed as a late response gene in macrophages, it likely functions to terminate inflammasome activation to prevent systemic inflammation. The role of POP1 in sepsis may represent an opportunity for future therapeutic intervention.

Somatic stem cells (SCs) are necessary for human uterine fibroid growth; however, the molecular characteristics of these cells remain unknown. Our lab developed a novel way of isolating fibroid SCs using cell surface markers CD34 and CD49b, which avoids the pitfal ls of side population technique for SC isolation and has revealed 3 populations of fibroid cells: CD34+CD49b+ (SC/progenitor), CD34+CD49- (intermediate), and CD34-CD49b- (differentiated). Gene expression profiling was performed on the three populations an d confirmed they are molecularly distinct. Analysis of the data also revealed genes and pathways that may help explain the role of stem cells in fibroid pathogenesis and uncover new therapeutic targets. Objective: Our objective was to determine the differ ential gene expression between these three populations and identify critical pathways that may explain fibroid pathogenesis. Sample: Fibroid tissue premenopausal African American subjects Methods: Fibroid c ells were isolated and sorted by flow cytom etry based on CD34 and CD49b expression. The Illumina Human HT -12 microarray platform was used to identify significantly differentially expressed genes by fold change >1.5 and false discovery rate <5%. Pathway analysis was performed based on the Kyoto Ency clopedia of Genes and Genomes. Real time PCR was performed for validation. Results: Gene expression profiling revealed that the 3 populations of cells were molecularly distinct. CD34+CD49b+ had significant differential expression of 1148 genes (399 downre gulated, 749 upregulated) compared to CD34+CD49- and CD34-CD49b- cells. Genes specific to SCs, such as KLF4, CD34, and CD49b were overexpressed in CD34+CD49b+ cells. Estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER and PR) genes were underexpressed in CD34+CD49b+ cells, and LEF1 and FZD4, both involved in Wnt/ -catenin signaling, were overexpressed. These results were confirmed by real time PCR. Pathway analysis indicated genes involved in cell adhesion, inflammation, apoptosis, wound healing, TGF, IGF and extracel lular matrix receptor interaction were highly differentially expressed in CD34+CD49b+ cells. Analysis also suggested the Notch signaling pathway is important for the function of the CD34+CD49b+ SC population. Conclusions: The results suggest CD34+CD49b+ cells are indeed fibroid SCs with a molecular signature distinct from CD34+CD49- and CD34-CD49b- cells. The lack of ER and PR is indicative of paracrine interactions between SCs and cells with intact receptor expression necessary for hormone -dependent fibroid growth. Additionally, several pathways identified may further elucidate fibroid pathogenesi s and reveal new treatments. Therapeutics targeting fibroid SC action may also prevent the development and growth of new fibroids. Presenting Author: William Liu Position : Graduate Student Principal Investigator: Gayle E.

Previous research has indicated that MIBG is exc luded from the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells , thus limiting its therapeutic effectiveness. This study confirms the distribution of free MI BG in neuroblastoma cells and examines the subcellular distribution of nuclear targeted Fe3O4 core - TiO 2 shell (Fe@T i) nanocomposites conjugated to MIBG. Objective: To examine the distribution and behavior of free MIBG as well as nuclear targeted and untargeted MIBG conjugated Fe@Ti nanocomposites in in neuroblastoma cells w as evaluated by high resolution hard X -ray fluorescence microscopy at cryogenic conditions. Viability assays were performed by MTS, while nanocompo site and nanoconjugate uptake was quantified by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). Successful conjugation of Fe@Ti nanocomposites was confirmed by Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) - Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) and I nfrared Spectroscopy (IR). Results: Free MIBG was found to be widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma cells, but were excluded from the nucleus. We were able to conjugate, successfully, MIBG to an Fe@Ti nanocomposite. This conjugation significantly modulated the cytotoxicity profile of these nanocomposites, although the degree of nanocomposite uptake was left unaffected. A nuclear targeting peptide was then conjugated to these MIBG -nanoconjugates - through XFM, a tomographic dataset was obt ained on a cell of interest treated with nuclear targeted, MIBG -nanoconjugates. After 3D reconstruction, we were able to confirm that indeed, nuclear targeted MIBG nanoconjugates could be targeted to the nucleus of neuroblastoma cells, thus localizing MIBG to a cellular compartment in which free MIBG was found to be excluded. Conclusions: This study confirmed the localization of free MIBG to the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma cells as well as the exclusion of free MIBG from the nucleus. MIBG - Fe@Ti nanoconjugates were cytotoxicity Fe@Ti nanocomposites , left unaffected . Nuclear targeted MIBG -Fe@Ti nanocomposites were shown to localize to the nucleus of neuroblast oma cells. In future studies, we hope to further investigate the effect that nuclear localized MIBG might have on neuroblastoma, and examine if this localization could indeed increase the therapeutic effectiveness of MIBG.

Although the N -acetylated form of GM3 (c - GM3) is expressed in most normal cells, deacetylated GM3 (d -GM3) is mainly found in metastatic melanomas. We have found that decreases in d -GM3 by knocking down either GM3 synthase (GM3S, GM3 to d -GM3) melanoma cell proliferation and/or prevent growth of melanoma xenografts in mice. However, the mechanism of d -GM3 regulated melanoma metastasis is largely unknown. Increased expr ession of AKT3 is known to protect cells from apoptosis in more than 70% of metastatic melanomas. In this we found that /mTOR from apoptosis and stimulate melanoma metastasis.

Vehicle -treated controls consisted of bath application of 0.2% D MSO in the external recording solution ERK1/2 inhibitor u0126 attenuates The level of potentiati on of the PP2-treated group is not significantly different from the vehicle Conclusions: The results of these experiments indicate that ERK1/2 plays a critical role in the induction of mGluR1 -dependent plasticity at this synapse. We hypothesized that the Src family of tyrosine kinases are critical to induction of plasticity by low frequency stimulation and are thus critical downstream effectors of mGluR1 -dependent plasticity . However, we difference between the PP2 -treated, Src -inhibited group and the vehicle treated group, indicating that signaling by a different g enistein -sensitive kinase is required for induction.

Arachidonic acid (AA) metabolites have been shown to modulate CRF expression, however the transcriptional mediators of this modulation are unknown. We are investigating the role of PPRE and XRE sites on CRF gene expression. Objective: Determine the role of PPAR and Ahr in AA -dependent CRF induction. Methods: We used MIRAGE software to identify candidate transcription factor binding sites in a 1kb region of the human CRF gene pro moter. We identified a peroxisome proliferator - activated hormone response element (PPRE) and two Xenobiotic Responsive Element (XRE) sites as candidate mediators of AA -dependent CRF induction. Site -directed mutations of the PPRE and XRE sites were generate d in a CRF -luciferase reporter plasmid. We evaluated expression of WT and the mutants in 293T and B35 cells for their responses to AA and cAMP. Results: Mutation of XRE1 resulted in significantly decreased basal CRF expression, while mutation of XRE2 or PPAR had modest effects. However upon AA induction, the PPRE mutant had increased CRF expression compared to WT, whereas XRE1 had decreased expression. The double mutation of XRE1 and XRE2 resulted in decreased responsiveness to cAMP. Conclusions: These results suggest CRF gene expression is modulated by factors that bind to the PPAR and XRE sites. Continued studies will examine the role of such factors in modulating voiding in response to stress.

During trans cellular invasion the underlying EC forms a circular structure around the invasion pore , which we term transcellular circumferential invasive array (TCIA). The TCIA is dependent on the activities of myosin light chain kinase and myosin II. Here we unravel, from the perspective of the endothelial cell, the underlying mechanism that govern s transcellular invasion. Methods and Results : Here we offer mechanistic insights into transcellular circumferential invasive array (TCIA) formation amid persistent tensile force from activated EC myosin. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments indicated decreased myosin turnover within the invasion pore. S arcomeric distance measurements using super -resolution microscopy demonstrated a maximally contrac ted myosi n network the pore . Electron microscopy highlighted dense parallel actin bundles within the myosin II invasion array. Shape analysis revealed a wide variation in arc angle within the TCIA, indicative of uneven tension along the fibers that comprise the array . To probe the relationship between biomechanical forces and the tension required to maintain the curvature of contractile filaments, we targeted individual actin -myosin fibers at the invasion site for photoablation. We showed that adjac ent filaments rapidly replace the ablated structures. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the TCIA is formed from local reorganization of existing actomyosin fibers, often as a result of stretching, displacement, and breakage by the invading cancer cells. Additionally, the invasion array itself consists of a densely compacted, and highly contracted actin -myosin network , which likely restricts the size of the invasion pore. Our ablation studies suggest that t he increased mechanical stress imparted by the ca ncer cell is countered by the increased strain rate of the actomyosin fibers within the TCIA . Therefore we propose that the TCIA is a structure that provides the necessary constraint within the EC to blunt the radial compression from the invading cancer ce ll. 1.Khuon, S., et al., Myosin light chain kinase mediates transcellular intravasation of breast cancer cells through the underlying endothelial cells: a three -dimensional FRET study.

The patterns of mutations have been utilized to produce mutational signatures , which enable insight into the mutati onal processes. This has the potential to facilitate an understanding of cancer etiology, prevention and therapy . Objective: Recently, The Breast Cancer Working Group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium examined the patterns of somatic mutation s in the cancer genomes of 21 breast canc ers. They generated 5 mutation signatures. The pattern of one of the signatures is similar to that observed when the APOBEC family of c ytidine deaminases is active. Histologically normal tissue adjacent to a can cer provides a window into the early steps of oncogenesis. Comparison of this tissue to the adjacent cancer and to healthy, normal tissue frequently reveals gradation of change exposing a field effect/defect that changes progressively from healthy normal to adjacent normal to malignant. In a comparison of transcription in histologically normal tissue adjacent to cancer to that in normal healthy breast tissue, it was noted that the adjacent tissue appears to be awash in inflammatory mediators. Inflammati on causes genetic damage by the production of reactive oxygen species and the up -regulation of activation -induced cytidine deaminases. We hypothesize that the activation of the APOBEC family cytidine deaminases observed in a subset of the 21 breast cancer s is a conse quence of chronic inflammation. Methods: RNA -Seq data from breast cancer and adjacent normal was downloaded from the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data portal. The epithelia from 20 frozen tissue cores from healthy premenopausal donors to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center were microdissected and the RNA isolated. RNA -sequencing was carried out using the Life Technologies SOLiD Platform. Gene e xpression values from TCGA and sequencing of the Komen normal tissues were merged, quantile normalized, and batch effect corrected. Normalization and differential gene expression was perform ed using Partek Genomics Suite. DNA mutation analysis and non -negative matrix factorization (NMF) were performed to determine t he optimal number of mutational signatures. Results: The expression of APOBEC3c in adjacent normal is 3.4 -times that in healthy normal (p= 4.94E -03). Additionally, reactive oxygen species in the form of nitric oxide are frequently generated by inflamma tory cytokine production of Nitric Oxide Synthase. Nitric oxides can act by directly oxidizing DNA or by damaging DNA repair functions. Our preliminary data reveals that the expression of Nitric Oxide Synthase 3 in adjacent normal is 4 -times that in hea lthy normal (p= 4.55E -03). The optimal number of mutation signatures was three. The mutation signatures resemble those of aging and APOBEC expression . Conclusions: In a review of inflammation -associated cancers published in Scientific American, Gary Sti x remarks that \"Genetic damage is the match that lights the fire of malignancy, and inflammation is the fuel that feeds the flames\". It is possible that inflammation is both the match and the fuel. The up -regulation of APOBEC in adjacent normal is likely the result of the induction of the NF -B pathway in response to the diffusion of inflammatory mediators from the adjacent malignancy. Activated cytidine deaminases under normal, physiologic conditions contribute to the generation of antibody gene diversit y in activated B lymphocytes by inducing somatic hypermutations and class switch recombination of immunoglobulin genes. However, when inappropriately expressed they produce mutagenesis. The differences in gene expression we have identified are some of t he earliest changes in breast carcinogenesis and provide insight into the etiology of this disease and, potentially, its prevention.

Summar y: As is true in all eukaryotes, post -translational modifications affect protein localization and function in Trypanosoma brucei . Palmitoylation, the addition of a 16 - carbon fatty acid to a cysteine, is an essential modification in T. brucei . There are 1 24 palmitoyl -proteins in T. brucei procyclic cells, which are involved in a number of important cellular processes, including signaling and vesicle trafficking. Palmitoylation is carried out by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PAT), of which T. brucei has twel ve. Examination of individual TbPAT RNAi lines revealed that TbPAT7 is responsible for of the flagellar calflagins. Inhibition of calflagin palmitoylation, either site or by TbPAT7 inhibition, causes calflagin to mislocalize to the pellicular membrane. PAT7 is found in the flagellar pocket of procyclic cells, which suggests a cellular trafficking pathway for the myristoyl -calflagins through the flagellar pocket and into the flagellar membrane after palmitoylation. We hypothesized that additional substrates of TbPAT7 might also be flagellar. Therefore, we compared the palmitoyl proteomes of protein. We confirmed that, in addition to calflagin, PIPLC is a PAT7 substrate. Global inhibition of palmitoylation is lethal for trypanosomes , although none of the individual TbPATs is essential for procyclic growth in vitro . We therefore sought to determine the impact on virulence of PAT depletion in a mouse model of sleeping sickness. Mice infected with a TbPAT7 RNAi line were protected from sleeping sickn ess and death.

Summary: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease caused by mutations cyst ic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . The major cause of death in this disorder is lung pathology, which is partially due to epithelial cell dysfunction. EHF is a n Ets family transcription factor expressed in the epithelial cells lining the trachea and bronchi. It can act as either a transcriptional activator or repressor, but i ts targets in the lung epithelium are largely unknown. EHF maps to chromosome 11, in the 11p13 region. A genome -wide association study (GWAS) identified singl nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an intergenic region of 11p13 immediately downstream of EHF that associate with lung disease severity in CF patients. We hypothesize that EHF is an important regulator of lung epithelial function in health and disease s tates, and that it controls a network of genes critical for normal processes in these cells. We used a combination of high throughput methods to determine direct targets of EHF. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP -seq) was used to id entify genome - wide binding sites of EHF. EHF depletion with siRNA followed by RNA -sequencing identified genes regulated by this transcription factor . To determine whether the 11p13 region contains enhancers for EHF and other genes in the region, we perform ed ChIP - seq for histone We identified multiple putative enhancers in the intergenic section and will preform further analyses to determine which gene s they regulate. We found that the majority of EHF binding sites were intergenic or intronic, suggesting that it binds to cis-regulatory elements as well as promoters . EHF knockdown altered expression of genes involved in immune function , cell proliferatio n, apoptosis, and cell motility. EHF binding sites were found near differentially regulated genes, implicating them as direct targets. These results suggest that EHF regulates pathways important for epithelial function . To investigate the role of EHF in re gulation of cell motilit y, a wound scratch assay was per formed on control and EHF depleted cells. EHF knockdown led to a decrease in the rate of wound closure . These studies will shed light on the role of the 11p13 region and EHF in lung epithelial functio n. Presenting Author: Angel A.

Previous stud ies demonstrate the effectiveness of GSK3 inhibition on established glioma cell in vitro and in vivo . Objective: In this study, we test the effectiveness of GSK3 inhibitors and their mechanisms of action using patient -derived glioma stem cells with chara cterized phenotypes . We examine the effects established and novel GSK3 inhibitors using patient -derived glioma stem cells with mesenchymal and proneural subtypes. The use patient -derived glioma stem cells offer a better model of glioma with greater clinica l relevance. Results: In glioma cell GSK3 inhibition induces apoptosis through -MYC activation, mitochondrial destabilization, and reduction of NF -B activity. We have characterized a novel set of GSK3 inhibitors for their ability to inhibit glyc ogen synthase phosphorylation, reduce levels of XIAP, and induce cell death in cancer cells. However, it is uncertain if this mechanism is functional with respect to cancer stem cells and glioma tumor subtype. The need to investigate the mechanistic effect s of GSK3 in cancer stem cells is important given their malignancy, innate resistance to therapy, and tumorigenicity. Moreover, the intracellular signaling and transcription networks may differ in glioma stem cells, particularly among cells with different subtypes. We have recently demonstrated that cancer stem cells isolated from glioma patients can be segregated into either a proneural or mesenchymal subtype based on their gene expression pattern. The oncogenic activity of genes like c -MYC in glioma stem cells and differences between glioma stem cell subtypes, such as NF -B activation, raises questions as to whether GSK3 inhibition will be effective against both subtypes and if their effects utilize distinct mechanisms of inhibition. Our in vitro data show s that GSK3 inhibition significantly reduces growth and causes cell death in both proneural and mesenchymal glioma stem cells. Conclusion: Using a glioma stem cell xenograft model, we test the effectiveness of GSK3 inhibition as a single agent and in con junction with clinically -approved chemotherapeutic agents. The characterization of cancer stem cell inhibitors and their effectiveness in different tumor subtypes has significant clinical implications. Our work supports the therapeutic potential of novel G SK3 inhibitors for the treatment of malignant gliomas.

In surgical applications, the radiation wavelengths of las ers in the far ultraviolet and near infrared spectral regions are ideal for ablating tissue that has high contents of collagen (absorption peak around 190nm) and water (absorption peak around 3,000nm). Changing the wavelength of a laser across the absorpti on peak will alter laser -tissue interactions, thus varying its penetration depth, radiant energy density, and ultimately, surgical capability. Several commercial infrared lasers are currently available, but their fixed, single wavelength output limits vers atility in surgical applications. Conversely, an individual, tunable laser could optimize laser -tissue interactions for ablation and coagulation in a variety of tissues and minimize collateral heating effects in a tissue -specific manner. At present, such a laser does not exist, with the exception of the Free Electron Laser (FEL). The goal of this study is to demonstrate efficient ablation of various tissues with reduced collateral damage using a tabletop mid -IR laser tunable between 3,000 nm to 3,500 nm. Methods: A novel infrared (IR) laser system was designed and constructed by combining a laser oscillator and subsequent amplifier modules. Specifically, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO), based on large aperture periodically poled stoichiometric lithi um tantalate (PPSLT) crystals, was pumped by a Neodymium -based laser amplifier to generate high average power and high pulse energy. By changing the temperature (40OC up to 265OC) of the PPSLT crystals, the conditions in which photons of energy were split could be changed. Therefore, it was possible to tune the laser continuously from 3,000 to 3,500 nm. To test the laser, cadaveric mouse liver was exposed to the laser. Following irradiation tissue was embedded, serial sectioned at 5 m, mounted on glass sli de, and stained with Luna. Bright field images of selected sections were examined with a light microscope after they were captured with a Spot Insight Color camera at 10x and 20x. Cadaveric mouse liver was also exposed to a CO 2 laser as a control to compar e the ablations to the novel IR laser. Results: The laser device was tested for its ability to ablate tissue and for corresponding tissue damage. The selected laser parameters for the novel instrument were sufficient for mouse liver tissue ablation at ea ch tested wavelength. Compared to the ablations produced from a CO 2 laser, the ablations produced from the novel infrared laser exhibited reduced thermal collateral damage. Conclusions: Based on the ablations produced in mouse liver tissue during this st udy, the novel infrared laser is capable of effectively cutting tissue at different wavelengths. Furthermore, the reduction of collateral thermal damage surrounding these ablations, compared to ablations produced by a CO 2 laser, suggests that this laser is less harmful to surrounding tissue than traditional lasers. In this ongoing study, where various tissues continue to be exposed to this laser under different parameters, the understanding of laser -tissue interaction is deepened with the ultimate of goal of producing a useable surgical instrument in the future.

N eurogenic cystitis induced by inject ing Bartha's strain of pseudorabies virus (PRV) into tail base muscle of mice recapitulates hallmarks of IC, including pelvic pain. We recently reported that BALB/ cJ female mice develop significantly greater pelvic pain responses than C57BL/6J female mice . Here, we employed quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis to identify loci associated with pelvic pain severity. Methods: We generated 96 F2CXB female mice derived from a cross between C57BL/6J and Balb/c J. F2 mice were infected with PRV, and pelvic pain was scored in response to von Frey filament stimulus. Purified F2 tail DNA w as genotyped with Illumina Mouse MD arrays containing R/qtl softw are. Results: A potential QTL exceeding an arbitrary significance threshold was identified on chromosome 13 (LOD=3.11) . A weak QTL on chromosome 3 failed to achieve significance . The QTL on chromosome 13 was confirmed using C\u00d7B -6 recombinant - inbred mouse strain that exhibited increased pelvic pain in response to PRV . Expression analysis revealed that single locus near rs6314295, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), was induced PRV -infected mice. AOAH -deficient mice exhibited increa sed at baseline and during PRV -induced cystitis. Conclusions: These findings indicate demonstrate that AOAH modulates pelvic pain severity in neurogenic cystitis and suggest that allelic variation in AOAH may underlie differential pain phenotypes in pelvic pain syndromes.

Tissue -specific CFTR expression is regulated by multiple , including intronic enhancers , which i nteract with the promoter. The mechanisms that organize higher order chromatin structure to establish and maintain gene expression are not fully understood ; however, data suggest they may involve CTCF and cohesin . These factors have important roles in the three -dimensional organization of loci and at insulator s, which are critical barrier s for prevent ing inappropriate activation or repression of genes. To determine the functions of these proteins at the CFTR locus , we used an siRNA - and SMC1, after CTCF or RAD21 depletion shows loss of all three factors at several sites across the region and retained occupancy at others. After RAD21 knockdown , quantitative chromosome conformation cap ture (q3C) data reveal a partial loss of interactions across the locus between the gene promoter, known enhancers such as the one in intron 11, and CTCF/cohesin binding sites. In contrast, after CTCF depletion no changes in enhancer -promoter interactions a re observed; however, interactions between the -20.9 kb insulator element and CTCF/cohesin binding elements 3' to CFTR are suppressed. These data suggest that cohesin and CTCF have distinct roles in the chromatin organization of CFTR . We also show that add itional components of the chromatin looping complex at CFTR include tissue -specific transcription factors such as FOXA1 and FOXA2, which are responsible for some of the enhancer -promoter associations. Furthermore, depletion of CTCF or the cohesin componen t, RAD21 , leads to an increase in CFTR mRNA levels, and analysis of histone modifications suggests that a mechanism of repression may involve changes in transcription factor binding and the chromatin landscape of CFTR .

Our group characterized global chromatin alt erations associated with a mutant version of MMSET. This specific mutation, E1099K, is found to recur in established cancer cell lines and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) patient cohorts. Our research showed that ALL cell lines expressing MMSET E1099K pos sessed elevated levels of (H3K36me2) without overexpression of MMSET . This gain of function linked to MMSET E1099K also diminished global levels of trimethylation at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which is a distinct chromatin modification frequently associated with transcriptionally silenced genomic regions. Since overexpression of MMSET with E1099K is not an optimal way to characterize this mutation , we adopt the latest genome targeting technique CRISP R/Cas9 system to target MMSET exon18 at the E1099K site to establish a MMSET E1099K mutation model . We hypothesize that global chromatin alterations generated by the MMSET E1099K mutant produce aberrant gene expression patterns in ALL, and furthermore, a s ubset of these misregulated genes are responsible for maintaining particular cancer phenotypes of ALL. Objective: Our objective is to characterize the recurrent point mutation E1099K of MMSET to understand how this mutation alter MMSET enzyme activity an d misregulate downstream genes. Method: The histone modifications of e stabl ished ALL cancer cell lines with wild type and E1099K mutation were analyzed by western blot and mass spectrometry. HEK293T cells and ALL cells were used to test CRISPR/Cas9 target ing. Result: Both western blot and mas s spectrometry results indicate that ALL cell lines with E1099K mutation have high level s of H3K36 dimethylation and decrease s of H3K27me3 in the absence of overexpression of MMSET protein . We were able to use CRISPR -mediated genome targeting method to make site -specific DNA double strand cleavage at MMSET E1099K site in ALL cells. Conclusion : We believe the MMSET E1099K mutation causes upregulation of MMSET activity, deregulation of chromatin epigenetic marks, altera tion of gene expression and cell in lymphoid malignancies. Since overexpression of MMSET with E1099K is not an optimal way to characterize this mutation, we are working on the CRISPR -mediated genome engineering technology to establish an E1099K muta tion model in ALL cells, to study genes misregulated by the MMSET E1099K mutant and to gauge the individual contribution of these events in ALL . Meanwhile, in vitro biochemical assays, animal models will also be performed to understand the mechanism of MMS ET E1099K pathogenesis. Overall, our study leads to a better understanding of the epigenetic regulator and its mechanism in oncogenesis, and may provide insight of potential therapeutic target for treatment of hematologic malignancies.

Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) are repeating sequences of 2 -6 bps of DNA, located in both noncoding and coding regions of genes. DNA methylation in certain STRs has been shown to contribute to the development of various diseases, including cancer. However, the characterization of DNA methylation in STRs throughout the human genome remains largely unknown. Objective : To characterize STRs cross the human genom e using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450K array), and estimate the correlation of DNA methylation with STRs independently using pesticides exposure data. Methods: To locate the STRs associated with 450K probes, we used the 450K array to exami ne DNA methylation level throughout the genome, and retrieved STRs in the 1050 bps DNA region which included both 500 bps upstream and downstream DNA sequences of each probe. For each probe, we obtained the STRs factors, including counts of CG and GC, STRs repeats size, copy number, and distance to the probe. Based on their repeat size (2 to 6) , these probes were divided into 5 groups, and tested with Wilcoxon Rank -Sum Test to examine the methylation level of each group against the rest. For each group, we utilized linear regression analyses to determine the association of DNA methylation level with these STRs factors. Results: Of all the 450K probes, we found 29,528 probes with STRs, and 27,446 of them were kept for analysis. The Wilcoxon Rank -Sum test resu lts showed significantly difference in methylation level of each repeat size group against the rest (P-values were 2.2E-16, 2.2E-16, 2.2E-16, 3.803E -05, and 2.2E , and linear regression analyses showed DNA methylation level was associated with the CG and GC counts, distance between STRs and probes, copy number and the repeat size. Conclusion s: The CG and GC counts, copy number, repeat size and the distance to probes of STRs may determine their DNA methylation level.

Oral food challenge remains t he gold standard for food allergy diagnosis, but this is time consuming, costly and puts patients at risk for a severe reaction. Specific IgE (sIgE) and Skin Prick Testing (SPT) aid in food allergy diagnosis and surveillance, but do not accurately predict clinical food reactivity or sever ity of reaction. The Basophil Activation T est (BAT) is an emerging diagnostic tool in the evaluation of food allergy but is not well studied . Objective : To evaluate the Basophil Activation T est (BAT) as a diagnostic tool in the evaluation of tree nut and peanut food allergy in children. Methods: 87 children (48 nut allergic and 39 controls) enrolled in an ongoing cross - sectional study were analyzed. Historical inf ormation regarding allergic reactions, atopic history , sIgE and SPT were reviewed. Children were categorized as having food allergy by allergist -immunologist diagnosis (typical symptoms of type 1 reaction within 2 hours of ingestion and evidence of food sIgE and/or SPT greater than the 95%PPV standard cut off values) . A subset of 20 patien ts (9 nut allergic and 11 controls) had blood drawn for the BAT. W hole blood samples were stimulated with (1) relevant food antigen (peanut and/or relevant tree nut ), (2) non -relevant antigens (nu ts patients eat ad lib and/or ova if eating egg ), (3) AntiIgE antibody; FMLP (positive controls) and (4) media alone +/ - IL-3 (negative controls). Activated basophils were defined by means of flow cytometry as CD63+CD123+CD203+HLA -DR\u2014CD41a\u2014cells. Basophil activation greater than 5% and SI >2 was considered a positive test. Results: In this study, the o verall concordance of the BAT with peanut, tree nut and/or egg allergy diagnosis was 83%. Concordance was highest for tree nut and lowest for peanut. The BAT had an overall sensitivi ty of 90% and specificity of 82% for the diagnosis of peanut, tree nut and/or egg allergy . The test has an overall positive predictive value of 57% and negative predictive value of 97 %. Conclusion: The BAT has superior specificity, but is less sensitive for food allergy diagnosis when compared to SPT and sIgE using standard cut off values of >3mm and >0.35I U respectively. The BAT may therefore be a useful additional test in the diagnosis of food allergy. It may be par ticularly useful in ruling out food allergy in cases of preventative avoidance. However, the BAT cannot replace the current gold standard of food allergy diagnosis, the oral food challenge .

New generation anti -progestins lack the high anti -glucocorticoid activity of older agents; we evaluated one of these (CDB4124, telapristone) for specific inhibition of PR binding to the progesterone receptor element (PRE); effect on cell proliferation in T47D cells; and expression of PR target genes in normal human breast microstructures cultured i n 3D conditions. Methods: To measure PRE activity in T47D cells dual luciferase reporter assay was performed, cells transfected with PRE -luc plasmid and treated for a 24h with vehicle, progesterone (P4), medroxyprogesterone (MPA), or a PR agonist (R5020), as well as three doses of CDB4124 (10nM, 100nM, 1\u00b5M) alone or in combination with P4 or MPA or R5020. Separately, T47D cells were simulated E2 plus P4 with and without CDB4124 for 72h and processed for cell cycle analysis by flow cytometer. For measurement of PR target genes, normal human breast microstructures were isolated after digestion of reduction mammoplasty samples. These microstructures were treated with E2 and P4 alone or in combination with CDB4124 for 24h. RNAs were collected after 24h and rever se-transcribed to cDNA for real time PCR. All experiments were performed in triplicate. Results: Increased in relative luciferase activity indicate an increase in PRE activity of T47D cells when treated with R5020 (2212.36\u00b153.11 RLA) 10nM alone compared to vehicle (33.08 \u00b1 10.16 RLA). In contrast, 1\u00b5M CDB4124 alone have similar PRE activity (26.64 \u00b1 3.94 RLA) in comparison to vehicle. The hormone - stimulated PRE activity was completely inhibited in T47D cells treated with 1\u00b5M CDB4124 combined with P4 (25.758 \u00b1 2.32 RLA) or MPA (32.21 \u00b1 2.46 RLA). In cells treated with R5020 plus CDB4124, 80% of PRE activity was inhibited (476.57\u00b1 5.72 RLA) in comparison to R5020 alone. Cell cycle data in T47D cells using flow cytometry showed significant arrest in G1 with CDB4124, relative to cells treated with hormone alone. The S -phase fraction also showed significant dec rease when1\u00b5M CDB4124 was added to cells treated decrease). CDB4124 treatment also led to decrease in expression of PR target genes i.e. RANKL, SKG1, FKB5 in normal breast microstructure in 3D culture in presence of P4 [50nM] alone or in combination with 1nM E2 [50nM].Conclusion: CDB4124 is a potent antiprogestin; it abrogates PRE activity in the presence of R5020, or P4, or MPA. Furthermore, significant inhibition of hormone -induced cell proliferation is observed in T47D cells treated with CDB4124. In addition, PR target gene expressions were inhibited in normal breast microstructures, Based on these results, we expect that targeting PR by CDB4124 will inhibit PR regulated genes invol ved in cell proliferation and survival of breast cancer cells.

Summary: Corn eal epithelial homeostasis and regeneration is maintained by a per ipheral rim of limbal epithelial stem cell s that gives rise to more differentiated progeny in the centrally located corneal epithelium. The molecular basis for organizing limbal and corneal epithelial tissue compartments remains poorly understood. Eph rece ptor tyrosine kinases are activated by ephrin ligands present on adjacent cells. These receptor -ligand signaling complexes regulate tissue patterning and boundary formation at least in part by differentially modulating cell adhesion and repulsion. Interest ingly, ephrinA concentrated in the limbal epithelium whereas the EphA2 receptor is more abundant in the corneal epithelium . These observations led us to hypothesize that EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling complexes regulate cell -cell adhesion and repulsi on events that help establish a functionally integrated boundary between limbal -corneal epithelial cell compartments . Objective: Our long -term goal is to elucidate how EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling complexes regulate human corneal epithelial tissue homeostasi s. Methods: A novel cell confrontation co -culture system containing human corneal epithelial cell s engineered to express ephrinA1 or EphA2 was used to determine the ability of these receptor -ligand signaling complexes to establish and maintain limbal -corneal tissue boundaries . Results: Human corneal epithelial (hCEpi) cells express high levels of EphA2 and low levels of ephrinA1 in primary culture . Retroviral transduction of ephrinA1 into hCEpi cells led to the down - regulation of EphA2. In contrast, EphA2 gene silencing increase d the levels of ephrinA1. Collectively, these findings su ggest that ephrinA1 and EphA2 levels are reciprocally regulated in hCEpi cells reflecting the differential distribution of these ligand s and receptor s in human limbal and corneal epithelium, respectively. To determine the functional import of this reciprocal expression pattern, we re-established a boundary between ephrinA1/ mCherry -hCEpi cells expressing endogenous EphA2 by seeding these two cell populations into discrete zones that were subsequently permitted to confront one another in a co -culture model . While mCherry -hCEpi EGFP -hCEpi cells, ephrinA1/ mCherry cells formed a distinct boundary with reduced E -cadherin membrane expression after coming into contact with EphA2 expressing EGFP -hCEpi cells. EphA2 was specifically required for responses ephrinA1 /mCherry -hCEpi cells as EphA2 knockdown or overexpression mutant lacking a cytoplasmic domain in EGFP -hCEpi cells failed to establish a distinct tissue boundary or alter E - cadherin membrane localization. To gain insight into the mechanism of Eph/ephrin -mediated boundary formation, we focused on ADAM -10, a meta lloproteinase known to associate with E phA2 that also cleaves ephrinA1 and E -cadherin. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition ADAM -10 led to cell-surface stabilization of ephrinA1 and E -cadherin with a concomitant loss of EphA2 in hCEpi cells. Accordingly, ADAM -10 inhibition prohibited the a bility of ephrinA1/mCherry -hCEpi cells to establish a boundary with EGFP -hCEpi cells. Conclusions: Our cell confrontation co -culture studies suggest that e phrinA1 expression allows for limbal epithelial cells to establish a boundary with adjacent fields of corneal epithelial cells expressing EphA2 in vitro , supporting a role for EphA2/ephrinA1 signaling complexes in normal limbal -corneal epithelial tissue compartmentalization. These findings have implications for diseases where the limbal -corneal boundary is compromised such as limbal stem cell deficiency, chronic inflammation and diabetes.

Department: Pathology Clinical , or Basic Science , or Public Health and Social Basic : The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) include a spectrum of stem cell m alignancies characterized by an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia. Heterozygous loss of chromosome 5q (del(5q)) is the most common cytogenetic abnormality in MDS. DIAPH1 is localized to 5q31 and encodes one of the formin proteins, mDia1, which is involved in the regulation of linear actin polymerization. Mice with mDia1 deficiency develop hematologic features with age mimicking human myeloproliferative neoplasm, but its role in the pathogenesis of MDS is unclear. Here we report that CD14 i s aberrantly overexpressed on the granulocytes of mDia1 heterozygous and knockout mice in a cell -autonomous manner, leading to a hypersensitive innate immune response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimuli through CD14/Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. C hronic stimulation with LPS accelerated the development of MDS in mDia1 heterozygous and knockout mice. Similar findings of CD14 overexpression were observed specifically on the bone del(5q) MDS patients. erythroid genes and a specific upregulation of CD14 in granulocytes. These results underscore the significance of mDia1 heterozygosity in deregulated innate immune responses in del(5q) MDS. Key Points : Loss of mDia 1 led to cell -autonomous overexpression of CD14 on granulocytes and hypersensitive innate immune response . Mice with mDia1 deficiency developed age dependent MDS which was accelerated by chronic stimulation of innate immunity .

Limit one page . Formatting and glycolipids. The biophysical properties of eukaryotic flagellum/cilium are of special interest because of the broad sensory roles played by the flagellum. Trypanosoma brucei, the agent of human African sleeping sickness, is a protozoan parasite consisting of a single polarized flagellum. The surface membrane of this kinetoplastid is partitioned into flagellar, flagella pocket and pellicular domains. While its purpose i n T. brucei motility is self -evident, the sensory function of the flagellum remains undetermined. Here, we report the evaluation of whole cell T. brucei lipidome compared to its flagellum, characterized using ESI -MS. We found T. brucei flagellum to be enriched in cholesterol, ergosterol and lanosterol and depleted in myoinositol compared to the rest of the body. This is consistent with our previous data that the flagellar membrane of T. brucei has a specialized lipid composition with increased concentra tions of sterols and saturated fatty acids required for lipid raft assembly. Through the ongoing functional characterization of differential lipid distribution in T. brucei flagellum, especially in the realm of signal transduction, we hope to gain insight into the molecular determinants involved in flagellar sensory function and trafficking.
