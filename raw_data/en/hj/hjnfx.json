While many of us go to great lengths to fuel our bodies with foods full of nutrients, the fact is the average American diet is loaded with added hidden sugars, unhealthy trans fats, nutritionally void processed foods (that keep you coming back for more), and immense portion sizes. Environmental toxins are of increasing concern as well. In the U.S. we allow over 10,000 chemical additives in our food supply. The average person consumes 14 pounds of additives and 150 pounds of sugar per year. For many athletes training takes its toll. Not only do they need to consume 2 to 3 times more calories than your average person, but they are looking to do it in a way that is time, nutrient, and taste dependent. Sometimes that requires eating foods they might be better off not eating. Here's the fix: Common signs that your body is overloaded with toxins: - constant hunger (cravings are a sign of poor diet or lack of nutrient absorption) - feeling unrested (primary factor here is stress) - muscle and joint pain (rampant inflammation leaves us sore all over) - digestion related issues - loss of mental clarity Why Do i need a Purification Program? Similar to what we mentioned above, is the exposure to environmental toxins. The food we eat, the water we drink, the air we breathe, and the large amount of chemicals in everything from cleaning supplies to the clothes we wear can affect our bodies ability to fight invasions and absorb the nutrients we need. The purification program is intended to give your organs a chance to catch up, so to speak. The liver needs time to do its toxin elimination and is often overloaded which can go unnoticed until significant damage has occurred. Not only that, but it will help the body remove stored toxins. The toxins mentioned above (pesticides, preservative, food additives, heavy metals, plastics, etc.) tend to be fat-soluble which means they are stored in fat. So if you are trying to lose weight and burn off fat, its likely these toxins are moving readily throughout the body. The purification process allows the body to spend more energy in removing these toxins from the organs and flushing them out in a safe and efficient manner. Benefits of a purification Removing toxins weighing down the body is far reaching. Many people report an overall sense of feeling lighter, improved issues in the bathroom, less bloating, clearer thinking, more control over food choices, less cravings, a deeper understanding of craving vs hunger, improved sleep, a decrease in nearly any skin issue, improved mood, and much more. Everyone responds to the program differently. - Some people who drink a lot of caffeine recognize a decrease in need for stimulants. -For those who get those late afternoon cravings find planning and improved nutrition will eliminate the bodies cravings. - For those who just can't get over the hump to start losing the weight they desire, will notice improved momentum towards that goal (this is not a weight loss program, indirectly it will help you reach the goals you set out to achieve). OK, what do I have to do? I would like to say this is the easy part, but it isn't. The 21 Day Purification Program will test you each day. However, with each day of success it does get easier, and you will feel immediate changes. The program is designed to eliminate the inflammatory foods in our diet and replace it with food that help with fuel our body. The first 10 days is a variety of vegetables and fruit, adding in select proteins on day 11 (for our athletes we do recommend the Standard Process whey protein as well). To compliment the better food choices, Standard Process has supplements and shakes (as the days pass you will really look forward to these). Standard Process provides an app, a food journal, webinars, a shopping list and plenty of recipes to choose from. For more information and to look at the patient "}
