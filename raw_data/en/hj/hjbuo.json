T he category of 'Prescription- Only' drugs was codified into law by 1951. The thalidomide tragedy in the early 1960 heralded the modern regulatory syst em in most western countries. 6Safety Elements Increasing importance globally Safety related activities - Regulatory authority has been more limited and indirect Moving toward more ac tive Pharmacovigilance - PSURS - Post marketing studies - Registries - Risk Management plans (periodicity driven by risk) - Improved communicationADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 4 7Periodic Safety Update Reports - PSURs Present worldwide safety experience of a medicinal product at defined time s post-authorization: - Report all relevant new safety information; - Relate to patient exposure; - Summarize market authorization status in different countries - Any significant variations related to safety; - Create periodically the opportunity for an overall safety re-evaluation; - Indicate whether changes should be made to product information in order to optimize the use of the product. 8Two Phases of Safety Reporting 1. Development / Premarket ADR reports Special reports of unexpected clusters - DSMBs, Clinical Trial St eering committees, REBs; DSURs - Periodic safety reporting during clinical trials (modeled after the PSUR for marketed products). 2.

FDA provides guidance documents to industry that focus on risk assessment and minimization during different stages of a drug's life cycle and gives direction regardin g the development, implementation and evaluation of risk management activities. The US FDA will focus on products that pose an unusual type or level of risk. The proposed legislation is to use REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies) that would require manufacturers to submit RMPs. 14ADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 8 15European Medicines Agency Model The legislation requires t hat an RMP (Risk Management Plan) be submitted to regula tors for (almost) all new products from MAHs. The EMEA states: - RMP submitted with applications for new medicines and generic products - When there is a significant change in conditions of use for an authorized product - When a safety concern is identified - When requested by a national regulator - The EMEA focus is on an RMP on activities that take place after a drug is marketed. 15 1616Scope The Canada Vigilance Program collects adverse reaction reports for the following marketed health products approved for use in humans: Pharmaceutical drugs (prescription and non-prescription) Biologics (Schedule D, biotech nology products, therapeutic and diagnostic vaccines and fractionated blood products) Radiopharmaceutical drugs Natural health productsADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 9 1717Adverse Reaction Reports Domestic Adverse Reaction Reports - Serious Adverse Reactions - Reports concerning reactions occurring in Canada to a product that is marketed in Canada - Market Authorization Holder report within 15 calendar days of receiving the information (expedited reporting) - Unusual failure in efficacy reports for new drugs Foreign Adverse Reaction Reports - Serious Unexpected Adverse Reactions - Reports concerning reactions occurring outside Canada to a product with the same combination of active ingredients that is marketed in Canada - Market Authorization Holder reporting within 15 calendar days of receiving the information (expedited reporting) 1818Reporting to Canada Vigilance Adverse reaction reporting form - Available Regional/National Offices, MedEffect website, Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties (CPS) Submit by fax or mail On-Line Toll Free Telephone and Fax Verbal reports accepted Postage paid mailwww.healthcanada.gc.ca/medeffect www.santecanada.gc.ca/medeffetADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 10Public Health Prof. / Hospitals HC MAH with HC Public Warning Public Advisory (PA) Health Product Recall Notice Foreign Product Alert (FPA) Information Update It's Your Health (IYH) Fact Sheets and Backgrounders Health Canada Issued Health Professional Communication - Dear Health Care Professional Letter (HPC_DHCPL) Health Canada Issued Health Professional Communication -Notice to Hospitals (HPC-NtoH) Canadian Adverse Reaction Newsletter (CARN) Industry Issued Public Communication (MAH-PC) Industry Issued Health Professional Communication - Dear Health Care Professional Letter (HPC-DHCPL) Industry Issued Health Professional Communication - Notice to Hospitals (HPC-NtoH)Responsibility for IssuanceTarget AudienceRisk Communication Documents 20Moving from passive to proactive SUSTAINABILITYPost-market surveillance in Canada e.g. spontaneous AR reporting by health professionals and consumers;

Proposal: To define a framework for how to assess CBI in legislation. Safeguards: The framework would be consistent with the Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Pr operty Rights (TRIPS) Agreement and would respect Canada's obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA); other federal st atutes; and regulatory frameworks of other jurisdictions. Regulatory Amendments: For greater certainty, regulations will be used to define: the types of informa tion that are not considered to be CBI; when information ceases to be CBI; and, the timing and conditions under which such information might be disclosed. Defining Confidential Business Information (CBI)ChallengesADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 17 33Sharing information with other governments and organizations Issue: Health Canada has actively pursued strong partnerships with key regulatory counterparts to facilitat e information sharing on the safety and/or efficacy of health products , food and consumer products. Some countries are reluctant to exchange information with HC, including CBI, without specific legislative author ities and corresponding safeguards. Proposal: The Department is seeking an authority to enable the exchange of information with its regulatory counterparts in other jurisdictions. Safeguards: Information disclosure could be done through signed confidentiality agreements. Regulatory Amendments: The Department does not foresee the need for regulations with this proposal. Policy Instruments: Memorandum of UnderstandingChallenges 34Conclusions The shift from pre-market review to assessing and managing the risks and benefit s of products throughout their entire life-cycle is good for all stakeholders (MAH, Regulators and the consumer). Canada is moving forward to modernize and harmonize their Regulations to enable effective Drug Regulation and Pharmacovigilance in li ne with the best practices globally.ADVANCED WORKSHOP : REVIEW OF DRUG DEVELOPMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALSBANGKOK, 2-6 FEB 2009 APEC LSIF PROJECT \"Capacity Building For Drug Regulatory Ag encies on Clinical Trial and Good Clinical Practice (Phase 2)\" 18 35Thank You Thailand, APEC, ICH, Novartis Health Canada -Dr Agnes Klein -Heather Sutcliffe -Mike Ward "}
