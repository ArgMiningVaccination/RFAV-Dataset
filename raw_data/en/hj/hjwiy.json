{"title": "Small Fiber Neuropathy Associated With the Moderna SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine", "author": "Farzam Khokhar; Anum Khan; Zaid Hussain; Jianghong Yu; Anum A Khan", "url": null, "hostname": null, "description": "Efforts of controlling viral transmission began soon after the first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections were identified. Initial efforts were related to contact precautions, hand hygiene, and mask-wearing; however, it was soon evident that a robust global immunization drive was the most effective way to curb disease transmission. In the United States, the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines were rolled out soon after the FDA granted emergency use authorization for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine. What this also meant was that many of the routine phases that any new drug or vaccine goes through before being released publicly were bypassed. Over the past two years, various side effects and reactions have been seen after COVID-19 vaccine administration, the most common being local injection site events (e.g., pain, redness, swelling) and systemic effects (e.g., fatigue, headaches, myalgias). We report the case of a 64-year-old female who developed bilateral lower extremity numbness and tingling within weeks of receiving the third dose of Moderna SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. The patient underwent extensive testing to ascertain the diagnosis. She had negative autonomic testing and normal nerve conduction study/electromyography (EMG), which did not reveal large fiber neuropathy. Eventually, the patient underwent a skin biopsy, which revealed small fiber neuropathy. This case report highlights the importance of keeping a broad differential for rare side effects, such as small fiber neuropathy, that are currently being seen and reported in the literature.", "sitename": "Cureus", "date": "2022-06-15", "cleaned_text": "On May 25, 2018, the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) went into effect and changed how organizations deal with personal data of customers located in the EU.
