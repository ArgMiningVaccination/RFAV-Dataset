The debate is positioned as being rigidly proor anti-vax, without much wiggle room for flexibility in thinking. The pro-vaxers take the position that vaccines are completely safe and go as far as saying that if you are an anti-vaxer, it is because you are anti-government, anti-medicine, and anti-science1. In other words, you are a conspiracy theorist if you take an anti-vax position. While it is true that the anti-vax position does indeed question the vaccine establishment's position/policy, my experience is that it is less dogmatic than the pro-vax position23' with the exception of outliers who think that vaccines are the cause of autism and that adjustments promote immunity and reduce autism expression4. The pro-vax position presents a scenario that millions of people would be dying of infectious disease if it were not for vaccines. While this is an untrue statement, establishment authoritarians use that argument to shame people if they question the vaccine industrial complex. However, if we understand that vaccination is truly a big-business industrial complex, we can see why propaganda and shaming are required\u2014to keep the system going, which requires compliance and faith from the masses. Based on the last paragraph, it would be easy to see why I might be labeled as an anti-vaxer. However, I personally reject both of the pro-vax and anti-vax positions as they are currently framed because the data that informs my view of autism has nothing to do with vaccine propaganda or the rhetoric of the proand anti-vax factions. If you wish to free yourself horn the propaganda of the vaccine industrial complex, there is information that is disruptive to both the proor anti-vax viewpoints, and new information that can be used to rebuild one's perspective about vaccines. Disruptive Viewpoints CPC information that contradicts the establishment's view The vaccine industrial complex and pro-vaxers promote the notion that vaccines are the modern miracle that saved us all horn dying of an infectious disease. Pro-vaxers need to drop this argument; it is a complete loser position. Even the CDC presents evidence that contradicts this position. We know that the prevalence of infectious disease dropped substantially prior to 1960 before vaccines were introduced5 and death rates horn infectious disease in 1960, when there were no vaccines \"Pro-vaxers need to drop this argument; it is a complete loser position.\" except for polio, were the same as 19966. In other words, after 30 years of vaccinations, there was no change in the death rate horn infectious disease. Understanding the Temple Grandin story Watching the movie about Temple Grandin can be disruptive for anti-vaxers. She developed autism in 1950 at about age four, which is the typical age of expression. No vaccines were available at that time, so we know that vaccines are not the cause of autism. New Evidence to Rebuild a Rational View of Autism Expression The Perfect Storm was a movie about a nor'easter and a hurricane that combined to form a superstorm in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1991. Autism can be viewed as a superstorm (or super flame) that occurs in the brain of a child due to multiple smaller storms (flames). In the context of autism, it appeals that a genetic \"flame\" is required in addition to lifestyle \"flames,\" which then promotes the \"super flame\" of autism. Pre-Flame factor 1: Autism genes for enhanced inflam- mation It is known that there are genes associated with autism expression, most commonly in relation to enhanced neuronal/ glial and immune function7, which translates into a higher resting inflammatory state in the child. In other words, certain children are much more likely to express autism compared to others because they are genetically \"pre-flamed.\" Tests for identifying these children are not readily available. Pre-Flame factor 2: Environmental factors associated with enhanced inflammation It turns out that maternal inflammation increases the likelihood of autism expression in the child8. In other words, a \"flamed up\" mother will give birth to a \"pre-flamed\" child, and if this child is genetically predisposed with more \"flame,\" it is more likely to regress into the autistic spectrum, whether one is vaccinated or not. The overconsumption of refined sugar, flour, oils, and salt promotes the development of inflammatory states, such as obesity, diabetes, and autoimmunity9. When these conditions are present in a mother, it puts her offspring at a greater risk for autism expression8. If the infant is fed these same calories, the \"flame\" will \"turn on\" in the child, which typically manifests as dysbiosis, low omega-3 levels, and deficiencies in vitamin D and antioxidant nutrients, all of which are associated with autism expression81011. The perfect inflammation storm for autism appears to include \"flamey\" genes, which one cannot change, and two additional inflammation factors that can be modified, including a \"flamey\" mother and dietary \"flame\" promotion in the developing child. The best we way to \"deflame\" is to stay active, avoid stressors, get adequate sleep and eat an anti-inflammatory diet. Assuming a child has a normal lifestyle, the most important factor is diet. Can Vaccines Be a Trigger for Autism? Fever (inflammation) induction via vaccines, the flu, or an earache has been proposed as an acute trigger that can induce autism regression in those who are susceptible12. Based on the available evidence, it seems that for this to happen, the child must be in a \"pre-flamed\" state that is of an adequate magnitude to trigger the autistic regression. Dealing with the Vaccine Industrial Complex Going forward, we should all appreciate that the establishment's view is not going to change about vaccines. This should not come as a surprise because a bureaucratically driven big-business-associated industrial complex is not interested in a loss of economic activity and loss of confidence by product users. What allows any industrial complex to retain full power is compliance and faith from the masses, which can be achieved by creating conflict among the people; in this case, I am referring to the rigid proand anti-vax camps. While there are reasonable voices in each camp, what rises to the \"debate\" surface tends to be extremist in nature. It is possible that the information in this article will soften some of the extremists so that a more rational debate can emerge. In the meantime, the goal should be to get and keep the family in a \"deflamed\" state, which provides the best chance for reducing the expression of most diseases. Regarding the vaccine issue, for those with concerns, spreading out the schedule seems quite reasonable for those who plan to have their children vaccinated. References: 1. Perle SM.
