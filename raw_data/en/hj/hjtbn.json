Nurse anesthetists are also part of the anesthesia team, and work under the supervision of the attending anesthesiologist. Coverage is provided for all surgical subspecialties, labor and delivery, acute pain, hospital-wide airway management and resuscitations. Because of Level I Trauma Center certification, an anesthesiologist is on the premises 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Surgical cases are scheduled through the Operating Room Scheduling Office. Patients are usually seen by a member of the department on the day of surgery. If specific concerns need to be addressed on either Inpatient or Outpatient Surgery, the patient should be brought to the attention of the Charge Anesthesiologist who can be reached via the OR main desk at 254-5003. Arrangements can then be made for an Anesthesia consult, or call 952-967-7479 to make an appointment at the Hospitalist/Anesthesia Pre-Op Clinic. Patients scheduled for surgery during the off-shifts are booked through the Operating Room Charge Nurse. If a patient has unusual circumstances or special anesthetic needs (i.e., invasive monitoring, awake fiberoptic intubation, post-operative pain control, etc.) the in-house anesthesiologist should be contacted, and the request should be made directly to him or her. The Operating Room Charge Nurse can provide the proper telephone extension at the time of booking the surgery. Due to limitations of resources at this time, the Department of Anesthesiology only participates in formal resident education for the Department of Emergency Medicine, and the University Of Minnesota Department Of Anesthesia. 2012-2013 2 Department Descriptions CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL HEALTH LOCATION: 451 N.

Using \"queries\" the team may ask providers for cla rification about clinical documentation in charts related to under (and over) coding and around key quality measures. Additionally, CDMP staff may use Epic In-Basketing, text pages, e-mail, or in-perso n communication during interdisciplinary rounds to connect with providers. The compliant documentation specialists (CDSs) use a software package developed by J.A. Thomas and strong clinical experience to guide their work. CDMP concurrently follows all Medicare, most HealthPartners insurance, and many medical assistance patients on the medical and surgical units. CDMP does not review documentation of patients in the ED, Mental Health, Rehab, Labor & Delivery, or outpatients. KEY ROLES \u0098 Act as translators between Medicare/payer s documentation requirements and providers \u0098 Ensure accurate documentation will support reimbursement for the level of care provided \u0098 Ensure accurate documentation of patient acuity \u0098 Facilitate questions and proces ses between providers and coders \u0098 Active in education and preparation for ICD-10 conversion 2012-2013 6 Department DescriptionsUTILIZATION MANAGEMENT LOCATION Regions Hospital CONTACT PERSON Joshua Brewster, Director, Care Management 651-254-3780 Vicki Anderson, Supervisor of UM 651-254-2826 Sue Gruenewald, UM Coordinator 651-254-2948 Kim Short, UM Coordinator 651-254-2259 DESCRIPTION OF DEPARTMENT The Utilization Management Program group utilization review experts who evaluate the appropriateness of admission, including medical necessity, continued stay, discharge practices, use of medical and hospital services, and all related factors which may contribute to the effective utilization of hospital resources and physician services. Using InterQual criteria, the team re views all admissions and hosp ital stays; as necessary they communicate with payers to ensure reimbursement. UM staff are part of interdisciplinary, team rounds on medical and surgical units to answer questi ons and to facilitate timely discharges. PURPOSE \u0098 Admission review is conducted the within one busine ss day of admission by the UM staff. The purpose is twofold: 1. To determine the appropriateness of an inpati ent admission. Using the Severity of Illness (SI) indicators as the guide for the review should establish the medical necessity of admissions to the Acute Care Setting. 2. To obtain payer certification as required by contract agreements. \u0098 Concurrent review: 1. The purpose of this review is to assess period ically the patient's need for continued treatment, using the aforementioned criteria, or standards of care. Intensity of Service (IS) indicators are used as the guide. 2. To obtain payer certification throughout the hospital stay. PROCESS \u0098 Admission review and continued stay review: o The UM staff matches documentation of the patient's problem and physician's plan with the InterQual Acute Care Criteria. Staff notes the criteria met on the review and will review the record again concurrently. o If there is not adequate documentation to me et the medical necessity criteria for and/or continued stay, the UM staff contacts the attending MD. \u0098 Third party payer denials are individually managed based on the contract requirements. \u0098 Physician Peer Review: o Upon request of the UM staff, a physician reviewer will conduct a review by the end of the same day and document the findings. He/she will also contact the attending physician to discuss the case and plan of care. o If the physician reviewer is not available, or cannot concur with the attending provider, the case will be referred to the VP of Medical Affairs who will then review the case and contact the attending physician. o In cases of continued disagreement, the case will be referred to the Quality Peer Committee for a final decision. The attending physician will be contacted. 2012-2013 7 Department DescriptionsEMERGENCY MEDICINE LOCATION 2nd Floor, Central Section, Room C2587 DEPT PHONE 651-254-4788 Regions Hospital CONTACTS Pat Anderson, Residency Coordinator 651-254-5091 Lori Barrett, EM Residency Manager 651-254-3666 Zabrina Evens, MD Chief Resident 651-629-2412 Joe Walter, MD Chief Resident 651-629-3035 Wendy Woster, MD Chief Resident 651-629-3040 Matt Morgan, MD, Rotation Director 651-254-5298 HOURS 24 Hours Per Day, 7 Days Per Week FACULTY Kurt M.

Varecka, MD Gillette Children's Specialty Healthcare Deb Bohn, MD Ann MD Tria Orthopaedic Center Deb Bohn, MD Yvonne Grierson, MD DESCRIPTION OF DEPARTMENT/SERVICE The Hand Surgery Fellowship Program began in 1991 as a collaboration between Dr. James H. House at the University of Minnesota, Dr. Edward C. McElfresh at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and Dr. Matthew D. Putnam at Park Nicollet Medical Center and the University of Minnesota. Dr. Loree K. Kalliainen assumed the role of Program Director in 2009 as Dr. Putnam pursued other challenges at the University. In 2010, the program funding lines were moved to the HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education at Regions Hospital. The fellowship is ACGME certified, and fellows enter through the NRMP match program. The primary faculty within the Hand Surgery Fellowship Program are from both orthopaedic and plastic surgery backgrounds. Points of pride of the faculty are the Twin Cities-wide breadth of the fellowship and the collegiality between surgeons. All forms of practice are encountered by our fellows, allowing them to choose the optimal career path for themselves. The hand surgery fellows take night call at Regions Hospital, a Level I Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center. They work with all Plastic and Hand faculty and participate in the education of Plastic Surgery residents and of interns rotating on the Plastic and Hand service. The surgical and clinical experiences cover the spectrum of hand and microsurgery, and the interested fellow also has the opportunity to participate in the care of patients with elbow and shoulder disease. Orthopaedic oncology exposure is available at the University. Acute and subacute trauma are primarily seen at Regions and HCMC. Elective surgery is performed at Regions and Tria. Pediatric cases are seen at Gillette, Tria, and Regions. 2012-2013 17 Department DescriptionsHand Surgery Fellowship (continued) Our Hand Fellowship Program has been highly competitive since its inception, and our fellows have gone on to practice hand surgery in academic and priv ate-practice settings in the United States and in England and Lebanon. Regions Hand Conference is on the second & fourth Wednesdays of the month. At 7:00 am on the first and third Thursdays of the month, there is a Hand Conference at the University. Both conferences cover selected patient cases, didactics, and journal club. Fellows are expected to work with Dr. Julie Adams at the University and Dr. James Fletcher at Regions to coordinate conferences. Anatomic dissections take place at the Unive rsity on an approximately quarterly basis. Didactics relevant to the upper extremity are also offered at Tria. The hand fellows participate in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery's annual Competency Assessment and James House Visiting Lectureship Day. Each fellow must perform a QI and/or a research project each year. Limited funds are available for research support. Fellows are funded to attend a national meeting and an instructional course. Most fellows have chosen a week-long microsurgery course, but if the fellow has had adequate exposure to and experience in microsurgery, another course may be requested. The Plastic & Hand Surgery and Orthopaedic offices at Regions Hospital are located on the 2nd floor of the North Building N273 off of the North Building elevator. The specific daily schedules of the attendings, clinics and OR schedules can be obtained from LuAnn Zeilinger (651-254-3792) for Drs. Schubert and Tuttle, Mann, Lacey (651-254-4870) for Drs.

Principal Diagnosis : is designated and defined as the condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for occasioning the admission of the patient to the hospital for care. Other Diagnoses : are designated and defined as all conditions that coexist at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received and/or the length of stay. Diagnoses that relate to an earlier episode which have no bearing on the current hospital stay are to be excluded. Procedure and Date : All significant procedures are to be reported. A significant procedure is one that is: surgical in nature, or carries a procedural risk, or carries an anesthetic risk, or requires specialized training. For significant procedures, the identity of the person performing the procedure and the date must be reported. Principal Procedure : is one that was performed for definitive treatment rather than one performed for diagnostic or exploratory purposes, or was necessary to take care of a complication. If there are two procedures that are principal, then the one most related to the principal diagnosis should be selected as the principal procedure. Surgery : includes incision, excision, amputation, introduction, endoscopy, repair, destruction, suture and manipulation. Procedural Risk : This term refers to professionally recognized risk that a procedure may induce some functional impairment, injury, morbidity, or even death. This risk may arise from indirect trauma, physiologic disturbances, interference with natural defense mechanisms, or exposure of the body to infection or other harmful agents. Traumatic Procedures : are those that are invasive, including non-surgical procedures that utilize cut downs, that cause tissue damage (e.g. irradiation) or introduce some toxic or noxious substance (e.g. caustic test). Physiologic Risk : is associated with the use of virtually any pharmacological or physical agent that can affect homeostasis (e.g. those that alter fluid distribution, electrolyte balance, blood pressure levels, and stress or tolerance tests). 2012-2013 26 Department DescriptionsHealth Information Management /continued Any procedure in which it is obligatory (or usual) to utilize pre-or post-medications that are associated with physiologic or pharmacological risk should be considered as having a \"procedural risk\", for example,those that require heavy sedation or drugs selected for systemic effects used as alteration of metabolism,blood pressure or cardiac function. Some of the procedures include harmful exposure risk to other persons as well as to the patient, thus, these requiring special precautionary measures. Anesthetic Risk: Any procedure that either requires or is regularly performed under general anesthesia carries anesthetic risk, as do procedures under local, regional, or other forms of anesthesia that induce sufficient functional impairment necessitating special precautions to protect the patient from harm. Specialized Training: This criterion is important for procedures that are exclusively or appropriately performed by specialized professionals, qualified technicians, or clinical teams that are either specifically trained for this purpose or whose services are principally dedicated to carrying them out. Whenever specially trained staff resources are necessary or any customarily employed in the performance of a procedure, it is considered significant. BYLAWS: Time schedule of record completion: x All medical records must be completed within 29 days of discharge. x All final diagnoses and procedures shall be completed using UHDDS definitions. Progress Notes: x Progress notes must be documented at least daily on all patients in the intensive, cardiac and special care units. x All acute care areas should have progress notes documented at least five (5) times weekly. x Areas such as Rehabilitation, Alcohol & Drug Abuse, or Psychiatry approximately every other day. 2012-2013 27 Department Descriptions DICTAPHONE DICTATION GUIDE HEALTHPARTNERS FAMILY OF CARE HEALTHPARTNERS REGIONS HOSPITAL HUDSON HOSPITAL WESTFIELDS HOSPITAL AMERY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER LAKEVIEW HOSPITAL DICTATION INSTRUCTIONS: Dial (715-531-6240 for Hudson, 715-243-2605 for Westfields, 715-268-0101 for Amery/Luck) 2.

PURPOSE To ensure accurate clinical documentation in all clinical information systems (paper or electronic) II. POLICY In order to ensure accurate clinical documentation in all clinical information systems (paper or electronic), any revisions to dictated clinical documentation must be captured in the electronic systems. Whenever possible, revisions are made in the electronic system in which the document originated (i.e., Dictaphone Text, Co-Path, Chartscript, IDX, etc). Revisions to transcribed documents should be made at the time of electronic signature in Epic. If the original document is no longer retained in that system, then a new addendum document must be created. If the originating system does not provide a mechanism for revisions, the revisions will be made in the receiving system(s). A copy of the revised documentation must be interfaced to or scanned by all receiving electronic systems and/or filed in the paper-based medical record (per established protocols). The original, unaltered document must remain as part of the electronic patient record, and the patient record must permit access to the original document on demand. Revisions are made in the format of either edits within the original document or addenda to the original document, and must change the content of the documentation. Revisions of documents for non-substantive changes (e.g. typos) is costly, and considered unnecessary rework. III. PROCEDURE(S) Dictating Edits or Addenda in the Regions Dictaphone Text System: Edits are used to correct unsigned documents <=30 days from date of service or discharge; addenda are used to correct signed documents and documents >30 days from date of service or discharge. Addenda are done as separate reports because of electronic signature in Epic. Dial dictation system (254-5454) Enter 4-digit dictator ID, 2-digit worktype, and 13-digit encounter number, as prompted. Begin dictating as follows: \"The following dictation is an (edit or addendum) to document ID # (found at bottom of transcribed report), patient name and patient MRN\" 2012-2013 40 Department DescriptionsDictating Corrections to Administrative Errors: Dictate an addendum to correct an erroneously placed document in the patient's chart. Dial dictation system (254.5454) Enter 4-digit dictator ID, 2-digit worktype, and 13-digit encounter number, as prompted. Begin dictating as follows: \"The following dictation is an addendum to document ID # (found at bottom of transcribed report), patient name and patient MRN. This document was erroneously placed in the patient's chart (due to dictation, interface, transcription error, if known), and should no longer be used for patient care.\" If known, provide the transcriptionist with the correct date of service, patient name and patient MRN for the document.

Additionally, consultative services ar e provided for other health care facilities, home care agencies, EMS providers, local corporations, state and local government agencies and community organizations. The Infection Prevention & Control program is a multidisciplin ary, systematic approach to quality patient care that emphasizes risk reduction of infectious disease transm ission in a health care environment by using sound epidemiological principles and evidence-based methodol ogies. The IP&C program for staff and patients is supported by Employee Health and Wellness, Perf ormance Improvement, Data and Measurement, Risk Management, and Safety departments at Regions Hospital. Objectives: x Prevent infectious disease transmission within Regi ons Hospital as well as the public health community. x Recommend methods for early identification and appropriate therapy of infectious agents x Analyze practices that have potential to affect rates of healthcare associated infections x Provide Infection Control education and training to employees, medical staff, and professional staff x Comply with reporting requirements to local, state and federal public health agencies. x Facilitate compliance with accrediting organization standards and guidelines. Goal: To provide health care workers with the knowledge and su pport to minimize occupational hazards and prevent the transmission of infectious organisms; and to continue to measure, assess and reduce the infectious complications of patients and staff Resident Role and Responsibilities A. Know and Comply with Infection Prevention Bundles. A bundle is a group of evidence based interventions that have been shown to reduce infection rates. Bundles are part of a monthly audit and reported publically to the Mi nnesota Hospital Association. Prevent Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) infections 1. Active screening of MRSA on admission to the ICU's 2. Contact Isolation and use of dedicated equipment 3. Hand Hygiene compliance 4. Decontamination of th e environment and equipment 5. Decolonization of carriers Catheter Related Blood Stream Infection (CLABSI) Bundle 1. Hand hygiene before insertion, en tering line, or dressing changes 2. Maximal barrier precau tions during insertion 3. Chlorhexidine skin antisepsis for site prep and care 4. Appropriate catheter site* and administration care 5. No routine replacement *NOTE: Select the catheter, insertion technique, and in sertion site with the lowest risk for complications. Subclavian site is preferred unless medically contraindicated. Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) Bundle 1. Elevate head of bed to at least 30 degrees 2. Daily sedation \"vacations.\" (Reduction of sedation acceptable) 3. Daily assessment of readiness to extubate. 4. Peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis. 5. Deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Surgical Site Infection (SSI) Bundle INFECTION PREVENTION & CONTROL LOCATION Regions Hospital 1st Floor, North Building, Suite 1020 Dept. Phone 651 254-3489 Clinical Pager 651 629-0556 2012-2013 67 Department Descriptions 1. Appropriate prophylactic antibiotic within 30-60 minutes of incision; discontinued 24 hours post surgery 2. Appropriate hair removal via clipping (No shaving) 3. Peri-operative glucose control 4. Urinary catheter removed within 48 hours B. Hand Hygiene before and after all patient care contacts. C. Culturing guidelines x Order cultures when a new healthcare acquired infection is suspected x Order cultures prior to starting antibiotics x Follow culture results to compare antibiotic sensitivity to current antibiotics prescribed x Consult with infection preventionists on questi ons about isolation precautions or exposures x Consult with ID physicians as needed; i.e., for patie nts with infections caused by multi-drug resistant organisms, highly contagious or unusual infectious diseases. D. It is mandatory to order an Infect ious Disease physician consultation when a patient: 1. Is going home on IV antibiotic therapy 2. Has fungemia (a positive blood culture caused by a fungal agent) 3. Is receiving four (4) or more antibiotics Multi-Drug Resistant Organism (MDRO) Isolation Protocol Patients with a known history of MRSA, VRE, C. di ff, ESBL, Acinetobacter baumanii, Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia, and CRE are identified in the electronic medi cal record (EPIC). Infection Control makes entries based on the current patient surveillance cult ures and removes a patient from this sy stem if they are no longer colonized with these specific antibiotic resistant organisms. Upon admission patients with a history of MRSA are placed in contact isolation. In order to remove a patient from isolation they must have NONE of the following risk fa ctors; Reside in a Nursing Home or LTAC, open draining wounds, long term lines and tubes, receive dialysis, or on antibiotics to treat MRSA. They will then need two sets of negative surveillance cultures obtained at least one week apart. Patients with a history of VRE are kept in contact isolation for the duration of hospitalization. Patien ts with Clostridium difficile di arrhea are placed in Enteric isolation until the patient no longer has diarrhea. Rooms are cleaned with Bleach at discharge. See Regions Hospital In fection Control policies: 50:14 Contact Isolation Precautions 50:46 Methicillin Resistant Multi Drug difficile 50:96 Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus 20:15 TB Exposure Control Plan Regions Hospital uses the Centers for Disease Control/Heal thcare Infection Control Policy Advisory Committee (CDC/HICPAC) guidelines for isolation. See Guidelines to Isolation Precautions for Communicable Diseases IC Policy IC: 60:01. STANDARD PRECAUTIONS (SP) Standard Precautions are the primary strategy to reduce hosp ital acquired infections (HAI). SP are to be used for all patients and every procedure regardless of diagnosis, known or presumed infection status. This includes Hand Hygiene before and after patient contact. Perform Hand Hygiene after removing gloves. Standard Precautions incorporate the applications of both Universal Precautions (designed to reduce the risk of transmission of bloodborne pathogen s) and Universal Body Substance Isolation (designed to reduce the transmission of pathogens from moist body substances and non-intact skin). TRANSMISSION-BASED ISOLATION PRECAUTIONS x Airborne x Contact x Droplet x Enteric x Neutropenic x Special Respiratory 2012-2013 68 Department Descriptions NEUTROPENIC PRECAUTIONS (in addition to Standard Precautions for Infection Control) Private Room Good Hand Hygiene Masks VISITORS: Must be instructed by the patient's nurse before entering the room. Visiting Restrictions Plants/ Flowers Required. Room doors are to remain closed. Required to enter room. Use an antimicrobial product. The patient will wear a surgical or N95 mask (as ordered by MD) when leaving the room . Persons with FEVER, COUGH, OR signs of respiratory or other acute illness should not have contact with this patient. If contact is critical for the care of the patient a mask is required for entry. Plants and fresh flowers are not allowed in the patient room. See Infection Control and Oncology Policies for further information. Infection Control (continued AIRBORNE IMMUNITY TO THE SPECIFIC DISEASE IS REQUIRED WHEN ENTERING THE AIRBORNE ISOLATION ROOM I.E. MEASLES and CHICKENPOX Use Airborne Precautions for patients know n or suspected to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by airborne drople t nuclei (small-particle residue [5 um or smaller in size] of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air and that can be dispersed widely by air currents within a room or over a long distance). Examples: Measles, Chickenpox. HAND HYGIENE IS REQUIRED AFTER LEAVING ROOM. CONTACT GLOVES AND A GOWN ARE REQUIRED WHEN ENTERING A PATIENT'S ROOM Use Contact Precautions for specified patients known or suspected to be infected or colonized with epidemiologically important mi croorganisms that can be transmitted by direct contact with the patient or indirect cont act by touching the surfaces or patient-care items in the patient's environment. Examples: Lice, Respirat ory Syncytial Virus, Methicillin-resistant Staph Aureus (MRSA). HAND HYGIENE IS REQUIRED AFTER LEAVING THE PATIENT'S ROOM AFTER REMOVING GLOVES. DROPLET WEAR A BLUE SURGICAL MASK WITH EYE PROTECTION WITHIN 5 FEET OF A PATIENT. Use Droplet Precautions for a patient known or suspected to be infected with microorganisms transmitted by droplets (large-particle droplets larger than 5 um in size. Transmission requires close co ntact since large droplets do not remain suspended in the air and generally travel only short distances (3-5 feet). Examples: Pertussis, Mumps, Meningitis. HAND HYGIENE IS REQUIRED AFTER LEAVING THE ROOM. ENTERIC Post for patients with Clostridium difficile diarrhea. USE CIDASTAT ANTIMICROBIAL HANDWASHING SOAP, RATHER THAN ALCOHOL-BASED HAND RUBS, AFTER DIRECT PATIENT CARE OR CONTACT WITH PATIENT CARE ENVIRONMENT TO REMOVE FECAL CONTAMINATION AND THESE SPORE- FORMING BACTERIA. NEUTROPENIC POSITIVE AIRFLOW ROOM REQUIRED. Protective measures are used to heighten awareness for patients determined to have a more severe and longer duration of immuno -suppression, which places them at greater risk for infection from both endogenous and exogenous sources. Oncology staff determines which patients require Neutropenic precautions and the duration they are to remain in effect.

Fellows will attend core lectures and phar macology lectures throughout the program and discuss basic toxicology concepts in the clinical settings 3. A monthly research conference and weekly jo urnal club will introduce and review research methodology and train fellows to critically analyze the available medical literature. 4. Fellows will evaluate environmental exposure issues and learn to identify hazardous materials and manage environmental exposures and contaminations rotations in the OEM clinic and Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 5. The Program provides opportunities for fellows to become familiar with intervention techniques to prevent poisoning both in the community and in occupational settings. 6. Fellows will become familiar with laboratory techniques in toxicology during their clinical rotations and during an optional one-month Fo rensic Toxicology/ Medical Examiner rotation 7. Fellows will provide medical back up for Pois on Center calls throughout their fellowship and spend 3 months at the Poison Center. Fellows will become familiar with administrative skills as necessary for directorship of a regional poison control center and the role of regulation and legislation in poison prevention. 8. The Program provides a rich opportunity for fellows to learn and apply effective teaching techniques, and effective skills for oral and written communication and effective teaching techniques through presenting case conferences, lectures, ground rounds Supervision Fellows will be supervised by the Toxicology Faculty in conjunction with designated rotation attendings. Other Resources Consultation from specialty consultants related to toxicology (mycology, herpetology, botany, HazMat, etc.) is available and is obtained when appropriat e, and provides immediate feedback on patient problems. Follow-up of admitted patients is at the discretion of each fellow physician and provides valuable information on clinical course and outcomes . A quality improvement program is in place and, when appropriate, the fellow is included in this process. Evaluation Fellows are informally evaluated during their rotations.

Current P&T Committee Chair: Services (continued) Stewardship of our antibiotic resources is becoming incr easingly important with the evolution of multiple drug resistant pathogens and a limited number of novel antibi otics available both now and in the future. Use of antibiotics in specific patients or patter ns of antibiotic utilization in the medical center all have an effect on resident bacterial flora and their susceptibility to individual an tibiotics or an entire chemical class of drugs. Misuse and under-dosing of antibiotics have been sh own to drive bacterial resistance; a phenomenon often termed collateral damage. At the same time a delay of appropriate initial antibiotic therapy has been shown to contribute to patient mortality. Patient exposure to appropriate or inap propriate antibiotic therapy carries the risk of adverse drug reactions. For these reasons, antibiotic stewardship is a responsibility of all healthcare professionals and the governing structure of the Hospital. Our goal in treating bacterial infections is an optimal clinical outcom e without antibiotic induced side effects. In January of 2007 the Infectious Disease Society of Am erica published a position paper on antibiotic stewardship which will likely in the future be incorporat ed into the hospital accreditation process. For the last ten years, Regions has maintained a program th at links measures of antibiotic utilization with changes in bacterial resistance patterns. These initial efforts were multidisciplinary including an infectious diseases physician, an infectious diseases trained pharmacist, an d a microbiologist. This program was sanctioned by the P&T Committee with the approval of hospital administrati on, the pharmacy director, the patient care committee, and medical executive committee. The P&T Committee also created an antibiotic subcommittee. Goals of Antibiotic Stewardship 1. Optimize the utilization of antibiotics within Hospital. 2. Reduce antibiotic adverse drug events, drug-drug, drug-food interactions, & promote appropriate dosing that optimize appropriate pharmacodynamic outcome parameters. 3. Limit growth in bacterial resistance or collateral damage. 4. Optimize parenteral to oral conversion of antibiotics 5. Use the optimal route and method of antibiotic administration 6. Duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by patient response. 7. Reduce overall cost and utilization of antibiotic therapy 8. Create a seamless process for practitioners. Tenants of Antibiotic Stewardship 1. Obtain appropriate cultures or diagnostic tests apriori 2. Direct antibiotic against intended bacterial pathogens 3. Do not delay antibiotic therapy 4. Make sure your initial antibiotic/s cover/s likely bacterial pathogens. 5. Dose your antibiotic for maximal performance. 6. Streamline your antibiotic therapy once culture and susceptibility data become available. Avoid unnecessary duplication of antibiotic therapy. 7. Limit the duration of antibiotic th erapy to treat the specific problem. 2012-2013 96 Department Descriptions Outpatient Pharmacy To: Regions Hospital Residents From: Julie Vollmer, Outpatient Pharmacy Manager Date: March 2012 Re: Outpatient Pharmacy Services Regions Outpatient Pharmacy operates under Federal Regulation 340B which restricts prescription service to \"Regions qualified patients.\" Service provided to the following: x Regions Hospital discharged patients x Regions Hospital ED patients x Regions Hospital owned clinic patients, and x Regions Hospital employees.

Angiography/Interventional Radiology: Phone 651-254-9400; Fax 651-254-2390. 3. Central Scheduling (7:30 6:00 Fax 651-254-2379. Fluoroscopy, Room: Phone 651-254-3794; Fax 651-254-5705. B. SCHEDULING OF EXAMINATIONS 1. Required Information x An order is required for all exams performed. Ordering is done through EPIC, the electronic medical record. x All orders must include: Name of exam, indi cation or symptoms and the ordering physician beeper number. Radiologic services are available 24 hours per da y, seven days per week. In order to serve you better, appropriate clinical information is essentia l to both interpretation and performance of the correct procedure. Please do not he sitate to get in touch directly with one of the radiologists if you have a question or problem. The radiologists, in turn, may wish to directly convey a result to you, or seek your approval to proceed with furt her diagnostic procedures. Including your beeper number and/or telephone number where you ca n be reached will expedite your patient's procedure in the Radiology Department. 2. Routine Requests x The routine workday for examinations is 7:00 AM to 4:30 PM. We would prefer to perform non- emergent exams during this time period; however, examinations outside of these hours will also be performed without hesitation if you deem ne cessary. Feeding tube placements will not be performed routinely after 5:00 PM. 2012-2013 100 Department DescriptionsRadiology (continued) x CT, general diagnostic imaging (x-ray), and US are staffed 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Examinations may be scheduled at any time. 3. \"STAT\" Requests x Because of the nature of this Hospital, there are frequently several simultaneous requests for immediate examinations. We may ask why the exam ination is STAT in order to set priorities. Films to check chest tube placement and exclud e pneumothorax are generally not considered emergent, but will usually be performed within 30 minutes. 4. Portable Examinations x Radiographs should be obtained portably in the patient's room when there would be difficulty transporting the patient to the Radiology Departme nt. Such patients are those on ventilators or cardiac monitoring. They generally do not include pa tients with IV's, NG tubes, or multiple chest tubes, if such are attachable to transport carts. The quality of the portable exam is less, generally has more radiation, and costs more than a more definitive examination done in the Radiology Department. 5. Emergency Procedures x Radiologic consultation is ava ilable 24 hours per day. To discuss or schedule an emergency procedure, contact the Radiology Front Desk at 65 1-254-3766. There is a staff radiologist in the Hospital 24 hours per day. Please do not hesitate to contact us. 6. Protective Measures for the Radiologic Technologist x Because of their repeated exposure to radiation, Radiologic Technologists are not to hold the patient in position for the radiographic examination. If the patient cannot maintain the position for the examination requested by the clinician, the examination will be changed to one which the patient can tolerate or other means of support and/or restraint will be used. C. LOCATION OF FILMS Films are available in the PACs (Picture Archiving Computer System) and viewed through the Web Browser (a desktop icon on many computers) or EPIC Imaging Link (viewable through any computer on which you can access EPIC - the electronic medical record) There are also PACS view stations in many clinics and in the Emergency Department and several inpatient units. D. RADIOLOGY CONSULTATION AND CONFERENCES The Radiology Department is available for consultation 24 hours per day. In addition, participation in several specialty conferences occurs during each wee k and month. If you have a special request, please contact us. E. RELEASE OF PATIENT INFORMATION For the protection of the patient and ourselves, we mu st have a release of information statement signed by the patient or his or her legal guardian for all radiographs , CD's and/or reports to be sent out or taken from the Hospital. The original films are the property of Reg ions Hospital and are the legal responsibility of this Hospital. If a patient is transferred from Regions Hospital to another hospital by ambulance, the images will be copied on a CD and sent with the patient if a release of information form has been signed and left with the Radiology Department. We are able to deliver films to any local hospital or doctor's office by means of the Hospital delivery service, within a few hours after re ceiving a request for such transfer. Such requests should be directed to the Radiology File Room. Films made here after 4:00 PM can be delivered by the following weekday morning after 8:30 AM. If there are any questions about release of films and/or reports, please call or see the Radiology File Room at 651-254-3794. 2012-2013 101 Department DescriptionsRadiology (continued) F.

If you are trying to reach the assigned CM/SW please see AMION for contact information. DESCRIPTION OF DEPARTMENT The Care Management's licensed social workers and registered nurse case managers are assigned to all inpatient medical and surgical units. Most units have a dyad/triad team of a social worker(s) and case manager(s) who collaborate to facilitate the progression of care, to coordinate discharge-planning needs, and to address psychosocial needs or barriers patient may have. Patients, families, health care providers and/or other concerned persons may request Care Management services . Hospital staff may make a referral via telephone, physician/nursing orders, or call the social worker and/or case manager directly. CONTINUING CARE PLANNING Contact the assigned social worker or case manager when it is determined that a patient may need supportive services in the community. The Care Management staf f is knowledgeable about both local and out-of-area resources to best meet the needs of the patients/families. In many cases, either the case manager or the social worker can handle discharge needs of a patient. However, the team discusses the cases and determines whether so cial work or case management intervention is more appropriate. In some cases, the team works togeth er to best meet the needs of the patient/family. PSYCHOSOCIAL ASSESSMENT Following referral, the social worker will meet with th e patient and family to assess psychosocial needs and develop a plan and/or recommendations to address the needs. The social worker will also consult with the referring person and will participate in the interdisciplin ary patient care planning process. The social worker will work with the interdisciplinary team and the patient/fami ly to accomplish agreed upon goals for discharge. PROGRESSION OF CARE The case manager is the main contact and facilitator of patient care, including progression of care and discharge planning.

Antony Skaria, Catholic priests DESCRIPTION OF DEPARTMENT/SERVICE Chaplains at Regions Hospital are available to provide spiritual and emotional support to patients, families, and staff. Chaplains work with patients and families to help them find meaning in the midst of illness, hospitalization, and treatment. The purpose of the Chaplaincy Department is to support the hospital's commitment to holistic care by: x Providing spiritual care with compassion and respect; x Honoring the importance of spirituality and religious beliefs in health and healing; x Promoting the integration of spiritual care into the total patient care program; x Contributing to a healing environment within the hospital. Hospital staff are encouraged to contact a chaplain whenever support for patients and family members might be helpful, especially in response to changes in medical condition, life-limiting diagnosis, death of a patient, Code 2, significant personal loss, or other crises which can raise spiritual and emotional concerns. Chaplains serve as members of the interdisciplinary health care team. Each nursing station has a staff member assigned as the primary chaplain. As their schedules permit, chaplains attend team rounds and care conferences. They provide another perspective on the care of the patient and family. As non-medical personnel chaplains can serve as a bridge between staff, patients, and families. Chaplains are available as consultants and educators in the areas of spirituality, religious customs, and belief systems. Chaplains are among those staff members who serve as consultants for the Regions Ethics Consult team. A number of our chaplains are trained, experienced Critical Incident Stress Debriefing facilitators and are available to lead debriefing sessions for hospital staff after particularly difficult, stressful cases. Ongoing ministry provided includes: supportive visits through request, referral, and daily rounds; consultation with staff; worship opportunities and provision of sacraments; referrals as needed to community religious and spiritual resources. Worship is conducted in the Chapel of the Divine Healer located near the west entrance of the hospital. Services include daily Roman Catholic Mass, Friday Muslim prayer, Wednesday afternoon prayer service, Memorial Services, and special services. Staff chaplains are Board Certified through the Association of Professional Chaplains.

Once the IME DIO and GMEC determine that the sponsoring institution can no longer provide an adequate educational experience for its residents, the sponsoring institution will, to the best of its ability, arrange for the temporary transfer of the residents to programs at other sponsoring institutions until such time as the Institute for Medical Education is able to resume providing the experience. The IME DIO will communicate with the offices of GME and Medical Staff Services at Regions Hospital to coordinate any issues regarding the temporary transfer, credentialing, relocation and housing of our residents. Residents who transfer to other programs as a result of a disaster will be provided by their Program Director(s) with an estimated time that relocation to another program will be necessary. Should that initial time estimate need to be extended, the resident will be notified by their Program Director(s) using written or electronic means identifying the estimated time of the extension. If the disaster prevents the sponsoring institution from re-establishing an adequate educational experience within a reasonable amount of time following the disaster, then permanent transfers will be arranged. The IME DIO will be the primary institutional contact with the ACGME and the Institutional Review Committee Executive Director regarding disaster plan implementation and needs within the sponsoring institution. In the event of a disaster affecting other sponsoring institutions of graduate medical education programs, the IME DIO will work collaboratively with the DIO of the affected sponsoring institution to accept transfer residents from other institutions. This will include the process to request complement increases from the ACGME as may be required for accepting additional residents for training. Programs currently under a proposed or actual adverse accreditation decision by the ACGME will not be eligible to participate in accepting transfer residents. Programs will be responsible for establishing procedures to protect the academic and personnel files of all residents from loss or destruction by disaster. This should include at least a plan for storage of data in a separate geographic location away from the sponsoring institution. ###2012-2013 127 IME/GME PoliciesSubject DUPLICATION AND ATTESTATION OF CERTIFICATES Attachments No Key words Attestation, Completion, Certificate, Duplication Number IME-24 Category Business Practices (BP) Effective Date April 15, 2003 Manual Graduate Medical Education Last Review Date May 17, 2011 Issued By Graduate Medical Education Next Review Date May 2013 Origination Date April 15, 2003 Applicable This policy will apply to all training programs with residents rotating at Regions Hospital.

Retired Date Not Applicable Review Responsibility Graduate Medical Education Committee Contact: Graduate Medical Education This policy will apply to all rotations away from HealthPartners Clinics and Regions Hospital, including \"month-out\" experiences. BACKGROUND Historically some residents in HealthPartners Institute for Medical Education (IME) programs have taken an elective \"month-out\" rotation for an enriched educational experience. The benefits of such, national or international, elective rotations have been recognized as they afford the resident exposure to a particular patient population to which they would otherwise be unexposed. Examples of such rotations include a month long experience at a toxicology referral center for in-depth study of pesticide and organophosphate poisoning for a resident training in emergency medicine; or a month long experience at a tropical hospital for study of tropical diseases for a family practice resident interested in travel medicine. Additionally, it is sometimes necessary to have IME residents participate in an \"off-site\" rotation at a local hospital, clinic or other facility for a special educational experience that meets specialty-specific educational criteria. Examples of such \"off-site\" rotations include a three-day rotation at an industrial manufacturing company for a resident training in occupational medicine, or a one-day-a-week psychiatry rotation at a specialized mental health treatment center, lasting three months. Recognizing the need for the above-mentioned unique educational experiences, IME is desirous of maximizing opportunities for our resident physicians. However, because of the current financial climate of increased federal regulations and limited resources, it is necessary that residents on any \"off-site\" rotations (domestic or foreign) be eligible for federal funding, OR that they have an alternate source of funding for their salary and benefits. 2012-2013 164 IME/GME PoliciesPURPOSE To maximize quality learning opportunities for our resident physicians while ensuring that all regulatory, curricular and institutional requirements for accreditation and for fiscal responsibility are met. DEFINITIONS 1) Provider = hospital or hospital=based clinic (regardless of location, domestic or foreign, and regardless of whether or not the hospital accepts Medicare patients); 2) Non-provider = any facility other than a hospital [i.e. a clinic, an institution, a corporation (3M, General Mills etc.) that is NOT hospital-based]. 3) Sponsoring Institution = Regions Hospital/HealthPartners IME. 4) Participating Institution = an entity other than Regions serving as a site for resident education. 5) Non-provider site resident training agreement = an agreement between Regions and a non- provider site. The non-provider site resident training agreement protects the resident from misunderstandings regarding malpractice, clinical responsibilities and educational performance. Such agreement may include any teaching cost required by the non-provider. 6) Provider site resident training agreement = a contract between Regions and a \"provider\" site whereby all details are covered PLUS, it involves an exchange of dollars by way of reimbursing the hospital (Regions) for the intern and/or resident salary and benefit costs. POLICY 1 Off-site rotations are to be held: a) at a \"non-provider\" site (regardless if domestic or foreign), PROVIDED an appropriate non- provider site resident training agreement is in place covering all the five requisite ACGME points 2, OR b) at a United States \"provider\" site PROVIDED an appropriate provider site resident training agreement is in place acknowledging that the provider site will claim the resident for Medicare reimbursement, and that the sponsoring institution (Regions) will be reimbursed for the resident's salary and benefits for that specific rotation. 3 PROCEDURES 1) A resident interested in an \"off-site\" elective rotation must notify their program director no later than 120 days prior to the start date of the proposed rotation. 1 This policy is applicable to resident physicians only. Faculty members interested in accompanying residents on a foreign \"mon th- out\" rotation need to negotiate those arrangements with their department chair and HealthPartners Medical Group (HPMG). 2 See Appendix \"A\" excerpted from rough I.C.3, [Effective July 1, 2007] 3In the event that the \"provider\" site declines reimbursement of resident S&B, the resident may seek alternate funding to reimbu rse the hospital. Alternate funding might come from grants, donations or other departmental funding. Educational grants, for example f rom pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturers, must be handled through IME. Residents may not participate in rotations in an unsalaried status2012-2013 165 IME/GME Policies2) If the program director approves of the proposed rotation, he/she shall forward the request on the designated template [provided by the IME GME Division], along with his/her approval, to the Director of Graduate Medical Education. The proposal shall include a summary of the proposed rotation, including: a. The proposed institution and location for the rotation including postal and email address b. Identification of officials responsible for resident education and supervision including detailed contact information c. An outline of the educational goals and objectives. The proposal should emphasize how the rotation fits in the educational plan of the resident, and how the experience will augment the resident's knowledge through experiences not available within this institution d. The period of assignment [proposed start and end dates] e. Financial support, including the source of funding for travel (if applicable) f. Provision of resident benefits, including malpractice insurance g. Institutional responsibility for teaching supervision and evaluation of the resident h. A designation of which institutional policies and procedures will govern the resident during the rotation i. A commitment from the resident to present a written and oral summary of the experience on return j. Signature of the Residency Program Director indicating support for the proposed rotation, and providing the following assurances: (1) that the resident's clinical performance and educational progress warrant rotations outside the direct supervision of the Residency Program Director, (2) that other rotations will be appropriately staffed during the resident's absence, and (3) that the rotation will not delay the resident's graduation from the program. 3) The GME Director will review the request along with the IME Executive Director. NOTE: No proposal submitted to the GME Director later than 60 days prior to the onset of the rotation will be approved . 4) If approved, the required signatures of all institutional officials will be requested. Once all the required signatures are obtained, copies of the signed/approved agreement will be returned to the resident, and to the residency program director. 5) The signed agreement must be in place before the rotation begins . Residents who leave without having an agreement in place may jeopardize their employment and risk not fulfilling requirements for graduation on time. ### Attachment: Appendix A ACGME Institutional Requirements, Section I.C.1 through I.C.3 I.

Guide to Vendor Relationships for HealthPartners and Its Related Organizations 2012-2013 185 IME/GME Policies GUIDE TO VENDOR RELATIONSHIPS FOR HEALTHPARTNERS AND ITS RELATED ORGANIZATIONS HealthPartners and its related organizations work with a wide variety of vendors and potential vendors - such as suppliers, dru g companies, staffing agencies, consultants, law firms and many more. These relationships are necessary and important to the wor k we do. However, sometimes these relationships also bring with them a personal or informal component. For example, have you ever eaten some pizza brought in by a sales rep? Have you gone to a sporting or entertainment event courtesy of someone you do busi ness with? Received a holiday gift basket from a consultant? Won a raffle for a mountain bike at a conference? Although they may seem innocuous, these types of arrangements have the potential to create conflicts of interest, or the appear ance that individuals in our organization may have a personal stake in their relationships with our vendors. Studies have shown tha t inappropriate relationships between the staff of health care organizations and their vendors can undermine patient and member t rust, interfere with professional decision-making and result in the waste of health care resources. While your Code of Conduct addresses conflicts of interest, entertainment, gifts and favors in general, it is not intended to r esolve all possible vendor arrangements and interactions. For that reason, we have created this guide to supplement the Code of Conduct, and to help all staff 1 make sound decisions when working with vendors2. This guide has three components that together describe the process you must follow whenever you are thinking about entering int o (or renewing) a relationship with a vendor - whether that relationship is formal or informal. 1. Ethical Considerations . These are fundamental questions to ask yourself each time you are considering a vendor arrangement. Your answers to these questions will help you decide whether an arrangement passes your personal standards of integrity. 2. Basic Rules and Examples . These are basic, practical rules that you must follow in every vendor relationship. The examples given describe some common types of arrangements in health care, and identify which ones are considered acceptable and which are not. 3. Beyond the Basics - Getting Help . If the arrangement you are considering appears to meet the Ethical Considerations but is not addressed in the Basic Rules, then you are asked to consult with the Corporate Integrity Department. They will help you make adecision that reflects not only the organization's values and responsibilities, but also your own. 1 \"Staff\" includes employees, employed pr oviders, privileged providers, residents, in terns, students, volunteers and Board memb ers of HealthPartners and its related organizations. 2 \"Vendors\" include current and prospective suppliers and thei r representatives, including staffing services, consultants, phar maceutical and medical device companies, and service providers such as law firms and auditors. Guide to Vendor Relationships Page 1 of 5 February 5, 20072012-2013 186 IME/GME Policies 1. Ethical Considerations The following questions were designed to help you conduct your own \"gut check\" when considering any interaction with a vendor. If the interaction does not pass your own \"gut check,\" then you should not agree to it. (You may notice that most of these questions reflect the organization's Values of Teamwork, Respect, Passion and Integrity.) \u0089Will the interaction enhance (as opposed to erode) the trust of others? Consider the trust of patients, members, coworkers and others. \u0089Does the interaction respect the interests of those affected by it? Some of the people who may be directly or indirectly affected by our relationships with vendors are patients, members, research participants, customers, regulators and the community as a whole. \u0089Would I be able to face myself and my colleagues if this interaction were to come to light? \u0089Would I be proud of this interaction if it were disclosed to those affected by it (for example, my patients and colleagues) or to the larger community (for example, in the media)? \u0089Is this interaction consistent with the values of the organization ? Guide to Vendor Relationships Page 2 of 5 February 5, 2007If you did not answer \"yes\" to all of these questions, then you should not proceed with the interaction. 2012-2013 187 IME/GME Policies 2. Basic Rules and Examples These are basic, practical rules that you must follow in every vendor relationship. Gifts, donations, grants, sponsorships, entertainment activities, promotional items, consulting fees and honoraria may only be accepted or solicited from vendors if the interaction meets all of the following Basic Rules. HealthPartners and its related organizations encourage appropriate interactions between staff and vendors as long as those interactions \u0089Are designed to benefit patients or members, or to educate HealthPartners staff; \u0089Will not lead to overutilization, underutilization or inappropriate utilization of health care services; \u0089Will not raise patient safety or quality of care concerns; \u0089Would comply with federal and state laws including those relating to referrals (Anti-Kickback and Stark), tax-exemption and public programs; \u0089Do not present a conflict of interest; \u0089Will not compromise staff's independent judgment or interfere with professional duties; \u0089Will not embarrass or damage the reputation of the organization; and \u0089Comply in all other ways with the organization's Code of Conduct. Guide to Vendor Relationships Page 3 of 5 February 5, 2007On the next page are examples of interactions that you may face when working with vendors. The organization has identified which ones staff may engage in, and which ones they may not. 2012-2013 188 IME/GME Policies Examples . This list is not exhaustive, but it does identify several of the more common types of arrangements and interactions with vendors. Permitted Interactions Staff are permitted to interact with vendors in the following situations, so long as the Basic Rules on the previous page are a lso followed: xClinical and non-clinical department heads/chiefs may invite vendor representatives to present product information to staff for the purpose of staff education and product assessment; in such cases, vendors will not be permitted to provide meals, snacks, trinkets or other non-educational items. Sales representatives of vendors will not be permitted to canvas or \"drop in\" at clinical or administrative sites without such an invitation, although they may mail product literature to staff. xStaff may attend modest meals and receptions sponsored by vendors at conferences if such events are incidental to an educational program that has been approved for continuing education credit. xStaff may attend modest and occasional business courtesy meals (worth no more than $75) at the invitation of a vendor. xStaff may attend occasional legitimate charitable events at the invitation of a vendor. xStaff may solicit vendor support for patient care, research, education or fundraising purposes in accordance with organizational standards for those activities. Non-Permitted Interactions The following vendor interactions are not permitted: xStaff may not accept cash or cash-equivalents (such as gift certificates) from vendors. xStaff may not accept any item or service worth more than $75 that is primarily intended for personal use. xStaff may not participate in leisure activities sponsored by a vendor, such as golf, sporting events, theater, \"spa days\", etc. , unless it is a legitimate charitable event, or unless staff pay their own way and participation would not compromise independent judgment, interfere with professional duties, or embarrass or damage the organization's reputation. xStaff may not provide consulting or other services for which they are compensated by a vendor without full and continuing disclosure to the organization and prior written approval of the Vice President, Associate Medical Director or equivalent to whom his or her department or division reports.

This guide was designed to help you work through those common situations. However, we know it is not possible to construct a set of rules - or even to anticipate - all possible scenarios. If the interaction you are considering appears to meet the Ethical Considerations but is not covered by the Basic Rules, then you should consult with the Corporate Integrity Department. Corporate Integrity staff has worked with a broad spectrum of clinical and business leaders in the organization to develop a detailed set of \"Vendor Relations Standards\" for the purpose of addressing uncommon or unanticipated vendor interactions. When you contact Corporate Integrity, they will work through the Vendor Relations Standards to help you make a decision that reflects not only the organization's values and responsibilities, but also your own. Corporate Integrity may also consult with the leadership steering group, listed below, t o provide guidance on particular issues or types of issues. For more information about vendor relations in general, or for help in working through a particular decision, contact the Corporate Integrity Department. If you wish, you may consult the Vendor Relations Standards directly - they are posted on ERIC. However, because this is such a complex and ever-changing area, we believe you will find the expertise of those who are most familiar with the details of the Vendor Relations Standards to be an important resource.

PURPOSE Regions Hospital is committed to maintaining a work environment which is free from the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs to protect the health, safety, and well being of our patients, employees, and visitors. Regions Hospital has therefore adopted this Alcohol and Drug Testing Policy for employees. This policy is not intended as and should not be construed as a contract between the Hospital and any employee, except as required by applicable labor contracts. II. POLICY Regions Hospital prohibits the use, possession, transfer and sale of alcohol and/or illegal drugs while working, while on all premises owned or operated by the Hospital, and while operating any Hospital vehicle, machinery or equipment. It also prohibits reporting for work, and working anywhere on behalf of Regions Hospital under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs. The use and possession of properly administered prescription drugs or medication is permitted, provided that the effects of these drugs do not interfere with the employee's job performance or pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the employee, co-workers or patients. The use of prescription medications which contain a controlled substance but are used for a purpose or by a person for which they were not prescribed or intended, is prohibited. VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE:Employees are encouraged to voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol-related discipline or proceedings. An individual who does so will be granted time off for treatment, rehabilitation, and counseling in accordance with applicable labor contracts and/or non-contract Hospital policies. Employees who voluntarily disclose the excessive use of alcohol and/or illegal drugs before being confronted, tested, or otherwise involved in drug and/or alcohol-related discipline or proceedings will not be discriminated against because of this disclosure, nor will the information which is disclosed about use be used as the sole basis for discipline. Resources are available to employees through the Employee Assistance Program (EAP).2012-2013 191 IME/Selected Regions Hospital PoliciesGROUNDS FOR TESTING: Testing will be requested or required only under the circumstances described below. No test will be sought for the purpose of harassing an employee. All tests are conducted by a laboratory licensed by the State of Minnesota and certified by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. No test will be conducted by a testing laboratory owned or operated by Regions Hospital. Test results will be reported to Employee Health Service after review by a licensed Medical Review Officer (MRO). A. Reasonable Suspicion An employee may be requested or required to undergo an alcohol test and/or drug test if there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee: (a) is under the influence of alcohol and/or illegal drugs; (b) has violated the policy statement above; (c) has caused himself/herself or another employee to sustain a personal injury on any Regions premisis; (d) has caused a work-related accident, or (e) has operated or helped operate machinery, equipment, or vehicles involved in a work- related accident. B. Treatment Program An employee may be requested or required to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing if the employee has been referred by Regions Hospital for chemical dependency treatment. The employee may be requested or required to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing without prior notice during the evaluation or treatment period and for a period of up to two years following the referral for prescribed chemical dependency treatment. NOTIFICATION:When requesting or requiring an employee to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing, Regions Hospital will provide the employee with a copy of the Alcohol and Drug Testing Policy and provide the employee with an opportunity to read the policy. An employee should not drive home if they are suspected of being under the influence. Other transportation options should be arranged. RIGHT TO REFUSE TO UNDERGO ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING AND THE EFFECT THEREOF: Any employee has the right to refuse to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing. An employee who refuses to be tested and/or whose behavior prevents meaningful completion of alcohol and/or drug testing will be subject to discharge or other disciplinary action in conformity with applicable labor contracts and/or non-contract Hospital policies. If an employee refuses to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing, no test will be administered.2012-2013 192 IME/Selected Regions Hospital PoliciesRIGHTS IN CASE OF A POSITIVE TEST: A. After Initial Positive Result and First Time Positive Result on Confirmatory Test If the initial result on the alcohol and/or drug test is positive, the sample, which was tested, will be subject to a second, confirmatory test. No employee will be discharged, disciplined, discriminated against, or requested or required to undergo rehabilitation solely on the basis of an initial test result which is positive. An employee will not be discharged (per Minnesota Statute 181.953 subsection 10 B) based on a first time positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital unless he or she has been given the opportunity to participate in a drug or alcohol counseling or rehabilitation program and has refused to participate or has failed to successfully complete the counseling program. Additionally, an employee must go to the Employee Assistance Program and comply with their recommendations. Failure to do so will lead to discharge. For employees with required licensure or registration for their position the appropriate licensing or certification boards will be notified of the positive test as appropriate. B. Subsequent Positive Result on Later Confirmatory TestAn employee who receives a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital and who has previously received a positive result on a confirmatory test for alcohol and/or illegal drugs requested or required by the Hospital may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge, in accordance with applicable labor contracts and/or non-contract Hospital policies, so long as the previous positive result occurred within the three preceding years. If the result of the confirmatory test is positive, an employee has the right to explain the reasons for the positive test and to request a confirmatory retest of the sample, to be conducted at the employee's expense. Any employee wishing to exercise these rights must do so within five (5) working days of receiving the positive confirmatory test. In the case of employees covered by labor contract, additional internal appeal mechanisms may be available. NEGATIVE RESULTS: If the initial result of the alcohol and/or drug test is negative or the confirmatory test result is negative, the employee is considered to have satisfactorily completed the alcohol and/or drug test. ADDITIONAL RIGHTS OF EMPLOYEES: An employee who is requested or required to undergo alcohol and/or drug testing will be provided with a copy of the test results upon request. CONFIDENTIALITY: The fact that an employee has been requested or required to take an alcohol and/or drug test, the result of the test, and information acquired in the alcohol and/or illegal drug testing process shall be treated in a manner consistent with the Hospital's treatment of other private and confidential information concerning employees.

POLICY Approved Devices Mobile computing and storage devices containi ng or accessing HealthPartners/REG information must be approved prior to connecting to the Heal thPartners/REG network or related systems. This pertains to all devices connecting to the Heal thPartners/REG network, regardless of ownership. Mobile computing and storage devices include, but are not limited to: laptop computers, tablet computers, smartphones, pagers, cam eras, personal digital assistants (PDAs), Universal Serial Bus (USB) storage devices, key fobs (hard tokens), Compact Discs (CDs), Digital Versatile Discs (DVDs), flash drives , handheld wireless devices, camera memory sticks/cards, and any other existing or future mobile computing or storage device owned by HealthPartners and/or may connect or acce ss HealthPartners/REG applications and the network. Includes devices that store or acce ss sensitive data: patient, member, employee, and company confidential data. A risk analysis for each new media type shall be conducted and documented prior to its use or connection to the HealthPa rtners/REG network unless the media type has already been 2012-2013 238 IME/Selected Regions Hospital Policies approved by the COS Standards Committee. Th e COS Standards Committee will maintain a list of approved mobile computing and storage devices. Teleworking activities conduc ted on personal computers must maintain protections when connecting to the organizations' network: physically secure d, up-to-date anti-virus software, firewall protection , operating system patches and remote access only by authorized personnel. Reference the Remote Access Policy, REG-SEC-100-60, the Network Access Control Policy, REG-SEC-100- 26 and User Responsibilities Policy, REG- SEC-100-25. Only HealthPartners approved mobile storage devices with encryption enabled will be allowed to write back to the mobile storage de vice. All other mobile storage devices will only be allowed to read from the mobile stora ge device. Real-time virus scanning of the mobile storage device will be enabled to further mitigate any malicious code threats. Patient images must only be taken with appr oved HealthPartners cameras. Patient photos should not be taken with personal smartphones, personal cameras or any other personal device. Reference the User Responsib ilities Policy REG-SEC-100-25 and the Organizational Privacy Standard for Photography, Videotaping and Other Recordings of Patients and Members. Corporate e-mail can only be synched to a Heal thPartners approved phone or PDA and only with approved Wireless E-mail Acce ss software from the Desktop Standards list (GoodLink or ActiveSync). It is prohibited to synch a Health Partners approved phone to another phone or to synch to your personal accounts (i.e. personal folders, email, contacts, & calendars) and/or to use unapproved Wireless E-mail Access software for data synchronization to the HealthPartners network (MobileMe). Please note, it is acceptable to view your personal e-mail from your phone, but prohibited to synch your HealthPart ners e-mail to your personal e-mail account via your phone. Some smartphones and PDA devices have the abil ity to function as a personal Wi-Fi or hotspot. This capability is not allowed on or at any Health Partners facilities and should be disabled. These radio frequencies can interfere with other e quipment in use at HealthPartners facilities.

Individuals or their legal representative can cons ent to receiving their own information in an unencrypted format (i.e. unencrypted CD). Data must be saved on the HealthPartners/REG network, i.e. on a share drive and not the device. For example, save a spre adsheet containing patient data on the HealthPartners' share drive and not on a laptop's desktop. Cameras containing patient images must not be used as a data store device; the photo must be immediately downloaded and saved to th e patient's record, then deleted from the camera 's memory and/or the memory stick/card . The only exception is for the use of USBs or flash drives, wherein the primary storage remains the HealthPartners/REG network and th e data is deleted from the devices when the business purpose is not needed anymore. 2012-2013 239 IME/Selected Regions Hospital Policies Employee / Contractor / Consultant Responsibilities Users of mobile computing and storage devices mu st diligently protect such devices from loss of equipment and disclosure of Protected Information be longing to or maintained by HealthPartners / REG.

External E-Mail means e-mail transmitted from an @healthp artners.com e-mail address to an e-mail address that is not an @healthpartn ers.com e-mail address, even if th at e-mail address is part of an e- mail system maintained by a HealthPartners-related or ganization (for example, an e-mail message from jane.x.doe@healthpartners.com to joe.x.smith@hudsonhospital.org is an External E-mail). Secure E-Mail means Internal E-mail or e-mail transmitted using (1) On line Patient Services; (2) the Secure Mail tool installed by IS&T as a software add-on to a regular Outlook e-mail account; or (3) another secure e-mail meth od arranged through IS&T. Basic Rules: 1. These standards apply to any e-mail used to communi cate with or about patients or members, or about any other matter related to HealthPartners' business. 2. Use only Secure E-Mail when sending an External E-Mail. 3. Do not send Protected Information via e-mail using personal or web e-mail programs (for example, Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo or Comcast accounts). 4. Do not send Protected Information via e-mail to your personal e-mail account(s). 5. Make sure Internal and External E-mail conform to the following requirements: Subject line: Do not include any Protected Informati on, any identifying information about a member, patient or research study pa rticipant in the Subject line of an e-mail. For example, do not include patient or member names or identifi cation numbers, but you may include patient or member initials. Recipients: Send e-mail only to those people wh o need the information to do their work. Distribution list: If using a distribution list, make sure all members of the list actually need to receive the informatio n and then make sure you're using the correct list. Content: The content of the e-mail and any attachme nts should follow the Minimum Necessary Rule. Header/Footer: The following text must be included in all e-mails that contain Protected Information or other sensitive information: Using E-Mail to Communicate With and About Patients and Members For help, contact your supervisor or th e Office of Integrity and Compliance at privacy@healthpartners.com or 952-883-5124.

If a member, patient or research study partic ipant initiates e-mail communication via our HealthPartners website to your healthpartners.com address, you may send an External E-mail using your healthpartners.com account to acknowledge it s receipt. But the response should (a) include no additional Protected Information, and (b) notify the sender that future e-mail communication with the sender will need to be conducted only through Secure E-Mail. 2. There are only limited additional exceptions to th e e-mail communication requirements described in this standard, and whether they apply will depend on the individual circumstances. If you are considering using e-mail in a manner other than permitted under this standard, you must first consult with IS&T Security Management. Examples: 1. Patient sends an e- mail to provider's healthpartners.com e -mail address. Provider should not use his or her healthpartners.com account to reply to patient's e -mail. Instead, the provider should use Secure Messaging through Online Patient Services. If the patient does not have an Online Patient Services account, the provider may: Call the patient; Send an e-mail to the patient via the HealthPa rtners.com account that only acknowledges the patient's e -mail and encourages the patient to si gn up for Online Patient Services. 2. Employer requests a monthly claims report. Before sending the report, the HealthPartners claims staff must coordinate with the employer to establi sh an agreed upon secure transmission method: Secure E-mail, E-transfer, TLS, or transmission by the IS&T EDI team. 3. Employee receives an Internal E-mail containing Protected Information that the employee does not need for his or her work. Employee should reply on ly to the sender to report that the e-mail was sent to him or her in error, and then delete the e-mail. 4. You send a Secure E-Mail containing Protected Inform ation to an external party. After sending, it comes to your attention that either the wrong recipi ent received it or the content of the e-mail was the wrong content. You should report the prob lem immediately to the Office of Integrity and Compliance. Practical Tips: 1. If you receive an e-mail where you are one of ma ny recipients and the e-mail requires your response, do not automatically use the \"reply all\" function. Instead carefully consider who needs the information you will provide in response and se nd your response only to those individuals.

If you receive an e-mail in error, respond only to the sender (not the entire recipient list) to inform the sender of the mistake. 3. Be aware that most e-mail is not secure, and therefore it is easily hacked or intercepted. E-mail is not private like a telephone. 4. Keep in mind that e-mail systems such as Micr osoft Outlook often have automated features that make it extremely easy to put in the wrong addressee or distribution list by mistake. 5. Remember, once you send an e-mail to someone with in or outside the organization, they can easily forward it to someone else - or to hundreds of other people! Once you hit \"send,\" you have lost control of the information in that e-mail forever. Important Reminder: These are important standards for you to follow.

Important Reminder: Other Resources2012-2013 272 IME/Selected Regions Hospital PoliciesPURPOSE: The purpose of these procedures is to establish standards for using faxes to communicate with or about patients or research study participants. Although faxing can be a convenient and efficient form of communication, it is important to recognize that it can also pose some risks on the privacy of Protected Information. For that reason, HealthPartners/Regions Hospital -as a provider and as a health researcher - must weigh these risks against the benefits when deciding whether, when and how to communicate via fax. By following these procedures, the risks inherent in the use of faxes will be minimized, although not necessarily eliminated. POLICY: All Facsimile (fax) transmittals generated or received by Regions Hospital personnel, that contain personal health or other Protected Information must follow established procedures to protect the confidentiality and integrity of confidential medical information as required by law, professional ethics, and accreditation requirements. All supervisors are responsible for enforcing these guidelines. Failure to comply with this procedure will result in appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal. PROCEDURE : 1.General Considerations a.All faxes sent by Regions Hospital personnel - whether intended to be communicated only internally or also externally - should follow these procedures. Likewise, Regions Hospital personnel who expect to receive Protected Information via fax should also follow these procedures. There may be times when even following these procedures might not offer appropriate protection for the information included in fax transmissions. Conversely, there may be times when following these procedures might unduly interfere with providing quality care and service. Accordingly, personnel should not rely solely on these procedures when deciding whether and how to communicate sensitive information via fax. b.Due to the nature of fax technology, the possibility of transmission errors and the frequency, with which fax machines may be accessed by multiple people, special precautions must be taken to protect the confidentiality of Protected Information. c.Providers, health plans and researchers must weigh these risks against the benefits when deciding whether to communicate Protected Information via fax. (Consult the Privacy Policy or Privacy Guidelines to determine what is considered \"Protected Information.\") 2.Fax Cover Sheet a.Standard Cover Sheet Template - All business units must use the standard fax cover sheet components for faxes that contain Protected Information. The standard cover sheet template may be found on the Corporate Integrity section of ERIC (HealthPartners Intranet) in the Privacy link http://intranet.healthpartners.com/ . The standard template contains a confidentiality heading that has been approved by HealthPartners legal counsel. See attachment A. b.Fax Cover Sheet Components include : i. - Confidential - Whenever possible, all pages of all confidential documents to be faxed should be marked \"Confidential\" before they are transmitted. ii. - Recipient information - Name, department/company, fax number and phone number of the intended recipient should be included on the fax cover sheet. iii. - Sender information - Name, department, address, fax number and phone number of the person who sent the fax should be included on the fax cover sheet. iv. - Other information - Number of pages transmitted, date and time of fax. Whenever possible, the subject line on the fax cover sheet should not contain any information that identifies the person who is the subject of the fax (e.g., no patient or member names or ID numbers).

If your business unit regularly sends or receives faxes that contain Protected Information, you should take the following precautions: i. Place fax machines that are used to transmit Protected Information in areas that are not routinely accessed by people who are not authorized to view the Protected Information. ii. Avoid placing fax machines in areas that are accessible by the public (such as reception or waiting areas). iii. If possible, avoid sharing fax machines with other departments or business units that do not need to access the Protected Information that you are sending or receiving. 4. Confirm, Verify, Coordinat e a. One of the most important ways to safeguard the Protected Information contained in faxes is to be extremely cautious about fax numbers, recipients, arrival times and delivery. For example: i. If you regularly send faxes to certain people, consider programming their fax numbers into the fax machine and prominently display the name of the programmed recipient. ii. If possible, configure the fax machine so it routinely prints a confirmation of each outgoing transaction. In addition, consider attaching this printout to a copy of the document that was faxed and keep both in your files. iii. If you expect to receive a fax that contains Protected Information, try to coordinate its arrival with the sender. Likewise, if you are sending a fax, attempt to coordinate its arrival with the receiver. If this approach is not feasible within your area, it is recommended that an in-box be placed next to the fax machine to store received faxes. iv. Destroy, or follow sender's instructions for information faxed in error and immediately inform the sender. 5. Use Common Sense a. Don't assume that faxing is a secure mode of communication. Limit the Protected Information you fax (or agree to receive by fax) to the following circumstances: i. Communications that are time-sensitive or non-routine, when mail or courier is not feasible. For example, personnel may transmit proetected information by facsimile when urgently needed for patient care or required by a third-party payor for payment of a patient's claim. ii. Information transmitted must be limited to the minimum necessary to meet the requestor's needs. 6. Train fax users a. All personnel should be trained and periodically updated on the fax procedures and safeguards that are in place in their departments. 7. Report problems or suspected problems promptly a. If you suspect that fax procedures have been violated or an individual's privacy has otherwise been compromised follow the procedure for misdirected faxes below. 8. Procedures for Misdirected Faxes a. If a fax transmission containing Protected Information is not received by the intended recipient because of a misdial, check the internal logging system of the fax machine to obtain the misdialed number. b. If possible, a phone call (supplemented by a note referencing the conversation) should be made to the recipient of the misdirected fax requesting that the entire content of the misdirected fax be destroyed. If the recipient cannot be reached by phone, a fax should be sent to the recipient requesting that the entire content of the misdirected fax be destroyed. c. The fax confirmation sheet or activity report should be sent along with the misdirected fax cover letter to Corporate Integrity. It is the responsibility of the department sending the misdirected fax to forward this information to Corporate Integrity. 2012-2013 274 IME/Selected Regions Hospital Policies Subject User Responsibilities Policy Attachments Yes No Key words passwords, computer equipment, locking, mobile and storage devices, clear desk, cameras, printers, fax machines Number REG-SEC-100-25 Category Management of Information (MI) Effective Date 04-November-2008 Manual Information Security Policy Last Review Date 07-May-2012 Issued By IS&T Security Management Next Review Date 07-May-2013 Scope This policy applies to Regions Hospital and all of its operating units and related organizations (collectively, \"HealthPartners/ REG \").

PURPOSE The purpose of this policy is to establish HealthPartners / REG employee, consultant, and agent user responsibilities in the use and protection of HealthPartners / REG information and assets. II. POLICY Passwords Employees, consultants, and agents will be required to follow good security practices in their selection and use of passwords. All employees, consultants, and agents are required to: Keep passwords confidential. Do not share or ask someone for their passwords. Avoid keeping a record of passwords, unless they are stored securely by one of the approved methods: on paper in a locked cabinet/drawer or an encrypted flash drive. Change passwords whenever there is any indication of possible system or password compromise. Select strong passwords which are: 9 Easy to remember; select a phrase that means something only to you. 9 Not based on anything somebody else could easily guess or obtain using your personal information, i.e. names, telephone numbers, date of birth, etc. 9 Do not consist of dictionary words included in dictionaries. 9 Free of consecutive identical, all-numeric or all alphabetic characters. Change passwords at regular intervals and avoid re-using of passwords. Privileged accounts (accounts with more access rights) should be changed more frequently. 2012-2013 275 IME/Selected Regions Hospital Policies Change temporary passwords at the first log-on. Do not include passwords in any automated log-on process, i.e. stored in a macro or function key. Do not share individual user passwords, this includes indirect sharing of passwords by logging in for someone with your password and allowing them to use your access (i.e. logging in for them but not actually providing them with your user ID and password). Do not use the same password for business and non-business purposes. Employees, consultants, and agents must not use identical passwords for different systems in which they have access. Protecting computers, laptops, cameras, mobile computing and storage devices All employees, consultants, and agents are required to: 9 Terminate active sessions when finished, unless they can be secured by an appropriate locking mechanism (i.e. a password protected screen saver). 9 Log-off applications when the session is finished (i.e. turning off a computer screen is not sufficient). 9 Secure computers and terminals from unauthorized access by locking the computer when not in use or stepping away (i.e. pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete and then Enter). 9 Cable-lock laptops to workstations or secure in a locked drawer. 9 Keep electronic devices and equipment secure by keeping on you or stored in a locked drawer when not in use. This includes digital cameras and memory sticks/cards used to capture patient im ages (see Mobile Computing and Storage Devices Policy REG-SEC-100-6). 9 Must not leave laptops unattended in a car, take it with you. A password protected screensaver will be implemented to automatically lock systems that are unattended. Exceptions to this requiremen t will be documented using the Workstation Exception Request process. Clear desk and clear screen HealthPartners / REG confidential or PHI infor mation, i.e. on paper or electronic storage media, should be locked away (ideally in a safe or locked cabinet) when not required, especially when the office is vacated. Computers and terminals should be left l ogged off or protected with a screen and keyboard locking mechanism controlled by a password, token or similar user authentication mechanism. When equipment is unattended it must be protected by a key lock, password, or other control when not in use. Incoming and outgoing mail points and unattended facsimile machines must be protected. Documents containing HealthPartners / REG confidential or PHI information must be removed from printers, fax machines, cop iers, etc. immediately when not in use. Suspicious Activity All HealthPartners / REG employees, consultants and agents are responsible for securing day to day operations. If any HealthPartners / REG employees, consultants, and agents witness any suspicious activity they should inform IS&T Security Management immediately. 2012-2013 276 IME/Selected Regions Hospital Policies III.

Basic Rules: 1. Protected Information may only be given over the ph one if (A) the person receiving the information has a right to receive it, and (B) the identity of the person receiving the information has been verified. The standards described in both (A) and (B), below, must be met. (A) Callers only have a right to receive Protected Information if: The Caller is the patient or member who is the subject of the information; The Caller is an authorized legal representative of the person who is the subject of the information; The patient or member has specifically authorized the disclosure of the information to the Caller; or HealthPartners is otherwise authorized by law to release the information to the Caller. (B) No Protected Information may be released to a Caller without first verifying the identity of the Caller by requesting the full name of the patient or member, plus at least two (2) of the following pieces of information: Membership/insurance ID number Patient account number or medical record number Claim number or Authorization number Employer/group name Name of research study (if applicable) Date of birth (correct month, day and year) One other piece of information that exists in our system, such as current address or phone number. 2. When you verify a Caller's identity, ask the Call er for the information you need; DO NOT tell the Caller the information and ask the Caller to confir m. Instead, compare the information the Caller reports with the information you have on record. 3. If the information provided by the Caller does no t match the information in our records, then the requested Protected Information should not be gi ven to the Caller. Staff and providers should express an apology to th e Caller and explain that that our privac y standards do not allow release of Verifying Patient & Member Identity Over the Phone For help, contact your supervisor or th e Office of Integrity and Compliance at privacy@healthpartners.com or 952-883-5124. Definitions Basic Rules2012-2013 278 IME/Selected Regions Hospital PoliciesORGANIZATIONAL PRIVACY STANDARDS: VVerifying Patient & Member Identity Over the Phone information if we are not able to verify the C aller's identity - and explain that this is for the protection of our patients and members. If a Caller gives you veri fication information that is almost - but not quite - correct, you may give the Caller an opport unity to correct the mistake, but do not suggest what the error is (for example, if a p erson seems to have transposed digits in an identification number, you can tell the Caller that the number is not correct and ask the Caller to read it again). 4. SPECIAL NOTE FOR MINORS: If the Caller is the parent or Guardian of a Minor and the Protected Information relates to the M inor's reproductive health (including co ntraception, pregnancy, STDs), Hepatitis B or chemical dependency, the Protecte d Information must not be disclosed without the Minor patient or member's written Authorization - even if the caller pr ovides the appropriate verification information . Exceptions: 1. If the Caller is personally known to a caregiver or business leader (supervisor or manager), and the caregiver or business leader believes, in his or her pr ofessional judgment, that the Caller is who they say they are, and is authorized to receive the Protected Information, the caregiver or business leader may disclose the information, subject to the following: The caregiver or business leader must inform the Caller that caller verification information will be required in the future; and Disclosure must be documented in the member or patie nt's record, including name of C aller, what information was disclosed, purpose of disc losure, and the fact that caller verification information will be required in the future. 2. If the Caller requests general information that is not specific to a particular patient or member, we can give that information to the Call er without verifying his or her identity (for example, clinic hours or days of the week a particular provider works). Examples: 1. Member calls Member Services and asks for additional information on a claim received in the mail. The Member Services Representative should ask the member for her name and two additional pieces of identifying information (see list under Basic Rules ). 2. Medical Office Assistant (MOA) calls patient's home to leave an appointment reminder. When someone at the house pick s up the phone, the MOA asks for the p atient. The person who picked up the phone asks who is calling, and the MOA says that he is calling for [patient name] with an appointment reminder from HealthPartners. If th at person then begins to ask questions about the type of appointment, the MOA may not provide an y information about the kind or location of the Verifying Patient & Member Identity Over the Phone For help, contact your supervisor or th e Office of Integrity and Compliance at privacy@healthpartners.com or 952-883-5124. Definitions Basic Rules2012-2013 279 IME/Selected Regions Hospital PoliciesORGANIZATIONAL PRIVACY STANDARDS: VVerifying Patient & Member Identity Over the Phone appointment. MOA should only leave his name and a call-back number. If the person who answered the phone claims to be the patient, MO A should get at least two pieces of identifying information (see list). 3. Nurse leaves a voicemail for a 16-year-old pati ent requesting a call back; parent calls back - identifies herself as the patient's mother and provid es two correct pieces of identifying information for the patient. If the information relates to a \"s ensitive service\" (such as reproductive health or chemical health), the nurse must refrain from pr oviding any information to the parent. If the information does not relate to a \"sensitive serv ice,\" the nurse may provide the information to the parent. Practical Tips: 1. There is no need to be shy about as king the Caller for their verification information. If you are polite but firm, most people will understand that we are doing this for the protection of our members and patients. 2. If a Caller is reluctant to provide the information, it is important to clarify why you are asking: To protect the patient or member's privacy. 3. If you have left a message for a patient or member to call you, make sure to ask for the Caller verification information wh en the call is returned. 4. If you are concerned that the Caller is not who they say they are, even if they provide accurate verification information, you have a couple of good options: Politely place the Caller on hold, explain your concerns to your supervisor and ask your supervisor to resume the call, or Politely tell the Caller that you will call them ba ck shortly and call back at a number we already have documented for that person in our system.
