You need to go deeper and more expansive which is what a gifted healer can do for you. Spiritual healers look way beyond mental healing and physical healing.

A spiritual healing session will generally not be the same as your own or other people's previous experiences. When you go for spiritual healing, you are receiving something that is just for you as you are at that moment in time.

Let go of expectations and open yourself up to the possibilities of where spiritual healing can take you. The most common thing to expect from a spiritual healing session is to experience a lift and feel positive feelings and be thinking positive thoughts. You will likely notice an increase in your sense of well-being after your session. For some people though, it can feel like they have opened up Pandora's box. Their body and mind can go into what is known as a healing crisis as it goes into rapid healing that can go on for several days or even a few weeks. If you are experiencing this it is essential that you contact the healer that helped you and look at getting further healing to guide you through this with ease. Sometimes your subconscious mind and body are more ready to let go of years worth of blockages and stuck energies than you are consciously ready for. It is very important during a healing crisis to practise grounding techniques and allow the healing to take place rather than trying to resist it. Sometimes we have to swim through shit in order to find the beautiful, clear lake where we can bathe and cleanse ourselves. How can spiritual healing help improve your mental and emotional health?
