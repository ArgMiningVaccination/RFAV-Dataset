Tuong2,4,6, Depelsenaire1,3, C. Frazer2*and Mark A. F. Kendall1,5 Chemical adjuvants are typically used to improve immune responses induced by immunisation with protein antigens. Here we demonstrate an approach to enhance immune responses that does not require chemical adjuvants. We applied microprojection arrays to the skin, producing a range of controlled mechanical energy to invoke localised in flammation, while administering influenza split virus protein antigen. We used validated computational modelling methods to identify links between mechanical stress and energy generated within the skin strata and resultant cell death. We compared induced immune responses to those induced by needle-based intradermal antigen delivery and used a systems biology approach to examine the nature of the induced inflammatory response, and correlated this with markers of cell stress and death. Increasing the microprojection array application energy and the addition of QS-21 adjuvant were each associated with enhanced antibody response to delivered antigen and with induction of gene transcriptions associated with TNF and NF- B signalling pathways. We concluded that microprojection intradermal antigen delivery inducing controlled local cell death could potentially replace chemical adjuvants to enhance theimmune response to protein antigen. npj Vaccines (2019) 4:41 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-019-0134-4 INTRODUCTION Adjuvants were rst deployed in vaccines in the 1930s and have since been included as a component of many vaccines, deliveredby needles to enhance systemic antibody responses to immunis- ing proteins. 1-3However, only a few chemical adjuvants are licensed for the use in human vaccines, including various Alumcompounds, Monophosphoryl Lipid A and squalene-based MF59 . Adding adjuvant to a vaccine does not always improve theinduced protective response 4and some currently available vaccines, such as In fluenza and Tuberculosis, still induce levels of protection less than required to be broadly effective. Improvedvaccines may come from better adjuvants and from deeperunderstanding of how adjuvants induce enhanced protectionagainst infection. In contrast to intramuscular immunisation, intradermal antigen delivery accesses the high density of antigen-presenting cells in the skin. Here we tested whether a vaccine delivery devicetargeting the skin could use the energy of application to inducelocalised physical in flammation that might circumvent the need for chemical adjuvants. The idea of applying energy to the skin toimprove immune responses is not new. 5Examples of approaches that have been investigated include acoustic (e.g., sonophor-esis6,7), electrical (e.g., electroporation8,9) and others (e.g., lasers10,11). Mechanical means of delivery of vaccines, including ballistic gene guns delivery of vaccines, have been explored sincethe 1990s, although the effects of energy of application has notbeen investigated. 12,13Making mechanical delivery devicessuitable for practical vaccination programmes is challenging, as the design requirements, materials and energy sources are constrained by issues of costs and compactness. Here we quantify how energy delivered to the skin generates local in flammation that leads to improved systemic immune responses. We compare the local in flammatory response to mechanically delivered energy with that produced by injection of a typical subunit vaccine, using a simple, practical medical device to deliver mechanical energy to the skin that is suitable forwidespread vaccination of people. To evaluate the use of this mechanical energy as an adjuvant, we used a prototype (Nanopatch ) medical device, an array comprising of ultra-high density (20 000 cm 2) silicon micropro- jections, 4 \u00d7 4 mm in dimension (Supplementary Fig. 1), to deliver antigen to the skin in mice. Each microprojection has a cylindrical-shaped body and a tapered conical tip, measuring about 100 \u00b5m in length. Precision, accuracy and repeatability of immunisation is achieved by dynamically applying the Nanopatch to the skin, using a spring-loaded applicator.14We have previously shown that the Nanopatch enhances immune responses when contrasted with needle and syringe intradermal delivery of antigen.15 However, the mechanism of physical immune enhancement was not investigated. The most relevant literature is based on the adjuvanting effects of sterile in flammation and the release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). We hypothesise that controlled mechanical impact during the application of the application of the Nanopatch would cause limited and localised 1Delivery of Drugs and Genes Group (D2G2), Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland, St Lucia, QLD 4 072, Australia.2The University of Queensland Diamantina Institute, The University of Queensland Translational Research Institute, Street, address: QLD 4102, Australia.4Present address: MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.5Present address: The Australian National University, Canberra, ACT 2600, with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development1234567890():,;cell death, and the resultant innate in flammatory response would contribute to enhanced vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses.16 In this study, we compared conventional intradermal adminis- tration of antigen with a needle and syringe to antigen delivery byNanopatch , a device engineered to use mechanical energy to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin, and evaluated theresponse to vaccine delivered into the skin. Using a systemsvaccinology approach, we examined how the mechanicalresponse induced by the Nanopatch is associated with gene and pathway transcription changes that may contribute to theimproved antibody response. RESULTS Determining the stress distribution and cell death invoked in the skin by the application of vaccine delivery devices To examine how mechanical application of stress/energy to the skin is transmitted and how it is linked with skin cell death, weapplied a skin deformation and fracture model 17to estimate the consequences of static or dynamic application of flat plate, pillar or cylindrical -conical microprojection array (Supplementary Figs 2 and 3). Using choices of energy and penetration data fromprevious work, we compared the spatial distribution of stresscalculated by simulation with experimentally measured cell deathin mouse ear skin. The modelled stress distribution of both thestatic and dynamic application of the flat plate (Fig. 1a, b) was qualitatively consistent with observed cell death (Fig. 2a, b). The corners and edges of the application area induced localised cell death in all skin layers, in agreement with the higher stress predicted by the model in these regions (1 -5 MPa). However, in the dermis, experimentally measured distribution of cell deathupon static application was discrepant with the numerical model.This is likely due to the dif culty of the model capturing small- scale stress response including edge stress when simulating large-scale mechanical interaction with a flat plate (Figs 1and 2; viableepidermis (VE) and dermis marked with *). Dynamic application of a pillar array generated cell death tightly localised around the pillar heads in the VE, whereas the dead cell distribution expandedto cover most volume in the top and mid-dermis (Fig. 2c). This is consistent with the stress distributions calculated by the model (Fig. 1c, d), which shows stresses extending to a larger diameter in the dermis than in the VE. Skin cell death was observed following static flat array loading above ~0.34 N (Fig. 2a) and for all dynamic impact conditions tested (>3500 J/m 2). Comparing data from in silico modelling with observed cell death in ear tissue across the range of applied pressure and energy, we consistently observed that cell death was associated with local stresses above ~5 MPa (Figs 1and 2). The methods used to test skin cell mechanical tolerance for the flat plate and the pillar array were next used with a cylindrical -conical microprojection array, tested across a range of dynamic application energies (3500, 5800 and 11,200 J/m2; Supplementary Table 1). Cell death was closely localised around each microprojection in the VE, top- and mid-dermis (Fig. 3). This is in agreement with the calculated stress distribution, which peaked close to the microprojection tip-skin contact surface (Fig. 3). By comparing the co-localisation of stress magnitude along the stress contours with the observed cell death, we deriveda stress threshold for cell death between 5 and 15 MPa, similar to the value deduced from the flat plate and pillar array with static and dynamic loading (>5 MPa). The average modelled and cell death imaging validated stresses dynamic application were 30 MPa in the VE and 3 MPa in the dermis with the inclusion of edge stresses in the 16 mm2area. Adjuvant-like gene transcription changes following mechanical impact into the skin with or without antigen and adjuvant Having assessed by theoretical modelling the stress distribution in the skin induced by mechanical stress, and compared this with imaged experimental cell death, we next use a systems approach to determine the transcription changes induced by mechanical m c 3500 J/2 DVEd 5800 J/m2Pillar 1 mm** Fig. 1 Mathematical modelling of stress in the skin (VE viable epidermis, D dermis) following application of a flat plate surface or a pillar array statically with a weight, or dynamically with a constant energy. aFlat plate surface applied with static weights of (i) 0.34 N, (ii) 5.89 N, (iii) 19.62 N or (iv) 68.67 N, showing distribution of maximum principal stress. bFlat plate array applied with dynamic energies of (i) 3500 J/m2, (ii) 5800 J/m2or (iii) 11,200 J/m2, showing distribution of maximum principal stress. cPillar array applied with dynamic energies of (i) 3500 J/m2 or (ii) 5800 J/m2, showing distribution of Von Mises stress.

To do this, we use whole tissue RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyse changes in local gene expression, comparinguntreated skin with intradermal antigen delivery using acylindrical -conical type) 11,200 J/m 2, or needle and syringe antigen delivery, which delivers ~50 J/m2. Application of microprojection arrays coated with and puri ed Quillaja saponin adjuvant (QS-21) induced the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 4591DEGs) shown in Fig. 4a. DEGs) induced more DEGs thanapplication of a microprojection array without (1354DEGs). Needle and syringe intradermal injection of saline inducedthe of DEGs (711 DEGs), whereas needle andsyringe intradermal delivery of vaccine protein induced a highernumber of DEGs (3670 DEGs). These results suggest that QS-21,influenza vaccine and the physical impact of a microprojection array could each contribute substantially to the induction of geneexpression in the skin. To contextualise our ndings, we aligned our DEG data with those from a study by Mosca et al., 18in which a 'core adjuvant ' response gene signature was observed with their intramuscularadministration of chemical adjuvants (Alum, CpG and MF59 )i n comparison with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control. DEGsthat were found to be shared between the Mosca et al. 18dataset and our dataset were highlighted, revealing many DEGs that arecommon to both datasets (Fig. 4b). We expanded this analysis to perform a systematic comparison between our RNA-seq DEGdatasets and several vaccination studies with microarray data(Supplementary Table 2), 18-22using pre-ranked gene set enrich- ment analysis (prGSEA; Fig. 5a). Genes were ranked in our study by signed t-statistic values, to generate the ranked list of DEGs. Mouse genes sets were curated from Mosca et al.18and Caproni et al.,19whereas et al.20and Nakaya et al.23(Supplementary Table 3). Ranked following Nanopatch application without antigen at 3500 J/m2displayed signi cant overlap with Mosca et al.18gene signatures (IM, Alum/CpG/MF59 vs. PBS and CpG vs. PBS) and all 3500 and 11,200 J/m2application groups displayed signi cant enrichment of the gene sets of Caproni et al.19(IM, Alum/CpG/MF59 vs. PBS and Alum vs. PBS; Fig. 5b). Importantly, the upregulation of these genes was not observed following intradermal delivery of antigen by needle and syringe (Fig. 5b). Enrichment of the analogous human genes sets was also observed in Kazmin et al.,22using malaria vaccine, and Li et al.,20using the meningococcal polysaccharide quadrivalent vaccine (MPSV4/ MPSV) in Fig. 5. However, there was little overlap between the downregulated gene sets in the various studies (Fig. 5c). Changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells following immunisation were not seen in our datasets. We provide a summary table for all the gene sets tested for the prGSEA in Supplementary Table 3. Overall, greater enrichment was generally seen with the 3500 and 11,200 J/m2application groups than the needle and syringe intradermal 50 J/m2energy application to the other microarray studies. Molecular pathway analysis of mechanical stresses and cell death revealed clustering of highly correlated genes associated withimmunogenic roles Next, to further investigate whether distinct gene networks were correlated with cell death or application energy, we applied a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA; Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. 4). Figure 6b shows there are 27 distinct modules of highly correlated genes identi ed with WCGNA. Of these, seven gene modules in Fig. 6c were signi cantly positively correlated with cell death (Supplementary Table 4) or with application energy (Supplementary Table 1). These seven genemodules were further analysed. The blue module was upregulated signi cantly and correlated with increased cell death.

Limitation of model capturing small-scale stress response including edge stress marked with * in Fig. 1a demonstrated by cell death assay in aH.-I. Ng et al. 3 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 41 suggests a role for the genes in the blue module in immune enhancement from mechanical stimuli, as the difference was based on the energy applied during vaccination. Pathway enrichment using the Consensus Pathway Database (CPDB)showed that the top ve enriched pathways in the blue module were tumour necrosis factor (TNF) apoptosis, Toll-likereceptor (NF) B signalling pathways. The top ten pathways of the seven signi cant gene modules of interest are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6 and all pathways for all colour modules areprovided in Supplementary Data 1. Complementary to the pathway analysis, ClueGO 24was used to visualise the most important/highly connected non-redundantbiological functions enriched by the seven gene modulespositively (black, blue, brown, cyan; Supplementary Fig. 7) and negatively (green -yellow, light cyan and magenta; Supplementary Fig. 8) correlated with cell death. The enriched pathways in thesegene modules were similar to those demonstrated by CPDBanalysis (Fig. 6c and Supplementary Fig. 8) and included pathways associated with immune signalling, cell death and antibodyresponse. Pathways displaying module speci city (>60% genes from a single gene module) are highlighted. Several Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopaedia Genes and consititued foundspeci cally in the blue or brown modules and not the black and cyan modules (Supplementary Fig. 7). The blue module showed speci city for TLR signalling, cytokines and chemokines (i.e., interleukin 6, IL-17 and TNF) signalling, T-cell receptorsignalling and apoptosis, while the brown module displayedmodule speci city for microglial activation, antigen presentation, extracellular matrix pathways and B-cell-related antibody response(Supplementary Fig. 7). The brown module was signi cantly correlated to cell death measurement and the correlation was most prominent and statistically signi cant with 3500 J/m 2+ -yellow, light cyan and magenta; Supplementary Fig. 8) were also analysed, which showed that GO functions related to immune cell migration, cell death and stress response (Supple-mentary Fig. 7A), whereas there was limited enrichment of thecanonical KEGG and Reactome pathways (Supplementary Figs 8Band 8C). However, we noted that the three negatively correlated gene modules were common to all comparisons (Fig. 6b), which could be a physiological function, and there were too few clustersfor further analysis (Supplementary Fig. 8). Hence, we concludethat they do not reveal speci c changes that may pertain to physical adjuvantation. Finally, genes enriched in the top three pathways in the blue module (Fig. 6c) were plotted into an expression heatmap in Fig. 7. Inspection of enriched genes from the immune-related pathways of the blue module showed a clear trend of gene expression, with the highest expression by Nanopatch vaccination with QS-21 (Fig. 7). Similar induction of genes was observed in Nanopatch vaccination at the highest application energy at 11,200 J/m 2and this trend of gene induction was observed to gradually decreaseas the application energy reduces (Fig. 7). In contrast, the same genes in the needle and syringe intradermal vaccination groups at50 J/m 2were closer to baseline levels presented in the unim- munised control (Fig. 7). Interestingly, without vaccine co- administered, Nanopatch at 3500 J/m2enriched more of these genes than the needle and syringe intradermal 50 J/m2with vaccine, which suggests that the vaccine is a poor inducer ofphysical immune enhancement and potentially induce immune response using different mechanisms. Relating delivery to the skin, with distinct levels of mechanical energy application, to invoke local differential expression in genes and resultant systemic antibody responses The overarching requirement of vaccines is that they generate effective systemic immune responses. Therefore, we comparedthe antibody response to the immunisation strategies to assesswhether the changes in local gene expression were correlatedwith the magnitude of the antibody response following immuni-sation with in fluenza vaccine. Hemagglutinin (HA)-induced anti- body responses 21 days post immunisation were compared after intradermal administration by needle and syringe or by the Nanopatch at three application energies. With increasing application energy, the speci c antibody responses increased signi (ANOVA) p< 0.001; Fig. Supplementary Fig. 9).

Thus, delivering vaccine to the skin with increased application energy without chemical adjuvant induced similar improvementsto antibody response to those achieved using a chemicaladjuvant. This correlated with the pathway analysis (Fig. 6) and gene changes (Fig. 7) observed. The data support a hypothesis that enhancing physical adjuvantation by the use of a skin delivery device can increase the magnitude of a humoral immuneresponse to a similar extent to those achieved by traditionalchemical-based adjuvants. DISCUSSION This study demonstrated that a skin delivery device (Nanopatch ) applying mechanical energy could potentially replace the use ofchemical adjuvant to improve vaccine-induced antibody response.Mathematical models simulating interaction of mechanicalenergy, applied by delivery devices to the skin resulting in spatial stress distribution in various skin layers, correlate consistently with cell death, with an estimated threshold of 30 MPa in the VE and3 MPa in the dermis. Using a systems biology approach,investigation of the mechanism of vaccine-induced immuneresponse associated with varying mechanical energies appliedby the Nanopatch demonstrated the enrichment of immunolo- gically relevant DEGs and pathways, and shown similar pro les to chemical adjuvants. Therefore, it is likely to be that the use of mechanical energy enhances immune response through therelease of endogenous/native damage response molecules atthe site of antigen delivery, creating local in flammation. Althoughthis concept is not new, we have, in this study, quanti ed the relation between mechanical stimuli to the skin cell death,transcriptomic changes, and the resultant systemic antibodyresponse. Speci cally, we correlated experimental cell death imaging with simulation of a theoretical skin deformation model in skin stressdistribution of a vaccine delivery device. Macro- and micro-level analyses were performed using the whole array (Figs 1a, b and 2) and single projection (Figs 1c and 3). In all tested conditions, the stress-induced cell death was consistently observed at an averageof 30 MPa in the VE and 3 MPa in the dermis (Figs 1and 2). However, certain limitations apply. Calculated stress in the VE waslikely affected by errors due to the large size of the nite elements used in modelling, and required to avoid element distortion andalso to the interaction of skin model with the array base. Celldeath in the deep dermis was not examined because of the likelyeffects on cell viability of split ear preparation. The agreementbetween the observed stress thresholds for cell death across thevarious models was otherwise consistent, even though skin viscoelasticity and size-dependent mechanical response cause an effective change in the elastic modulus from ~10 3Pa, when loaded statically by flat plate, to ~106Pa when loaded dynamically with the microprojection array. In particular, this ~1000-foldchange in modulus causes an approximate directly proportional to~1000-fold change of the stress magnitude generated by anequivalent deformation. This test conducted using dynamicmicroprojection thus effectively validates the stress-induced celldeath model trained on static and dynamic flat plates and pillars, providing con dence that we can rationally engineer device designs and application conditions to achieve tailored cell deathamounts and spatial distributions. With the understanding of the interaction between the skin and mechanical energy, we reasoned that the magnitude of cell deathshould re flect the increased energy applied using the skin delivery device, which was observed to increase measured systemicimmune response. This hypothesis was supported by the4000 3000 2000 1000 0 Set Size Intersection Size2000 1500 + vaccine at 11200 J/m2 2 2 22 2 Fig. 4 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the skin following different modes of intradermal immunisation. aTotal number of DEGs for each vaccination condition (horizontal bars colour coded as per legend) and distribution of number of DEGs (vertical black bars), found eithercommonly shown as connected black circles or exclusively shown as single black circle. bComparative analysis assessing the regulation of cytokine and chemokine genes following physical and chemical adjuvantation (Mosca et al.18).

Ng et al. 5 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 41 increased number of DEGs found in the site of vaccination (Figs 4a and 7). Transcriptomic pro ling revealed an enhanced local immune response involving interactions in extracellular matrix,and triggering the IL-6, IL-17 and TNF signalling pathways and antigen presenting through TLR signalling to activate B-cell receptor signalling (Fig. 6and Supplementary Figs 6 and 7). These changes correlated with improvements in antibody response withhigher mechanical energy application of antigen and were comparable to those induced by chemical adjuvants (Fig. 8). Thus, skin delivery by Nanopatch induced localised cell death as a result of controlled micro-trauma caused by application and acted as a 'physical immune enhancement 'to prime immune cells for antigen uptake and induced response. The Nanopatch is designed to be a practical, needle-free way of delivering vaccine to the skin with adjustable mechanical energy for improved immune responses. However, there are other ways the energy has been transmitted for vaccine delivery.Previous studies have shown that laser illumination vaccination, at a dose of ~90 J/cm 2of application energy, demonstrated an improvement of antigen uptake and antigen-speci c antibody response.10,25-27This improvement possibly re flected application energy from a mixture of sources, including mechanical and thermal emission. A prior study from our group (Charkrabortyet al.28) demonstrated that heat-induced sterile in flammation enhanced CD8+T-cell responses. We have also demonstrated similar enhancement of CD8+T-cell responses27,29and antibody response16,30in previous studies using 80- to 250-fold lower application energy than the laser illumination. An earlier delivery system, the ballistic gun uses mechanical energy to power DNA or protein antigens formulated in microparticles into the skin at highspeed (200 -800 m/s).31Despite having a velocity of about 30 times higher than the Nanopatch , systemic immune response were regularly equivalent to conventional delivery methods.32,33 Most of these technologies, and InfluenzaQuerec et al.

Ng et al. 6 npj Vaccines (2019) 41 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Developmentmicroprojection cutaneous delivery,34-37have demonstrated equivalent or better responses to antigen than traditional needleand syringe. Gene gun and laser illumination deliver enhancedresponses to antigen but require an additional complex entity to power the delivery (e.g., pressurised helium gas or motorised by electronics), potentially increasing the cost of vaccination and thesize of the delivery device. Thus, microprojection arrays (such as the Nanopatch ) may be a preferred mode of skin delivery of antigen, using simple application by mechanical means to target skin layers with high abundance of antigen-presenting cells. The improved immuneresponse with higher mechanical application energy enhancesTNF signalling, apoptosis, TLR signalling and induction of IFN- / and NF- B signalling (Figs 6and 7, and Supplementary Fig. 7). Activation of these pathways at the transcriptome level is likely areflection of an overall enhanced localised response to antigen delivery. We acknowledge that RNA transcript changes do not necessa- rily translate to changes at the protein level. Other studies haveused post-vaccination sera for the detection of cytokines andchemokines to identify transcriptomic changes induced by their delivery systems, however it was largely restricted to selected immune related protein responses (e.g., IgG response, IL-6, IL-12,IL5 and CCL5). 18,29,38The published literature covers transcrip- tomic data from mice and humans, at different tissue sites including peripheral blood, skin and muscle biopsy, and hasemployed different analytic methods, including microarray orRNA-seq and at time points day 0, day 3 or day 7 post vaccination with one to three vaccine doses.

Ng et al. 7 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 41 the curated gene sets from publicly available vaccinology datasets highlighted similarities in the transcriptomic changes induced byphysical immune enhancements to those induced by chemicaladjuvants (i.e., Alum, CpG and MF59). The mechanical impactapplied by the Nanopatch is thus likely to induce similar biological effects to chemical adjuvants 18,19and should result in the induction of an equivalent or better vaccination response. Future studies of physical immune enhancements in humans are warranted. Due to genetic dissimilarity and skin differences,the translation of physical immune enhancers in a differentspecies might change. Even though there are homologous genesin mice and human, the mechanical properties of human skinrequire further understanding, e.g., skin thickness, 39viscoelasti- city40or diseases in the skin can potentially affect the interaction between the skin and delivery devices; hence, this changes thesystemic immune response invoked. Further understanding of stress-induced cell death in the skin should advance the rational design of next-generation vaccine and skin delivery technology. In summary, our ndings support adoption of mechanical delivery systems such as the Nanopatch as a safe and effective vaccination approach that capitalises on the use of controlled mechanical energy to stress the skin cells and induce native/ endogenous physical immune enhancements from the skin as amode for enhancing vaccine-induced immunogenicity. The microneedle technology has attracted considerable interest as a vaccine delivery and the ability to mitigate risks associated with conventional vaccination method with the needle andsyringe. Two recent human clinical trials by Rouphael et al. 41 and Fernando et al.42demonstrated the potential of the microneedle technology as a vaccine delivery system. Both studies demonstrated well-tolerated reactions on the skin and atleast an equivalent immune response compared with the conventional vaccination method. Furthermore, Rouphael et al.41 has shown that the microneedle technology can be self- administered, which could potentially remove the need ofhealthcare workers during vaccination. However, these microneedles are slightly different to the ones used in this study (mouse prototype), in terms of projectiondensity, length, morphology, array dimensions, application speedand material of the patch (dissolving vs. silicon), this affects the interaction between microprojection tip-skin contact (i.e., skin stress distribution, skin fracture/cell death threshold, vaccinedissolution in the skin, immune regulation from mechanical stress, to name a few). To add on to the complexity, preclinical studies in naive animals showed superior immunogenicity and vaccineefcacy post patch vaccination, whereas human volunteers are likely to have pre-existing immunity from previous exposure, making it harder to measure the improvement due to the application of a microneedle/patch. Although there are challenges to overcome, the logistical and administration aspect of the vaccination using microneedle/patch are attractive. Within the next few years, microneedle technology is likely to play a vital role in vaccine delivery technology andcould replace the needle and syringe. METHODS Animals All methods performed in this study were carried out in accordance with National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines andwere approved by The University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee.All animal care and experiments were conducted in accordance with NHMRC (Australia) guidelines and with the approval of The University of Queensland animal ethics committee under AIBN/556/12/ARC/NHMRC/SMART or AIBN/043/16/ARC/NHMRC/SMART/WHO. Female C57BL/6J miceof 6 -8 weeks were used per condition and they were maintained under speci c pathogen-free condition with food ad libitum in the animal facility of the Australian Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, The University of Queensland. Vaccine formulation Intanza \u00ae2013 Lyon, France) is subunit protein vaccine containing 90 \u00b5g/ml HA proteins from each in fluenza strains, A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like strain, A/Victoria/361/2011(H3N2)-like strain and B/Wisconsin/1/2010-like strain. The formulations were calculated to deliver 30 ng of Intanza \u00ae2013, with or without 1.5 \u00b5g of QS-21 (Desert King International, San Diego, CA, USA) to each of the mousemodel based on Supplementary Fig. 1, with Dulbecco 's PBS (dPBS; Gibco/ Life Technologies) as the diluent. immunisation were prepared by diluting Intanza \u00ae2013 in dPBS to the appropriate dose (30 ng) and administered to enriched in TNF signaling pathway, Apoptosis and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway Relative Gene Expression Z-score Fig. 7 Relative expression heatmap of the genes enriched in TNF signalling, apoptosis and TLR-signalling pathway.

Ng et al. 8 npj Vaccines (2019) 41 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine DevelopmentTo induce physical immune enhancements while vaccinating into the skin, the Nanopatch was used. These Nanopatch were manufactured as described elsewhere,43measuring 4 \u00d7 4 mm with a density of 20,000 microprojections per cm2and microprojections were 110 \u00b5m long. The Nanopatch were cleaned with 70% ethanol, rinsed with MilliQ water and air dried. The Nanopatch vaccine formulation the diluent. Vaccine formulation was dry coated on to the Nanopatch by a 70\u00b0 and 20\u00b0 angle nitrogen gas jet as described previously.44One patch per mouse was used to vaccinate mice with a spring-loaded applicator at a constant velocity as speci ed in Supplemen- tary Table 1, to penetrate microprojections into the ear skin of mice, left for 2 min to allow the reconstitution and diffusion of the dry-coated vaccine. The amount of vaccine delivered into the skin was quanti ed using a radioactive tracer and calculated as delivery ef ciency (Supplementary Fig. 1). Vaccinations using the Nanopatch were calculated accordingly and no radioactive tracer was included. Mathematical modelling of mechanical induction of stress on to the skin Briefly, static application allows the array (with mass of 0.035, 0.6, 2 or 7 kg, inducing 0.34, 5.89, 19.62 and 68.67 N, respectively) to rest on the skin for 2 min. Dynamic application requires an applicator to re the array at a constant energy (3500, 5800 or 11,200 J/m2) and the arrays are rested on the skin for 2 min, similar to the transcutaneous immunisation. The stress distributions were computed using the nite element model of the skin developed in Meliga et al.17and were solved using Abaqus Providence, RI, USA). cally, the mouse ear was represented as a seven-layer material constituted by a 70 m-thick cartilage layer sandwiched between the ventral and dorsal skin tissues having the following geometry: a 5 m-thick stratum corneum (SC), a 15m-thick VE and a 60 m-thick Dermis (D). The viscoelastic skin behaviour was simulated using the Ogden model; hence, hyperelastic parameters varied with the skin-probe contact area and deformation velocity according to Crichton et al.45measurements. For example, the 11,200 J/m2microprojection application was simulated using respectively the following Young 's moduli and stretch exponents: 187 MPa and 5.77 for the SC, 2.7 MPa and 162 for the VE, 401 MPa and 15.5 for the D, 0.02 MPa and 115 for the Cartilage. The complete set of rate and size-dependent moduli and exponents is summarised in Meliga et al.17Similar to that in our previous work,17we used the following properties for SC, VE, D and Cartilage: mass densities were 1.3, 1.1, 1.27 and 1.3 g cm3, respectively. Poisson 's ratio was set to 0.45. For the microprojection simulations, penetration was simulated using a ductile failure model with critical stresses at the onset of fracture of 70, 2 and 12 pJ m2, and damage dissipation energies of 35, 1 and 6 pJ/\u00b5m2for the SC, VE and D, respectively. The probes were assumed to be rigid and have a friction coefcient of 0.4.Sample collection Ear skin samples were obtained 4 h post vaccination and was snapped frozen using liquid nitrogen. All biopsies were weighted and kept at 80 \u00b0C for further RNA-seq analysis. Blood was collected by retro-orbital bleeds on day 21. Blood was kept at room temperature for 2 h for clotting before centrifugation at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 5 min to separate sera from whole blood. Sera were kept at 80 \u00b0C for further serological analysis. Cell viability staining using multi-photon microscopy Skin samples were prepared and cellular viability was assessed similar to a previous study,15using \u00d710 and \u00d720 air objectives (Zeiss, Germany). Brie fly, the ear skin was split, cartilage was carefully removed and stained using amixture of acridine orange (0.03 mg/ml) and ethidium bromide (0.1 mg/ ml), labelling live (green) and dead (magenta) cells, respectively. Positive controls were pre-treated with ice-cold methanol before staining. Multi-photon microscopy (MPM) images were taken from four to six ear skinsample from different mouse per condition, except for naive condition (n=2; from different mouse). MPM images taken (one \u00d710 overview image, one \u00d720 edge image and one \u00d720 centre image, unless otherwisespeci ed) using software LSM510 and image acquisition using ZEN (both from Zeiss, Germany). A representative image was used. Serological analysis \u2014antigen-speci c antibody response using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ntigen-speci c (day 21 sera) was by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) similar to previous study.16Briefly, 3 \u00b5g/ml of antigen (Intanza 2013) was diluted and used to coat ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp, ThermoFisher) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. The plates were blocked with 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS and were used to determine theantigen-speci c antibody titres. Sera were diluted to 1:100 with 0.4% BSA in PBS, then serially diluted and incubated for 2 h in room temperature. Washing of plates were done ve times using 0.02% BSA in PBS to obtain a nal concentration of 1 \u00b5g/ml and this was added and incubated for 1.5 h. Colour development was performed using ABTS(2,29-azino-bis3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid; A-1888, Sigma- Aldrich) as the substrate and measured at absorbance of 405 and 490 nm. Endpoint titres were calculated as described elsewhere. 46 According to Frey et al.,46endpoint is de ned as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of a serum that gives a reading above the cutoff. This cutoff is established by the control sera from mock immunisation orunimmunised (true negative controls), ran at similar serial dilution of the same ELISA plate, and expressed as the SD multiplied by a factor based on the number of negative controls.-4-20246810121416 Energy ~50 + vaccine at 11200 J/m2 2 2 2 22 2 Area of circle = number of DEGs 500 1000 2000 Fig. 8 The average antibody endpoint titres (mean \u00b1 SEM), 21 days post intradermal immunisation, with the number of DEGs (area of circles) vs. various skin vaccination energies, 50, 3500 and 11,200 J/m2. ANOVA test was performed to HA-immunised samples ( p< 0.001, refer to Supplementary Fig. 9, experiments for antibody responses were ran for three separate experiments with n=4, 8 and 8)H.-I. Ng et al. 9 Published in partnership with the Sealy Center for Vaccine Development npj Vaccines (2019) 41 Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 7.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA, www.graphpad.com ). All data represented were expressed as the mean \u00b1 SEM, for trend observa- tions. The ANOVA was performed for multiple group comparison and two-tailed unpaired Student 'st-test was performed as appropriate with single comparison. A difference was considered statistically signi cant when p< 0.05. RNA extraction, puri cation and sequencing Ear skin samples were collected and stored at 80 \u00b0C until being processed. TissueRuptor \u00ae(9001274; Qiagen) was used to disrupt and homogenise skin in 1 ml of QIAzol Lysis Reagent. step (RNase-free DNAse set; 79254; Qiagen) according to manufacturer 's protocol. Purity and quality of RNA were validated by Nanodrop 1000 (ThermoScienti c) and 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent Technologies). RNA samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C until being processed. Complementary DNA libraries were made using TruSeq RNASample Preparation kit (RS122-2001/2; Illumina) and sequencing was run asa 50 bp single-end lane with at least 10 million read per sample on Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument performed by Australia Genome Research facility. The sequencing data described in this study are deposited in ArrayExpressaccession E-MTAB-7482. Sequence alignment, gene clustering and differential gene expression analysis Sequences were processed using Galaxy server, Genome Virtual Lab.47 Quality control of raw sequence data was determined using the Phred Score obtained from Fast QC package. Reads were above a Phred Score of 25. Read alignment and transcript quanti cation was performed using Salmon.48DESeq2 was used for differential gene expression analysis. Genes considered signi cantly regulated when p< 0.05. Gene set enrichment analysis Pre-ranked GSEA was performed following a standard procedure.49The gene signatures of Mosca et al. (E-TABM-506),18Caproni et al. (E-MATB- 942),19Li data. The top ~200 up or downregulated genes ineach condition (vs. unimmunised, unless otherwise speci ed) were identi ed by differential gene expression using GEOquery and Limma R packages from the Bioconductor project. Mice Entrez Gene IDs were mapped to Human Entrez Gene IDs for analysis, using the HGNC Comparison of Orthology Predictions (downloaded 07/09/2017). However,the comparison with Pearton et al. 21could not be performed due to the lack of microarray data. Weighed gene co-expression network analysis Regularised log-normalised expression data from RNA-seq experimentswere generated using the DESeq2 and batch correction was performedusing the ComBat package embedded within the surrogate variableanalysis package from the Bioconductor R project. 51A weighted gene network was generated from the data by following the standard procedureof the WGCNA package.52WGCNA provides a mean of identifying correlation patterns of genes across microarray or RNA-seq samples and subsequently nding modules of highly correlated genes/nodes via a hierarchical coupled with topology overlap matrix-based dissimilarity measure. WGCNA constructs networks using a scale-free topology criterion where connectivity of genes/nodes follows a powerlaw distribution where strongly connected gene -gene pairs are high- lighted, whereas weakly connected pairs are penalised. This was found to be useful for the identi cation of intrinsic biologically meaningful modules of co-ordinately expressed genes. 53Briefly, the similarity (concordance) between gene expression pro les across the samples was measured using Pearson 's correlations. The co-expression similarities are converted into connection strengths and used to de ne the distance (dissimilarity) between genes (or nodes). The WGCNA package uses the topological overlap dissimilarity measure, as it was found to result in biologically meaningful modules.53Genes with coherent expression pro les were grouped into modules using average linkage hierarchical clusteringcoupled with the topological overlap dissimilarity measure. The genemodules correspond to the branches of the resulting dendrogram. To identify modules that are signi cantly associated with external traits, the summary pro le (eigengene) of each module was correlated with prede ned external traits and looked for the most signi cant associations. According to the WGCNA package, the module eigengene is the representative value for a module and is de ned as the rst principal component of a module; the normalised linear combination of genes withthe maximum possible variability in a module. To facilitate biologicalinterpretation, pathway overrepresentation analysis for each MCPDB ). 54The top ve processes from KEGG and GO biological processes were reported. Top ten pathways hits from KEGG were plotted ontoGraphPad Prism. Heatmap Log2 normalised gene expression values for the respective genes were extracted from the expression matrix used for WGCNA analysis. The expression data were centred and scaled to a z-scale, which represents the expression values as SDs from the centre. The data were then converted toa colour scale from blue to white, to red, where blue indicates lowexpression and red indicates high expression. The heatmap was generatedusing the pheatmap R package.
