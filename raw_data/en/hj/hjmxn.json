That's where the vaccine comes in! So, if you're exposed to the real virus later, your immune system recognizes it and defends itself. The vaccine never enters the core of your cells where your DNA is - that's why the vaccine can't change your DNA in any way.Once inside your cells, the virus starts making lots of copies of itself. When there are too many of these copies, your cells can't work normally and you get sick. What is the updated vaccine?cellIts surface is covered in small bumps, called spike proteins that help it get into your cells. There's no real virus in the vaccine, so it can't give you COVID-19. The vaccine gives your immune system instructions for how to ght off the virus. (Your immune system is your body's natural defense system against getting sick.) This helps keep you from getting so sick that you have to go to the hospital, or so sick that you die. Published May 2023The updated vaccine (also called the bivalent vaccine) has been updated to help protect against new strains of COVID-19. The COVID-19 virus has changed over time. Most people are getting sick from these newer types of the virus, like the Omicron strain. "}
