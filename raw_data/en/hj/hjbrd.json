Many vaccines are being deployed to prevent coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) including two novel mRNA-based vaccines [1](#ref-1), [2](#ref-2). These vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies and appear to be safe and effective, but the precise nature of the elicited antibodies is not known [3](#ref-3)- [5](#ref-5). Here we report on the antibody and memory B cell responses in a cohort of 20 volunteers who received either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines. Consistent with prior reports, 8 weeks after the second vaccine injection volunteers showed high levels of IgM, and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S), receptor binding domain (RBD) binding titers [3](#ref-3), [5](#ref-5). Moreover, the plasma neutralizing activity, and the relative numbers of RBD-specific memory B cells were equivalent to individuals who recovered from natural infection [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7). However, activity against SARS-CoV-2 variants encoding E484K or N501Y or the K417N:E484K:N501Y combination was reduced by a small but significant margin. Consistent with these findings, vaccine-elicited monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) potently RBD epitopes epitopes in common with mAbs isolated from infected donors. Structural analyses of mAbs complexed with S trimer suggest that vaccine- and virus-encoded S adopts similar conformations to induce equivalent anti-RBD antibodies. However, neutralization by 14 of the 17 most potent mAbs tested was reduced or abolished by either K417N, or E484K, or N501Y mutations. Notably, the same mutations were selected when recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)/SARS-CoV-2 S was cultured in the presence of the vaccine elicited mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that the monoclonal antibodies in clinical use should be tested against newly arising variants, and that mRNA vaccines may need to be updated periodically to avoid potential loss of clinical efficacy. Between 19 October 2020 and 15 January 2021, 20 volunteers who received two doses of the Moderna (n=14) or Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA (n=6) vaccines were recruited for blood donation and analyzed. Ages of the analyzed volunteers ranged from 29-69 years (median 43); 12 (60%) were male and 8 (40%) female. 16 participants identified as Caucasian, 2 as Hispanic, and 1 as African American or Asian, respectively. The time from the second vaccination to sample collection varied between 3-14 weeks with an average of 8 weeks. None of the volunteers had a history of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and none experienced serious adverse events after vaccination (Extended Data Table 1). Vaccinee plasma binding and neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 Plasma IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 S by enzyme-linked (ELISA) [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7). All individuals tested showed reactivity to S and RBD that was significantly higher compared to pre-COVID-19 historic controls ( [Extended Data Fig 1](#F5)). As might be expected anti-S and -RBD IgG levels were higher than IgM or IgA. Moreover, there was greater variability in the anti-RBD than the anti-S response but the two were positively correlated ( [Extended Data Fig 1](#F5)). Plasma neutralizing activity was using HIV-1 pseudotyped with SARS-CoV-2 S protein [6](#ref-6)- [8](#ref-8). In agreement with previous reports, there was a broad range of plasma neutralizing activity 3-14 weeks after the second vaccine dose that was similar to that elicited by natural infection in a convalescent cohort after 1.3 months, and greater than the activity at 6.2 months after infection ( [Fig. 1a](#F1), Extended Data Table 1). There was no significant difference in neutralizing activity between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines ( [Fig. 1b](#F1)). As expected, and S binding, and neutralizing activities were directly correlated to the time between the first vaccine dose and blood donation with significantly reduced levels in all 3 measurements with time ( [Fig. 1e-g](#F1), and [Extended Data Fig. 2e-h](#F6)) [9](#ref-9). To determine whether plasma from vaccinated individuals can neutralize circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern and mutants that arise in vitro under antibody pressure [10](#ref-10), [11](#ref-11), we tested vaccinee plasma against a panel of 10 mutant pseudotype viruses including recently reported N501Y (B1.1.7 variant), K417N, E484K and the combination RBD mutations (501Y.V2 variant) [12](#ref-12)- [17](#ref-17). Vaccinee plasma was significantly less effective in neutralizing the HIV-1 virus pseudotyped with certain SARS-CoV-2 mutant S proteins ( [Fig. 1h and i](#F1) and [Extended Data Fig. 2j](#F6)). Among the volunteer plasmas tested there was an 1 to 3, 1.3 to 2.5, and 1.1 to 3 fold decrease in neutralizing activity against E484K, N501Y and the respectively, and i](#F1)). conclude that the plasma neutralizing activity elicited by mRNA vaccination is variably but significantly less effective against particular RBD mutants in the tested panel. Vaccine-elicited SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific monoclonal antibodies Although circulating antibodies derived from plasma cells wane over time, long-lived immune memory can persist in expanded clones of memory B cells [6](#ref-6). We used flow cytometry to enumerate the circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific memory B the percentage of RBD-binding memory B cells in vaccinees was significantly greater than in naturally infected individuals assayed after 1.3 months, but similar to the same individuals assayed after 6.2 months ( [Fig. 2b](#F2)). The percentage of RBD-binding memory B cells in vaccinees was not correlated to the time after vaccination ( [Extended Data Fig. 3c](#F7)). Thus, mRNA vaccination elicits a robust SARS-CoV-2 RBD-specific B cell memory response that resembles natural infection. To examine the nature of the antibodies produced by memory B cells in response to vaccination, we obtained 1,409 paired antibody heavy and light chains from RBD binding single B cells from 14 individuals (n=10 Moderna and n=4 Pfizer-BioNTech vaccinees) (Extended Data Table 2). Expanded clones of cells comprised 4-50% of the overall RBD binding memory B cell compartment ( [Fig. 2c and d](#F2), and [Extended Data Fig. 3d](#F7)). Similar to natural infection, IGVH 3-53, and 3-30 and some IGVL genes were significantly over-represented in the RBD-binding memory B cell compartment of vaccinated individuals ( [Fig. 2e](#F2), [Extended Data Fig. 4a](#F8)). In addition, antibodies that share the same combination of IGHV and IGLV genes in vaccinees comprised 39% ( [Extended Data Fig. 4b](#F8)) and infected individuals [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7) ( [Fig. 2f](#F2)), and some of these antibodies were nearly identical (Extended Data Table 2 and 3). The number of V gene nucleotide mutations in vaccinees is greater than in naturally infected individuals assayed after 1.3 months, but lower than that in the same individuals assayed after 6.2 months ( [Fig. 2g](#F2) and [Extended Data Fig. 5a](#F9)). The length of the IgH CDR3 was similar in both natural infected individuals and vaccinees and hydrophobicity was below average [18](#ref-18) Fig. 5a and b](#F9)). Thus, the IgG memory response is similar in individuals receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and both are rich in recurrent and clonally expanded antibody sequences. Eighty-four representative antibodies from 4 individuals were expressed and tested for reactivity to the RBD (Extended Data Table 4). The antibodies included: (1) 58 that were randomly selected from those that appeared only once, and (2) 26 representatives of expanded clones. Of the antibodies tested 99% (83 out of the 84) bound to RBD indicating that single cell sorting by flow cytometry efficiently identified B cells producing anti-RBD antibodies ( [Extended Data Fig. 6a](#F10) and [b](#F10) and Table 4). In anti-RBD ELISAs the mean half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was higher than that observed in infected individuals after 6 months but not significantly different from antibodies obtained 1.3 months after infection ( [Extended Data Fig. 6a](#F10), and Table 4 and [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7)). To examine memory B cell antibodies for binding to circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants and antibody resistant mutants we the antibodies showed at least 5-fold decreased binding to at least one of the mutant RBDs ( [Extended data Fig. 6c-l](#F10), and Table 4). SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotyped viruses were used to measure the neutralizing activity of all 84 antibodies [6](#ref-6)- [8](#ref-8) ( [Fig. 3a](#F3), Extended Data Table 4). Consistent with the plasma neutralization results, the geometric mean neutralization half-maximal inhibitory concentration of the vaccinee antibodies (IC50=151 ng/ml) was not significantly different to antibody collections obtained from naturally infected individuals 1.3 or 6.2 months after infection ( [Fig. 3a](#F3) and [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7)). To examine the neutralizing breadth of the monoclonal antibodies and begin to map their target epitopes we tested the 17 most potent antibodies (Extended data Table 5), 8 of which carried IgHV3-53, against a panel of 12 SARS-CoV-2 variants: A475V is resistant to class 1 antibodies (structurally defined as described [20](#ref-20)); E484K and Q493R are resistant circulating variants some of which have been associated with rapidly increasing case numbers [12](#ref-12), [13](#ref-13), [24](#ref-24)- [27](#ref-27). Based on their neutralizing activity against the variants, all but 3 of the antibodies were provisionally assigned to a defined antibody class or a combination ( [Fig. 3b](#F3)). As seen in natural infection, a majority of the antibodies tested (9/17) were at least ten-fold less effective against pseudotyped viruses carrying the E484K mutation [6](#ref-6), [10](#ref-10), [20](#ref-20). In addition, 5 of the antibodies were less potent against K417N and 4 against N501Y by ten-fold or more ( [Fig. 3b](#F3)). To determine whether antibody-imposed selection pressure could also drive the emergence of resistance mutations in vitro, we cultured an rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus in the presence of each of 18 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. All of the tested antibodies selected for RBD mutations. Moreover, in all cases the selected mutations corresponded to residues in the binding sites of their presumptive antibody class ( [Fig. 3b and c](#F3)). For example, antibody 627, which was assigned to class 2 based on sensitivity to E484K mutation, selected for the emergence of the E484K mutation in vitro ( [Fig 3c](#F3)). Notably, 6 of the antibodies selected for K417N E or T, 5 selected for E484K and 3 selected for N501Y, T or H, which coincide with mutations present in the circulating B1.1.17, 501Y.V2 and B1.1.28/501.V3 variants that have been associated with rapidly increasing case numbers in particular locales [12](#ref-12), [15](#ref-15), [17](#ref-17), [28](#ref-28). Cryo-EM mapping of antibody epitopes To further characterize antibody epitopes and mechanisms of neutralization, we characterized seven complexes between mAb Fab fragments and the prefusion, stabilized 4](#F4) Table 6). Overall resolutions ranged from 5-8 \u00c5 and coordinates from S trimer and representative Fab crystal structures were fit by rigid body docking into the cryo-EM density maps to provide a general assessment of antibody footprints/RBD epitopes. Fab-S complexes exhibited multiple RBD-binding from natural infection ( [Fig. 4o](#F4)) [20](#ref-20). The majority of mAbs characterized (6 of 7) recognized epitopes that included RBD residues involved in ACE2 recognition, suggesting a neutralization mechanism that directly blocks ACE2-RBD interactions. Additionally, structurally defined antibody epitopes were consistent with RBD positions that were selected in rVSV/SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus outgrowth experiments, including residues Taken together, these data suggest that functionally similar antibodies are raised during vaccination and natural infection, and that the RBDs of spike trimers translated from the mRNA delivered by vaccination adopt a similar distribution of 'up'/'down' conformations as observed on SARS-CoV-2 virions. Discussion The mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are safe and effective and being deployed globally to prevent infection and disease. The vaccines elicit antibody responses against the RBD, the major target of neutralizing antibodies [30](#ref-30)- [35](#ref-35), in a manner that resembles natural infection. Notably, the neutralizing antibodies produced by mRNA vaccination target the same epitopes as natural infection. The data is consistent with SARS-CoV-2 spike trimers translated from the injected RNA adopting the range of conformations available to spikes on the surfaces of virions. Moreover, different individuals immunized with either the Moderna (mRNA-1273) or Pfizer-BioNTech (BNT162b2) vaccines produce closely related and nearly identical antibodies. Human neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD can be categorized as belonging to 4 different classes based on their target regions on the RBD [20](#ref-20). Class 1 and 2 antibodies are among the most potent and also the most abundant antibodies [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7), [30](#ref-30), [31](#ref-31), [34](#ref-34). These antibodies target epitopes that or are closely associated with RBD residues K417, E484 and N501. They are frequently sensitive to mutation in these residues and select for K417N, E484K and N501Y mutations in both yeast and VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 S proteins [10](#ref-10), [13](#ref-13), [24](#ref-24). To avert selection and escape, antibody therapies should be composed of combinations of antibodies that target variants that have been associated with rapidly increasing case numbers and have particular prevalence in the UK (B1.1.7/501Y.V1), South Africa (501Y.V2) and Brazil (B1.1.28/501.V3) [12](#ref-12), [39](#ref-39). Our experiments indicate and potentially others that carry K417N/T, E484K and N501Y mutations, can reduce the neutralization potency of vaccinee plasma. The comparatively modest effects of the mutations on viral sensitivity to plasma reflects the polyclonal nature of the neutralizing antibodies in vaccinee plasma. Nevertheless, emergence of these particular variants is consistent with the dominance of the class 1 and 2 antibody response in infected or vaccinated individuals and raises the possibility that they emerged in response to immune selection in individuals with non-sterilizing immunity. What the long-term effect of accumulation of mutations on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic will be is not known, but the common cold coronavirus HCoV-229E evolves antigenic variants that are comparatively resistant to older sera but remain sensitive to contemporaneous sera [40](#ref-40). Thus, it is possible that these mutations and others that emerge in individuals with suboptimal or waning immunity will erode the effectiveness of natural and vaccine elicited immunity. The data suggests that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines may need to be updated and immunity monitored in order to compensate for viral evolution. Methods Data reporting No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized and the investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment. Study participants To isolate and characterize anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies from vaccinees, a cohort of 20 individuals that participated in either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech phase 3 vaccine clinical trials and did not report prior history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was recruited at the NIH Blood Center and the Rockefeller University Hospital for blood donation. Eligible participants included adults, at least 18 years of age with no known heart, lung, kidney disease or bleeding disorders, no history of HIV-1 or malaria infection. All participants were asymptomatic at the time of the study visit and had received a complete 2 dose regimen of either mRNA vaccine. Informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice. The study visits and blood draws were reviewed and approved under the National Institutes of Health's Federalwide Assurance (FWA00005897), in accordance with Federal regulations 45 CFR 46 and 21 CFR 5 by the NIH Intramural Research Program IRB committee (IRB# 99CC0168, Collection and Distribution of Blood Components from Healthy Donors for In Vitro Research Use) and by the Institutional Review Board of the Rockefeller University (IRB# DRO-1006, Peripheral Blood of Coronavirus Survivors to Identify Virus-Neutralizing Antibodies). For detailed participant characteristics see Extended Data Table SI 1. Blood samples processing and storage Samples collected at NIH were drawn from participants at the study visit and processed within 24 hours. Briefly, whole blood samples were subjected to Ficoll gradient centrifugation after 1:1 dilution in PBS. Plasma and PBMC samples were obtained through phase separation of plasma layer and Buffy coat phase, respectively. PBMCs were further prepared through centrifugation, red blood cells lysis and washing steps, and stored in CellBanker cell freezing media (Amsbio). All samples were aliquoted and stored at 80 \u00b0C and shipped on dry ice. Prior to experiments, aliquots of plasma samples were heat-inactivated (56\u00b0C for 1 hour) and then stored at 4\u00b0C. Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) obtained from samples collected at Rockefeller University were purified as previously reported [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7) by gradient centrifugation and stored in liquid nitrogen in the presence of FCS and DMSO. Heparinized plasma samples were aliquoted and stored at 20\u00b0C or less. Prior to experiments, aliquots of plasma samples were heat-inactivated (56\u00b0C for 1 hour) and then stored at 4\u00b0C. ELISAs ELISAs [41](#ref-41), [42](#ref-42) to evaluate antibodies S (BioHub), RBD and additional mutated RBDs were performed by coating of high-binding 96-half-well plates (Corning 3690) with 50 l per well of a 1g/ml protein solution in PBS overnight at 4 \u00b0C. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated with 170 l per well buffer (1\u00d7 PBS with 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween-20 (Sigma)) for 1 h at room temperature. Immediately after blocking, monoclonal antibodies or plasma samples were added in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Plasma samples were assayed at a 1:66.6 (RU samples) or a 1:33.3 (NIH samples) starting dilution and 7 additional threefold serial dilutions. Monoclonal antibodies were tested at 10 g/ml starting concentration and 10 additional fourfold serial dilutions. Plates were washed 6 times with washing buffer and then incubated with anti-human IgG, IgM or IgA secondary (Jackson Immuno Research 109-036-088 blocking buffer a 1:5,000 dilution (IgM and IgG) or 1:3,000 dilution (IgA). Plates were developed by addition of the HRP substrate, TMB (ThermoFisher) for 10 min (plasma samples) or 4 minutes (monoclonal antibodies), then the developing reaction was stopped by adding 50 l 1 M H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA microplate reader (FluoStar Omega, BMG Labtech) with Omega and Omega MARS software for analysis. For plasma samples, a positive control (plasma from participant COV72 [6](#ref-6), [7](#ref-7), diluted 66.6-fold and with seven additional threefold serial dilutions in PBS) was added to every assay plate for validation. The average of its signal was used for normalization of all of the other values on the same plate with Excel software before calculating the area under the curve using Prism V8.4 (GraphPad). For monoclonal antibodies, regression (GraphPad Prism V8.4). Expression of RBD vectors encoding the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 (GenBank [MN985325.1](/lookup/external-ref?link_type=GEN&access_num=MN985325.1&atom=%2Fbiorxiv%2Fearly%2F2021%2F01%2F19%2F2021.01.15.426911.atom); S protein residues Mu phosphatase signal peptide were previously described [21](#ref-21). Cells and viruses 293T/ACE2.cl22 and HT1080/ACE2.cl14 cells [8](#ref-8) were cultured in Dulbecco's Modified Medium supplemented (FBS) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. Cells were for contamination with mycoplasma or retroviruses. rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP chimeric virus stocks were generated by infecting 293T/ACE2.cl22 cells. Supernatant was harvested 1 day post infection (dpi), cleared of cellular debris, and stored at 80\u00b0C. A plaque purified variant designated rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 that encodes D215G/R683G substitutions was used in these studies [8](#ref-8). Selection and analysis of antibody escape mutations For the selection of monoclonal antibody-resistant spike variants, a rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP2E1 (for details see [8](#ref-8)) population containing 106 infectious units was incubated with of monoclonal antibodies (10 g/ml passage 10-40 g/ml for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. Then, the virus-antibody mixtures were incubated with 5\u00d7 105 293T/ACE2cl.22 cells in 6-well plates. At 1 day post infection media was replaced with fresh media containing the equivalent concentrations of antibodies. Supernatant was harvested 2 days after infection and 150 l of the cleared supernatant was used to infect cells for passage 2, while 150 l was subjected to RNA extraction and sequencing. For identification of putative antibody resistance mutations, RNA was extracted using NucleoSpin 96 Virus Core Kit (Macherey-Nagel). The RNA was reversed transcribed using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Millipore Sigma) was used for amplification of cDNA using primers flanking the S-encoding sequence. The PCR products were purified and sequenced as previously described [6](#ref-6), [10](#ref-10). Breifly, tagmentation reactions were using l Nextera TDE1 Tagment DNA enzyme (catalog no. 15027865), and 1.25 l TD Tagment DNA buffer (catalog no. 15027866; Illumina). Next, the DNA was ligated to unique i5/i7 barcoded primer combinations using XP (Agencourt), after which the samples were pooled into one library and subjected to paired-end sequencing using Illumina MiSeq Nano 300 V2 cycle kits (Illumina) at a concentration of 12pM. For analysis of the sequencing data, the raw paired-end reads were pre-processed to remove trim adapter sequences and to remove low-quality reads (Phred quality score < 20) using BBDuk. Reads were mapped to the rVSV/SARS-CoV-2/GFP sequence using Geneious Prime (Version 2020.1.2). Mutations were annotated using Geneious Prime, with a P-value cutoff of 10-6. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus A panel of plasmids expressing RBD-mutant SAR-CoV-2 spike proteins in the context of pSARS-CoV-2-S19 have been described previously [10](#ref-10). Additional substitutions were introduced using either PCR primer-mediated mutagenesis or with synthetic gene fragments (IDT) followed by Gibson assembly. The mutants E484K and KEN (K417N+E484K+N501Y) were constructed in the context of a pSARS-CoV-2-S19 variant with a mutation in the furin cleavage site (R683G). The NT50s and IC50 a wildtype SARS-CoV-2 (NC_045512) spike sequence carrying R683G in the subsequent analyses, as appropriate. Generation of SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 particles was performed as previously described [7](#ref-7). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected with pNL4-3DEnv-nanoluc and pSARS-CoV-2-S19 and pseudotyped virus stocks were harvested 48 hours after transfection, filtered and stored at 80\u00b0C. SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype neutralization assays Plasma or monoclonal antibodies from vaccine recipients were four-fold or five-fold serially diluted and then incubated with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped HIV-1 reporter virus for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The antibody and pseudeotype virus mixture was added to 293TAce2 cells [7](#ref-7) (for comparisons of plasma from COVID-19-convalescents and vaccine recipients) or HT1080ACE2.cl14 cells [8](#ref-8) (for analysis of spike mutants with vaccine recipient plasma or monoclonal antibodies). After 48 h cells were washed with PBS and lysed with Luciferase Cell Culture Assay System (Promega) with the Glomax Navigator (Promega). The relative luminescence units were normalized to those derived from cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus in the absence of plasma or monoclonal antibodies. The half-maximal neutralization titers for plasma (NT50) concentrations for monoclonal and IC90, respectively) were determined using four-parameter nonlinear regression bottom=0) (GraphPad Prism). Biotinylation of cytometry Purified and Avi-tagged SARS-CoV-2 RBD was biotinylated Ligase-BIRA instructions as described Ovalbumin (Sigma, A5503-1G) was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotinylation according to the manufacturer's (Thermo was single cell sorting Single-cell sorting by flow cytometry was performed as described previously [7](#ref-7). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were enriched for B cells by negative selection using a pan-B-cell isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Miltenyi Biotec, 130-101-638). The enriched B cells were incubated in FACS buffer (1\u00d7 PBS, 2% FCS, 1 mM EDTA) with following 423105) and fluorophore-labelled RBD and ovalbumin (Ova) for 30 min on ice. Single CD3-CD8-CD14-CD16-CD20+Ova-RBD-PE+RBD-AF647+ B cells were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates containing 4 l of lysis buffer (0.5\u00d7 PBS, mM DTT, 3,000 units/ml and FACSDiva software (Becton Dickinson) for acquisition and FlowJo for analysis. The sorted cells were frozen on dry ice, and then stored at 80 \u00b0C or immediately used for subsequent RNA reverse transcription. Antibody sequencing, cloning and expression Antibodies were identified and sequenced as described previously [7](#ref-7). In brief, RNA from single cells was reverse-transcribed (SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase, Invitrogen, 18080-044) and the cDNA stored at 20 \u00b0C or used for subsequent amplification of the variable IGH, IGL and IGK genes by nested PCR and Sanger sequencing. Sequence analysis was performed using MacVector. Amplicons from the first PCR reaction were used as templates for sequence- and ligation-independent cloning into antibody expression vectors. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies and Fabs were produced and purified as previously described [7](#ref-7). Cryo-EM sample preparation Expression and purification of SARS-CoV-2 6P stabilized S trimers [29](#ref-29) was conducted as previously described [43](#ref-43). Purified Fab and S 6P trimer were incubated at a 1.1:1 molar ratio per protomer on ice for 30 minutes prior to deposition on a freshly glow-discharged 300 mesh, 1.2/1.3 Quantifoil copper grid. Immediately before 3 l of complex was applied to the grid, fluorinated octyl-malotiside was added to the Fab-S complex to a final detergent concentration of 0.02% w/v, resulting in a final complex concentration of 3 mg/ml. Samples were vitrified in 100% liquid ethane using a Mark IV Vitrobot after blotting for 3 s with Whatman No. 1 filter paper at 22\u00b0C and 100% humidity. Cryo-EM data collection and processing Data collection and processing followed a similar workflow to what has been previously described in detail [20](#ref-20). Briefly, micrographs were collected on a Talos Arctica transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher) operating at 200 kV for all Fab-S complexes. Data were collected using SerialEM automated data collection software [44](#ref-44) and movies were recorded with a K3 camera (Gatan). For all datasets, cryo-EM movies were patch motion corrected for beam-induced motion including dose-weighting within cryoSPARC v2.15 [45](#ref-45) after binning super resolution movies. The non-dose-weighted images were used to estimate CTF parameters using cryoSPARC implementation of the Patch CTF job. Particles were picked using Blob picker and extracted 4x binned and 2D classified. Class averages corresponding to distinct views with secondary structure features were chosen and ab initio models were generated. 3D classes that showed features of a Fab-S complex were re-extracted, unbinned (0.869 \u00c5/pixel) and homogenously refined with C1 symmetry. Overall resolutions were reported based on gold standard FSC calculations. Cryo-EM Structure Modeling and Refinement Coordinates for initial complexes were generated by docking individual chains from reference structures into cryo-EM density using loops and converting to a polyalanine model). Models were then refined into cryo-EM maps by rigid body and real space refinement in Phenix [47](#ref-47) If the resolution allowed, partial CDR3 loops were built manually in Coot [48](#ref-48) and then refined using real-space refinement in Phenix. Computational analyses of antibody sequences Antibody sequences were trimmed based on quality and annotated using Igblastn v.1.14. with IMGT domain using Change-O toolkit v.0.4.540 [49](#ref-49). Heavy and light chains derived from the same cell were paired, and clonotypes were assigned based on their V and J genes using in-house R and Perl scripts ( [Extended data Fig. 2](#F6)). All scripts and the data used to process antibody sequences are publicly available on GitHub ( [https://github.com/stratust/igpipeline](https://github.com/stratust/igpipeline)). The frequency distributions of human V genes in anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies from this study was compared to 131,284,220 IgH and IgL sequences generated by [50](#ref-50) and downloaded from cAb-Rep [51](#ref-51), a database of human shared BCR clonotypes available at [https://cab-rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/](https://cab-rep.c2b2.columbia.edu/). Based on the 97 distinct V genes that make up the 4186 analyzed sequences from Ig repertoire of the 14 participants present in this study, we selected the IgH and IgL sequences from the database that are partially coded by the same V genes and counted them according to the constant region. The frequencies shown in ( [Fig 2e](#F2) and [Extended Data Fig 3a](#F7)) are relative to the source and isotype analyzed. We used the two-sided binomial test to check whether the number of sequences belonging to a specific IgHV or IgLV gene in the repertoire is different according to the frequency of the same IgV gene in the database. Adjusted p-values were calculated using the false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Significant differences are denoted with stars. Nucleotide somatic hypermutation and CDR3 length were determined using in-house scripts. For somatic hypermutations, IGHV and IGLV nucleotide sequences were closest germlines using Igblastn and the number of differences were considered nucleotide mutations. The average mutations for V genes were calculated by dividing the sum of all nucleotide mutations across all participants by the number of sequences used for the analysis. To calculate the GRAVY scores of hydrophobicity [52](#ref-52) we used Guy H.R. Hydrophobicity scale based on free energy of transfer (kcal/mole) [53](#ref-53) implemented by the R package Peptides (the Comprehensive R Archive Network repository; [https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-001/RJ-2015-001.pdf](https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2015/RJ-2015-001/RJ-2015-001.pdf)). We used 1409 heavy chain CDR3 amino acid sequences from this study and 22,654,256 IGH CDR3 sequences from the public database of memory B cell receptor sequences [54](#ref-54). The two-tailed Wilcoxon nonparametric test was used to test whether there is a difference in hydrophobicity distribution. Data availability statement Data are provided in SI Tables 1-8.
