Stress and worry caused by the pandemic, along with bad habits like drinking too much, smoking too much, and eating unhealthy foods, have put a lot of people at risk for heart diseases. Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest health sciences, and it has a lot of natural treatments that can help avoid and even cure heart diseases. Read on to learn more about how Ayurveda can help you take care of your heart health. Four ways Ayurvedic drugs can help the heart There are many Ayurvedic treatments for heart disease. Your Ayurvedic practitioner will tell you which one is best for you based on the type and seriousness of your heart disease. Here are some of the most common ways that Ayurveda for the heart works to avoid and treat heart diseases. 1. Therapies that help the heart: Ayurvedic therapies like Panchakarma, Yoga, Pranayama, and meditation can help improve Agni (the digestive fire), clear channels, affect the nervous system, lower stress, clear the body's energy pathways, encourage the healthy flow of Prana, and improve the body's health. Here are some of the benefits of the most popular therapies used to help the heart. Ayurvedic practitioners think that all diseases are caused by a lack of digestive fire (Agnimandya). Panchakarma processes, which help clear the body's channels, improve Agni (the digestive fire), and get rid of toxins, can improve the health of the heart and the body as a whole. Pranayama: Pranayama brings life back into the body's energy pathways and calms and cleans the mind. Also, if you do yoga every day, it can slow down your heart rate and lower your blood pressure. Yoga: Doing yogic exercises helps move Prana around the body, improves blood flow, and is a good way to get some exercise. Meditation and prayer: Praying and meditating regularly can help you become more aware, keep your thought habits stable, and feel better about yourself. Practitioners of Ayurveda think that regularly praying and meditating can lower stress, improve your heart rate, and lower your blood pressure. Meditation can also make you less likely to have a stroke or develop diabetes. 2. Changes to the diet: To make sure your heart works well and your body is in good shape, you need to improve your Agni (digestive fire). You can do this by eating Ayurvedic foods for heart disease, such as whole foods and veggies and fruits that are in season. Ayurveda also sees eating as a sacred act, so practitioners often tell patients to eat slowly and carefully until they are full. 3. Herbal remedies: Ayurvedic drugs for the heart try to fix health problems by going after the disease's root cause. Ayurvedic doctors treat heart problems by using a mix of current medical science and natural herbs and ingredients to treat the root causes of the problem. Some strong heart medicine Amala, Haridra, Arjuna, and Ashwagandha are all types of Ayurvedic medicine and ingredients that are often suggested for improving circulation, lowering cholesterol, and making the heart work better. 4.Doshas in balance: Kapha, Vata, and Pitta are the three main Doshas. If there is too much Kapha in the body, it could lead to high cholesterol and clots in the heart. In the same way, too much Vata could raise blood pressure. High Pitta can make the heart beat less often. By living an Ayurvedic lifestyle and eating right, you can keep the Doshas in balance and protect your heart health. Ayurveda's benefits for the heart Here are some of the most important reasons to use Ayurveda to treat heart problems: Lowers cholesterol and blood pressure: An Ayurvedic treatment for heart disease, ways to deal with stress, and a healthy diet can help stop plaque from building up. This lowers LDL cholesterol and makes the blood flow better. Cleanses the body: Ayurvedic practises, such as Panchakarma, get rid of toxins that stop the body from working properly. This method also helps lower high blood pressure, eases chest pain, and calms the nervous system, all of which are good for the health of the heart. Lowers inflammation: Bad eating habits, poor digestion, and not getting enough or regular sleep can all cause inflammation, which is the root cause of many heart problems and other health problems. Ayurvedic methods that make the body stronger and keep the Doshas in balance can help reduce inflammation. Helps you lose weight: If you eat and live according to Ayurvedic rules, you will lose weight. This can help lower blood pressure, make the heart pump better, speed up the metabolism, and make the blood vessels healthier.
