She has practiced in multiple focal areas to include bariatric surgery, family medicine, and urgent care. As an officer in the United Stated Air Force, she also received specialty training in behavioral health, trauma, and occupational medicine. In addition, she holds a master's degree in Acupuncture from the Maryland University of Integrative Health. Ashley Drapeau is a Physician Assistant at the George Washington Resiliency and Well-being center. Beginning her career in Bariatric surgery, Ashley experienced a collaborative patient care environment and saw how the multi-disciplinary approach to treatment improved patient outcomes. She uses this experience along with her Eastern medical training to comprehensively treat the whole person. Through her training, specifically in acupuncture, Ashley learned a wide range of healing and self-cultivation techniques that could be applied to the overall health of her patients. Drawing from her own battle with Long Covid, she became passionate about the role of integrative medicine in the healing of complex conditions. Ashley approaches all patients with an empathetic, open mind creating space for them to share their experiences. She focuses on their individual goals and motivations for treatment. She deeply understands the importance of access to both conventional and complementary medicine. She is excited to join the multi-disciplinary GW Center for Integrative Medicine team to serve the needs of each unique individual. Ashley is grateful to be a part of a collaborative community that values integrative, not alternative medicine along with treating the whole person. Ashley specializes in long covid, gender dysphoria, ME/CFS, POTS, migraines, fibromyalgia, and cosmetic acupuncture/microneedling. In her spare time, she enjoys volunteering for the Tragedy Assistance Program for Survivors (TAPS) and advocating for her colleagues serving on her professional organizations. Testimonials: I am only starting at GW Center for Integrative Medicine on my process of dealing with long-COVID. I am undergoing what is for me an unlivable, unbelievably difficult situation. And even now, at the very beginning before I have any diagnosis or potential solutions/mitigations/approaches, I am giving them 5 stars because of Ashley Drapeau. I could never express in this review how much I appreciate this doctor (PA). I could never have asked for a better provider and I am effortlessly (and admittedly desperately) giving over my entire self and care to her because I trust her beyond words. Her expertise and knowledge are unparalleled, alongside a humility towards what she doesn't know, alongside an empathic, loving manner that I've never found before in a provider. If there is anyone that can help me get my life back, I believe it is her. - Steve M., "}
