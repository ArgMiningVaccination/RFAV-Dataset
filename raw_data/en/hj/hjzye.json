In several diseases, imbalance at the cellular level, organ level or system level where Ayurveda strives to bring back the balance of the affected cells, organs, systems by using dietary and lifestyle modifications, herbs, minerals, detoxification protocols (Panchakarma) etc Ayurveda restores balance to the physiology of the body.
