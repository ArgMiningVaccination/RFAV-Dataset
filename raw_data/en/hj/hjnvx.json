Southern Crescent Technical Colleg e strives to provide the most up -to-date curriculum that will meet the needs of graduates that enter the workforce. To accomplish this mission, curriculum changes are needed on occasion. Please refer to the latest catalog/handbook addendum for an update on all curriculum changes. All diploma and degree programs and some certificate programs require both general core and technical core classes. Please note that general core classes may be added or deleted due to the availability of properly credentialed in structors in these subject areas. Southern Crescent Tec hnical College will offer the minimum required general core classes, so students will be able to complete a program of study in a timely manner. In addition, the College will offer as many general core choices and options as instructor availability allows. Program Length The estimated length for most Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree programs is approximately two years, or eight quarters. The estimated length for most Diploma programs is ap prox imately eighteen months, or six quarters in length. *Note: Estimated program length reflects full -time enrollment and does not include learning support classes or delays due to course offerings, waiting lists, cohorts, or competitive admissions, etc . 11 SOUTHERN CRESCENT TE CHNICAL COLLEGE QUARTER TO SEMESTER CONVERSION Special Information for 2010 Students: If you're enrolling with us in the Fall of 2010, you'll likely be transitioning with Southern Crescent Technical College and the entire Technical College System of Georgia (TCSG) as we convert to a semester calendar, beginning in August 2011. You're probably already familiar with the semester calendar, so it won't be something new to you. It's a great move for our system and our students as we align with other colleges and universities in Georgia and across the country. Why semesters? The semester system offers many advantages to our students. The new academic calendar will: Align our calendar with 80 percent of other colleges and universities, and even with the K -12 system; Make it easier to transfer to other colleges and universities; Increase instructional time for mastery of course material; Improve scheduling for joint and dual enrollment high school students; and Provide more time for learning experiences like clinicals and internships. How will this change affect you? If you will graduate before August 2011, you will not be affected by the change to semesters. If you enroll in 2010 and will not graduate before August 20 11, you'll begin on the quarter system and will make the change to semesters. Beginning in August 2010 and continuing throughout the year, college advisors will be working with transitional students to ensure a smooth conversion. You should plan to meet with your advisor to review the credit conversion schedule and receive a personal academic plan to complete your program under semesters. We are committed to your education Southern Crescent Technical College is committed to serving and educating you at t he highest level of excellence. The conversion from quarters to semesters is a change that reflects our goal to provide you with seamless education in Georgia and the most advanced training, education, and workforce preparation possible. The guiding prin ciple of the semester conversion process is that every effort will be made to see that you will be successfully transitioned with as minimal disruption as possible to your coursework during the changeover. To support this commitment, each SCTC transitiona l student will have a personal advising session to guide them through the conversion. At that meeting, you will receive an academic plan for your program under semesters. How should you prepare? If you'll be making the change from quarters to semesters, contact your advisor to create an academic plan that will guide you through the semester transition. For more information To learn more about the quarter to semester conversion, talk with your advisor or log on to www.TCSGSemester411.com. 12 Accounting AC02 The Diploma Program The Accounting diploma program is a sequence of courses designed to prepare students for careers in the accounting profession.

Upon successful completion (or transfer in) of ENG 1010, PSY 1010, BUS 1130, SCT 100, AHS 104, AHS 109, MAT 1012 , and AHS 1011 with a C or better and a grade point average of 2.5 or higher, the student will be program ready and eligible for admission into the Medical Assisting program based on submissio n of yellow program sheet , available classroom space, and available clinical sites. In the event that two or more applicants complete requirements simultaneously, the latest program application date will determine placement on the list. Math courses are not transferable into the Medical Assisting program. 6. Withdrawal from any MAS program class constitutes withdrawal from the program for that quarter. If a student withdraws for any reason, the student may be allowed to re-enter a cohort class at th e point he/she withdrew from the program, provided the student demonstrates proficiency. This courtesy is extended only once. Readmission into the Medical Assisting program following withdrawal or first time failure will be based on the following: *Success ful completion of written comprehensive examinations for each previously completed Medical Assisting course with a minimum competency of 80%; *Successful completion of a comprehensive lab skills check off with a minimum of 85%. Deficiencies will result in the student repeating course(s). Upon readmission into the Medical Assisting program, the student must complete additional requirements as deemed necessary by the program faculty. Readmission will be based on availability within the classroom setting and c linical sites. This courtesy is extended only once. Students who do not successfully complete the Medical Assisting program after two attempts, whether at Southern Crescent Technical College or at another college, will not be readmitted into the program. 7. Transferring Medical Assisting students from other technical colleges must make application and submit official transcripts to Griffin Technical College. Each Medical Assisting course listed in the transferring student's official transcript will be con sidered for transfer credit after transferring student has demonstrated proficiency by examination as noted above in # 6 with the exception of MAS 108 and MAS 109. MAS 108 and MAS 109 are not transferrable into the Medical Assisting program . 8. Medical co urses and some others have a transfer/readmittance life of five years. Withdrawn students or transfer -in students who desire admittance within five years must meet current admissions and curriculum requirements and will be admitted following the demonstrat ion of competencies as noted above in #6, submission of a yellow program sheet, and classroom and clinical site availablility . 9. Documentation of a physical and dental examination is turned in during the first MAS quarter with an accompanying drug screen and background check. 65 Approximate additional costs other than tuition, fees, and textbooks: Uniforms $200 Equipment/supplie s $50 National Registry varies - dependent on exam(s) taken Liability standards for Medical Assisting courses are very stringent. For students to progress to the next course of study, a minimum grade of C must be maintained. Students who are unsuccessful after a second attempt at courses within the Medical Assisting curriculum will be advised to choose another program of study. A student who has been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor may be admitted to the Medical Assistin g program ; however, such a conviction may prohibit a student from attending certain clinical sites and/or taking the Registry/Certification Examination. Documentation of satisfying the penalty of the felony must be presented to the National Boards with ap plication . Permission to sit for the examination rests solely with the National Board.
