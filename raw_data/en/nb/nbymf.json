Do you have questions about [naturopathic medicine's legitimacy](http://chwbonline.com/medical-services/naturopathic-medicine/)? Or wonder how effective it really is? Then keep reading to learn about its history and benefits! Naturopathic Family Medicine Naturopathic medicine [dates back](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6917424/) to the 1600s. European doctors used herbal and traditional medicine to treat illness. The first school of naturopathy was the American School of Naturopathy in New York. This school was founded by Dr. Benedict Lust. Naturopathic medicine uses and studies the healing powers of nature. Naturopathic medicine's goal is to use natural treatment. As well as use the least invasive and toxic therapies as possible. Naturopathic medicine views your body as a whole. It gives you the tools to live a life of wellness using your body's wisdom. Six Principles of Naturopathic Medicine There are six principles of Naturopathic medicine that are used around the world: First, you do no harm. The foundation of all medical practice is to help people as humans and the human condition. And to approach patient care in the most natural, least invasive way possible. Next is to realize the healing power of nature. Naturopathic doctors use substances directly from nature and the environment to fight disease. They recognize your body's wisdom to know how to heal itself. Then you have to identify and treat the causes. Improving symptoms is essential! But the most important thing is figuring out the underlying cause. Then you can move towards a cure. Naturopathic medicine believes that your doctor is your teacher. Naturopathic doctors are on your team and aim to help you better understand how to stay well. The belief is a relationship based on trust will lead to improved health. You have to treat the whole person! Naturopathy understands how connected our body is with our environment and lifestyle. The only way you can restore this connection is through a balanced approach. Finally, naturopathy believes that the prevention of illness and suffering is the key. If you stay balanced and understand your body's healing powers, you will be more able to get well and stay well. Naturopath vs. Functional Medicine Functional medicine looks [ for the root cause](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/departments/functional-medicine/about) of disease. Functional medicine encourages a partnership between you and your doctor. Functional medicine addresses you as a whole person, not just a box of symptoms. Functional medicine was established in 1991 by Dr. Jeffrey Bland when he started the Institute of Functional Medicine. It has its own seven fundamental principles, which include: - Functional medicine is science-based medicine. - Functional medicine focuses on genetic and environmental differences - Functional medicine focuses on patient-centered care - Balances external and internal factors - Believes in interconnectedness - Health is positive and not just the absence of disease - Attempts to enhance your lifespan Naturopathic and functional medicine are similar in the way they approach the treatment of the whole person. And not only their symptoms. What sets these two apart is how they approach the healing power of nature. Naturopathic medicine practitioners support your body's natural ability to heal itself. Naturopathic medicine is interested in your lifestyle and environment. And how that contributes to your health. Functional medicine is more about germs, microbes, and getting rid of the disease. Functional medicine practitioners will perform more functional testing. They will order laboratory tests, X-rays, or CT scans to determine the root cause of what is making you sick.
