{"title": "The Effect of Information Spreading on Vaccination Game-Based on SEIR/VA Model", "author": "Cheng Luo; Haoran Su; Boyu Ren; Zhiqiang Gou; Ruoyi Huang; Ya Li", "url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9776021", "hostname": "ieee.org", "description": "The development of social media has made the dissemination of information more convenient, which means part of people can gather more information and then change their behaviors. In other words, information spreading would effect disease-control. To investigate the effect of information on vaccination game, an epidemic SEIR/VA (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed-vaccinated-avoided) model and a combined strategy-updating rule are proposed. Besides, temporary protective measures triggered by information are used to reflect the role of information dissemination. Based on the mean field approximation theory, differential equations are established to study the effect of information and vaccination coverage as well as vaccination efficacy under mandatory policy. Then, considering payoff and peer pressure, differential equations are developed to characterize the change of vaccination rate over time and the results of the final epidemic size as well as mean social payoff corresponding to different vaccine cost and efficiency. It can be observed that individuals with information obtained become more sensitive to the price and utility of vaccines. Scilicet, only when the vaccine is effective and cheap enough, information spreading can promote individual to take vaccination, which in turn eliminates the disease. Otherwise, as information spreads, people become more reluctant to get vaccinated. In other words, information dissemination is a double-edged sword.", "sitename": "ieeexplore.ieee.org", "date": "2023-09-10", "cleaned_text": "A not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\u00a9 Copyright 2023 IEEE - All rights reserved.
