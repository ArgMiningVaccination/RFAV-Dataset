CIII Summary 7 Summary Background Modern medicine offers a multitude of evidence -based treatments for many chronic diseases. As a result, the prescription of multiple medications to treat one or more conditions in the same patient has become increasingly common, especially in the elderly. Even when prescribed according to bes t evidence , this polypharmacy is asso ciated with various risks, such as medication errors and non -adherence, leading to adverse drug reactions and drug - drug -interactions, outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and increased costs. The most recent definition describes medication adherence as \"the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed, composed of initiation, implementation and discontinuation\". Each component (initiation, implementation, and discontinuation ) describes different aspects of adherence and requires specific approaches for its management. Various direct and indirect methods measure adherence with differing validity, reliability, and potential bias . Electronic monitoring has been described as gold -standard especially during t he implementation phase because of high resolution and low intrusiveness. Electronic monitoring of polypharmacy is possible by repackaging all suitable medications into unit -of-use portions and monitoring each dosing time. Over the past decades, over all a dherence to medication has been reported to average around 50% - 75% across various conditions and settings. Non -adherence may be the principal reason for gaps between efficacy and effectiveness of treatments. Due to negative outcomes of non -adherence, such as increased morbidity, mortality, and costs, the improvement of medication adherence has been a focus for the World Health Organization since 2003. Medication adherence is not a stable personality trait but a complex behavior influenced by discrete factors. Various theoretical models aimed to explain non- adherence. Determinants of non- adherence are often grouped in five dimensions: patient -related, social/economic, health system/healthcare team, condition -related, and therapy -related factors. Polypharmac y may cause non -adherence because of pill burden alone, but dosing frequency and regimen complexity have also been described to negatively affect adherence. Recently, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was developed to simplify the investigation of be haviors such as adherence and to facilitate intervention design. Interventions to improve adherence are diverse, often complex, and show inconsistent results. Research about interventions addressing barriers associated with polypharmacy is Summary 8 scarce. Reducing pill burden or the frequency of medication intake may improve adherence; however, this approach is not always feasible. Medication management aids (MMA) are widely used tools to overcome challenges with complex regimens . MMAs are used to organize oral and solid medications by day and time, to act as visual reminders, and to provide visual adherence feedback. They can either be filled by the patients themselves, by a caregiver, or are supplied pre -packed by the pharmacy. Apart from the visual cue to take their medication, more advanced electronic MMAs (e-MMAs) may offer more explicit reminders, such as visual or audible alerts. Electronic monitoring can be used to provide customized feedback. Various e-MMAs for polypharmac y exist, but only few studies using these devices have been published. Pharmacists as suppliers of medications with frequent patient contact are in a unique position to interview patients about barriers to treatment and to offer individual support to enhan ce their adherence. Throughout the past century, the role of community pharmacists has shifted from a product -centered role to a provider of patient -centered services. Key objective is to improve the patient's health by promoting a rational use of medications ; a practice often referred to as \" pharmaceutical care\" (PhC). The m anagement of polypharmacy and medication adherence represent important aspects of pharmaceutical care. With the emergence of other terms describing medicines -related patient care, subst antial confusion remains about what PhC includes and how to differentiate it from other terms. In Switzerland, pharmacists provide various services related to polypharmacy and medication management reimbursed by health insurances, such as pharmacy -filled MMAs or a structured medication review. Goal The goal of this thesis w as to investigate adherence to polypharmacy from a pharmaceutical care perspective . This goal was approached by a) re-defining pharmaceutical care; b) evaluating the prevalence of the prescription of split preparations for elderly patients; c) exploring the use of a remote e-MMA for prepackaged polypharmacy in primary care patients; and d ) investigating the congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions in published trials. Summary 9 Overview of the projects Project A Project A aimed to review existing definitions of PhC and to describe the process of developing a redefined definition. A literature search was conducted to identify existing definitions of PhC. To ease comparison between definitions, we developed a standardized syntax to paraphrase the definitions. The literature search identified 19 definitions that were paraphrased using the standardized syntax (provider, recipient, subject, outcome, activities). During a dedicated meeting, a moderated discussion about the definition of PhC was organized. Twenty -four experts defined PhC as \"the pharmacist's contribution to the care of individuals in order to optimize medicines use and improve health outcomes.\" Project B Project B aimed to analyz e the prescription patterns of split tablets in general and of quetiapine in particular. Orders from 29 community pharmacies for unit -of-use soft pouch blisters for 1,321 patients residing in 53 retirem ent homes in northwestern Switzerland were analyzed. Out of 4,784,999 tablets that were repacked in 2012 in unit -of-use pouch blisters, 8.5% were fragmented . The patients were on average 81.5 years old and obtained 1.7 fragments. A total of 43.7% of patien ts received two or more fragments. The fragments concerned 132 different active substances, and 50% of them were psycholeptics or psychoanaleptics. The most often split tablets were preparations levodopa/decarboxylase inhibitor half quetiapine tablets appear ed to be constricted to the region of Basel . Project C For Project C , we investigated an e -MMA for pharmacy -filled blister pouches, which has been developed in the Netherlands and is currently marketed by Philips\u00ae. Project C1 aimed to collect opinions on MMAs in general and on the abovementioned e -MMA in particular . The study involved a 14 -day trial with the e -MMA and a focus group to identify general attributes of MMAs, their appli cability to the e -MMA, and possible target groups for the e -MMA. Six participants using long -term polypharmacy and willing to try new technologies completed the 14 -day trial and participated in the focus group. Participants rated ten of 17 general attributes as clearly applicable to the e -MMA and five as unsuitable. Attributes pertained to three interrelat ed themes: product design, patient support, and living conditions. Envisaged target groups were patients with time- sensitive medication regimens, patients with Summary 10 dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together to prevent accidental intake of the wrong medication. A potential target group might be o lder opioid -dependent patients : They often suffer from chronic diseases and disability in a ddition to their opioid dependence. As a result, they often need to deal with polypharmacy and complex regimens. Together with a high prevalence of psychological problems and low social support, these patients are at high risk for medication non- adherence, especially during the implementation phase. E -MMA s might be feasible to simultaneously monitor and improve implementation of dosing regimens for these patients. Thus, Project C2 aimed to describe the demographics of patients on opioid -assisted treatment (OAT) from an Outpatient Addiction Service (OAS) in Basel, Switzerland. Additionally, we aimed to assess the numbers and nature of medications dispensed to patients of the OAS with a focus on opioid substitution treatments, methylphenidate, and treatments for other comorbidities . We performed a longitudinal observational study with historical data recorded between 2002 and 2013. During the study period , the number of patients increased from 112 to 154. Mean age rose from 37.1 to 45.0 years. Alongside, the number of active ingredients per patient increased from 2.71 to 3.55 . The proportion of patients receiving 3 or more substances increased from 40% to almost 60%. Most substances were used in the therapeutic area of the nervous system, which includes all su bstitution medications and methylphenidate preparations. Methadone remained the predominant substance for OAT , but its use declined by 25%. Most of this proportion was replaced by sustained -release Morphine preparations. Methylphenidate prescriptions decli ned from 21.4% in 2002 to 16.9% in 2013. Short -acting preparations were fully replaced by long - acting formulations. These results confirmed the increasing age and use of polypharmacy for opioid -dependent patients of the OAS . Based on th ese information , we implemented a novel remote electronic medication supply model with the e -MMA in collaboration with the OAS and the emergency pharmacy in Basel, Switzerland. In Project C3, we report the first long -term experiences with the novel supply model for two opioi d-dependent patients with HIV. John (beginning dementia, 52 years, 6 tablets daily at 12 am) and Mary (frequent drug holidays, 48 years, 5 -6 tablets daily at 8 pm) suffered from disease progression due to non -adherence. We electronically monitored adherenc e and clinical outcomes during 659 (John) and 953 (Mary) days between July 2013 and April 2016. Both patients retrieved over 90% of the pouches within 75 minutes of the scheduled time. Technical problems occurred in 4% (John) and 7.2% (Mary) of retrievals but Summary 11 on-site support was seldom required. Viral loads fell below detection limits during the entire observation period. Project C4 aimed to evaluate for the first time a quantitative and qualitative (mixed -method) single -case study design to investigate th e use of the e- MMA in other patients on OAT with polypharmacy. Five patients from the OAS participated in a sequential multiple- baseline single subject study. Adherence was monitored with the e -MMA during a baseline phase. An intervention phase with built -in audible and visual reminders from the e -MMA started response -guided after at least 4 weeks of baseline measurement of adherence. After completion, participants entered a follow -up phase with or without the e -MMA. Participants (three females, 2 males) had a mean age of 48 years (34 -68), took on average 7 medications during 3 dosing times per day (excluding OAT), and spent on average 70% (30%-100%) of their weekdays at home. Participants were followed for an average of 160 days (39 -253, IQR = 87). E lectronic monitoring covered 85.5% of the observation period (80.4%-93.5%, IQR = 5.3). Three participants completed the whole study. An intervention phase with intake reminder s was implemented for two patients, the others did not use the built -in reminders . During the entire study period, overall taking adherence was 88%. Participants retrieved on average 61% of pouches within the dosing intervals (regular dispense), 26% more than 75 minutes before the agreed dosing times (pre -dispense), and 9.2% more than 75 minutes after the agreed dosing time (missed dispense). Errors during dispense occurred in 2.8% of retrievals. Taking adherence increased by more than 25% to almost 100% for both participants when audible and visual reminders were introduced during the intervention phase. The built -in reminders of the e -MMA reduced missed doses to zero, compared to 15% missed doses without the built -in reminders. The average time variability of retrieval (t Var) was 88 \u00b1 33 minutes and did not change with the built -in rem inders . Clinical and humanistic outcomes did not change during the study period for all participants. Participants generally accepted the e- MMA, especially for the security of having enough medication at home, the possibility to pre -dispense pocket -doses, and the assurance of regular intakes. Finally, in Project C5, we aimed to perform a cost -of-illness (COI) evaluation of patients receiving OAT and polypharmacy, and to compare the novel electronic medication supply model to usual care (base case) . We esti mated COI from a societal perspective for eligible patients of the OAS during one year. Total yearly COI per patient was 109'611 Swiss Francs (SFr), with direct costs accounting for 30% of the total costs. With the novel supply model, total yearly costs pe r patient increased by SFr 2'509 for repackaging of medication, leasing of the e -MMA, and time spent for travel, refill, and support (+ 2.2% compared to base case). Summary 12 Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust and overall costs did not substant ially change with various estimations. Project D Despite much research, interventions aimed at improving medication adherence report disappointing and inconsistent results. A potential explanation might b e that approaches seldom match interventions and pat ient determinants of non- adherence in clinical trials. Consequently, we aimed to assess congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions in Project D . Common categories shared by patient determinants of non - adherence and interventions have never been proposed. In Project D1 , we aimed at retrieving potential interventions and patient determinants from published literature on medication adherence, match them like locks and keys, and categorize them according to the TDF. We extracted 103 interventions and 42 determinants that we divided in 26 modifiable and 16 unmodifiable determinants. All interventions and modifiable matched ( knowledge; role and identity; pabilities; beliefs about consequences; i ntentions; memory, attention and decision processes; environmental context and resources; s ocial influences; emotion; and b ehavioral regulation). In Project D2 , we applied the results from P roject D1 to a Cochrane database with 190 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on adherence -enhancing interventions. We developed a congruence score consisting of 6 features related to inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline, and intervention design. We correlated overall congruence score and individual features with intervention effects regarding adherence and clinical outcomes. The inclusion of non -adherent patients was the single feature significantly associated with effective adherence interventions (p = 0.003). Moreover, effective adherence interventions were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes (p < 0.0001). However, neither the overall congruence score, nor any other individual feature (i.e. \"determinants of non - adherence as inclusion crite ria\", \"tailoring of interventions to the inclusion criteria\", \"reasons for non -adherence assessed at baseline\", \"adjustment of intervention to individual patient needs\", and \"theory based interventions\") were significantly associated with intervention effects. Summary 13 Conclusions In conclusion, the thesis showed: It was possible to paraphrase definitions of PhC using a standardized syntax focusing on the provider, recipient, subject, outcomes, and activities of PhC practice. During a one-day workshop, experts in PhC research agreed on a definition, intended to be applicable for the present time, representative for various work settings, and valid for countries in - and outside of Europe. Tablet splitting is a pharmaceutical care issue with pote ntial consequences on adherence, which play s a major role in dosage adjustments for geriatric patients. Although limited to certain regions, fragments of certain tablets are prescribed against the recommendations from the manufacturer. Pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to introduce new strengths to an existing range of products, in view of an optimization of care. If splitting tablets is necessary, pat ient counseling is recommended and pharmacies should deliver the appropriate tools or offer repackaging into MMAs for patients. The appearance of MMA s, but also its functionality and the whole medication supply process play an important role with regards t o the design and targeting of MMAs . In a focus group discussion, the evaluated e -MMA with pre -packaged polypharmacy met the majority of the requirements set to an MMA. Patients' living conditions like mobility remain the key determinants for their acceptan ce of the e- MMA. Especially patients with time -sensitive medication regimens, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together might benefit from the e- MMA. With our database analysis, we confirmed the globally observed shift towards an older population with OAT in a Swiss setting. An increase in the number of substances and medications might lead to an increased risk for drug -drug interactions, adve rse events , and non- adherence. Traditional OAT with liquid Methadone is increasingly being replaced by solid formulations such as Buprenorphine and sustained -release Morphine. Other disorders further complicate the safe and effective therapy of the se complex patient s. Taken together, the developments of the past 10 years call for new care models for older patients with OAT . The increasing age and the complexity of their medication might warrant a closer collaboration of health care professionals. Alternative supply m odels to assist patients with their medication management and to support medication adherence are needed in particular for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy. Summary 14 Continuous medication supply and persistence with treatment over more than 1.7 years, timin g adherence of more than 90%, and suppressed HIV viral load are first results from two case reports supporting the feasibility of a novel supply model with an e -MMA for opioid -dependent patients with polypharmacy. The use of a mixed -method single -subject d esign showed promising results for the evaluation of an e -MMA for polypharmacy. Our pilot study showed that the e -MMA may ensure correct implementation of dosing regimens for opioid -substituted patients with polypharmacy when certain prerequisites are cons idered. Various drawbacks limit the applicability of the device to monitor adherence. A careful assessment of patient's barriers to medication adherence and a structured medication review should be the first steps when considering the use of the e- MMA for a patient. Overall, the flexibility of single -subject research designs offers considerable advantages for the evaluation of adherence interventions. Cost -of-illness for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy is high, especially when considering indirect costs , such as productivity loss due to disability. According to our cost comparison model, the novel electronic medication supply model increases overall costs marginally, but might offset th e costs of more expensive alternatives such as nursing homes. In published trials on medication adherence, the congruence between interventions and determinants can be assessed with matching interventions to determinants. To be successful, interventions in medication adherence should target current modifiable patient determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable patient determinants. A 6-item score to assess congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions was not significantly asso ciated with intervention effects in 190 RCTs included in a Cochrane review. The presence of only six studies that included non - adherent patients and the inter -dependency of this item with the remaining five precluded a conclusive assessment of congruence b etween patient characteristics and adherence interventions. The selection of non -adherent patients, measuring adherence -related patient characteristics at baseline, and matching interventions to the study population should be the first steps in the design of future adherence studies capable of demonstrating effectiveness of their intervention. Summary 15 Outlook This thesis offers recommendations from a pharmaceutical care perspective about the e -MMA on the one hand and about adherence to polypharmacy in general on the other hand. Future research about the e- MMA should aim at: quantitatively evaluating the validity of our findings in larger populations of patients with high perceived necessity of treatment, self -reported non -adherence, unforgiving treatments, low so cial support, and high psychologic distress. However, other altern atives should be considered for on-demand treatments and problematic substance use. developing and implementing robust care models for older patients with polypharmacy and opioid -assisted therapy. evaluating the effectiveness of the e -MMA in terms of clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes. evaluating the long -term benefits and cost -effectiveness of the novel supply model. Future research to improve adherence to polypharmacy should aim a t: providing guidelines for the appropriate design and analyses of single -subject trials in adherence research, including recommendations for statistical analysis. developing instruments to reliably assess modifiable and unmodifiable determinants of non -adherence and to select appropriate interventions in research and practice . This thesis provide s first experiences with the use of single -subject research in combination with electronic monitoring of a dherence. With a fraction of the costs of a large RCT, our results demonstrate the advantages and limitations, as well as potential target groups for the e-MMA. Our matched categories for determinants of non -adherence and interventions might provide guidan ce for the choice of interventions to be assessed during the course of such single -subject trials. Ultimately, solid single -case trials that are conducted as part of everyday pharmaceutical care might fill the gap between efficacy and effectiveness for med ication treatments. General Introduction 16 General Introduction Polypharmacy The term \"Polypharmacy\", first appeared in western literature in the 19th century. A medical lexicon from 1846 defined Polypharmacy (from Greek Poly - \"much\" and Pharmakon - \"medicine\") as \"a prescription, consisting of a number of medicines; hence the name \"Polyphar'macus\" given to one who is in the habit of prescribing a numb er of medicines, and who's prescriptions are loaded with ingredients. The term is taken in bad part\"1. Polypharmacy \u2014compounding together multiple ingredients \u2014was regarded at the time as unscientific, compared to \"modern\" Homeopathy that in its pure form only used o ne ingredient2. Fast forward 150 years: Despite ongoing efforts, supporters of homeopathy have yet to provide scientific evidence for its efficacy and polypharmacy is still of great concern. Various definitions of polypharmacy exist today : Besides indicating the use of multiple medications, polypharmacy has been defined as the prescription of medications that do not match diagnosis, contain duplications or interactions, are prescribed for an excessive duration , or are inappropriat e in other ways 3. However, these definitions add confusion instead of clarification, for it has been recognized that the use of multiple medications can be appropriate when correctly prescribed for multiple comorbidities4. To avoid ambiguity , the term polypharmacy should only indicate the use of multiple medications by an individual and not include a valuation of its appropriateness. There is no consensus about the cut -off for the number of medications that define polypharmacy. Again, to avoid ambiguity, any number of medications greater than one could define polypharmacy, getting back to the original definition from 1846. For the purpose of this thesis, polypharmacy is defined as the conc urrent use of two or more medications . Modern medicine has developed evidence -based treatments for many chronic diseases. As a result, the prescription of multiple medications to treat one or more conditions in the same patient has become increasingly common, especially in the elderly5-8. In Scotland, the proportion of adults receiving more than 5 medications doubled to over 20% between 1995 and 20105. Other studies indicate that more than 50% of elderly patients use more than 5 prescription medications in the United States or Europe9,10. In Switzerland, the proportion with prescriptions for 5 or more medications is 17% for community -dwelling adults and over 40% for those aged 65 years and older11. Among 6 European countries, Switzerland had the General Introduction 17 highest proportion (21%) of patients with 10 or more medications admitted to a University Hospital12. With the demo graphic shift towards older age and the concurrent increase in morbidity, the prevalence of polypharmacy will most likely increase in the future. Polypharmacy is associated with various benefits and risks. When prescribed appropriately, multiple medication s may extend life expectancy and improve quality of life4. In contrast, the inappropriate use of multiple medications may increase the risk for adverse d rug reactions and drug -drug -interactions, outpatient visits, hospitalizations, and costs4,13,14. However, appropriate polypharmacy is not without risks: E ven when prescribed according to best evidence, the use o f multiple medications has been associated with risks, such as medication errors and non -adherence15,16. Indeed, the number of medications appeared to be the most important predictor of harm17. This thesis focuses on the risks of appropriate polypharmacy and its association with medication adherence. Medication adherence \"Patient compliance [sic adherence] has become the best documented, but least understood, health behavior.\" - Becker & Maiman, 197518 The prescriptio n of medication is not equal to its correct use: Patients may administer prescribed medications incorrectly, inconsistently, or not at all. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adherence is \"the extent to which a person's behavior \u2014taking medic ation, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes \u2014corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider\" 19. The keyword here is \"agreed\", which differentiates the term \"adherence\" from \"compliance\", another term used to describe the same behavior 20. While adherence and compliance focus on the patient's behavior, \"concordance\" emph asizes the relationship between patient and healthcare professional (Box 1)21. Box 1: Terminology of Compliance, Adherence, and Concordance21 Compliance: The extent to which a patient's behavior matches the prescriber's advice. Adherence: The extent to which the patient's behavior corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider. Concordance: The extent to which the prescription represents a shared decision, in which the beliefs and preferences of the patient have been t aken into consideration. General Introduction 18 More recently, the Ascertaining Barriers to Compliance (ABC) project team defined medication adherence as \"the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed, composed of initiation, implementation and discontinuation\" ( Box 2 and Figure 1)22. Box 2: Adherence Taxonomy22 Initiatio n: Intake of the first dose of a prescribed medication. Discontinuation: Stopping of taking the prescribed medication, for whatever reason(s). Implementation: the extent to which a patient's actual dosing corresponds to the prescribed dosing regimen, fro m initiation until the last dose. Persistence: length of time between initiation and the last dose, which immediately precedes discontinuation. Figure 1: Illustration of the process of adherence to medication, reprinted with permission of the author Each component (initiation, implementation, and discontinuation ) describes different aspects of adherence and requires specific approaches for its management. Adherence management is the \"process of monitoring and supporting patien ts' adherence to medications by health care systems, providers, patients, and their social networks\"22. This thesis focuses on the management of medication adherence during the i mplementation phase. Adherence m easurement Measuring adherence is challenging: It must be feasible for the patient, valid, reliable and objective, continuous, not intrusive or invasive, easy to collect and analyze the data , capture multiple medications, affordable , sustainable, and generalizable23. Various methods for measuring adherence exist: direct methods reliably measure administration of medication (e.g., dire ctly observed therapy [DOT] , ingestible adherence monitors24, and therapeutic drug General Introduction 19 monitoring). Indirect methods measu re adherence by proxy ( e.g., pill count, pharmacy claims data25, self -report26, and electronic monitoring of medication containers27). Each method offers advantages and disadvantages23,28-31. Electronic monitoring has been described as gold -standard especially during the implementation phase because of high resolution and low intrusiveness32-34. Devices registering the time and date of use, such as opening bottles or activation of inhalers , have been introduced in the 1980s35. As a result, it became possible to analyze medication use patterns in detail. The predominant device to monitor adherence with oral, solid formulations is the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS\u00ae; WestRock Switzerland SA , Sion, Switzerland) that ha s been used in 865 studies until December 201636. Measures reported from electron ic monitoring include taking adherence (proportion of prescribed number of medications administered each day), timing adherence (proportion of medications administered within a prescribed period), and timing variability (mean difference to the median intak e time). Drawbacks of electronic monitoring include the possibility of false -positives and false -negatives by misuse of the device, a potential bias by reinforcing medication intake (Hawthorne effect), a device -specific limitation to certain dosage forms , and high costs 31. Specific disadvantages of MEMS are the limitation to the monitoring of a single drug and the uncertainty about the number of removed medications per opening. Hence, the monitoring of polypharmacy is not feasible with these devices. Electronic monitoring of polypharmacy is possible by repackaging all suitable medications into u nit-of-use portions and monitoring each dosing time. The \"POlymedication Electronic Monitoring System \" (POEMS; Confr\u00e9rie Clinique S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland), for example, uses printed electronics affixed to a multi -compartment blister pack to measure adh erence with polypharmacy 37. Overall adherence to medication is often reported to average around 50 % in developed countries19. A newer comprehensive review and meta- analysis of 569 studies from 50 years found average adherence to be around 75% acr oss various conditions and settings38. Its distribution in a population is j -shap ed: a large proportion of people shows perfect adherence (initiation, implementation, and persistence), a substantial proportion does not adhere at all (non- initiation and early discontinuation), and the rest exhibits partial adherence (inconsistent implementation) 39. The \"healthy adherer\" effect describes the phenomenon that optimal adherence is associated with overall healthy behavior and vice versa40. Non - adherence leads to drug -specific issues regarding efficacy, safety, and drug resistance41 and may be the principal reason for gaps between efficacy and effectiveness of treatments42. Due to the negative outcomes of non -adherence ( e.g., increased morbidity, mortality, and costs), General Introduction 20 the improvement of medication adherence has been a focus for the World Health Organization since 200319. Non -adherence is a problem in hospital settings as well as in primary care. In hospitals, medication histories at admission may be incomplete due to non - adherence. Additionally, the (enforced) correct implementation of dosing regimens may lead to adverse events in previously non -adherent patie nts. In primary care, unsatisfactory treatment response due to non -adherence might lead to an escalation of therapy and inappropriate polypharmacy \u2014which, in turn, increases the risk of non -adherence. Arguably, improving adherence might offer cost -effective improvements of clinical outcomes and quality of life43. Determinants of non- adherence Medication adherence is not a stable personality trait but a complex behavior influenced by various factors. Different factors come in to play in the 3 different stages of adherence. Starting (initiating) a treatment poses the first barrier, a conti nuous engagement with treatment poses additional barriers for implementation and may lead to discontinuation and non- persistence. Non -adherenc e might be either intentional or unintentional 44. Unintentional non- adherence can further be divided into erratic and unwitting non -adherence19 and has been shown to be predictive for intentional non- adherence45. This thesis mainly focuses on unintentional non- adherence. Various theoretical models to explain non -adherence have been proposed. The complexity of the characteristics of adherence was already known by the end of the 1970s18. Despite much research in the 1980s and 1990s, few new insights arose. Research in the 1990s emphasized the influence of patient beliefs about health in general and about illness/medication in particular 46. Qualitative research on patients' perspectives started with the new millennium and identified new issues like the quality of the doctor -patient relationship and patient health beliefs47. Grossly, five theoretical approaches could be identified that all consider non- adherence from a different perspective48: The oldest approach is the biomedica l model that focuses on dispositional characteristics of the patient , such as demographic or personality traits. Operant behavior and social learning theories shifted the focus to the behaviors needed for adherence. General Introduction 21 In the communication model , the patient seeks expert advice and treatment from the healthcare professional. Adherence results from persuasion t hrough effective communication. The rational decision -health belief and reasoned action model generated the patient's perception of risk and motivation f or action. Finally, the self -regulative systems theory sees the patients as an active problem solver. Multitudes of determinants reportedly contribute to non -adherence. A systematic review of reviews identified 771 factors that have either positive, negat ive, or neutral effects on adherence49. Determinants are often grouped in five dimensions: patient -related, health system/healthcare team, condition -related, and therapy -related factors19. The impact of each determinant on adherence depends on individual patients and cannot be generalized. Particularly community -dwelling elderly patients with polypharmacy are vulnerable for non -adherence50. Polypharmacy may cause non- adherence because of pill burden alone, but dosing frequency and regimen complexity have also been described to negatively affect adherence51-54. Moreover, cogniti ve impairment and a lack of prospective memory may hinder the successful implementation of medication regimens55,56. Adherence interventions Interventions to improve adherence are diverse, often complex, and show inconsistent results 57. A systematic review of reviews analyzed interventions with regard to theoretical models and found no clear correlation between the effectiveness of interventions that were theory -based a nd those without an explicit theoretical background58. Adherence interventions can be broadly divided into technical, behavioral, educational, and mult i-faceted approaches58. Technical interventio ns usually aim to reduce regimen complexity and include the use of fixed -dose combinations or unit -of-use packaging. Behavioral interventions often include reminders, feedback, support, or rewards. Educational interventions usually provide individual or gr oup education during face -to-face sessions, via audio -visual or written materials, by telephone, mailings, or home visits. Finally, multi - faceted approaches use combinations of the various concepts and have been demonstrated effectiveness in long -term studies59. Recently, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) was developed to simplify the investigation of behavi ors such as adherence and to facilitate intervention design60. The General Introduction 22 evidence for isolated intervention components is weak, but a multitude of interventions seem to improve adherence. Empowering the patient to actively participate in the choice of therapy, take responsibility for self -care, and receive social support have been reported to show the strongest effects for therapeutic success61. In a systematic review of adherence intervention studies using electronic monitoring to assess adherence, only interventions conta ining feedback on electronic monitoring and/or a cognitive -educational component were effective62. Research about interventions addressing barriers associated with polypharmacy is scarce. Reducing pill burden or the frequency of medication intake may improve adh erence, however, this approach is not always feasible 63. A Cochrane -Review assessed the use of \" reminder -packaging\"- systems, interventions that intend to remind patients to take their medication by packaging solid, oral medications into unit -of-use doses64. They found in 12 studies a mean improvement of adherence of 10% for patients using reminder -packaging systems compared to usual care. The use of electronic reminders, such as short message service (sms) or audiovisual reminder devices, was effective in improving short -term adherence (less than 6 months), but long -term effects remain unclear65. Medication management aids The management of medications can be challenging, especially for patients with polypharmacy. Medication management aids (MMA) are commonly suggested and widely used tools to overcome challenges with complex regimens and problems with prospective memory. MMAs are used to organize oral, solid medications by day and time, act as visual reminders, and provide visual adherence feedback. As such, they intend to decrease medication errors and increase patients' independence 66. However, some qualitative evidence suggests that MMAs may be seen as p aternalistic and may not help with memory problems67. MMAs exist in various forms. They can either be filled by the patients themselves, by a caregiver, or are supplied pre -packed b y the pharmacy68. Between 62% and 75% of older adults report at least part -time use of MMAs69,70. Most users fill them by themselves, but some studies suggest that their use may not be adequate to ensure optimal adherence 67,69,71. Pharmacy -filled MMAs can either be the same devices used by patients (multicompartment adherence aids, \"pillboxes\"), or a special reminder packaging that needs additional equipment to prepare (multidrug punch card or blister pouches)68. While multidrug punch cards can be filled manually, the blister pouches are filled by machines and are increasingly pr ovided by specialized blister centres72. In General Introduction 23 Switzerland, this so -called automated dose dispensing (ADD) is mainly used for patients in nursing homes or other care facilities, while provision to primary healthcare patients is more common in the Nordic countries and the Netherlands72. Pharmacy -filled MMAs and ADD services are expected to increase safety, reduce medication costs, and save nurses working time72. MMAs offer various advantages but also suffer from drawbacks ( Table 1). Despite the reported improvement of adherence in patients using these systems, knowledge about medications and cognitive function are reduced in patients receiving pharmacy -filled MMAs73. MMAs provide visual feedback whether a dose has already been taken or not and might deflect issues with cognitive impairment to a certain degree. Electronic medication management aids Apart from the visual cue to take their medication, more advanced electronic MMAs may offer more exp licit reminders, such as visual or audible alerts. R eminders have been shown to improve adherence independently of MMAs64,74. Electronic monitoring can be used to provide customized feedback. The most advanced devices combine repackaging, reminders, and adhe rence feedback to patients and health care providers in real -time, and restrict access to medications according to schedule. Various electronic MMAs (e -MMAs) for polypharmacy exist, but only few studies using these devices have been published. A review of electronic adherence monitoring devices incorporated into the packaging of medication included 37 studies with 4326 patients 75. The reviewers identified 5 common characteristics of e -MMA: recording and storing of dosing events, audiovisual reminders, digital displays, real -time monitoring, and feedback on adherence. They found effects ranging from a 2.9% decrease to a 34% increase in mean adherence for the studied e- MMAs and concluded that devices integrated into the care delivery system are most frequently associated with positive effects on adherence. Recently, a systematic re views of electronic multi- compartment aids identified 6 studies of overall poor methodological quality76. A Canadian group performed a randomized controlled trial in 2013 with DoPill\u00ae (Figure 2 ), a device that generates a signal when the membrane covering one of its 28 cavities is removed77. The authors reported taking adherence (pills taken divided by pills given) and concluded tha t the device offered reliable and objective monitoring of adherence to pharmacotherapy for Schizophrenia and may help patients to manage their medication regimens. A cluster -randomized trial from 2015 used an electronic \"medication monitor box\" for treatme nt of tuberculosis in China78. They reported the mean of the percentage of patient -mon ths on treatment where at least 20% of doses were missed and found significant lower missed doses in patients receiving reminders from the e -General Introduction 24 MMA compared to no reminders or text -message based reminders. A Swedish study from 2016 assessed the use of Med -o-Wheel\u00ae (Figure 3) in patients after renal transplantation79. They aggregated the electronic monitoring data across the study period for the entire intervention group and reported a combined taking adherence of 97.8%. However, adherence in the control group was not assessed and graft rejection rates did not significantly differ between th e two groups . Of 40 patients randomized to the intervention, three withdrew due to a \"feeling of being monitored\" and one because the experience of extreme stress due to the e-MMA. Medido \u00ae (Figure 4), an e- MMA for pharmacy -filled blister pouches, has been developed in the Netherlands and is currently marketed by Philips\u00ae. No studies investigating the device have been published at the beginning of this P hD project. General Introduction 25 Table 1: Advantages (+) and disadvantages ( -) of Medication management aids.

A multinational cross -sectional survey showed that only half of the participants regularly ask patients with chronic conditions about adherence, and pharmacists were significantly less likely to intervene than other professionals81. However, pharmacists as suppliers of medications with frequent patient contact are in a unique position to interview patients about barriers to treatment and to offer individual support for enhancing adherence. Community pharmacies are healthcare facilities with low entry barriers that provide various services related \u2014but not limited \u2014to medications. Throughout the past century, the role of community pharmacists has shifted from a product -centered role to a provider of patient - centered services 82,83. In 2011, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) published in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) a declaration of \"Good Pharmacy Practice\", which defined four major roles for the pharmacist beyond the traditional responsibilities in medication logistics ( Box 3) 84. Box 3: Roles of the pharmacist defined by the WHO/FIP Declaration 2011 Role 1: Prepare, obtain, store, secure, distribute, administer, dispense and dispose of medical products. Role 2: Provide effective medication therapy management. Role 3: Maintain and improve professional performance. Role 4: Contribute to improve effectiveness of the health -care system and public health. These roles actively involve pharmacists in the medication management process. Key objective is to improve the patient's health by promoting a rational use of medications. This practice can also be described with the term \"pharmaceutical care\" (PhC). The definition most often referred to was published by Hepler and Strand in 1990: \"Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes which improve a patient's quality of life.\" Other terms describing medicines -related patient care have evolved, such as medicines management 85, disease management86, and m edication therapy management (MTM)87. As a result, substantial confusion remains about what PhC inclu des and how to differentiate it from other terms. The management of polypharmacy and medication adherence represent important aspects of PhC and good pharmacy practice. The Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE) aims to develop pharmacy along the lines of General Introduction 28 pharmaceutical care through stimulation of research and implementation projects in the involved European countries88. In Switzerland, pharmacists provide various services related to polypharmacy and medication management reimbursed by health insurances. For patients with three or more medications, pharmacy -filled MMAs are currently reimbursed with 21.60 Swiss Francs (SFr) per week. Concurrent use of four or more medications during at least 3 months qualifies for a structured medication review (reimbursed with 4 8.60 SFr twice a year). This \"Polymedication Check\" for example identified adherence -related issues in 26.7 % of 450 outpatients included in a recent study 89. Rationale and Approach The goal of this thesis was to investigate adherence to polypharmacy and the tailoring of adherence interventions from a pharmaceutical care perspective. The thesis approaches this goal in four parts: Project A As medication adh erence is a process influenced by large inter -individual variability, it needs to be tackled with individual patients in mind. Individual care around pharmaceuticals has been termed \" pharmaceutical care \" (PhC), but substantial confusion remains about its contents and differentiations from similar terms. Project A sets the scene with a re- definition of pharmaceutical care based on existing literature and a consensus of experts in the field. Project B Adherence to polypharmacy poses a multi- dimensional chall enge to global health care systems. Similar to the increasing complexity of our therapies for chronic health conditions, no simple solution exists for the management of polypharmacy and adherence. Project B evaluates the prevalence of the prescription of s plit preparations for elderly patients, as an example for a common practice that increases regimen complexity and may have a negative impact on adherence. Project C Recent advances in the field provide opportunities to assist patients with polypharmacy an d simultaneously monitor and improve adherence with electronic medication management aids (e -MMA). However, potential target groups of these e- MMAs and their use by patients General Introduction 29 have not been investigated yet. Project C explores the use of a remote electronic medication management aid for prepackaged polypharmacy in primary care patients. Project D Despite much research, interventions aimed at improving medication adherence report disappointing and inconsistent results. A potential explanation might be that ap proaches seldom matched interventions and patient determinants of non -adherence in clinical trials. Project D examines the congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions in published trials.

Epub 2014 Apr 20. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 36 Abstract Background: Twenty- three years after Hepler and Strand published their well -known definition of pharmaceutical care (PhC), confusion remains about what the term includes and how to differentiate it from other terms. The board of the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe felt the need to redefine PhC and to answer the question: \"What is Pharmaceutical Care in 2013\". Objective: The aims of this paper were to review existing definitions of PhC and to describe the process of developing a redefined definition. Methods: A lite rature search was conducted in the MEDLINE database (1964 - January 2013). Keywords included \" pharmaceutical care \", \"medication ( therapy) management\", \"medicine management\", and \" pharmacist care\" in the title or abstract together with the term \"defin*\". To ease comparison between definitions, we developed a standardi zed syntax to paraphrase the definitions. During a dedicated meeting, a moderated discussion about the definition of PhC was organized . Results: The initial literature search produced 186 hits, with 8 unique PhC definitions. Hand searching identified a further 11 unique definitions. These 19 definitions were paraphrased using the standardized syntax (provider, recipient, subject, outcome, activities). Fourteen members of PCNE and 10 additional experts attended the moderated discussion. Working groups of increasing size developed intermediate definitions, which had similarities and differences to those retrieved in the literature search. At the end of the session, participants reached a consensus on a \"PCNE definition of Pharmaceutical Care\" reading: \"Pharmaceutical Care is the pharmacist's contribution to the care of individuals in order to optimize medicines use and improve health outcomes.\" Conclusions: It was possible to paraphrase definitions of PhC using a standardized syntax focusing on the provider, recipient, subject, outcomes, and activities included in PhC practice. During a one -day workshop, experts in PhC research agreed on a definition, intended to be applicable for the present time, r epresentative for various work settings, and valid for countries inside and outside of Europe. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 37 Impact of findings on practice The aim of PCNE is to help to develop pharmacy along the lines of pharmaceutical care (PhC) in the involved European countries. We hope to harmonies the use of a single definition amongst European researchers and, ultimately, practitioners. This new PCNE definition of PhC directly derives from previous definitions and is intended to unite the current understanding of PhC with respect to the evolution of this practice philosophy during the last 35 years. Introduction The term \"p harmaceutical care\" (PhC) is frequently used as a keyword in health care literature, as an activity in patient care, or as a module within a teaching cur riculum. In most cases, people refer to the definition given by Hepler and Strand in 199099: \"Pharmaceutical care is the responsible provision of drug therapy for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes which improve a pati ent's quality of life.\" A more patient -centered approach was endorsed by Linda Strand et al., who stated in 1997 that PhC is not only a theory but also a philosophy of practice 100. Since then, new terms and concepts of medicines -related patient care have evolved, such as medicines management85, disease management86, and m edication therapy management (MTM)87. Twenty -three years after the definition was published by Hepler and Strand, substantial confusion still remains about what PhC includes and how to differentiate it from such other terms. According to McGivney et al.101, for example, MTM integrates both the philosophy and practice of PhC and elements of Di sease Management. Some authors and authorities see PhC as a responsibility shared by all health professionals, while others restrict it to the pharmacy profession (see Table 1). These difficulties with definitions were also recently addressed in a joint editorial from the International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy and the journal Pharmacy Practice102. The board of the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE), a European network of researchers in the field of pharmaceutical care, therefore, felt the need to redefine PhC and to answer the ques tion: \"What is Pharmaceutical Care in 2013\" 102. The aims of this paper are (a) to review existing definitions in literature in order to better understand their development and (b) to describe the process of achieving a redefined definition, during a one -day consensus meeting of experts. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 38 Methods Literature search A literature search was conducted in the MEDLINE database from 1964 to January 2013 . The search was restricted to publications in English, German, or French. Keywords included \"pharmaceutical care\", \" medication ( therapy) management\", \" medicine management\", and \"pharmacist care\" in the title or abstract together with the term \"defin*\" to identify existing definitions of PhC. The exact string is shown in Box 4. Each source was scanned for explicit definitions of PhC and cross -references. Co -authors of this paper provided additional sources for definitions not identified previously, usually from the grey literature. Box 4: String used for literature search ((pharmaceutical care[Title/Abstract]) or (medication management[Title/Abstract]) or (medication therapy management[Title/Abstract]) or (medicine management[Title/Abstract]) or (pharmacist care[Title/Abstract])) AND (defin*[Title/Abstract]) The retrieved definitions were grouped by the year of publication and publisher. To ease comparison between definitions, we paraphrased the definitions using a standardized syntax developed by the authors, as shown in Figure 5. For this standardized transcri ption, we considered both the definition itself and the additional published information. Similar terms with the same meaning were subsumed under one term ( e.g., \"drug therapy\" was considered equivalent to \"pharmacotherapy\"). For this paraphrase, we only c onsidered activities explicitly described in the publication, such as the examples given in Figure 5. Workshop for definition development The workshop was organized on February 5, 2013 in Berlin. The board of PCNE had announced this workshop to all members. In addition, 44 experts in the field of pharmaceutical care were invited personally. A total of 24 individuals (all pharmacists, 14 members of PCNE) attended this one-day meeting, representing 11 different European countries, plus the USA and Australia. The meeting was facilitated by all authors, including a certified moderator, who led the workshop and the discussion, and was audio -recorded, with consent. Two week s in advance, workshop participants were given the standardized syntax from Figure 5, together with a draft of T able 2 with PhC definitions and standardized paraphrases, to ensure that all started from a minimum position of knowledge. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 39 In order to achieve a consensus of all invited experts, we chose a method in accordance with the \"Consensus- Oriented Decision -Making model\" developed by Tim Hartnett103. This method assured active participation of every individual and created a commonly shared understanding at the same time. It had been used successfully by the moderator in other contexts several times. The procedure was divided into two steps. First, the participant suggested a range of ideas about what PhC meant for them, in order to create a clear definition. Then, the participants analyzed this shared understanding in order to support the redefined definition and to represent the opinion of as many participants as possible. In the first step, small working groups of three participants from d ifferent countries had to agree on a definition that covered similarities between their ideas about PhC. In order to reach agreement, participants were asked to switch to a meta -level (\"chunk up\") and find the virtual meaning behind their definitions. \"Chu nking\" means to reorganize or break down experiences into bigger or smaller pieces. \"Chunking up\" involves moving to a larger, more general or abstract level of information. A greater vision of ideas made it possible to reach consensus. Each group document ed their results on flip charts and presented them to the other groups. Three consecutive rounds of two working groups merging and undertaking the same process led to the formation of a single large working group. At this point, we aimed to reach a first b road but consolidated definition. In the next step, questions regarding provider, recipient, subject, and outcome of PhC helped to substantiate the broad definition. The aim was to fine -tune the definition (\"chunk down\"). \"Chunking down\" means moving to a more specific and concrete level of information. To ensure the consideration and discussion of all arguments for and against issues and to make decisions that accounted for all perspectives, it was necessary to continue working with all participants in one group in a plenary session. Step by step, all conflicting details were discussed and finally led to a precise definition of PhC. The audio -recorded statements were summarized and topics addressed were identified. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 40 Figure 5: Standardized syntax for p harmaceutical care definitions, with examples to illustrate each domain (provider, recipient, subject, outcome, and activity) Results Literature search The initial MEDLINE search produced 186 hits. After review of the search result s based on the title, 37 publications were excluded. The abstracts of the remaining 149 publications were reviewed and 95 full -text publications were examined. From these, eight original definitions of PhC were identified. Most papers cited the definition developed by He pler and Strand in 199099. Additional sources from references cited in the bibliographies and from co - authors' inputs generated a total of 19 unique PhC definitions. Table 2 shows the definitions, with their authors and year of publicat ion, and the relevant standardiz ed paraphrase. From the paraphrased versions of the definitions, it is apparent that the pro vider of PhC remained unspecified in the majority of definitions (9/19, 47%). Five of the first 8 definitions published before 1997 did not attribute a profession to the role of the provider while, in contrast, only 4 of the 10 definitions after 1997 did n ot define a provider. In 1997, Linda Strand introduced the generic term \"practitioner\", which was used in 4 definitions (21%) after 1997. However, 5 definitions regarded \"the pharmacist\" (26%) or \"the pharmacist and the provider of PhC. Fifteen (79%) definitions focused on the individual patient, and 3 (16%) defined the collective of patients as the recipients of PhC. The recipient remained unclear in one (5%) Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 41 definition. Nine (47%) definitions named \"pharmacotherapy\" as the subject, while 8 (42%) \"drug -related and one (5%) named \"drug -use\". In one (5%) of the definitions, no subject was mentioned. \"Optimal outcomes of therapy\" and \"optimal quality of life\" account for half of the mentioned outcomes in 5 (26%) of the definitio ns each. Interestingly, the term \"optimal quality of life\" only appeared during the years 1990 to 1996. \"Optimal pharmacotherapy\" was defined as the outcome in 2 (11%) of the existing definitions. In 7 of the 19 definitions, other outcomes (2/19, 11%) or n o outcomes (5/19, 26%) of PhC were specified. Most definitions did not include specific activities to be performed in the PhC process (14/19, 75%). \"Detecting, preventing, and resolving drug medication review, and evaluation clinical and psychosocial effects\", \"monitoring their pharmacotherapy\", and \"establishing and administering a pharmaceutical care plan\" were mentioned in one definition each (5%). Workshop for definition d evelopment Morning session: \"Chunk up\" The aim of the morning session was to find an intermediate definition for PhC as a basis for discussion. The intermediat e definitions were then harmonized in the afternoon plenary session. The results of the process a re displayed in Figure 6. Six groups (1 - 6) of three participants each formulated an initial definition of PhC. These definitions were already quite specific but differed in most aspects (provider, recipient, subject, outcome, activities) between the groups. After the merging of pairs of groups into larger groups of six participants, four refined definitions were generated: Groups 1/2 described PhC as \"patient/health care which is delivered through pharmacy practice\". The service is provided by pharmacy practitioners, not only to patients but to consumers as well. Pharmaceutical expertise is needed and PhC can be provided by the pharmacist or somebody else with that expertise. For the participants of Group 3/4 it was important that PhC was a practice philosophy. The provider does not have to be a pharmacist but a \"competent practitioner that takes responsibility\". The recipient of PhC is the individual patient. The listing of all PhC activities such as \"detecting, resolving and monitoring actual and potential drug related problems\" was replaced by \"to resolve drug related needs\". In this intermediate definition, the aim of PhC was \"to assure optimal outc omes\". 42 Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 Table 2: Pharmaceutical care definitions sorted by year Year Author/Context Definition Standardized Paraphrase 1975 Mikeal, R.

Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 46 Group 5/6 had a strong emphasis on the \"outcome\" of PhC in their definition, which was to \"optimize the use of medicines and therapy\". The activities were specified as \"the provision of care, care programs and services\". For this group it was important that the rec ipient was not only the individual patient but also society more broadly. The definition of group 7/8 described PhC as the \"contribution of the pharmacist in the care for individuals\"; hence, the recipient was not only the patient but also every individual. This group was the only group that named the pharmacotherapy as the subject of PhC. They saw the aim of PhC as \"to assure the responsible use of medicine\". The \"responsible use of medicine\" is based on the WHO -definition 121 meaning the effectiveness, including quality of life, efficiency and safety of medicines. The activities are not explicitly mentioned, as they are tools used to perform PhC. In the next step, before reaching consensus on the final harmonized definition, pairs of groups were merged again. The two groups, each of twelve participants, then agreed on one intermediate definition each. The first group debated whether to disregard the concept that PhC was de fined by \"taking responsibility by providing care\", with some participants arguing that it was not possible for the competent practitioner to take responsibility alone for the patient. The joined group defined the activities of PhC as \"detecting, resolving and monitoring actual and potential drug -related problems\". In the other group, there was a debate on the phrasing of the outcome of PhC. A participant stated that it is not possible \"to assure the responsible use of medicine\" but rather \"enhance both the responsible use of medicine and to improve health outcomes\". In addition, the group agreed on a more general definition and to remove the subject \"pharmacotherapy\". Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PC NE definition 2013 47 Figure 6: Process of definition development Afternoon session: \"Chunk down\" In the afternoon, all participants discussed the two intermediate definitions and their components together, in a plenary session. All aspects of the definitions retrieved in the literature search (provider, recipient, subject, outcome, and ac tivities) emerged during the discussion, and new topics concerning the context of the definition arose as well. The scope of the definition was discussed several times. The moderators proposed limiting the scope of use of the definition to research and pro fessionals working within PCNE. Some participants argued that PCNE should set standards not only for its members, but also for other professionals, practitioners, and policy makers. However, all members agreed that if researchers used the definition consis tently, it would be likely that other professionals, practitioners, and policy makers would adopt the meaning of our definition. Participants also pointed out that it was important to have a short and simple definition to avoid confusion and to promote dis semination. The concept of PhC and its relation to other terms such as \"Pharmacist Care\", \"Pharmacy Practice\", and \"Medication Management\" was extensively discussed at an early stage of the chunk down session. Some participants argued, and it was acknowled ged by others, that PhC did not need to be redefined at all, but that its relation to other terms needed clarification. All participants agreed that the PCNE definition should depict the evolution of PhC and clarify already existing definitions. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 48 A frequent ly emerging topic was the political relevance of a redefined definition of PhC. Some participants claimed that PCNE should be responsible for communicating the value of PhC to policy makers. According to this, the definition should be used to distinguish t he functions of pharmacists and to differentiate types of services and activities in a pharmacy (e.g., compounding, counselling, and provision of PhC). One participant mentioned that in the USA, the term MTM had replaced PhC because \" medication therapy management\" wa s thought to mean the same as \"pharmaceutical c are\" to US policy makers. Differences between countries and languages were mentioned as problematic at a policy level. One participant, for example, stated that there is no exact translation of the English word \"care\" into Danish. These culture and language challenges have been known for some time, but were never properly addressed122. The provider of PhC was an area of conflict between participants. Every member of the group agreed that the provision of PhC was not limited to the pharmacy premises, but was independent of the place. Some argued that it should be the pharmacist exclusively, whereas others o pted for the use of \"healthcare professional\" or \"competent professional\". However, most participants agreed that it was important to define specifically the role of the pharmacist, without excluding any other professional. Since PhC is a term mostly used by pharmacists, the profession should therefore be named in the definition. As one member highlighted, this was already implied in most previous definitions without explicitly stating it. Furthermore, it was felt that the definition should \" energies pharma cists to deliver PhC\". All participants but one agreed with using the term \"contribution of the pharmacist\". Thus, other healthcare professionals and the recipient of PhC are not excluded. Some people stated that medication -related care could be provided b y other healthcare professionals, but this would then not be called PhC. The question was raised whether it should be \"the pharmacist and the team\", rather than the pharmacist alone. Participants agreed that PhC should be the responsibility of the pharmaci st because they were the responsible person for pharmaceutical treatment by law. One participant argued that the education level of other pharmacy staff (technicians, assistants) differed between countries, while the pharmacist's education is similar world wide. Thus, for example, pharmacy technicians were not able to deliver the same level of care in all countries and should not be part of the definition. The recipient of PhC was less of a controversy. Participants agreed not to use the term \"patient\", but were initially undecided whether to use \"individual\", \"society\", or both \"individual and society\". In the end, everyone agreed to the use of \"individuals\", because PhC Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 49 could be delivered to a group of people simultaneously but should be a service tailored to each recipient individually. The subject of PhC was discussed thoroughly. It was clear for all participants that PhC should be dealing with the care around medicines. On the other hand, some participants also wanted to address services that did not incl ude medicines, because individuals often did not only have drug therapy problems when approaching a pharmacist. There was concern about losing such activities currently seen as PhC ( e.g., lifestyle -related) and therefore that this would discourage others f rom using the definition. Other participants felt that almost all existing definitions dealt only with medicine -related needs or medicine use and that other services that are also provided in the pharmacy were not unrecognized . However, non - pharmacological treatment could be the subject of PhC when medicines were involved or were being evaluated in the course of the practice. Another subject of debate was the term \"enhance the responsible use of medicines\" previously used by the World Health Organization (WHO) 121. However, participants felt that this connection to the WHO term would not be self -evident and that, by itself, \"responsible use\" was rather more system - oriented than patient -centered. Some participants argued for the substitution of \"responsible\" with \"appropriate\" or \"rational\" without agreeing on one or the other. In the end, the whole term was replaced with \" optimize medicines use\". Participants agreed that this expression is more patient -centered , conveyed the same meaning as the WHO term, and included interventions not directly related to medicines. The outcomes of PhC were briefly discussed towards the end of the session. Participants agreed to include the t erm \"improve health outcomes\", referring to the scope of the definition, which aimed at researchers who relied on evidence -based protocols and measurable outcomes. One attendee pointed out that it was not possible for a pharmacist to improve health outcome s, but only to help individuals \"to do it themselves\". A term suggested by one participant was \"quality of life\" (QoL), but others rejected this, arguing that medicine use and health outcomes could be improved without measurably improving QoL. All particip ants clearly agreed not to mention specific activities as part of PhC into the definition. The main concerns were that there were different activities and services provided in different countries, and because PhC should not be understood as the provision o f standalone services, but rather as an integrated process linked to an individual assessment. Some participants also pointed out that not all PhC -related services were clearly defined, which would only add confusion to the definition. The final definition is phrased in Box 5. Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 50 Box 5: The PCNE definition o f pharmaceutical care 2013: \u00abPharmaceutical Care is the pharmacist's contribution to the care of individuals in order to optimiz e medicines use and improve health outcomes.\u00bb To facilitate dissemination, participants agreed to have a position paper123 created. To clarify choices made, important issues that were discussed at the meeting should be mentioned. They emphasiz ed that a cceptance of the agreed definition needs comments and explanation of the context. They also agreed on publication of both the position paper and a scientific article, and they asked the main moderators and initiators of the workshop to assume authorship. Finally, participants discussed and set up some rules on the procedure of publication. Discussion This paper proposes a redefined definition for pharmaceutical care. The definition has been created by experts, who felt the need to do so. In the result section, the discussion has been outlined on how the experts have reached the current definition. There is no need to reiterate the discussion here. In this section, we will discuss the process of the literature search and the workshop for the definition development. Applying a systematic approach to identify unique definitions of PhC proved difficult because of the broad variety o f possible terms. We decided to use a semi -structured approach with a focus on cross -references from publications identified with the MEDLINE search and inputs from co -authors. The initial MEDLINE search produced almost 200 hits, from which we identified 8 original definitions. The careful examination of the reference lists of the identified publications and inputs from co- authors yielded additional 11 sources for definitions, more than the database search itself. The inclusion of these definitions may have caused a selection bias, because new definitions were likely to be influenced by the definitions found in their reference list. This indicates some deficiency of our MEDLINE search. On the one hand, the search strategy itself was deliberately restrictive. On the other hand, some definitions originated from conferences or other grey literature and their sources are not covered by MEDLINE. Since it was not possible to predict the appearance of a definition on the sole basis of keywords in the title or abstract, many articles had to be scanned in full -text. As a result, a broad literature search that would have covered more sources was not feasible. Independent definitions not identified through our literature search, or the search performed by other authors, were thus missed in this work. As a consequence, we cannot assure the Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 51 completeness of our list. However, we can safely assume that the definitions with the highest impact on research and practice were considered. Remarkably, \"pharmaceutical c are\" is not a Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term, while \"nursing care\", or \"dental c are\" are. Me SH terms significantly improve searching and it would be desirable to add \"pharmaceutical c are\" to the MeSH vocabulary. The use of a standardized syntax to paraphrase the definitions allowed for comparison between the different formulations. In some cases, we had to decide about the equivalence of terms ( e.g., \"drug therapy\" and \"pharmacotherapy\"). To some extent, these decisions were subject to interpretation and could be discussed in a dedicated article. Additionally, it is clear that some information and intention of the original definition were lost during the process of paraphrasing. We understand that the individual wording and syntax of a definition contribute to its meaning. It was not our intention to replace existing definitions with a standardized version. We believe that our standardized syntax was suitable as a working tool for the experts participating in the workshop, to facilitate ease of comparison, to unders tand the evolution of the definitions over a period of years, and to create a new definition for future use. The PCNE definition of PhC directly derives from those previous definitions and is intended to unite the current understanding of PhC with respect to the evolution of this practice philosophy during the last 35 years. Differences between previous definitions and the PCNE definition and further explanations about the wording and scope are discussed thoroughly in the position paper 123. Participants w ere invited based on their affiliation to PCNE and as a consequence, the result is only representative for this subgroup of researchers and professionals. PCNE is an organization with 36 individual and 23 institutional members from 21 European countries. Additionally, it has observers from countries in other parts of the world. During the meeting, people were present from a large number of countries, as outlined in the acknowledgements. Although PCNE is not representative of the whole pharmaceutical care co mmunity, it is the only association that purposely unites researchers and health care professionals that deal with pharmaceutical care almost every day. Furthermore, active participants in the workshop included representatives from the European Association of Hospital Pharmacists (EAHP), the European Society of Clinical Pharmacy (ESCP), and international experts from overseas. This selection of participants from different countries and from a broad variety of work settings ensures the generalizability of the PCNE definition within and outside of Europe and for Proj ect A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 52 different fields of work. In our opinion, this gives the group legitimacy to create a valid definition of PhC. The chosen method of consensus by using the Hartnett model made sure that various ideas could be combined and concentrated to a shared understanding that focused on the crucial key points of PhC. The benefit of small working groups growing larger during the process was that participation of each individual was guaranteed and no opinion leader w as able to take control of the discussion. This way, the result should be representative for the whole group. In his book \"Consensus Oriented Decision Making\" 103, Tim Hartnett emphasizes the importance of the following unifying principles for the consensus development process: inclusive and participatory (all group members included and encouraged to participate) agreement seeking (generating as much agreement as possible) process oriente d (the way in which the decision is made is as important as the resulting decision, all participants are respected and their contributions are welcome) collaborative (all group members shape a decision that meets all the concerns as much as possible - part icipants don't compete and there are no winners and losers) relationship building (the resulting shared ownership of decisions and increased group cohesion can promote the implementation of decisions) whole group thinking (personal preferences are less imp ortant than a broader understanding of how to work together to help the group succeed) The selected method met these characteristics and cleared the way for a group consensus. The effects of previous agreements and the dominance of opinion leaders were min imized by the changing of group composition and the obligation to find collaborative solutions. Limitations included that there was only limited time in the workshop, which impeded reflection on the inputs and forced participants to make quicker decisions than they might have wished. Due to the intensive program, the concentration of participants may have decreased towards the end. Reaching a consensus might have been driven by the wish to conclude, rather than having reached a shared agreement, although all participants have stated they were happy with the redefined definition at the end of the meeting. Conclusion Many definitions of P hC exist that differ greatly from each other. For comparison, it is possible to paraphrase each definition with a standardiz ed syntax focusing on the provider, recipient, subject, outcomes, and activities included in the PhC practice. During a one -day workshop, experts in PhC research agreed on a definition that should be representative for Project A1 | Pharmaceutical care - the PCNE definition 2013 53 various work settings and should be v alid for countries inside and outside of Europe, and adopted to the current time.

Epub 2015 Oct 11.Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 58 Abstract Background: Prescription of fragmented tablets is useful for individualization of dose but includes several drawbacks. Although without score lines, the antipsychotic drug quetiapine was in 2011 the most often prescribed 1/2 tablet in discharge prescriptions at the University Hospital in Basel (USB, 671 beds). We aimed at analyzing the prescription patterns of split tablets in general and of quetiapine in particular in Switzerland. Methods: All orders of community pharmacies for unit -of-use soft pouch blisters placed at Medifilm AG, the leader company in Switzerland for repackaging i nto pouch blisters, were analyzed . Results: Out of 4,784,999 tablets that were repacked in 2012 in unit -of-use pouch blisters, 8.5% were fragmented, mostly in half (87.6%), and were predominantly psycholeptics (pipamperone 15.8%). Prescription of half quetiapine appears to be a Basel specificity (highest rates of fragments and half quetiapine). Conclusions: Prescription of fragmented tablet is frequent. It represents a safety issue for the patient, and a pharmaceutical care issue for the pharmacist. In ambulatory care, the patient's cognitive and physical capacities must be clarified, suitability of the splitting of the tablet must be checked, appropriate aids must be offered, like a pill -splitting device in order to improve accuracy, and safe use of the drug must be ensured. Project B1 | Issues around t he prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 59 Introduction Previous studies showed that fragmenting concerns every fourth tablet in ambulatory setting124, 125, predominantly because of dose adjustment, swallowing difficulties or costs126- 128. However, some drawbacks exist , such as breaking difficulties, breaking in unequal parts, and loss of mass128. Further, changing the dosage form may degrade the active substance at the fractured surface, and thus alter its absorption characteristics. The site of action may not be reached, which may be clinically relevant, especially for substances with narrow therapeutic index129. The keeping of the halves may be difficult because of problems of stability and of identification. Further, cont rolled release forms are unsuitable for splitting, since their destruction can lead to dose -dumping and dose -dependent side effects by altering the liberation kinetics of the substance. Finally, substances with irritating or toxic properties, especially th e CMR -substances (carcinogen, mutagen or toxic for reproduction) should be split only with protective measures ( e.g., gloves, masks) 130. The European regulatory authorities evaluated splitting tablets into segments131. This apparently simple operation bears a potential for dosage error that increases if the tablets are not scored. In view of the many exceptions where splitting is not allowed (enteric coated tablets, layered tablets, many modified -release dosage forms) the authorities concluded that manufacturers should provide information on the issues surrounding cutting tablets into smaller segments. In the US, the FDA, the American Medical Association, and other medical organizations consider tablet splitting as a risky practice and advise against it unless it's specified in the drug's labeling 132. The analysis of electronic medication regimens from 54 wards of a large University hospital in Germany showed that 12.5% of all drugs were prescribed in split form 133. Splitting was inappropriate for 2.7% of all drugs, mainly because of the absence of a score line. A retrospective study performed at the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland showed similar results 134. Of the 36,751 electronic prescriptions delivered 2011 at discharge, 3,724 (10.1%) contained the mention \"\u00bd\" and concerned 4,888 single tablets. Of those \u00bd tablets, 16.4% were wrongly prescribed, predominantly due to inexistent score lines. Quetiapine (Seroquel \u00ae, Sequase\u00ae 25mg), a tablet with no score line, was the drug most often wrongly prescribed as half tablet. Quetiapine is an atypical or second -generation antipsychotic agent similar in structure to clozapine, and exhibits strong antagonism of 5HT 2 receptors and weak antagonism of D 2 receptors135. It is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorders136, and is widely used, mainly because it does not induce agranulocytosis137 and thus, does not require blood monitoring. Its substantial advantage is further a favorable profile of acute Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 60 extrapyramidal side effects that occur in very rare cases138. Off -label use is common \u2014i.e. unlabeled or unapproved use \u2014in conditions such as agitation, anxiety, demen tia, obsessive - compulsive disorders, psychosis139, and delirium140, 141. Because of many inconclusive study results, evidence is limited. A meta -analysis of seven randomized controlled studies with 3,257 participants evalu ated the effects of quetiapine for anxiety disorders at doses ranging between 25 -400 mg/day142. Monotherapy with quetiapine was better than placebo in reducing symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder, and was equivalent to antidepressants in improving depressive symptoms. In all studies, more subjects in the quetiapine group left the trials early due to adverse events (gained weight, sedation). The additional use of quetiapine at dose s between 25 -600 mg/d was established in a further meta -analysis only in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder139. The small clinical studies mostly started doses at 25 mg/day143- 145. We were able to find low -dose quetiapine at 12.5 mg only in one Italian study for the initiation of treatment in 41 patients with dementia and concomitant psychotic disorders146 and in one Spanish study with 7 Parkinson's patients, wher e low -dose quetiapine was effective on psychotic symptoms, sleep disturbances and stress of the caregivers147. Building up on the local obser vation of 2012, we aimed at analyzing the general prescription patterns of split tablets in Switzerland. Thus, the questions of interest are \"What is the prevalence of split tablets in Switzerland? Is the wrong prescription of half quetiapine tablets restricted to a local habit in Basel?\" Further, we aimed at evaluating the consequences of split tablets for community pharmacies, patients and patient care organizations and discussing some recommendations for daily practice. Material and Methods We obtained a ll orders placed by Swiss community pharmacies at Medifilm AG, the leader company in Switzerland in the repackaging of medication into unit -of-use soft pouch blisters, located in the industrial area of Oensingen (canton Solothurn)148. Community pharmacists can order rolls of single pouches containing various medications to be taken at one time, mainly for long -term institutionalized patients. Segm ents of tablets can be ordered without restriction. Orders are submitted to quality assurance checks. When split tablets are required and corresponding lower dosage strength is available as single tablet on the market, an exchange takes place. If no lower dosage strength is available, and the formulation of the tablet is conventional (i.e. no enteric coat, no modified -release), the tablet is fragmented with an automatic pill -splitter. According to the Summary of Product Characteristics 136, quetiapine tablet is a round, 6mm in diamete r, film -coated tablet without score line. Since its formulation Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of hal f tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 61 is without functional coating, the splitting of the lowest strength of quetiapine tablet (Seroquel\u00ae 25mg original brand, and Sequase\u00ae 25mg generic brand approved since 09.2011) is performed. Presence of a score line and suitability for splitting of tablets were obtained from the Swiss Summary of Products Characteristics136.

Of these , a total of 406,956 (8.5%) were fragments of tablets that had been ordered by 29 community pharmacies for 1,321 patients residing in 53 retirement homes in n orthern Switzerland. The homes have used in 2012 between 14 and 48,300 fragmented tablets ( Table 3 ). The patients were in average 81.5 \u00b1 14.7 years old (median 86; range 7 -105) and obtained in average 1.7 fragments (median 1; range 1 -8). A total of 577 (43.7%) patients received two or more fragments of tablets ( Table 4). The majority of the fragments were halves (356,339; 87.6%) and quarters (45,375; 11.1%), and marginally thirds, and three -quarters (5,242; 1.3%; Figure 7 ).

Grey areas indicate cantonal borders. The two distant homes located in the cantons SG and GR (<0.1% split tablets; no quetiapine) are not depicted. Discussion Fragments of tablets represented 8.5% of all tablets ordered 2012 by 53 community pharmacies in n orthern Switzerland for institutionalized patients. This value is probably below the effective prescription rates of fragmented tablets since splitting at the company Medifilm is reserved for cases where no lower dosage strength is available on the market. Consequently, the actual value of dispen sed fragmented tablets in ambulatory setting might be higher, given that the exchange for a commercially available lower strength is not automated in community pharmacists during routine practice. A recent study in Swedish community pharmacies showed that 52.5% of the patients with a prescription for split tablets preferred whole tablets of the appropriate streng th rather than to split tablets 150.

Out of the 10 most often ordered split tablets, two (quetiapine and risperido ne) had doubtful legitimacy to be fragmented since the decision cannot be backed up with the product information. Although splitting a tablet that is not intended to be fragmented doesn't seem to be a prescribing error151- 153, it may reduce drug effectiveness and induce toxicity, and thus represents a safety issue. Wrong prescription of \u00bd tablets usually does not cause significant patient harm, since for many drugs, especially those with a wide therapeutic range and a long half- life, dose fluctuations are unlikely to be clinically significant. The above applies for quetiapine, even more since its formulation is without functional coating or modified release. In any case, some pitfalls exist when fragmenting tablets that are not intended to. First, patients may be easily confused about the correct dose. An effective instruction of the patients by the health professional is a prerequisite to minimize intake errors, especially when patients received information at the time of hospital discharge that diverges from the finally dispensed medication, e.g., obta ining half tablets during hospitalization, leading to an initial prescription of a half tablet that is modified to one tablet of a lower dose. In the worst case, patients may split the wrong medication, and take too few or too much medication. Second, pati ents might have poor visual acuity or dexterity that render fragmenting very uncertain. They need at least the right tools and should be given a pill -splitting device to improve accuracy. Third, patients may store the remaining fragments or crumbles inadeq uately, which may affect medication stability, or use a container with no labelling, which renders a later identification of the fragments almost impossible. Fourth, patients may split several medications, which seems to be a frequent situation with 43.7% of our patients obtaining two fragments or more. Because the identification of the fragments is limited, the presence of multiple fragments represents probably the riskiest situation, with a wrong intake resulting invariably from one handling error. Given the potential risks, it is striking that half of the splitting concerned psychoactive substances in this elderly population. However, the appropriateness of splitting tablets may result from clinical observation. Because most manufacturer -based research ex cludes frail elderly, and as such the appropriate dose for such patients, the prescription of split tablets may be the result of over -sedation observed with whole tablets. Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapi ne 67 All above mentioned processes may represent safety issues, be time -consuming for pat ients, their relatives or care give rs in charge of the medication managements, and ultimately generate costs that may clear the savings initially advocated for splitting tablets154. Finally, since hand -written prescriptions are still common, misreading by the pharmacist of one -half (1/2) as one to two (1 -2) tablets can only be ruled out if prescribers would order strength and dose of the medication in milligrams155. The USB is a 671 -bed teaching hospital in n orthwestern Switzerland and serves as a major referral center for the 1 million region. At the USB, quetiapine is administered off- label for the prevention of delirium in the postoperative setting, starting at doses of 5mg/day with 5mg capsules exclusively produced at the hospital pharmacy. Quetiapine is also used off -label for the therapy of delirium according to an internal scheme156 where multiple doses of 12.5mg up to 50mg/24h (<80 years) or 5mg up to 25mg/24h (>80 years) are administered on the first day, with doubling of the dose on the second day. According to this scheme, therapy should be reduced or stopped after 5 days. On the wards at the USB, a dose of 12.5mg quetiapine is administered as \u00bd tablet of 25mg strength according to a recommendation note of the Division of acute geriatrics. Quetiapi ne is the favorite drug for hospitalized elderly who are slightly disorientated and mildly agitated, e.g., who stand up and are at risks of falling. Further, quetiapine has a short half -life, an antihistaminic action, and a lower incidence of QTc prolongat ion compared with haloperidol, the standard delirium therapy. From a clinical point of view, trials on pharmacological prevention of delirium did not show conclusive results 157. No controlled maintenance treatment trials have been conducted with quetiapine, unlike for all other atypical antipsychotics which have demonstrated a positive effect on relapse prevention 138. In studies that investigated effects on negative symptoms (emotional and social withdrawal, poverty of speech, lack of drive and motivation, disinterest) and used haloperidol as the comparator drug, quetiapine did not show any advantage138. Independently of the (non -)existing evidence, the internal scheme used at the USB recommends reducing or stopping treatment with quetiapine after 5 days, which information seems to get lo st during hospitalization . Neglecting to annotate the duration of use, i.e. the \"stop\" date of a treatment, represents a prescription error which may be costly 158. Further, preventive pharmacological therapy in geriatric patients can expose them to the unnecessary risk of adverse effects. Furthermore, all antipsychotics inclusive quetiapine are listed in the Beers Criteria as potentially inappropriate for use in elderly patients (quetiapine is an exception for patients with Parkinson's disease) 159. Thus, continued antipsychotic therapy in geriatric patients should be re -evaluated at each care transition, and stopped in Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 68 absenc e of clear indication. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that low -dose quetiapine does not seem to be administered for its antipsychotic effects but rather for its sedative effects in the elderly hospitalized patients, in an empiric manner and in absence of clear evidence for a proven alternative. Finally, it seems that the irrational case of \u00bd quetiapine 25mg remains confined to Basel and its clinics and didn't spread out. However, the level is surprising high when one considers that 5 years had passed s ince the official introduction of the recommendation in the division of acute geriatrics. The observation that community pharmacies ordering unit -of-use soft pouch blisters were massively located in northern Switzerland (with one marginal exception in the Grisons) may reflect a cultural difference between German speaking regions in the n orthern, and French and Italian speaking regions in the southern, and is not a limitation. Conclusions Tablet splitting has a major role in dosage adjustment and should be limited to specific clinical situation, i.e. titration of dose, pediatric and geriatric patients, and according to the recommendation of the product manufacturer. Physicians who prescribe to split a tablet that is not intended to be fragmented and pharmacis ts who dispense the drug accordingly should be aware that this renders the medication unlicensed. Since resolving the uncertainty about the prescription by the pharmacists or the nurses results in much unnecessary work, splitting tablet is not suited as a method of general cost reduction. Taking into account all problems linked to the handling of a half tablet (patients' dexterity and eyesight, conservation and confusion of the halves, wastage, therapeutic compliance), prescribing \u00bd tablet represents a safety issue. Thus, prescribers should make effort to use commercially available whole tablets. If splitting tablets is still necessary, patient counseling is recommended and pharmacies should deliver the appropriate tools or pharmacists split the tablets for the patient and repackage them. Quetiapine 25mg remains the third most often prescribed half tablet in n orthern Switzerland in general and the first specifically in Basel. As off -label prescribing is claimed to be not evidence -based, to undermine the regulatory system, to be costly, to put the patient at risk and to impact negatively on pharmaceutical innovation 160, this situation is more than frightening. It is usually in the company's interests to extend the indications of its pro ducts. However, in this particular case, the pharmaceutical industry seems to limit its investment Project B1 | Issues around the prescription of half tablets in Northern Switzerland: The irrational Case of Quetiapine 69 probably because generic formulations are available. Pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to introduce new strengths to an existing range of product s, in view of an optimization of seamless care between the different health care professionals.

Allemann, Kurt E. Hersberger, and Isabelle Arnet Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland Integr Pharm | Patien views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 74 Abstract Objective: To collect opinions on medication management aids (MMAs) in general and on an electronic MMA (e -MMA) dispensing prepackaged polypharmacy in sealed pouches. Study setting: The setting involved community -dwelling older adults in Basel, Switzerland, in 2013. Study design: The study involved 1) a 14 -day trial with the e -MMA and 2) a focus group to identify general attri butes of MMAs, their applicability to the e- MMA, and possible target groups for the e -MMA. Data collection methods: Six participants using long -term polypharmacy and willing to try new technologies completed the 14 -day trial and participated in the focus g roup. Inductive content analysis was performed to extract data. Principal findings: Participants rated ten of 17 general attributes as clearly applicable to the e-MMA and five as unsuitable. Attributes pertained to three interrelating themes: product desig n, patient support, and living conditions. Envisaged target groups were patients with time -sensitive medication regimens, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together to prevent accidental intake of the wrong medicati on. Conclusion: The evaluated e- MMA for prepackaged polypharmacy met the majority of the requirements set for an MMA. Patients' living conditions, such as mobility, remain the key determinants for acceptance of an e -MMA. Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory s etting 75 Introduction Health -care profess ionals not only have to provide patients with the correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy. They must also enable patients to \"take their medication as prescribed\", a seemingly simple behavior which is known as medication adherence22. A review of 50 years of adherence research estimates a mean adherence rate of 75.2 %, ranging from 65.5 % for sleep disorders to 88.3 % for HIV 38. Non -adherence, or the failure to take medication as prescribed, strongly relates to negative outcomes161. The development of effective interventions to improve adherence is a quest many researchers and practitioners have been pursuing for decades. Due to its inherent complexity, there is no one- size-fits-all solu tion to combat non- adherence 57. A simple method is the use of a device that holds a predefined number of medication organized by day and time according to a patient's individual therapy plan. Such med ication management aids (MMA) exist in various shapes and they are widely used for presumably non- adherent patients, especially older adults64. Annotation of relevant literature Between 62% and 75% of older adults report at least part -time use of MMAs69,70. MMAs can be managed by the patient or are pre- filled at a pharmacy or by another caregiver68. Despite their widespread use, the authors of a review of the effects of MMA concluded that the design and targeting of these devices need further research 64. MMAs generally tar get therapy -related factors, condition -related factors, and social factors of non -adherence, aiming to improve unintentional non- adherence during the implementation phase22. Given the fact that all doses need to be prepared in advance for each intake time, patients are able to see whether they have already taken their medication or not. Hence, MMAs classify as \"feedback and monitoring\" interventions according to the \"Behavior Change Technique\" (BCT) Taxonomy162. Until now, the measurement of adherence with MMAs was restricted to indirect or subjective measures like pill counts, timeliness of refills or patients' self -report37. Electronic measurement is considered a \"gold standard\" but with polypharmacy this method is in its early stages37. Recently, electronic MMAs emerged, reminding patients with acoustic or visual alerts to take their medication, dispensing the right medicat ion at the right time, and tracking each event. These developments allow for the objective measurement of adherence. We could identify only very few studies about electronic MMAs, either focusing on measuring adherence only 27,163 or on the technical specifications164- 166. In a study assessing the satisfaction of 96 older adults with an electronic medication dispensing device in home care, participants accepted the device as \"very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 76 management of their medications\"167. Although a high rejection rate was reported, the study report did not address participants' motivation to use or reject the device in the first place. The final report on a project with electronic MMAs aiming at improving self -management among non- adherent patients concluded that \"anyone who has difficulty remembering to take their medication\" may benefit from such an intervention168. Of 380 participants of this project, more than 30% were in the early stages of dementia and approximately 20% had physical disabilities, such as dexterity issues or visual impairment. Around 10% left the study because they did not like the dispenser and around 7.5% because they were non -adherent. Around half of all patients approached to participate declined for various reasons, e.g., they did not like the look or the sound of the dispenser, they felt the dispenser was taking control of their medication management , or they did not want t o take the device out to social events. Thus, we hypothesize that programs using e- MMAs often missed to target the optimal users. The goal of this study was to gather information regarding the use of an electronic MMA by community -dwelling older adults usi ng chronic polypharmacy. The aims were: 1. to collect and evaluate attributes of medication management aids important to patients; 2. to evaluate the use of a specific electronic MMA with polypharmacy pre- packaged in pouches in relation to these attributes; 3. to identify the target group that could benefit most from the electronic MMA. Materials and methods Participant selection The investigators (IA and KH) recruited a convenience sample of community -dwelling older adults with self -disclosed long -term use of polyp harmacy and willingness to try innovative technologies from a community pharmacy in Basel (Switzerland). Medication Management Aid (MMA) An Automatic Tablet Dispensing and Packaging System (ATDPS; Desk Type JV- 30DE, HD- Medi, Germany) was used to repack all solid oral prescription medications for each participant into unit -of-dose pouches. Each pouch was imprinted with the patient's name, date of birth, date and time for intake, as well as number, name, color, and shape of the medication contained ( Figure 9). Every participant received a roll with pouches for 14 days loaded into a dispenser installed at their homes. The dispenser (Medido\u00ae, Innospense BV, Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative asses sment in an ambulatory setting 77 Netherlands) was a remote controlled, electronic MMA reminding the patients with acoustic alerts to take their medication ( Figure 10 ). Pushing the OK -button stops t he alarm and delivers the pouches with pre -packaged medication. Date and time of delivery are simultaneously recorded with GPRS -technology. Delivery of doses ahead of schedule is possible by pushing the OK -button for 5 seconds. This important feature named pocket -doses enables patients to go out of the house during intake times. Time of dispense was individually set accordingly to participants' preferences. SA demonstrated the use of the dispenser during the installation and provided written instructions wi th telephone numbers to call an investigator for assistance in case of technical problems. Figure 9: Unit -of-dose pouches with pre -packaged oral solid medication Figure 10: -controlled, electronic dispenser for the unit -of-dose pouches Medido\u00ae used in this study as specific e - MMA with power cord in lower right corner (height x width x length: 140 mm x 140 mm x 225 mm, weight: 1486 g) Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 78 Data collection Participants were asked to write down any dispensing of pocket -doses, malfunctions, or noteworthy events during the 14 days of use. Upon returning of the dispenser, they were interviewed based on a short interview guide with the following questions to collect spontaneous reactions: 1. How was the operation of [the device]? 2. How did you integrate [the device] into your daily life 3. What additional benefits can [the device] provide for daily medication intake? 4. What monthly fee would you be willing to pay for [the device]? Additionally, we invited al l participants to attend a focus group. Focus groups provide concentrated interactions in a short time frame and allow the generation of data based on the synergy of the members in a group 169. For this exploratory study, only one focus group was carried out using a semi -structured approach. Based on the answers from the short interviews and literature, a preliminary list with attributes was compiled by the investigators (Appendix A.2.3 ). A focus group script was developed and pilot tested with regards to compreh ension and timeline with an 83 -year -old female using chronic polypharmacy who was not enrolled in the study (Appendix A.2.2 ). The focus group took place in a conference room of the University of Basel and lasted 2 hours. First, participants filled out a short form including demographics and data about their medication therapy. After a brief introduction, participants were guided through the following 4 steps: 1. write down attributes of MMAs in general judged as important (every participant individually); 2. clarify the meaning of the attributes (plenary discussion); 3. vote on the applicability of the attributes to the electronic dispens er, inclusive additional attributes from the preliminary list; 4. define target groups for the dispenser based on one's 14 -day experience. SA moderated the focus group, while IA took notes and compared the proposed attributes with the preliminary list. Partic ipants used playing cards to vote on the attributes; one color (red hearts) for \"yes I agree\", another color (black clubs) for \"no I disagree\" and the joker to initiate a discussion. Whenever a joker was raised, participants discussed issues and repeated their voting afterwards, until no joker was displayed. The focus group was held in Swiss German and audio -taped. One researcher (SA) orthographically transcribed the recording in Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharm acy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 79 German, preserving dialect expressions. Attributes and quotes mentioned in thi s article were translated into English by SA and IA. Content analysis Inductive content analysis was used as theoretical framework based on Krueger's approach170 as outlined by Rabiee169. In brief, this method uses categories, which are derived directly from the data, as opposed to deductive content analysis that is based on earlier work 171. Krueger's approach includes five interrelating stages: familiarization; identifying a thematic framework; indexing; charting; mapping and interpretation169. The data were coded by SA, reviewed by IA, and discussed by both for validation. Inconsistencie s were resolved by consensus. Attributes were grouped in sets to form major themes. No attributes were excluded. Qualitative data was entered into the software MAXQDA 11 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany) to support analyses. The study data are reported accordi ng to the COREQ guideline, a checklist with consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research172. Results Seven persons were contacted between February and May 2013. All accepted to participate and completed the full 14 -day assessment period. One participant refrained from participating in the focus group due to conflicting dates and was excluded from analyses. Six participants (4 women, 2 men) aged 55 to 76 years (mean 65.3 years) attended the focus group ( Table 6). Al l but 2 women were retired and all declared to spend in average 38% of their daytime activities (except weekends) at home. Three women lived alone (50%), the other participants shared a household with a partner. Participants were taking daily 2 -5 (mean 3.3) solid oral medicines with a posology of 1 -3 intake times and at least one intake in the morning. All 168 scheduled doses were delivered (100% reliability). All patients retrieved in total twenty -eight doses (17%) as pocket -doses for intake outsi de of the home. During step 1, participants wrote down 13 individual attributes of MMAs judged as important. Two further attributes emerged from the discussion (step 2) and another 2 were proposed from the preliminary list, adding to a total of 17 attribu tes ( Table 7). Participants rated 10 attributes as clearly applicable to the e -dispenser ( Table 7). F ive attributes were rated as unsuitable, like the consumption of power and production of waste (ecological aspect), lack of mobility, insufficient information about the pre -packaged Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 80 medication, and perceived inflexibility of the intake times. Participants also expressed the desire to receive reminders of upcoming refill events and appointments with the physician. The votes on 2 attributes were equally distributed (good looking and place -saving). The themes that emerged during step 2 (discussion) were interrelated and concerned product design, patient support and living conditions .

Participants controversially discussed the size and appearance of the dispenser, which was compared to \"a monster\" and a \"toaster\" by P5. They found it difficult to find a place for the dispenser, wanting to hide it in \"a corner of the home\" [\"eine Ecke in \"more beautiful than expected\" [\"sch\u00f6ner als erwartet\"]. Participants agreed that the appearance was subject to individual likings, as was the location where it was placed. All participants found it easy to use the dispenser as instructed. P3 found the OK -button quite rough -running, but had no problems operating the device. P2 stated that the dispenser should allow narrower in tervals than the 10 -minute intervals to set reminders. P1, P2, and P6 mentioned the light emitted from the device as relatively bright, and the sound as quite loud. P5 stated that the design became less important when she started experiencing benefits from the dispenser: \"If I had to rely on it [the dispenser], I would have looked for some corner in the home, where it wouldn't be very dominant [laughs]. However, the look didn't play such a big role anymore. That has taken a back Hintergrund getreten.\"] The pre- packaged medication in pouches was perceived as extremely reassuring and convenient. Simultaneous recording of the dispense time did not worry the participants. Patient support This theme relates to the impac t of the dispenser on patients' ability to adhere to their therapy (e .g., the effectiveness of the dispenser in assuring the regular and timely intake of the correct dose). P1 mentioned that the dispenser acted as an alarm clock in the morning and that she took her medications on time, while she would otherwise just take them \"any time before going to bed\" [\"irgendwann vor dem ins Bett gehen\"]. Participants also discussed the complexity of medication regimens, stating that the dispenser seemingly reduced th e burden of taking multiple medications: \"Because I only had one pouch, I only took one. It was like, less than before, when I have to take three drugs. Because it was like the three were on their own.\" [Weil ich nur eine T\u00fcte hatte, vorher, wenn 3 die drei gewesen ist.\"] (P4). However, participants voiced concerns about the handling of medication changes Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 82 when there were still pouches in the dispenser: \"I find it difficult, when I have to go to a doctor and I receive a new drug, it's not in the pouches. How does one do it, do I take it myself until the roll is finished, the additional drug? Or when something needs to go out, does one empty out all pouche s into a pill box, so it's not wasted?\" keine Verschwendung ist?\"] (P1). Similarly, participants had the feeling of losing knowledge about their medication: \"It is a danger; one simply takes what comes out and doesn't think about how they [the drugs] act and how it plays together.\" [Es wie die wirken und wie es zusammenspielt.\"] (P1). Two participants felt relieved by the device and mentioned that they had not to think about taking their medication because the dispenser took care of everything: \"He [the dispenser] thinks for me and he beeps and then he spits it [the medication] out, everything ready, found it wonderful actu ally. Well, it is a luxury for me, you see, I don't need it but it is, er, would be a great luxury.\" [der denkt f\u00fcr mich Luxus gewesen.\"] (P5). Living conditions This theme covers the attributes flexibility of intake times and patient mobility. Three participants felt under pressure and other -directed because they had to be at home at specific times. P4 described a feeling of resistance to \"take commands\" from the dispenser. P2 reacted by switching the device off when leaving the house: \"Well, for me it was stress, especially in the evening. When I knew I wasn't there I just switched it [the dispenser] off. And then I switched it on again in the morning and it started up and that was no problem.\" [Gut f\u00fcr mich war ist kein Problem gewesen.\"] P6 acknowledged the usefulness for retrieving pocket -doses for planned absences, but not for unplanned belatedness. The impressions and expectations at first sight changed for most participants over time, sometimes dramatically. P3 and P5 declared initial negative attitudes toward product design, which changed to a positive attitude after using the dispenser for two weeks. Conversely, P2, P4, and P6 with initially neutral or positive expectations developed strong negative feelings Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 83 over time, describing aggression and stress. P6 was expecting no problems but felt enslaved and had the feeling of \"not taking the medication out of free will\" [\"es wa r nicht mein freier Wille\"]. The participant with the most positive experiences after the 14 -day use was also the only participant reporting prior difficulties with taking the medication (P5). Target groups for the dispenser All participants agreed that th e dispenser could be beneficial to some patients. The envisaged target groups were patients with time- sensitive medication regimens (transplant patients, HIV-patients), patients with dementia, the visually impaired, or generally patients requiring assistan ce with their medication. P4 mentioned that the dispenser could help distinguish the medication of several patients living together and prevent accidental intake of someone else's medication. P4 mentioned the possibility of using the dispenser for feedback purposes to discuss irregularities in a patient's medication -taking behavior. Participants had contradictory opinions about the appropriate age to start using the dispenser. On one hand, they stated that the dispenser would be appropriate only when patien ts could not cope without external assistance. On the other hand, they favored an early inception when patients were still capable of adopting to new technologies. Participants agreed that the device would be appropriate only for patients spending most of their time at home, or when only taking medication in the morning. All participants emphasized the importance of individually assessing patients' motivation and need of such a device. When asked for the monthly fee participants would be willing to pay, the answers ranged from 0 to 25 Swiss francs (SFr) per month (0 to 28 USD). P6 noted that 25 SFr would be appropriate when the dispenser could show a clear beneficial effect. In contrary, P2 participant stated that the dispenser should be free of charge when someone is in need for it. However, if someone is able to cope without the dispenser but wishes to use it, a monthly fee of 10 -20 SFr seems appropriate according to this participant. The same participant pointed out that one might treat the device careless ly when provided at no charge. Discussion The concept of electronic medication management aid (e -MMA) or \"smart pillbox\" is not new and an increasing number of devices combine the functionality of an MMA with electronic monitoring173. E-MMAs with pre -packaged pouches mostly target patients living at home who receive s upport from home care services for their medication therapy. Instead of the daily Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 84 visit(s) to prepare the doses and supervise correct intake, the caregiver only has to refill the dispenser in predefined intervals while maintaining supervision of correct do sing. Our results show that the assessed e -MMA meets most of the general requirements set for an MMA in the areas of patient support and implications on patient habits. The participants reported no technical problems with the e -MMA, probably due to carefu l oral and written instruction before use and their interest in electronic technologies. The major limitation voiced by our participants concerned the restricted mobility inherent to a bulky device that needs continuous power supply. This aspect may restri ct the applicability of the e- MMA to patients with limited mobility. Similarly, a report by the University of Birmingham reviewing electronic dispensers also stated that \"people who regularly leave the home may also find it less practical\" 174. Retrieving pouches before intake times (pocket -dose) to overcome this limitation was not often put into practice by our mobile participants. Anticipating an absence that will collide with an intake time requires cognitive abilities known as prospective memory 56. A lack of prospective memory is associated with non -adherence56. Therefore, the patients who could benefit from an e -MMA may be those who are unlikely to anticipate an absence during a later intake time. Alternately, the mobile patients who could most benefit from the dispenser may be those with only one intake time in the morning, since they do not need to be at home at specific times in the afternoons or evenings. Obtrusiveness was not an issue, however, the participants only judged the physical dimension of the term (i .e. technology is not perceived as undesirable and physically prominent 175, giving the German word \"unauff\u00e4l lig\"). The psychological dimension of the term ( i.e. the tendency to intrude, especially upon privacy)175 was not mentioned as drawback of the e- MMA, even though all participants were aware of t he electronic real -time monitoring. Two participants declared a certain reluctance to \"follow\" a machine, which however refers more to their relationship to the aspect of dependence and its symbol of loss of function and abilities175 than to an objection to the e -MMA. Thus, according to the model of obtrusiveness in telehealth176, our e - MMA possesses an adequate size (physical dimension), is user friendly (usability dimension), does not invade personal sphere (privacy dimension) and has optimal performance (function dim ension). The design of an MMA is important as acknowledged by other authors 64. Our results suggest that design might be an initial barrier but is likely to fade after the patient experiences concrete benefits from the dev ice. Thus, health -care professionals should more point out the potential benefits of the device on the regulated intake and less the external appearance. The fact that the voting for the two attributes \"looks good\" and \"is space -saving\" were distributed Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 85 equally demonstrates the mixed feelings of the participants. However, since appearance and size are subject to personal liking, those attributes should not be emphasized by the health professional. Further, participants of our study accustomed to the e -MMA in only 14 days and were likely to change their preconceived opinions about the device during this short period. Therefore, it may be appropriate to propose an evaluation period of 2 -4 weeks to reluctant patients and to offer the device at no costs for th is accommodation time. Patients' characteristics represent only one of the five dimensions of non -adherence (beside condition, therapy, socio -economic situation, health care system19. An adherence intervention like an e- MMA can have a significant influence on clinical outcomes, as long as it targets patients with the need for and the motivation to use an e -MMA. Thus, each case needs individual assessment and e .g., intentionally non- adherent patients should be ruled out, as stated in the Birmingham report174. We could not find any publication concerning the appropriate age to pro pose an e -MMA to a patient taking chronic medication. Our study participants recognized that the main condition for adopting and integrating an e -MMA into daily routine remains that it fits patient's habits. This favors an early inception of the device sin ce mental flexibility may decrease with advancing age. As a consequence, cognitive dysfunction or dementia may be incompatible with an electronic medication management aid, although some authors suggest that those patients represent the target group for th e provision of an e -MMA to combat non- adherence 177. In the \"Automated Pill Dispenser Project\", more than 70% of participants were 75 years of age and older, and almost half of these were older than 85 years168. The same study also advised against the use of such aids in patients with moderate to severe dementia. Further studies should investigate these contradictory suggestions. We acknowledge some limitations to the study. Our sample was not representative for the general population. This may limit the external validity and generalizability of our findings, since other participants could have judged different attributes important. This could be overcome by conduction additional focus g roups in different populations. Literature suggests conducting at least three to four focus groups to reach theoretical data saturation169. We chose to conduct only one focus group since the topic of electronic medication devices is not new and a preliminary list of attributes could be generated from the literature. As a consequence, we considered the literature as the reflection of several experts' opinions and our focus group as the last opinions -gathering group. Project C1 | Patient views on an electronic dispensing device for prepackaged polypharmacy: a qualitative assessment in an ambulatory setting 86 Our study shows some strengths. Consensus on the most attributes of the e -MMA was obtained unanimously. Because participants voted by raisi ng their card simultaneously and individually without seeing the others' choices, this consensus cannot mirror the desire to vote in accordance with the group. Our results have theoretical and practical implications , such as the need to improve the design and targeting of MMAs. Not only should the appearance of the MMA, but also its functionality and the whole medication supply process be considered during the design process. Further prospective, randomized and contro lled intervention trials should aim at quantitatively evaluating the validity of our findings in larger populations of patients with time -sensitive medication regimens, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together.

Allemann Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Switz erland Project report based on the Master's thesis by Fabienne Suppiger, supervised by Prof. Kurt E. Hersbergera, Dr. Kenneth D\u00fcrstelerb, and Samuel Allemanna a Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Basel, Switzerland b Division of Substance Use Disorders, Psychiatric University Clinics of Basel, Switzerland Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid depen dence syndrome: A longitudinal observational Opioid -assisted treatment ( OAT ) is the preferred treatment for opioid - dependent patients. OAT is provided in controlled settings to approximately 19'400 of the 22'000 -27'000 opioid -dependent patients in Switzerland. Thanks to the success of OAT , life expectancy for opioid -dependent pat ients improved greatly. Recently, sustained -release Morphine has gained interest for OAT . Similarly, Methylphenidate, approved for the treatment in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , has been considered for substitution of Cocaine dependency. The pr evalence of the use of these substances and other medications in an ageing population remains unclear. Objectives: An outpatient addiction service (OAS) provides OAT and other medications to opioid -dependent patients in Basel (Switzerland) and records all dispensing events in an electronic database. This study is a first -time retrospective analysis of the patient collective, the drug prescriptions and dispensing practice at the OAS in Basel. Methods: We performed a longitudinal observational study with hist orical data recorded between 2002 and 2013 at the OAS in Basel. We analyzed demographic properties, general information about medications, information about opioid substitution treatment, and Information about treatment with methylphenidate. We applied Man n-Whitney U -Test for comparisons of two independent groups, Wilcoxon signed -rank test for paired groups, and linear regression to estimate trends. Results: Between 2002 and 2013, the number of patients increased from 112 to 154. Mean age rose from 37.1 to 45.0 years. Alongside, the number of active ingredients per patient increased from 2.71 to 3.55 per year . Most substances were used in the therapeutic area of the nervous system, which includes all substitution medications and methylphenidate preparations. Methadone remained the predominant substance for OAT , but its use declined by 25%. Most of this proportion was replaced by sustained -release Morphine preparations. Methylphenidate prescriptions declined from 21.4% in 2002 to 16.9% in 2013. Short -acting preparations were fully replaced by long -acting formulations. Conclusion: Treatment facilities providing OAT must accommodate their setting for older patients with polypharmacy. A more diverse selection of different treatments increases the complexity of pha rmacotherapy and requires close collaboration of different healthcare providers. Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 89 Introduction Between 0.1% and 0.7% of the population in Western Europe are affected by a problematic opioid use178. Whil e the number of new opioid -dependent patients in Switzerland declined sharply in the past two decades, the prevalence of opioid -dependence remained stable179. This can be explained by the medicalization of the problem, its recognition as a chronic condi tion, and the success of opioid -assisted treatment ( OAT ). In 2010, an estimated 22'000 to 27'000 people in Switzerland were opioid -dependent and roughly 19'400 received OAT . Over 90% treated with Methadone, around 8% with Diacetylmorphine (Heroine), 5% with Buprenorph ine, 1% with other opioids, such as sustained -release Morphine 180. Due to its long half -life, methadone is considered the gold standard for OAT . However, its side effects and serious interactions with other medications pose limitations for its use. Recently , sustained -release morphine preparations have gained interest for use in OAT181. Long -term OAT has been shown to reduce various risks associated w ith illicit drug use, including infectious diseases, overdoses, premature deaths, disability, crime, prostitution, and social isolation182. As a result, life expectancy for patients increased considerably, leading to an increasing age of opioid -dependent patients receiving OAT183- 185. In Basel, Switzerland, the proportion of patients with OAT aged 50 years and older increased tenfold between 1996 and 2003, while that of patients younger than 30 years plunged from 52% to 12%186. Due to their history of drug abuse and its associated lifest yle, patients often appear prematurely aged and suffer from chronic diseases and disability, such as Arthritis, Hypertension, chronic lung disease, stomach ulcers, coronary disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus 187. Additionally, the prevalence of chronic infection s, such as Hepatitis B and C or hu man immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are significantly higher compared to the general population183, 184, 188. Consequently, many older patients with OAT often need additional long -term medications, resulting in polypharmacy and complex regimens. Together with a high prevalence of psychological problems and low social support, these patients are at high risk for medication non- adherence. Opioid -dependent patients often use other addictive substances , such as Alcohol, Nicotine, Cocaine, Amphetamines, or Benzodiazepines. In a representat ive sample of 578 persons with opioid use disorders, around 70% met criteria for dependence on an additional substance, and 20% were Cocaine -dependent 189. Abuse of Cocaine is associated with negative health effects and can trigger affective disorders and psychoses. Similar to OAT , there have been attempts to replace Cocaine with medications to avoid adverse effects. Although the stimulant Methylphenidate appears promising to be substituted for Cocaine, several randomized Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence synd rome: A longitudinal observational study 90 controlled trials have not been able to show a reduction in Cocaine use or craving190. In Switzerland, Methylphenidate is approved for the treatment of attention defici t hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for Narcolepsy. The global prevalence of adult ADHD has been estimated at 3.4%191, 192, but up to 30% of cocaine -dependent patients and 25% of patients receiving OAT fulfil diagnos tic criteria for adult ADHD. Especially in context with concomitant substance abuse, the prescription of Methylphenidate for adult ADHD should require a careful diagnosis and only long -acting formulations should be used 193. Despites its potential risk of abuse, the benefits of treatment with Methylphenidate for adult ADHD outweighs the potential risks194. Rationale The shift to an older age of patients with OAT poses multiple challenges for appropriate therapy. Apart from other risk factors , such as a high prevalence of psych ological problems and low social support, increasing age and polypharmacy could be additional barriers to medication adherence for patients with opioid substitution therapy. Due to its interaction potential and possible side- effects, Methadone may not be i deal for OAT in older patients with polypharmacy. Other options are available, but there is a lack of information about the prevalence of their use. ADHD might be an additional risk factor associated with both substance use disorders and non -adherence 195. Due to a high risk of abuse, the short -acting Methylphenidate formulations do not offer benefits in the treatment of these patients and only the use of long -acting formulations is recommended. It is unclear how these recommendations are being followed. One of the largest provider of OAT in Basel, Switzerland, electronically registers all dispensed medicines in a database since 2002. The analysis of this data might offer a better understanding of the current medication profiles of this population with the potential to inform future work to improve medication supply and treatment in this setting. Aims Our goal was to establish a thorough understanding of the medication profiles of opioid dependent users in an outpatient addiction service (OAS) in Basel, Switzerland. We aimed to: describe the demographics of the study population assess the numbers and nature of medications dispensed to patients of the OAS with a focus on opioid substitution treatments, methylphenidate, and treatments for other comorbidities Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 91 Methods Study design and setting We performed a longitudinal observational study with historical data. The setting was the Outpatient Addiction Service (OAS) of the Psychiatric University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. The OAS offers treatment to patients with substance use disorders, mental and somatic disorders, and social impairments and problems. Patients are treated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of professionals from the fields of medicine, nursing, social work and psychology. Up to 100 patients per day visit the public dispensing point of the OAS to obtain their medication. Patients take their (substitution) medication on site under supervision at least once per week and receive additional doses and medications for take-home. Participants We included all datasets of patients registered in the substitution program that received medications from the OAS between 200 2 and 2013 and had a prescription for at least one medication on the reference day for each year. Data sources and variables Data were sourced from the electronic claims database of the OAS. We extracted the following variables for the years between 2002 and 2013 from the Access\u00ae -based database (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington - USA): Unique case number Date of birth Sex Name of the medication Database specific number for the medication Dosage Galenic form Unity The reference day for this extraction was June 30th of each year or the following Monday if this date fell on a weekend. The data were then imported to Excel\u00ae (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington - USA) for further processing. Procedures The database showed several deficiencies that needed correction b efore analysis: the substance number used internally did not uniquely define a substance, the substance name Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 92 was arbitrary chosen, and preparations and active ingredient were only partially specified. It also contained typing errors, the pharmaceutical for m was not consistent, and the unit for liquid and solid dosage forms was used inconsistently. We added the following variables: Active ingredients Anatomical therapeutic chemical ( ATC ) Codes Pharma -Codes (Swiss identifier for product entities) The variable \"unit\" was split into \"dose\" and \"dose intensity\" in order to distinguish the prescribed dose for solid and liquid dosage, respectively. For comparability, all substitution drug doses were converted to methadone -equivalent doses. We excluded the followin g items from analysis: Dressing materials (e.g., Elastomull\u00ae) Vaccinations (e.g., Twinrix\u00ae, Engerix\u00ae) Preparations without active ingredients (e.g., Sodium chloride NaCl). Duplicate cases, which referred to the same drug with a different drug name were unified. For summary statistics, we aggregated the data by case and year. We validated the processed data by comparing two random samples of each year with the raw data in the Excel files and corrected our procedures until we reached 100% conformity between comparisons. Plausibility of doses was assessed by comparison with data from a second reference day adjacent to the extraction date. In case of discrepancies, the daily dose was corrected according to Table 8. Additional doses ( e.g., reserve doses) were not included in the calculation of the daily dose for a single patient. Variables We analyzed demographic properties (age, sex), general informat ion about medication (number of dispensed substances [active ingredients] and number of medications [unique galenic forms] per patient), total number of unique substances dispensed by the OAS and their therapeutic area, information about opioid substitutio n treatment (substance, galenic form, and dose used for OAT ), and Information about treatment with methylphenidate (prevalence, galenic form and dose). Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 93 Statistical methods Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS\u00ae (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM, Armonk, New York - USA). We calculated means and medians, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations for descriptive variables. We applied Mann -Whitney U -Test for comparisons of two independent groups, Wilcoxon signed -rank test for paired gr oups, and linear regression to estimate trends. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Table 8: Correction criteria and performed measures.

Results Participants In 2002, the OAS treated 112 individual patients, increasing to 154 patients in 2013. The trend implies a linear increase of 4.4 patients per year (R2 = 0.84, Figure 11 ). Throughout the study period, approximately one third of the patients were female. Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 94 Figure 11: Gender and total number of the patient population from 2002 to 2013. The mean age in 2002 was 37.1 years, increasing linearly to 45.0 years in 2013 (R2 = 0.985, Figure 12 ). Female patients were younger than males in 2002 (35.8 vs. 37.8 years), but older in 2013 (46.5 vs. 44.4 years). For all reported years the age difference was not significant (U - Test, p > 0.05).

On average, women had insignificantly more substances than men. Age was not significantly associated with the number of substances (U -Test, p > 0.05). In 2002 and 2013, 39% and 58.4% of the patients received 3 or more substances, respectively. The mean number of medicines was slightly higher than the mean number of substances and increased from 2.89 (1 - 11) in 2002 to 3.86 in 2013 (1 - 15, Figure 13). Figure 13: Mean number of substances and medicines per patient from 2002 to 2013. The OAS dispensed 57 different substances in 2002 and 76 in 2013 ( Figure 14 ). Most substances were used in the therapy of the nervous system, including all substitution medication and methylphenidate preparations. An increase of substances was observed for treatments of the nervous system, the cardiovascular system, blood and hematopoietic system, muscular & skeletal system, and alimentary system & metabolism. In contrast, the use of substances for the urogenital tract, dermatology, and anti -infectives declined. 2.52.72.93.13.33.53.73.94.1number of substances/ medicines per patient year no. of substances no. of medicinesProject C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observati onal study 96 Figure 14: Total substances per year and therapeutic area from 2002 to 2013.

Opioid -substitution treatment Methadone was the predominant treatment for OAT . However, the use of methadone among other substitution treatments decreased by more than 25% from 97.32% in 2002 to 70.78% in 2013. It was mostly replaced by (12.3% remained at constant percentages below 10%. Pethidine was only used by one woman from 2003 to 2013 and 0 to 7 patients per year did not receiv e any OAT (Figure 16 ). Up to 6.5% of patients received a combination of two medications. The most common combinations were methadone with MST Continus\u00ae or Sevre -Long\u00ae. Figure 16: Subs titution medication of the patient population from 2002 to 2013 Methadone was available in three different galenic forms: liquid, solid, and semisolid. While most patients used methadone in its liquid form, its use decreased from 65.18% in 2002 to 40.26% i n 2013. The use of the solid form, i.e. tablets, remained constant between 32% and 42%. The use of the semisolid form (i.e. suppositories) was negligible. Three to six patients per year (1.95% - 4.46%) used a combination of the solid and the liquid form ( Figure 17 profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 98 Figure 17: The use of the galenic form of methadone from 2002 to 2013. The mean dose of OAT (methadone- equivalents) remained relatively constant at 114 mg (SD = 64.2 mg, range = 8.75 - 337.1 mg, Figure 18 ). Until 2011, men used an insignificantly higher mean dose than women.

More importantly, the predominant use of short -acting preparations in 2002 was fully replaced by long -acting preparations by 2011 ( Figure 19 ). After 2008, short - acting preparations were only used in combination with long -acting preparations. The mean dose varied around 50 mg per day but never exceeded 60 mg ( Figure 20 ).

Figure 20: Mean dose of methylphenidate preparations from 2002 to 2013. of of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 100 Discussion Our retrospective, longitudinal analysis of the claims database of an OAS in Basel, Switzerland, offered important insights about the development of the patient population between 2002 and 2013. First, we observed an increase in the number of patients, their age, and the number of medications. The phenomenon of an aging population with OAT has received global attention186, 196. The stable prevalence in Switzerland coincides with the decline in Heroin use in Switzerland and improved retention rates of OAT179, 184. Surprisingly, the increase in the number of substances was not associated with age. Although polypharmacy is often linked to age, this correlation may be an indirect one. Polypharmacy has been dir ectly correlated with comorbidities and chronic pain197. Patients receiving OAT often have multiple comorbidities from an early age. Furthermore, young drug addicts today differ from past generations: While in the past many otherwise healthy persons slithere d into opioid dependence, most patients entering treatment today have been psychiatrically ill before their substance abuse. Additionally, the awareness for comorbidities in patients receiving OAT may have increased and psychological and somatic investigat ions for patients entering treatment might surpass those in the past. The older patients remaining in treatment may be the healthiest proportion, surviving their sicker peers (Neyman bias). The observation that the assortment of substances used increased, but the proportion of somatic treatments remained stable also supports these assumptions. Nevertheless, many patients with substance -related disorders are prematurely aged as a result of the risks associated with substance abuse and suffer from chronic dis eases and psychosocial problems 187, 188. Notably, antiviral drugs were among most frequently dispensed medications for somatic treatmen ts. Second, Methadone remained the predominant substance for OAT , but its use declined by 25% during the observation period. This decline mainly affected the liquid formulation and has been compensated by an increase of sustained -release Morphine and Bupre norphine. This observation might be explained by the higher risk for drug -drug interactions and side effects observed with Methadone compared to Morphine or Buprenorphine. Additionally, sustained -release Morphine preparations have been approved for OAT in Switzerland as recently as in 2013. Hence, their use is expected to increase even more in the future. However, the cost of these formulations are a lot higher compared to the liquid Methadone solution. Moreover, the use of solid formulations has been discouraged in the past due to the higher risk of diversion of tablets and capsules, especially when they are dispensed in their original blister packaging. Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 101 Third, the use of Methylphenidate decreased during the observation period. Although the prevalence remained substantially higher than that of adult ADHD in the general population, the use by 16% of the study population is lower than the prevalence for adult A DHD suggested for opioid -dependent patients. Evidently, short -acting formulations have been conseque ntly replaced by long -acting formulations, a development facilitated by the approval of long -acting formulations for ADHD. This change was mainly driven by the high potential for abuse of short -acting formulations. The same trend has been observed in a nat ionwide study from Iceland among adult ADHD patients198. How ever, long -acting formulations do not abolish the risk of abuse entirely. Strengths and Limitations Our study has some strengths. We used a data set of high quality that has been consistently and uniformly in use since 2002. It contains data from a clearly defined population and the long retention in care ensures a good representation of longitudinal data. We report some limitations. First, we only used one reference day for each year. It was not possible to aggregate the data of every day to ensure complete coverage of the population. Therefore, some cases might be missing from the sample. However, we compared the data from each reference day to a second date for plausibility and did not find many discrepancies. Second, a discontinuation of therapy or an exit from the program is unapparent in the data. Additionally, the same patient may receive a different case number when re- entering OAT after dropping out. Third, we only covered medications dispensed by the OAS. The OAS is a psychiatric clinic and does no t routinely investigate or prescribe treatment for somatic diseases. Hence, our results most likely underestimate the number of medications prescribed to patients, especially with regards to somatic diagnoses. Fourth, we did not have indications for treatm ents, for example for Methylphenidate. This information might be important to explain changes in prescription patterns. Finally, our results show a large variability, indication a high diversity and potential heterogeneity of the study population. Apart fr om analysis of averages, it might be worthwhile to look at the extremes and evaluate single cases. Interpretation Although we showed a trend towards an aging population with OAT that has been linked to an increase in chronic conditions, we did not see a ge neral increase in somatic medications for these patients. We observed a peak in the number of substances and medications in 2008 that coincided with a higher proportion of somatic medications. It might be possible that one Project C2 | Medication profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 102 of the resident physicians put mo re attention towards somatic conditions compared to other years. Indeed, patients might visit other physicians and obtain additional medications from other sources. While this is likely the case for some patients, others may remain under - treated. The care for the ageing population with OAT has been reported to be insufficient 187, 196. A study from Germany indicated that the supply system for those patients needs adaption199. Moreover, Switzerland and other European countries face potential shortages of OAT providers200- 202. The consolidation of the treatment for older patients with OAT would most likely increase the safety and effectiveness of therapies. Additionally, the declining mobility of these patients warrants changes to the supply of medication. Daily or even weekly visits to a dispensing center might not be feasible for some pati ents. However, legislations restrict dispensing of OAT to short intervals. Yet, studies show that takeaway doses for extended periods improves treatment outcomes and retention in care for steady patients203, 204. Moreover, many nursing homes are not prepared to care for older patients with OAT205. Generali zability Our study considered only patients from one treatment center . Our results indicate a large variability of the sample in terms of age, number, and type of medications. Compared to a nationwide study reporting a mean age of 39.1 years in 2012, our sample was considerably older 202. Because the OAS is specialized to treat opioid- dependent patients with mental disorders, these may potentially show a higher complexity c ompared to other opioid - dependent patients. Nevertheless, our results are relevant to other settings, as the increasing age and associated complexity is observed globally. The high standards and evidence -based practices inherent to a university hospital ma y be reflected in an early adoption of new treatment options, such as sustained -release Morphine or Methylphenidate for Cocaine addiction. Thus, the prevalence of these treatments might differ in other settings. Yet, novel approaches might rapidly dissemin ate in a small country like Switzerland, as OAT is generally provided by specialists who engage in continuous education. Conclusion With our database analysis, we confirmed the globally observed shift towards an older population with OAT . Furthermore, we were able to show an increase in the number of substances and medications, leading to an increased risk of drug -drug interactions, adverse events, and non- adherence. Additionally, we observed a shift from the traditional OAT with Project C2 | Medic ation profiles of substituted patients with opioid dependence syndrome: A longitudinal observational study 103 liquid Methadone to solid formulations , such as Buprenorphine and sustained -release Morphine. Other disorders , such as ADHD , further complicate the safe and effective therapy of the complex patients. Taken together, the developments of the past 10 years call for new care models for older patients with OAT . The increasing age and complexity of their medication might warrant a closer collaboration of health care professionals. Alternative supply models to assist patients with their medication management and support medication adherenc e are needed for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy.

John (beginning dementia, 52 years, 6 tablets daily at 12 am) and Mary (frequent drug holidays, 48 years, 5 -6 tablets daily at 8 pm) suffered from disease progression due to non -adherence. We electronically monitored adherence and clinical outcomes during 659 (John) and 953 (Mary) days between July 2013 and April 2016. Both patients retrieved over 90% of the pouches wi thin 75 minutes of the scheduled time. Technical problems occurred in 4% (John) and 7.2% (Mary) of retrievals but support was seldom required. Viral loads fell below detection limits during the entire observation period. Continuous medication supply and pe rsistence with treatment of over 1.7 years, timing adherence of more than 90%, and suppressed HIV viral load are first results supporting the feasibility of the novel supply model for patients on opioid -assisted treatment and polypharmacy. Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 107 Background Along with the ageing of the general population, the number of older users of illicit substances (or older drug users) is also growing in Europe206 and in Switz erland186. Besides age-related comorbidities, which occur earlier than in the general population, they may be affected by chronic viral infec tions that can take decades to cause significant illness or death. Treatment of these conditions are expensive and require high adherence levels to be effective207. Medication adherence is \"the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed, composed of initiation, implementation and discontinuation\"208. Substance use itself has been reported to negatively affect adherence209- 214, and substance use disorders often coincide with multiple risk factors for medication non -adherence, such as psychiatric comorbidities215, low socioeconomic status38, lack of social support38, unemployment211, and unstable housing216. Non -adherence to medication has negative effects on health outcomes, and costs19. Opioid -assisted treatment (OAT) is the recommended treatment for opioid dependence217. It is efficacious, cost -effective and well tolerated218. In Switzerland, OAT is offered by a wide range of providers , such as general practitioners, specialized clinics, and addiction centres180. In the city of Basel, from the second treatm ent month onwards, individual take -home doses for up to 6 days per week are possible219. Because of the high frequency of mandatory visits and the distances between patients and providers, the provision of OAT is a daily challenge for patients and providers alike202. The outpatient addiction service (OAS) of the Psychiatric Hospital of the University of Basel, Switzerland, provides OAT and other medications for 220 patients, approximately 100 of which visit the service daily. Because existing nursing homes or home care services are often not suited or willing to accommodate pa tients with substance use disorders, outpatient treatment and surveillance are provided as long as possible. The deteriorating health of older drug users, the risks associated with non -adherence, and reduced mobility are putting considerable strain on exis ting resources. Thanks to regular appointments, caregivers may ensure initiation and persistence with treatments, but may not be able to assure correct implementation of the dosing regimen. Many patients take their medications irregularly due to a lack of structure in their daily routine. As a result, treatment success may be compromised, resulting in health risks not only for patients, but also for society. The cost of providing care to the ageing older drug users is expected to increase and innovative solutions to optimize medication management compatible with OAT are needed. In this context, we developed a novel medication supply model with interdisciplinary collaboration between the OAS, an HIV clinic, Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 108 and the Emergency Pharmacy of Basel, in order to guarantee adherence by using an electronic medication management aid (e- MMA) for pre -packed polypharmacy located at patients' homes. A qualitative analysis of the e -MMA suggests that patients with time - sensitive medication regimens or patients with dementi a could benefit the most92. We present first results of two cases followed over mor e than 2 years and draw lessons from the experiences. Case Presentation We present two cases of outpatients living in social housing in Basel who obtained medication including OAT from the OAS Basel. After some years, conventional care and adherence to med ication were questioned, especially after missed appointments and flares of HIV viral load. Both patients accepted the novel supply model and the electronic monitoring of the entire medication. Both patients consented to the publication of their cases. John was 50 years old when he entered the study on July 2, 2013. He had been diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 as a result of intravenous drug use. A liver biopsy in 2014 showed cirrhosis and severe activity due to chronic HCV infection and alcohol abuse (1 liter of beer per day; Metavir score F4, A3). He lost his girlfriend to suicide and lived with a friend who also suffered from substance -related disorders. He was unemployed and spent most of his days at home. After diagnosis of a long -QT syndrome in earl y 2013, he was switched from methadone to 1'200 mg (6 tablets) of long -acting morphine daily. Remaining treatment consisted of 5 tablets once daily: Ritonavir 100 mg, darunavir 2x 400 mg, tenofovir/emtricitabine 245 mg/200 mg, and pantoprazole 40 mg. Viral load reached 1000 copies per milliliter (copies/ml) during 2012 and early 2013. His viral load fell below detection limits after he was obliged to visit the OAS daily (instead of once weekly) to assure regular intake of his medication. However, he continu ed to miss appointments and the situation remained unsatisfactory for him and his caregivers. Evaluation in the local memory clinic revealed a diagnosis of moderate Alzheimer's disease and a moderate depressive episode. Mary was 46 years old when she entered the study on 18 August, 2013. She had been diagnosed with HIV at the age of 19. She suffered from hypertensive cardiopathy, chronic lymphedema in both legs, and suspected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She had a history of hepatitis C an d was a heavy smoker. Her OAT consisted of methadone ( 170 mg) and she received sustained -release methylphenidate ( 90 mg) for Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). She lived with a friend. Both were not working and rarely left Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 109 home. In 2012, she st arted to take her HIV medication only sporadically and stopped altogether in early 2013. As a result, her viral load increased sharply to over 250'000 copies/ml. A low CD4 count (< 200 x 109 cells) necessitated the introduction of a prophylaxis against Pne umocystis carinii in summer 2013. Her caregivers convinced her to resume therapy with the same treatment as before and her viral load started to decrease. She understood the need for treatment but lacked the motivation to adhere despite intensive psycholog ical support. At the time, additionally to OAT and methylphenidate, she was taking: Lopinavir/ ritonavir 200 mg/50 mg 4 tablets once daily, darunavir/ emtricitabine 245 mg/200 mg 1 tablet once daily, and sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim 800 mg/160 mg 1 tablet every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Her hypertension was not an issue at the time and an approach of watchful waiting was considered appropriate with the intention not to jeopardize adherence to HIV medication. Novel supply model and assessments Core el ement of the novel supply model is keeping the opioid -assisted treatment in the institution according to the existing law requirement, and delocalizing the remaining co - medication to the patient's home with an e- MMA (Medido\u00ae, Innospense BV, Netherlands; Figure 21 ). The remaining solid oral prescription medications were repackaged into unit -of- dose pouches with an Automatic Tablet Dispensing and Packaging System (ATDPS; Desk Type JV-30DE, HD- Medi, Germany). Each pouch is imprinted with the patient's name, date of birth, date and time for intake, as well as number, name, color , and shape of the medication contained ( Figure 22 ). Rolls of pouches for 1 -3 weeks are placed in the e -MMA, which reminded the patients with audiovisual alerts to take their medication . A web -based application allows to set the time of dispense individually according to participants' preferences. Pushing the OK- button stops the alarm and delivers the pouches with pre- packaged medication. A sensor in the dispenser registers a barcode printed on the top of each pouch and cuts the p ouches accordingly. Date and time of delivery are simultaneously recorded with GPRS -technology. Delivery of doses ahead of schedule (so -called pocket -doses) is feasible by pushing the OK -button for 5 seconds. This feature enables patient mobility, i.e. to be outside of home during scheduled intake times.

Note: Patient's name and date of birth were concealed for privacy re asons. The e -MMA was installed at the patients' homes by the responsible caregiver of the OAS and a pharmacist from PCRG (Figure 23). Patients were instructed in deta il about its proper use . They were also given a written manual including a telephone hotline number in case of problems with the dispenser. The hotline was operated by a pharmacist of the research group (SA or IA) during weekdays and by the Emergency Pharm acy during weekends and public holidays. Every 3 weeks, medications were repackaged according to the current treatment plan and the e- MMA was refilled during a pre -scheduled visit at the patient's home. If a patient failed to retrieve a dose from the dispenser within 75 minutes after the predefined time of intake, or in case of malfunctioning, the dispenser automatically sent an alert SMS to the hotline number. The pharmacist then contacted the patient by phone, inquired the Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 111 situation, acted accordingly (ei ther by remote action or by visiting the patient at home) and made sure that medication intake had been warranted. Primary outcomes were taking adherence assessed by electronic monitoring and HIV status (viral load, CD4 count) assessed during routine visit s in the HIV clinic. Electronic adherence data was analyzed and graphed with the statistical software R149. For taking adherence, we calculated frequencies of pre - dispense (doses dispensed before the scheduled time), regular dispense (doses dispensed during the 75 -minute scheduled interval), late dispense (doses dispensed more than 75 minutes after the first alarm), forgotten doses ( dispensed remotely after pharmacist intervention) and erroneous dispense (errors during dispense due to technical problems). Figure 23: Novel medication supply model where the community pharmacy provides unit -of-use pouches (medication roll Mo-Su) with all solid oral medications directly to patient home, except opioids for OAT and methylphenidate (S). The pouches are loaded into a lockable, remote -controlled dispenser that can be programmed according to a patient's medication schedule. The dispenser records dates and times of medication retrievals and wirelessly transmits them to a server (blue waves). Patients obtain the opioid agonist t herapy (S) from the o utpatient addiction service (OAS) in regular intervals, at least once weekly, according to local law requirements. Follow-up and outcomes The e -MMAs were installed in the kitchen (John) and in the living room (Mary). Dispense times wer e scheduled in line with consistent habits of daily life, i.e. 12 pm for John (first meal of the day) and 8 pm for Mary (watching TV). John was followed for 659 days. At the time of drafting of this article, Mary is still using the e -MMA. We present data from 953 days. Adherence was electronically monitored during 655 days (99.2%, John) and 911 days (95.6%, Mary; Table 9). Missing days (John: 0.8%, Mary: 4.4%) were due to technical problems with the dispenser.

For dementia, a therapy with the acetylcholine -esterase inhibitor donezepil was initiated in October 2013 and subsequently increased to the maximal do se of 10 mg. John was satisfied with the treatment and reported no adverse events. Still, he expressed concerns regarding the persistent cognitive problems - disorientation and forgetfulness. He retrieved 8 doses (1.2%) more than 75 minutes after the sched uled time and forgot to retrieve 4 doses (0.6%, Table 9 and Figure 24). This deviation was due to an appointment or a visit at the OAS, preventing him from being back home in time for the scheduled intake. His flat mate would sometimes retrieve the pouches and leave them on the counter for him (frequency not known). Errors during dispense of the pouches typically coincided with the end of a medication roll and did not require any intervention. Dementia remained stable (assessment in spring 2014) and the pattern of retrieved pouches from the dispenser did not change. With the exception of a blip in November 2013, his viral load remained suppressed below 20 copies/ml and CD4 c ells continued to rise ( Figure 25). In April 2015, his flat mate suddenly died and the patient decided together with the care staff of the OAS that he would not continue to live independently. He moved to a supervised care home that adopted his medical care and medication supply with the dispenser was therefore terminated.

White areas are days with missing electronic monitoring (John: 0.8%, Mary: 4.4% of all days) During the first months, Mary experienced several technical problems. Pouches sometimes got stuck in the dispenser, or the dispenser would cut the pouches in the wrong area, which required a visit to the pat ient for reconfiguration of the dispenser. Despite these issues, the patient was grateful for the intervention and reported regular intake of the medication. In early 2014, viral load fell below detection limits and CD4 counts started to rise ( Figure 25 ). After one year, the dispenser was replaced and technical difficulties that required attention of the pharmacist ceased almost completely ( Figure 24 ). In instances where technical problems still caused the device to improperly cut pouches, the patient would help herself using scissors. Although she was requested to immediately call the ho tline in case of technical issues, Mary would only mention them during the three -weekly refill visits. Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 114 Figure 25: HIV viral load and CD4 cell count of John and Mary. Start of electronic monitoring is marked with an arrow. In December 2015, Mary mentioned that when she was busy in the flat and the alarm would ring, she would sometimes press the OK -button to retrieve the pouches, but would walk away and go back to her business. Sometimes, she would then forget to take the medications later and save the pouches in a drawer. Between May and December 2015, she reportedly skipped 21 days of medication (10% over 8 months). Because viral load was constantly suppressed and CD4 counts recovered, prophylaxis of Pn eumocystis carinii was discontinued in September 2015. In spring 2016, home visits for dispenser refill were discontinued. The medication rolls were delivered to the OAS where Mary would pick them up during her regular visits and load them into the dispens er at home. At the time of drafting of this article (November 2016), appointments are kept and the laboratory results are Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 115 Discussion A novel medication supply model with electronic adherence monitoring of polypharmacy showed sustained treatm ent implementation and suppressed viral loads in two opioid - dependent HIV patients over 1.7 and 2.5 years, respectively. The drop of viral loads started when patients resumed therapy after intervention of their caregivers. It has been demonstrated that adh erence interventions for long -term treatments need regular follow -ups to remain effective 220. However, the intensive care to assure adherence for John was not sustainable on the long term, and correct implementation of the treatment regimen was not guaranteed for Mary. Our novel supply model offered a sustainable solution t o assure adequate implementation and persistence with treatment. In line with our findings, larger trials of such devices suggest an improvement of adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with kidney transplants 79 and schizophrenia77. These trials, however, were usually of shorter duration and did not focus on implementation of dosing regimens. Additionally, repackaging of medications in unit -of-use pouches might prevent disturbance in case of changes in treatment , such as the up -titration of anti -dementia therapy, or initiati ng of preventive and irregular treatment, e.g., the prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii. Adapting the content of the pouches is possible without modifying the intake habits. This insures that changes in treatment do not coincide with variable intake times and thus might prevent non-adherence. Electronic monitoring makes changes in dosing patterns instantly apparent and allows for a timely intervention. Feedback from electronic monitoring has been shown to effectively improve adherence 62. The only prerequisite is a system entirely reliable and without deficiencies to avoid interference with measurements. We experienced technical problems that compromised monitoring and increased workload for the care staff. These were unpredictable, not reproducible, and complicated the care process. As a consequence, caregivers received unsuspected alerts that could not be ignored. Nevertheless, patients declared satisfaction with the novel supply model, probably because the technical problems did not jeopardize medication intake. Our study has several strengths. First, we included patients from a population with a high probability of non- adherence and a high prevalence of time- sensitive medication regimens, such as highly active anti -retroviral therapy (HAART) for HIV. Thus, the s uccess of our intervention in these complex patients demonstrates the potential of our supply model. Second, we measured adherence to polypharmacy. Typically, devices for electronic monitoring are designed for single preparations. The monitoring of polypha rmacy thus Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland fr om two case reports 116 requires multiple devices and may complicate the management of medications. With our e - MMA, all medications were dispensed in unit -of-use pouches, which enhanced the likelihood of concurrent intake. We acknowledge some limitations. First, measur ing adherence with the e -MMA might overestimate adherence because medication retrieval does not equal ingestion. Literature suggests that electronic monitoring might underestimate adherence221, although the contrary has also been argued222. The latter s eems more plausible in our cases. Mary, for example, retrieved all of her pouches on time but set them aside and forgot to take at least 10% of them during an 8 -month period. The greater the distance (time and place) between electronic monitoring and actua l ingestion of the medication, the higher the risk of false -positive results. With the electronic dispenser, the signal is generated when patients press the button to stop the alarm and to retrieve the pouches. During the few seconds of dispensing and cutt ing the pouch, the patient may walk away and forget the intake later on. Furthermore, patients or other persons living in the same household might press the button to stop the alarm without the intention of taking their medication. Consequently, intentiona l non -adherence must be ruled out before using this kind of an e -MMA. Other systems , such as electronic punch cards (POEMS 37), measure the emptying of a cavity directly before ingestion and are thus less likely to overestimate actual intake of tablets and distort the measurement of adherence. Second, although John and Mary experienced a benefit from the dispenser, case reports cannot generate results to claim effectiveness of an intervention. Additionally, the generalizability of our results is limited. We evaluated the e -MMA in two patients that matched the envisaged target groups suggested in a qualitative study of the dispenser. Living conditions like mobility could pose a barrier to acceptance of the stationary dispenser 92. This might be less of an issue in opioid -dependent patients who often have no employment. Recent data from a Swiss survey indicate unemployment rates of 50% among patients with OAT 202. However, patients not matching the envisaged target groups may also benefit from the novel supply model and further studies should evaluate this. Finally, we did not evaluate the financial implications of the novel supply model. Costs for repackaging of medications are reimbursed in Switzerland for patients with polypharma cy (i.e. more than 3 medications during 4 months). Costs of the e- MMA and additional costs for service and support are currently not reimbursed by health insurances. However, savings from improved adherence might offset the additional costs, as shown in pr evious studies where better adherence resulted in significant cost savings 223, 224. Project C3 | Novel remote electronic medication supply model for opioid -dependent outpatients with polypharmacy - first long -term experiences in Switzerland from two case reports 117 Conclusion Continuous medication supply and persistence with treatment over more than 1.7 years, timing adherence of more than 90%, and suppressed HIV viral load are first results supporting the feasibility of the novel supply model. Further trials should aim at evaluating the effectiveness of the supply model in terms of clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes and in patients that do not necessarily match the envisaged target groups.

As a result, they often need to deal with polypharmacy and complex regimens. Together with a high prevalence of psychological problems and low social support, these patients are at high risk for medication non - adherence, especially during the implementation phase. Electronic medication management aids (e -MMA) might be appropriate to simulta neously monitor and improve implementation of dosing regimens for these patients. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate for the first time a quantitative and qualitative (mixed - method ) single -subject study design to investigate the use of an e -MMA in patients on opioid - assisted treatment (OAT) with polypharmacy. Methods: Five patients from an o utpatient addiction service (OAS) in n orthern Switzerland participated in a sequential multiple -baseline single subject study. We used an e- MMA with prepackaged unit -of-use pouches to monitor adherence during a baseline phase. An intervention phase with built -in audible and visual reminders from the e -MMA started response -guided after a minimum of 4 weeks. After completion, participants entered a follow -up phase with or without e -MMA. Primary outcome was taking adherence, defined as the proportion of correctly retrieved pouches in relation to prescribed doses. Secondary outcomes were proportion of pouches retrieved within 75 minutes before or after agreed dosing times (timing adherence), pre -dispenses, missed dispenses, errors during dispenses, time variability of dispenses , clinical outcomes when available from routine assessments, humanistic outcomes, and satisfaction with the e -MMA. We used visual analysis to assess adherence measures. Data were aggregated in weekly windows and linear regression was used to estimate trends. Other quantitative outcomes were compared between pre- and post - intervention phases. Qualitative outc omes were analyzed descriptively. Results: Between November 2014 and August 2015, 3 women and 2 men with a mean age of 48 years, taking in addition to OAT a median of 7 medications during 3 dosing times per day were included in the study. The median obser vation period was 160 days with electronic monitoring. Three participants completed the whole study, one deceased after 14 weeks during the intervention phase (death unrelated to the study) and one withdrew during the baseline phase because he entered stat ionary treatment. An intervention phase with intake reminder was implemented for two participants. During the entire study period, the median taking adherence was 88%. Participants retrieved a median of 61% pouches within the Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 121 dosing intervals (regular disp ense), 26% more than 75 minutes before the agreed dosing times (pre -dispense), and 9.2% more than 75 minutes after the agreed dosing time (missed dispense). Errors during dispense occurred in 2.8% of retrievals. The average time variability of retrieval (t Var) was 88 \u00b1 33 minutes. For both patients completing the intervention phase, taking adherence increased by more than 25% to almost 100% and no missed doses were observed when audible and visual reminders were introduced. Timing adherence initially improv ed dramatically, but trended towards baseline -levels during the intervention period. Conversely, pre -dispenses and time variability were stable during the baseline phase and showed increasing trends during the intervention phase. Clinical outcomes were ava ilable for 3 participants. Physical and Mental Quality of life were below average for all participants and varied considerably between measurements. Generally, clinical and humanistic outcomes remained unchanged during the study period for all participants. Participants accepted the e- MMA, especially for the security of having enough medication at home, the possibility to pre - dispense pocket -doses, and the assurance of regular intakes. No adverse events linked to the e-MMA were observed. Conclusions: Participants in our single -subject study showed high taking adherence and sufficient timing adherence when using the e- MMA. The e -MMA may ensure correct implementation of dosing regimens for opioid -substituted patient s with polypharmacy when certain prerequisites are considered. Various drawbacks limit the applicability of the device to monitor adherence. A careful assessment of patient's barriers to medication adherence and a structured medication review should be the first steps when considering the use of the e - MMA for a patient with OAT . Overall, the flexibility of single- subject research designs offers considerable advantages for the evaluation of adherence interventions. Project C 4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 122 Introduction Older opioid -dependent pati ents are a manifold vulnerable group. Due to their history of drug abuse and its associated lifestyle, patients often appear prematurely aged and suffer from chronic diseases and disability, such as a rthritis, hypertension, chronic lung disease, stomach ulcers, coronary heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus187. Additionally, the prevalence of chronic infections , such as Hepatitis B and C or h uman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) , are significantly higher compared to the general population183, 184 ,188. Consequently, many older patients with OAT often need additional long -term medications, resulting in polypharmacy and complex regimens. Together with a high prevalence of psychological problems and low social support, these patients are at high risk for medication non- adherence. Medication adherence is \"the process by which patients take their medications as prescribed, composed of initiation, implementation and discontinuation\" 22. Persistence describes the time period between the first dose (initiation) and after the last dose (discontinuation). However, being persistent does not mean that patients' actual dosing corresponds to the prescribed regimen (implementation). Correct implementation is important for patients with opioid dep endence syndrome, not only to assure optimal treatment of psychiatric or somatic illnesses, but also to minimize dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Adherence management is the \"process of monitoring and supporting patients' adherence to medications by hea lth care systems, providers, patients, and their social networks\" 22. Thus, management of adherence always requires the monitoring of said behavior and an adequate intervention to improve adherence if needed. Measurement of a dherence is challenging: it has to be feasible for patients, valid, reliable and objective, continuous, not invasive, easy to administer and analyze , cover multiple medications, affordable , sustainable, and generalizable23. Currently, no existing method satisfies all these criteria. In contrast to most other methods, such as direct measurem ent of drug concentrations in the blood or urine, pill count, pha rmacy refill data, self -report, electronic monitoring meets almost all the requirements. A multitude of interventions to improve adherence have been studied . Generally, the evidence for the p lethora of adherence interventions across conditions remains week, due to the large heterogeneity and methodological problems220, 225, 226. The strongest effects are reached when patients actively participate in the choice of therapy, take on responsibility for self-care, and receive social support 227. A Cochrane- review assessed the use of interventions Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mi xed-methods single -subject study 123 that intend to remind patients to take their medication by packaging solid, oral medications into unit -of-use doses (\"reminder -packaging\")64. They found a mean improvement of adherence of 10% in patients using reminder -packaging systems. The use of electronic reminders , such as short message service (sms) or audiovisual reminder devices, was effective in improving short -term adherence (less than 6 months), but long -term effects remain unclear65. In a systematic review of adherence intervention studies using electronic monitoring to assess adherence, only interventions containing feedback of electronic monitoring and/or a cognitive -educational component were effective 62. In summary, interventions enabling patients to actively participate and take responsibility for self -care, using reminder -packaging, electronic reminders, and adherence feedback, may be feasible to improve adherence. Electron ic medication management aids (e -MMA) fulfil these criteria and might additionally be feasible for the electronic monitoring of medication adherence. Little is known about the adherence of opioid dependent patients to their medication. Few cohort studies f rom Switzerland and France assessed self -reported adherence of HIV -infected drug users during the past 4 and 1 weeks, respectively 228, 229. Patients with stable opioid substitution therapy report significantly higher adherence (70.9% declare full adherence) than patients without substitut ion (54.8%) 228. Some argue that the frequent contacts with a dispensing institution required for OAT have a positive influence on therapy adherence230. In contrast, other studies have shown that contingen t take -home doses of substitution medication improve therapy attendance203, 204, 231. In another study, full adherence was guaranteed by using b uprenorphine for opioid substitution as subcutaneous implant232. After 24 weeks, the fraction of urine samples negative for opioids were 2 5% compared to 13% in the control group and participants had higher study completion rates, lower clinician -rated and patient -rated withdrawal, lower patient -rated craving, and better clinician -rated and patient -rated global improvements. These studies all address adherence to substitution therapy. However, evidence for interventions to improve adherence to additional medications not intended for substitution therapy remains scarce . Due to the complexity of their situations, (older) patients with substance -related disorders are regularly excluded from studies investigating medication adherence220. The abovementioned e -MMAs might be appropriate to simultaneously monitor and improve implementation of dosing regimens for these patients . Two case reports of opioid -substituted HIV patients using an e-MMA showed consistent high adh erence, suppressed viral load, and sustained persistence over more than 2 years94. In a study assessing an e -MMA in home care, participants accepted the device as \"very easy to use, very reliable and helpful in the management of their medications\"167. The Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 124 final report on another project with e -MMAs aiming at improving self -management among non- adherent patients concluded that \"anyone who has difficulty remembering to take their medication\" may benefit from such an intervention168. In contrast to cohort studies and RCTs, case studies, single -subject research designs, and N -1 RCTs are applied to individual patients rather than groups of patients. They have been described to be particularly useful to implement in clinical practice and to assess behavioral interventions 233. It is important to note that case studies are not identical to case reports. While the former follows a predefined research methodology, the latter describes clinical practice and does not involve research methodology 233. Single -subject research designs are (quasi -)experiments where individual subjects serve as their own control. Carefully selected variables are systematically observed, measured, graphed, and an alyzed over time. During baseline and intervention phases, the variables are repeatedly measured. The literature recommends at least 5 repeated measures before introducing the treatment (intervention phase). Usually, the graphed data are analyzed visually regarding their level, trend, and variability between the baseline and intervention phases. This approach offers the advantage that it is readily understood by clinicians, patients, and researchers. Goal and aims Our goal was the first -time evaluation of a quantitative and qualitative (mixed -method) single -case study design to investigate the use of an e -MMA in opioid -substituted patients with polypharmacy. Our aims were to develop and evaluate the study design with regards to : participant's adherence with an e- MMA the effect of intake reminders on adherence patterns the effect of the e -MMA on clinical and humanistic outcomes participants' acceptance of and satisfaction with the e- MMA Methods Design We applied a sequential multiple -baseline single subject design. Participants completed a baseline phase where the e- MMA was only used to measure adherence (phase A), followed by an intervention phase with intake reminders (phase B), and a follow -up phase with or without the e -MMA (up to 6 months). The intervention phase started response- guided after a minimum of 4 weeks when patients were accustomed to the e -MMA. To maximize external Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitutio n Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 125 validity, we used systematic inter -subject replication across multiple pa rticipants. Participants and researchers were not blinded to study phase or assessments. The study is reported according to the SCRIBE criteria for the reporting of single -case studies of behavioral interventions234. Setting The study was conducted in a mid -sized city ( > 165'000 inhabitants) in north western Switzerland between November 2014 and August 2016. We recruited patients from the outpatient addiction service (OAS) of the Psychiatric University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The setting and population have been described elsewhere93. Briefly, the OAS offers treatment to patients with substance use disorders, mental and somatic disorders, and social impairments and problems. Up to 100 patients per day visit the public dispensing point of the clinic to obtain their medication. Patients take t heir (substitution) medication on site under supervision at least once per week and receive additional doses and medications for take-home. During the study, all medications except substitution medication were provided by the emergency pharmacy of Basel (N otfallapotheke Basel). The community pharmacy is located next to the University hospital and is open between 5 pm and 8 am during weekdays, and 24 hours during weekends and public holidays. Participants Participants were recruited by the care staff of the OAS during routine visits. Patients were considered for inclusion according to inclusion criteria ( Table 10 ) when their caregiver deemed them suitable. Table 10: Inclusion and exclusion criteria Inclusion criteria written informed consent given reading and writing skills in German stable housing situation in the canton of Bas el-City and adjacent municipalities accessibility by phone minimum duration in opioid substitution treatment for 2 months polypharmacy (> 3 solid oral medications) routine monitoring of clinical parameters less than 1 week before inclusion or agreed within 1 week from inclusion insured with Swiss health insurance Exclusion criteria opioid substitution treatment with Diacetylmorphine more than 2 drugs that cannot be packaged in pouches ( e.g., liquids) Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 126 Approvals This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of northwestern Switzerland (EKNZ 2014 - 071). A written informed consent form was handed to participants, discussed, and signed before beginning the initial baseline assessment. The study protocol has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (ID NCT02701660). Materials and p rocedures An Automatic Tablet Dispensing and Packaging System (ATDPS; Desk Type JV- 30DE, HD- Medi, Germany) located at the Emergency Pharmacy in Basel was initially used to repack all solid oral prescription medications except substitution trea tment for each participant into unit -of-dose pouches. Each pouch was imprinted with the patient's name, date of birth, date and time for intake, as well as number, name, color, and shape of the medication contained (Figure 26). If the treatment included medications that were taken on demand, the full daily dose was repackaged into a single pouch. Starting from March 2015, the pouches were repackaged by a large blister center in northwestern Switzerland (Medifilm AG, Oensingen) and delivered to the Emergency Pharmacy. The dispenser (Medido\u00ae, Innospense BV, Netherlands) was a remote controlled e- MMA reminding the patients with audible and visual alerts to t ake their medication ( Figure 27). Pushing the OK -button stops the alarm and delivers the pouches with pre -packaged medication. A sensor in the dispense r registers a barcode printed on the top of each pouch and cuts the pouches accordingly. Delivery of doses up to 24 hours ahead of schedule is possible by pushing the OK -button for 5 seconds. This important feature allows pocket -doses that enable patients to go out of the house during intake times. Date and time of delivery are simultaneously recorded with GPRS -technology and stored in a secure server. We used these data to assess adherence.

Intervention The supply of medication through the e -MMA required a novel supply mod el that was organized in collaboration with the OAS, the Pharmaceutical Care Research Group (PCRG) of the University of Basel, and the Emergency Pharmacy of Basel, Switzerland ( Figure 28). Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 128 Figure 28: In this medication supply model, the pharmacy provides unit -of-use pouches of all solid oral prescription medications except substitution treatment directly to patients' homes. The pouches are l oaded into a lockable, remote - controlled dispenser that can be programmed according to a patient's medication schedule. The dispenser records dates and times of medication retrievals and wirelessly transmits them to a server. Patients collected their opioid substitution therapy from the OAS in regular intervals, at least once weekly, according to local law requirements. The dispenser was installed at the participants' homes and patients were instructed about its proper use. They were given a written manual including a telephone hotline number in case of problems or difficulties with the e -MMA. The hotline was operated by a pharmacist of the PCRG during weekdays and by the emergency pharmacy during weekends and public holidays. Every 3 weeks, medications were repackaged according to the current treatment plan and the e- MMAs were refilled during a pre -scheduled visit at the patients' homes (Figure 29). Dosing times were discussed, set according to participants' preferences, and adjusted during the study period if needed. Participants were allowed to retrieve doses not more than 24 hours prior than the agreed dosing time. During baseline phases, the alarm was inaudible and set to at least 2 hours after the agreed dosing times. Participants were instructed to retrieve the pouches at the agreed dosing time autonomously and immediately before intake by pushing the OK -button . For the intervention phase, the alarm was switched on for the agreed dosing times and patients were instructed to retrieve the pouches when the alarm sounded and immediately ingest their medication. In case of malfunctioning, or if a patient missed to retrieve a dose from the dispenser wi thin 75 minutes during the intervention phase, the dispenser would automatically send an alert to the responsible pharmacist. The pharmacist would then contact the patient and make sure that medication intake was warranted. Patients continued to collect th eir substitution medication from the OAS once Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 129 weekly according to legal requirements. To assure procedural fidelity, standard operation procedures (SOPs) were developed and used for all steps. Figure 29: Course of the study. OAS: Outpatient A ddiction Service , PCRG: Pharmaceutical Care Research Group Measures Our primary outcome measure was taking adherence during the implementation phase, defined as the proportion of correctly retrieved pouches in relation to prescribed doses between dispenser installation (T 2) and end of intervention (T 4, Figure 29). Since the e -MMA guaranteed dispen sing of every dose, we defined correct dispensing when a dose was retrieved before or within the predefined time interval for dispensing. The time interval was set to a grace period of 75 minutes after the agreed dosing time. If a patient retrieved a dose after the grace period, it was considered as missed. In case of multiple intake times per day, each dose was counted separately. Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 130 Our secondary outcome measures were: Dosing patterns ( between T2 and T4) continuous assessment with e -MMA frequencies of pre-dispense ( doses retrieved > 75 minute s before the agreed dosing time) regular dispense ( doses retrieved within 75 minutes before or after the agreed dosing time; timing adherence) missed dispense ( doses retrieved more than 75 minut es after the agreed dosing time) erroneous dispense ( errors during dispense due to technical problems ) Time -variability of medication retrieval (tVar235; between T2, and with e -MMA Self-reported adherence (T1, T4, T5) translated and adapted versions Quality of Life (QoL; T1, T3, T4, T5) Physical and Mental Composite Scores (PCS, MCS) of the SF -12 self -report questionnaire237 Psychological distress (T 1, T4, T5) SCL-90R Lawton -Brody239 Satisfaction (T 3, T4) self-report questionnaire at T 4 interviews during T 3 with the follow ing questions about the e -MMA: o What did you ex perience since the last refill? o When did the e -MMA bother you? o When have you been glad about the e - MMA? Individual clinical outcomes ( e.g., blood pressure, blood sugar, HIV count; between T1 and T5) only for participants completing the study when available from routine assessments Analyses As recommended for single -subject research, we used visual analysis for electronic adherence measures. Visual inspection of the graphed data allows to draw conclusions about the intervention effects240. For this first exploratory study, we found this to be the most appropriate method to assess reliability and consistency of intervention effects. In case of multiple intake times per day, we aggregated the dosing patterns and averaged the time - variability of medication retrieval (t Var) for all scheduled intake times235. Raw adherence patterns (dosing times and types) were plotted for all participants. We plotted weekly Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 131 adherence patterns for the two participants with distinct baseline and intervention phases. For this purpose, frequencies of pre -dispense, regular dispense, and late dispense, along with tVar were aggregated in weekly intervals and graphed. Windows with less than 4 days (e.g., at the end of baseline and intervention phases) were not included for analyses because of insufficient comparability. Trend lines for baseline and intervention phases were calculated using linear regression. We used the statistical Software R for processing of the raw dispenser data, for calculations, and for graphing149. Other quantitative outcomes (Quality of Life [QoL] , Psychological distress, IADL, clinical outcomes) were compared individually between pre- and post -intervention phases. Questionnaires regarding patient satisfaction and adherence were analyzed descriptively. Patient interviews were audio -taped, ver batim transcribed, and analyzed with MaxQDA (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany). A combination of inductive and deductive content analyses was applied based on earlier research with the same e- MMA 92. Participants' statements about satisfaction with the dispenser were coded into the themes \"patient support\", \"product design\", and \"living conditions\"92. Results Participants Between November 2014 and August 2015, five patients accepted to participate in the study. Participants (three female, two male ), had a mean age of 48 years (34 - 68), took a median of 7 medications during 3 dosing times per day (excluding OAT), and spent on average 70% (30%-1 00%) of their weekdays at home ( Table 11). Participants received a median of 10 (5 - 15) refill visits with an interquartile range (IQ R) of 6 during a median observation period of 160 days (39 -253, IQR = 87). A median 85.5% of days were electronically monitored (80.4%- 93.5%, IQR = 5.3, Table 12). All participants experienced periods without retrieval of the pouches from the e -MMA. Reasons for interruptions were holidays, hospitalizations , or technical difficulties with the e -MMA. Du ring interruptions, participants used the pouches without the dispenser or received medications in the hospital or from other sources (e.g., OAS).

They received no or little support from family and friends (Brunhilde, Carmen, Albert, and Denise), or a l ot (Erdin). Their satisfact ion with the support from family and friends was high (Carmen, Brundhilde, and Albert) or low (Denise and Erdin). Brunhilde and Erdin reported frequent missed intakes during the past 4 weeks, Carmen reported occasional missed int akes, and Albert and Denise reported no missed intakes. Three participants completed the whole study (Carmen, Albert, and Denise). Brunhilde deceased after 14 weeks during week 8 of the intervention phase (death unrelated to the study) and Erdin withdrew after 6 weeks during the baseline phase because he entered stationary treatment. An intervention phase with intake reminder was implemented for Brunhilde and Carmen. All other participants did not use the intake reminders of the dispenser. Albert pre -dispe nsed all doses at the earliest moment possible, Denise wanted to use her own mobile phone as an alarm because she did not like the sound of the dispenser, and Erdin withdrew during the baseline phase. Adherence patterns and effect of intake reminders During the entire study period, the median taking adherence was 88%. Participants retrieved a median 61 % of pouches within the dosing intervals (regular dispense), 26 % more than 75 minutes before the agreed dosing times (pre -dispense), and 9.2 % more than 75 minutes after the agreed dosing time (missed dispense). Errors during dispense occurred in 2.8 % of retrievals. The average time variability of retrieval (t Var) was 88 \u00b1 33 minutes.

Simultaneously, she had a high proportion of pre -dispenses, especially for the morning doses. During the baseline phase, Carmen was hospitalized for 12 days during which she did not use the dispenser. She entered the intervention phase after 9 weeks and as a result, missed dispenses decreased from 30% (baseline) to zero ( intervention phase, Table 13 ). Her dispensing pattern was relatively stable during the baseline phase ( Figure 31 ). After entering the intervention phase, regular disp enses initially increased by more than 40% but showed a decreasing trend towards the end of the intervention phase. Contrary, pre-dispenses showed an upward trend during the intervention phase. T Var varied between 43 min and 138 min but was overall stable during the baseline phase. During the intervention phase, t Var varied greatly between 3 min and 225 min with an increasing trend towards the end of the intervention phase ( Figure 31 ).

Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 136 Brundhilde missed almost 20% of doses during the baselin e phase, especially in the evenings ( Figure 32 ). She entered the intervention phase with intake reminders after 5 weeks and as a result, missed dispenses decreased to 1.5% during the intervention phase (Table 13 ). Similarly, time variability halved from 108 to 57 minutes. She was hospitalized 2 weeks after start of the intervention phase and entered psychiatric rehabilitation shortly after her hospital stay. During this period, she was not able to use the dispenser. After her return home, she continued to show high taking adherence ( Figure 33 ). Figure 32: Time of medication retrieval for Brunhilde recorded with electronic monitoring. White areas are days with missing electronic monitoring. While her dispensing pattern was relatively stable during the baseline phase, frequencies of regular dispenses and pre -dispenses varied greatly during the intervention phase ( Figure 33). However, this can partly be explained by the participant's instability in March 2015 whe n she sometimes retrieve d pocket -doses before entering the hospital or psychiatric rehabilitation. While conforming to the schedule during the first weeks of the int ervention phase, she started to pre -dispense her evening painkillers in the morning. Since she did not want the dispenser to sound an alarm too early in the morning, her morning dose of painkillers was scheduled for retrieval in the evening.

Blue lines depict linear trends, with grey areas indicating the 95% -confidence interval. Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 138 Albert pre-dispensed almost all pouches at the earlies t moment possible, 24 hours prior to schedule (97.9%, Figure 34 and Table 13 ). He did not use the e -MMA as an intake reminder, but he needed support to organize his medication management, mainly to prevent him from overusing methylphenidate. Days without monitoring oc curred often due to frequent short holidays, especially after he left the therapeutic living community in April 2015 and moved into his own flat. Additionally, he reported that the e- MMA was stolen twice, although the truthfulness of his claims were never confirmed. His dispensing pattern did not change considerably during the study period. T Var varied between 1.64 and 206 minutes (mean 65 min) and showed a downward trend during the study period ( Figure 42 in Appendix A.3.9 ). Figure 34: Time of medication retrieval for Albert recorded with electronic monitoring. White areas are days with missing electronic monitoring. Denise showed a high timing adherence (62.4%, Table 13 ). Similar t o Albert, she did not use the e -MMA as an intake reminder but relied on her own mobile phone for alarms. After a few weeks, she did not longer want her thyroid hormones to be included in the pouches because she preferred to take them from the original pill bottle . As a result, she no longer had two monitored intake times. Possibly due to the size of her tablets, she experienced frequent errors during bag dispense, which led to two unmonitored intervals ( Figure 35 ). Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 139 Figure 35: Time of medication retrieval for Denise recorded with electronic monitoring. White areas are days with missing electronic monitoring. With 53 minutes, her overall t Var was the lowest of all participant s, possibly explained by the additional reminders from her mobile phone. Her dispensing pattern varied during the study period but no clear trends were ob served ( Figure 43 in Appendix A.3.9 ). Erdin pre-dispensed his Figure 44/Figure 45 in Appendix A.3.9 ). Similar to Albert, he did not use the e- MMA as an intake reminder, but to prevent him from overconsuming, in his case Benzodiazepines. In contrast to Albert, who complied with the restrictions imposed by the e -MMA, he tried to bypass t he dose restriction and retrieve the pouches manually using tweezers or tongs. When he realized that the e -MMA would not prevent him from overconsumption, he withdrew from the study and entered stationary treatment. Effect of the e -MMA on clinical and humanistic outcomes Clinical outcomes were available for Carmen, Albert, and Denise ( Table 14). Generally, clinical and humanistic outcomes remained stable during the study period for all participants with available outcome measures. Albert's Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Score indicated serious impairment in judgement and delusional influence on behavior and did not considerably change between phas es. Vitamin levels of Carmen decreased between T 1 and T 4 but rose to normal levels at T 5. HIV RNA remained suppressed for Denise throughout the study period.

Typically, physical quality of life (PCS) remained stable during the intervention period, but was lower at follow -up (T 5). Mental quality of life (MCS) increased between T 1 and T 4, and decreased during follow up ( Table 15). All patients considerably suffered from psychological distress. For Albert and Denise, the Global Severity Index (GSI) and Positive Symptom Distress Index (PSDI) decreased while using the e -MMA. In contrast, GSI and PSDI increased for Carm en (Table 15). Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) varied between 3 and 8 points across participants, with 8 being the maximal possible score. Carmen and Denise were independent except for medication responsibility. Albert scored 5 points at inclusion, indicating a medium level of dependence with deficiencies in the areas cooking, medication, and finances. His score improved during the stu dy period (for cooking and finances) and reached independence in all areas at follow -up T 5 when he did not use the dispenser anymore. No adverse events linked to the e- MMA were observed.

However, they expressed different opinions about the e -MMA during interviews and in the satisfaction questionnaire at the end of the study period ( Table 16). All patients mentioned that the e -MMA gave them the security that they had enough medication at home and they appreciated the possibility to pre -dispense pocket -doses. Table 16: Participants' positive and negative statements about the e-MMA Experiences with the e -MMA regarding... Participant ... Patient Support ... Product Design ... Living Conditions Carmen Positive: assured regular intake, medications were well organized, encouraged her to get up, gave her security that she had enough medication Negative: could still forget medication intake Negative: Alarm woke her up Positive: independence, possibility of pre -dispensing pocket -doses Negative: inconvenience when busy with other things Brunhilde Positive: assured regular intake, gave her security that she had enough medication Negative: something new forced upon her Positive: worked reliably (after initial technical problems) Negative: Alarm woke her up Positive: possibility of pre - dispensing pocket doses Negative: Inconvenient to reach when in pain Albert Positive: presence of e -MMA acted as a reminder to take medication, hel ped to organize his weekly dose, gave him security that he had enough medication, relieved him from carrying a lot of medication around Positive: worked reliably, was hygienic, and he would be able to break it in case of emergency to get to his medication Positive: independence, did not have to rely on other people for his medication, possibility of pre -dispensing pocket -doses Negative: inflexibility in case of special requests, not mobile, dependent on the dispenser Denise Positive: pre-packed medication, easy to use, assures regular intake, especially when feeling tired, gave her security that she had enough medication Negative: loss of control over medication Positive: hygienic Negative: produces unnecessary waste, unpleasant sound , gets in the way, table ts fall out of the pouch, technical issues, alarm woke her up Positive: less messy (no medication packages or pill boxes lying around), possibility of pre -dispensing pocket doses Erdin Positive: controlled dispense, gave him security that he had enough medication Negative: technical problems, does not prevent him from accessing medication Positive: possibility of pre - dispensing pocket doses Participants finishing the study (Albert, Carmen, an d Denise) reported overall satisfaction with the e-MMA . None of the participants felt uncomfortable during home visits or reported constraints in social life or contacts with caregivers from the OAS. Carmen and Albert rated support with their medication as satisfactorily , knew who to contact in case of issues, felt that issues were resolved promptly, and wanted to continue to use the e- MMA. Only Denise experienced persisting technical problems that were not adequately addressed. Only Albert Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patient s with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 142 reported trouble s with visits to the OAS for medication dispense and he wished to also receive OAT from the e -MMA. Carmen reported problems with motivation to take certain medications for malnutrition and expected the e- MMA to support regular intake. She was satisfied wit h the novel supply model because her medications were pre- packaged according to a regular schedule and she remained independent. She reported high satisfaction with the regular intake reminders and mentioned that the dispenser helped her to \"pick herself u p\" and structure her day sometimes. On the other hand, the alarms were sometimes inconvenient, especially when she was busy doing other things. As a result, she would sometimes pre -dispense morning doses in the previous evening (especially during the weekends) or only push the button to stop the alarm without taking her medication. She continued to use the e -MMA after study completion and was still using it at press t ime of this report ( Jan. 201 7). Albert was initially unsatisfied with the situation in his therapeutic living community where medications were handed out by caregivers. He felt patronized and described the e -MMA as a relief that allowed him to be more independent, both with his medication and his daily life. He mentioned the better hygiene of th e dispenser and that its presence reminded him to take the medications that he would normally take irregularly (e.g., medications for heart condition). The e -MMA worked reliably and gave him a predictable security. Ultimately, he was able to move out of the therapeutic living community and to live independently. Later, he acknowledged that he was addicted to Methylphenidate and that the e- MMA helped him to organize his weekly dose. Although it would not prevent him from overconsumption if he wanted to use m ore (e.g., from other sources), the e -MMA guaranteed that he would not run out of medication when he could not control himself. Drawbacks for him were the inflexibility of the system, especially for short -term holidays. On the one hand, he would have prefe rred a solution without the dispenser, e.g., weekly take -home doses. On the other hand, he did not like to carry large quantities of medication from the OAS and appreciated that with the new supply model he had his medications at home. He continued to use the e -MMA after study completion but discontinued when he was able to get weekly take- home doses. Denise was initially skeptical and felt like a \"guinea pig\" for participating in the study. However, she expected the e- MMA to disburden her from preparing he r medication in advance and assure regular intake. Additionally, she expected less medication boxes lying around. She was satisfied with the pre- packaged pouches but only for her HIV medications. She preferred to take the other medications (e.g., thyroid h ormones) from the original container because she felt that repackaging produced unnecessary plastic waste. She Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 143 remained ambivalent during the whole study period: on the one hand, she described a loss of control with the dispenser because she felt that medi cation management was one of the only things where she could still be in control. On the other hand, she repeatedly stressed that the pre-packed medications in the e -MMA were helpful because they were well organized and ready to take. Ultimately, she did n ot want to continue using the dispenser after study completion. Discussion Interpretation The assessment of adherence with an e -MMA showed high taking adherence but low timing adherence for 5 participants in our single -subject study. Additionally, the time variability (tVar) was high with an average of 1.5 hours. Participants with low self- reported adherence at baseline (i.e. Carmen and Brunhilde) were the only participants using the audible and visual reminders of the e- MMA. Remarkably, taking adherence in creased by more than 25% to almost 100% for both participants when reminders were introduced during the intervention phase. These results are consistent with current evidence for the effectiveness of electronic reminders on adherence 65. The built -in reminders of the e -MMA reduced missed doses to zero, compared to 15% missed doses with external reminders used by Denise. To stop the built -in reminder, patients have to retrieve their medication from the e -MMA. In contrast, external reminders , such as mobile phone alarms , can be switched off without having to approach the e -MMA. Of course, retrieval of pouches does not imply ingestion of medication. However, other studies have suggested that proximity of reminders to an action such as medication intake increase s the completio n of said action241. The high time variability can be explained by the number of intake times and the high rate of pre-dispensed doses. A higher number of intake times may increase time variability when multiple doses are retrieved at the same time, for example when pre- dispensing pocket doses. Several other reasons might explain the high rate of pre -dispenses in this study: First, we instructed participants to autonomously dispense medications to measure baseline adherence, bypassing the e- MMA's reminder function. As a re sult, patients might have formed a habit of pre- dispensing their pouches, even when audible and visual reminders were activated. The number of p re-dispenses dropped after the start of reminders for Carmen and Brunhilde, but increased again for both patient s during the intervention phase. Two previous case reports with the e -MMA showed over 90% timing adherence with almost no pre-Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 144 dispenses when audible and visual alerts were present from the beginning94. Second, we included medication in the pouches that did not ne cessarily need to be taken at fixed intervals, but were dosed on demand ( e.g., diazepam). Although we repackaged the full daily dose of these medications in one pouch, this might have encouraged participants to pre - dispense pouches containing their on -dema nd medications and thus increase time variability. Finally, substance ab use might have been an issue for some medications repackaged into pouches ( e.g., methylphenidate, benzodiazepines), encouraging patients to pre- dispense their daily doses. Arguably, t he importance of timely dosing depends on the respective therapy. Due to differences in pharmacologic properties, it is more important for some medications to be taken at exact times than for others. The probability of therapeutic success under imperfect adherence compared to perfect adherence has previously been described as \"forgiveness\" of medications 242. A typical example for unforgiving medications are treatments for infectious diseases, such as HIV. In our study, Denise was treated for HIV infection and thus, the low time var iability of less than one hour appears critical to ensure effective treatment. In contrast, Carmen's therapy consisted of supplements for malnutrition and psychoactive substances, which are considered more forgiving. Although her time variability was subst antially larger than Denise's, her adherence patterns may be appropriate for her specific therapy. Thus, the specificities of a patient's treatment ( e.g., forgiveness, presence of on - demand medications) should always be considered when assessing adherence to polypharmacy. Although not a focus of this study, we included clinical outcomes when routinely assessed and available during the study period. Overall, we observed marginal improvements or stagnancy, indicating that our intervention did not negatively affect treatments. Obviously, the e -MMA might offer the largest benefits to patients with low adherence and unmet clinical outcomes. However, consideration of humanistic outcomes might be more appropriate in multi -morbid patients with polypharmacy. Physica l and Mental quality of life (QoL) were low in our study, and participants showed high levels of psychological distress. QoL is affected by a range of concepts, such as physical health, psychological state, level of independence, social relationships, and their relationship to salient features of their environment 243. QoL is reportedly lower than average in patients with substance- use disorders, and improvements in QoL should be a priority for these patients244. Our results indicate trends towards the improvement of mental QoL, which might be explained by the additional attention participants received during the study. Additionally, IADL indicated a high independence of Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL ): A mixed -methods single -subject study 145 participants that could be sustained or increased with the e -MMA. Participants also reported independence and security of med ication availability as biggest advantages of the e- MMA. Most importantly, the e -MMA did not interfere with the care they received from the OAS. Strengths and l imitations Our study has several strengths. First, the use of single -case methodology allows for flexibility in the implementation of the intervention245. Second, adherence is a complex behavior that needs to be approached on an individual level. As such, single- case research designs might be more appropriate for the first -time assessment of interventions to improve adherence on the patient level compared to group -based randomized controlled trials. Third, a mixed -methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative methodology offers a more complete picture and allows to put the quantitative observations into context. We ac knowledge some limitations. First, we present a first -time analysis of adherence data from a novel e -MMA in a single -subject study. The design of the e -MMA with the sequential dispensing of doses might limit the interpretability of the chosen measures. The sequential design of the medication pouches required dispensing of every dose before the next dosing time. In case of multiple dosing times that sometimes were only two hours apart, we needed sufficient time to intervene in case of a missed dose. While di sadvantageous for the unconfounded measurement of adherence, this design ensures the timely implementation of complex regimens in practice. Especially in case of multiple intake times per day, other methods for monitoring adherence to polypharmacy might be more appropriate. For example, the \" POlymedication Electronic Monitoring System \" (POEMS; Confr\u00e9rie Clinique S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) uses printed electronics affixed to a multi -compartment blister pack to measure adherence with polypharmacy and monito rs each dose independently 37. Second, the results obtained from questionnaires might be confounded due to a social - desirability bias246. This might contribute to the relatively high self -reported adherence and the high satisfaction with the e -MMA, because the intervention was delivered by the sam e person that handed out the questionnaires. However, SF -12 and SCL -90R questionnaires were not directly linked to the intervention and we did not observ e any answer tendencies. Social desirability bias could be accounted for with the use of social desirab ility scales247. Third, we did not use randomization. In single -subject research designs, the order of baseline and intervention phase or starting points for each phase can be randomized248. With our small pilot study, we did not reach sufficient power for meaningful randomization. Further studies with more patients might benefit from a randomized design to increase internal Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 146 validi ty. Forth, we did not use statistical analyses for the interpretation of our results. Statistical analyses can sometimes assist in interpreting the results of single -subject studies, but cannot be used to generalize the results for other patients. Currently, no standards for statistical analysis of single -subject research exist240. The development of statistical methods to assess adherence in single- subject research might offer advantages for future research. Finally, our study was not designed to show improvement s in clinical, humanistic, or economic outcomes. Ultimately, the goal of adherence interventions should be to improve clinical and humanistic outcomes and increase cost -effectiveness of treatments 249. Applicability Our results suggest that the evaluated e -MMA ensures high taking adherence in opioid - substituted patients with polypharmacy. Furthermore, the audible and visual alerts might improve taking and timing adherence, but do not reduce time variability. Clinical and humanistic outcomes did not show conclusive changes during the study period. Future research should aim at evaluating the effect of the e -MMA on clinical and humanistic outcomes for sel ected patients. Our results suggest that the use of the e -MMA might be applicable for patients with: High perceived necessity of treatment Self-reported non -adherence Unforgiving treatments Low social support Psychologic distress However, other alternatives should be considered for: On-demand treatments Problematic substance use These findings add to the results of two case reports of opioid -substituted patients with HIV using the e -MMA for 1.7 and 2.5 years, respectively 94. In both cases, patients demonstrated continuous persistence with treatment, timing adherence of more than 90%, and suppressed HIV viral load with the e -MMA. Although single -case studies cannot provide evidence on the population level, successful replication of single -subject studies may provide a strong indication of generalizability 250. It has been suggested that at least five methodologically strong research reports from at least Project C4 | Adherence to Polypharmacy in Patients with Opioid Substitution Therapy using ELectronics (APPOSTEL): A mixed -methods single -subject study 147 three different research teams at three different settings with a total of at least 20 cases may provide sufficient evidence for clinical recommendations251. Conclusions The use of a mixed -method single -subject design showed promising results for the evaluation of an e -MMA for polypharmacy . Our pilot study showed that the e-MMA may ensure correct implementation of dosing regimens for opioid -substituted patients with polypharmacy when certain prerequisites are considered. Various drawbacks limit the applicability of the device to monitor adherence. A careful assessment of patient's barriers to medication adherence and a structured medication review should be the first steps when considering the use of the e - MMA for a patient. Overall, the flexibility of single- subjec t research designs offers considerable advantages for the evaluation of adherence interventions.

Alternative supply models to assist these patients with their medication management and support medication adherence are needed. Higher adherence has been associated with reduced overall healthcare costs and reduced hospitalization risk. However, evidence about cost -effectiveness of adherence- enhancing interventions is sparse. Electronic medication management systems might offer a benefit to older drug users receiving polypharmacy. We aimed to a) perform a cost -of-illness (COI) evaluation of patients receiving OAT and polypharmacy and to b) compare a novel electronic medication supply model to usual care. Methods: We estimated COI from a societal perspective for eligible patients of an outpatient addiction service (OAS) during one year. Direct medical costs for each patient were obtained from health insurance records for the year 2014. Direct non -medical and indirect costs were estimated based on a survey of patients' caregivers. For the cost -comparison model, we calcula ted the mean costs for the novel supply model, estimated changes in direct medical costs based on available literature, and compared costs to usual care. A sensitivity analysis was performed based on the variability of cost items for the novel supply model. Results: We included 29 patients (mean age of 47 \u00b1 6.3 years, 6 \u00b1 2 medications, 48.3% female) and health insurance records were available for 21 patients. None of the patients pursued a paid employment and 86% received disability benefits. Total yearly cost per patient was 109'611 Swiss Francs (SFr), with direct costs accounting for 30% of the total costs. With the novel supply model, total yearly costs per patient increased by SFr 2'509 for repackaging of medication, leasing of the dispenser, and time s pent for travel, refill, and support (+ 2.2% compared to base case). Sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust and overall costs did not substantially change with various estimations. Conclusion: Cost -of-illness for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy is high, especially when considering indirect costs, such as productivity loss due to disability. A novel electronic medication supply model increases overall costs marginally, but might offset the costs of more expensive alternatives , such as nursing homes. Further studies should evaluate the long -term benefits and cost -effectiveness of the novel supply model. Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 151 Introduction Healthcare costs are rising worldwide. A major driver of this development is the demographic shift to an older multi -morbid population. Globally, mental and substance use disorders were the leading cause of years lived with disability in 2010252. Up to 50% of opioid -dependent patients suffer from one or more psychiatric comorbidities253. Illicit drug users have higher rates of emergency medical visits and hospitalization than other high risk groups254, 255. In 2002, hospitalization costs of opioid -dependent patients in the United States (US) were US$ 13'393 in a two -year peri od, 2.5 times higher than those of average patients256. Alongside the trend in the general population, the age of patients with o pioid -assisted therapy (OA T) is also increasing183- 185. The concomitant increase in multi- morbidity leads to an even higher potential for negative health outcomes for patients with OAT . Older drug users are likely to suffer f rom the accumulated physical and mental health effects of polysubstance use, overdoses and infections257. On the one hand, drug use causes premature ageing of the body258, 259. On the other hand, effective therapies extend lives. Consequently, older drug users become prone to conditions that normally occur with greater frequency among much older people, such as alcohol- and tobacco -related illnesses, including diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, arthritis, cardiovascula r conditions, and chronic lung disease. In addition, older drug users may also be affected by progressive conditions that may take decades to cause significant illness or death: A study estimated that in 2010, 2.1% of opioid users were HIV - positive and 43% had chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection 260. Pharmacotherapy has become standard in the therapy of most chronic conditions. Consequently, many older and thus multi -morbid patients with OAT also take multiple chronic medications. In a sample of 154 opioid -substituted patients from an outpatient addiction service (OAS) in Basel, Switzerland, 58.4% used 3 or more active ingredients in 201393. Although many studies have shown clinical and economic benefits of pharmacotherapy when used consequently, adherence to medication is generally only around 75% and even lower with psychiatric illnesses38. Opioid -dependent patients are at high risk for non -adherence due to high prevalence of psychological problems, substance abuse, unemployment, low socioeconomic status, and low social support38,211, 215, 216, 261, 262. Low medication adherence has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. The world health organization estimated the annual cost of medication non -adherence at US$ 300 billion world -wide 19. Higher adherence has been associated with reduced overall healthcare costs and reduced hospitalization risk for diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and chronic heart failure223. Unfortunately, little evidence exists about Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 152 cost -effectiveness of adherence -enhancing interventions43,263, 264. Recently, electronic medication management aids (MMAs) emerged, reminding patients with acoustic or visual alerts to take their medication, dispensing the right medication at the right time, and tracking each event. A review of telemedicine and telecare for older patients found mostly positive results, especially for behavioral outcomes such as adherence265. Furthermore, the \"Safe at home\" project evaluated assistive technology to improve the independence of older patients and reported net savings of over \u00a3 1.5 million during 21 months for 233 service users compared with 173 non -users 266. Rationale Opioid -dependent pati ents pose a high burden on health -care expenditures, and the increasing age and complexity of this population will likely lead to additional costs. Alternative supply models to assist patients with their medication management and support medication adheren ce are needed for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy. Electronic medication dispensers might offer a benefit to older drug users receiving polypharmacy. First, a remote support assures independence of the patients. Second, real -time monitoring assure s high medication adherence without the need of too many visits to a dispensing point. A novel remote electronic medication supply model was feasible to maintain medication supply and assure correct implementation of dosing regimens of more than 90% for su ch patients. The sustained persistence and consistent implementation accomplished with this model may reduce healthcare costs and the savings might compensate for the additional costs of the novel model. Aims Our goal was to analyze the cost aspects of the medication supply for opioid -substituted patients. We aimed to: Perform a cost -of-illness evaluation of patients receiving OAT and polypharmacy (base case) establish a cost -comparison model for the novel supply model compared to standard medication supply (base case) Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 153 Methods Study design and s etting First, we performed a COI study for patients with OAT and polypharmacy from a societal perspective (base case). We considered tangible costs using a prevalence- based approach and estimated direct and indirect c osts during one year. Second, we generated a cost -comparison model for the novel supply model versus the base case. The setting was the outpatient addiction service (OAS) of the Psychiatric University Hospital in Basel, Switzerland. The OAS offers treatmen t to patients with substance use disorders, mental and somatic disorders, and social impairments and problems. Patients are treated by a multidisciplinary team consisting of professionals from the fields of medicine, nursing, social work and psychology. Up to 100 patients per day visit the public dispensing point of the OAS to obtain their medication in the traditional way. Patients take their (substitution) medication on site under supervision at least once per week and receive additional doses and medicat ions for take -home. Medications are either prepared in advance or immediately before dispensing. In some cases, the OAS prepares and delivers medications including OAT for patients living in supervised settings (Figure 36). With the novel supply model, patients receive OAT at the OAS once per week, while all other medications are supplied approximately three -weekly in unit -dose pouches with an automated electronic dispenser located at the patient's home. The dispenser is an electronic medication management system described elsewhere in detail 94. Briefly, it dispenses pre -packed medication according to a schedule and remotely monitors medication retrievals. Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for o lder patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 154 Figure 36: The three possibilities of the medication process at the OAS Target population Patients were included in a two -step process. First, all patients of the OAS were screened in a pseudonymized database for the number of medications. Patients receiving more than 3 medications per day were identified and includ ed based on the following criteria: reading and writing literacy in German stable housing situation in canton Basel -Stadt and adjoining municipality polymedication (treatment with more than 3 drugs per day) insured with a Swiss health insurance provided signed written consent Measures Direct medical costs (Swiss Francs, SFr) were obtained for each patient from health insurance records for the year 2014. We differentiated between hospital costs, psychiatric treatments (including OAT and other medications d ispensed in the OAS), other medical services, pharmacy costs, laboratory tests, and home care. Costs for repackaging of medication for the novel supply model were derived from the collective remuneration agreement between the Patient collects medication at OAS Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 155 Swiss pharmacist association a nd health insurers (tariff \"Wochendosiersystem\", LOA IV). For direct non -medical costs of the traditional medication supply, we measured the time (minutes) necessary for dispensing medications in the OAS. Time spent between patients advancing to the counte r and their departure was measured with a stopwatch during one day for each counter. Dispensing of prepared medication or interruptions , such as alcohol breath tests , were noted for each measurement. Medication preparation time for patients receiving pre-prepared medications was measured during four different days. Direct non -medical costs for the novel supply model were estimated by measuring time spent for travel and refills (two patients), as well as support (four patients) between November 2013 and Apri l 2015. Time -units were converted to monetary costs using hourly wages of health -care professionals with no management function according to the Swiss federal statistical office for 2012 267. Costs of the dispenser were based on an annual fee paid to the supplier (Innospense BV, The Netherlands). A questionnaire that was distributed to caregivers captured information about individual patients in order to calculate direct non -medical costs and indirect costs. We questioned the caregivers and not patients to avoid social desirability bias. We contacted patients in case of missing information. Layout , comprehensibility, and completeness of the questionnaire were assessed in a pilot with 4 PhD students of the Pharmaceutical Care Research Group, 2 Master students, and 2 caregivers from the OAS. The final questionnaire included 5 questions and took 5 min utes to answer. Questions 1 -4 covered direct non -medical costs (frequency of visits to the OAS per week, preparation of medications in advance, travel time from patient's home to OAS and means of travel, and support with medication management at home) and question 5 covered indirect costs (profession, employment, working ability, social benefits). Together with the questionnaire, caregivers were asked to provide medication lists and diagnoses for each patient to verify the inclusion criteria. Indirect costs included productivity losses (human capital method) and disability/social benefits in Swiss Francs. Gross monthly wages were obtained from the Swiss federal statistical office for 2012 267, 268. Information about disability benefits and extraordinary benefits were obtained from an information sheet of the service point of the old age, disabled and survivors' social security system in collaboration with the Federal office for social insurance 269. Information about social benefits was obtained from the Swiss conference for social benefits (SKOS)270. Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 156 Analysis Data were analyzed with SPSS\u00ae Version 22 (Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, IBM, Armonk, Ne w York - USA). We calculated means and medians, minimum, maximum, and standard deviations for descriptive variables. We applied Mann -Whitney U -Test and chi- square tests for comparisons of two independent groups and Spearman tests for correlations. A p-valu e < 0.05 was considered significant. For the cost -comparison model, we calculated the mean costs for the novel supply model and performed a sensitivity analysis by adding and subtracting one standard deviation from individual cost items (i.e., travel, refi ll, and support). We assumed that costs for some elements of direct medical costs (i.e., hospital costs, other medical treatments, and laboratory tests) would decrease, while costs for pharmacy -dispensed medications would increase. We excluded psychiatric treatments from this assumption, because these included OAT , which would not change with the novel supply model. A study assessing the association between medication adherence and healthcare costs estimated a gross reduction of medical costs by 20% and an increase of medication costs by 45% for perfect adherence versus various levels of non -adherence 223. We therefore calculated our cost -comparison mod el with these estimations and assumed that indirect costs remained unchanged with the novel supply model. Funding and a pprovals The study was funded by the University of Basel and has been approved by the Ethics Committee of n orthwestern Switzerland [EKNZ: 2014 -071]. Results Participants The screening identified 78 patients (32% female) receiving more than 3 medications. They had a mean age of 45 \u00b1 7.6 years and received on average 5 \u00b1 2 medications (min = 3, max = 13) from the OAS. Of 40 patients contacted for inclusion, 29 agreed to participate and 11 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Direct and indirect cost of illness We received 21 cost accountings from health insurances that we included for analysis. The questionnaire was answered for 29 patients (mean age of 47 \u00b1 6.3 years, 6 \u00b1 2 medications, Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 157 48.3% female) . Most patients (80%) visited the OAS once per week and 83% collected their medications without previous preparation ( Table 17). None of the patients received any kind of support with their medications at home. Approximately one third of the patients (31%) did not have a professional qualification and none of the patients pursued a paid emplo yment. A large majority (90%) was incapable of working and thus 86% received disability benefits. For the traditional medication supply, we measured 35 dispensing events at both counters. The average time spent per patient without pre- prepared medication was 4 minutes and did not differ between counters (p > 0.5). Pre -preparation of medications measured in 14 instances took 10.3 minutes per patient per one -week supply. Cost of illness The base -case COI was 109'564 SFr per year per patient (n=21, Table 18). The biggest share of the total costs were related to the indirect costs (70%). Direct non -medical costs (homecare and traditional medication supply at the OAS accounted for 1.3% of total costs. Most of the patients (n=9) had a COI between 100'000 SFr and 115'000 SFr, while 5 patients SFr. The highest COI was 194'655.60 SFr ( Figure 37). Costs were not significantly associated with age, sex, number of medications, frequency of visits to the OAS per week, preparation of medications in advance, travel time from patient's home to OAS and means of travel, or support with medication management at home (p > 0.05).

Support was provided to four patients in a total of 82 instances and took on average 6 minutes per patient per instance. Notably, one patient was responsible for 64.6% of all support cases. The majority of issues could be resolved remotely (76.8 %). With an hourly wage of SFr 34.50, the novel supply model was approximately 12 times more expensive than dispensing of medication at the OAS counter ( Table 19: Direct non -medical costs for medication supply ).

This accounted for 2.2% and 7.1% of the total costs and direct costs of the base case, resp ectively. With the novel supply model and an estimated reduction of direct medical costs by 20% (except psychiatric treatments and pharmacy costs) and an increase of pharmacy costs by 45%, the costs per year increased by SFr 328.52 (+ 0.3% compared to base case, Table 20 ). Sensitivity analysis showed that costs did not substantially change with various estimations (Models B and C).

We found a high total costs, with over SFr 109'000 per patient per year. Direct medical costs amounted to almost 30% of all costs, half of which accrued for psychiatric treatment and a third during hospital admissions. OAT likely represe nts a significant portion of the psychiatric treatment costs, as it was provided by the psychiatric clinic. Also, the OAS dispenses additional medications to some patients which were included in the psychiatric treatments as well. As a result, pharmacy cos ts were comparably low, accounting for only 0.8% of the total costs. Hospital costs were more than twice as high as those reported for opioid users in the US in 2002 256. Apart from an overall increase of costs between 2002 and 2014 and differences in healthcare systems between the US and Switzerland, the additio nal costs could be associated with the increased age of the opioid -substituted population. Between 2002 and 2013, the mean age of patients with OAT in the OAS increased from 37 to 45 years93. Although we were not able to show a correlation between age and costs in our Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 161 sample, health care costs generally increase with greater age271. Homecare costs only amounted to roughly 1% of total costs. Apparently, patients with OAT are independent, as previously shown in a single -subject study with 5 patients95. None of the patients received support with their medications at home. The question remains, whether some of the patients would benefit from added support. Most patients visit the OAS only once a week, which is the minimum legal requirement in Switzerland. This mi ght be explained by the seniority of the patients who are generally in treatment for many years and do not require more frequent supervision of medication intake. Still, 20% of our sample required two or more visits per week. The need to attend all appoint ments and the supervised consumption poses a barrier to OAT for most patients 202. On one hand, data from the US indicates that extended take- home periods may improve outco mes and retention in care203, 204. A novel medication supply model with an electronic dispenser might assist to extend take -home periods for up to 4 weeks. On the other hand, frequent contacts are important to OAT providers202. Medications were most often dispensed without preparation in advance, which resulted in very little costs generated by medication dispensing in the OAS. However, the increasing polypharmacy and complexity of treatments could add more stress to caregivers with the potential of dispensing errors272. Indirect costs due to productivity loss and disability benefits amounted to almost 70% of total costs. In our sample, the unemployment rate was 100%, although two -thirds had secondary education . As a result, travel costs for patients to visit the OAS were irrelevant for our cost analysis. We estimated the annual costs for the novel supply model at roughly SFr 2'500 for repackaging of medication, leasing of the dispenser, refill every 3 weeks, t echnical support, and OAS visits once weekly. This accounted for 2.3% of total costs, with repackaging into unit -dose pouches and leasing for the dispenser being the main cost items. The remuneration for the weekly repackaging of polypharmacy in Switzerlan d is paid for by health insurances when patients receive three or more medications ( OAT not included). Compared to the fragmented dispensing provided by the OAS, unit -dose pouches offer various benefits: Patients receive medications for every intake time i n a sealed pouch labelled with the date and time of intake. The repackaging process is subject to strict quality controls and the identity of the contents is guaranteed. This reduces the potential for erroneous dispensing almost to zero. Our estimated pric e for dispenser leasing is based on the prices set by the distributor. At the time of our study, this dispenser was not routinely available in Switzerland. Hence, the actual market price for the device might differ from our estimation should it become available in Switzerland. Additional service costs have to be considered. We Project C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 162 assumed that the dispenser would be refilled by caregivers at patients' homes every three weeks. The travel time to patients for refill events accounted for the highest share of servi ce costs. With the novel supply model, an average duration of 30 minutes for travel equated to the mean time required for the majority of patients to visit the OAS. Higher patient numbers would reduce time spent per patient and reduce costs of the novel su pply model. Embedding the service into existing home care services might be a valuable option. Another possibility for stable and reliable patients would be to collect the refill medications at the OAS during a routine visit and refill the dispenser themse lves. Our cost -comparison model showed that the novel medication model might be almost cost - neutral. We assumed no change of psychiatric treatments and indirect costs with the novel supply model. However, these are the major cost items for these patients and a success of the novel supply model may result in a reduction of these costs. For example, increased independence might enable patients to pursue paid employment. Furthermore, other alternatives to the traditional supply model, such as assisted living o r nursing homes, would be much more expensive. Limitations We acknowledge some limitations. First, we studied only a small population from a local setting. Our sample size was too limited to show significant correlations between co sts and patient characteristics such as number of medications or age. Although the comparison with a more representative sample of Swiss opioid -substituted patients showed a similar age and gender distribution as our sample, we cannot guarantee the applicability of our re sults to other settings. For example, the abovementioned survey showed an unemployment rate of roughly 50% in 2012 202, compared to 100% unemployment in our sample. Consequ ently, COI for the whole population of opioid -substituted patients in Switzerland will be lower than what we report for multi -morbid patients with polypharmacy. Second, we did not consider costs of premature deaths. On one hand, the primary purpose of the novel supply model is not to reduce mortality, but to increase independence of patients with suboptimal medication adherence. Thus, costs of premature deaths were not of immediate interest to our study. On the other hand, patients with stable OAT suffer fr om a multitude of different diseases. As a result, we were not able to generalize costs of premature deaths. Third, we did not calculate the total burden of disease at a population level and we only considered a time horizon of one year. Although the cumul ative costs of patients with OAT and polypharmacy might be of interest, our aim was to gauge the financial consequences of a novel medication supply model Projec t C5 | Economic aspects of medication supply for older patients with opioid substitution therapy and polypharmacy 163 on an individual level. Finally, we were not able to use actual effectiveness data of the novel suppl y model. No studies exist that provide data about effects on adherence or costs for this intervention. We estimated costs based on a few select cases where the novel supply model was tested with patients from the target population. Our assumptions regardin g effects on costs were based on data from the US that stem from different settings and a different healthcare system. However, our sensitivity analysis showed that costs with the novel supply changed marginally with a range of possible estimations. Conclusion COI for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy is high, especially when considering indirect costs, such as productivity loss due to disability. A novel electronic medication supply model increases overall costs marginally, but might offset the cost s of more expensive alternatives , such as nursing homes. Further studies should evaluate the long -term benefits and cost -effectiveness of the novel supply model.

Tailored approaches that match interventions and patient determinants of non- adherence were seldom used in clinical trials. The presence of a multitude of theoretical frameworks and models to categorize interventions and patient d eterminants complicated the development of common categories shared by interventions and determinants. We retrieved potential interventions and patient determinants from published literature on medication adherence, matched them like locks and keys, and categorized them according to the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Methods: We identified the most relevant literature reviews on interventions and determinants in a pragmatic literature search, extracted all interventions and determinants, grouped similar concepts to umbrella terms and assigned them to TDF categories. All steps were finalized in consensus discussion between the authors. Results: Sixteen articles (5 with determinants, 11 with interventions) were included for analysis. We extracted 10 3 interventions and 42 determinants that we divided in 26 modifiable and 16 unmodifiable determinants. All interventions and modifiable determinants were matched within 11 categories (Knowledge; Skills; Social/professional and identity; Beliefs about capabilities; Beliefs about consequences; Intentions; Memory, Attention and decision processes; Environmental context and resources; Social influences; Emotion; and Behavioral regulation). Conclusion: In published trials on medication adherence, the congru ence between interventions and determinants can be assessed with matching interventions to determinants. To be successful, interventions in medication adherence should target current modifiable determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable determinants. Modifiable and unmodifiable determinants need to be assessed at inclusion of intervention studies to identify the patients most in need of an adherence intervention. Our matched categories may be useful to develop interventions in trials that investigate the effectiveness of adherence interventions. Project D1 | Matching adherence in terventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 169 Introduction After 4 decades of research on adherence to medication, the progress is disappointing and adherence remains a fragmented construct. Medication adherence is briefly defined as the behavioral response to an agreed medical recommendation 19 and is measured either dichotomously (either one is adherent, or one is not) or continuously. Recently, medication adherence has been defined to consist of three different components : initiation, implementation, and discontinuation208. Non -adherence is not simply the reverse of adherence. Two patients can be equally non -adherent with respect to measuring adherence, for example take only 60 % of their pills. At the same time, the reasons for these pati ents to be non- adherent may vary widely. The complexity of the characteristics of adherence was already known by the end of the 1970s18. Despite much research in the 1980s and 1990s, few new insights arose. Research in the 1990s emphasized the influence of patient beliefs about health in general and about illness/medication in particular46. Qualitative research on patients' perspectives started with the new millennium and identified new issues like the quality of the doctor -patient relation ship and patient health beliefs47. Grossly, five theoretical approaches could be identified that all view non -adheren ce from a different perspective48. The oldest approach is the biomedical model that focuses on dispositional characteristics of the patient , such as demographic or personality traits. Operant behavior and social learning theories shifted the focus to the behaviors needed for adherence. In t he communication model, the patient seeks expert advice and treatment from the healthcare professional; adherence results from persuasion through effective communication. The rational decision -health belief and reasoned action model generated the patient's perception of risk and motivation for action. Finally, the self -regulative systems theory sees the patients as an active problem solver. Extent and factors of non -adherence have been extensively investigated, and a plethora of strategies to improve adherence was developed, mo stly without consistent success57. A systematic review of reviews analyzed interventions with regard to theoretical models and found no clear correlation between the effectivenes s of interventions that were theory -based and those without an explicit theoretical background58. The most recent approach, the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), was developed to integrate the various behavior change theories. It aimed to simplify the investigation of behavio rs such as adherence a nd to facilitate intervention design 60. Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 170 Success in a complex process like adherence can only be achieved with the integration of many ingredients, and a single obstruction cause s failure. This concept is sometimes referred to as the \"Anna Karenina principle\", referring to the first sentence in Tolstoy's novel Anna Karenina: \"Happy families are all alike. Every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.\" In this regard, it takes on e deficient factor to cause non -adherence. Therefore, the purpose of any intervention strategy should be to compensate for each reason causing non -adher ence. As acknowledged by others 273- 275, it seems thus obvious that a tailored approach is required, i.e. an approach that adapts the intervention to individual needs, i.e. that adapts the keys (interventions) to the locks (patient determinants). Various attempts to categorize interventions ended up with coarse sections like educational, behavioral, social, and mixed forms 276 or simple groupings59. In the field of behavior change research , a recent international consensus developed a framework (the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy) with 93 behavior change te chniques clustered in 16 groups162. Although not specific for medication adherence, the new taxonomy has been used to classify interventions in the field of adherence research277. As behavior change is only one aspect of medication adherence, this unilateral framework appears limited to cat egorize the sum of all adherence interventions. A broader view on adherence was captured by a Cochrane Review on interventions to improve s afe and effective medicines use278. Interventions were grouped in 8 categories: Providing information or education; Facilitating communication and/or decision making; Acquiring skil ls and competencies; Supporting behavior change; Support; Minimizing risks or harms; Improving quality, and Consumer system participation. Patient determinants of non -adherence were often categorized according to the five dimensions o f non -adherence proposed by WHO19 or variations of these concep ts279: Social - and economic -related factors; Health system/health team -related factors; Therapy factors; Condition -related factor s, and Patie nt-related factors. Matching possible targets for medication adherence to the types of interventions will yield more insight in effective strategies able to overcome the different barriers for medication adherence. To our knowledge, common categories shared by interventions and patient determinants of non- adherence have never been proposed. As a result, interventions for improving adherence and patient determinants were seldom matched in clinical trials. As an example, from 109 studies aimed at improving patient adherence, only 13% reported the assessment of patient determinants at baseline 225. Even though some studies reported tailoring of interventions to patient characteristics, the specific procedure remains often unclear and thus, the results are almost impossible to replicate 225. Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants us ing the Theoretical Domains Framework 171 In this article, we retrieved potential interventions and patient determinants from published literature on me dication adherence and aimed at matching them like locks and keys. Goals/Aims To extract from literature salient a) interventions intended to improve adherence and b) related patient determinants of non -adherence To categorize the retrieved a) intervention s and b) determinants To match a) and b) Methodology Search strategy Several recent systematic literature reviews exist on interventions and patient determinants of non -adherence. It seemed superfluous to repeat this process and thus, we abstained from a systematic literature search with broad major/MeSH terms , such as \"patient compliance\". Rather and in order to identify literature with the highest relevance to our aims, we pursued a pragmatic search strategy to identify existing reviews with the terms \"intervention\" and \"determinant\" or \"factor\" which are widely used in conjunction with medication adherence. We combined these specific terms with the established terms \"adherence\" or \"compl iance\". We searched Medline via Pubmed on March 10, 2015 (without t ime limits) with the following terms and a limit set to reviews: a) intervention*[title] AND (improv*[title] OR enhanc*[title]) AND medication[title] AND (adherence[title] OR compliance[title]) Titles and abstracts of the search results were screened for relevance by two investigators (SA, IA). To assure a generic view on medication adherenc e (not restricted to specific diseases, medications or settings), we excluded full -text articles when they investigated: single conditions single medication groups specific providers specific target groups single intervention economic evaluations specific adherence measurement methods Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 172 Data extraction and processing All extractions were performed in MAXQDA 11 (VERBI GmbH, Berlin, Germany). All steps were performed separately for interventions and determinants. In the first step, IA and SA reviewed full- texts from the included articles. Both investigators independently extracted items of a) interventions and b) determinants for non- adherence and scanned the reference list for additional articles. Investigators were not blinded with regard to authors or journa l. The lists were reviewed by both investigators in a consensus discussion and umbrella terms were introduced for items with similar connotations. In the second step, IA and SA independently matched each intervention to individual determinants. Items that did not match were listed separately. In the third step, IA and SA assigned the matched interventions and determinants to the 14 domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). We chose the TDF because it offers the most recent framework, combines va rious theoretical models, and has a strong empirical base. We determined consistency among raters performing an interrater reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic. Disagreements were resolved by discussion until consensus was reached (first and sec ond steps) or by an adjudicator (third step). Results Literature Search A total of 65 articles were obtained ( Figure 38). Two articles were updated versions of previou s Cochrane analyses280, 281. Screening of the reference lists yielded two additional articles t hat were included in the review47,278. Five articles were excluded after screening of titles and abstracts because they were not relevant to our aims. After full -text screening, 44 articles were excluded because they investigated (a) single condit ions (18; schizophrenia, psychiatric disorder, transplantation, diabetes, hypertension, Parkinson, inflammatory bowel, rosacea); (b) single medication groups (14; antidepressant, cardiovascular, heart failure, antipsychotic, osteoporosis, hypoglycemic and lipid lowering agents); (c) specific providers (4; pharmacist, physician, nurse); (d) specific target groups (1; children); (e) single intervention (4; HIT, technology- mediated, cultural responsive, electronic reminders); (f) economic evaluations (2); (g) adherence measurement methods (1; electronically compiled drug dosing history). Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 173 The final set included 16 articles (11 with interventions, 5 with determinants, Table 21). Figure 38: PRISMA flow diagram (22) for study selection process We extracted 103 different interventions, including variations of the same concept , such as different forms of reminders. We extracted 42 determinants that we divided into 26 modifiable and 16 unmodifiable determinants. We defined modifiable determinants as factors that may be changed by interventions (such as knowledge or behaviors) and unmodifiable determinants as those that are unchangeable (such as age). Some unmodifiable determinants may appear modifiable at first sight, such as level of education or employment situation. However, those determinants are not targeted by the adherence interventions, albeit they may influence the choice of an appropriate intervention. Thus, unmodifiable determinants ( Box 6) were not included in the m atching procedure.

Because heterogeneous interventions and determinants were included in the domain \"Environmental context and resources\", we created the subdomains ( Table 23). The interrater reliability was substantial with a Cohen's Kappa of 0.7 (95% CI 0.5 - 0.9, p < 0.001).

The fact that interventions were more diverse than patient determinants is not surprising, as there is usually more than one way to target a single determinant. In a previous review on patient determinants, the authors grouped similar contents together and ended up with 40 heterogeneous umbrella terms 49. What appears nearly identical to our 42 patient determinants is slightly different, since no overlap existed with our determinants for 6 of the 40 umbrella terms (\"Socia l stigma of patient determinants must be considered unmodifiable, such as age, gender, or culture. In our view, this distinction is essential for the choice of adherence interventions. In order to be effective, we postulate that interventions have on one hand to target current modifiable patient determinants and on the other hand to be tailored to the unmodifiable patient determinants. This lack of distinction among the patient determinants in previous literature may explain partly why no meta -analysis could demonstrate an overall benefit of interventio ns aimed at enhancing adherence 290. Further research is needed to investigate if adherence is improved when the intervention is matched to the patient determinants for non -adherence according to our matching list. The importance of tailoring interventions to patien t characteristics h as been acknowledged previously273- 275. To our knowledge, no published framework aimed to match interventions and patient determinants of non -adherence. Specific toolboxes for tailored interventions cover a restricted number of interv entions or patient determinants291, 292. Their intended use is the application in daily practice where a workable toolbox t rumps a comprehensive framework. The 5 WHO dimensions that could be used to classify both interventions and patient determinants are too coarse to provide meaningful guidance 19. The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) has been the most recent and complete effort to develop theory - informed behavior change intervent ions293 or assess the underlying theoreti cal constructs of interventions294. Because it was not specifically developed for interventions and patient determinants of non- adherence, some adaption was warranted. While we were able to assign all interventions and patient determinants to one of the domains, we did not use 3 of t he original 14 domains: \"Optimism\", \"Reinforcement\" and \"Goals\". Optimism (i.e. the confidence that things will happen for the best or that desired goals will be attained) may theoretically differ from beliefs, but we chose not to differentiate between the two concepts for practical Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 184 reasons. By definition, reinforcement (i.e. increasing the probability of a response by arranging a dependent relationship, or contingency, between the response and a given stimulus) can only apply to interventions. Hence, we were not able to use this domain for shared interventions and determinants. Instead, we assigned interventions belonging to the Reinforcement domain to \"Intentions\". Goals (i.e. mental representations of outcomes or end states that an individual wants to ach ieve) also overlaps with Intentions and we chose not to differ between the two concepts. Some of the extracted interventions did not target patient determinants. They represent much more unspecific interventions, such as general education to improve knowledge. In contrast, one extracted determinant (Prescribing errors) could not be matched to a specific intervention. Although it is obvious that studies to reduce prescribing errors were performed, they may not have been aimed at enhancing adherence to treat ment. Our matching list allows for the assessment of congruency between interventions and patient determinants in published trials. Under the prerequisite that a causal relationship exists between our interventions and corresponding patient determinants, our list may help to assess the quality of published studies and their results 220. Furthermore, our matching list may be useful to develop interventions and to plan trials to assess the effectiveness of interventions with respect to modifiable and unmodifiable patient determinants. We acknowledge some limitations. First, we applied a very specific search strategy to identify the most relevant literature. A systematic approach with broader search terms and additional databases might have yielded more articles, however, may not have yielded additional items of interventions or patient determinants. The 85% overlapping between our determinants and those retrieved from a system atic review of reviews 49 reinforces this assumption. Second, we did not consider the effectiveness of the interventions, the frequency of the patient determinants, nor the impact size of the patient determinants on adherence. Consequently, matching interventions to patient de terminants based on our results does not guarantee for a successful adherence intervention. Other concepts may be important to consider: determinants may be different for each component of medication adherence: initiation, implementation, and discontinuati on 49,208. The current literature lacks the informa tion about which determinant is associated to each of the three phases. Third, our final matching list was not externally validated. However and in line with others, the existence of approximatively 40 different determinants seems plausible. Project D1 | Matching adherence interventions to patient determinants using the Theoretical Domains Framework 185 Our study has some strengths. First, we based our selection on published models and theories, and previously proposed categories. Consequently, our matching list represents a robust framework in line with underlying theories. Second, reliability was given from 2 indepe ndent investigators for extraction and categorization reaching substantial agreement. Third, the exclusion of reviews with focus on specific diseases, populations or other criteria guarantees a broad applicability of the matching list. Conclusion Matched i nterventions and patient determinants in common categories are needed to assess the congruency between interventions and patient determinants in published trials on medication adherence. Our matching list may be useful to develop interventions in trials th at investigate the effectiveness of adherence interventions. Application of this list will show its practicability and may initiate its refinement and further development into a practical tool. To be successful, interventions in medication adherence should target current modifiable patient determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable patient determinants. Modifiable and unmodifiable determinants need to be assessed at inclusion of intervention studies to identify the patients most in need of an adherenc e intervention.

An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 188 Abstract Background : Due to the negative outcomes of medication non -adherence, interventions to improve adherence have been the focus of countless studies. In their latest update of a Cochrane review reporting inconsistent effects of adherence interventions, the authors offere d access to their database for sub -analysis. We aimed to use this database to assess congruence between adherence -related patient characteristics and interventions and its association with intervention effects. Methods : We developed a congruence score cons isting of 6 features related to inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline, and intervention design. Two independent raters extracted and scored items from the 190 studies available in the Cochrane database. We correlated overall congruence sc ore and individual features with intervention effects regarding adherence and clinical outcomes using Kruskal Wallis rank sum test and Fisher's exact test. Findings : Interrater -reliability for newly extracted data was almost perfect with a Cohen's Kappa of 0.92 (95% CI 0 .89 - 0.94, p < 0.001). The inclusion of non -adherent patients was the single feature significantly associated with effective adherence interventions (p = 0 .003). Moreover, effective adherence interventions were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes (p < 0 .0001). However, neither the overall congruence score, nor any other individual feature (i.e. \"determinants of non -adherence as inclusion criteria\", \"tailoring of interventions to the inclusion criteria\", \"reasons for non -adherence assessed at baseline\", \"adjustment of intervention to individual patient needs\", and \"theory based interventions\") were significantly associated with intervention effects. Interpretation : The presence of only six studies that included non -adheren t patients and the inter -dependency of this feature with the remaining five might preclude a conclusive assessment of congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions. In order to obtain clinical benefits from effective adherence inte rventions, we encourage researchers to select non -adherent patients, measure adherence -related patient characteristics at baseline, and match interventions to the study population. Funding : This study was funded by the University of Basel, Switzerland. Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 189 Introduction Medication adherence describes the behavior by which patients take their medications as prescribed, and is divided in the phases of initiation, implementation, and discontinuation295. Medication adherence was reported to average around 75% across various conditions an d settings38. Due to the negative outcomes of non -adherence , such as increased mo rbidity, mortality, and costs, the improvement of medication adherence has been a focus for the World Health Organization since 200319. Medication adherence is deter mined by a multitude of factors18,49,51,279, 282- 284. Various models had been pr oposed to explain non -adherence48. The most recent is the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), which integrated multiple behavior theories and provides a method to assess professional and other health -related behaviors. The Cochrane collaboration published a review of interventi ons to enhance a dherence and subsequent updates57,59,220. According to the latest update, interventions intended to enhance medication adherence show uncertain results and evidence of their effects remains low. A high risk of bias and heterogeneity in the measurement of adherence outcomes ( e.g., pill counts, self -report, pharmacy claims data, or electronic monitor ing) represent the main reasons 16. Other issues have been suggested that might impair study results, such as including patients regardless of their current adherence225, 273 or not assessing determinants of non -adherence at baseline. From 109 randomized controlled and unsurprisingly, interventions are often unsatisfactorily described and thus not reproducible. This limitation has been recognized and a checklist has been proposed to better report interventions in future studies296. Finally, most interventions do not ensue from theoretical mod els58 although interventions aimed at changing behavior have been shown to be more effective if based on theoretical models297. Only 39% of the 109 -abovementioned studies used theory -based interventions225. Although some interventions without theoretical background were found to be effective, such as technical in terventions ( e.g., the use of pillboxes), theoretical considerations are important to identify essential components of the interventions296. Using the TDF, a systematic approach to develop interventions based on theory and potential determinants has been proposed.293 Determinants of non -adherence cover patient characteristics and could also relate to other factors , such as the provider and health system19. In a precedent work based on a pragmatic literature review, we proposed to classify determinants of non -adherence as either modifiable (i.e. factors that may be changed by interventions , such as knowledge or behaviors) or unmodifiable (i.e. factors that are unchangeable, such as age)97. We juxtaposed Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and i nterventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 190 modifiable determinants of non -adherence with interventions aimed at improving medication adherence. In brief, we matched 26 modifiable determinants to 103 interventions within 11 common categories derived from the TDF (Knowledge; Skills; Social/professional role and identity; Beliefs about about consequences; Intentions; Memory, Attention and decision processes; Environmental context and resources; Social influences; Emotion; Behavioral regulation). An additional 16 determinants were regarded as unmodifiable. This approach may be useful to assess the congruence between patient characteristics and interventions in studies aimed to improve adherence. Why is it important to do this analysis? In their latest update, the authors of the abovementioned Cochrane review220 offered access to their database to facilitate sub -analyses of their data. We hypothesize that the congruence between adherence -related patient characteristics and interventions can partly explain the variab ility of effectiveness in medication adherence studies. To our knowledge, the congruence between interventions designed to enhance medication adherence and patient characteristics reported in clinical studies has not been investigated yet. Multiple feature s regarding inclusion criteria, baseline adherence assessment and intervention design may serve to determine the level of congruence between interventions and patient characteristics. First, assessing the level of non -adherence at inclusion is important t o select only non- adherent participants. Otherwise, the effects of the intervention will be diluted and the power of the trial to detect a significant effect will be diminished through the presence of adherent patients. Second, non -adherence is affected by a multitude of patient characteristics. When inclusion criteria are based on determinants of non -adherence, the chance of selecting non - adherent patients should increase. Thus, selecting patients based on modifiable determinants of non -adherence, together with matching the intervention to these determinants, should ensure that patients who are most likely to benefit from an intervention are included (for example selecting patients with poor knowledge about their treatment for an educational intervention). Third, assessing the reasons for non -adherence at baseline allows for adjustment of the intervention to patients' individual needs. This may increase the efficacy of the intervention. Finally, interventions designed according to theoretical models might be more effective. Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth an alysis of a Cochrane review 191 Objectives We aimed to analyze the contents of the Cochrane database220 with these objectives: To extract and code features regarding inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline, and intervention design, according to our juxtaposition list To calculate a congruence score between potential mod ifiable determinants and the intervention based on these features To correlate the congruence score with the reported study effect on adherence and clinical outcomes Methods Study design and sample Data from 190 RCTs were included from an updated Cochrane review on interventions that intended to improve patient adherence to self -administered medications220. For overall methods of this review we refer to the main publication220. In brief, eligibility criteria for the Cochrane review were RCTs with unconfounded tests of adherence interventions, studies that reported at least one adherence measure ( e.g., pill count) and one clinical outcome ( e.g., blood pressure) with at least 80% follow -up, and included patients who had received prescription medication for a medical disorder, including psychiatri c diseases, but not for addiction. Data extraction Cochrane data were supplied in excel format. We retrieved the following items: Study ID Inclusion/Exclusion (eligibility) criteria Intervention and comparator details Details of outcome measurement for adherence and clinical outcomes Answers (Yes, No, Uncertain) and details to the following questions: \"Was the intervention explicitly theory based?\"; \"Were the reasons for not adhering to the medication(s) assessed in the recruited subjects at baseline?\"; \"Was there a statistically significant effect on adherence and clinical outcomes?\" Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 192 From the retrieved items, we: extracted all findings addressing the level of patient adherence as an inclusion criterion extracted all findings addressing determinants of non-adherence as inclusion criteria and attributed them to the corresponding determinants from our juxtaposition list97 and thereafter to the corresponding TDF dom ain ( Appendix A.5.1 ) attributed interventions from studies with extracted determinants directly to TDF domains because their complexity rendered attribution to interventions from the juxtaposition list inapplicable extracted all findings on adjustment of the intervention to individual patients' needs Two researchers (IA, SA) independently extracted and cod ed the relevant information. Both researchers discussed inconsistencies and an adju dicator resolved disagreements. Data analysis The following 6 features related to inclusion criteria, patient characteristics at baseline, and intervention design were selec ted ( Table 24): Is the level of adherence an inclusion criterion? Are determinants of non -adherence in the inclusion criteria? Does the intervention match determinants in the inclusion criteria (tailoring to the study population)? Are individual reasons for non -adherence assessed at baseline? Is the intervention adjusted to individual patient needs (tailoring to the individual)? Is the intervention design based on theoretical models? We scored each feature on an ordinal rating scale as \"No\", \"Uncertain\", or \"Yes\" corresponding to dummy variables from 0 to 2 used for statistical analysis. For each study, we computed a congruence score by summarizing the scores for each feature. A maximum score of 12 indicates congruence with all features. Statistical analysis The interrater -reliability for newly extracted data on determinants and intervention congruence was determined using Kappa statistics. We computed frequencies for each feature and medians, range, and interquartile range for the congruence score. We used a binary variable (\"Yes\" or \"No\") to describe whether studies were able to show a significant effect (i.e., significant difference between intervention and control groups) regarding adherence and clinical outcomes. We tested associations between ordinal variables (congruence score, individual features) and categorical variables (effects on adherence, clinical outcomes) using a Kruskal Walli s rank sum test. We tested associations Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteris tics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 193 between categorical variables using Fisher's exact test.

Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An i n-depth analysis of a Cochrane review 194 Congruence Score and effectiveness The 190 studies reported in total 212 different interventions. T he median overall congruence score was 3 (Range 0 - 11) with an interquartile range (IQR) of 3. Interventions with a significant effect on adherence had slightly higher median congruence score compared to interventions with no effect on adherence (3 .5 [IQR = 3] vs. 3 [IQR = 2]; p = 0 .28; Figure 39). Recruitment of non -adherent patients was the only individual feature significantly associated with effect ive interventions regarding adherence (p = 0 .003, Table 25). Clinical outcomes were not significantly associated with the overall congruence score (p = 0 .2, data not shown). \"Adjustment of intervention to individual patient needs\" showed the highest association with effective interventions regarding clinical outcomes (p = 0 .07, Table 25). The fusion of the categories \"uncertain\" and \"no\" did not affect the associations with neither the overall score nor individual features (data not shown). Interventions with a significant effect on adherence were more likely to report significant clinical outcomes (OR = 6, CI 95% = 3.1 - 12, p < 0 .00001). This highly significant association remained significant (p = 0 .0001) for a subsample of 29 studies with the highest quality (i.e., lowest bias according to the or iginal review220).

The majority of the studies (180; 95%) did not report the level of adherence as eligibility criterion. Two studies remained uncertain 304, 305 and another two did not report any eligibility criteria306, 307. Project D2 | Can congruence between patient c haracteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 196 Determinants of non -adherence as inclusion criteria Eligibility criteria contained determinants of non -adherence according to our juxtaposition list97, either as inclusion criteria (n = 66, 35%), exclusion criteria (n = 33, 17%), or both (n = 61, 32%). Ninety -nine studies (52%) contained 11 modifiable determinants in the eligibility criteria. A total of 13 unmodifiable determinants were pr esent in 130 studies (68%, Figure 40). Of the 190 studies, 46 (24%) included patients with modifiable determinants of non six \"Psychological problems\" ( e.g., multiple medications; n = 10), \"Lifestyle\" ( e.g., drug or alcohol abuse, smoking; n = 7), \"Adverse events\", \"Continuity of care\", and Specificity of regimen\" ( Figure 40). The modifiable determinants most frequently excluded were \"Psychological problems\" (n = 39), \"Lifestyle\" (n = 19), and \"Physical difficulties\" ( e.g., visual or hearing impairment; n = 14). Unmodifiable determinants most prevalent in the inclusion criteria were \"Change of therapy\" (e.g., new treatment or treatment adjustment; n = 30), \"Age\" ( e.g., children or elderly; n = 29), \"Durat ion of treatment\" ( e.g., long -term treatments; n = 17), and \"Illness severity\" ( e.g., uncontrolled conditions; n = 17). Patients with unmodifiable determinants of non -adherence were excluded because of \"Cognitive impairment\" (n = 45), \"P olymorbidity\" (n = 8), \"Age\" (n = 5), and \"Level of education\" ( e.g., literacy, n = 5).

An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 197 Figure 40: Cumulative number of studies (n = 160) with modifiable and unmodifiable determinants of non- adherence in the eligibility criteria according to our juxtaposition list97 Matching between interventions and determinants in the inclusion criteria A total of 47 determinants were present in the 46 studies that reported a modifiable determinant of non -adherence in the inclusion criteria. The determinants contributed to only 3 of the 11 TDF categories in our juxtaposition list ( Figure 41). According to our juxtaposition list, 30 (64%) were addressed by the intervention (e.g., during an intervention for patients with psychological problems as determinant of non -adherence, life events before and after the diagnosis of schizophrenia were assessed and methods to avoid or resolve these circumstances were discussed308). In a further 16 interventions (34%), the determinants did not match the inclusion criteria. One case was uncertain whether the intervention addressed the determinant (family therapy for patients with schizophrenia without further information about the intervention components 309). The majority of determinants and interventions were in the TDF category \"Emotion\" (Psychological problems, n = 25, 53%). The most diverse category was \"Environmental context and resources\" with th e determinants \"Pill burden\" modifiable unmodifiable Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 198 (n = 10, 21%), \"Adverse events\" (n = 3, 6%), \"Continuity = 1, 2%) and \"Specificity of regimen\" (n = 1, 2%). Figure 41: Matching of interventions to determinants of non- adherence in TDF categories according to our juxtaposition list. Of the 11 TDF categories in our juxtaposition list, only 3 were used for matching. Reasons for non -adherence assessed at baseline Of the 190 studies, 18 (15%) assessed the individual participants' reasons for non -adherence at baseline, 115 (60%) did not, and it was uncertain for 47 (25%). Extracti on of the determinants of non- adherence assessed at baseline was impossible for most studies due to approximate phrasings. In some studies, there was only a mention that the reasons were assessed without further details; in others, only a selection of the reasons was indicated. Adjustment of intervention to individual patient needs Of all reported interventions (n = 212; some studies used multiple interventions), 143 (68%) were adjusted to the individual needs of the patient, 46 (23%) were not personalized , and 23 (11%) remained uncertain. Personalization was most often achieved by individualization of education, counselling, or treatment plans based on patient needs. Theoretical models The majority of the studies did not report whether the intervention was theory -based (n = 118, 63%). A third of the studies (n = 66, 34%) explicitly based their intervention on theory and 6 (3%) remained uncertain. We identified 33 different underlying theories or models, and some studies reported more than one theory or mode l on which the intervention was founded. The most prevalent theories were the self-efficacy theory (n = 8) and the s ocial cognitive theory (n = 7). The s ocial learning theory, the health belief model and the Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 199 information -motivation -behavior skills (IMB) m odels were used 5 times each (Appendix A.5.2 ). Discussion Because the effects of interventions intended to enhance adherence to medication are largely uncertain220, we hypothesized that the analysis of congruence betw een patient characteristics and interventions would help resolve some of the uncertainty. Among 190 analyzed RCTs, the \"inclusion of non -adherent patients\" was the sole single feature significantly associated with effective interventions regarding adherenc e. For example, a study assessing a reduction in blood pressure found significant differences between intervention and control groups only for initially non -adherent patients310. Another study from 1978 found a reduction in blood pressure only in patients declaring difficulties remembering to take their medication and concluded that these patients may benefit the most from an intervention.36 The inclusion of non- adherent patients is likely to increase the difference in adherence measured between control and intervention groups. Alternatively, the inclusion of adherent patients is likely to mask any actual effective interventions because adherence can only be improved to a certai n extent ('ceiling effect')311. Indeed, baseline adherence was often high when reported312. Our results thus confirm the assertion of other authors that emphasizes the importance of including non- adheren t patients in adherence studies225, 226. All other individual features (i.e. \"determinants of non -adherence as inclusion criteria\", \"tailoring of interventions to the inclusion criteria\", \"reasons for non -adherence assessed at baseline\", \"adjustment of intervention to individual patient needs\", and \"theory based interventions\") were not associated with effective interventions. At first sight surprising, this result may be explained by the large impact of the i nclusion of adherent patients instead of non- adherent patients. Indeed, any association with these features might be masked if patients are already well adherent. Ultimately, adherence interventions should aim at improving clinical outcomes. We showed that interventions with a significant effect on adherence also significantly improved clinical outcomes. However, clinical outcomes were neither associated with the overall congruence score, nor with individual features. This might partly be explained by inter vention components influencing clinical outcomes, but not adherence, such as placebo effects resulting from ameliorated patient -physician relationships. Our results are not surprising. Despite the frequent occurrence of patient characteristics in the incl usion criteria, only few were relevant for adherence interventions. For example, only Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adh erence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 200 3% of the studies screened adherence level before recruitment, and 24% included patients with modifiable determinants of non -adherence (such as pill burden). In addition, the majority of modifiable determinants fit into the TDF domain \"emotion\" and only half of the interventions matched the modifiable determinants of the patients. In line with our stud y, another review showed that interventions mostly targeted determinants in different TDF domains, such as \"memory, attention consequences\". 294 This lack of congruence between patient characteristics and interventions might diminish the overall effect. Finally, although two -thirds of the interventions were adjusted to individual patient needs, most of the interventions did not target non- adherent behavior. In other words, they were not tailored to specific determinants of non -adherence, and thus, were unlikely to show a significant effect. Our juxtaposition list was helpful to assess and code patient characteristics and interventions. It is noteworthy that the most frequent modifiable determinants were \"psychological problems\" (such as depression or schizophrenia), \"pill burden\" or \"lifestyle\" (such as alcohol or ill icit drug use), probably because these determinants are well defined and easy to measure in comparison with other modifiable determinants, such as \"motivation\" or \"access to care\", and thus bett er suited as inclusion criteria 313. The high frequency of \"psychological problems\" as eligibility criteria deserves some comments. This attraction may be explained by the many studies reporting non- adherence amongst patients with these conditions. Interventions can target treatment (best to measure with modifiable determinants) or be operationalized through motivational interviewing, which is recognized as method of first choice when b ehavioral change is the outcome314, 315. Unfortunately, we were not able to use our juxtaposition list to classify individual determinants of non- adherence assessed at baseline, due to the poor reporting of study procedures. Unlike with clearly stated inclusion criteria, the description of baseline assessment generally remained unspecific concerning the determinants of non-adherence (e.g., reasons were assessed but not described in the manuscript263, 316- 318). Strengths and limitations Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic assessment of congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventio ns. We used an explicit juxtaposition list to assess congruence. With this approach, we reached near -perfect interrater -reliability between the two researchers extracting the data. Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 201 We acknowledge some limitations. First, we selected six features to assess congruence between patient characteristics and interventions based on theoretical considerations from the literature.58,225, 226, 273, 293, 296, 297 However, other features might exist and might contribute to congruence. Second, the coding of the single features was a long cognitive process and was often linked to assumptions of the descriptions found in the studies, especially for the \"determinants of non- adherence at inclusion\" (e.g., \"analgesia prescription that included instru ctions for administration every 4 hours\" described a very specific regimen and thus the determinant \"specificity of regimen\" was assigned to this inclusion criterion 41) or \"tailoring of the intervention to those determinants\" (e.g., the intervention \"formulating a daily medication schedule\" was matched to the determinant \"pill burden\" because a reduction in the frequency of dosing might allow a reduction of the number of pills to take 319). Because these features were not reported ver y precisely in the retrieved studies, our coding may be afflicted with some uncertainty. However, the very high inter -rater reliability ( = 0 .92) between the extractors minimizes this bias. On the other hand, a bias is less likely towards the more obvious coding of the features \"including non -adherent patients\" and \"intervention based on theoretical models\" - which showed the strongest association with adherence outcomes - because they were clearly described in the majority of studies. Third, effectiveness of interventions depends on further quality -related features, such as risk of bias, which we did not control for. Likewise, interventions might be more effective based on other factors , such as underlying disease, setting, type of medication, etc. We did not control for the many heterogeneities in the studies, which could contribute to the weak associations identified. Fourth, we did not differentiate between the interventions, although different types of interventions might be more effective than others t o tackle the same determinant. Various studies have analyzed these associations and have found that some interventions are indeed more effective than others 58,320. Fifth, we did not adjust for multiple statistical testing. However, the significant associations were strong (p < 0 .01) compared to all other associations and would have remained significant with adjustment, e.g., using a stricter p - value. Finally, a dich otomous classification of intervention effects into significant and non - significant may be too coarse to reveal a significant association. Other measures , such as the effect size , might offer a better resolution321, but large methodological differences between studies hin dered the meaningful calculation and comparison of effect sizes between studies. Project D2 | Can congruence between patient characteristics and interventions explain effectiveness in medication adherence studies? An in -depth analysis of a Cochrane review 202 Conclusion We tested the hypothesis that effective adherence interventions may be explained by congruence between patient characteristics and interventions. For this purpose, we developed a score consisting of 6 features and applied it to 190 RCTs. We showed for the first time that including non -adherent patients was significantly associated with effective adherence interventions. We also showed that effective adherence interve ntions were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes, a relationship that remained significant in a subset of the highest quality studies. However, we were not able to demonstrate an overall positive effect of congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions. This might be explained by the presence of only six studies that included non -adherent patients and by the inter -dependency of the remaining five features with the first (i.e., the inclusion of non -adherent patient s). In order to obtain clinical benefits from effective adherence interventions, we encourage adherence researchers to select non - adherent patients, measure individual determinants at baseline in a systematic manner, and select and tailor interventions bas ed on the (most important) modifiable determinants in the study population, also in a systematic manner.

Although adherence has been studied for decades, it has been described as the least understood health behaviour18. Many disciplines are invol ved in medication adherence research, such as medical and pharmaceutical sciences, behavioral and social sciences, but also b iostatistics and e conomics. Neither discipline can be ignored when attempting to provide a scientific contribution relevant to pati ents. Consequently, this thesis covers a broad range of topics and employed a multitude of methodologies, from semi -structured qualitative patient interviews to large - scale quantitative data analysis. Several projects contributed to this thesis. Project A aimed to harmonize the use of single pharmaceutical care (PhC) definition amongst European researchers and practitioners. Since the widely -cited definition by Hepler and Strand from 199099, new terms and concepts of medicines -related patient care , such as \"medicines management\", \" disease management \"86, and \" medication therapy management\" (MTM)87, have added confusion to the meaning of PhC and its differentiat ion from other terms. We identified existing definitions of PhC in a literature review and paraphrased them in a generic format regarding provider, recipient, subject, and outcome of PhC. During a one - day workshop of the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe (PCNE), 24 experts from 11 countries defined PhC based on the literature review and in accordance with the c onsensus - oriented decision -making model103. As a result, the new definition of PhC direc tly derives from previous definitions and is intended to unite the current understanding of PhC with respect to the evolution of this practice philosophy during the last 35 years. It is important to note that \" pharmaceutical care\" is not equal to the \"care around pharmaceuticals \", a misunderstanding especially common among representatives of the pharmaceutical industry. Since its publication, the new definition has been cited 29 times as of December 2016. In addition to the publication , describing the results of the literature review and the process of the definition development, PCNE published a position paper discussing the wording and scope of the new definition 123. Three aspects of the PCNE definition deserve special attention: The explicit mentioning of the pharmacist as the responsible provider of PhC, the focus on the care of individuals, and the optimization of medicines use as main subject. Although many professionals are involved in the provision of pharmacotherapy, it is clearly the center of atten tion for pharmacists. Consequently, pharmacists have also been identified as ideal providers for interventions to improve safe and effective medicines use 278. Defining PhC as General discussion and conclusions 206 the \"contribution\" of the Pharmacist implies collaboration between healthcare providers and does not exclude other providers. The focus on indivi duals is crucial for the improvement of adherence interventions. Adherence is a multi -dimensional behavior affected by many different determinants that are unique to every patient. PhC describes a process that includes a follow -up to determine the impact o f the service, distinguishing PhC from simple counselling. The optimization of medicines use as the main subject of PhC is highly relevant to adherence management and has been endorsed as one of four key roles of pharmacists by the International Pharmaceut ical Federation (FIP) 84. Project B aimed to evaluate the prevalence of the prescription of split preparations for elderly patients, a common practice that increases regimen complexity and may have a negative impact on adherence51. Previous studies showed that every fourth tablet is split in ambulatory setting s322, 323 predominantly because of dose adjustment, swallowing difficulties, or costs324, 325. We performed a first -time analysis of data from a blister center providing repackaging services for community pharmacies. Our study showed that fragments of tablets represented 8.5% of all tablets ordered in 2012 by 53 community pharmacies in n orthern Switzerland for institutionalized patients. Thus, institutionalized patients with pharmacy - filled medication management aids (MMAs) receive less fragmented medications than primary -care patients without medication management provided by their pharmacy. Our results most likely represent the cases in which fragmenting is necessary for dose adjustments, because fragmenting at the blister center is reserved for cases where no lower dosage strength is available on the market. Almost half of all patients in our study received 2 or more fragments. Although necessary in clinical practice, splitting tablets poses a potential safety issue and should not be performed with the intent to reduce costs 326. A recent study in Swedish community pharmacies showed that 52.5% of the patients with a prescript ion for split tablets preferred whole tablets of the appropriate strength rather than split tablets327. Pharmacy -filled MMAs might reduce the proportion of fragments, increasing safety of and adhe rence to polypharmacy. Although the majority of older adults report at least part -time use of MMAs69,70, the authors of a review of the effects of MMA concluded that the design and targeting of these devices need further research64. Studies with e -MMA often only report aggregated data77-79. With Project C , we aimed to explore the use of a remote electronic medication management aid (e -MMA) for prepackaged polypharmacy in ambulatory patients. The e -MMA has been developed and used in the Netherlands for community -dwelling elderly patients requiring assistance with their General discussion and conclusions 207 medication management. However, no data on e- MMAs from Switzerland exists and the device has never been used in patients with opioid -assisted treatment ( OAT ). In Project C1, we provided a group of participants with the e- MMA for two weeks and assessed their experience in a Focus Group. Participants rated 10 of 17 general attributes as applicable to the e- MMA and five as unsuitable. Attri butes pertained to 3 interrelated themes: Product design, patient support and living conditions. Our results sh ow that the assessed e - MMA meets most of the general requirements set for an MMA in the areas of patient support and implications on patient habits. Envisaged target groups were patients with time- sensitive medication regimens, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together to prevent accidental intake of the wrong medication. The major limitation voiced by our participants concerned the restricted mobility inherent to a bulky device that needs continuous power supply. T his aspect may restrict the applicability of the e -MMA to patients with limited mobility, an aspect also mentioned for a similar e -MMA evaluated elsewhere174. A recent qualitative study with pharmacists, physicians, nurses, social workers, and patients about their views on electronic multi -compartment medication devices showed similar results regarding the applicability of such devices328. Our analysis of medication profiles of patients receiving OAT from an outpatient addiction service in Basel, Switzerland (Project C2) showed an increase in the number of substances and medications over 10 years , leading to an increased risk of drug -drug interactions, adverse events, and non -adherence. Additionally, we observed a shift from the traditional OAT with liquid Methadone to solid formula tions , such as Buprenorphine and sustained - release Morphine. D isorders such as ADHD further complicate the safe and effective therapy of the se complex patients. The deteriorating health of older drug users, the risks associated with non- adherence, and redu ced mobility are putting considerable strain on existing resources. Because existing nursing homes or home care services are not suited to accommodate patients with substance use disorders, ambulatory treatment and surveillance are provided as long as poss ible. As a result, the cost of providing care to the ageing drug users is supposed to increase and innovative solutions to optimize medication management compatible with OAT are needed. Little is known about the adherence of opioid dependent patients to t heir medication. Few cohort studies from Switzerland and France assessed self -reported adherence of HIV -infected drug users during the past 4 and 1 weeks, respectively 228, 229. Patients with stable opioid substitution therapy report significantly higher adherence than patients without substitution 228. In Project C3, we evaluated a novel medication supply model using the e-General discussion and conclusions 208 MMA and showed sustained treatment implementation and suppressed viral loads in two opioid dependent HIV patients over 1 .7 and 2.5 years, respectively. Our novel supply model offered a sustainable solution to assure adequate implementation and persistence with treatment. Additionally, repackaging of medications in unit -of-use pouches might prevent disturbance in case of changes in treatment , such as the up -titration of anti -dementia therapy, or initiating of preventive and irregular treatment, such as prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii. However, we experienced technical problems that compromised monitoring and increased workload for the care staff. These were unpredictable, not reproducible, and complicated the care process. Nevertheless, patients declared satisfaction with the novel supply model, probably because the technical problems did not jeopardize medication intake. The success of our intervention in t hese complex patients demonstrates the potential of our supply model. In a subsequent single -subject study ( Project C4), we aimed to assess the use and effects of the e -MMA with a mixed -methods approach. Our results suggest that the evaluated e -MMA ensures high taking adherence in opioid -substituted patients with polypharmacy. Furthermore, the audible and visual alerts might improve taking and timing adherence, but do not reduce time variability. Arguably, the importance of timely dosing depends on the resp ective therapy. Due to differences in pharmacologic properties, it is more important for some medications to be taken at exact times than for others. The probability of therapeutic success under imperfect adherence compared to perfect adherence has previo usly been described as \"forgiveness\" of medications 242. Thus, the specificities of a patient's treatment (e.g., forgiveness or presence of on -demand medications) should always be considered when assessing adherence to polypharmacy. Obviously, the e -MMA might offer the largest benef its to patients with low adherence and unmet clinical outcomes. However, consideration of humanistic outcomes might be more appropriate in multi- morbid patients with polypharmacy. Quality of life (QoL) is reportedly lower than average in patients with subs tance -use disorders, and improvements in QoL should be a priority for these patients 244. Our results indicate trends towards the improvement of mental QoL, which might be explained by the additional attention participants received during the study. Participants reported independence and security of medication availabi lity as biggest advantages of the e- MMA. Importantly, the e -MMA did not interfere with the care they received from the OAS. General discussion and conclusions 209 Our results suggest that the use of the e -MMA might be applicable for patients with: High perceived necessity of treatment Self-reported non -adherence Unforgiving treatments Low social support Psychologic distress However, other alternatives should be considered for: On-demand treatments Problematic substance use In addition to improvements in clinical and humanistic outcomes, higher adherence has been associated with reduced overall healthcare costs224. With Project C5, we aimed to perform a cost -of-illness evaluation of patients receiving OAT and polypharmacy and to establish a cost - comparison model for the novel supply model compared to standard medication supply. We found high total costs, with over SFr 109'000 per patient per year. Direct medical costs amounted to almost 30% of all costs, half of which accrued for psychiatric treatment and a third during hospital admissions. Surprisingly, costs were neither associated with age, sex, or number of medications. We estimated the annual costs for the novel supply model at roughly SFr 2'500 for repackaging of medication, leasing of the dispenser, refill every 3 weeks, technical support, and OAS visits once weekly. This accounted for 2.3% of total costs, with repackaging into unit -dose pouches and leasing for the dispenser being the main cost items. The remuneration for the weekly rep ackaging of polypharmacy in Switzerland is paid for by health insurances when patients receive three or more medications ( OAT not included). The increasing polypharmacy and complexity of treatments could add more stress to caregivers when dispensing medica tions together with OAT at the OA S, which could lead to dispensing errors272. Compared to the fragmented dispensing provided by the OAS, unit -dose pouches offer various benefits: Patients receive medications for every intake time in a sealed pouch labelled with the date and time of intake. The repa ckaging process is subject to strict quality controls and the identity of the contents is guaranteed. This reduces the potential for erroneous dispensing almost to zero. Our cost -comparison model showed that the novel medication model might be almost cost -neutral but might provide clinical benefits as demonstrated Project C3. Other alternatives to the traditional supply model, such as assisted living or nursing homes would be much more expensive and further reduce patients' independence. General discussion and conclusions 210 In summary, Project C demonstrated that the e -MMA might offer a suitable solution to supply polypharmacy to older patients with OAT . Although ingestion of medication is not guaranteed when pouches are dispensed, the e- MMA improves implementation of regimens by assurin g the availability of the right medications at the right times. A white paper recently published by Philips claims that the average taking adherence with this e -MMA was 93% in a sample of 1379 patients monitored for 6.7 months on average329. Patients in this sample took an average of 3 doses per day, and adherence remained stable when having more than 2 daily dosing times. A multicenter randomized controlled trial assessed the feasibility and efficacy of the e -MMA in Parkinson's disease330. The study included 78 patients aged over 40 years, with a minimum of 4 daily dosing times, and experiencing on -off fluctuations. The results suggest no significant overall improv ement after 3 and 6 months in any of the outcomes (Linear Disability Scale, quality of life [QoL], experienced health status, QoL of caregivers ). However, exploratory sub -analysis suggested that older patients with more severe symptoms might benefit from t he intervention. Adherence was not reported in this study, impeding the interpretation of the results. However, t he evidence from this thesis and the white paper from Philips suggest that patients using the e -MMA demonstrate sustained persistence and suffi cient implementation of dosing regimens. Thus, a failure to show clinical improvements could be explained in three ways: First, study duration may be too short to show a significant difference. Second, adherence of participating patients could be already h igh at inclusion or improved during the study in both groups equally. Third, despite being non -adherent at inclusion, participants may not benefit from the intervention. The first reason would be relevant to all clinical trials, the second and the third ap ply to all adherence intervention studies. According to the latest update of a Cochrane review, interventions intended to enhance medication adherence show uncertain results and evidence of their effects remains low 220. The review included RCTs with unconfounded tests of adherence interventions, studies that reported at le ast one adherence measure ( e.g., pill count) and one clinical outcome ( e.g., blood pressure) with at least 80% follow -up, and included patients who had received prescription medication for a medical disorder, including psychiatric diseases, but not for add iction. It has been argued that including patients regardless of their current adherence might impair effectiveness of adherence interventions 225, 273. Furthermore, the selection of appropriate patients and tailoring of adherence interventions has been suggested to improve effectiveness of interventions 273. General discussion and conclusions 211 Thus, Project D aimed to assess the congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions in published trials and investigate its association with intervention effects. A plethora of determinants of non -adherence and interventions to improve adherence have been reported in countless studies. Although several attempts have been made to suggest interventions base d on various determinants, shared categories to include determinants and intervention did not exist. In Project D1 , we extracted salient determinants and interventions and categorized them in shared categories derived from the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). We identified 103 different interventions and 42 determinants that we divided in 26 modifiable and 16 unmodifiable determinants. In our view, this distinction between modifiable and unmodifiable determinants is essential for the choice of adherence interventions. In order to be effective, we postulate that interventions have to target current modifiable patient determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable patient determinants. We were able to match all interventions and the 26 modifiable determi nants in 11 shared categories, not using 3 of the original TDF categories. Because it was not specifically developed for interventions and patient determinants of non -adherence, some adaption of the TDF to specifically address adherence might prove useful in future projects. In Project D2 , we analyzed data of the abovementioned Cochrane review with regards to congruence between characteristics of the included patients and the adherence intervention. We showed for the first time that the inclusion of non -adherent patients is significantly associated with effective adherence interventions . Moreover, effective adherence interventions were significantly associated with improved clinical outcomes. Due to an insufficient number of studies including non -adherent pa tients, we were not able to draw conclusions about the effect of congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions. Limitations Limitations of the individual projects were discussed thoroughly for each study. The overall limitations of this thesis were: the p harmacists- centered view on adherence . As discussed previously, different healthcare providers and disciplines contribute to adherence research and management. Most researchers involved in the design and supervision of this thesis General discussion and conclusions 212 were pharmacists, and therefore the results might be biased towards a favorable view of the pharmacist . the involvement of one researcher in the design, collection of data, analysis, and interpretation . This might lead to a bias in favor of the research h ypotheses (observer bias)331. the change in behavior of people when they are monitored more closely (Hawthorne effect)332. Research about adherence is often affected by the Hawthorne effect, which might have affected our results in Project C. However, monitoring of adherence was part of the intervention and would persist outside of rese arch projects. the evaluation of the electronic dispenser in Project C in a local setting. T he OAS is specialized to treat opioid -dependent patients with mental disorders and these patients may potentially show a higher complexity compared to other opioid - dependent patients. Nevertheless, our results are relevant to other settings, as the increasing age and associated complexity is observed globally. the small sample sizes, which limit the validity of our results . Different research designs have been ranked in a hierarchical manner, mainly to provide guidance to appraise the evidence in systematic reviews. Various versions of a so -called \"evidence pyramid\" ranked study designs from weak to strong. The hierarchy represents the internal validity (risk of bias) of study types. Consequently, case reports and case series rank lowest, followed by case control and cohort studies, randomized clinical trials (RCTs), and systematic reviews and meta -analyses on top. Recently, a new pyramid has been proposed , advocat ing for less strict separation of study designs and view ing systematic reviews as \"lenses \" through which evidence is assessed 333. In the field of adherence research, the applicability of results in practice plays an important role. Consequently, some versions of the pyramid have been adapted to incorporate applicability . As a result, N -1 trials as a form of single -subject research have been placed above RCTs, because their results apply directly to patients 334. Conclusions The following conclusions derive from this thesis: It was possible to paraphrase definitions of PhC using a standardized syntax focusing on the provider, recipient, subject, outcomes, and activ ities of PhC practice. During a one-day workshop, experts in PhC research agreed on a definition, intended to be General discussion and conclusions 213 applicable for the p resent time, representative for various work settings, and valid for countries in - and outside of Europe. Tablet splitting is a pharmaceutical care issue with potential consequences on adherence, playing a major role in dosage adjustment s for geriatric patients . Although limited to certain regions, fragments of certain tablets are prescribed against the recommendations from the manufacturer. Pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to introduce new strengths to an existing range of produc ts, in view of an optimization of seamless care between the different health care professionals. If splitting tablets is necessary, patient counseling is recommended and pharmacies should deliver the appropriate tools or offer repackaging into MMAs for pat ients. The appearance of MMAs, but also its functionality and the whole medication supply process play an important role with regards to the design and targeting of MMAs . In a focus group discussion, the evaluated e -MMA with pre -packaged polypharmacy met the majority of the requirements set to an MMA. Patients' living conditions like mobility remain the key determinants for their acceptance of the e -MMA. Especially patient s with time -sensitive medication regimens, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together might benefit from the e- MMA. With our database analysis, we confirmed the globally observed shift towards an older population wi th OAT in a Swiss setting . An increase in the number of substances and medications might lead to an increased risk of drug -drug interactions, adve rse events, and non- adherence. Traditional OAT with liquid Methadone is increasingly being replaced by solid f ormulations , such as Buprenorphine and sustained -release Morphine. Other disorders further complicate the safe and effective therapy of the complex patients. Taken together, the developments of the past 10 years call for new care models for older patients with OAT . The increasing age and complexity of their medication might warrant a closer collaboration of health care professionals. Alternative supply models to assist patients with their medication management and tosupport medication adherence are needed for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy. Continuous medication supply and persistence with treatment over more than 1.7 years, timing adherence of more than 90%, and suppressed HIV viral load are first results supporting the feasibility of a novel supp ly model with an e -MMA for polypharmacy . Medication supply with the e-MMA may ensure correct implementation of dosing regimens for opioid -substituted patients with polypharmacy when certain General discussion and conclusions 214 prerequisites are considered. Various drawbacks limit the applicability of the e- MMA to monitor adherence to polypharmacy. A careful assessment of patient's barriers to medication adherence and a structured medication review should be the first steps to provide meaningful information from electronic monitoring. The flexibility of single - subject research designs offers considerable advantages for the evaluation of adherence interventions. Cost -of-illness for older patients with OAT and polypharmacy is high, especially when considering indirect costs , such as productivity loss due to disability. According to our cost comparison model, t he novel electronic medication supply model increases overall costs marginally, but might offset the costs of more expensive alternatives , such as nursing homes. In published trials on medication adherence, the congruence between interventions and determinants can be assessed with matching interventions to determinants. To be successful, medication adherence interventions should target current modifiable patient determinants and be tailored to the unmodifiable patient determinants. A 6-item score to assess congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions was not significantly associated with intervention effects in 190 RCTs included in a Cochrane review . The presenc e of only six studies that included non - adherent patients and the inter -dependency of this item with the remaining five precluded a conclusive assessment of congruence between patient characteristics and adherence interventions. The selection of non -adhere nt patients, measuring adherence -related patient characteristics at baseline, and matching interventions to the study population should be the first steps to design future adherence studies capable of demonstrating effectiveness of their intervention. Outlook Adherence is a complex behavior with individual determinants and no one- size-fits-all solution. As stated in the definition that has been developed as part of this thesis, pharmaceutical care focuses on individuals. This fits well with the idea of adherence interventions that target modifiable determinants and are tailored to unmodifiable determinants of non- adherence. In line with the global shift of the pharmacist's role towards the provisio n of patient -centered services, this thesis encourages pharmacists to assume responsibility for the provision of adherence support for patients with polypharmacy in primary care , including older drug users with OAT . In line with our research, o thers have General discussion and conclusions 215 recognized the need for alternative supply models for OAT . As an example, a research group from the US has registered a trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of a novel platform that integrates text messaging reminders, secure e -MMAs, and daily remote brief motivational recovery support visits with supervised self -administration of buprenorphine via videoconferencing335. Future research about the e- MMA should aim at: quantitatively evaluating the validity of our findi ngs in larger populations of patients with high perceived necessity of treatment, self -reported non -adherence, unforgiving treatments, low social support, and high psychologic distress. However, other alternatives should be considered for: on -demand treatm ents and problematic substance use. developing and implementing robust care models for older patients with polypharmacy and opioid -assisted therapy. evaluating the effectiveness of the e -MMA in terms of clinical, humanistic and economic outcomes . evaluating the long -term benefits and cost -effectiveness of the novel supply model. Although currently not marketed for patients with OAT , the e -MMA evaluated in this thesis is expected to launch in the USA and other parts of Europe in the near future336. Other companies, including the pharmaceutical industry, start to consider adherence in the development of their products more often. Similar to standards for research in traditional drug development, the scientific evaluation of adherence interventions requires clear guidelines and best practice. A cornerstone has been laid with the ABC taxonomy of adherence in 2012 208. Frameworks for planning and critiquing medication adherence research have been published for prospective study designs337 and retrospective database research338. ESPACOMP, the European Society of Patient Adherence, Compliance, and Persistence, has recently developed the E SPACOMP Medication Adherence Reporting Guidelines (EMERGE) for the reporting of adherence research339. These efforts are needed, because adherence research during the past decades has struggled to provide consistent and convincing resu lts for adherence interventions using classical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) . This thesis showed that congruence between patients included for R CTs and interventions used in these studies was consistently low. Apart from the large heterogeneity and low methodological quality often cited as the reason for the inconsistent results, the choice of study design may play an important role as well. Population -based trials are indispensable to demonstrate safety and efficacy of treatments that should become available to the public. They may also be approp riate for public -health studies, for which the societal General discussion and conclusions 216 perspective is of greater interest than effects on individuals. F or a behavior such as adherence, with interventions that must be tailored to individual modifiable and unmodifiable determinants, study designs other than those focus ing on mean group effects (i.e. RCTs ) might be more appropriate. By definition, adherence interventions are designed to improve effectiveness, not efficacy of treatments. In the age of precision medicine and personalized healthcare, in which affordable devices that collect healthcare data of individuals become ubiquitous, research designs that account for individual variability should become standard to assess effectiveness as soon as safety and efficacy have been demonstrated for any intervention 340. Especially in the field of polypharmacy, where no two patients receive the same treatments for the same diseases, single -subject research designs might be the solution to demonstrate effectiveness of adherence- enhancing interventions at the patient level. Future research to improve adherence to polypharmacy should aim at: exploring the potential of the novel approach to use single -subject designs in adherence research. providing guidelines for the appropriate design and analyses of single -subject trials in adherence research, including recommendations for statistical analysis. developing instrume nts to reliably assess modifiable and unmodifiable determinants of non -adherence and to select appropriate interventions in research and practice. This thesis provide s first experiences with the use of single -subject research in combination with electronic monitoring of adherence. With a fraction of the costs of a large RCT, our results demonstrate the advantages and limitations, as well as potential target groups for t he e-MMA. Our matched categories for determinants of non -adherence and interventions might provide guidance for the choice of interventions to be assessed during the course of such single -subject trials. Ultimately, solid single -case trials that are conduc ted as part of everyday pharmaceutical care might fill the gap between efficacy and effectiveness for medication treatments.

Behaviour Theories Frequencies Overview CII IV Appendix XIII Hello, my name is Samuel Allemann. I'm a PhD student of the Pharmaceutical Care Research Group from the University of Basel in Switzerland. Many people struggle with taking their medication as prescribed, especially when dealing with polypharmacy, meaning that th ey have to take multiple medications at the same time. The behavior of taking medication as prescribed is called medication adherence. A simple method to improve adherence is the use of a pillbox that holds a predefined number of medication organized by day and time according to a patient's individual therapy plan. To judge if these interventions work, one has to measure adherence. This can be done simply by asking the patient, counting the remaining pills, looking at pharmacy claims data or use an elect ronic device that records date and time of medication removal. Recently, electronic pillboxes emerged, reminding patients with acoustic or visual alerts to take their medication, dispensing the right medication at the right time, and tracking each event . We wanted to know people's opinions on an electronic pillbox and for whom it may be suitable to use. We gave the pillbox to 6 people and let them use it for 2 weeks. Then all participants met for a focus group. First, we asked them what they thought were important attributes of a system assisting with their medication management. Participants came up with 13 different attributes they thought were important. We added another 4 to a total of 17 attributes. We grouped the attributes into broad er themes around product design, patient support and living conditions. Second, we let them vote whether the electronic pillbox possessed these attributes or not. Participants rated 10 attributes as clearly applicable to the electronic pillbox. Five att ributes were rated as unsuitable and the votes on 2 attributes were equally distributed. Third, we wanted to know who they imagine could make use of such an electronic pillbox. Envisaged target groups were patients with time -sensitive medication regimen s, patients with dementia, the visually impaired, and several patients living together to prevent accidental intake of the wrong medication. Further prospective, randomized and controlled intervention trials should aim at quantitatively evaluating the v alidity of our findings in larger populations of these patients. Appendix XIV A.2.2.
