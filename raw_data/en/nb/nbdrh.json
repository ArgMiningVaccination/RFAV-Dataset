But it is important that we broaden our view of grief and loss to include many of the experiences encountered by those who abuse substances. Grief often is a very complex part of the substance abuser's life. Many have experienced important losses early in life and may begin abusing substances as a way of coping. In turn, the addiction can facilitate other losses such as job, relationships and even freedom. But often, we do not consider the losses that occur when giving up the use of a substance. This pre-sentation will explore the basic concepts of grief and loss theory as applied to work with substance abusers. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10012 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 302 Brief Emotion-focused Couples Relationship Enhancement: Improving Attachment Security, Intimacy, Stability and SatisfactionBarry G.

Compulsive sexual behavior, referred to as sex addiction, 46 | ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guideThURSDA y | march 18 is a co-occurring mental health condition that can be overlooked or misdiagnosed by counseling professionals, contributing to recidivism rates.

Pre-conference Learning Institutes 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10031 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 301 Clinical Boundaries and Ethical Decision Making: How Supervision Can Help!Paula J. Britton, PhD, Christopher M. Faiver, PhD, Cecile Brennan, PhD Maintaining appropriate boundaries can be a struggle for counselors, especially early in their careers. Due to the inherent evaluative component of supervision, supervi-sees may \"hide\" certain boundary challenges from their supervisors and make clinical decisions in isolation. This workshop provides an overview of the literature related to clinical boundaries and discusses the importance of su-pervision in recognizing and managing boundary dilem-mas. The LI includes lecture with critical case examples; the \"ethics game,\" which includes discussion with peers regarding ethical scenarios; and a case demonstration of a supervisee who struggles with a boundary dilemma. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10032 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 302 Enhancing the Supervision Process: Incorporating Expressive Art Activities in Clinical SupervisionPeggy L. Ceballos, PhD, Clarrice Rapisarda, PhD The use of expressive arts in the supervision process can help supervisees to conceptualize cases, reflect on the client-therapist relationship, increase self-awareness, gain perspective of the clients' experience and understand the counseling process. In this interactive workshop, you will learn the underlying principle for choosing expressive arts activities to incorporate in supervision, as well as guidelines to process these activities. Practical examples on incorpo-rating various expressive art modalities into participants' current work will be addressed. Presenters will use video-tapes, case examples and experiential activities to illustrate the use of expressive arts during supervision sessions. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10033 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 318 Domestic Violence and Trauma-informed Best Practices Minna Davis, MA Professionals who don't specialize in domestic violence may unknowingly serve 60 percent or more of individuals who are affected by it. Y et, many professionals don't ask questions about violence. Additionally, trauma recovery is a rapidly developing field. This workshop will help par-ticipants understand domestic violence and the relation-ship between traumatic stress and domestic violence. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10034 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 319 Suicide Prevention, Assessment and Intervention: Practical Information for CounselorsDarcy Haag Granello, PhD, Paul F . Granello, PhD Suicide is the 11th-leading cause of death overall and the second-leading cause among adolescents, yet the average amount of time spent on the topic of suicide in counselor education programs in less than one hour. This program will provide participants of all skill and experience levels, in all types of settings, with concrete, practical information on suicide assessment, prevention and intervention. An extensive booklet of information will provide more details and depth for participants to implement prevention pro-gramming in schools and communities and to conduct culturally and developmentally appropriate risk assessments. Intervention guidelines for treatment are included. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10035 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 303 When Talking Won't Work: Implementing Experien-tial Activities With Resistant and Addicted ClientsWilliam Bryce Hagedorn, PhD Clinical work with resistant and addicted clients poses no end of therapeutic challenges. Minimization, rational-ization, denial and lying plague this client population like no other. Similarly, most addicted clients, especially those at the beginning of their recovery process, have little to no motivation to change. As a result, traditional talk therapy often proves ineffective. Other modalities, especially those that are experiential and creative in nature, are necessary. Attendees will leave with a bevy of creative exercises. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10036 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 304 Culturally Sensitive Counseling Process Skills With Hard-to-reach Boys and MenMark S. Kiselica, PhD Boys and men who adhere to traditional notions of masculinity have a tendency to rely on themselves during times of crisis. This tendency is exacerbated for boys and men of color who have a distrust of counselors due to the historical maltreatment of ethnic and racial minorityindividuals by the mental health system. The purpose of this workshop is to help counselors learn how to overcome ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guide | 53FRIDA y | march 19 these barriers by describing culturally sensitive process skills shown to be effective in engaging hard-to-reach males incounseling. Numerous male-friendly rapport-building strategies will be demonstrated, and suggestions for broach-ing sensitive racial issues that can emerge during counseling with boys and men will be discussed. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10037 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 305 Teaching Multicultural Counseling With a Conceptual Approach Courtland Lee, PhD, Jessica M. Diaz, MA, Juliana Unis Castan, BA The purpose of this LI is to present an alternative per-spective on and method of teaching a multicultural counseling course for counselor educators and students, as well as for counseling practitioners. Rather than present information on counseling with specific cultural groups, the course methodology offers perspective on important concepts to consider when counseling across cultures. 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10038 Advanced, Convention Center, Room 317 Positive Approaches to Sexual Offender Treatment: The Good Lives Model in ActionRobert Scholz, MA, Charles Flinton, PhD Many of the treatment approaches used with sexual of-fenders are risk-need models. The Good Lives Approach bolsters these models by emphasizing the importance of enhancing offenders' lives so they can meet their own basic human needs in more adaptive and prosocial ways. This presentation will apply the theoretical foundations of the Good Lives Model to individual and group psychotherapy with offenders. Participants will engage in discussion and experiential exercises focusing on understanding each of the 10 goods (e.g., Healthy Living, Knowledge, Excellence in Work & Play, Excellence in Agency, Inner Peace, Relat-edness, Community, Spirituality, Happiness and Creativity). 5:30 pm - 8:45 pm 10039 Introductory, Convention Center, Room 320 Developmental Advocacy for Counselors and Educators Shannon D.

At present, the counseling profession has not yet been able to resolve the conflict that exists relative to professional identity. During this interactive session, participants will have an opportunity to explore the meanings associated with being a professional counselor. A developmental lens will be used to clarify the abound-ing confusion surrounding this struggle, and strategies for professional advocacy will be provided. 7:30 am - 8:30 am ALGBTIC Day of LearningLGBT AcademyMulticultural Counseling AcademyProgram ID #109, Convention Center, Room 304Ethical Service Delivery to Dual-minority Clients: What Do We Know and How Do We Treat GLB People of Color?60-Minute Program Dustin K.

Coaston, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, Kerry E. Sebera, Christina M. BakerGraduate programs are becoming more rigorous, and in a weakened economy, more students are working additional hours to meet financial obligations. As a result, some students are reporting feeling burnout during internship, far before graduation. Some believe burnout is an un-avoidable consequence of helping. Therefore, counselor educators must be prepared to identify, intervene and, ideally, prevent burnout in their students. The presenters will introduce findings from a study aimed at determining the prevalence of burnout among current master's-level counseling students. Presenters will define the problem and the impact on the profession and discuss strategies to promote wellness within the program and beyond\u2014to the clients we serve. 7:30 am - 8:30 am ACEG Sponsored SessionChild & Adolescent Counseling AcademyHuman Development Across the Lifespan AcademyProgram ID #121, Convention Center, Room 414The 40 Development Assets for Children60-Minute Program William G.

Researchers were given the opportunity to provide support to 300 students in the AVID Program who attend an urban middle school in Orlando, Fla. through the efforts of 16 University of Central Florida Holmes Scholars. Researchers then sur-veyed the participating AVID middle-school students and non-AVID students to observe if there were differences in self-efficacy between the two groups. By understanding the effect on student self-efficacy through collaborating with programs such as AVID, counselors can enrich and empower youth who are traditionally underrepresented in postsecondary education.

Toporek, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, CA, Patricia V an VelsorAs counselors, we are often in positions where our clientsand our job require that we provide services that span multiple roles. Clients who have limited economic resources or are from marginalized cultural groups often need services beyond individual counseling. Traditional approaches tend to emphasize the need to keep these roles separate; yet, our training in multicultural and advocacy competencies charges us to infuse skills and knowledge to impart these services with counseling as the core. This workshop will explore challenges when blending these roles and develop a model based on preliminary results of a qualitative study of counselor role integration and participants' experiences. 11:00 am - 11:30 am PCA Sponsored SessionProgram ID #136, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS12The Supervisory Relationship: A Critical Review of Current Supervisory Measures30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Kimberly R.

BurnesIn the current political climate in the U.S., increasing attention has recently been given to issues affecting lesbians and gays. A dialogue has opened regarding major issues of the LGBT movement, such as marriage rights, protection from discrimination and harassment, and the Don't Ask Don't T ell policy. However, bisexuals are often a sidenote in these conversations. While many issues for bisexuals mirror those of gays and lesbians, biphobia continues to be a problem within both queer and straight communities. This presentation will look at using the ACA Advocacy Competencies, Multicultural Competen-cies, ALGBTIC LGB Competencies, and ACA and APA ethical guidelines to supervise and train counselors to work with bisexual individuals. 11:00 am - 12:00 pm Program ID #156, Convention Center, Room 303Moving Narrative Into Action: A Refreshing Look at the Counseling Process60-Minute Program, AdvancedAllen Ivey, University of Massachusetts - Amherst, Amherst, MA, Mary Bradford Ivey, Carlos P .

However, most practi-tioners have neither the training nor the confidence to address spiritual constructs in therapy. This program will present several research and clinically based interventions that counselors\u2014particularly those who do not identify as \"faith-based\" clinicians\u2014can use to effectively incor-porate spirituality into the treatment of bereavement and facilitate personal and spiritual growth as a result of the grieving process.72 | ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guideSATURDA y | march 20 11:00 am - 12:00 pm Rehabilitation Counseling & Disability Issues Academy Program ID #163, Convention Center, Room 321Obesity and Disability: A Growing Problem for Rehabilitation Counselors60-Minute Program Chad Betters, Winston-Salem State University, Winston-Salem, NCObesity has become a major public health concern in the United States. This epidemic has also become an occupa-tional health problem as well by greatly increasing work disability. Subsequently, there is an impact on rehabilita-tion counseling practices, as recent literature has clarified the obesity-disability relationship, as well as how this dynamic challenges rehabilitation counseling services. This session will inform the audience about the obesity epidemic and the ongoing paradigm shift within the rela-tionship between obesity and disability.

Nichols, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, Catherine AugustineThe motivation for employing complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is to seek or maintain health, and the fact that more than one-third of individuals in the United States use at least one unconventional form of health care puts the spotlight on the array of healing and lifestyle traditions of many cultures (Astin, 1998; Kessler et al., 2001). This presentation will review the research and rationale behind CAM use, exposing audience members to some of the practices (e.g., biofeedback) being adopted by clients. Presenters and attendees will discuss the im-pact and importance of understanding clients' individual worldviews related to CAM use and how the counselor's reaction and understanding of CAM use can affect, both positively and negatively, the counseling relationship. 11:00 am - 12:00 pm College Counseling AcademyHuman Development Across the Lifespan AcademyProgram ID #165, Convention Center, Room 402In Search of Myself: Predictors of Exploration and Commitment During the Resolution of Emerging Adults Identity Crises60-Minute Program, AdvancedMatthew Gerstacker, Academic Skills Enhancement Program - North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC College and university campuses, overflowing with emerging adults, are analogous to McLuhan's (1962) global village. Within this setting, an individual must be immediately knowledgeable and have an increased aware-ness of a diverse range of cultural values and behaviors. Simultaneously, each young person is sifting through an array of worldviews, personal ideologies and copingmechanisms in an attempt to find an identity that is socially and personally accepted. Therefore, the goal of this presentation is to provide attendees with an interac-tive opportunity to discuss and apply psychosocial, social cognitive and evolutionary concepts to the processes of coping mechanism selection and identity conflict resolu- tion among emerging adults. 11:00 am - 12:00 pm Program ID #166, Convention Center, Room 405 Not Just a Weekend Warrior: Addressing the Needs of Reserve Component Soldiers and Their Families60-Minute Program Lisa Yanity, United States Army Reserves, Atlanta, GAMobilized Reserve soldiers and families encounter chal-lenges that the Active Component (AC) does not.

The Role for Counselors in Leadership Development60-Minute Program Thomas Peterson, Self-Employed, Washington, DCThe leadership development terrain is deep with differentperspectives on the optimal attributes, behaviors and organizational conditions for leadership. Often, however, these perspectives both fail to consider the complexity of leadership development across all levels and are under-prescriptive in describing how leaders can be created within their organizational constraints. Because leadershipbehaviors are deeply rooted in identity development and organizations are inherently relational, counselors are uniquely positioned for leadership development. This session will inform counselors about the best way to fit in this terrain, the ways in which they can have the biggest impact, and the nature of the risks and pitfalls. 11:00 am - 12:00 pm ACA Author SessionProgram ID #170, Convention Center, Room 415Counseling Strategies for Loss and Grief: Unique Grief and Unique Grievers60-Minute Program Keren Humphrey, 4 Directions Consulting, Rockwall, TXThe experience of loss and grief is highly individual and intensely personal, reflecting a unique interaction of person, loss event and the multiple contexts in which loss and grief occur.

However, assessment has been limited primar-ily to clinical laboratory observations between infants and parents, and primarily mothers. Emotional availability has rarely been evaluated quantitatively especially among older children, adolescents and young adults. Even more, its relationship to academic achievement is still relatively unknown. The purpose of the study was to quantitatively examine the relationship between both maternal and paternal emotional availability and students' academic achievement. The presenters will discuss the results of the study and potential implications drawn from the findings. 2:00 pm - 2:30 pm Program ID #191, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS19Pre-union Counseling: Strategies for Working With Same-sex Couples Prior to Life Partnerships, Civil Unions or Marriages30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session W . Matthew Shurts, Montclair State University, Montclair, NJPre-union counseling (counseling provided to same-sex couples prior to life partnerships, civil unions or marriages) has received minimal attention in the counseling litera-ture.

The Manag-ing Client Resistance Self-Efficacy Scale (MCRSE) is a valid and useful tool for identifying problematic resistant behaviors counselors may encounter. Designed to provide increased awareness of the specific behaviors that present the most problems for professionals, it can be a powerful and useful tool for counselor development. This session will delineate the procedures used to develop and validate the MCRSE, including the principle component factor analysis used to identify its factor structure. Implications for use by counselor educators are discussed. 4:00 pm - 4:30 pm Program ID #279, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS11Fitting a Triangle Peg Into a Round Hole: Preparing School Counselors-in-training to Work With LGBTQ Students30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Melissa Luke, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY , Kristopher M. GoodrichResearch reveals that LGBTQ youth are at risk for a number of issues compared with comparable heterosexual and gender normative peers. This is a concern because few school counselors have been trained to identify or address the unique issues found within this population. This presentation will address the current gap for school counselors by exploring the experiences of school coun-selors-in-training while they are paired with LGBTQyouth for a course project. Qualitative research methodology, as well as some descriptive statistics, will be presented, and implications for school counselor training will be addressed. 4:00 pm - 4:30 pm Program ID #280, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS12 From Classroom to Office: Top 10 Tips for Counselors 30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Clarrice A.

Alessandria, West Chester University, West Chester, PA, Maria A. Kopacz, Heather LappiA key function of counselors is promoting healthy psycho-social development. Awareness and understanding of clients' ethnic identities gives practitioners insight into clients' values, worldviews and ethnic self-perceptions that inform culturally appropriate techniques. Little research recognizes the ethnic diversity in the White majority group and eth-nic identity's role in White college students' development. Literature suggests that college experiences play a vital role in choices made about students' views of the identities bestowed by parents and whether they will modify, reject or enhance them. Results of a study that examined eth-nic identity development and its persistence among first- through fourth-generation Italian Americans will be shared.98 | ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guideSATURDA y | march 20 4:00 pm - 4:30 pm Program ID #288, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS20Metaphor and Counseling: Contextual and Cultural Applications30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session A.

Young-Morrison, Marywood University, Scranton, PAThe purpose of this presentation is to generate a pro-fessional stage model from which I conceptualize the process of counseling. Throughout this presentation, I will frame my stages and techniques using more of a creative aesthetic from a combination of my dance education and my clinical training. The more I study psychology, the more I realize how much the relationship between a therapist and a client parallels that of a choreographer and a dancer, both requiring the understanding of the delicate balance that can exist between two people. These stages include collaboration/assessment, rehearsal/toolbox building, performance/catharsis, reflection/feedback and, finally, taking bows/termination. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm ACEG Sponsored SessionProgram ID #295, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS3Career Clusters and Military Careers: A New Look30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Daniel W .

GoodmanThe chronic underachievement of African American students continues to concern both counselors and educators. This presentation will use transgenerational trauma theory to explore the impact of educational hegemony on African American students. An increased understanding of transgenerational trauma and educa- tional hegemony can enable counselors to differentiate between traumatic stress and other behavior or learning problems among school-aged children. The presenters will discuss current research on traumatic stress and sys-temic oppression and provide case examples illustrating the implications for educational success and psychologi- cal well-being. Recommendations for culture-centered counseling interventions will be provided. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #300, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS8Counseling Emergency Management Professionals: Research-based Strategies for Promoting Satisfaction and Mitigating Stress30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Jean M. LaFauci Schutt, The George Washington University, Washington, DCEmergency management professionals are among the work-ers who contribute to disaster relief, yet they remain one of the most understudied of helpers. They share role conflicts and ambiguities, as do health care workers, and have been part of discussions about the success of their role in post-Katrina recovery. It is important to understand the devel-opmental contributions of their work exposures to their psychological health. This session will discuss how counselors can apply the components of three more models to help mitigate burnout and promote compassion satisfaction for these critical players in the disaster ecology. Especially im-portant is what the research can say about the role of ethnic identity in the path from exposure to stress and satisfaction. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #302, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS10Incorporating Traumatology Into CACREP- accredited Program Curricula: A Workshop for Counselor Educators30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session, AdvancedKarin Jordan, University of Akron, Akron, OHT oday, counselor educators are challenged with the task of incorporating traumatology (disasters, crisis and other trauma) into their curricula to meet the 2009 CACREP standards.

Robertson, V anderbilt University, Nashville, TN, Andrew J. FinchThrough a qualitative approach, the expression and pro-cess of coping among five Hurricane Katrina survivors was explored. After analysis of the individual recollections, four global themes emerged: connection, sense of purpose, safety and detachment. Further analysis revealed helpless-ness and hopefulness as central, intersecting themes. A model was created to illustrate the relationships among the expressions of coping, time and themes of helplessness and hopefulness. Findings suggest a new way of conceptual-izing trauma that includes multiple events and continued exposure to traumatic stimuli. Further studies can examine the validity of these constructs, as well as the applicability of the model to other survivors of trauma. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #304, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS12Imagine a Cross-cultural Experience: Interactive Guided Imagery as a Catalyst of Cultural Awareness30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Michael S. Rankins, Lindenwood University, St. Charles, MOThis cross-cultural activity is an interactive experience in guided imagery and invites participants to explore emo-tions associated with immersion in an unfamiliar cultural milieu while remaining in the workshop setting. Dur-ing this process, participants will draw upon their own inner resources to evoke strong mental imagery. Through this experience, participants are led toward an enhanced awareness of the means by which they interpret the world around them and the subjective nature of this interpreta-tion. Ultimately, participants are encouraged to reflect on their own cultural identity and how \"truths\" may be challenged by developing a greater appreciation of the perspectives of persons from other cultures.5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #305, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS13Trekking Through Grief: Laying a Path through the Landscape of Loss30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Melanie J. Drake Wallace, Jacksonville State University, Bir-mingham, AL, Nancy J. FoxThis is an interactive program designed to 1) provide caregivers with a basic understanding of key issues related to child and adolescent grief, 2) provide participants with a set of creative and pragmatic interventions to support the grieving child or adolescent, and 3) provide participants an opportunity to discuss current challenges and brainstorm possible interventions. Each child or adolescent's journey into grief is uniquely personal; therefore, truly effective support requires the practitioner's insight and intuition about when to intervene and when to simply allow the individual to lay his or her own path of healing. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #306, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS14Counseling Adolescents and College Students in Perceived Ability, Responsibility, Adaptability and Accountability30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session, AdvancedChad C. Luke, Lehigh Carbon Community College, Allentown, PAFewer than half the students who begin college will complete their degree even six years later. For those who begin and don't complete the process, the repercussions can be significant. Therefore, research into the factors surrounding students' intent to remain in or leave college may provide directions for counselors. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among self-efficacy, locus of control, coping behaviors and attitudes toward education-employment on retention among college students at a small liberal arts college. Results and impli-cations for counselors are presented. 5:00 pm - 5:30 pm Program ID #307, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS15The Kuwait Anti-drug Awareness Campaign30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Hymoud Fahad Alqashan, Supreme Committee of Drugs Prevention, Kuwait The Kuwait Anti-drug Awareness Campaign was estab-lished to keep children safe from the increasing problem of illicit drugs in Kuwait.

Angelo Juergen Gomez, University of Maryland, College Park, MDThe new century brings new challenges for the coun-seling profession in America, where groups such as the Latino populations, among others, present unique charac-teristics as an ethnic group made up of people of various races and racial mixtures and many national origins. Consequently, this diversity forms groups of people socially bound across various countries and multiple immigration stories. Thus, the counseling profession is in need of new approaches to counseling beyond the traditional theories. This presentation explains the novel concept of transna-tionality and how it can provide a new and innovative method to counsel transnational clients. 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm Rehabilitation Counseling & Disability Issues AcademyProgram ID #324, Convention Center, Room 303Postsecondary Counseling/Support for Students With LD and PTSD Veterans: Poor Neurological, Technological and Cultural Competency90-Minute Program, AdvancedAlejandro A.

Specific case examples will be provided that counselor educators, practitioners, and trainees may use in applying the competencies to further their own awareness, knowledge and skills to work ethically and affirmatively with transgender clients of diverse backgrounds. 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm Child & Adolescent Counseling AcademyLGBT AcademyProgram ID #326, Convention Center, Room 305An Integrative Model for Helping Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual the Coming-out Process: Empowerment and Advocacy90-Minute Program, AdvancedCyndi H. Matthews, Texas A&M University - Commerce, Commerce, TX, Carmen SalazarLesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) youth find the coming-out process challenging in a predominantly heterosexual society. They may be faced with rejection from family,peers, religious leaders, religious doctrines and even themselves. Presenters will introduce a new integrativemodel to assist counselors in helping LGB youth to negotiate the coming-out process. The model describes internal and external factors that impact the coming-out process and counselor strategies and interventions for em-powerment and advocacy. If counselors are aware of the factors that can contribute to making coming out a more positive experience, they can counsel, warn and discuss with teens the liabilities and benefits of coming out to those around them. 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm Program ID #327, Convention Center, Room 317 Don't Just Sit There: Engage the Brain\u2014Using Movement, Writing and Creativity to Increase Effectiveness90-Minute Program, AdvancedEd E. Jacobs, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV , Chris SchimmelClients and counselors do not always need to be seated. The brain likes to be engaged, and the brain likes novelty. We will show the value of having clients move to differ-ent seats, move in circles or go to the whiteboard. Not all counseling needs to be just talk/listen. This creative workshop will focus on unique ways to use movement (not dance or yoga) in counseling. Many simple, effec-tive techniques will be demonstrated in which the client is out of his/her seat. Also shown will be more than 20 unique ways to use lists, charts, drawings and diagrams to enhance the counseling. Ideas will be presented that can be used next week in counseling sessions.

We will look at the rela-tionship between community violence, symptoms of PTSD, externalizing aggressive behavior and internalizing self-de-structive behavior. Community violence has long been rec-ognized as a significant public health problem and remains a serious issue, especially in light of the demonstrated relation-ship between violence exposure and psychosocial maladjust-ment. Clinicians who work with youth in school and private settings need culturally relevant and practical tools to work with this population and their families.106 | ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guideSATURDA y | march 20 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm Couples & Family Counseling Academy Counseling Ethics & Legal Issues AcademyProgram ID #329, Convention Center, Room 319 Open Relationships: Challenges in Practice and Ethics 90-Minute Program, AdvancedLoriAnn Stretch, Capella University, Minneapolis, MN, Heloisa PortelaSignificant gains have been made in society's acceptance of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals. Some states even have legal protections for these populations. However, society has not extended the same acceptance to individu-als in polyamorous relationships. In fact, there continues to be a strong bias in our society that the only acceptable relationship is one where two individuals are in a closed/monogamous relationship. The presenters will draw from research and their own personal and professional experi-ences to challenge counselors' traditional views of relation-ships and explore how they can better equip themselves to help clients who are in polyamorous relationships. 5:00 pm - 6:30 pm Counselor Education & Supervision AcademySocial Justice AcademyProgram ID #330, Convention Center, Room 320Efficacious Supervision Through a Social Justice Lens: Implications for Supervisors and Supervisees90-Minute Program, AdvancedKatherine M.

DinkelOne of the many challenges that professional school counselors (PSCs) encounter revolves around the inap-propriate roles they can be called upon to fulfill, such as participating in the discipline process.

Children and adolescents are often referred by others and, therefore, may be more reluctant to engage in the counseling process. Developmentally, they may not be able to articulate their concerns or express their feelings. Culturally, they may require diverse approaches to facilitate a counseling relationship and effect change. 130 | ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guideSUNDA y | march 21 The purpose of this workshop is to introduce participants to numerous developmentally and culturally appropriateinterventions to use in individual counseling with childrenand adolescents. The interventions that will be presented are engaging, drawing from the expressive arts, develop- mental theory, and rational-emotive/cognitive behavioral therapy. In this session, counseling professionals will learn why cognitive behavioral approaches uniquely address the developmental issues of childhood and adolescence and how to adapt this theoretical approach to help young cli-ents deal with typical developmental problems. Original cognitively based interventions for a variety of presenting problems, such as anxiety, depression, grief, perfectionism, stress, procrastination, acting out, bullying, anger, under- achievement and relationships, will be discussed and/or demonstrated.

Smith, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV , Kok Mun Ng ACA AnnuAl ConferenCe & exposition progrAm guide | 133SUNDA y | march 21 This study examined the relationship between attachment quality and perceived family-of-origin expressive atmo-sphere (FOEA) in a sample of 279 participants. Multivari-ate analysis of variance was used to examine associations between attachment style and FOEA, and hierarchical regression was employed to analyze FOEA as a predictor for attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance.

While other such forms exist, they are often long and difficult to maintain. The authors had previously developed a concise form for students to document their ongoing client loads that also allowed them to report and reflect upon each supervision session. This original CARE note form was received with great enthusiasm by supervisors, and the authors received many requests to develop a similar form for site supervisors. We developed the CARE-S supervision form for site super-visors in response to this demand.3:00 pm - 3:30 pm Program ID #473, Convention Center, Exhibit Hall, Booth PS13Same-sex Marriage in California: Voices From the Front Lines30-Minute Project/Research Poster Session Michael S.

Bryce Hagedorn, University of Central Florida, Orlando, FL, Craig S. CashwellBlaise Pascal suggested that addictions occur as a faulty at-tempt to fill a \"God-sized hole.\" If addiction is a disease of spirit, it follows that recovery is, at least in part, a healing of the spiritual dimension of the individual. Counselors see clients who are seeking answers to difficult questions such as \"Why am I hurting?\" and \"How can I let this go?\" For many clients, answers come from exploring spiritualmeaning and acknowledging a \"God-shaped hole.\" Without an emphasis on clients' spiritual needs in the counseling process, however, clients miss an opportunity to explore and develop their spiritual selves as part of the recovery process.

Coun - selors are often involved either in a forensic capacity (con-ducting formal child custody evaluations) or in a clinical capacity (treating the family, one or more of the children, or one of the parents). In a highly charged emotional environment, the potential is high that the counselor may become drawn into the adversarial process and inadver-tently engage in questionable professional behavior. Fear and frustration can often be the overriding emotion for one or both parents; in that environment, counselors can very quickly find themselves on the receiving end of ethical, regulatory or legal complaints. The presenters will identify counselor behaviors and clinical situations that give rise to some of the most frequent legal and ethics complaints and will give suggestions to help counselors minimize their risk. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Counselor Education & Supervision AcademyProgram ID #582, Convention Center, Room 408/409Suicide and Gaming: Using Serious Games as a Pedagogical Tool to Teach Suicide Prevention and Assessment60-Minute Program Carrie A.

Help-seeking Attitudes and Coping Styles Among Kenyan University Students60-Minute Program, AdvancedMuthoni Kimemia, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Carbondale, ILThe practice of formal counseling is a fairly new concept in Kenya. It has been utilized heavily in the war against HIV/AIDS, with the practice of pre-test and post-test counseling taking root during the past few years. Because of this, there is a tendency to associate counseling with HIV/AIDS, thereby hindering the uptake of counselingservices among the Kenyan population. Additionally, among many Kenyan tribes, mental illness bears a stigma that might also hinder the admission of a problem for which one could use some counseling. This presentation presents findings of a study conducted with Kenyan uni-versity students to investigate help-seeking attitudes as well as coping styles. 7:30 am - 8:30 am Program ID #591, Convention Center, Room 317What Counselors Need to Do to Deal With the Impact of Evidence-based Practice60-Minute Program, AdvancedPatricia Kyle, Southern Oregon University, Ashland, OR, Josie WilsonIncreasingly, counselors are required to demonstrate they are utilizing evidenced-based practice, (EBP), which em-phasizes manualized treatments that can remove creativity from the counseling process.
