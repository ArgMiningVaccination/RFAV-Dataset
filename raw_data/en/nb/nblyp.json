Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall rev ert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: A report on the grants management audit of GOCPYVS was due on December 31, 2021, following significant erroneous grant reversions in fiscal 2020. This report was delayed multiple times and is now expected to be complete by the end of fiscal 2023. GOCPYVS expanded the fiscal years audited to include fiscal 2022 given the delays that it experienced in contracting with an accounting firm and ongoing mistaken reversi on of grant funds. This language requires submission of the report to the Governor and the budget committees discussing the findings of this audit, the corrective actions taken by the office to address the findings, and the actual expenditures for all grants budgeted within GOCPYVS in fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022. D21 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 22 Information Request Fiscal 2020, 2021, and 2022 audit report Author GOCPYVS Due Date July 1, 2023 Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: Further provided that it is the intent of the General Assembly that total awards provided to service providers through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) grant program through the Governor's Offi ce of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services (GOCPYVS) in fiscal 2024 should be at least the same amount that was made available to all non- State service providers combined during fiscal 2023. No funding may be awarded to State agencies or programs until the total funding awarded to non- State victim services providers combined is no less than the fiscal 2023 level. For the purposes of identifying a State agency or program, it is the intent of the budget committees that higher education institutions, t he Baltimore Police Department, and other quasi -State entities be excluded from that definition and be included in the category of non-State victim services providers. Further provided that $500,000 of the general fund appropriation for GOCPYVS made for the purposes of general administration may not be expended until, prior to providing fiscal 2024 awards and no later than August 1, 2023, GOCPYVS reports to the budget committees on: (1) each proposed grant award; (2) how priority has been given to non- State victim services providers; and (3) the amount of VOCA funding held in reserve. In addition to the official report, data shall be provided in an electronic format subject to the concurrence of the Department of Legislative Services (DLS). The budget committ ees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds not expended for this restricted purpose may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted. Further provided that $500,000 of the general fund appropriation for the purposes of administration may not be expended until GOCPYVS submits a report by November 1, 2023, regarding the federal VOCA funding. The report shall include: (1) total active VOCA grant awards as of January 1, 2023, including grant number, implementing agency, project title, start date, end date, amount of award, jurisdiction of implementation, and the brief description/abstract of the grant; (2) for each VOCA grant award in item (1) and for any other VOCA grant awards made D21 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 23 subsequently, a description of whether for the federal fiscal year beginning October 1, 2023, the award was continued, awarded, or otherwise funded, including the grant number, implementing agency, project title, start date, end date, amount of award, jurisdiction of implementation, and the brief description/abstract of the grant; (3) the amount of unexpended funds for each open 3- year VOCA grant and the reason funds are unexpended, including whether they are held in reserve for future grants; (4) identification of the respective amount of funds expended for the purpose of direct provision of services, administration, and that which went unobligated for the federal fiscal 2019 and 2020 3-year funding cyc les; (5) comparison of aggregate -level performance measures or outcome measures of the State's VOCA program for fiscal 2017 through 2023 or as many recent years that GOCPYVS is able to provide; (6) identification of the legislative appropriation for VOCA and the actual level of spending for each State fiscal year, beginning with State fiscal 2016 through 2023; and (7) identification of any decrease or other change between the legislative appropriation for VOCA and the actual level of spending for VOCA for each Sta te fiscal year identified in item (6), and the reason for any and all disparities that may exist between the legislative appropriation and the actual spending level. In addition to the official report, data shall be provided in an electronic format subject to the concurrence of DLS. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds not expended for this restricted purpose may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any othe r purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted. Further provided that, unless an E xecutive Director is appointed and working at the Governor's Office of Crime Prevention, Youth, and Victim Services (GOCPYVS) by April 1, 2023, no funding provided under the federal Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) provided through GOCPYVS may be awarded to State agencies, programs, or held in reserve until each victim services provider who received funding during fiscal 2023 has been awarded funding at no less than the same level as fiscal 2023 to continue services to victims of crime during fiscal 2024, provided that all services proposed by the victim services provider are allowable under federal VOCA regulations. For the purposes of identifying a State agency or program, it is the intent of the budget committees that higher education institutions, the Baltimore Police Department, and other quasi -State entities be excluded from that definition and be included in the category of non- State victim services providers. D21 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 24 Further provided that if funding under the VOCA is reduced, funding shall be awarded in the following manner: (1) victim services providers who received funding during fiscal 2023 shall receive all available VOCA funds, and funding for each provider may only be reduced by the same percentage as other providers, unless a provider submits a grant request for a lower amount; and (2) in the event that funding is not available, each grant shall be reduced by the same percentage unless a provider has requested reduced funding. Non- State providers shall be fully funded prior to any award to a State agency and prior to the retention of reserve funds. If additional State or federal funding becomes available, such cuts shall be restored. No VOCA funding may be awarded by GOCPYVS except in a manner that gives priority to continuing funding for non- State victim services providers who received funding during fiscal 2022, have the capacity to continue to provide services to victims, and have submitted an application for services that are allowable under federal VOCA regulations. Further provided that $500,000 of the general fund appropriation for GOCPYVS made for the purposes of general administration may not be expended until, prior to providing fiscal 2024 awards and no later than August 1, 2023, GOCPYVS reports to the budget committees on: (1) each proposed grant award; (2) how priority has been given to non- State victim services providers; (3) whether each grant is equal to fiscal 2023 awards; and, if it is not, the identification of the difference in funding and justification for this difference; and (4) the amount of VOCA funding held in reserve.

In addition to the officia l report, data shall be provided in an electronic format subject to the concurrence of DLS. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds not expended for this restricted purpose may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted. Further provided that $500,000 of the general fund appropriation made for the purposes of administration may not be expended until GOCPYVS publishes the total amount of funding from federal VOCA funds on GOCPYVS' website, including funds available from prior years and including the specific amounts held in reserve from each federal 3- year award. GOCPYVS shall provide the budget committees with a letter, no later than November 1, 2023, indicating that this data has been made available on its website and provides the web address to this data. The budget committees shall have 45 days fro m the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds not expended for this restricted purpose may not be transferred by budget amendment or D21 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 26 otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted. Further pro vided that GOCPYVS is authorized to process a budget amendment recognizing additional State or federal funds to restore funding cuts to victim services providers if additional State or federal funding becomes available. Further provided that, upon request by a grantee and unless expressly prohibited by federal law, GOCPYVS shall permit grantees to carry over grant funds from one federal fiscal year to the next for up to 6 months. GOCPYVS shall take any steps needed to maximize the ability of grantees to carry over grant funds, including by requesting no- cost extensions for expenditure of federal funds granted to the State. Further provided that VOCA funds and State funds supplementing VOCA services will be administered in a unified process, including one Notice of Funding Availability and application, one grant period, and unified reports with separate accounting as necessary to comply with federal and State regulations. Further provided that grantees will be reimbursed on a monthly basis upon request for any State or federal grant award of $50,000 or more annually. Further provided that it is the intent of the budget committees that the primary purpose of the programs funded through the VOCA grant awards be to ensure continuity of trauma-informed, high- quality services for victims of crime. Explanation: This language requires the State fiscal 2024 VOCA awards to be awarded at a level equal to that of fiscal 2023. Priority shall be given to non- State service providers. The language restricts $500,000 pending the submission of a report by GOCPYVS detailing how non-State providers were giv en funding priority and proposed VOCA awards for the fiscal 2024 grant cycle. The language restricts an additional $500,000 pending the submission of information for all active VOCA grants as of January 1, 2023. The report should detail whether each of the grant recipients received the same level of VOCA funding during the federal fiscal 2022 VOCA grant cycle and the information on each of the grant programs receiving such funds. For each open three- year grant cycle (federal fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023), GOCPYVS should report the amount of currently unexpended funds, the reason these funds remain unspent, and whether they will be held in reserve. The report should provide further detail regarding the expenditure of funds for the two most recently completed funding cycles - federal fiscal 2019 and 2020. The report should provide a comparison of the program's aggregate outcome or performance measure in recent fiscal years. Finally, the report should identify any differences between the legislative appropria tion and actual spending levels for each closed out fiscal year, beginning with State fiscal 2017: State D21 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 27 fiscal 2017; 2018; 2019; 2020; 2021; 2022; and 2023. For any differences between the authorized and actual spending levels during the aforementioned S tate fiscal years, the report should identify and discuss the reasons for these disparities. There have been several concerns among members of the General Assembly and the advocacy community that reductions in federal VOCA funding will result in a loss of services for victims of crime in Maryland. Questions have arisen surrounding the impact of declining federal awards, the allocation of grant awards, and the levels of unspent funding. This language requires the State fiscal 2024 VOCA awards to be awarde d at a level equal to that of fiscal 2023 in order to ensure the continuity of victim services if an Executive Director is not appointed and working at GOCPYVS by April 1, 2023. Further, in the event that available funding is reduced or not available, priority shall be given to non- State service providers, and funding for all non- State providers must be reduced by the same percentage. Additionally, grantees will be able to request that grant funds may be carried over from one federal fiscal year to the next for up to six months. Grantees will be able to receive reimbursement on a monthly basis upon request for awards of $50,000 or more annually. The language restricts funds pending the submission of a report by GOCPYVS detailing how non-State providers were given funding priority and proposed VOCA awards for the fiscal 2024 grant cycle. The language restricts an additional $1.0 million pending the submission of VOCA data by November 1, 2023. Of this funding, $500,000 shall be released pending submission of a report providing information for all active VOCA grants as of January 1, 2023. The report should detail whether each of the grant recipients received the same level of VOCA funding during the federal fiscal 2022 VOCA grant cycle and the information on eac h of the grant programs receiving such funds. For each open three -year grant cycle (federal fiscal 2021, 2022, and 2023), GOCPYVS should report the amount of currently unexpended funds, the reason these funds remain unspent, and whether they will be held i n reserve. The report should provide further detail regarding the expenditure of funds for the two most recently completed funding cycles - federal fiscal 2019 and 2020. The report should provide a comparison of the program's aggregate outcome or performance measure in recent fiscal years. Finally, the report should identify any differences between the legislative appropriation and actual spending levels for each closed out fiscal year, beginning with State fiscal 2017: State fiscal 2017; 2018; 2019; 2020 ; 2021; 2022; and 2023. For any differences between the authorized and actual spending levels during the aforementioned State fiscal years, the report should identify and discuss the reasons for these disparities. An additional $500,000 shall be released pending submission of a letter, no later than November 1, 2023, confirming that data related to available VOCA fund reserves is published to GOCPYVS' agency website.

The statute does not mandate an annual appropriation into the grant fund but allows for appropriations through the General Fund. In the working approp riation and the allowance, $3.5 million is provided for rape kit testing grants. The committees request that GOCPYVS provide a report detailing the actual annual expenditures from this grant fund in fiscal 2022 through 2024 expenditures year to date and th e list of grant recipients and their respective grant award amount for each fiscal year.

This report should include an updated schedule that outlines key planning, construction, and financing milestones for Pimlico and Laurel Park. Explanation: Chapter 590 of 2020 created the Racing and Community Development Financing Fund to support improvements to the Pimlico and Laurel Park. When the legislation was enacted, Laurel Park was expected to be completed in 2022 so that racing could begin in February 2023. The project is three years behind schedule as no agreements have been signed and no design or construction has begun. MSA, in its January 1, 2023 report, noted that only one of the eight MOUs for Pimlico has been completed. The fund's debt service payments are supported by $17 million annually in lottery revenues. Increased interest rates since 2020 have reduced the proceeds expected from these bonds. Construction inflation and increasing the scope beyond what was authorized in 2020 have increased c osts. MSA estimates that available funds to renovate the facilities, as proposed by the expanded scope, are $160 million to $350 million less than available resources. The expectation is that the State will have to fund this, leaving less resources for other priorities. Further delays could further erode the value of the bonds and add to costs through increased inflation and an expanded scope. This contingent language requires MSA to enter into MOUs by September 30, 2023, and is intended to encourage the pa rties to enter into MOUs and keep State costs down. The language also requires a report by MSA on or before October 27, 2023.

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) should provide an update to the committees detailing: \u00b7 progress made toward reducing the vacancy rate; \u00b7 the status of the planned salary competitiveness survey; and \u00b7 steps that DBM has taken or plans to take to improve State recruitment and retention of employees. Information Request Progress in recruitment and retention of State employees Author DBM Due Date December 1, 2023 Modernization of the State Personnel System: The committees believe that the current vacancy crisis in State agencies creates the need and opportunity to modernize State Personnel Management System's (SPMS) recruitment, hiring, and retention system. While competitive compensation is a major compone nt of any solution, the State must also undertake significant reforms to the way it recruits and hires State employees. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) should create a Task Force on the Modernization of the State Personnel Management System. The task force should include: \u00b7 representatives of DBM's Office of Personnel Services and Benefits; \u00b7 State agency executives; \u00b7 collective bargaining unit representatives; F10A02 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 59 \u00b7 private sector human resources experts; and \u00b7 representatives of the Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), which has a personnel system independent of the SPMS. The task force should identify current State hiring practices that hinder recruitment and hiring, including: \u00b7 the approval process for agencies to begin hiring for a position; \u00b7 the length of time between stages of the hiring process; \u00b7 the requirements for selection to an interview; \u00b7 degree requirements; and \u00b7 any other impediments to the State hiring process The task force should consider such improvements as: \u00b7 proactive recruitment strategies, including in high schools and in cooperation with local workforce agency career counselors; \u00b7 rewriting position titles and job descriptions to be more attractive to potential applicants; \u00b7 continuous posting of appropriate positions; \u00b7 streamlining the hiring process to reduce the time from application to hiring; \u00b7 expanding career ladders, beginning with a low experience level and integrating on-the-job and classroom training; \u00b7 sponsorship of registered apprenticeships; \u00b7 focusing applicant requirements on relevant skills rather than degrees; and \u00b7 other improvements identified by task force members.

It is the intent of the General Assembly that the funds to support the COLA are transferred only to those agencies that have made progress in filling vacant positions and require funding to provide the COLA. Explanation: Personnel costs are overfunded by approxima tely $271 million based on the current vacancy and turnover rates, which will result in significant personnel cost savings. This language would delay the transfer of funds for a salary increase and express the intent of the General Assembly that funds are only provided to agencies that make progress in filling vacant positions. Amend appropriation for the purposes indicated: Funds Positions 1. Reduce the fiscal 2024 general fund allowance for statewide salary increases to reflect excess funding for personnel, excluding Higher Education. The amount of the reduction is the equivalent of increasing the statewide budgeted turnover rate, excluding Higher Education, by 1.5 percentage points. -65,000,000 GF Total Change -65,000,000 0.00 F10A02 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 61 Effect Allowance Appropriation Amount Change Position Change Position 2.00 2.00 0.00 General Fund 310,131,927 Total Funds 390,728,521 325,728,521 -65,000,000 F10A05 Office of Budget Analysis Department of Budget and Management Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 62 Committee Narrative F10A05.01 Budget Analysis and Formulation Submission of Select Budget Detail: The committees request that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) submit complete fiscal 2025 subobject detail by program for Comptroller Objects 08 and 12 by the third Wednesday of January 2024 in an electronic format subject to the concurrence of the Department of Legislative Services.

Reduce general funds for the Maryland Department of Health's (MDH) Maryland AIDS Drug Assistance Program (MADAP) major information technology (IT) project and authorize special funds. MADAP rebates that are appropriated as special funds have been used to support major IT projects. In recent years, spending has consistentl y been below projections, and the fund typically ends the fiscal year with a fund balance exceeding $50 million. Fiscal 2022 ended with a $50.2 million fund balance. This reduction deletes general funds proposed for the MADAP Case Management System project but does not reduce oversight costs. Should additional funding be needed, MDH is authorized to transfer MADAP special funds to support this project. -2,215,421 GF 2. Delete funds for the Department of General Services' AS400 replacement system major information technology (IT) project. This project's first appropriation was $1.6 million in fiscal 2023. Progress has been slow. The IT project request, which State law req uires for all projects, was not submitted until February 2023. Documents show that the project has not yet onboarded a qualified project manager.

The system will need to interface with other systems, like the eMaryland Marketplace Advantage procurement system. The Department of Information Technology (DoIT) is listed as the custodian of this project, but other key stakeholders include the Comptroller's Office, the Treasurer's Office, and the Maryland Department of Transportation. Replacing the system will require substantial funding and also agencies providing subject matter experts to support development. With so many key agencies, governance may also be a challenge. The committees are interested in the progress and development of the FMIS Replacement Major Information Techno logy Development Project. The committees request that DoIT submit a report each quarter providing an update on the project's current status, cost projections, and timeline. The report should detail the use of the fiscal 2024 budget, project development costs, and any changes in scope or timeline.

DoIT also has indicators that measure the workload and efficiency. However, the goal does not address value, and there are no indicators for costs. Many of the services that DoIT provides are comparable to services provided by the private sector a nd other organizations. DoIT should expand its MFR goals to include value and add indicators that measure costs and value. The department should report these indicators with the fiscal 2025 budget.

DGS' first MFR goal is to provide best value for customer agencies and taxpayers. This training program is consistent with this goal. As such, DGS should add an objective to its first goal a bout employee retention and appropriate training. DGS should consider performance measures such as (1) the number of employees in the program; (2) retention rates of employees that do and do not participate in the program; (3) career paths of employees that do and do not participate in the program; and (4) other measures of the training program's effectiveness.

Explanation: Section 3 -202 of the Transportation Article requires the General Assembly to establish the maximum debt outstanding each year in the budget bill. The level is based on the outstanding debt as of June 30, 2022, plus projected debt to be issued during fiscal 2024 in support of the transportation capital program.

Author City of Seat Pleasant Due Date January 1, 2024 Amendment No. 9 J00H01 Maryland Transit Administration Department of Transportation Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 79 Budget Amendments Add the following language: Provided that $250,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of agency administration in program J00H01.01 Transit Administration and $250,000 made for the purpose of departmental administration in program J00A01.01 Execu tive Direction may not be expended until the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) and T he Secretary's Office ( TSO) submit a report to the budget committees on the performance of agency -operated local buses that transport students to local public schools during the 2022-2023 school year. The report shall include: (1) a tabulation of incorrect routing and service delays by severity (length of delay); (2) the number and severity of late school drop- offs; (3) the reasons for service delays on these routes, including bus operator shortages, supervisor shortages, or other issues; and (4) the corrective actions taken or planned to redress these problems. The report shall be submitted by December 1, 2023, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall be canceled if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Many Baltimore City School children are being marked absent from classes due to MTA buses either being late or bus operators failing to drive the correct route.

Specifically, DHS should discuss efforts to fill vacant positions in jurisdictions that had shortfalls in caseworker and supervisor positions, including Baltimore and Prince George's counties, which had the largest shortfalls for caseworker positions among jurisdictions as of September 1, 2022. Additionally, the committees request that DHS provide an update on efforts to fill vacant supervisor and caseworker positions in Baltimore City, which had the greatest number of total vacant supervisor and caseworker positions as of September 1, 2022. In addition to caseload data, the committees also request that the report contain an update on the status of work done by CWLA to implement new workload standards for child welfare and the efforts by DHS to improve recruitment and retention of caseworkers. Information Request Report on caseload data and filled positions assigned by jurisdiction for specified caseload types Author DHS Due Date December 1, 2023 Budget Amendments N00G00.08 Assistance Payments Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: , provided that these funds are to be used only for the purposes herein appropriated, and there shall be no budgetary transfer to any other program or purpose. Funds not expended shall revert to the General Fund. N00G00 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 139 Explanation: This language restricts the general funds appropriated for Assistance Payments, which support public benefit programs administered by the Department of Human Services, to that use only. This restriction prevents a transfer of general funds to other programs. This language is consistent with actions on other entitlement programs. Amend appropriation for the purposes indicated: Funds 1. Reduce funds for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) due to lower anticipated benefit levels. The fiscal 2024 allowance assumes average benefits will increase despite the end of Emergency Allotments, which have increased benefits on average by $170 per month according to the Department of Human Servic es. This reduction still provides funding beyond what is currently expected to be required for SNAP benefits to support program needs if caseloads rise and to provide appropriation if needed for the new federal Summer Electronic Benefit Transfer program an d Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer benefits that may be issued in fiscal 2024. Federal funds not needed to issue benefits for SNAP are not received from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. -100,000,000 FF Total Change -100,000,000 Effect Allowance Appropriation Amount Change General Fund 118,997,860 118,997,860 0 Special Fund 15,601,225 15,601,225 2,367,281,616 -100,000,000 N00G00 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 140 Committee Narrative Application Processing Times, Denials, and Case Closures: The committees remain interested in tracking the timeliness of application processing as well as reasons for denials and case closures.

Because there is no cost to the State, there are concerns that access to tablets or tablet content may be limited in the future if the vendor does not see sufficient profits. Furthermore, premium content is available to inmates at personal cost, which may draw down funds that otherwise would be saved and available t o the offender upon release. The committees request that DPSCS submit a report, due October 15, 2023, on the tablet program.

The report shall include a strategic plan that focuses on identifying and addressing any gaps or deficiencies in training, as well as improving outcomes related to public safety. The strategic plan shall include specific training goals, timelines, and metrics for success and be aligned with recent changes to law enforcement statutes. The report shall summarize all expenditures ma de through the special training fund since establishment, including any planned expenditures for fiscal 2024 and 2025. The report shall include an analysis of how the funding is being used to supplement police training in Maryland and improve outcomes. The report shall be submitted to the budget committees no later than December 1, 2023. The budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be trans ferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall be canceled if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: The Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission (MPTSC) Fund receives $2 million each year through special court fees and was established at the end of fiscal 2019 to provide a dedicated pool of resources to enhance the training of public safety officials in the State. Spending has moderately accelerated since establishment of the MPTSC Fund. Howeve r, the dedicated court fees remain annually underutilized. With the current schedule of spending, the fund balance will grow to $9.4 million by the outset of fiscal 2024. While the growing fund balance builds interest revenues each year, there is still con cern that these dedicated resources remain underutilized. Considering recent changes to police use -of-force standards and the repeal and replacement of the Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights, existing and new officers alike would benefit from training on new laws, policies, and standards.

Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Excessive overtime has become a drain on human resources in the department and led to a riskier work environment for State employees, offenders, and volunteers. The amounts have trended steeply since the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (DPSCS) has struggled to fill correctional officer positions. Assaults are also on the rise, Q00T04 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 166 particularly in detention facilities. There have also been systemic errors in accounting for overtime that led to an ongoing U.S. Department of Labor investigation into unpaid wages. The investigation has already resulted in retroactive payments of $30 million in fiscal 2022 and is anticipated to result in additional retroactive payments. This language restricts overtime funding in the fiscal 2024 budget for the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center until a report is submitted detailing overtime trends, assault patterns, and efforts to reduce overtime.

Because MSB's calculation for formula funding uses four -year average enrollment counts, this error could potentially decrease the school's formula funding through fiscal 2027. The committees request that, by December 1, 2023, MSB report on this issue. This report should include details of MSB's enrollment audit including (1 ) how the school identified and audited enrollment errors; (2) procedures and safeguards to remediate against future errors; and (3) the impact of this error, if any, on the school's formula funding through fiscal 2027.

Explanation: This action amends language modifying the distribution of funding for the Aid to Non- Public Schools Program so that schools where more than 40% of the students are eligible for the free or reduced -price lunch program receive $155 per student. Similar language has been included in the budget since fiscal 2017. It also strikes language regarding the No Child Left Behind Act due to technical differences with the reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act. R00A03 Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 181 Amend the following language to the special fund appropriation: (2) Not charge more tuition to a participating student than the statewide average per pupil expenditure by the local education agencies, as calculated by the department, with appropriate exceptions for special education students as determined by the department ; and (3) Comply with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.; and (4) Submit its student handbook or other written policy related to student admissions to the Maryland State Department of Education for review to ensure compliance with program eligibility requirements.

However, all participating schools must agree that they will not discriminate in student admissions, retention, or expulsion or otherwise discriminate against any student on the basis of race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity or expression. Any school found to be in violation of the requirements to not discriminate shall be required to return to the Maryland State Department of Education all textbooks or computer hardware and software and other electronically delivered learning materials acquired through the fiscal 2023 allocation.

Any school that is found in violation of the nondiscrimination requirements in fiscal 2023 or 2024 may not participate in the program in fiscal 2024. It is the intent of the General Assembly that a school that violates the nondiscrimination requirements is ineligible to participate in the Aid to Non -Public Schools Program, the Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students Today Program, the James E. \"Ed\" DeGrange Nonpublic Aging Schools Program, and the Nonpublic School Sec urity Improvements Program in the year of the violation and the following 2 years.

By focusing on these f aculty, the committees gain a sense of the teaching activities for the regular core faculty. However, there are other types of instructional faculty at institutions, such as full - and part -time nontenured/nontenure -track faculty including adjunct faculty, instructors, and lecturers. Focusing on only tenured/tenure -track faculty provides an incomplete picture of how students are taught. Therefore, the report should also include the instructional workload when all types of faculty are considered. Additional information may be included at the institution's discretion. Furthermore, the USM report should include the percent of faculty meeting or exceeding teaching standards for tenured/tenure -track faculty for the University of Maryland, Baltimore Campus.

Moreover, communities most harmed by cannabis criminalization need access to training to participate i n this emerging sector. The committees are interested in fostering the development of the cannabis industry and request the University System of Maryland (USM), Morgan State University (MSU), St. Mary's College of Maryland (SMCM), and the Maryland Associat ion of Community Colleges (MACC) to establish a workgroup to investigate the development of cannabis focused programs, courses, and certificates to train students for the cannabis industry.

U00A Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 214 Information Request Maryland Used Tire Cleanup and Recycling Fund annual report Author Maryland Department of the Environment Due Date November 1, 2023 Amendment No. Committee Narrative AIR AND RADIATION ADMINISTRATION U00A07.01 Air and Radiation Administration Ambient Air Monitoring Report: The committees are interested in what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State and how this would improve public health. Therefore, the committees request that the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) submit a report on what is needed to deploy an ambient air monitoring network across the State. In addition, the report is requested to include information on how the data collected from a network would mitigate exposure to toxic pollutants, inform permit decision-making processes, and help reduce the cumulative impacts of pollutants such as particulate matter and fine particulate matter.

Information Request Ambient air monitoring report Author MDE Due Date December 31, 2023 Budget Amendments COORDINATING OFFICES U00A10.01 Coordinating Offices Add the following language to the general fund appropriation: , provided that $200,000 $100,000 of this appropriation made for the purpose of general administrative expenses may not be expended until the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE), in cooperation with the Department of Budget and Management, submits a confirmatory letter to the bud get committees indicating that MDE's fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and the fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures are 29 U00A Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 215 budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The confirmatory letter shall be submitted with the fiscal 202 5 budget submission, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the confirmatory letter to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a confirmatory letter may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the confirmatory letter is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: For the second year in a row, MDE's most recent actual fiscal year budget data incorrectly reflects the al location of funding for personnel expenditures. The 2021 Joint Chairmen's Report included committee narrative requesting that the fiscal 2021 budget data be correctly reflected with the fiscal 2023 budget submission. Then, fiscal 2023 budget bill language restricted funding pending the submission of a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2024 budget submission, indicating that prior year actual personnel expenditures up to and including fiscal 2022 are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects. The fringe benefit expenditures - health insurance, pension contributions, and turnover adjustments, among others - are almost entirely reflected as Social Security contributions, which makes it difficult to do historical data comparisons. In addition, MDE budgets in its working appropriation a portion of its personnel expenditures in a subobject used as a temporary placeholder, miscellaneous adjustments, which makes it difficult to compare the working appropriation with the Governor's allowance. Therefore, increased funding is restricted until MDE and the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) submit a confirmatory letter with the fiscal 2025 budget submission indicating that fiscal 2023 actual personnel expenditures and fiscal 2024 working appropriation personnel expenditures are budgeted in the correct statewide subobjects.

The report shall include the following: 30 U00A Senate Budget and Taxation Committee - Operating Budget, March 2023 216 (1) a description of who pays each fee; (2) a description of how the rev enue for each fee is used; (3) whether each fee is recurring or one time; (4) the volume of payors and revenue for each year since each fee was last increased; (5) an explanation for any significant changes in the revenues received from each fee, including, but not limited to, changes in the number of payors or amount paid by each payor; (6) a comparison of Maryland to other peer states in terms of how the functions supported by each fee are handled; (7) the size of each of the special fund shortfalls now and a projection of each of the special fund shortfalls into the future; and (8) an analysis of how much of each of the special fund shortfalls would have been addressed by indexing each fee to inflation. The report shall be submitted by September 29, 2023, and the budget committees shall have 45 days from the date of the receipt of the report to review and comment. Funds restricted pending the receipt of a report may not be transferred by budget amendment or otherwise to any other purpose and shall revert to the General Fund if the report is not submitted to the budget committees. Explanation: Fiscal 2023 general fund deficiency appropriations of $1.5 million are budgeted in each of the Water and Science Administration, the Land and Materials Administration, and the Air and Radiation Administration to counter declining special fund revenue. Th is is the fourth fiscal year in which funding has been provided for declining special fund revenue in at least one of the Maryland Department of the Environment's (MDE) administrations. According to the polluter pays principle, a core tenant of environment al law and environmental economics, social welfare is maximized when all costs - environmental, social, and actual - are reflected in prices. This is not occurring because of outdated fee structures for the special funds supporting the three administration s: Maryland Clean Water Fund; Lead Poisoning Prevention Fund; and Maryland Clean Air Fund. Therefore, this budget bill language restricts funding pending the submission of a report on revised fee structures for the fees supporting these three special fund s by September 29, 2023.
