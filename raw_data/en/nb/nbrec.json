We've gotten many questions on how to reduce symptoms from the vaccine. Often, flu like symptoms can occur as a result of your immune system reacting to what it perceives as a foreign invader. People have reported chills, fever, headaches, body aches as well as the classic sore arm. The good news is that these symptoms are a result of your robust immune system response and that the symptoms are transitory, and last only a day or two in most people. That said, there are some essential self care tools that can make all the difference: Drink twice the amount of water you normally drink the day before and day of your vaccine. Be ready to get extra rest- do not make work or social plans for a day or two afterward. Take an epsom salts bath for 20 minutes or more to reduce aches and pains and resolve chills and headache. Wear comfortable layers to more easily keep your body temperature regulated. Have chicken soup ready- full of nutrients, it will comfort you and help you feel better. Take a natural pain reliever such as homeopathic arnica. Topically it can reduce arm pain at the vaccine site and internally it can reduce headache or body aches. Be aware that if you menstruate, your cycle may be affected by the vaccine. Many report periods coming early, late and having a more heavy, cramp-y flow. We recommend you take magnesium glycinate for cramps 200-400 mg/day. You may also want to apply cotton fabric or a paper towel soaked in castor oil with a hot pack on top to reduce cramping. and smooth the flow.
