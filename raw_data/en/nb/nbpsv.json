Because COVID may continue to be with us for the indefinite future, ISP continues to adapt our policies to support our dual goals of protecting our community and fostering spiritual care and connection. We also recognize that the average risk of hospitalization and death has decreased because of vaccination, immunity due to prior infection, and medical therapies available. As of November 3rd, 2022 we are making the following adaptions to our COVID policy: - ISP no longer requires, but strongly recommends that all members of our community (team members, alumni and participants) be vaccinated and boosted in accordance with current [CDC guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/index.html?s_cid=11759:cdc%20covid%20guidelines:sem.ga:p:RG:GM:gen:PTN:FY22). Recent scientific studies show that keeping up-to-date with COVID vaccines and boosters reduces the risk of severe illness and hospitalization due to COVID, though does not prevent spreading the virus to others. - ISP no longer requires face masks to be worn during retreats or spiritual reflection programs. Wearing masks is always an option for people who feel more comfortable with their use, and our volunteer teams will do our best to have masks available for those interested in wearing them. ISP works closely in partnership with retreat centers, homeless service providers and recovery centers to achieve our mission. As such, ISP volunteers and participants are obligated to follow all the COVID-related requirements set forth by our partner facilities, i.e. retreat centers, shelters, and recovery centers where ISP programs occur. Where there is a conflict of policy, the facility rules take precedence and must be respected and followed. Those with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions or vulnerable family members should consider refraining from participation in ISP programs if they are concerned about becoming infected or infecting others while COVID remains widespread. ISP will continue to monitor the evolving COVID situation and will review and update this policy as needed. ISP team members and community partners are encouraged to contact their Regional Director with any questions or concerns. "}
