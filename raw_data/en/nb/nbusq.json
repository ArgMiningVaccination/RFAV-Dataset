This was under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act ( mgnrega ), which perhaps is the largest social net scheme in the world. Down To Earth reporters, who travelled to different regions of the country, found there was a surge for employment and in many places, the most skilled and educated turned to this programme (see \"619,097\" on p 28). It effectively put a floor to poverty\u2014people got jobs, though unskilled and manual\u2014but it gave them money, albeit only a daily wage, and this provided them the ability to buy food to feed their families. The question is how this massive job creation programme can be worked so that the assets created are du - rable? The programme is providing relief today, but how can it ensure the basis of livelihood security in the future? This is where our focus needs to be. Under this scheme, from April to June, when virus crisis was hitting hard and people were returning to their villages\u2014over 600,000 water-related structures were built or repaired. In other words, people were given employ - ment close to their homes to dig ponds or build check-dams or repair the village tank that was not functional. In the rains that have followed, these water-conservation measures would have played a big role to recharge ground - water and mitigate floods\u2014each pond or tank is the sponge that holds the floodwater for the coming dry period. These then improve agriculture\u2014remember the bulk of India's farms are irrigated not by canal water, but groundwater. So, everything we do to capture the rain where it falls, and everything we do to conserve that water, paves the way for economic growth. The question now is to measure the sustainability of this asset\u2014is it durable? Does it lead to improved water availability? This is equally crucial but as yet, there is little evidence to show that this change is being monitored for its sustainability. According to the government dashboard on mgnrega , between 2017 and 2018 (only one year), 1.3 million works were done in the area of water conser - vation and groundwater recharge. If you add the works on farm ponds\u2014an - other 0.35 million\u2014then we should have created huge capacity for water conservation. Just think of this in another way\u2014simple math. There are some 0.65 million villages in India (2011 Census), and so, if we were to compute, then each village should have at least four water conservation works done in one year itself. Since this is cumulative\u2014new structures are built each year\u2014then over time, we should not have had any water crisis at all! But we do. There is a massive and crippling water shortage in our villages, and lack of drinking water comes at the price of bad health. The government of India has said, rightly so, that its drinking water mission is not about building hardware, but about water in taps. The water in taps in households can only be secured when groundwater recharge is effective and sustainable. This then requires water structures to hold and capture rain. So those millions built under mgnrega must be linked to catchment systems; they need to be functional; and, have to be measured and monitored\u2014not in terms of works, but in terms of assets. This is where the problem still lies. Even today, the scheme only tracks the \"work done\". The Jal Shakti Ministry has said that they will now track progress in terms of water recharge by these structures. This is welcome. This will make the programme go beyond the work of today\u2014important as it is\u2014to build and strength - en the ecological foundations, or the natural capital, for the livelihoods and resilience for tomorrow. What is also important is that the \"nature\" of work has been expanded\u2014from vermicomposting to planting trees. In addition, the government has allowed for \"works\" to be done in private lands for households below the poverty line\u2014even building toilets or septage systems. Between April and August when covid -19 had driven economies to the ground, under mgnrega , 15.5 million individual works were done. This included everything\u2014 from making cattle-sheds and farm ponds to even fencing on lands. Poor people improved their ability to secure their futures and they were paid for this labour. I write this because we are so cynical about these \"labour\" schemes\u2014we say that this is the Keynesian way of digging holes and roads that get washed away every season. It is unproductive labour. Then there are those who would dismiss this as another corrupt scheme that adds to the patronage of the locally-elected elites. But, let's also consider the opportunity that this right to work programme presents, not just in covid -19 times, but for times to come. But this means that the \"right to work\" must be transformed into \"right to livelihoods\".

Since land and resources are limited, there is no doubt that our enormous population growth will one day eclipse whatever economic gains the country makes. Considering the enormity of the calamity creeping upon us, demographers have contended that the population needs to be contained. However, it is unfortunate that some of the state govern - ments are complacent and not doing enough. The southern states, on the other hand, are able to maintain a stable population. It is time our govern - ment, in coordination with the planners, prepares a plan, actively involving every section of the people. This is in our own interest and also in the interest of the nation and future generations. K R SRINIVASAN SECUND\u00c8RABADCOVID-19: We need to improve our prevention strategies This is in reference to the article \"Bihar doctors worried as more healthcare workers fall prey to COVID-19\", published online on July 7, 2020. The struggle against COVID-19 is everywhere, with all segments of the population doing their bit to fight the virus. The medical remedial measures too are in full swing. Still, COVID-19 cases are on the rise. This is an indication that something some - where has gone wrong. This is not to question the efforts of medical and paramedical teams. But the preventive measures need to be streamlined further and fine-tuned. In the unlocking period, when markets open, the public goes out to buy vegetables, fish or grocery, but without taking enough precautions. Several people can be seen without masks. Several who do wear them do not cover the mouth and nose properly. Some just leave their masks hanging as necklaces, while some use handkerchiefs, which is not correct. This disregard for precaution is a reason for the spread of the virus. The police should check the defaulters and penalise them. These markets should be scanned by drones guided from the central police control room for immediate and on-the-spot action. Such steps are likely to reduce the pressure on our medi - cal professionals and hospitals. The government cannot designate one police officer per citizen for monitoring. We need to be perfect in our preventive measures because even small lapses can lead to huge damages.

Amid the distressing reports of COVID-19 pandemic from all corners of the country, the news of Uttarakhand's success in conserving germplasm and publishing a report on the conservation of endemic and threatened floras comes like a breath of fresh air. It is heartening that some of the conserved floras under this report include rare and so-called mythological species like brahmkamal and the sanjeevani herb. No doubt the report will go a long way to serve as one of the largest repositories of conserved plant species and encourage future research in this area. Taking a cue from the report, the state govern - ment needs to channelise its efforts to minimise the extinction rate of endemic plant species and implement strict policing norms to curb their smuggling/illegal extraction.

They have now returned to Delhi after spending four months at home without work, but feel more insecure and uncertain than before. Though the national capital is limping back to normalcy, there is no provision for the healthcare and livelihood security of migrant workers who are its lifeline.WHAT'S INSIDE VIKAS CHOUDHARY 1,000 WORDS BACK TO CONTENT FOR MORE, CLICKMore action than words IN APRIL , the Sonbhadra district administration in Uttar Pradesh announced that people without ration cards can also avail the services of Public Distribution System shops during the last few days of each month. Instead of helping, this triggered black marketing as shopkeepers started giving less to people with ration cards throughout the month to sell the non-ration card households food articles at a premium. \"When I heard this, I borrowed a weighing machine used in hospitals for infants and confronted two shopkeepers at Badhuari panchayat. Instead of being apologetic, they called up local authorities to complain about me, \" recalls Rajesh Choubey, director of Sonbhadra Vikas Samiti. Eventually, the local administration carried out a probe and the erring shopkeepers were disqualified, he adds. \"We carried out similar campaigns in two more villages. Now, pilferage is non- existent in ration shops across the 28 villages in the district. \" The district has a unique geographical location as it shares borders with five states. This is the reason almost all households have family members working outside the state, and when the lockdown was imposed, the district witnessed unprecedented influx. Choubey approached the local administration to get immediate passes for volunteers and started providing free food and medicines to the returning population, mostly sick after the arduous journey back home. \"We all have read a lot about the painful migration during India's Independence. I think what we saw this lockdown was worse. Families returned home only to realise their relatives reluctant to accept them. In the 28 villages we work, we could see people sleeping under trees, by the roadside and other public places, \" says Choubey. Women and children were the worst hit. This was handled by two immediate responses: sensitising people through wall paintings with information on the disease and popularising the use of mask and handwash. The team was in contact with the local child protection committee. They also set up community kitchen facilities at the panchayat level. The crisis deepened after the lockdown measures were relaxed and people started desperately looking for jobs. Choubey and other volunteers assisted people to get enrolled under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act that promises 100 days of assured work to every household in a year. In total, 1,740 job cards have been issued in the villages. His other concern is that most children hit by migration will soon forget how to read and write if they do not resume studies soon. \"While the government is popula- rising online education, most families do not have smart phones. Internet cost is an additional challenge,\" he says. The volunteers are currently trying to procure second-hand books and distribute it among children to plug the problem.Rajesh Choubey has stopped ration shops from pilfering, sensitised people and assisted them in finding livelihood during the pandemic RAJIT SENGUPTA RELATED STORYDigest /IN FRONT-COVID WARRIORBACK TO CONTENTRaghu Murtugudde, a climate scientist at the University of Maryland, US, tells Down To Earth about the impact the developing La Ni\u00f1a condition can have on India Will La Ni\u00f1a impact India's ongoing monsoon season? El Ni\u00f1o tends to produce a weaker monsoon. La Ni\u00f1a tends to do the opposite. Considering the monsoon is below normal along much of the west coast and central India, La Ni\u00f1a could produce more rain during the rest of August and into September. The interannual variability of monsoon, in fact, tends to be the largest in September, so La Ni\u00f1a may produce a wetter September and a delayed withdrawal if it grows stronger. Will it also affect the winter season? A La Ni\u00f1a can affect India's winter. The winds during the winter are from the northeast near the surface and this is accompanied by a southwesterly jet in the upper atmosphere. During El Ni\u00f1o this jet is pushed southward which allows more western disturbance to bring rain and snow into northwestern India. But a La Ni\u00f1a produces a more north-south low pressure system which brings in Siberian air and the cold wave can extend much further south. During some years we have had frost in Mahabaleshwar and cold waves in Tamil Nadu hills and so on due to La Ni\u00f1a. THERE IS over 50 per cent chance of a La Ni\u00f1a condition in the equatorial Pacific Ocean during the autumn of 2020, suggests the latest update by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It adds that once formed, the La Ni\u00f1a condition might continue into the winter season. Currently, El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), an irregularly periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, is in neutral condition. The warming phase of ENSO cycle is known as El Ni\u00f1o and its cooling phase as La Ni\u00f1a. It is characterised by the unusual cooling of the central and east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean. During the past four weeks, equatorial sea surface temperatures were below average from the International Date Line to the eastern Pacific and were above average in the western Pacific. The International Date Line is an imaginary line on the Earth's surface, defining the boundary between one day and the next. Both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a are deviations from normal surface temperatures that occur due to the anomalous behaviour of trade winds. In the case of El Ni\u00f1o, the trade winds weaken, leading to warming. In La Ni\u00f1a, the opposite happens and the trade winds strengthen, leading to cooling. Both these events can have large-scale impacts not only on ocean processes, but also on global weather and climate. During El Ni\u00f1o, the central and equatorial Pacific Ocean becomes unusually warm. This disrupts global wind patterns, affecting climatic conditions in tropical areas like Africa, sub-tropical areas like India and extra-tropical areas like North America. El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a episodes typically last nine to 12 months, but some may last for years. While their frequency can be quite irregular, on an average El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a occur every two to seven years. Typically, El Ni\u00f1o occurs more frequently than La Ni\u00f1a. Expect a late monsoon withdrawal due to La Ni\u00f1a AKSHIT SANGOMLA 'IT CAN IMPACT INDIA'S MONSOONS AND WINTERS' QUERY\\Digest BACK TO CONTENT12 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INDigest /SNAPSHOT THE GOVERNMENT recently released the Swachh Survekshan 2020 report, with much fanfare. The report, however, highlights a peculiar problem: only 35 per cent cities are segregating waste at source in at least 50 per cent of its wards. This percentage is substantially lower than what the government has so far maintained. The Output Outcome Framework 2020-21, released in February by the Union Ministry of Finance to suggest expenditure reforms, observes 74 per cent wards in the country were on track to follow 100 per cent source segregation by March 2020 . It says that under Swachh Bharat Mission -Urban, the country has achieved 100 per cent source segregation in 63,000 of the 82,000 wards in the country. In contrast, the Survekshan report, which has covered 4,242 cities that have a combined ward strength of 64,315, claims only 1,476 cities are segregating at least 50 per cent waste at source. The survey was conducted in January 2020 and the finance ministry report takes data till March 31, 2020. So for both the reports to be correct, the country must have Only 35% cities partially segregate waste at source added nearly 40,000 more wards to the segregation at source list in just three months. The Survek - shan report does not divulge city-wise details on source segregation. Similarly, it claims that 2,606 cities practise door-to-door gar - bage collection in more than 50 per cent of the wards, whereas the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban dashboard, accessed on August 21, claims 4,372 cities (that cover 81,875 wards) are practising 100 per cent door-to-door garbage col - lection. This also seems extremely ambitious and unlikely. The Survekshan report has once again declared Indore as the cleanest city, followed by Surat and Navi Mumbai among cities with more than a million population. Maharashtra's Karad, Saswad and Lonavala bagged the first three positions for cities with population less than 100,000. Among the cities with population between 100,000 and 1 million, Chhattisgarh's Ambikapur was declared the cleanest, followed by Mysore in Karnataka. Chhattis - garh is the first and the only state where every city has achieved open defecation free++ status. CALIFORNIA'S DEATH Valley registered a temperature of 54.4\u00ba C on August 16. Once verified, this could be the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth. The temperature was recorded at the United States National Weather Service's automated weather station at Furnace Creek, near the border with Nevada, at 3:41pm local time. The high temperature is the result of a heat dome that is smothering the US west coast. H eat dome is a high pressure circulation that traps hot ocean air at the surface leading to a heat wave . PUMAS, ALSO known as mountain lions or cougars, have an ability to assess their surrounding terrain and accordingly use a suitable walking gait to conserve energy, says a study by the Queen's University Belfast, UK. The cats travel more slowly while ascending or descending the mountains to conserve energy. This is important as many top predators were moving into what it termed \"energetically challenging environments\" as the areas they usually inhabited were being occupied by humans. Even a relatively shallow incline of 6.8\u00ba increased the pumas' energy use by over 40 per cent. It also found that pumas traversed hillsides to decrease the angle that they climb, thus conserving their energy. BITS BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 13 Arctic Ocean now looks more like the Pacific FROM MORE algae blooms to increased salinity, the Arctic Ocean is undergoing a sea change. A study by scientists at the Stanford University has found that there has been a significant increase in algae blooms in the ocean. They say the primary production (the creation of energy through photosynthesis by algae that forms the base of the food chain) of the Arctic has increased by 57 per cent between 1998 and 2018. This is happening as more nutrients now flow into the ocean and the algae are absorbing more atmospheric carbon, say the scientists in Science. However, this productivity varies across the ocean, says another study, published in Frontiers in Marine Science. Warm water from the peripheral seas are flowing into the Arctic, influencing its temperature, chemical and biological parameters. The mixing of saltwater with freshwater is more on the European side of the Arctic where warmer Atlantic waters are flowing in. This is enhancing biological productivity. In the American-Asian side, the Arctic is getting more freshwater from ice melt and river outflow, which reduces the mixing and thus the productivity.

The friends agreed and decided to return home and rejuvenate their farms lying unused. By April, Rawat and his friends were together growing beans, tomatoes, cabbage, capsicum and brinjal in 0.4 ha. They have also planted pulses and paddy. All of them are confident to earn as much as they did in the city. Rawat has already sold 3 quintals of beans at ` 40 per kg. Tomatoes, cabbage and capsicum are ripening now. He hopes to fetch a good price for these too. The input cost is also quite low as they use cow dung bought from neighbours as manure, not urea. RETURN TO THE HILLS FOR GREENER PASTURES Rawat is among the 330,000 residents who returned to the state after the lockdown. Data with the Uttarakhand Rural Development and Migration Commission ( urdmc ) shows that while 80.68 per cent people returned to Uttarakhand from other states, 18.11 per cent came back from other districts of the state, and 0.92 per cent of the migration was within the district. The percentage of those who returned from abroad was 0.29. urdmc 's two-phase survey collected data on the number of people who returned from February 1 to March 1, and from April 1 to June 21.

He has removed shrubs from his field and sowed vegetables there. For now, he works under the Mahatma Gandhi National Ru-ral Employment Guarantee Act ( mgnrega ). \"It is better to be in the village considering the situation in cities after the pandemic,\" says Bimla's son Durgesh Juyal, who worked in a construction company in Gurugram. But he is apprehensive about his family's future. His schoolgoing daughter had started attending online classes after the lockdown. Here, getting education is difficult. The nearest school is 5 km away and there is no public conveyance. Due to the hilly terrain it takes an hour-and-a-half to reach school and about three hours to return. \"Also, there is no work for me here. What will I do?\" he wonders. But 28-year-old Kishan Dev Singh Katyal, who returned to his village Bonga in Pauri's Kaljikhal block, is optimistic. He had to leave Delhi after Bausch & Lomb, the multinational he worked with, asked him to resign. He was among the hundred employees told to quit. The company was already hit by the economic downturn, but the pandemic was crushing. Katyal now plans to grow mangoes and lychees in his 0.4 ha. \"Land is so fertile here that farming can be really profitable,\" he says. The problem is that Katyal has nothing apart from his ancestral land. To sustain himself, he has started working under mgnrega digging pits and picking up stones. He hopes to get government help to start the business. CAN THE GOVERNMENT HOLD PEOPLE BACK? The Uttarakhand government is determined not to let its people flee again, says Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, (see '45 per cent of our people will stay back', p 18). \"We have launched schemes one after another to turn this disaster into an opportunity,\" he told dte. Under the Mukhyamantri Swarozgar Yojana, people will get 15 to 25 per cent subsidy to start business, be it in manufacturing, agriculture, horticulture or animal husbandry.

What have you done to ensure that those who returned do not go back? Soon after our government was formed, we created the Rural Development and Migration Commission. Its job is to study reasons for migration, how it can be stopped and also recommend ways to generate employment. The fact that several parts of Uttarakhand share India's international border makes it crucial that people live here. This is for the country's safety else a Kargil-like situation may emerge. This is why the migration commission has been asked to do a detailed study\u2014not just study reasons for the migration, but also collect information on the facilities provided in villages and what more people want. Till now, the commission has thoroughly studied five to six districts where each village has been properly examined. Chief Minister's Frontier Area Development Fund announced recently ensures that people living in border areas find employment in their village. Many more schemes have been announced for the migrants after the pandemic. How many people do you think will not go to the cities again? We conducted a sample survey which revealed that about 45 per cent people want to go to big cities again. The students who returned will also go. About 45 per cent of the people will stay. Down To Earth (DTE) visited some villages in Pauri and found the employment schemes had not reached people. What is the government doing about this?Trivendra Singh Rawat , the chief minister of Uttarakhand, tells Down To Earth how his government is convincing people that it is not impossible to rebuild life in the hills BACK TO CONTENTkept `15 crore for this scheme, he says. This apart, districts would spend 40 per cent of their budget on helping people start entrepreneurial projects. Under the Solar Self-Employment Scheme, people have been invited to set up 25-KW solar plants, he says. The government aims to employ 10,000 people under this. \"We are also targeting 10,000 people to start bike taxi service at tourist spots. Youth will get loans to buy bikes and the government will pay interest on the loan for two years,\" he says. Though many schemes have been launched, people are not aware about them, says Katyal. The few who do, are frustrated by lengthy paperwork. A cooperative bank employee who did not wish to be named told dte, \"When people come to our bank to enquire about schemes, they are told to first open an account and deposit 20 per cent of the loan they seek. This means, if they want ` 5 lakh loan, they first have to deposit `1 lakh. So most people return disappointed. This apart, the borrower must have a government employee as guarantor. Who will guarantee anything during the pandemic?\" But considering that migration is not new to Uttarakhand, why does the state not have a working employment generation plan ready? THE CURSE OF MIGRATION: DECADES OLD STORY Uttarakhand is the second state after Uttar Pradesh to have witnessed large-scale and rapid migration, states the Economic Survey 2016-17 . Interestingly, 35 per cent of the migrations happened after 2000, when the state was formed, says Integrated Mountain Initiative ( imi), a Delhi-based non-profit in its report \"State of the Himalayan Farmers and Farming\". While 246 people migrated daily, as per imi, 50.16 per cent of the migrations occurred due to no jobs, 15.21 per cent due to lack of education facilities and 8.83 per cent due to absence of medical facilities, says the Economic Survey 2019-20 . There were 5.61 per cent farmers who fled in distress as animals such as monkeys and pigs would regularly invade their farms and destroy standing crops. \"Farming has never been easy in the hills,\" says Umacharan Baratwal, former member of We have been informed about this and have, therefore, formed a committee to review and inspect the schemes that we announced after the pandemic. Actually, these are all absolutely new schemes and the youth are unable to understand them. Also, people are still in two minds whether to stay back in their village or return to cities. But the government is making all possible efforts to convince them to stay, and I am sure we will succeed. DTE witnessed youths who had returned were farming with great enthusiasm, but they did not get any government support. The government has to first make policies before starting any work. Policies have been made and good results are already showing. At several places, youths have got together to do pisciculture. Some are rearing chicken and goat. The government is providing interest-free loan up to `3 lakh for polyhouse farming. There is a demand to link agriculture with Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA). Has anything been done on this? mgnrega has been very effective in Uttarakhand. But it does not have provision for short-term works. We have requested the Centre to include short-term works and hope it will agree. A big concern is that even if people start working in the state again, not much will be gained as residents do not have the purchasing power. What is the government doing to increase residents' income? Uttarakhand's products are in great demand across the country, but the state must produce in bulk to meet the requirement. The problem is that the farming sector is not organised. We are trying to bring farmers together through cooperatives and are funding those. As products of small farmers reach the market, the income of each family will increase, and so their purchasing power will also increase. BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 19 ANALYSIS /UTTARAKHANDPauri block development committee. Because of the terrain, holdings are small and each farm is located at a distance from the other. Also, farmers have to completely depend on rains because irrigation is not possible in the hills. There is also the threat of less or excessive rainfall which ruin crops. A sample survey done by Rajendra P Mamgain, professor at the S R Sankaran Chair (rural labour), National Institute of Rural Development and Panchayati Raj, is not encouraging. \"In April, I spoke to over 90 migrants. Ninety per cent of them said they would prefer going back to the city because they were sure that earnings in village would not be even 50 per cent of that in the city,\" he says. Ratan Singh Aswal, coordinator of the non-profit Palayan Ek Chintan, agrees. \"We visited 10 districts and found that those willing to stay are still young and unmarried. Most people have families. They do not see monetary benefit in staying back,\" he says. What the government needs to do now is include horticulture and agriculture works in mgnrega , says Rajendra Kukasal, senior advisor (agriculture and horticul-ture), Uttarakhand Integrated Livelihood Support Project. \"People should be guaranteed 200 days work and given ` 300 as daily wage. This apart, youth who do not find work for 15 days should get unemployment allowance,\" he says. Anoop Nautiyal, founder of Social Development for Communities Founda-tion, a Dehradun-based research organi-sation, says, \"The government should launch schemes keeping in mind that the people of Uttarakhand feel safer in salaried jobs as they lack entrepreneurial spirit.\" The government must first reassure people that self-employment can be profitable. What's interesting is that apart from the residents of Uttarakhand, a large number of people have started pouring in from Nepal and Bihar to do agricultural labour, says Namrata Rawat, imi program- me coordinator. Now, people have started spreading awareness so that farmers grow those crops which animals do not relish, like turmeric, ginger and cannabis. Such efforts are necessary, especially for people like Katyal who are determined to stay. \"The economic downturn and the pandemic has taught us that it is not safe to work in the cities. It will take time, but I know I will succeed,\" says Kaytal with his jaws clenched.

She adds that for many children, the food served at anganwadi centres is the only nutritious and filling meal of the day. Yet the lockdown has meant that none of the women self-help groups responsible for running these rural child care have served food in the past five months. The damage such disruptions can cause is scary. It can, for example, make millions of children malnourished, says a paper published in the Journal of Global Health Science . In Jharkhand alone, 0.35 million children can become severely malnourished and another 0.36 million underweight, warns the paper, \"Living on the edge? Anganwadis in most states have stopped operating since April PHOTOGRAPH: SRIKANT CHAUDHARY / CSERELATED STORYBACK EART 1-15 SEPTEMBER 20200 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INYour research says there are children who are just on the threshold of malnutrition. Do you think we need fresh data on their population? At this point we have data on height/weight measures of children provided by the 2016 National Family Health Survey (NFHS ). So, an immediate rapid assessment of nutritional status is needed. What we try and show here is that while conventional outcomes of nutritional failures are based on dichotomised classification, they fail to capture the magnitude of children marginally above/below the cut-off point, and how small shocks can tip a child into a \"clinically\" deprived state. We exemplified using the older NFHS data but the real situation might be more grim if the health, economic and food system impact is severe. Similar issue applies for severely malnourished children as well. Therefore, at policy level, it is crucial to take cognisance of these children through rapid surveys and assessment while targeting interventions. Will the current COVID -19 crisis and the lockdown make these children more vulnerable? The vulnerability among the children (around the threshold) from poorest households is definitely much higher in the current times of distress, particularly after the sudden slump in all economic activities (mainly labour oriented) due to the abrupt lockdown policy response. It is not at all clear whether the national lockdown strategy was effective even in containing COVID -19. But it is clear that as a society we will be paying a considerable cost\u2014in lives (mostly lives of the vulnerable and children)\u2014as consequence of the strategy we adopted. The lockdown may have led to the sudden halt in all public health and nutrition interventions, mainly mid-day school meals or hot cooked meals at anganwadi centres, other supplementary nutrition programmes under ICDS ( Integrated Child Development Services); which we are sure many families in the countries would have come to rely on. Clearly, children from those households, who barely survive at subsistence level even in normal days, will have an adverse impact on their usual dietary intake and therefore bodyweight. Services are being resumed but it may take a while to re-attain the pre-lockdown levels. But, generally speaking, it may be noted that these children are at an elevated risk in normal times as well. In this regard, as mentioned in the study, we would like to stress on the fact that magnitude of the concentration of such children (around standard cut-off) is determined by the usual dietary intake, dietary diversity, socioeconomic environment, maternal health and nutrition status, and coverage of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition- related interventions. So, in normal times as well, it is critical to focus on these children while targeting interventions. At this stage we need to launch an equally passionate strategy of containing and mitigating problems such as undernutrition that has become far more acute as a consequence of the lockdown. Both cash transfers and in-kind transfers may be necessary in substantial measure. Will India undo the progress it has made in the past decade or so in eradicating malnutrition due to the current crisis? During the past few months several media reports are emerging that highlight the food and nutrition related challenges, particularly among the poor. Given the situation, even a slight loss (as little as 0.5 per cent) in body weight among poorest children due to lockdown-induced disruptions will undo the gains. Indeed, in the past couple of years, there was a palpable and real policy momentum in India to improve child nutrition status at political as well as administrative levels. A number of behavioural interventions under POSHAN Abhiyaan such as Village and Health Nutrition Day must have experienced a setback. More importantly, diet-related shocks and even a temporary pause in delivery nutrition interventions to pregnant women from poor households will further intensify the problem of nutritional failures among new-borns and children in the first 1,000 days.\"India needs urgent malnutrition assessment\" WILLIAM JOE, assistant professor at the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi and S V SUBRAMANIAN, professor at the Harvard University, US, have authoured a paper on the risk of malnutrition during COVID-19.

The worry does not end there. Another 0.5 million children in Jharkhand can become wasted, and 0.4 million severe wasted. A child is wasted when s/he has low weight for height. It is triggered either by poor diet or infectious diseases like diarrhoea. Underweight is defined as low weight-for-age. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both. The study has a similar prediction for the rest of the country. It warns the food shock, defined as the disruption in nutritious food due to the lockdown, would be worst felt in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. \"They have the highest child population base along with high levels of poverty head count ratio, maternal mortality, infant mortality and low coverage of public health and nutrition services,\" warn the researchers (see \"India needs urgent malnutrition assessment\" p 26). The three states can record over 5 million new malnourished children due to the lockdown (see 'Hunger strikes' p23). Every second child in India is already malnourished, suggests the latest National Family Health Survey ( nfhs) of 2015-16, which is the basis for the study. It means roughly 77 million children\u2014which is the combined population of Jharkhand, Telangana and Kerala\u2014are undernourished in the country. Using this data, the researchers have ascertained the additional children population that will become malnourished in three distinct scenarios\u2014if children lose 0.5 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 5 per cent of their weight during the lockdown. \"Under a scenario of bodyweight shock of 0.5 per cent, the prevalence of underweight and wasting will increase by 1.42 and 1.36 percentage points, respectively. These estimates get translated into 410,413 and 392,886 additional cases of underweight and wasting, respectively,\" the report says. It estimates that the number of severe underweight and wasted children is expected to increase by 268,767 and 166,342, respec- tively. In a scenario of five per cent weight loss, India will experience a staggering increase of 4.4 million underweight and 3.2 million severe underweight children. It can also make 5,140,936 additional children wasted and 2,129,522 children severe wasted. The researchers explain the numbers by saying that a high concentration of children in the country are already around the undernutrition threshold, and any minor shock to nutritional health of the children can have major implications. Given the challenge in the current scenario, the paper says it is \"critical to ensure an uninterrupted supply of nutritious meals and food supplements to the poor children while arresting the infection spread\". It concludes that it is still a conservative estimate and these minor shocks can lead to large and devastating effects on nutritional health of India.

As always, he is dressed in neatly ironed trousers, shirt and sandals. With a post-graduate degree in psychology, he is among the most qualified youths in the village. The official responds, \"Yes. We are in talks with the irrigation department about cleaning and de-silting a canal and with the Indian Railways about clearing the tracks.\" The news pacifies the crowd, including Ratan, waiting eagerly for more work under the country's largest public wage programme, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, popularly known by its acronym mgnrega . The programme, implemented in 691 of the country's 739 districts, is in fact dubbed the world's largest state-sponsored job-scheme to eradicate poverty. As per its preamble, mgnrega aims to enhance the livelihood security of rural households by guaranteeing them \"100 days of unskilled manual work\" every financial year. At least 75 per cent of the total works must be related to water conservation, the Act mandates. Yet, the rush for mgnrega works at Dhurala panchayat office somehow appears unusual. Well-qualified people like Ratan rarely scout for jobs under the public wage programme. Besides, Johad , a traditional water harvesting structure, recently revived under MGNREGA at Dhurala village in HaryanaBACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 31 Haryana, being an industrial state, has never seen such a huge demand for mgnrega works. Manoj Kumar, additional block programme officer ( abpo), Thanesar block in Kurukshetra, informs that they implemented mgnrega works in Dhurala last year, after a gap of three years, while constructing a community centre. \"Though the programme is demand-based, we had to cajole the residents to take up the work. People here are usually reluctant as most of them are skilled and work in adjoining cities as construction foremen, tailors, drivers, gardeners or teachers.\" Ratan, who has been preparing for the position of assistant professor in state colleges, also worked as a \"Saksham\" teacher\u2014an honorary assignment under the state government's Saksham Yuva Yojana that provides employment to educated unemployed youth\u2014in a government school in Kurukshetra city. But his whole world came crashing down when the state government on March 24 announced the lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus ( covid -19) and the school was temporarily closed. Soon, the Union government extended the lockdown till the end of May, choking his only source of income. Ratan's younger brother too lost his job and was back in the village. It dealt a huge blow to his family of 13, struggling to bear the treatment cost of Ratan's two-year-old daughter, who suffers from a heart ailment, and an elder brother, being treated for psychological illness. That is when Ratan decided to apply for a job card under mgnrega . \"I worked for 40 days and received much more than what I used to earn from teaching,\" he says. Haryana offers ` 309 a day as mgnrega wage, one of the highest in the country. \"I am not sure how we would have survived otherwise.\" The management information system ( mis) maintained by the mgnrega website shows during the four months since the lockdown (April to July), Dhurala generat-ed 5,140 person-days of employment, bene-fitting 226 households. The figures were just 3,630 for the whole of last financial year. In neighbouring Dayalpur village, where only one family demanded wage support last year, 204 availed employment under mgnrega till July this year. Kumar says owing to the surge in demand, the district administration has expanded the coverage of the programme; nine new villages have been added in Thanesar alone. The state follows the trend of Dhurala and Dayalpur. Haryana has budgeted 10 million person-days of employ-ment under mgnrega for the current finan- cial year. During the first four months, it has exhausted almost half of the labour budget by providing wage support to 4.5 million people. There has been a 154 per cent increase in the mgnrega work demand during these months, compared to the corresponding period last year. THIS IS AN UNUSUAL SURGE Demands have not only crossed all records, it has happened during the leanest period The trend in other parts of the country is no different from that witnessed in In April, when COVID-19 lockdown was still on, MGNREGA registered the lowest job demand in five years.

But what has come as a surprise is the unprecedented surge in the demand of mgnrega works in the country during the leanest months of May, June and July. This is the period when people prepare their fields for kharif crops. A majority of people who had migranted also returned home briefly to participate in the farm works. Construction activities under mgnrega also take backseat due to the arrival of monsoon. But covid -19 has upended the trends this year. On an average, 21.5 million households seek works under mgnrega in a month in the country, shows an analysis of the mis data between 2013-14 and 2019-20. In April, when the country was still under covid -19 lockdown, mgnrega registered one of the lowest demands in recent times\u201412.8 million. But the demand curve moved northwards as soon as the government began easing the lockdown measures and those engaged in the urban informal economy returned to their villages (see 'Reclaiming mgnrega ', p31). By May, over 36 million households had registered for work. The demand rose to over 40 million in June\u2014almost double the average demand for the month during the past seven years. A state-wise analysis shows in June, 57 per cent of the demand was generated from the five states that reported the return of a large number of informal- sector workers\u2014Uttar Pradesh (that has received 6.2 million workers), Rajasthan (5.3 million), Andhra Pradesh (4.4 million), Tamil Nadu (4.1 million) and West Bengal (3.5 million). In at least 30 states and Union Territories, more households demanded works in July than the average of the past seven years. Odisha witnessed the sharpest increase of 206 per cent, followed by Bihar (199 per cent), Karnataka (192 per cent), Jammu & Kashmir (182 per cent), Madhya Pradesh (164 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (157 per cent). What could have prompted this unusual surge? Did the rural agrarian economy fail to absorb the surplus labour? A similar surge in mgnrega work demand was witnessed in 2009 when a severe drought gripped large parts of the country. This is believed to have helped the United Progressive Alliance in its re-election that year. Going by the trend so far, mgnrega work demand this year is set to break the 2009 record. Does this mean the May-July surge was propelled by the pandemic-induced unemployment and economic upheaval? There is no clear-cut answer to this. What's clear is that both the authorities and people are working in tandem, probably for the first time in mgnrega 's history, to make the most of it. Districts with high job demands have used this opportunity to create thousands of water conservation works, in letter and spirit.

Due to over-exploitation of groundwater for irrigation, water table in the state has dropped to critically low levels. In Thane- sar block, water table has dropped by almost 22 metres over the past 45 years, shows data with the Central Ground Water Board ( cgwb ). So, in early June, when people started demanding wage support, the block's rural development agency came up with a win-win solution. In Dhurala, it employed people to revive a johad , traditional percolation pond on the village common land, lying abandoned for years. In Dayalpur, where people depend on groundwater for 90 per cent of their irrigation needs, the village pond was desilted and deepened. Both the works were completed before the monsoon arrived. By the end of July, the johad in Dhurala had the capacity to hold 34,000 cubic metres (cu m) of water. Kumar claims that the pond at Dayalpur can harvest and store over 52,000 cu m of rainwater by the end of the monsoon season. It can then be used to irrigate almost one-sixth of the 600 hectares (ha) farmland in the village. The pond at Dayalpur has, in fact, been selected to be developed as a model under a new campaign of the state government to reduce dependence on groundwater by rehabilitating ponds and using them for rainwater harvesting.

In neighbouring Yamunanagar distr- ict, where the demand for works under mgnrega increased by 352 per cent during the four months, the authorities have deployed the workforce to clean and maintain Hathnikund barrage and its network of canals, which divert the Yamuna water for irrigation needs of the district and also to meet the drinking water needs of Delhi. The barrage and its canals were choking over the past five years due to lack of maintenance. \"Usually, the irrigation department hhires contractors who use heavy machineries for desilting the barrage. But for the first time, desilting work has been done manually this year to accommodate the high demand for mgnrega works,\" says Gurnam Singh, abpo of Pratapnagar block in Yamunanagar. In Punjab, which shares the same fate as Haryana in terms of groundwater, rural development minister Tript Rajinder Singh Bajwa too saw an opportunity in the surplus labour capital. In 2019, the state government launched a drive to revive traditional ponds. The aim was to replen- ish and conserve groundwater, which according to the 2019 report of cgwb was being extracted at a rate 165 per cent more than the recharge rate through a stag- gering 1.43 million tube wells. cgwb had Women in Marwon Ka Kheda village in Rajasthan convert wasteland into a farmlandBACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 35 warned that if groundwater continued to be exploited at the current rate, Punjab would become a desert within 25 years. But of the 13,178 targeted ponds, the government could revive only 7,792\u2014dirty water was removed from 5,352 ponds and another 2,440 were de-silted. The works could not be completed last year due to the onset of monsoon. This year, as soon as lockdown restrictions were eased, the government resumed the pond restoration works, but changed the method. \"Last year, most works were done using mechanical dredging,\" says Seema Jain, finance commissioner, rural develop- ment and panchayats department of the state. This year, the government has done away with this provision. Instead, when the project resumed on May 12, those who had lost jobs due to the covid -19 pandemic, were roped in for the works. \"The number of people employed under mgnrega in Punjab was 0.15 million in 2019-20. The figure has gone up to more than 0.22 million in the current financial year (till July),\" says Jain. By mid-June, 11,071 of the 12,296 ponds targeted for this year were dewatered and 3,176 of the 7,456 targeted ponds were desilted. These works generated 1 million person-days of employment under mgnrega . REBRAND, RENEW FOCUS Uttar Pradesh's emphasis on natural resource management offers migrants a choice to stay By early August, Uttar Pradesh received 3.4 million returning migrant workers\u2014the highest in the country. But through a concerted effort it turned the tide in its favour. It set up a commission\u2014the Uttar Pradesh Labour (Employment Exchange and Job) Commission\u2014to ensure their social and economic securities. Its mand- ate is to ensure that these people are gainfully employed, so that they can decide whether to stay or migrate again. It ran a campaign in June to convince the youth that mgnrega works are not \"undignified\" and announced the creation of 10 million person-days of work everyday from June 15 onwards. The strategy paid off. The state reported a three-fold increase in the demand during May-June compared to the corresponding period last year. The success of Uttar Pradesh is clearly palpable in Siddharthnagar, among the country's 250 most backward districts, which adjoins Nepal. Evidently, the district rep- orts high levels of migration\u2014estimates show that almost a quarter of the people from the district migrate to cities in search of menial jobs. Sensing a swell of returning workers following the lockdown, district magistrate Deepak Meena put in place a plan for each of the 1,110 village panchayats in the district. A list was prepared, identifying those who would demand work, their skill and what works should be undertaken. Most village panchayats listed water conservation works like digging new ponds and tanks or renovating them as a priority work. \"In the four months till July, we have utilised 61.4 per cent of the labour budget for the year and created close to 6 million person-days of works by rejuvenating 1,000 ponds and 140 traditional harvesting structures,\" says Pulkit Garg, chief development officer of the district. At least 64 ponds have been dug under mgnrega on private lands. Sanjay Sharma, in-charge of mgnrega in Siddharthnagar district of the state, says, each of the newly dug or renovated ponds have the capacity to irrigate 30 ha. Besides, they will control floods and water logging, which are major threats to agriculture. Altogether, these bodies have added 40 million cu m to the water storage capacity of the district and will benefit 10,000 to 12,000 families. Across the state, some 83 per cent of the 0.7 million works that the government plans to undertake this year under mgnrega are water conservation-related works, such as micro-irrigation, renovation of traditional water bodies and rainwater harvesting structures. Rambraj, a 45-year-old resident of Bhitiya village in Siddharthnagar, is well aware of the Water structure Source:MGNREGATotal water-related structures built during just four months this yearWater-harvesting and related projects are popular this year, compared to TO CONTENTCOVER STORY /MGNREGA36 EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INpotential of a waterbody. Since his return from Surat, where he worked as an ace tailor, he has been digging ponds. These days, he is busy desilting an ancient pond in his village along with 120 others who too have returned from various parts of the country following the lockdown. \"The pond lay in ruins. Now, our future depends on its revival,\" says Rambraj. There has been a clear shift in the works selected under mgnrega this year. In just four months, mgnrega has surpas- sed last year's national records on most of natural resources management ( nrm) related works, which includes soil and water conservation, groundwater recharge, irrigation and drainage related works, plantation and land related works. Between April 2019 and March 2020, some 0.55 million nrm works were undertaken under mgnrega . As many as 0.61 million works have been completed between April and July this year (see 'Emergence of natural capital', p 32). Some of the popular water harvesting structures have been farm ponds and dug wells, which assure irrigation to individual farms. INNOVATION SHOWS WAY Officials eliminate red-tapism, coordinate for more works to accommodate demand Providing immediate wage support to the returning migrant workers and keeping them gainfully employed for months is no easy task. So, in some districts, the authorities have tweaked the programme to speed up the planning process. Usually, the identification of mgnrega work starts bottom up. First, the gram panchayat identifies the works to be undertaken as per the local needs. A plan in this regard is prepared around August 15, and submitted to the district authorities for approval. The district administration, along with the state government, approves the proposals by January-February, and the work starts in April. This process often gets delayed and the works start only around September-October. In Uttar Pradesh's Jalaun district, which falls in the arid Bundelkhand region and is infamous for large-scale migration, changed this process to open up more works. \"Apart from the works carried over from last year, we decided to start the works as soon as the gram panchayats approved it,\" says Jitendra Kumar Saxena, senior assistant, mgnrega . In Moradabad district, officials have widened the scope of works. \"This year, we are considering bigger projects that can generate significant works and accomm- odate more labourers,\" says Dinesh Kumar, additional programme officer for mgnrega in the district. At the same time, officials are trying to rope in other departments that can provide work. One such breakthrough has come from the horticulture department. Explains district horticulture officer Sunil Kumar: \"To promote gardening, the government usually bears 50 per cent per cent of the cost of materials like vermicompost. Now, we are asking people to hire labourers whose cost will be borne by the government under mgnrega .\" In Madhya Pradesh, the district administration of Chhatarpur is promot- ing a kitchen garden, set up by a women self-help group ( shg), under village by roping in 12 women. They removed encroachment from the village wasteland, spanning 1 ha, and using labour funded by mgnrega created a garden. The land, which is now called community nutrition garden, was equally divided among the shg members where they grow vegetables. \"Our priority was to provide seamless supply of nutritious food to people. But it also generated employ- ment,\" says Sanjay Singh, head of psss. After the lockdown, the village saw 400 migrant workers returning to their homes. All of them were first put under quarantine at the village school for about a week. J S Bundela, panchayat secretary of Ragoli, BACK TO CONTENTFostering a Sustainable Community in Mawphlang The Khasi tribe of Mawphlang , near Shillong in Meghalaya, shares a close harmony with nature. When Himalaya first visited Mawphlang , we were inspired by their love for nature and rich heritage. For centuries, they have been preserving the forest lands. But in the recent past, the younger generation has migrated to cities in search of better employment opportunities. Himalaya in association with SYNJUK, a local NGO , is helping Mawphlang turn into a sustainable community. As a first step, we're creating opportunities for the local youth by training them in the traditional methods of livelihood, such as vermicomposting, apiculture, and mushroom cultivation. We have conducted extensive training programs on scientific techniques and live demonstrations by experienced professionals. To kickstart the program, we have provided the necessary resources and equipment and will continue to extend technical support through our on-ground partner. Himalaya organized tree plantation drives and planted close to 30,000 indigenous tree saplings to conserve the biodiversity of the region. We also conducted comprehensive health camps in the region as part of our 'Healthy India, Happy India' campaign and reached out to over 1000 individuals from the villages of Mawphlang and Nongrum . Himalaya is working towards improving the financial condition of the local community in Mawphlang and helping them become self-sufficient.

About 375 kg of tomato, chilli, brinjal, spinach, coriander and bottle guard came from the garden.\" Soon, the demand for works under mgnrega shot up. In Chhatarpur of the state, while the work demand between May and July 2019-20 stood at 26,218, 27,346 and 23,567 households respectively, the same for this year jumped to 37,334, 46,097 and 45,151. As many as 141 people applied for new job cards; some of them have got work at the community nutrition garden. On April 12, on hearing the news of his father's demise, Kishori Lal Kushwaha started his journey from Haryana's Hissar district to Ragoli on foot. It took Kushwaha 20 days to reach home. Once in Ragoli, he was met with a different uncertainty. \"I didn't have a single penny left,\" he said. But fortunately, the community nutrition garden has provided him with work. Along with 12 other people, he is now responsible for maintaining the orchard that has 500 trees. I now receive ` 190 a day under mgnrega ,\" Kushwaha says. \"What we are witnessing now is the real potential of mgnrega . If people's labour is invested on water conservation and agriculture-related activities, the return is very high; in fact, it is higher than the immediate wage,\" says Sanjay. WHEN EVERY SMILE COUNTS Individuals, small groups now join MGNREGA not for immediate relief but as long-term investment To encourage more and more people to join the workfare programme, the focus of mgnrega has shifted to creation of assets that would benefit individuals. This ensured that people, particularly farmers from below the poverty line ( bpl) category, got paid while creating their own assets like cattle shed. One such beneficiary is Javed Khan, a livestock rearer in Pratapnagar's Tajewala village. \"I had a makeshift structure to keep the cattle and would always be under the fear that it would catch fire. Now that the government has built a hygienic and sanitised shed, I hope that milk production from my cows will go up,\" says Khan. In the four months till July, Haryana has completed 784 individual works; at least 200 cattle sheds have been sanctioned in Thanesar block. mis reports available on the mgnrega website show that 336,272 individual works have been taken up during the four months across the country; this is about one-fifth of the total such works done during the whole last year. Of this, 199,820 are under rural housing category, and close to 33 per cent works are for land development, creating infrastructure for livestock and plantation. This is a significant development, given that the creation of individual assets had fallen out of favour after 2017-18. It seems the lockdown and the consequent economic crisis in rural areas have made both people and the government realise the importance of mgnrega . It is a Thursday, an official weekly holiday for mgnrega works in Rajasthan. Yet, some 40 women in Bhilwara district's Marwon trees from a 10-ha land with hardened hillocks. They know they would not be paid for the work done that day. \"But we know what this will result in: a piece of land for agriculture and a future where we don't have to struggle every day for daily wage,\" says Suman Devi, a 58-year-old resident. Once the land is cleared of the invasive trees, they are going to level it and make it cultivable using mgnrega funds, as the government has permitted community cultivation. Then they will split the land into plots for nurseries and vegetable cultivation. They have already identified a pond and a feeder canal for irrigating the land. Though silted up and covered with weeds, the women plan to use mgnrega to first revive the water bodies and then implement drip irrigation system for judicious use of the harvested water. Dry investment Source:MGNREGAof the total utilised budget has been spent on water-related works in the first four months The current financial year's investment on water projects has so far been the lowest DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 39 Across the village, several other households are also working on their own farmland under mgnrega . In total, the village has 19 ongoing works, all related to natural resource management. In Rajasthan, 3.2 million people had demanded works last year. This year, it has increased to 5.2 million in just four months. Following the lockdown, some 0.99 million workers have returned to the state by July end. During the four months post lockdown, the state data shows completion of 4,545 works of which 66 per cent are related to water conservation. \"More than just opening up works, we have made sure that the communities pick up the works they feel can add to their future earnings. And most of them asked for water conservation and land-related works,\" says Gopal Ram Birdha, who supervises mgnrega in Bhilwara. This could be the reason, more and more people, particularly women, have joined the programme this time, he adds. In Ajmer's Meenao Ki Dhani village, first time almost all households have applied for work under mgnrega . Nearly 60 per cent of them are women. When district officials asked them to choose a work, they opted to revive a dry tank, aaw, and its 5-km-long feeder canal that had silted up. Four months later, when the system was revived the entire village gathered around the tank to see the first gush of water into it. It was a rare sight for most in the village. Women would no longer have to walk 2 km a day to fetch drinking water as this tank would recharge the 24 wells In Uttar Pradesh's Jalaun district, officials have fast-tracked the approval process of works to provide immediate relief to people BACK TO CONTENTCOVER STORY /MGNREGA40 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INin the vicinity, which too have dried up in the recent years. Hansraj, a village elder, estimates that the tank with 16,000 cu m storage capacity will offer an assured irrigation to 80 ha of farmland. \"My wheat yield will simply double,\" he says. The focus on using mgnrega for water conservation is definitely yielding results in term of enhanced agriculture and availability irrigation locally. This has economic benefit in long-term. Amit Mathur, mgnrega in-charge of Ajmer, says, \"Getting such works done has helped people in two ways. First, they received cash as an immediate relief. Now, they are using the land and irrigation facilities to grow vegetables, which will offer them regular income.\" During the four months till July, the government has spent about `65 lakh on the works; close to 70 per cent of it went to people as wages. Enthusiasm can be clearly gauged from the completed works. In states like West Bengal that received a large number labourers who had left the state earlier, a huge amount of works have been completed between April and July this year compared to the same period last year. Over 72,000 works related to natural resource management have been completed this year, compared to just 7,000 during the whole of last year. Bihar, another state with a high number of people returning to their state, completed nine times Uttarakhand chief minister wants agricultural activities to be included under the employment scheme to ensure people do not leave their villages againBACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 41 amount of work on nrm, especially on water conservation, is being done under mgnrega during the covid -19 times. On the other hand, availing work under the scheme, individuals can now level their fields, create a farm pond or do vermicomposting, besides 35 other such activities in their own land and be paid wages under the programme. Since 2015, major emphasis has been given to two kinds of works: irrigation facilities and rural sanitation. A study published in 2018 by the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi for 21 selected states says the work related to irrigation facilities increased from 30.6 per cent in 2015-16 to 58.9 per cent in 2017-18. According to the study, it is seen that creation of individual assets also increased from 31 to 48 per cent during 2015-16 to 2017-18. The creation of individual assets in individual lands includes contour bunds more works in the four months of 2020 than in 2019. CASHING IN ON NATURE MGNREGA is an asset transferring programme. This aspect makes it attractive to communities Creation of productive assets, whether for individual or for community benefits, has been the hallmark of mgnrega . Starting with just 29 types of works allowed under the programme at its inception, it now includes some 260 types of works. From the hills to the plains, deserts to flood-prone areas, and from the uplands to coastal areas, rural residents are paid for development works like deepening of ponds, creating shelter for livestock, or clearing a silted spring in the hills. All this on one condition: people have to demand jobs under the programme. Addition of new types of work over a period has been made to upgrade the list, so that it reflects people's needs critical to their livelihood like farming, fishery and livestock rearing. But over the years, the works related to natural resource management had taken a backseat. Take the example of water-related structures, which are common village assets. Between 2006-07 and 2019-20, more than 10 million such structures have been built under mgnrega at an expense of not less than ` 201,000 crore. But the fact is the number of water-related projects under mgnrega and associated expenditure had declined over last five years. Between 2014-15 and 2019-20, it has been seen that on an average 35.14 per cent of the money is spent on water related works in comparison to the expenditure on the total works under mgnrega . This is when the Act mandates that at least 75 per cent of the total works must be related to water conservation. But this year, in the four months bet- ween April and July, people have comple-ted 60 per cent of the water conservations works undertaken during the whole of 2019-20. There is no doubt that a huge Source:MGNREGAShare of works completed in the first four months of 2020-21 over entire 2019-20Individual assets created in the first four months of 2020-21 is already 16 per cent of the total individual assets built in 2019-20Putting house in order For improving land productivity Plantation related works Rural housing and related works Infrastructure for livestock promotion31,471 89,200 199,820 15,781APRIL - JUNE 2020APRIL - % 226,493 1,574,378 BACK TO CONTENTCOVER STORY /MGNREGA42 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INand farm ponds apart from vermicomp- osting and cattle shed. In 2010-11 the demand for works under the programme showed consistent dip. One of the reasons was that people were losing incentive for joining the programme. So, the government allowed several works with private benefits under the programme. It has not only led to an increase in job demand but also a boom in asset creation for individuals. Since 2015- 16 till 2019-20, some 1.83 million farm ponds have been created. These water harvesting structures benefit individual farmers. Given that a typical farm pond holds 1,200 cu m of water, farmers have already created storage of 2,201 million cu m. A 2016 study by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics ( icrisat ) shows that there was a huge increase in groundwater recharge due to the mgnrega work done in the three water-scarce states of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. The net irrigated area also increased between 5 and 95 ha. The water harvesting structures have increased the yield of the bore wells and reduced soil erosion. Economic gains are also well observed in certain districts. For example, after creating rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge under mgnrega , farmers in Abhaypur panchayat of Rajasthan have now shifted to growing wheat in place of mustard as practised in earlier days. This has doubled the net income of farmers to ` 50,000 per ha. In one way, mgnrega is an asset transferring programme. This makes it attractive to local communities, and also adds to the income-generating activities. Several officials in-charge of mgnrega are demanding to include more works related to natural resource management in mgnrega . \"Agriculture is the dominant occupation in eastern Uttar Pradesh. There are many jobs related to farming here. All such works should be included in mgnrega . This will not only improve the situation of agriculture but can also be a permanent solution to unemployment,\" says Sanjay Sharma, who has successfully implemented the programme in Siddharthnagar. There is a political d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu around mgnrega . After coming to power in 2014, and in his first speech in Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had termed mgnrega as a upa government's \"monumental failure\". Modi junked the programme as an affront to Indians' dignity as it let them dig tanks and ponds. Soon after the labour crisis went out of control due to job loss under lockdown, Modi made mgnrega the centrepiece of his relief package for rural India. This year the Union government has budgeted ` 1.20 lakh crore for the public wage programme, including an additional allocation of `40,000 crore in July. All states, barring Delhi and Union Territories, have made special provisions under mgnrega to create employment for returning workers. They are using the programme as the sole vehicle to tide over the crisis of unemployment in rural areas. At present, the political leadership is using the programme as a tool to tide over the crisis created by the pandemic. Trivendra Singh Rawat, chief minister of Uttarakhand, where several villages now lie deserted due to mass exodus of people from rural areas, feels that the programme can play a critical role in reviving the state's rural economy. Following the lockdown, the state has seen a wave of reverse migration for the first time in years. Rawat, who wants these people to stay, pins his hope on mgnrega . People should be allowed to work on their own fields under mgnrega , he demands. That means paying people to help them once again take up their primary occupation, which is agriculture. This is what the programme is already doing. It may be the inadvertent fallout of the pandemic; but it's a new understanding of mgnrega .

Chances are that this march won't stop even when the outbreak ceases. A poor infrastructure to deal with covid -19 and unplanned entries and exits into and from lockdowns may end up prolonging the pain. According to a report released by the State Bank of India on August 17, states, on an average, will see a 16.8 per cent drop in their gross domestic product ( gdp) in 2020-21 (FY21). It adds that even a 10 per cent reduction is enough to push the mortality rate in the states by 0.6-3.6 per cent. In Uttar Pradesh, for instance, covid -19 deaths alone will increase the state's overall mortality rate by 0.16 per cent, whereas the state gdp contraction will push the mortality rate by a further 3.4 per cent, which is more than half of the state's current mortality rate. Similarly, Delhi will add 2.42 per cent to the existing mortality rate. Of this, 2.14 per cent will be COVID-19 /UPDATE 44 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SPETEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INadded due to gdp contraction. The country's gdp loss will be to the tune of ` 38 lakh crore in the current financial year. The top 10 states will be responsible for some 73.8 per cent of the total gdp loss. They currently account for nearly 81 per cent of total confirmed covid -19 cases. This will translate to a per capita annual income loss of ` 27,000. While Maharashtra will contribute 14 per cent of the country's total gdp loss, Goa will witness the maximum per capita loss of over ` 1,00,000. In Delhi, the per capita loss will be close to ` 90,000. POOR PREPAREDNESS In April, when India imposed the nationwide lockdown, it was applauded globally for early measures. Five months on, the country is witnessing the fastest growth of covid -19 cases in the world. Between July 30 and Auust 13, it has reported more than 1 million new cases, with a daily average of 58,000 new cases. India's current doubling rate is about 22 days, at par with Argentina and the US. The world average is 43 days. The country also has the highest death per million rate among major Asian economies. In contrast, Ethiopia, which introduced a lockdown at the same time as India, has already flattened the curve and achieved it at a much lower economic cost than that of India. The difference lies in the fact that Ethiopia ensured coherent response by maximising coordination among public agencies at different levels. India, in contrast, has been more volatile and leading to non-calibrated exits from lockdown. In fact, states have resorted to \"unplanned and unsystematic lockdowns\" that are adversely impacting the economic activity. Of the 18 states analysed in the sbi report, Karnataka has the highest number of isolation beds per 100,000 population at 298. The average of the states is just 80 beds. This is alarming on two counts: one, India is nowhere near flattening the curve, and two, the disease has spread significantly to rural India. NO END IN SIGHT While only five states in the country have witnessed the peak (Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, and Tripura), 22 are yet to go downhill on the curve. Global experiences suggest that a region can have multiple peaks. According to the World Health Organization, before a region can relax restrictions or begin reopening, the test positivity rate from a comprehensive testing programme should be at or below 5 per cent for at least 14 days. While 18 states, including Uttar Pradesh, fall in this category, the testing rate remains far from satisfactory in most of them. An analysis of positivity rate\u2014how prevalent positive cases of the disease are, when compared to the number of tests being done\u2014and tests per million indicates that in most states, including Maharashtra, Telangana, Bihar and West Bengal, the positivity rate is significantly high but tests per million are quite less. This indicates that in these states the peak is yet come and the situation will remain grave till the time the number of tests increases significantly. RURAL IS THE NEW HOTSPOT Rural districts, defined as areas where rural population is more than 60 per cent as per Census 2011, contributed 54 per cent of new cases in the first half of August. In July the contribution was 51 per cent. In June, the rural share was 24 per cent. Of the 50 districts that contributed most new cases in August, Andhra Pradesh comes at the top with 13 districts, of which 11 are rural. Maharashtra has 12 of the 50 districts, of which six are rural. Also, the number of rural districts with less than 10 cases has reduced significantly. In April, India had 415 rural districts with less than 10 confirmed cases. By the first half of August, only 14 such districts remain.

They are sticklers for the law and by no stretch of the imagination can they be activists. Oh, no. Why then were 34 of them, cutting across party lines, writing to the highest health officials of the country to override Gilead's patents on remdesivir, the most hyped drug in the world? It is an unusual step for state AGs to take, and possibly the first time so many of them have come together in a bipartisan effort. But then the covid -19 pandemic has resulted in an unprecedented situation, with the US ravaged more than any other country. The law officials have urged the federal government to exercise its march-in-rights against Gilead to ensure that Americans can access sufficient supplies of remdesivir during this pandemic and at affordable prices. Remdesivir, which earlier received emergency use authorisation to treat covid -19 patients, is said to cut a patient's hospital stay by five days. But as Gilead announced its exorbitant rates for the drug, there has been a widespread campaign to rein in the US multinational which has received over $70 million in public funds to develop remdesivir. The AGs have joined in by accusing Gilead of neither setting a reasonable price nor meeting the health and safety needs of the public during the pandemic. They have written to Health Secretary Alex M Azar urging the federal government to use its march-in-rights to help increase the \"dangerously low supply\" of this drug and lower the price so that it is accessible to the residents of their 34 states. If not, he should support these states by assigning them the rights through the National Institutes of Health ( nih) and Food & Drug Administration. March-in-rights were created in 1980 by the Bayh-Dole Act which aimed at ensuring that the results of federally funded research were actually used for the benefit of consumers. This law, which is somewhat akin to India's compulsory licensing provisions in the Patents Act, acts as a safeguard if federally funded inventions are not offered at reasonable terms or used in ways that are detrimental to the public interest. In such cases, the agency that provided the funding can grant licences to third parties. The federal agency which poured money into remdesivir is nih. The worries of the states, which have been left to fend for themselves by the Trump Administration, are easy to understand. If Gilead supplies 85 per cent of its remdesivir to the US alone, and their concerns is that it will not, only 1.7 million of the 4.6 million confirmed covid -19 patients in the country (as of August 3) would have access to full treatment. Even if it supplies 90 per cent of its production to the home market it would not be able to meet the contingency. The system so far has not shown that it has the guts to take on the big drug firms. Several appeals filed by public health groups and even lawmakers on the predatory pricing adopted by these companies have been consistently rejected by nih. Will the pandemic make a difference?

He enjoys that status of an icon of resistance, and his songs are still being rendered across the world in protests and concerts. He was killed in 1973 by the dictator Augusto Pinochet who toppled the socialist government of Salvador Allende. He wrote his last lyrics just before his death that read: \"How hard it is to sing when I must sing of horror/ Horror which I am living, horror which I am dying.\" James Dean Bradfield of the rock band Manic Street Preachers has recorded a new album on Jara's life and death. It also comes with a three-part podcast series titled Inspired by Jara . \"The world is awash with bullshit, and we are drowning in it.\" This is how the preface to the book Calling Bullshit: The Art of Scepticism in a Data- Driven World starts. Written by Jevin D West, a theoretical and evolutionary biologist and Carl T Bergstrom, a data scientist, the book guides you on how to navigate for truth in the world of misinformation. \"Bullshit\" in this book stands for data manipulation and misinformation. It is full of tools\u2014not the kind of mathematical formulas\u2014that help us out of the trap of fake news and data-tweaking to enforce a particular message.Economist Jeff Rubin's The Expendables is the latest addition to powerful works on the near-death of globalisation and free trade as a universal ideology. In this book he argues that inequality in the world has made free trade a taxing experience for local economies, particularly to the middle class. In developed economies, the book explains, the rich harvested all the fruits of globalisation and free trade. Irrespective of a textual existence, the so-called middle class has, indeed, vanished.

P50The low-profile pink water of Kerala can ward off infections P54Paddy farmers can make huge gains from Zero Budget Natural Farming P56From where did the tiger come? GENETICISTS, HISTORIANS AND EXPERTS HAVE SEVERAL THEORIES ON THE BIG CAT RAJAT GHAI IT IS impossible to tell when tigers walked into India. \"We can, however, suggest when the habitats in India were appropriate for tigers, or when they diverged and became distinct from other tiger populations,\" says Uma Ramakrishnan, molecular ecologist and assistant professor at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bengaluru. No scholar can give an exact date for this, says Mahesh Rangarajan, professor of history and environmental studies at Ashoka University at Sonipat. They will just give the accidentally surviving evidences that have accumulated over time, he says, adding, \"If you see the references in author Shibani Bose's latest work Mega Mammals in Ancient India: Rhinos, Tigers, and Elephants , the tiger was very much here in the historic times, say 5,000 years ago.\" Records show a long association of the tiger with humans, he says. In her book, Bose uses \"an archive comprising archaeology, a gamut of literary texts as well as visual depictions\" to etch out histories of rhinos, elephants and tigers in ancient India. \"The tiger has scant presence in the fossil record, but figures in the archaeological record at Mesolithic Mahadaha, Neolithic Loebanr III and Aligrama in Swat, at Atranjikhera and at Madar Dih,\" her book notes. Despite scant evidence as far as BACK TO CONTENTPalette /LIFE & NATUREfossils are concerned, tigers abound in literary and pictorial representations of ancient India. India's 'tiger man' Valmik Thapar writes in his 2002 book The Cult of the Tiger : \"The earliest depictions of the tiger on the Indian subcontinent go back to Harappan seals dating back to 2500 BC. Sometimes the tiger is horned and is seen standing with a trough-like object in front of him. On another seal is an intriguing figure, the hind portion of which is that of a tiger and the front portion that of a woman; the woman has a conspicuous long plait and a tree growing above her head. Another seal depicts a nude female, upside down with thighs held wide apart, with two tigers standing on one side. The ritual significance is not clear but evidently, it evokes a feminine connection of the tiger with either fertility or birth.\" THE CHINESE ROUTE In the recent past, experts have attempted to put tentative dates for the arrival of the tiger in the subcontinent. \"Studies based on models of habitats and climate suggest tigers occupied most of India around 12,000 years ago,\" says Ramakrishnan, citing Biogeographical Change in the Tiger, Panthera Tigris by Andrew C Kitchener and Andrew J Dugmore. \"Previous studies indicate tigers might have evolved near the south China region and dispersed from there,\" says Ramakrishnan. Large cats, including tigers, evolved from a common ancestor, probably similar to the modern- day leopard or the jaguar five million years ago, Thapar writes in his book. \"Our studies based on genome sequencing suggest that Indian tigers diverged from other tigers (Left): The Pashupati seal discovered at the Mohenjodaro archaeological site depicts a seated figure surrounded by several animals, including the tiger; (Below): Bonbibi, the guardian spirit of the Hindu and Muslim residents of the Sundarbans, fights a demon king who appears in the guise of a tiger BACK TO CONTENT DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWN TO EARTH 51 relatively recently, around 8,000- 9,000 years ago,\" says Ramakrishnan. A question that arises is, if tigers evolved in southern China, which route did they take to enter South Asia? Here, Ramakrishnan offers a tantalising clue. \"Our models of demographic history of tigers using whole genome sequences suggest northeast Indian tigers are (a) closest to southeast Asian tigers, and (b) the most divergent of populations within Indian tigers. Together, these results indicate that tigers may have entered India through northeast India,\" she says. Divyabhanusinh Chavda, author of two highly-acclaimed books on India's lions and cheetahs, echoes Ramakrishnan's views. \"You are finding tigers at very high altitudes in Nepal and Bhutan. It is quite possible that the tiger may have crossed over from the Himalayas, somewhere in the Arunachal and upper Assam area,\" he says. Down To Earth ( dte) in its article 'Roars in lost land' (March 16-31, 2019) had reported how tigers emerged in the snow-clad Eastern Himalayas of Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim in 2017 and 2018. dte questioned whether the tigers sighted always lived there or were migrants in search of a better habitat. But after the tiger came to India, how did it colonise the country's entire landmass? Thapar does not give a time or the route, but writes in The Cult of The Tiger : \"The tiger quickly spread throughout India, moving into the mangrove swamps, evergreen forests, dry deciduous forests, and the variety of other vegetation that covered Indian land.\" Ramakrishnan offers more cues: \"Demographic simulations using whole genome sequences potentially suggest that the northeast Indian tigers are the most distinct. There are other populations of tiger in India, like central Indian tigers, Western Ghats tigers and south Indian tigers, but they diverged from each other around the same tiger.\" So what can be deduced is that tigers moved to India roughly 12,000 years ago, possibly through the Eastern Himalayas. However, this wisdom can change. \"This whole business of evolution is in a flux. Everyday, something new pops up,\" says Chavda. DTE\"MOLECULAR DATA AND FOSSIL GOLD STANDARD IS NEEDED\" Scientists used DNA to find how tigers evolved, says SAMRAT MONDOL, associate professor at the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun Where did the tigers originate? They originated in southern China and then spread to different directions, colonising regions. Evidences, including molecular data, prove this. Fossils, however, are few. The pattern in which tigers colonised Asia is somewhat similar to how humans colo - nised the world after evolving in Africa. As tigers moved, they started living in different habitats, which brought about morphologi - cal and other changes in them. This is how separate subspecies of the tiger arose. What does molecular data mean? Molecular data is DNA-based. Our DNA retains the history of what we have gone through over several years. That is because the DNA changes under different situations. For instance, if I live in a zone that has high nuclear radiation, my DNA will change. If I survive the radiation, that DNA will be propagated through my offspring. That will then slowly become a separate signature. Changes in DNA depend on time. If time is more, then more changes will be registered and vice versa. There are a lot of mathematical ap - proaches that help us track these changes, such as which change happened earlier and which one is newer. This is how scientists have used DNA to find how tigers evolved. Molecular data along with fossils are the gold standard for understanding the history of a species. What does molecular data suggest about tiger colonis ation of Asia and the Indian subcontinent?This is a bit difficult, as intensive DNA data is required of all tiger subspecies in the same format. Without this, it cannot be compared as to which subspecies is old and which one is new. This has been the biggest challenge for research on the tiger. It has only been in the past five years or so that people have started generating such data.

One of the few places where you can find these simple tenets of Ayurve - da put into practice, is Kerala\u2014the land with a rich heritage of the traditional medicine. I had a first hand experience of this during one of my reporting assignments to the coastal state. I was travelling across villages to cover a major outbreak of chikungunya. In the villages that I visited, I was greeted with a glass of pink water. The practice is so common that even restaurants serve the co - loured water. I later learned that it comes loaded with antioxidants and is meant to ensure one's wellness. Even Ayurvedic spas use it to aid in the process of detoxification. Since most households in Kerala villages depend on well water, they traditionally consume it after boiling to ward off water-borne illnesses. Many a time what they do is throw a few herbs into PHOTOGRAPH: VIKAS CHOUDHARY / CSEBACK TO CONTENT 54 DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.IN Palette /FOODthe water and let it boil. They call it dahasamani or herb-infused water. Usually, it is consumed warm. Since one consumes two to three litres of water a day, dahasamani's therapeutic effect is an added advantage. But there is no standard recipe or name for it. People in Kerala choose from a variety of herbs and condiments like dry ginger, cardamom, cloves, coriander seeds, cumin seeds, basil vetiver and sandalwood to prepare the water. When cumin seeds are added, they call it jeeraka vella ; malli vella when infused with coriander seeds. The pink water is prepared using a concoction of herbs, that include the wood of pathimukham or Himalayan cherry tree, and are available as ready-mixes sold in Ayurvedic shops. The tree, Prunus cerasoides in scientific lexicon, belongs to the Rosacease family and is closely related to apples. It has a range of applications in traditional medi - cine and is used in proprietary products, such as research suggests that its wood, which imparts pink colour when added to water, has medici - nal value. One study by research - ers from South Korea, China and the US shows that the tree parts contain relatively high levels of flavones and isoflavones which can work as potential sources of phytoestrogens and help alleviate postmenopausal symptom. The paper has been published in the June 2020 issue of journal Phyto - therapy Research . Another study by the Depart - ment of Microbiology at Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, underscores the tree's ability to purify water. The researchers looked at its constituents respon - sible for antimicrobial activity and found that its active ingredients could kill microbes like Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . Herbal alternatives are being explored against the two microbes that have shown resis - tance to multiple antibiotics in recent years. Ethyl acetate is the best organic solution to extract the active ingredients from the stem bark of Himalayan cherry, which can then be used to develop broad-spectrum drugs against the microbes, say the researchers in the journal Applied Biochemistry and Biotechnology in August 2019. In Mizoram, the bark of P cerasoides is traditionally used to treat skin infections like eczema, swelling and wounds. Researchers from the Mizoram University in Aizawl write in the September 2014 issue of the Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine that the plant's efficacy is due to the presence of trace elements like iron, zinc, copper, manganese, cobalt and vanadium. Research also shows its wood extracts in small quantities can stimulate respiration, improve digestion and promote a sense of well-being. However, there are indications that its young shoots and seeds contain cyanogenic glycosides, which if consumed in large quantities can be poisonous. But there is no internal distri - bution of this tree in Kerala, says P Sujanapal, senior scientist at the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Thrissur. Getting it all the way from the Himalayas makes it expensive. So, many dahasamani mixes use the bark of sappan wood (Caesalpinia sappan ) for the pink colour. This small tree is native to Indo-Malaysian region, grows easily in the climatic conditions of Kerala and is sometimes promoted as a live fence around forest areas to protect wild animals, says Sujanapal. A red pigment, called brazilin, can be obtained from the wood which is then used as a natural dye on fabrics like cotton, silk and wool and for making red paints and inks. Some researchers in Tamil Nadu have found that the dye can be used as a food colour and that its chemicals are not toxic to humans even when consumed in high doses. A decoction of the heartwood in fact helps regulate menstrual flow. It is also used to cure tuberculosis, diarrhoea and dysentery and is reported as having hypoglycaemic properties. Unlike sparkling water, herbal teas and fruit infused water which, driven by strategic advertisements, have become the rage among the health conscious, the healing water of Kerala seems to have kept a low profile. So, this wet season when the risk of infection through food and water is high, why don't you give it a try?

AGRICULTURE IS both the cause and victim of water scarcity. Excessive use of water threatens the sustainability of livelihoods dependent on water and agriculture, says the Food and Agriculture Organization. In India, the Green Revolution had a phenomenal impact on India's food production, but it also rendered the land infertile, led to extensive water consumption and aggravated groundwater loss. As per the Central Water Commission, the country's agriculture sector already consumes over 83 per cent of the available water resources. And the demand will grow. In the recent past, there has been a global demand to shift to sustainable farming systems, such as Zero Budget Natural Farming ( zbnf). India, too, introduced zbnf in its Union Budget 2019-20. As the name suggests, it is the adaptation of an ancient practice ILLUSTRATION: RITIKA BOHRA / CSERELATED STORYBACK TO CONTENT Palette /OPINION DOWN TO EARTH 1-15 SEPTEMBER 2020 DOWNTOEARTH.ORG.INwhich reduces farmers' direct cost and encourages them to use natural inputs, such as cow dung and cow urine. The inputs help manage soil nutrition, fertility, pests and seeds. The technology requires less tilling and completely rejects the use of inorganic fertilisers, pesticides and herbicides. It is also water-efficient. Of late, all these benefits have been popularised, but in 2019 a group of researchers tried to quantify it. At the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy ( cstep ), researchers conducted an exploratory study in Andhra Pradesh to compare zbnf and non- zbnf techniques in paddy, groundnut, chilli, cotton and maize farming. The comparison was made on six parameters\u2014water, electricity and energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, yield and net revenue. The study was conducted in West Godavari, Prakasam, Vizianagaram and Anantapuramu districts during kharif season, ensuring variation in agro-climatic zones, farming techniques, production and social aspects. The study, published in February 2020, found the maximum benefits of zbnf in paddy farming, with a saving of 1,400 to 3,500 cubic metre of water per acre per paddy cropping period (one acre equals 0.4 hectare). This was accomplished by increasing the time interval of irrigation cycles\u2014every eight to 10 days\u2014unlike the conventional method which requires watering every five to six days. The water saving was attributed to multiple aeration practice. This water management method involves periodic aeration of the soil between watering periods. Water consumption in paddy cultivation depends on the frequency and depth of irrigation. Paddy farms under zbnf were irrigated with only 2.54 cm to 5.7 cm deep water while those under non- zbnf had to be watered up to 12.7 cm. zbnf advocates mulching of crop residues to promote moisture retention in soil and increase humus. It also involves waaphasa, or soil aeration, to reduce water consumption. The traditional flood irrigation is plagued with inconsistent spread of nutrients with excess water use, which can also drop crop productivity. Although the study did not observe much impact on crop yield, multiple aeration and reduced water use showed other benefits. In just one crop season, electricity consumption of farms relying on groundwater reduced by 1,500-3,900 units per acre, and saved ` 6,000-16,000. Further, multiple aeration hinders microbial activity and cuts methane emissions by 88 per cent, compared to the conventional flooding practice. This leads to an additional saving of fossil fuels used for electricity generation and emissions reduction. GROWING PADDY CAN SAVE WATER If all of India's paddy area\u201443-44 million ha\u2014is brought under zbnf, 150-400 billion cubic metre of water can be potentially saved. The volume is equivalent to storage potential of 40 to 100 Tehri dams, one of India's biggest dams located in Uttarakhand. Additionally, zbnf can address several on-ground challenges, such as groundwater-stress, water disparity in canal water usage, and overuse of resources (flooded irrigation). In India, 70 per cent of the farms rely on groundwater, which depletes reserves. In water- stressed zones, tubewells have to be dug up to about 300 metres. zbnf can avoid the current drawing of groundwater by 50 to 60 per cent, ensure adequate groundwater reserve, improve water table and reduce financial and labour stress on farmers. zbnf farming can also solve disputes between farming communities where upstream farmers employ canal irriga-tion and end up guzzling more water, leaving downstream farms with insufficient volume. zbnf does show water-saving potential and can address India's food and security in the long run, but deep investigation is required to ascertain if it can be replicated in the various agro-climatic zones across the country. As they say, Rome was not built in a day, similarly, zbnf requires time and policy support so that the government provides monetary help for it to be adopted in all the states.

Over 8 million more hectares are under cultivation compared to last year. There are now more people in the farms; most of them had once quit agriculture and migrated to towns and cities but are now back in villages due to the covid -19 lockdown. There has also been a significant increase in the acreage of almost all crops; the area under rice, which sustains the maximum number of farmers in the country, is largest in the past five years. To add to the cheer, the latest report by the State Bank of India ( sbi) says the agriculture sector has been immune to the impacts of the pandemic. Rather, this is the only major economic sector that would witness a growth of 3 per cent this fiscal year; the rest are going to shrink. Earlier on June 2, the Union government increased the minimum support price ( msp) of 14 kharif crops to provide relief to farmers. Hopes float in the corridors of the finance ministry. Many say this would help revive the economy, if not this financial year, then definitely in the next one. They say it because they believe that an increase in agricultural yield will lead to more income, which, in turn, would lead to more consumption among rural Indians and eventually add to the sluggish national economy. But farmers don't appear jubilant. In recent times, they have not seen a natural correlation between the yield from their farms and the income from it. Rather, the more they produce, the less they earn. This is despite the consistent increase in demand for food in the country. Small wonder, immediately after the declaration of msp, farmers took to the streets, demanding a higher assured price and citing huge losses even with an enhanced support price. According to a report by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation Development and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Indian farmers have lost R45 lakh crore due to \"non-proper\" pricing of the product between 2000 and 2017. Even msp, which the government pursues as the primary support system to ensure fair price, covers just 6-10 per cent of farmers. This is also a concern for the political leadership as the promise to double farmers' income by 2022-23 is hardly 30 months away. Ideally this year should have been that springboard to catch up with the target. By 2022-23, to achieve this target, a farmer's annual income has to be at least R 192,694 from R96,703 in 2015-16. This needs a 10.4 per cent annual income growth till the target year, according to the government's own estimate. For this, the income ratio of a farmer has to fundamentally change: the current ratio of 60:40 from farm and non-farm income has to be turned into 70:30. But this involves a farmer increasing his/her investment on farming by 12.5 per cent annually. This is possible if he/she earns enough to invest more. The government committee that recommended ways to double farmers' income also said that the biggest challenge is to monetise farmers' produce, meaning to ensure more economic return. This has not been possible. Rather in the past five-six years, farmers are increasingly facing a glut in the market for their produce. A bumper harvest is expected again in the winter. But under the prevailing circumstances, no one can say for sure if the government will ensure a fair price for it. The food stock in its granaries are already too high, thus curtailing its capacity to buy more at msp. For the farmers, it means another round of distress selling or even not being able to sell their harvest. This will lead to a loss in income and add to their debt burden. It is a disturbing climax to a seemingly milestone year.
