WORKSE SSION Instruction, Research, & Student Affairs A. NWCCU Discussion Dr. Sandra Elman, President of NWCCU was scheduled to facilitate a discussion and provide an opportunity for more detailed questions and answers. Due to complications from the weather, Dr. Elman cancelled her trip to the meeting. As a result, the NWCCU discussion will take place at a later date. Planning, Policy & Governmental Affairs (PPGA) B. Idaho Indian Education Committee - Tribal Governance Structure Discussion A presentation was led by Helo Hancock, Legislative Director for the Coeur d'Alene Tribe, and Dr. Chris Meyer of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and Co- Chair of the Indian Education Committee, and Bob Sobbota, also a Co- Chair of the Indian Education Committee. Mr. Hancock provided some background on himself as well as a summarized overview of the history of Idaho Tribes starting as far back as when settlers came west, illustrating the challenges the Tribes have faced over the years. He provided a handout included in the agenda materials summarizing facts about the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and background on federal policy in Indian Country. Mr. Hancock pointed out several misconceptions about life on an Indian reservation that was unfortunately used in many governmental decisions over the years. Mr. Hancock spoke to the unique role the tribes have with the Board's Indian Education Committee and on the unique cultural and socioeconomic issues facing the tribes around the state. He also pointed out that Tribes, for the most part, are treated as a sovereign nation and generally speaking, state laws don't apply to Tribes and Tribal members within a reservation (although there are exceptions). He also pointed out the converse is true, that Tribal laws generally don't apply to non- India ns on reservations, but there are also exceptions to that. He pointed out this creates a complicated jurisdictional maze when dealing with Indian reservations. Tribes have a unique relationship with the Federal government, making them quite different in terms of a minority population. Mr. Hancock indicated that nearly 40% of their budget is Federal dollars, and the rest of their budget is made up through Tribal economic development initiatives. He discussed how Tribes do a lot for their communities and those endeavors are sometimes overlooked. Mr. Hancock discussed the Indian Education Committee and how a majority of Native American Indian students attend public schools, stating that those students face unique cultural and socioeconomic challenges. He praised the Board for establishing the Indian Education Committee and felt over time it will produce some extremely productive results. There was discussion about how the Board can work with the Tribes to meet the unique needs of American Indian students enrolled in the state's public schools and institutions. Dr. Meyer commented how important it was for Tribes to have the Indian Education Committee under the Board and expressed gratitude for that. She welcomed the ability to come before the Board with questions and issues. Dr. Meyer acknowledged Board members Clark and Ybarra for their visit to the Coeur d'Alene Tribe and thanked them for their time and interest and their relationships with the school districts. The Tribe was proud to have such esteemed visitors. Mr. Scoggins asked how many American Indian students are in public schools and what kinds of problems they are facing. Dr. Meyer responded that 75% of Indian students are attending public school. One of the most significant issues are high dropout rates at the high schools which is alarming. Ms. BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 5 Selena Grace, member of the Indian Education Committee, added that Tribal students make up about two percent of the enrollment population, and almost 90% of those students attend public schools. There are two Tribal schools in the state. She commented that from a Committee perspective, the most helpful thing the Board could do would be in looking at those policy issues facing the Tribes which impact curriculum, and engaging Tribal leaders in the discussion of the development of that curriculum, because of the historical dynamics of the Indian minority population. For the Board to reach out directly to Tribal education departments through Tribal leadership is key to developing curriculum and standards. Ms. Johanna Jones from the Department of Education echoed those comments. She added that funding for teacher education programs would be very important and commented on some recommendations for the Board to look at such as equity in opportunity for American Indian students and scholarships like the Opportunity Scholarship. Dr. Meyer added that that the teachers should be required to take the Tribal Sovereignty Course. Mr. Freeman asked what the Board could do to increase the go- in rate among the Tribes, and pointed out the Direct Admissions Initiative has been extended to the Tribes. Dr. Meyer reaffirmed that the curriculum presently shows an insensitivity to Native Americans and it should be addressed. She felt Native American Indians are not being recognized or acknowledged as citizens and they feel faceless. Tribes want the Board to look at the curriculum and standards to put a face to the Tribes of Idaho rather than referring to them as savages. Ms. Jones added that the teachers are not invested in the students or the communities. Teacher investment is very important where the teachers learn about the Tribes, and the culturally sensitive pedagogy, and further remarked on the insensitivity toward the Tribes. Superintendent Ybarra commented on some of the positive things that are going on related to the Tribes and encouraged other Board members to personally visit some of the Tribes. She thanked the committee members for their work. Ms. Critchfield suggested there are some things the Planning and Policy Committee could address including some of the curriculum and standards issues. She thanked the Indian Education Committee for their time, expertise and passion in this work. Ms. Atchley added that Curtis Elke, State Conservationist from the Natur al Resources Conservation Service, offered his commitment to working with the Idaho Indian Education Committee and is expected to speak in December at the Indian Education Committee meeting. Ms. Atchley felt Mr. E lke would be able to help the Committee have more help at the national level. C. Performance Reporting Mr. Carson Howell and Dr. Cathleen McHugh provided a presentation to the Board on performance reporting. Dr. McHugh began the presentation with data from the IPEDS Data Feedback Reports and performance measures related to LCSC. Dr. McHugh provided an overview of what the data dashboard would look like, how to navigate through it on the various tabs, and what peers are relevant to the institution and their geographic location. Dr. McHugh reviewed academic year tuition and fees for LCSC and their peer institutions showing they are near the bottom in terms of fees charged compared to their peers. She reviewed similar data for grant aid; LCSC is toward the top in terms of institutional aid for students. Dr. McHugh reviewed graduation rates, which can be broken down into ethnic groups and gender. Ms. Critchfield asked if the Board is still connected to the measures previously agreed upon or if the measures needed to be changed. Mr. Howell responded Board staff is reporting on what they feel is useful for the Board and to illustrate the status of the institutions and how they are doing. She asked the Board if these measures will be the ones to help guide the Board's decision making. Mr. Howell responded that the dashboard would be constructed in a way using the data the Board would find most useful. Mr. Soltman expressed an interest in being able to see trends statewide and among institutions. There was discussion about remediation, and Mr. Howell pointed out some difficulty reporting on remediation and variables in looking at remediation rates over time. There was additional discussion on development of the dashboard and maneuverability on the menu. Mr. Howell next reported on the dual credit headcount and credit hours. He noted the slope as a result of the fast forward program, has changed for the better and now more students are taking dual credit than BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 6 ever before. He noted the percentage growth from 2011- 2015, and the growth has been in over 800% for students who are earning over 20 credits. In looking at dual credit earned by subject area, the top two areas are English and Math. Related to AP exams taken, there is been about a 30% increase in the number of AP exams. Go- on rates (both 1- year and 3 -year) have declined slightly since 2011 which includes both in- state and out -of-state institutions. There was discussion about the go- on rates, and Mr. Howell pointed out that those students who are taking dual credit courses are more likely to go on. Mr. Westerberg also suggested tracking the amount of debt students are accumulating and whether it has an effect on go- on rates. There was some concern about not seeing an increase in Idaho's go- on rates. One question was how does dual credit impact persistence and completion, or if it does. If not, what does? Mr. Scoggin recommended including the benchmark on the slides for comparative purposes. Mr. Howell reported 10 th day statewide numbers show an increase from 2015 to 2016 of students going on or graduating. He reported on go- on rates by gender which shows that women are enrolling at significantly higher rates than men which also holds true by region. Go- on rates by race/ethnicity also shows a gap between whites and Hispanic and American Indian student populations. Mr. Howell commented on the importance of reporting on demographic data, pointing out how impactful growth rates for different ethnic populations can be regionally. He reported that postsecondary enrollment system -wide has dropped since 2012, and reviewed full time and part time enrollment at each of the institutions. Dr. McHugh reviewed board- approved types of remediation which include the accelerated model, the co- requisite model, and the emporium model. In terms of English remediation, all Idaho institutions use the co-requisite model. Roughly 85% of students needed remediation in college- level English. Related to Math remediation, Dr. McHugh pointed out the Math data should not be used to compare institutions because neither the definitions nor the cohorts are uniform across the institutions. Dr. McHugh reported that overall, compared to the two year institutions, there is a smaller share of students at the four year institutions needing Math remediation. Ms. Atchley felt it would be important to see data on those students who did not successfully complete courses. Dr. McHugh indicated the specific data is included in the agenda material packet attached to this work session. Ms. Atchley specifically wanted to know what happens to students if remediation is unsuccessful. Mr. Howell went on to discuss retention rates based on two year and four year institutions. The comparison was for students attending the same institution for the duration (students going from a two year to a four year institution are not included in the count). Retention rates at the four year institutions show retention at a higher rate, and female students were retained at a higher rate. By race/ethnicity, retention rates were all very close in numbers, showing a less than 3% variance between races. Mr. Howell reported on how the institutions' retention rates were rated related to peer institutions. He reported on graduation rates from 2011 to 2015 at each of the institutions, and graduation rates as compared to the institution peers which included gend er and race/ethnicity detail. Mr. Howell reported on degree production from 2011 to 2015, showing the rates have increased for the number of students receiving degrees and certificates. He added the state could definitely benefit from degree production, but that it also depends on what happens to those graduates after receiving their degrees such as who leaves the state (i.e., STEM graduates who leave the state for higher wages). Mr. Howell compared cost per credit by institution, pointing out that students who needs additional or special services would increase the cost per credit. Mr. Freeman pointed out the benchmark is $400. Mr. Howell reported on progress toward the 60% goal. He indicated that in 2010 we were at 37% and in 2014 we are at 40%, adding that it is on the cusp of being statistically significant. Ms. Bent reminded the Board members that they would be reviewing and discussing the Board's strategic plan in December, including reviewing the benchmarks. She requested any recommendations or changes be sent to Board staff. Mr. Westerberg requested more summary data at a higher level, and less granular information in order to BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 7 understand where the trends are. There was consensus on next year having just state level data. The Board recessed the meeting at 4:30 Pacific Time. Thursday October 2 0, 201 6, 8:00 a.m., Lewis- Clark State College, Williams Conference Center, Lewiston, Idaho The Board reconvened at Lewis -Clark State College in the Williams Conference Center for regular business. Board President Atchley called the meeting to order at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time and thanked LCSC for their hospitality. OPEN FORUM There were no requests to speak during open forum.

The motion carried unanimously. Ms. Stacy Pearson, Vice President for Finance and Administration at BSU, indicated they are requesting approval to proceed with a new building to house the Art Department. The request was noted as one of the highest priority major capital projects for BSU. Fundraising and planning efforts to relocate the department began in early 2013, and in April 2013 the Board approved a request for the planning and design of a new Fine Arts Building. This project will be procured through the Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) process through DPW and/or the Idaho Division of Purchasing standard process(es) as appropriate. Dr. Kustra provided a thorough explanation of how the art museum will look with floor to ceiling s creens that portray what it looks like to walk through other museums in the world. Ms. Pearson provided an overview of the budget and pointed out BSU intends to issue bonds to finance a portion of this building and will seek Board approval at the December 2016 meeting to issue those bonds prior to starting construction. Ms. Atchley complemented BSU on the vision of the project. PLANNING, POLICY & GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS (PPGA) 2. Idaho Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (IDVR) Annual Progress Report Ms. Jane Donnellan, Administrator of the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, provided an overview of IDVR's progress in carrying out the agency's strategic plan. Ms. Donnellan outlined the IDVR's program structure and focused primarily on the vocational rehabilitation program for the presentation. She pointed their program is not a welfare program but one that provides services to eligible citizens to help them on their path to self -sufficiency and go from unemployment to employment. She reviewed the organizational structure of the program, and that there is a strong educational process involved in the program. Ms. Donnellan outlined the IDVR delivery system to its recipients, indicating that IDVR is also a resource to state employers. She identified the regional offices in the 8 regions of the state; there are three regions contained in the Treasure Valley. Ms. Donnellan reviewed some of IDVR's accomplishments, and in 2016 there were over 2,000 individuals eligible for employment. In 2016 there was a 506% increase in customer wages after receiving IDVR services, a 3% increase in successful employment outcomes. She reviewed the average wages of IDVR customer s since 2012 and that it has shown an increase over the years. Their goal is to help individuals to find good paying jobs. Additionally, IDVR supports postsecondary training - success in training equals success in employment. Ms. Donnellan reviewed some success stories of individuals in the IDVR program. Ms. Donnellan reviewed the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) of 2014 and reviewed some of the challenges the Act has generated for the division. She outlined the key elements of WIOA and how it effects IDVR. Ms. Donnellan highlighted some of the projects that have been developed for students with disabilities and details of those projects. Those projects included the BSU Prep Academy, the LCSC College Readiness Educational Workshop (CR EW), the BSU Mentoring Transition Project, ISU Bengals' Pre- employment Transition Services Project, UI's McCall Outdoor Science School Project, and the BSU On-BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 10 line Digital Literacy Skills Project.

She reviewed partnerships which included collaborations with a number of other state agencies. She pointed out that without these partnerships IDVRs services to its customers would be adversely impacted. 3. STEM Action Center Update Ms. Angela Hemingway, Executive Director of the STEM Action Center (Center), provided an update for the Board. The Center is dedicated to providing a STEM competitive workforce by implementing Idaho's kindergarten through career STEM education programs. She reviewed the individuals who make up the members of the STEM Action Center Board, and identified their mission and vision statements. She reviewed two pieces of legislation specific to STEM Action Center, and how they are working with the State Board of Education, the Department, industry, educators, and universities to create Idaho specific K -12 computer science standards. Ms. Hemingway indicated they expect to experience significant STEM job growth over the next ten years. Idaho is one off the top five states, and STEM jobs in Idaho pay much higher than jobs in other sectors with the median wage at $32 per hour, or an average of $67,833 annually. The state currently has over 6,000 stem job openings presently. Ms. Hemingway reported on the number of men and women in STEM fields, but that women are behind in numbers. She provided that Idaho ranks 49 th in wom en earning computer science degrees, and provided an illustration of the percentage of women earning bachelor's degrees in various STEM areas. Ms. Hemingway reviewed the goals of the STEM Center's strategic plan of which the main goal is to coordinate and facilitate implementation of stem programs throughout Idaho. She reviewed some of the events, scholarships, competitions, grants, and professional development initiatives, and reported on participation in science and engineering fairs. Related to their second goal, Ms. Hemingway reported on the alignment between education and workforce. Related to their third goal to increase awareness of STEM throughout Idaho, she identified a number of efforts to increase that awareness. She reviewed professional development opportunities, student competitions, and reported on some of the strong partnerships they are forming in the state with industry. Ms. Hemingway reported that they are working to create a virtual, project -based, statewide mentorship program, and outlined the details and vision of this program. Ms. Hemingway expressed a call of action to the Board to help spread the word about grant and professional development opportunities. Additionally, to help the Board connect with industries that suppor t STEM education, and to partner with the STEM Action Center to create programs to expand STEM K- 20 education efforts. 4. Idaho Department of Labor - Workforce Projections Report Mr. Ken Edmunds, Director of the I daho Department of Labor (I DOL) provid ed a presentation to the Board of the Workforce Projections Report. He introduced Mr. Craig Shaul who accompanied him for the presentation. Mr. Edmunds commented on the potential to collaborate together to solve the problems facing Idaho's workforce. Mr. Edmunds indicated every two years, they do a ten- year projection on total employment of the state. He reported that Idaho is very healthy presently and has experienced a 1.8% in growth which is greater than the national projection. He provided that proj ected growth in jobs and workforce between 2014 and 2024 is 138,000 and 89,000 respectively, so labor supply is a challenge. He provided an illustration of BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 11 projected educational attainment by degree in 2024 and their projections are at 61% which is in lin e with the Board's 60% goal projection. Mr. Edmunds reported on Idaho's Hot Jobs and occupational projections from 2014 to 2024. Formerly healthcare dominated this list, but it has changed to the computer industry with software developers being at the top. He reported on education and training pay which shows how education increases income levels. He reviewed STEM jobs and reported that Idaho's growth in that area is at 26%. Mr. Edmunds discussed work -based learning and that there is a great need to focus on apprenticeships, and a cooperative education model. He reported on college and career advising, and other areas such as adopting a Hispanic initiative, working with veterans, and two programs called Choose Idaho and Targeted Recruiting. He reported on their program called the Talent Accelerator Initiative, funded through 4% of unemployment tax collections, and used for direct employer training reimbursement, industry sector grants, and rural micro- grants. Mr. Edmunds pointed out they are working through a funding decline from $10 million to $5 million and reviewed the proposal and the funding suggestions. He reviewed State Board, Career -Technical Education, and IDOL shared objectives and asked for support in areas which include outcomes based funding, current legislative funding, and the Talent Accelerator Initiative. He asked for collaboration among stakeholders to define college and career readiness, apprenticeships and the 60% goal, college and career advising, alignment of programs to jobs , retention and recruiting of graduates, and the Talent Accelerator Initiative. Mr. Edmunds pointed out IDOL has actively promoted greater collaboration among industry, government and education, particularly in the areas of career awareness for students and job seekers, technical education training and other areas where they have identified gaps in workforce development training.

Temporary Rule - IDAPA 08.02.01 - Data Collection BOARD ACTION M/A ( Critchfield /Westerberg ): To approve the Temporary Rule, IDAPA 08.02.01.251 Rules Governing Administration, Career Ladder Data Collection. The motion 7- 1. Ms. Ybarra voted nay on the motion. Ms. Critchfield indicated this temporary rule will clarify that the requirement for school districts and charter schools to report the data necessary to calculating movement on the career ladder annual that is specified in Section 33- 1004B, Idaho Code, is each of the criteria defined in Section 33- 1001, Idaho Code as the performance criteria as well as the information necessary for determining if a teacher is eligible for the professional endorsement. The temporary rule will provide the Department of Education with the clear directive to collect the necessary data points for calculating instructional staff and pupil service staff movement on the Career Ladder. This calculation is necessary for determining a school district's salary based apportionment. Section 33- 1004B, Idaho Code requires the Department of Education to make the calculations based on the data submitted by the school districts. Ms. Ybarra expressed concern over the additional points proposed for collection. She requested further clarification. Ms. Bent responded that the Board and the Department discussed the level of data needed and the required components specified in Idaho Co de. Ms. Ybarra disagreed with many components added to the temporary rule, stating the Department is already collecting what it needs and that there is not a need for this additional data collection. She felt Department staff and Board staff did not come to an agreement on the content of this rule, reiterating the accountability is already built into the rule. Ms. Bent reiterated that the data elements proposed in the rule are the exact data points specified as the performance criteria that must be met in order for an individual to move on the Career Ladder, with the one addition of the individualized professional learning plan. The professional learning plan is required for individuals to obtain the professional endorsement and the professional endorsement is required to move from the residency rung to the professional rung on the Career Ladder. All of the criteria must be collected to determine if an individual is eligible for movement, further the statute specifies the Department of Education will make the calculation for determining movement. Without the necessary data points movement could not be calculated. Mr. Pete Koehler, Chief Deputy Superintendent, reported on the data that is presently required and for the benefit of the Board members, described the process in detail a district superintendent goes through; requirements are met in 12 separate areas. Mr. Tim Hill, Associated Deputy Superintendent also pointed out they have worked to reduce the number of data elements collected, and their intent to collect those that are most useful. Mr. Westerberg commented on the obligation between the Board and Department to verify the adequacy of the use of the measures being used at the local level, and to ensure the standard is being applied the way it was meant to be applied. Ms. Ybarra recommended additional work on the measures together before passing this temporary rule. Ms. Atchley asked how many data points are being collected. Mr. Koehler responded nearly 600 were being collected and the work of the Department has done has reduced it by nearly 40%. He reported that they have reduced it to more meaningful collection rather than BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 13 a high quantity of data collection. Their goal is to ensure the burden of data collection they require is meaningful and beneficial for reporting. Dr. Clark co mmented on having strong accountability and in not defining it, there are a number of misuses that can happen. She pointed out the committee that made the recommendation to the Task Force and the Task Force recommended heightened accountability and how the money was distributed. Mr. Freeman commented on the input the Board has received from legislators. He reiterated a single yes or no answer would not be sufficient in terms of accountability with regards to the Career Ladder. He commented the purpose of the rule was to make clear the data the Department would collect related to the accountability measures on the Career Ladder. Mr. Scoggin commented that if this temporary rule is enacted the data being collected needs to be looked at as to whether it is being used and if not, the rule would need to be amended. 8. Educator Preparation Programs - Definition - Low Performing Ms. Critchfield provided some background on the item and directed the Board to their agenda materials for greater detail. Annually, the Board certifies and submits Idaho's Title II report to the U.S. Department of Education. The report includes data from public and private teacher preparation programs authorized by the Board to prepare individuals for certification in Idaho. Several years ago, the U.S. Department of Education added a requirement that states must report preparation programs that had been identified as \"Low Performing\" or \"At -Risk of Being Low Performing\" as part of their Title II report. Based on a recommendatio n from the Professional Standards Commission (PSC), for the 2016 report, Idaho used the existing State Program Review process for identifying programs as \"Low Performing\" or \"At-Risk of Being Low Performing\" with the understanding that the PSC would work w ith the Idaho Coalition for Educator Preparation and the Idaho Association of Colleges of Teacher Education to recommend a more robust definition in 2016 and would put the new definition in place prior to submitting the 2017 report. Ms. Critchfield direct ed attention to Attachment 1 which reflects the indicators the PSC recommends for use in developing the definition and criteria for identifying \"Low Performing\", \"At -Risk of Being Low Performing\", and \"Appropriately Performing\" educator preparation programs. If the Board supports the recommendation of the PSC to use the indicators outlined in Attachment 1, the Idaho Coalition for Educator Preparation will use the indicators to develop the full definition and criteria to be used for identifying educat or preparation programs . The draft definition developed by the Idaho Coalition for Educator Preparation will be vetted by the Idaho Association of Colleges of Teacher Education and will then be given to the PSC for review and formal recommendation to the Board. The full definition and criteria will be provided to the Board for consideration at the December 2016 regular Board meeting. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (SDE) 1. Superintendent's Update Superintendent Sherri Ybarra provided an update from the Department. She invited Mr. Duncan Robb, Chief Policy Advisor, to report on the Department's legislative items.

The ESSA requires the Department to go through a process of content coordination with stakeholders across the state. He indicated they expect to have a draft plan by the end of this month and stakeholder input will be gathered. Public feedback forums will be hosted during the first weeks of November. The draft plan will be before the Board at the December meeting. Ms. Ybarra introduced Tony Pierce, Chief Procurement Officer for the Department, to provide an update on the Idaho Reading Indicator (IRI) Request for Proposal (RFP).

An eleven (11) person panel has been assembled to review written technical proposals. After the panel evaluates the proposals, they will be ranked. Once completed, they will work with the contractor on implementation. Mr. Scoggin asked what is driving the decision to upgrade to a different system. Ms. Ybarra responded it is a Governor's Task Force recommendation and that the old system is 20 years old. Mr. Tim Hill next re viewed the Department's budget and discussed the handouts for the Board. The first handout provided an overview of a zero based look at their budget showing all the revenues and expenditures , the second handout illustrated the same zero based look at the public schools portion, and the third handout provided a detailed explanation of their budget request from the FY17 appropriation to the FY18 request . 2.

The number at institutions totals roughly 715 employees and the number at the agencies is roughly 38. He also pointed out that budget increases to cover these changes are not automatically included. Mr. Herbst provided some examples of possible scenarios that could affect employee morale such as some employees would be earning half the leave rate that they were earning before, some may feel that they are demoted to an hourly position, and so forth. He pointed out for the Board the depth of this complicated issue and other economic impacts. Ms. Stacy Pearson from BSU suggested possible establishment of an additional classification called a professional non- exempt group, where they would accrue leave at a different rate.

The motion carried unanimously 7-0. Mr. Westerberg introduced the item indicating that this is the second reading to the proposed amendment to Board Policy II.F. intended to minimize the negative impact on non -classified employees who will become overtime- eligible (but may or may not be permitted to work overtime) and who would be required to accrue leave at a lesser rate under the current policy.

Pending Rule - Docket No. 08- 0203- 1609 - Rules Governing Thoroughness - Graduation Requirements - Proficiency M/S ( Critchfie ld/Ybarra): To approve the pending rule, docket number 08- 0203 -1609, Rules Governing Thoroughness - Proficiency Graduation Requirements, as submitted in Attachment 1. The motion carried unanimously 7-0 . Ms. Critchfield introduced the item and that the proposed amendments to the rule eliminate the ISAT proficiency graduation requirement. The intent is to look at other indicators of success and proficiency for high school students. If approved, students would not need to meet the proficiency requirement to graduate high school after the effective date (end of the 2017 legislative session). No comments were received during the public comment period, and no changes have been made between the proposed and pending rule stages. Ms. Atchley expressed concern about comparing consistency across the state using other measures. Ms. Critchfield responded that there is a required test in high school (SAT) along with a credit requirement for graduation. She pointed out the Accountability Framework recently approv ed includes many other proficiency indicators. Ms. Ybarra echoed those remarks. Dr. Clark commented that further development of the definition of college and career readiness is underway and would be very beneficial. Ms. Ybarra commented the definition of college and career ready has already been defined in the standards. Dr. Clark clarified that the common definition of college and career readiness is being developed which will apply statewide and not just academically. Mr. Freeman offered a point of clarification in that if all of the content BOARDWORK DECEMBER 14, 2016 BOARDWORK Page 24 standards are met, a student is considered college and career ready. However, for the purposes of the Departments of Commerce and Labor, Higher Education, Workforce Development Council, Industry, etc., there is a workgroup in the process of developing a definition of college and career readiness for our students to be able to step into a postsecondary or career setting. OTHER BUSINESS There being no further business, a motion to adjourn was entertained. M/S (Critchfield /Ybarra): To adjourn the meeting at 3:15 p.m. The motion carried unanimously 7-0.

Tracie Bent, OSBE Amy Roche, SDE (coordinates rules developed by SDE staff) Karlynn Laraway, SDE Charter Schools The SDE and potential authorizers (school district or Public Charter School Commission) review new charter petitions in accordance with statutory requirements. These reviews occur at different stages and for different purposes. The SDE review is quantitative and addresses legal sufficiency, while the authorizer review is qualitative and determines whether or not the petitioners should be e ntrusted with taxpayer funds and public school students. The two reviews complement each other and are designed to help both authorizers and the petitioners succeed. PCSC and the SDE receive and review charter schools' fiscal audits. Tamara Baysinger, OSBE Michelle Clement Taylor, SDE College & Career Readiness LEAs submit their College and Career Advising and Mentoring plans to OSBE. LEAs also report the effectiveness of their college and career advising programs as part of their annual continuous improvement plans also submitted to OSBE. Multiple instances of training and guidance are being provided (statewide conferences, regional trainings, local workshops). These activities are conducte d with a high degree of interagency coll aboration (SDE, SBOE, Labor, IDLA). SDE staff is also assisting with the review and compilation of college advising / Byron Yankey, OSBE Tracie Bent, OSBE Matt McCarter, SDE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 4 career mentoring plans submitted by schools. The SDE provides oneonone support to LEAs in this area. Additionally, SBOE promulgation of rules impacting SDE activity and LEA requirements is occurring. OSBE staff review the submitted plans and work with LEAs to help them update their plans to meet all of the statutory requirements set by the legislature as well as those requirements set in Administrative Code. As part of this review, LEA's are also provided with technical assistance and suggested best practices for improving their plans. OSBE provided templates to LEA's that could be used for the submittal of plans, including budgets. The templates we re based on the administrative rule requirements and were not mandatory. College Entrance Exam Need clarity in roles related to implementation of statewide contract, LEA training, collection and use of data, etc. Karlynn Laraway, SDE Data Dashboards SBOE has requested more regular and purposeful discussion about salient K 20 metrics including institutional metrics and data points in the form of a dashboard. Concurrently, the proposed accountability framework includes indicators which would be presented in a data dashboard. There has been some conversation between OSBE and SDE staff about coordinating the data dashboards. Carson Howell, OSBE Chris Campbell, SDE Alison Henken and Carson Howell, OSBE Tim McMurtrey and Dunca n Robb, SDE Direct Admissions OSBE managed the program. SDE provides the student list and GPAs. Carson Howell, OSBE Chris Campbell, SDE Dual Credit Workgroup The Dual Credit Workgroup recommendations are complete and will be presented to the Board for approval in December by SBOE staff. Randall Brumfield and Dana Kelly, OSBE Tina Polishchuk, SDE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 5 Data is being compiled/ analyzed on an ongoing basis to ascertain GEM alignment, student access and dual credit contribution to postsecondary program completion. The Advanced Opportunities program is the primary funding source for students taking dual credit and is influenced by SBOE efforts in this arena. The SDE manages Fast Forward student accoun ts and tracks the appropriation. The SDE provides one on one support to LEAs in thi s area. Additionally, the promulgation of rules impacting SDE activity and LEA requirements is occurring. Educator Effectiveness Clarification is needed on the roles and responsibilities of the SDE Educator Effectiveness work and the OSBE Educator Effectiveness position. Christina Linder, OSBE Karen J.M. Seay, SDE Federal Reporting While we have unique roles in the process, completing Consolidated State Performance Report (CSPR) involves a number of OSBE and SDE staff. SBOE, as the SEA, has to certify and submit the CSPR to U.S. Dept. of Ed on deadline. While there have been challenges in the past in getting accurate and timely data for submittal, we have imp roved our communication and workflow on this project. Alison Henken, OSBE Assessment, Federal Programs and IT staff, SDE Graduation Requirements / Alternate Routes to Graduation The Board promulgates the Administrative Rules establishing graduation requirements and the use (when necessary) of alternate routes to graduation. Currently, both OSBE staff and SDE staff answer questions from LEAs about graduation requirements and use of alternate routes. OSBE receives and reviews the Alternate Route Plans from LEAs.

Randall Brumfield and Patty Sanche z, OSBE Johanna Jones, SDE K12 Accountability There is overlap and sometimes a lack of clarity in regards to the Accountability Oversight Committee's role and tasks and those of the SDE. Some work is done by OSBE staff, some by the AOC, and some work is done by SDE staff. The AOC is a Board Committee with staff supp ort from OSBE. The Committee is charged with making recommendations to the Board regarding the statewide assessment system and K12 accountability. Clarification is needed on the roles and responsibilities of the SDE Title I Accountability work and the OSBE Accountability position. Henken, OSBE Pete Koehler, SDE Karen J.M. Seay, SDE Literacy Committee The Literacy Committee is composed of one Board member (Debbie Critchfield), one OSBE staff, two SDE staff, one legislator (Rep. VanOrden), Alison Henken, OSBE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 7 and a variety of educators. The committee was developed as a subcommittee of the Governor's Task Force and is charged with making recommendations on the literacy related Task Force recommendation. The Committee has made recommendations regarding changes that should happen to improve literacy outcomes. Most recently, based on the work of the Early Literacy Assessment Working Group, they recommend e d the state release a RFP to identify a new assessment to be used as the IRI. The SDE is overseeing the RFP process. Literacy Intervention OSBE receives and reviews Literacy Intervention Plans from the LEAs. SDE manages the funding. SDE receives annual IRI data, but Literacy Interventions Plans also include a section where LEAs provide data and set benchmarks for future performance. Literacy Plan/IRI: The literacy plans were submitted to the SBOE and reviewed by their staff, however the SDE receives questions regarding da ta collection (IRI Results), form templates, expenditures, budgets, funding distribution, etc. related to the plans and associated allocations for intervention funding. The SDE distributes the funds, based on IRI results. If the SDE were to receive questions regarding programmatic implementation, best practices, interven tion strategies - we would need to review the plans to offer support/resources or direct distri cts to the Board. OSBE staff review the submitted plans and work with LEAs to help them update their plans to meet all of the statutory requirements set by the Alison Henken, OSBE Diane Roberts, SDE Karlynn Laraway, SDE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 8 legislature as well as those requirements set in Administrative Code. As part of this review, LEA's are also provided with technical assistance and suggested best practices for improving their plans. OSBE provided templates to LEA's that could be used for the submittal of plans, including budgets. The templates were based on the administrative rule requirem ents and were no t mandatory. Math Work Group The Math Work Group is chaired by Dave Hill. The group includes OSBE staff, SDE staff, higher education representatives, and others. The group is looking at math achievement and ways that math outcomes can be improved. Statewide convening, followed by regional summits were held to calibrate postsecondary math pathways and scale up the wider use of corequisite reme diatio n.

There is confusion in the districts between school improvement plans required by the ISDE and the continuous improvement plans (formerly called strategic plans) required by statute. Who at the Board reads the cont inuous improvement plans? What purpose do they serve? Does the Board approve these? Ideally, LEAs would complete one plan that meets requirements for both entities. Tracie Bent, OSBE Karen J.M. Seay, SDE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 10 Statutorily continuous improvement plans are submitted to OSBE. OSBE staff review the submitted plans and work with LEAs to help them update their plans to meet all of the statutory requirements set by the legislature as well as those requirements set in Administrative Code. As part of this review, LEA's are also provided with technical assistance and suggested best prac tices for improving their plans. OSBE provided templates to LEA's that could be used for the submittal of plans, including budgets. The templates were based on the administrative rule requirements and were not mandatory. Single College Application OSBE has engaged IDLA to develop for Direct Admissions students a single online application to the eight public postsecondary institutions. SDE is pulling the data that will populate data fields from the students' records to be sent to the institutions. Carson Howell, OSBE Chris Campbell, SDE Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Because of Idaho's unique governance structure, the Consortium has approved for Idaho to have two K12 leads. In cases where there is a vote of the consortium states, the two leads have communicated with each other to reach a consensus. OSBE also is responsible for the Consortium Higher Educa staff and the STEM Action Center all work on STEM initiatives and it is not always clear who is or should be doing what. The Board has a STEM Education Strategic Plan, OSBE focusses on STEM higher education issues and K20 STEM policy issues. SDE implements specific STEM training and programs. Christina Linder, OSBE Scott Hill, SDE Teacher Certification/Effectiveness SDE pulls the data, OSBE analyzes and reports the data. SBOE is responsible for submitting the Federal Title II Cathleen McHugh and Christina Linder, OSBE Lisa Colon, SDE WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB A Page 11 (Higher Education Act Title II) report. This report includes information reported from each approved teacher preparation program and state certification data. The state certification data is collected from SDE. SDE manages the certification application process. Teacher Preparation SBOE is responsible for approval of all teacher preparation programs (public and private), setting minimum standards and assessing the effectiveness of programs. OSBE staff meet regularly with teacher preparations program staff to discuss reporting and accountability issues as well as areas of potential improvement. Currently the PSC makes recommendations on teacher preparation standards as well as program approval. Christina Linder, OSBE Academic Affairs Staff (public academic program approval) Title II work It doesn't look like there is currently a Title IIA (ESEA/ESSA) position at OSBE, but there has been one in the past. Clarification is needed on the difference between any K12 Title IIA activities conducted by OSBE and the role and responsibilities for the SDE Title IIA coordinator. Karen J.M.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section I.M.1. Section 67- 1903, Idaho Code. BACKGROUND/ DISCUSSION The Board's strategic plan is used to define the vision and mission of Idaho's K -20 educational system ; to guide future growth and development, and establish priorities for resource distribution. Strategic planning provides a mechanism for continual review to ensure excellence in education throughout the state. T he strategic plan not only defines the Board's purpose, but establishes realistic goals and objectives that are consistent with its governing ideals, and communicates those goals and objectives to the agencies and institutions under the Board, the public, and other stakeholder groups. Pursuant to the Board's master planning calendar, the Board is scheduled to review and approve its strategic plan annually in December , with th e option of a final approval at the February Board meeting if significant changes are requested during the December Board meeting . Once approved t he institutions and agencies then use the Board's strategic plan to inform their annual updates to their own strategic plans. The agencies and institutions bring their strategic plans forward for approval in April of each year with an option for final approval in June. The update of the strategic plan during the February 2015 Board meeting included a comprehensive update to the plan on the recommendations of a committee appoint ed by the institution presidents and lead by Board staff. At the October 2016 Regular Board meeting, the Board review ed performance measures . This performance measure review is a backward look at progress made during the WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 2 previous year in alignment with the strategic plan approved by the Board at the February 201 5 Board meeting . In addition to the Board's K- 20 Education strategic plan, the Board has developed a number of area specific strategic plans as well as the Complete College Idaho plan, the Complete College Idaho plan includes statewide strategies that have been developed to move the Board's strategic plan forward with a focus on moving the needle on the 60% benchmark for the college completion performance measure ( Percent of Idahoans (ages 25-34 ) who hav e a c olleg e deg ree or certificate requiring one academ ic year or more of st udy). The Indian Education strategic plan, STEM Education strategic plan, and Higher Education Research strategic plan, approved by the Board, are all required to be in alignment with the Board's overall K -20 Strategic Plan. Earlier this summer the Governor asked the Board to develop a five year plan for higher education. The Board's Strategic Plan (Plan) is in fact a five year plan for public education (inclusive of secondary and postsecondary); but fulfilling the Governor's request will require the Board to identify specific activities by which to operationalize the Plan. To that end, Board staff have mapped the Plan's goals and objectives to Board activities and initiatives, and categorized them as: \"Proposed\", \"In Progress\", and \"Operational.\" For example, outcomes -based funding is \"Proposed,\" while Direct Admissions is \"Operational.\" During the August 2016 Board meeting the Board provided feedback requesting a brief summary of each activity be included in the document. The attached Operation Plan incorporates those descriptions. IMPACT Once approved, the institutions and agencies will align their strategic plans to the Board's strategic plan and bring them forward to the Board for consideration in April. The Board and staff use the strategic plan to prioritize statewide education initiatives in Idaho as well as the work of the Board staff. By focusing on critical priorities, Board staff, institutions, and agencies can direct limited resources to maximum effect.

Board staff will walk the Board through the various WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 3 performance measures and discuss the proposed benchmarks. Discussion during the Work Session will focus on progress made toward meeting the Board's goals and whether or not there should be additional amendments made to the plan during this cycle. The performance measure data has been incorporated into the strategic plan to make it easier to identify the progress that has been made and to help facilitate the discussion. In addition to the strategic plan with performance measure data, the annual reports on the Opportunity Scholarship and Duel Credit participation are include, should any Board member want more detailed information on efforts in these areas. This is the third year the Board office has produced the dual credit report, which focuses on the impact of students taking dual credit courses. The Opportunity Scholarship Review is our second look at the impact of the Opportunity Scholarship since the consolidation of the state managed scholarships in 2014. The 2015- 2016 school year is the first year of full. T he Board is required to report on the scholarships effectiveness each y ear to the legislature. The more detailed information is provided to the Board to help inform the progress of these specific focus areas of the Board and provide a more complete picture of the landscape that impacts the progress towards meeting the Board's goals. In additional to the overall strategic plan discussion the Board will also have the opportunity to discuss the discrete activities and initiatives identified in the Operation Plan and prioritize activities. The Operational Plan document will serve as the basis for discussions with a stakeholder group. The stakeholder group will formulate recommendation on the Operational Plan for the Board's consideration at a future date. Amendments to plan may be made during the work session, should the Board h ave no additional amendments following the work session, the Strategic P lan may be approved at this meeting.

While the total number of awards increased by 150 percent, the number of renewals increased by 660 percent. Award Amount The maximum award a student can receive is $3,000 per year. However, a student may receive less if they receive other scholarships and grants. The student can only receive an award up to the difference between th e cost of college and all other scholarships and grants. In award year 2016, there were a total of 282 students (158 high school seniors, 116 college undergraduates, and 8 others) who received an award of $0 due to other scholarships and grants. These st udents can renew their Opportunity Scholarship and be awarded a positive amount in subsequent years. The average award across all students who received a positive amount in award year 2016 was $2,897. The Award Process The Idaho Opportunity Scholarship has two main selection criteria: academic achievement and financial aid. First - time applicants are ranked using a process that assigns academic achievement a rank of 30 percent and financial need a rank of 70 percent. After all renewals are funded, the remaining funds are distributed to the first -time applicants with the highest overall rankings. This figure shows the Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) and GPA for those students who were awarded a scholarship versus those that were not awarded. In award year 2016, a ll otherwise eligible students with an EFC of up to $11,500 were awarded the scholarship. 158116 8 31 3821,026 3.5 4EFC GPAWas not offered Was offered WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 261 Idaho Opportunity Scholarship Evaluation - 2017 Preliminary1 Cathleen M. McHugh, Ph.D.2 November 21 , 2016 In 2013, the Idaho Legislature expanded the existing Idaho Opportunity Scholarship by directing money from other scholarship programs into the Opportunity Scholarship. Funding for the Opportunity Scholarship increased from approximately $1.045 million in FY2014 to approximately $5.1 27 million in FY2015, $5.191 FY2016 , and $10.142 million in FY2017 . The legislation that expanded the Opportunity Scholarship also directed the Idaho State Board of Education to evaluate the program on a regular basis. This paper serves as a preliminary evaluation for 2016. It will be updated as data on college enrollment becomes available. The Idaho Oppo rtunity Scholarship The Idaho Opportunity Scholarship is awarded to Idaho residents who graduate from Idaho high schools and enroll in an Idaho postsecondary educational institution in order to pursue their first undergraduate degree or certificate. In addition to traditional high school graduates, b oth home -schooled students and students who obtain a General Equivalency Diploma (GED) are eligible for the scholarship. Students can initially receive the scholarship either as a high school sen ior o r as an undergraduate attending an eligible Idaho postsecondary educational institution. Students who initially receive the scholarship as an undergraduate must have graduated from an Idaho high school and be making satisfactory academic progress. Students appl y electronically. 3 In addition to the application, students must complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) . A student must have an unweighted cumulative GPA of 3.0 in order to be eligible for the scholarship.4 High school GPAs are us ed for s tudents who have not yet graduated from high school while college GPAs are used for students who apply as undergraduates. After initial receipt of the scholarship, s tudents can renew their sch olarship for up to four years if they continue to meet the eligibility requirements. These requirements include m aintaining a 3.0 GPA during college and maintaining satisfactory academic progress. There are also eligibility requirements with regard to the number of postsecondary academic credit hours attempt ed/completed. Students who have attempted or completed 100 credits must identify a major and submit an academic transcript to the Board Office. A student will not be eligible for renewal of the Opportunity Scholarship if they cannot complete their degre e in the major identified in 2 1 This is an update of the paper \"An Evaluation of the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship\". It was originally written in November 2015 and updated in January 2016. In this update, figures have been updated, added, and deleted. Some of the report, such as descriptions of the scholarship and descriptions of the dimensions on which to evaluate the scholarship , has remained unchanged. 2 Cathleen M. McHugh, Ph.D. Principal Research Analyst Idaho State Board of Education cathleen.mchugh@osbe.idaho.gov 3 Students are able to request paper applications if they are unable to complete the application electronically. 4 Students who receive a GED must receive their GED in Idaho and take either the ACT or SAT to be eligible for the scholarship. GED students must receive a score of at least 20 on the ACT or receive a score of at least 950 on the SAT. WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 272 semesters. Finally, if students interrupt their enrollment for more than 4 months but less than 2 years, then they must file a request for an extension of the scholarship. The maximum amount of the scholarship is set by th e State Board of Education annually based on the educational costs for attending an eligible Idaho postsecondary educational institution. Scholarship renewals are funded at the current level of the scholarship and receive funding priority. After all rene wals are funded, scholarships are awarded to first -time applicants. First -time applicants receive a score which is a weighted average of financial need (70 percent) and academic eligibility (30 percent). First -time applicants are then ranked according to that score. Awards are given to the highest ranking applicants until all funds are disbursed. Not all recipients receive the same scholarship amount. A recipient will receive less than the maximum amount if they have other financial aid and receipt of the full scholarship would cause their total financial aid package to be greater than the cost of college. The number of students who receive a scholarship depends on the degree to which the Idaho Legislature funds the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship . As funding has increased, the number of students who received the award has increased (see Figure 1). In award year 2014 (FY2015) , 1,421 students were awarded an Opportunity Scholarship. By award year 2016, that number had increased to 3,585 with an additional 403 awards pending. Renewals are given funding priority. Therefore, when a student is awarded an Opportunity Scholarship, funds are encumbered not only in the award year but also in subsequent years. If funding for the Opportunity Scholarship is not increased after a year with a large number of first -time awards , then the number of first -time awards will fall in subsequent years as renewals crowd out the availability to make new awards. Between 2015 and 20 16, the total number of new awards approximately doubled . It is likely that the number of new awards will fall in the 2017 award year as priority is given to renewal awards unless funding for the Opportunity Scholarship is increased.

The student can only receive an award up to the difference between the cost of col lege and all other scholarships and grants. In award year 2016, there were a total of 282 students (158 high school seniors, 116 college undergraduates, and 8 othe rs) who received an award of $0 due to other scholarships and grants. These students can renew their Opportunity Scholarship and be awarded a positive amount in subsequent years. However, they did use a year of eligibility for the scholarship in the year they received an award of $0. The average award across all students who received a positive amount in award year 2016 was $2,897. Figure 2: Amount of Opportunity Scholarship awarded by student status, 2016 award year Evaluating the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship There are several dimensions on which to evaluate the effectiveness of a scholarship. This paper will evaluate the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship using the following questions. \u00b7 First, is the scholarship process functional? Do applicants face unnecessary barriers in the application or renewal process? \u00b7 Second, is the scholarship serving its intended population? The Idaho Opportunity Scholarship is focused on helping economically disadvantaged students who show academic promis e. Is this the population actua lly served ? \u00b7 Third, is the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship effective in changing behavior? Are recipients more likely to go on to college than similar non -recipients? Are recipients more likely to stay in state than similar non- recipients? Are r ecipients are more likely to complete college than similar non - recipients? \u00b7 Fourth, are there any unintended consequences of the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship? Students will lose their Opportunity Scholarship if they do not maintain a 3.0 GPA in college. Does this affect which major they choose or which major they ultimately graduate with? Do students who become ineligible to renew their scholarships still complete college? 158116 831 3821,026 910 $100 - $2,999 $3,000 WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 294 Not all of these questions will be completely answered in this paper due to data limitations. As the data becomes available, all of the above questions will be examined. Data Note Applications for the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship are due in the spring and the recipients are announced in the late spring/early summer. Funds are then disbursed the following academic year. Therefore, one can refer to any particular scholarship year by the year it was awarded or the year in which funds were disbursed. Throughout this paper, we use years to refer to the year the scholarship was awarded. Table 1 shows the relationship between the year of award, the graduating class who would have received the scholarship, and the year when the funds were actually disbursed. Table 1: Relationship of scholarship years Year of Award High School Graduating Class Receiving Award Fiscal year of disbursement Academic year of disbursement Type of Opportunity Scholarship 2013 2013 FY2014 2013 -2014 Old 2014 2014 FY2015 2014 -2015 New 2015 2015 FY2016 2015 -2016 New 2016 2016 FY2017 2016 -2017 New How well does the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship function? This section examines if students face any obstacles in applying for or renewing the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship. In 2015, there were 5,824 initial applications for Idaho scholarships (see Figure 2). About half of those applications were from high school seniors and about half were from college undergraduates. In 2016, there were 4,728 applications - a decrease of approximately 20 percent. Applications from college undergraduates decreased the most with a 33 percent decrease while applications from high school seniors decreased 5 percent. As mentioned earlier, Opportunity Scholarships are awarded based on a score . The score has two components: financial need and academic accomplishment. After each appl ication is scored, they are ranked and scholarships are awarded by this ranking. However, not all applications are actually scored and ranked. Figure 3 shows the share of applications received for the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship that were actually rank ed. Applications would not be ranked if the applicant did not have a qualifying GPA (a GPA of 3.0), if the applicant did not submit a FAFSA, or if the application was otherwise incomplete. As can be seen, 80 percent of applications submitted by high scho ol seniors were ranked while less than 60 percent of those submitted by college undergraduates were ranked in 2015. In 2016, approximately 80 percent of applications submitted by both high school seniors and college undergraduates were ranked. Between 2 015 and 2016, the number of ranked applications fell 7 percent for high school seniors and 5 percent for college undergraduates. WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 305 Figure 2: Number of applications in 2015 and 2016 award years Figure 3: Share of Idaho Opportunity Scholarships that were ranked in 2015 and 2016 award years Figure s 4 and 5 show what was deficient in applications that were not ranked. In 2015 (see Figure 4) , the most common deficiency for both high school seniors and college undergraduates was lack of a FAFSA. Almost 80 percent of undergraduates and 66 percent of high school students who were not ranked in 2015 did not file a FAFSA. The vast majority of those students who did not file a FAFSA did have an eligible GPA. This estimate could be understated as the \"Other\" category includes students who filed the FAFSA after the deadline.5 5 It also includes students who indicated they no longer wished to be considered for the scholarship, renewal students who were initially misclas sified as first time applicants, students who actually did not attend an Idaho high school, homeschool students who did not submit a transcript, or students who were not citizens of the United States. 2,8012,6502,868 1,931 155 147 05001,0001,5002,0002,5003,0003,500 2015 award year 2016 award yearNumber of applications High School Senior College Undergraduate Other 80% 58%79% 82%20% 42%21% 18% 0%20%40%60%80%100% High School Senior College Undergraduate High School Senior College Undergraduate 2015 award year 2016 award yearApplication ranked Application not ranked WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 316 Figure 4: Reasons applications were incomplete for 2015 award year Figure 5: Reasons applications were incomplete for 2016 award year For 2016, we were able to split those who filed a late FAFSA out of the \"Other\" category and include it in the \"FAFSA not filed\" category. In 2016 (see Figure 5), on -time completion of the FAFSA continued to be a roadblock for college undergraduates who otherwise would have likely qualified for the scholarship. Almost two -thirds of the applications that were not ranked were not ranked solely due to a missing or late FAFSA. However, it became less of a roadblock for high school seniors. In 2016, approximately half of the applications that w ere not ranked were not ranked solely due to a missing FAFSA. In 2015, it has been 62 percent. The FAFSA is an important part of the application process. It is the only way in which the State Board can actually verify a student's financial need. Therefore, it is likely it will remain a necessary part of the application. OSBE staff believes completion of the FAFSA will become less of an issue for students as the FAFSA transitions to being based on income from two years ago rather than last year's income. In 2017, students will be able to complete both their application for the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship and their FAFSA during College Application Week. 15%62% 79%20% 21% 0%20%40%60%80%100% High School Senior College Undergraduate 2015 award yearOther including late FAFSA Valid GPA; FAFSA not filed 2016 award yearOther Valid GPA; FAFSA not filed or filed late Invalid GPA; FAFSA filed Invalid GPA; FAFSA not filed or filed late WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 327 In 2016, 29 percent of high school seniors who applied and were not ranked did not have an eligible GPA. The Opportunity Scholarship is based on a student's unweighted GPA. Students may apply without being eligible if they do not properly understand the difference between their unweighted and their weighted GPA. Students must meet several requirements in order to renew . One of the requirements is that they maintain a 3.0 GPA in college. As data becomes available, we will show the share of high school seniors who received the scholarship in award y ear 2015 and did not renew due to the GPA requirement. A student also cannot renew if they have 100 credits and cannot complete their major in two semesters. In the future, we will examine how many students will be affected by this requirement due to the accumulation of dual credits. Above we identified barriers to students who started the application process. There may also exist barriers to students even beginning the application process. It would be extremely difficult to identify barriers to even starting the application process. However, one can e xamine whether or not the applicant pool mirrors the underlying population in order to understand if these barriers (and the barriers identified above) are disproportionately born by certain groups of students. In the future, we will examine them by race/ ethnicity, gender , and school district region in order to understand if there are groups which are under -represented in the ranked applicant pool. In this version, we show preliminary evidence that students from school districts in Regions 4, 5, and 6 ar e under -represented in the ranked applicant pool. Table 2 shows the share of 2015 high school graduates from each region as well as the share of 2016 ranked applications from each region. (This will be updated as data on the number of 2016 graduates from each region becomes available. ) In future work, we will also examine reasons why these regions are under -represented.

Does the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship serve the population it was designed to serve? The Idaho Opportunity Scholarship was designed to help high achieving, low -income students. Thus, there are two main selection criteria - academic achievement and financial need. Figure 6 shows the GPA and EFC6 of those who applied and were ranked for award year 2015 . Those who did not rece ive the scholarship are marked with blue diamonds and those who did receive the scholarship are marked with orange dashes . The recipients all fall into a triangle of the graph due to the weighting proce ss. The weighting process ensures that students with the highest GPAs will qualify with relatively higher EFCs than students with the lowest GPAs. In 2015, students who had a 4.0 were awarded the scholarship if their EFC was around $6,000 or below. Students with an EF C of $0 were not awarded the scholarsh ip unless they had a GPA slightly above 3.2. Figure 7 replicates Figure 6 but for the 2016 award year. For the 2016 award year, there is no triangle demarcating recipients and non- recipients. Due to the increase in funding between FY20 16 and FY2017 , the vast majority of students who qualified for the Opportunity Scholarship in award year 2016 were awarded the Opportunity Scholarship. Students who had a 4.0 GPA were awarded an Opportunity Scholarship as long as their EFC was below the cost of college. A ll students with an EFC below $11,500 who met the other criteria were awarded an Opportunity Scholarship. 7 As can be noted, there are equity discrepancies across the different years of the scholarship due to the changes in funding. In the 2015 award year , there were students with E FCs of $0 who did receive the Opportunity Scholarship while all students with EFCs of $0 were awarded in the 2016 award year. Due to the increase in first -time awards in award year 2016 and the likely increase in renewals in aw ard year 2017, it is likely that there will be first -time applicants in award year 2017 with a $0 EFC who will not receive the Opportunity Scholarship unless funding for the scholarship is increased. 6 In Figures 6 and 7 , all EFCs above $10,000 are reported as $10,000. 7 Some students' EFCs were updated after the March 1 deadline. While these updated EFCs were uploaded into the system, receipt of the scholarship was not affected as receipt of the s cholarship is calculated using EFC as of March 1. WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 349 Figure 6 : EFC and GPA of applicants that were ranked in the 2015 award year Note: Only students ranked using their GPA are included. Not included are 2 students whose status is under review. Figure 7: EFC and GPA of applicants that were ranked in the 2016 award year Note: Only students ranked using their GPA are included. Not included is 1 student whose status is under review. To better understand if the Opportunity Scholarship is serving the intended population, one also needs to examine if the ranked applications are representative of the state. If they are, then the weighting formula will automatically ensure that the students with the most financial need and highest academic achievement receive the scholarship. We discuss our work on this in the previous section. $0$1,000$2,000$3,000$4,000$5,000$6,000$7,000$8,000$9,000$10,000 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4EFC GPADid not receive Did receive $0$1,000$2,000$3,000$4,000$5,000$6,000$7,000$8,000$9,000$10,000 3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4EFC GPAWas not offered Was offered WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB B Page 3510 Is the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship effective at changing behavior? To understand if the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship is effective at changing behavior, we examine several questions. Are recipients of the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship more likely to go on to college in the fall immediately after graduation than similar non -recipients? The Opportunity Scholarship just covers fees at the two -year institutions and covers about half of tuition and fees at the four -year institutions in Idaho . 8 Therefore, even students who receive the s cholarship will still have to have other sources of funds in order to attend college. Are recipients more likely to stay in -state to go to college than similar non- recipients? Do recipients of the Opportunity Scholarship complete college at higher rate t han similar non -recipients? At this stage , we will do a simple comparison of go -on rates for different populations for the first two questions . First, we will compare the go -on rates for all recipients versus the rate for all high school seniors. This will obviously be higher and does not tell us if the Opportunity Scholarship actually changes behavior . For illumination on that point, we will compare the go -on rates for recipients who just barely qualified for the scholarship versus those who just barely did not qualify for the scholarship. Differences in behavior between these two groups is likely due to receipt of the Opportunity Scholarship. We will do this analysis as the necessary data becomes available. We will do similar analysis for the probability a student stays in state. This data is also not yet available. In the long run, we will examine completion rates of those who receive the Opportunity Scholarship versus those who do not. This data will not be available for several years. In the short run, we can examine retention rates of those who received the scholarship versus retention rates of other undergraduates with similar EFCs and GPAs. The complete data for this is also not yet available. Does the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship have unintended effects? While the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship may affect some behavior, there may also be unintended effects. A recent study found that recipients of Georgia's HOPE Scholarship were less likely to graduate with a STEM degree 9 than they would have been without the scholarship. The study concluded t hat the decline came from students who started out in STEM majors but then switched to a non -STEM major before graduation in order to maintain their GPA so they would remain eligible for the scholarship . The same study also found some evidence of high school GPA inflation after the HOPE scholarship was instituted. In this section, we will examine if either of these effects are apparent in Idaho. The data for this analysis is still pending. In this section, we will also examine whether or not students who receive the Opportunity Scholarship and then are not able to renew it graduate from college at the same rate as similar students. This data is also not yet available. Conclusion This analysis is one of the preliminary steps of an evaluation of the Idaho Opportunity Scholarship for award year 2016 . This evaluation will be updated as the necessary data becomes available. 9 Solquist , David L., and John V.

The Statewide Strategic Plan for research will assist in the identification of general research areas that will enhance the economy of Idaho through the collaboration of academia, industry, and/or government. The Research Strategic Plan was completed and approved by the Board in December 2011. The Board then approved an updated plan in 2015. The Board has received annual performance measure reports each year. The plan represents the role Idaho's research universities play in driving innovation, economic development, and enhancing the quality of life in Idaho through national and internationally research programs in strategic areas. The plan identifies areas of strength among Idaho's research universities; research challenges and barriers facing universities; research opportunities Idaho should capitalize upon to further build its research base, and steps for achieving the research vision for Idaho's universities.

The universities and colleges of Idaho's system of higher education understand the need for greater collaboration in order to be competitive in today's global environment. Recognizing the need to focus on and emphasize existing strengths and opportunities in Idaho's research community, t he vice presidents of for research and economic development developed the following statewide strategic plan for research to ensure the greatest potential for achieving a vital and sustainable research base for Idaho. The strategic plan identifies the key research areas (basic, translational and clinical) that will become the focal points for research and economic development through partnering among academia, industry and government in science , technology , and creative activity . Research is fundamental to the mission of a university due to its role in knowledge discovery and in providing new ideas for technology commercialization via patents, copyright, licenses and startup companies. University faculty who engage in research and creative activity are at the leading edge of their respective fields. Research also enhances the national reputation of the faculty and the universities. These faculty and their vibrant research programs attract the best graduate and undergraduate students by providing unique cutting - edge learning experiences in their research laboratories, studios, field sites and classrooms. On the most basic level, and also bolstered through collaborative, interdisciplinary and interprofessional research, such activities research strengthens a university's primary product \u2014 innovative, well -educated students ready to enter a competitive workforce. Research is the foundation of a university's economic development role. The influx of research dollars from external grants and contracts creates new jobs at the university, along WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 5 with the attendant purchases of supplies, services, materials and equipment. The results of the research are new knowledge, new ideas, and new processes, which lead to patents, startup companies , more efficient businesses as well as a highly trained workforce prepared to tackle 21st century challenges. Idah o's research universities have strengths and opportunities for economic development in 1) Energy Systems , 2) Natural Resource Utilization and Conservation, 3) Biosciences Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences , 4) Novel Materials and 5) Software Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity . By focusing collaborative efforts in these areas, the research universities will expand research success by : \u00b7 Helping Idaho institutions focus on their research strengths; \u00b7 Strengthening collaboration among Idaho institutions; \u00b7 Creating research and development opportunities that build relationship s between universities and the private sector; \u00b7 Contributing to the economic development of the State of Idaho; \u00b7 Enhancing learning and professional development through research and scholarly activity - also by promoting interdisciplinary and interprofessional research ; and \u00b7 Build ing and improv ing the research infrastructure of Idaho universities to meet curren t and future research needs. This statewide Strategic Research Plan for Idaho Higher Education is a tool for identifying and attaining quantifiable goals for research and economic growth and success in Idaho.

WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 9 RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES Idaho's research universities have developed statewide strengths in strategic research areas that have great potential to drive future economic growth and success. The criteria used to select these areas include: number of faculty and qualifications; peer - reviewed publications and impact; infrastructure (facilities, equipment, information technology, staff); external grant and contract funding; academic programs; student involvement; potential benefit to the State o f Idaho; and technology transfer activity, including patents, licenses, and startup companies. By focusing collective research efforts and resources in these areas, the universities will be on the most efficient and effective route to research success and state- wide economic development. These high impact areas include 1) Energy Systems , 2) Natural Resource Utilization and Conservation, 3) Biosciences Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences , 4) Novel Materials, and 5) Software Systems Engineering and Cybersecurity. Development. Energy Systems: Energy is a critical driver of any economy. The projected increases in the population of the world and increases in the standard of living will produce severe strains on the ability to meet the demands of the next few decades. In additi on, finite reserves of fossil fuels and pollution from their combustion requires that alternative sources of energy production be developed. The combination of natural resources in Idaho and presence of the Idaho National Laboratory makes energy a natural area of emphasis. Indeed, the three universities with research capabilities already have extensive research projects in this area. The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES) is an example of the significant investment the three Idaho universities , the University of W yoming, and the Idaho National Laboratory have made to develop expertise in nuclear science and engineering and safety , biofuel production from dairy waste materials science and engineering , energy systems design and analysis, fossil carbon conversion, geological systems and applications, geothermal exploration, carbon sequestration, energy policy and cybersecurity , and energy efficient structures environmental and resource sustainability . Intellectual property has already been generated fr om these products and is licensed. Further growth in these areas not only takes advantage of the strong base but strongly supports a positive economic development impact through new markets for new product development Natural Resource Utilization and C onservation: In the broad field of natural resource utilization and conservation, Idaho's universities have expertise in water resources, wildfire management and restoration, agriculture, forestry, recreation, and geophysics and geochemical detection , geog raphical information systems, and monitoring of groundwater pollutants. For example, university geologists, ecologists, and policy experts are collaborating on broad- ranging research projects that examine and predict the impact of climate change on Idaho's water resources. As water is essential to agriculture, recreation, the ecosystem, and human health, the universities have research strength in an area of tremendous societal and economic impact. Agriculture remains an important part of the economy of Idaho. Development of new plant biomic varieties with improved resistance to disease and climate change remain an area of importance as does the development of new feeds for domestic fish production. The often competing WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 10 demands for preservation and exploitation put on the environment require understanding of the various ecosystems in the state and region as well as societal , human health, and economic impacts of policy decisions. Recent national research imperatives, as particularly captured in National Science Foundation's Innovation at the Nexus of Food, Energy, and Water Systems (INFEWS) foundation- wide program and the Department of Energy's report Water -Energy Nexus: Challenges and Opportunities increasingly require multi- sectoral, multi -disciplinary approaches to problems in natural resource utilization and conservation. The depth and breadth of relevant research expertise in the biophysical, rural health and social science fields within Idaho's universities underscores an opportunity that a national emphasis on food, energy, and water security provides. Provided that enhanced coordination and collaboration between Idaho's universities can be successfully executed, we are particularly well -placed to exhibit national and international leadership at the nexus of food, energy, water system research. The future economic success of the state will rely on a deep understanding of these processes. Biosciences Biomedical and Healthcare Sciences : Idaho's universities have well - established research programs in selected areas of biosciencesbi ological and biomedical sciences. University microbiologists and informatics experts, for example, study real -time change in pathogenic microorganisms that enable them to become resistant to drugs and chemical toxins thus resulting in worsening human disease and mortality rates. These effects are not restricted to humans, domestic and wild animals as well as food plants and trees are experiencing the same phenomena. Also, weeds are becoming resistant to herbicides. These phenomena are having a significant negative impact on Idaho's agric ulture and forests. Further stress is being put on these important commercial sectors through climate variability. Research in these areas is critical for preserving important economic sectors of Idaho's economy while addressing future global needs. The public health infrastructure in rural Idaho is not well understood but is potentially the most fragile aspect of the state's health care system. The rural environment, especially typical in Idaho where agriculture, manufacturing, and fishing are important or dominant parts of the economy, presents extraordinary threats to health. Agriculture brings the use of pesticides and herbicides as well as heavy and potentially dangerous machinery. Manufacturing - depending on the type - is a consistently hazardous industry, and employees involved in fishing and forestry are at much higher risks of trauma. Healthcare and in particular a focus on rural health, provides significant opportunit ies for economic development in Idaho. Partnerships with private entities in th e healthcare industry, funding though the National Institutes of Health and other federal agencies utilize the natural laboratory of Idaho's rural population. Idaho's universities' contributions towards this emerging area of scholarship will add to the global competitiveness of the United States and the State. Novel Materials: The global materials industry is worth an estimated $550 billion, conservatively. Materials revolutionize our lives by offering advanced performance and new possibilities for design and usage. For example, the market for biocompatible materials has grown from a few to $60B in the past decade. Market size is growing for materials in emerging areas such photonic materials, electronic and dielectric materials, functional coatings, and g reen materials. Materials research in Idaho is conducted by a WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 11 wide range of scientists in diverse fields. Across the state, faculty members in Biology, Chemistry, Geosciences, Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering , Nuclear Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering conduct research on improving and developing new materials. Current materials researchers in Idaho cover a broad spectrum of specializations, including semiconductor device reliability, microelectronic packaging, shape memory alloys, DNA machinery, environmental degradation, materials for extreme environments, biomaterials and bio- machinery, materials characterization, and materials modeling. Nanoscale materials and devices, functional materials and their uses and materials for energy applications are a focus of research throughout the state. These areas of research are highly synergistic with local industries and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Access to materials characterization equipment and processing laboratories has resulted in collaborations with small businesses and start -up companies. Software DevelopmentSystems Engineering and Cybersecurity : Device control and , information management , and cybersecurity are an essential part of 21st century life and, therefore, are an important part of educational requirements. For instance, large amounts of sensitive data are collected, processed, and stored electronically but must be accessed and moved in order to have any impact. In fact, many systems are co mputer controlled through networks. These include such things as the electric transmission grid and transportation in major cities. The universities are beginning to develop research expertise in software development and data management lifecycle design and operations and secure and dependable system design and operations. This area provides a significant area of opportunity for positive economic development impact in Idaho, partnerships with the Idaho National Laboratory, and in as well as for improving the global competitiveness of the United States. There are already a significant number of firms in Idaho whose interests are in software development for device control, information management and processing. In addition, many of the major research projects being undertaken in the region by various state and federal agencies as well as the universities require the handling of significant amounts of data in a secure and dependable fashion. Each university has some expertise in this area but not a critical mass. Currently, research funding in the universities from private and governmental sources is limited by the number of qualified personnel. In addition, within Idaho there is a high demand for graduates at all levels in computer science, hence workforce development i n these areas should be a matter of urgency . EXTERNAL FACTORS: IDAHO RESEARCH ADVANTAGES, THREATS, AND CHALLENGES There are unique advantages and challenges to research in Idaho. This document seeks to provide guidance on building upon the advantages present in Idaho and address the challenges through the goals in this strategic plan. Research Advantages WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 12 The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) and the Center for Advanced Energy Studies: Idaho is fortunate to be home to the Idaho National Laboratory, one of only 20 17 U.S. Department of Energy national laboratories in the U.S. The INL's unique history and expertise in nuclear energy, environmental sciences and engineering, alternative for ms of energy, and biological and geological sciences and related fields provides an excellent opportunity for research collaboration with Idaho's university faculty in the sciences, engineering, business and other fields. The Center for Advanced Energy Studies (CAES), established at the request of the U.S. Department of Energy, is a public -private partnership that includes Idaho's research universities (-Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho )-, the University of Wyom ing, and the Battelle Energy Alliance (BEA), which manages the INL. The CAES partners work together to create unique educational and research opportunities that blend the talents and capabilities of Idaho's universities and the INL. A 55,000 square- foot re search facility in Idaho Falls supports the CAES energy mission with laboratory space and equipment for students, faculty, and INL staff in collaborative research projects. The State of Idaho invested invest s $3.2M per year in direct support of the three Idaho research universities during FY09 and FY10. During these first two years, the CAES partners won $24M in external support for CAES research that has contributed to both scientific advances and economic development in the state and region . Natural Re sources: Idaho's beautiful natural resources are well known to fishermen, hunters, skiers, and other outdoor enthusiasts. Through its rivers, forests, wildlife, geological formations, and rangelands, Idaho itself is a unique natural laboratory for geological, ecological, and forestry studies. Idaho is home to some of the largest tracts of remote wilderness in the lower 48 states. In addition, the proximity of Yellowstone National Park and the Great Salt Lake provide additional one of a kind opportunities for ecology and geology research. Small Population: Idaho's relatively small population of 1. 4 6 million people enables every group in the state to be included in research surveys, providing more accurate information than a sampling of only some groups. Intrastate Networks: The existing networks within the state, including agricultural extension services and rural health networks, provide a foundation for collecting research data from across the state, and rapidly implementing new policies and practices as a result of research discoveries. Research ThreatsChallenges The goals set forth in this strategic plan are specifically designed to address challenges in Idaho. These challenges are identified below and include a description of the challenge and the goal from this strategic plan that addresses that specific challe nge. WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 13 Economy: The current economic recession is the most severe downturn most of us have seen in our lifetimes. The immediate effects of this recession on university research are state- wide budget cuts, with results that include hiring freezes, loss of university faculty and staff, higher teaching loads for faculty (with correspondingly less time for research), and delayed improvements in research infrastructure, including major equipment. However, it is not only the current recession which threatens Idaho university research. Idaho has relatively few industries, and seems to attract fewer new companies and industries than other states. When one major sector suffers, as agriculture is at the present time, the entire state suffers. As state institutions, the research universities suffer. Over time, a relatively slow state economy leads to at least two problems: 1) recruitment and retention of faculty, who go to institutions offering higher salaries, more startup money, and better infrastructure; and 2) aging infrastructure, keeping Idaho researchers behind their national peers in terms of having the most up- to-date facilities and equipment. Without proper infrastructure, Idaho research faculty is at a distinct disadvantage in competing with peers across the nation for federal grants. Lack of Coordination Among Universities In Advancing Research and Economic Development (technology transfer): By and large the research universities have not coordinated and shared their technology transfer and economic development activities among themselves. This not only decreases each university's competitiveness at the national and state level but also increases the costs for achieving a particular goal. There is some redundancy in programs, services and infrastructure between the universities. This duplication both limits the success that any one university can achieve and increases the cost. Historical Competition Between Universities: One of the greatest problems with growing the research and economic development enterprise within the Idaho university arena has been the competitiveness between research universities. This problem existed at all levels within the universities themselves, extended through university administration to the state level, and was even prevalent in the press. While competition between the universities is to be expected when all are competing for a finite pot of money within the state and is even healthy at some level, the level of competition was counterproductive. The real competition that Idaho universities face is other universities in the United States when it comes to research dollars and attracting faculty and students. Economic development is also not a competition between the state universities but rather a competition with other states. Goal 1 is designed to remedy these two challenges by \"increas(ing) research at, and collaboration among Idaho universities and colleges to advance research strengths and opportunities pertaining to critical issues in Idaho, while also providing a vision for national and global impact.\" Competition from Other Universities: In research, university faculty competes nationally for grant funds from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation, WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 14 Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of HealthDepart ment of Health and Human Services . Many other states' universities are well ahead of Idaho's universities in terms of state funding per student, patent royalty income, endowments, etc., and are able to move ahead at a faster pace, leaving Idaho universities further behind as time goes on. Goals 1 and 2 are designed to make Idaho's research universities more competitive nationally and globally through collaboration with each other and by \"(strengthening) the relationship between state universities and the private sector.\" University Culture: Each of Idaho's research universities aspires to greater levels of achievement in research and creative activity, yet many faculty at each of the universities are not fully engaged on a national level in their respective fields. This is changing for the better under new leadership and with new research -active faculty hires at each institution, but these cultural differences remain, resulting in discomfort with change aimed at making the universities more nationally competitive. While Goal 1 urges the researchers at Idaho's universities to keep a national and global vision for their research, Goal 4 aims to enhance t he research capabilities of faculty by \"(enhancing) learning and professional development.\" Private Sector Support: Idaho has very little high- technology industry within its borders. This reduces the potential for developing an applied research initiat ive within the universities that, in many states, provides one important arm of economic development and technology transfer. This also means that it is much harder to develop those private/public partnerships that provide the universities with additional capital to construct research are technology transfer facilities. The private sector plays a critical role in research. Goal 2 states that we will \"create research and development opportunities that strengthen the relationship between state universities and the private sector.\" Fragmented Economic Development Initiatives: There are seemingly too many economic development initiatives in Idaho and they are not well coordinated. It is imperative that state, university, and community initiatives work together toward common and agreed to goals. As it is, little progress is being made towards developing an economic strategy for the state that includes the research universities and little money has been secured to drive the economic development process. In fact, it is not uncommon to find that different entities in Idaho are competing against each other. Positive economic impact is the result of well -organized and collaborative research. It requires strategic planning and execution. Goal 3 indicates that Idaho's research universities focus on \"(contributing) to the positive economic impact of the State of Idaho.\" WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 15 Research Challenges Attraction and Retention of Faculty and Students: The ability to attract and retain faculty who contribute to the research enterprise is critically dependent on nationally - competitive salaries, the quality of the student body, and the condition of the research and support facilities and the availability of faculty with related interests. Declining state investment in the research universities which results in non- competitive salaries, non- existent or below average raises, decaying or inadequate infrastructure and lack of administrative support discourages top-tier faculty from applying for and accepting open positions and encourages the best faculty to leave. Similarly, non- competitive graduate student stipends keep the best students from accepting positions in the Idaho universities. Vastness of State and Distances Between Schools: Although the distances between the research universities is not much different from those in other western states, the topography of Idaho increases the time and cost required for travel well beyond those experienced in other states. This fact discourages collaborations between faculty members and administrators at the different research universities as well as between universities and other entities within Idaho. Although video conferencing can alleviate this problem, ther e is limited capability at each university. There is also the continuing problem of finding funds to pay for the necessary connectivity between the universities as well as to the world outside of Idaho. Aging Infrastructure: Modern research requires access to sophisticated and precision instrumentation which, in turn, requires a stable and controlled environment in order to operate. The three research universities in Idaho have limited numbers of these facilities or even space that could be economically converted into modern laboratory space. At present all laboratory space\u2014 modern or otherwise\u2014is occupied. This means that there is little room for growing the research enterprise and certainly no space to accommodate new faculty or major new projects. Data Issues: There is very little long -term, quality data available on the research enterprise or economic development. The data that exists are scattered among various entities in a variety of formats thus make it hard to centralize and use. Furthermore, there is no one entity responsible for collecting, analyzing and dispersing it. This is also true for many of the sectors that will strongly influence the future economic impact of Idaho. While there are large amounts of data that have been collected on watersheds, forests and agricultural operations and the environment \u2014to name a few \u2014they are distributed across a number of agencies and individuals within those agencies. Worse yet, much of this information is lost every time a researcher retires. Priva te Sector Support: Idaho has very little high- technology industry within its borders. This reduces the potential for developing an applied research initiative within the universities that, in many states, provides one important arm of economic development and technology transfer. This also means that it is much harder to develop those private/public partnerships that provide the universities with additional capital to construct research are technology transfer facilities. WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 16 Fragmented Economic Development Initiatives: There are seemingly too many economic development initiatives in Idaho and they are not well coordinated. It is imperative that state, university, and community initiatives work together toward common and agreed to goals. As it is, little progress is being made towards developing an economic strategy for the state that includes the research universities and little money has been secured to drive the economic development process. In fact, it is not uncommon to find that different entities in Idaho are competing against each other. Lack of Coordination Among Universities In Advancing Research and Economic Development (technology transfer): By and large the research universities have not coordinated and shared their technology transfer and economic development activities among themselves. This not only decreases each university's competitiveness at the national and state level but also increases the costs for achieving a particular goal. There is some redundancy in programs, services and infrastructure between the universities. This duplication both limits the success that any one university can achieve and increases the cost. Historical Competition Between Universities: One of the greatest problems with growing the research and economic development enterprise within the Idaho university arena has been the competitiveness between research universities.

While competition between the universities is to be expected when all are competing for a finite pot of money within the state and is even healthy at some level, the level of competition was counterproductive. The real competition that Idaho universities face is other universities in the United States when it comes to research dollars and attracting faculty and students. Economic development is also not a competition between the state universities but rather a competitio n with other states. Lack of National and International Competitiveness: While each Idaho research university has faculty members that can successfully compete on the national and international scene for research funds, no one university has the necessary reputation, breadth of faculty expertise or facilities to compete for the large projects that are necessary to establish a national or international reputation and substantially grow its research funding. This becomes less relevant if the universities w ork together and better coordinate their research activities. It is more than simply agreeing to cooperate on developing projects; it must extend to each university developing complementary research programs so that, taken together, they can successfully compete within any university in the country in selected areas. Lack of Diversity: The population of faculty, staff and students at each of the three research universities, like that of the State, is fairly homogeneous. This lack of diversity \u2014 be it cultural, socio -economic or ethnic \u2014hurts the universities and surrounding communities in several different ways. First, it makes recruitment of students, faculty and staff from under -represented groups more difficult. Second, it is noted on accreditation WORK SESSION DECEMBER 14, 2016 WORK SESSION - PPGA TAB C Page 17 reports and, as such, is a negative reflection on the institution. Finally, it limits the competitiveness of the university in several federal agencies where plans for including under -represented groups in the program are a key element of the proposal. Conclusion This statewide Strategic Research Plan for Idaho Higher Education provides a framework to mitigate these external challenges and help Idaho institutions continue to focus on their research strengths. Overcoming the challenges discussed in this document will require enhanced cooperation between the functional groups at each Idaho university, fueled by a desire to work together towards the common goal of improving Idaho's economy for future generations.

June 2008 Board approved renewal of contract with Boise City Police Department to continue to provide campus law enforcement services through September 2012. June 2012 Board approved renewal of contract with Boise City Police Department to continue to provide campus law enforcement services through September 2016. June 2014 Board approved a revision of contract with Boise City Police Department to increase the cost of the contract through September 2016. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section V.I.3.a Section 67-9225, Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Since October 2004, Boise State University (BSU) has contracted with the Boise City Police Department (\"BPD\") to provide law enforcement services on campus. In June 2014, the Board approved a revised contract that expired in September 2016. A three-month extension to the contract was signed in September 2016 that will expire at the end of December 2016. BSU wishes to enter into an agreement with BPD for continued services for three and three-quarters additional years with an additiona l two one-year renewal options, through 2021. The City of Boise has given preliminary approval for the proposed agreement, subject to final City Council action. The proposed contract term is for three years beginning January 1, 2017, through September 30, 2019 . Due to the unique nature of campus law enforcement services, it is important for BSU to continue the mutually beneficial relationship with its service provider. Therefore, provided that the contract costs remain competitive and the service exceptional, BSU would like to continue its arrangement with BPD in lieu of seeking a new service provider through the competitive bid process. IMPACT CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 2 In addition to the three year contract cost, BSU will pay $8,762 to the City of Boise to represent the increase in cost not captured in the three month extension of the previous contract pertaining to October 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Annual costs are as follows: Jan. 2017-Sept. 2017 $ 902,530 Extension Cost for Oct. 1 - Dec. 31 $ 8,762 Oct. 2017 - Sept. 2018 $1,239,474 Oct. 2018 - Sept. 2019 $1,276,658 Total $3,427,424 Possible extensions, at Boise State's election: Oct. 2019 - Sept. 2020 $1,314,958 Oct. 2020 - Sept. 2021 $1,354,407 This cost represents an average annual increase of three percent. The increase is intended to support the cost increases of maintaining a law enforcement unit on campus with specialized training and personnel.

Recognizing the University responsibility to respond promptly and effectively to protect the campus community from and investigate hate crimes, violent crimes, or crimes of gender based or sexual violence, and the University's urgent need to receive information that affects the campus students, faculty, and staff safety, BPD will disclose LE Records, information and investigatory records to University officials as soon as practicable and under confidential stamp. In instances where immediate sharing of records is not possible, BPD will active ly and promptly communicate with University Public Safety or Title IX officials to ensure the safety of the campus community, including, if known, the name and description of the victim and perpetrator, a description of the incident, including location and date and time, and any DR or other report number assigned to the police incident report documenting the investigation being conducted. Pending the release of records, th e BPD Lieutenant or his/her designee assigned to the University will verbally communicate with the Executive Director of the Department of Public Safety or the University Title IX Representative with as much information as is possible to aid and support the University in its investigation. b. Routing for Screening Decisions. LE Records, DRs or other reports that contain evidence meeting the elements of hate crimes, violent crimes, and crimes of gender based or sexual violence alleged to have occurred on the Main Campus or University-owned, controlled or maintained buildings and properties within the Boise Police jurisdiction areas will be routed to the Ada County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, Boise City Attorney's Office, or other special prosecutor as assigned, for a charging or \"screening\" decision unless the relevant prosecuting agency has been consulted and has indicated otherwise. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 8 c. LE Records. LE Records related to University business, regardless of format, will be freely shared with the Unversity and may be utilized for any lawful purpose, including but not limited to Title IX, Clery Act, Student Conduct, or Human Resource disciplinary proceedings, but will not be released by the University to any outside party, nor will LE Records created and maintained by BPD be held by the Univers ity as a record of the University. LE Records are not records belonging to the University and must be requested by the public through the Boise Police Department. BPD is the custodian of LE Records it produces and any persons requesting LE Records will be referred to BPD to submit a public record request. 10. Access to Education Records by BPD and Information Sharing. a. BPD officers and staff assigned to University: i. perform an essential institutional service and function for which the University would otherwise use employees; ii. are designated as \"school officials;\" iii. possess a \"legitimate educational interest\" in student educational records.

CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 1 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 9 2. BPD officers participating in the CARE Team functions may only use Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from Education Records to conduct threat assessments. For the sake of clarity and the avoidance of doubt, a BPD officer serving on the CARE Team may not share any PII with the Police Department from a student's education records to which he or she was privy to as a member of the CARE Team. 3. A BPD officer may disclose PII from a student's education records, on behalf of the University, to appropriate officials where a CARE Team determination finds that a health or safety emergency exists. See \u00a7\u00a7 99.31(a)(10) and 99.36. vi. By allowing BPD officers, as school officials, to have appropriate access to a student's Education Rec ords, BPD and University can work cooperatively to detect warning signs and determine whether a particular student poses a risk or a threat to him/herself and/or the campus community. To allow this communication to occur, both BPD and University must comply with the confidentiality requirements of FERPA for education records as set forth above. 11.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section V.I.5.b. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION ISU requests Board authorization to negotiate and execute a lease with McDonald's. McDonald's is reinvesting in their restaurant located near ISU's campus in Pocatello, ID. As part of this rebuild, McDonald's would like to expand their drive-thru lanes onto ISU property located adjacent to their parcel of land. The adjacent parcel owned by ISU is currently a vacant lot with no current economic use. The proposed lease agreement has been reviewed by the Division of Public Works (DPW) and agreed to by McDonald's and is attached for reference. ISU and McDonald's have conducted separate appraisals of ISU's parcel to determine the lease amount presented in the proposed lease agreement. IMPACT The proposed lease terms allow McDonald's to use this vacant lot for at least ten years with the option to extend their use for another ten or more years. ISU has no immediate use for this lot and would recognize income in the amount of roughly $33,000 per year.

Federal Law requires that most group plans (including this plan) give \"qualified beneficiaries '' the opportunity to continue their health care coverage when there is a \"qualifying event\" that would result in a loss of coverage uuder an employer's plan. Depending on the type of qualifying event, \"qualified beneficiaries\" can include the employee (or retired employee) covered under the group health plan, the covered employee 's spouse, and dependent children of the covered employee. Continuation coverage is the same coverage tbat the Plan gives to other participants or beneficiaries under the Plan who are not receiving continuation coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who elects continuation coverage will have the same rights under the Plan as other patticipants or beneficiaries covered under the Plan including open enrollment and special emollrnen t _ rights. How long will continuation coverage last? In the case of a loss of coverage due to end of employment or reduction in hours of employment, coverage may be continued for up to a total of 18 months. In the case of losses of coverage due to an employee's death, divorce or legal separation, the employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits or a dependent child ceasing to be a dependent under the terms of the plan, coverage may be continued for up to a total of36 months. When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours of employment, and the employee became entitled to Medicare benefits less than 18 months before the qualifyin g event, COBRA continuation cove1age for the qualified beneficiaries other than the employee lasts until 36 months after the date of Medicare entitlement. Continuation coverage will be terminated before tbe end of the maximum period if: * any required premium is not paid in full on time, * a qualified beneficiary becomes covered, after electing continuation coverage, under another group health plan that does not impose any pre-existing condition exclusion for a pre-exist ing condition of the qualified beneficiary, (note: there are limitations on plans' imposing a pre-existi ng condition exclusion and such exclusions will become prohibited beginning in 2014 under the Affordable Care Act.), *a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both) after electing continuation coverage, or * the employer ceases to provide any group health plan for it's employees. Continuation coverage may also be terminated for any reason the Plan would temlinate coverage of a participant or beneficiary not receiving continuation coverage (such as fraud). Special Rules for Health Ca1\u00b7c Reimburs ement Accounts (HCRA) COBRA continuation coverage under a HCRA (health care reimbursement account) will only be offered to you if you had previously elected and have under spent your account. You have under spent your account if the annual limit elected by you, reduced by reimbursements up to the time of the qualifYin g event, is equal to or more than the amount of the premiums due for the remainder of the year in which the qualifying event occurred. If elected, COBRA coverage for HCRA will be on an after-tax basis and will only last until the end of the year in which the qualifying event occmTed. No extension of COBRA continuation coverage beyond the end of the year is available for HCRA. How can you extend the length of COBRA continuation coverage? If you elect continuation coverage, an extension of the maximum period of coverage may be available if a qualified beneficiary is disabled or a second qualifying event occurs. You must notify of a disability or a second qualifying event in Page 5 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 109order to extend the period of continuation coverage. Failure to provide Dotice of a disability or second qualifyin g event may affect the right to extend the period of continuation coverage. Disability An 11-month extension of coverage may be available if any of the qualified beneficiaries is determined by the Social Security Administration (SSA) to be disabled. The disability has to have stru\"ted at some time before the 60th day of COBRA continuation coverage and must last at least until the end of the 18-month period of continuation coverage. Each qualified beneficiary who has elected continuation coverage will be entitled to the 11-month disability extension if one of them qualifies. If the qualified beneficiary is determined by SSA to no longer be disabled, you must notify the Plan of that fact within 30 days after SSA's determination. The qualified bene:ficiruy must be continuously disabled. The extension will end 30 days after the person is no longer determined to be disabled, at the end of the 29 months from the qualifying event or when the disabled qualified beneficiru\u00b7y subsequent ly becomes covered under Medicare . To apply for the disability extension, the followillg infonnation must be sent to the Plan Administrator: * A written request for the extension, and *A copy of the Social Security Administration (SSA)Awards Determination Letter, noting the date of the disability determination . Tbis request must be mailed withill 60 days after receiving the determin ation from SSA and before the end of the 18-montb period. (If you had the SSA determination letter prior to receiving your COBRA election fmm, a copy of the determination letter must be mailed to the Plan Adminisb\"ator witbin 60 days from the date of your election or 60 days from your COBRA effective date, whichever is later, in order to apply for the extension. If both the criteria are not met, the right to the extension ends. You must provide this written request along with a copy of the SSA Determination letter to: 1-800-646-6174 Second Qualifying Event An 18-montb extension of coverage will be available to spouses and dependent children who elect continuation coverage if a second qualifying event occurs during the first 18 months of continuation coverage. The maximum amount of continuation coverage available when a second qualifying event occurs is 36 months. Such second qualifying events may include the death of a covered employee, divorce or separation from the covered employee, the covered employee becoming entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both), or a dependent cbild ceasing to be eligible for coverage as a dependent under the Plan. These events can be a second qualifying event only if they wou ld have caused the qualified beneficiary to lose coverage under the Plan if the first qualifying event had 110t occurred. You must notify the Plan within 60 days after any second qualifying event occurs if you want to extend your continuation coverage. You must provide this notice to: 1-800-646-6174 PA 15220 The written notification to the Plan Administrator should include: * The employee's name and social secw-ity number; Page 6 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 110* The qualifYing event that has occurred; *Any written documentation that is relative to the qualifying event (i.e. divorce decree, death certificate); *A phone number where you may be contacted by the Plan Adminstrator should there be any questions; and *The signature of the person sending the written notification. How can you elect COBRA continuation coverage? To elect continuation coverage, you must complete the Election Fonn and furnish it according to the directions on the fonn. Each beneficiary bas a separate right to elect continuation coverage. For example, the employee's spouse may elect continuation coverage even if the employee does not. Continuation coverage may be elected for only one, several, or for all dependent chj}dren who are qualified beneficiaries. A parent may elect to continue coverage on behalf of any dependent children. The employee or the employee's spouse can elect continuation coverage on behalf of all of the qualified beneficiaries. In considering whether to elect continuation coverage, you should take into account that you have special emollrnent rights under federal law. You have the right to request special emollrnent in another group health plan for which you are otherwise e.ligible (such as a plan sponsored by your spouse's employer) within 30 days aftex your group health coverage ends beca11se of the qualifying event listed above. You will also have the same special emollrnent right at the end of continuation coverage if you get continuation coverage for the maximum amount available to you. How much does COBRA continuation coverage cost? Generally, each qualified beneficiary may be required to pay the entire cost of continuation coverage. The amount a qualified beneficiary may be required to pay may not exceed 102 percent (or, in the case of an extension of continuation coverage due to a disability, 150 percent) of the cost to the group health plan (including both employer and employee cont1ibutions) for coverage of a similarly situated plan participant or beneficiary who. is\u00b7 not receiving continuation coverage. The required payment for each continuation coverage period for each option is described in this notice. When and how must payment for COBRA continuation coverage be made? First payment foi\u00b7 continuation coverage If you elect continuation coverage, you do not have to send any payment for continuation coverage with the Election Fonn. Your benefits will only be activated upon receipt of payment, retroactive to your effective date. Sec Note*. You must make your first payment for continuation coverage not later than 45 days after the date of your election. (This is the date the Election Notice is post-marked, if mailed). If you do not make your first payment for continuation coverage, in full, not later than 45 days after tbe date of your election, you will lose all continuation coverage rights under the Plan. You are responsible for making sure that the amount of your first payment is correct. You may contact to confirm the correct amount of your first payment. Note*: Your coverage(s) will not he reinstated until receipt and processing of the initial premium payment. Once the COBRA Service Center has received yom\u00b7 initial premium payment, your insurance carrier(s) will be notified to reinstate your benefits. Please allow for up to 15 business days (from when the COBRA Service Center processes your initial premium) for the insura'J!CC carrier(s) to reinstate your benefits. If you have incurred cJailns prior to the reinstatement of your benefits, you should contact your insm\u00b7ance carrier at the number on the back of your identification card to request that your claims be reprocessed, as coverage under COBRA, if not waived, is retroactive to the date you lost benefits under the active plan. Periodic payments for continuation coverage After you make yom first payment for continuation coverage, you will be required to make periodic payments for each subsequent coverage period. The amotmt due for each coverage period for each qualified beneficiary is shown in this notice. ~age 7 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 111The periodic payments for continuation coverage are due on the first day of the month for which coverage is provided. If you make a periodic payment on or before the fust day of the coverage period to which it applies, your coverage under the Plan will continue for that coverage period without any break. The Plan will send periodic notices of payments due for these coverage petiods as a courtesy. Grace periods for periodic payments Although periodic payments are due on the dates shown above, you wm be given a grace period of 30 days after the fiTst day of the coverage period to make each periodic payment. Your continuation coverage will be provided for each coverage period as long as payment in full for that coverage period is made before the end of the grace period for that payment. If you fail to make a periodic payment in full before the end of the grace period for that coverage petiod, you will lose all rights to continuation coverage under the Plan.

CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 117COBRA Initial Notification Member Name Street Address City, State Zip Code Dear Member Name: INITIAL NOTIFICATION OF COBRA RIGHTS This notice is intended to summarize your rights and obligations under the group health continuation coverage provisions of COBRA You and your family should take the time to read this notice carefully. Should you qualify for COBRA coverage in the future the University of Idaho Benefit Center will send you the appropriate notification. The right to COBRA continuation coverage was created by a federal law, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA). COBRA continuation coverage can become available to you when you would otherwise lose your group health coverage. It can also become available to other members of your family who are covered under the Plan when they would otherwise lose their group health coverage. What is COBRA Continuation Coverage? COBRA continuation coverage is a continuation of Plan coverage when coverage would otherwise end because of a life event known as a \"qualifying event.\" Specific qualifying events are listed later in this notice. After a qualifying event, COBRA continuation coverage must be offered to each person who is a \"qualified beneficiary.\" You, your spouse, and your dependent children could become qualified beneficiaries if coverage under the Plan is lost because of the qualifying event. Under the Plan, qualified beneficiaries who elect COBRA continuation coverage must pay for COBRA continuation coverage. If you are an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because either one of the following qualifying events happens: Your hours of employment are reduced, or Your employment ends for any reason other than your gross misconduct. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 118COBRA Initial Notification If you are the spouse of an employee, you will become a qualified beneficiary if you lose your coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: Your spouse dies; Your spouse's hours of employment are reduced; Your spouse's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; Your spouse becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (under Part A, Part B, or both); or You become divorced or legally separated from your spouse. Your dependent children will become qualified beneficiaries if they lose coverage under the Plan because any of the following qualifying events happens: The parent-employee dies; The parent-employee's .hours of employmen t are reduced; The parent-employee's employment ends for any reason other than his or her gross misconduct; The parent-employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits (Part A, Part B, or both); The parents become divorced or legally separated; or The child stops being eligible for coverage under the plan as a \"dependent child.'' Sometimes, filing a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code can be a qualifying event. If a proceeding in bankruptcy is filed with respect to the University of Idaho, and that bankruptcy results in the loss of coverage of any retired employee covered under the plan, the retired employee will become a qualified beneficiary with respect to the bankruptcy. The retired employee's spouse, surviving spouse, and dependel)t children will also become qualified beneficiaries if bankruptcy results in the loss of their coverage under the Plan. YOUR NOTICE OBLIGATIONS Under the law, the employee or a family member has 60 days from {1) the date of the event or (2) the date on which coverage would be lost, whichever is later, to inform the Plan Administrator of the employee's divorce or legal separation, or of the employee's child losing dependent status under the University of Idaho plan. You must provide writlen notification to the University of Idaho Benefit Center of the qualifying event within 60 days. If you or your spouse or dependent child fails to provide this notice to the Plan Administrator during this 60-day notice period, any spouse or dependent child who loses coverage will NOT be offered the option to elect continuation of coverage. TO ELECT COVERAGE When the Plan Administrator is notified that one of these events has happened, the University of Idaho Benefit Center will in turn notify you that you have the right to choose COBRA continuation coverage. The employee and spouse have independent election rights. Under the law, you have 60 days from either (1) the date coverage is lost under the employer sponsored group health plan or (2) the date of the notice, whichever is later, to elect continuation coverage. There is no extension of the election period. If you do not elect continuation coverage within this election period, then your rights to continue group health coverage will end. If you choose continuation coverage and pay the applicable premium, as of the time coverage is being provided, is identical to the coverage provided under the plan to similarly situated active employees or family members. If the University of Idaho changes or ends group health coverage for similarly situated active employees, your coverage will CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 119COBRA Initial Notification also change or end. Ordinarily, the continuation coverage that is offered will be the same coverage that you, your spouse or dependent children had on the day before the qualifying event. Therefore, an employee, spouse or dependent child who is not covered under the Plan on the day before the qualifying event generally is not entitled to COBRA coverage except, for example, when there is no coverage because it was eliminated in anticipation of a qualifying event such as divorce. If the coverage is modified for similarly-situated employees or their spouses or dependent children, then COBRA coverage will be modified in the same way. If at that time the University of Idaho maintains more than one group health plan (or offers a choice of separate benefit packages under a single plan), you (or your spouse or dependent children) may elect COBRA coverage under one or more of those plans (or separate benefit packages) in which you have coverage. For example, if you were covered under three separate benefits (e.g., a medical plan, a dental plan, and a vision plan)\u00b7, you could elect COBRA coverage under the medical plan and decline coverage under either or both of the dental and vision plans. But if at that time the University of Idaho maintains one consolidated group health plan (for example, one that provides medical, dental, and vision benefits under a single plan), you must elect or decline COBRA coverage for the plan as a whole. DURATION OF COBRA COVERAGE Termination or Reduction in Hours. If group health coverage was lost because of a termination of employment (other than for reasons of gross misconduct) or a reduction in work hours, the continuation coverage period is 18 months from the date of the qualifying event, if elected. Employees, Spouses or Dependents with Disabilities . The 18 months of continuation coverage can be extended to 29 months if the Social Security Administration determines that the employee, spouse or dependent child was disabled on the date of the qualifying event according to Title II (Old Age SuNivors and Disability Insurance) or XVI (Supplemental Security Income) of the Social Security Act. Disabilities that occur after the qualifying event do not meet the criteria for the extended COBRA coverage period. The employee, spouse or dependent must obtain the disability determination from the Social Security Administration and notify the Plan Administrator of the result within 60 days of the date of disability determination and before the close of the initial 18-month period. The employee, spouse or dependent has 30 days to notify the Plan Administrator from the date of a final determination that he or she is no longer disabled. Multiple Events. The 18-month continuation period can also be extended, if during the 18 months of continuation coverage, a second event takes place (divorce, legal separation, death, Medicare entitlement, or a dependent child ceasing to be a dependent). If this happens, the 18 months of continuation coverage will be extended to 36 months from the date of the original qualifying event. Upon the occurrence of a second event, it is the employee's 1 spouse's or dependent's responsibility to notify the Plan Administrator within 60 days of the event and within the original18- month COBRA period. COBRA coverage does not last beyond 36 months from the original qualifying event, no matter how many events occur. Other Qualifying Events. If group health coverage was lost because of the death of the employee, divorce, legal separation, Medicare entitlement, or a dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child under the University of Idaho sponsored group health plan, then the continuation coverage period is 36 months from the date of the qualifying event, if elected. COBRA CANCELLAT ION The law provides that continuation coverage may be cut short for any of the following reasons: CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 120COBRA Initial Notification The University of Idaho no longer provides group health coverage to any of its employees The premium for continuation coverage is not paid in a timely manner The employee, spouse or dependent child becomes covered, after the date he or she elects COBRA continuation coverage, under another group health plan that does not contain any .exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition he or she may have The employee or spouse becomes entitled to Medicare The employee, spouse or dependent child extended continuation coverage to ?9 months due to a Social Security disability and a final determination has been made that he or she is no longer disabled The employee, spouse or dependent child notifies the University of Idaho Benefit Center that they wish to cancel continuation coverage.

Your Medicare eligibility triggers very important changes to your coverage from the University of Idaho Retiree Medical Plan. Once you are eligible for Medicare Parts A and B, claims payments will be delayed until Blue Cross of Idaho has received proof that you have enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. Proof of enrollment must be in the form of a photo copy of your Medicare ID card. Please present both your Medicare card and University of Idaho Retiree Medical Plan card when seeking medical care. Ask your providers to update their systems so that Medicare is the primary payer and the University retiree coverage is the secondary payer. After you are enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B, you will automatically be enrolled in SilverScript Employer PDP sponsored by the University of Idaho, a group Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (PDP) plus supplemental coverage from the University that provides more coverage than the standard Medicare Part D.

If you wish to continue coverage under the University of Idaho Plan, please be sure . to contact Medicare as soon as possible to elect Medicare Parts A and B. You can enroll in Medicare starting 3 months before the month you reach age 65. You MUST elect Medicare Parts A and B when you first become eligible to continue participation in the University of Idaho Retiree Health Plan. Unless you have a Medicare qualifying disability that qualifies you for Medicare coverage sooner, Medicare should be effective the first of the month in which you turn 65. DO NOT enroll in an individual Medicare Part D plan, or any other Medicare prescription drug coverage. The University of Idaho Retiree Health Plan will automatically enroll you in SilverScript Employer PDP as your Medicare prescription drug coverage. Even though you will automatically be enrolled in SilverScript Employer PDP sponsored by the University of Idaho, there are a couple steps you must take: You must'check the box on the enclosed Retiree Benefit Election Form, stating that you elect to be enrolled in the Retiree Health Plan. You must get enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B before the University can . enroll you in the prescription drug plan. Also, if you enroll in a different Medicare prescription drug plan or a Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage, your enrollment in SilverScript Employer PDP sponsored by the University of Idaho will be cancelled. If you jail to enroll in Medicare Parts A and 8 when you are first eligible, or you enroll in an individual Medicare prescription drug plan or Medicare Advantage plan with prescription drug coverage (other than SilverScript Employer PDP Birthday Letter 2016 2 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 130by the University of Idaho}, your participation in the University of Idaho Health 1an terminates and you forfeit all rights to rejoin the Plan at a later date. University of Idaho retirees have two separate medical plans. One plan is for retiree! and their covered dependent s when the retiree has not reached Medicare eligibiiJ1ty; the other plan activates for retirees and their covered dependents when the retiree has reached Medicare eligibility. Because you have now reached Med,are eligibility, your coverage will transition to the Retiree Medicare plan. A summary plan description, which describes the features of your new Plan, is encllosed. Please review the new summary. Most of the Plan benefits are similar; th .ir family members do not have a Preferred Provider Organization {PPO} network as a part of the Plan. Instead, you seek care from a provider who accepts Medicare assignment. if your spouse or other dependent(s) are not eligible for Medicare, they Jill continue to seek care from the Blue Cross Traditional Plan Providers. In addition, )our annual medical deductible is less and your prescription drug deductible is ~ligher in the Retiree Medicare Plan. I Amounts that have been counted or paid towards your annual deductibles, benefits or other plan maximums will be carried forward into the new plan for this contract year. This means that if you have already paid towards your deductible this plan year, you will be given credit. 2.)

Your Medicare eligibility triggers very important changes to your coverage under the University of Idaho Retiree Medical Plan. Once you are eligible for Medicare Parts A and B claims payments will be delayed until Blue Cross of Idaho has received proof that you have enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B. You must provide a photo copy of your Medicare card as proof of enrollment. Please present both your Medicare card and University of Idaho Retiree Medical Plan card when seeking medical care. Ask your providers to update their systems so that Medicare is the primary payer and the University retiree coverage is the secondary payer. 1.) Medicare becomes primary .. If you wish to centinue coverage under the University of Idaho Plan, please be sure to contact Medicare as soon as possible to elect Medicare Parts A and B. You can enroll in Medica~e \u00b7starting 3 months before the month you reach age 65. Coincident with enrolling in Medicare Parts A and B, you must enroll in one ofthe Medicare Part D prescription drug plans available in your area.

Unless you have a Medicare qualifying disability that qualifies you for Medicare coverage sooner, Medicare should be effective the first ofthe month in which you turn 65. The University plan drug benefit ceases upon Medicare eligibility, therefore you should enroll in Individual Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage. If you fail to enroll in Medicare Parts A and B when you are first eligible, your participation in the University of Idaho Health Plan will terminate and you will forfeit all rights to rejoin the Plan at a later date. University of Idaho retirees have two separate medical plans. One plan is for retirees and their covered dependents when the retiree has not reached Medicare eligibility; the other plan activates for retirees and their covered dependents when the retiree has reached Medicare eligibility. Because you have now reached Medicare eligibility, your medical coverage will transition to the Medicare Eligible Retiree Health Plan. A medical plan summary, which describes the features ofyour new Plan, is enclosed. Please review the new summary. Most of the Plan benefits are similar; however, there are some differences. For example, Medicare eligible retirees and their family members do not have a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) network as a part of the Plan. Instead, you seek care from a provider who accepts Medicare assignment. If your spouse or other dependent(s) are not eligible for Medicare, they will continue to seek care from the Blue Cross Traditional Plan Providers. In this scenario, the annual medical deductible is less. Amounts that have been counted or paid towards your annual deductibl es, benefits or other plan maximum s will be carried forward into the Medicare primary plan for this contract year. This means that if you have already paid towards your deductible this plan year, you will be given credit.

Medical management helps you better manage your health, your healthcare and your costs. There are many benefits of medical management, including less work or school missed due to illness, enjoying a better quality of life, staying healthy and living longer. Additionally, you may save money by paying less out of your pocket for healthcare expenses. The medical management program consists of a number of programs and provisions discussed in this section, including: Care management, Preauthorization (Medical only) Non-emergency preadmission notifications, Emergency notifications, Continued stay review, Discharge planning, Disease managem ent, and Bright Beginnings Early P\u00b7renatal Management Program. Care Management The care management program helps you coordinate care before, during and after treatment to ensure continuity of care for participants . It is a collaborative process among Blue Cross of Idaho, participants and providers. The program will help ensure you and your providers know what the plan will cover. Preauthorization The preauthorization program is designed to ensure you get the most appropriate, cost-effective care for your condition(s). Under the program, Blue Cross of Idaho determ.ines whether certain services and supplies are medically necessary or otherwise meet the requirements for plan coverage. Services that are authorized by Blue Cross of Idaho will be covered subject to all th? other terms and conditions of the plan. Services that are not authorized by Blue Cross of Idaho will not be covered, and you will be financially responsible if you choose to receive those services. Generally , the provider will obtain the preauthorization, particularly if you use an in-network provider. However, if you use an out-of-network provider, it is your responsibility to make sure that the preauthorization is obtained. If your in-network provider fails to obtain the appropriate preauthorization, you will not be held responsib le for the charges if the services are not authorized . In-network providers should work with Blue Cross of Idaho to complete any preauthorization requirements. However, it is always a good idea to check and ensure preauthorization has been completed.

Medicare Eligible Retiree Benefits-2016 15 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 153When You Have Other Coverage (Maintenance of Benefits) If you or your eligible dependents are covered by more than one medical plan, reimbursement s are coordinated between plans so benefits are not duplicated. How the Plans Coordinate Coverage Your medical benefits plan has maintenance of benefits (MOB) provision. This provision coordinates benefit payments from all medical plans that cover you and your eligible dependents, so that plan benefits are maintained at the level set by this plan after payments from all sources of coverage have been considered . When you have a claim for expenses covered by two or more plans, one plan pays benefits first. This is known as the primary plan. The other plan(s), called the secondary plan(s), then determines how much of the covered services, if any, are to be paid from the secondary plan(s). The Order of Benefit Determination rules in the SPD govern which plan will be considered primary and pay first, and which plan(s) will be considered secondary . A \"plan\" is any of the following that provides benefits or services for medical or dental care or treatment: Group and non-group insurance contracts, Health maintena nce organization (HMO) contracts, Closed panel or other forms of group or group-type coverage (either insured or uninsured), Medical care compone nts of long-term care contracts, such as skilled nursing care, Medical benefits under group or individual automobi le contracts, and Medicare or any other federal governmental plan, as permitted by law. If separate plans are used to provide coordinated coverage for a group member, the separate plans are considered parts of the same plan, and there is no MOB among those separate plans. A plan does not include: Hospital indemnity coverage or other fixed indemnity coverage , Accident-only coverage, Specified disease or specified accident coverage, Limited benefit health coverage, as defined by state law, School accident-type coverage, Benefits for non-medical components of long-term care policies, Medicare suppleme nt policies, or Medicare or any other federal governmental plan, unless permitted by law. Wl1en t11is medical benefits plan is primary, it pays or provides its benefits according t o this plan's terms of coverage and without regard to the benefits of any other plan. When tl1is medical benefits plan is secondary, it pays the amount necessary to ensure that the total combined amount you receive from this medical benefits plan and the primary plan is no greater than the amount you would have received under this medical benefits plan alone. Every effort has been made to make cerlain that the Information in this communication is accurate. However. /his communication Is only intended to give you an oveNiew of your benefit plans and does not contain all the details about file benefits provided, exclusions and other terms and conditions of the plans. Your benefits are determined according to the official SPD. If the information in/his communication differs from the SPD, the SPD will govern in all cases. The University may amend or terminate these plans or any benefits provided by these plans at any lime. Medicare Eligible Retiree Benefits- 2016 16 CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 CONSENT - BAHR - SECTION II TAB 3 Page 154Example of Secondary Plan Payment Under the Order of Benefit Determination Rules, if your enrolled spouse also has medical coverage through his or her employer, your spouse's employer's plan will be the primary payer. The University's benefit plan will be the secondary payer. This means the University 's benefit plan will pay up to the amount allowed under this plan's coverage less the amount the primary plan already has paid. For example, let's say that the University's benefit plan provides 80 percent coverage, your spouse's plan covers 50 percent, and your spouse has a covered, payable expense of $100. Your spouse's primary plan will pay 50 percent of the charge ($50), and the University 's benefit plan will then pay 80 percent of the charge less $50 (in this case, $30) toward the remaining eligible expense. But if your spouse's plan pays 80 percent and the University's benefit plan also allows 80 percent, no payment will be made by the'University 's benefit plan; this is because the maximum benefit of 80 percent has already been paid for the service. Coordination of Benefits with Medicare When you or your dependent reaches age 65 or becomes disabled, you or your dependent (as applicable) may be eligible for Medicare benefits. Medicare generally provides coverage for people age 65 or older, as well as for people entitled to Social Security disability benefits and those with end-stage renal disease. Once you become eligible for Medicare, Medicare will become your primary medical coverage and your University retiree medical coverage will become your secondary coverage (note that there is a limited exception in the case of end\u00ad stage renal disease). Once you become eligible for Medicare, you should enroll in Medicare Parts A and B to remain eligible for the University of Idaho Retiree Health Plan. That is because the Retiree Medical Plan integrates with Medicare on a maintenance of benefits basis as if you were enrolled in both Parts-even if you are not. If you do not enroll in Medicare Parts A and B, you may not receive the benefits you are entitled to and, therefore, may end up paying more for your medical care. In addition, you may be subject to late enrollment penalties if you don't enroll in Medicare when first eligible. You should apply for Medicare two to three months before reaching age 65. Contact your local Social Security office before you reach age 65 for more information about Medicare and your eligibility.

You may continue dental coverage for yourself and your eligible dependents. What you pay for dental coverage depends on the coverage Tier for which you are eligible. Please see the Eligibility section in the Retiree Health and Welfare Summary Plan Description (SPD) for more information . Please note: Dental coverage for dependents must mirror the retiree's coverage, regardless of Medicare eligibility or tier. Delta Dental of Idaho administers all dental plan options and provides access to its Premier and PPO networks of dental providers . (The PPO network provides the best discount.) How the Plan Works The plan pays a percentage of eligible dental charges. As a plan participant, you may visit any dentist you choose-a Delta Dental network provider, or a non-network dentist. Delta Dental has two participating provider networks: Delta Dental Premier and Delta Dental PPO. Some dentists participate in both networks. However, when you use a Delta Dental participating provider: You don't have to file claim forms; You typically pay less for services because the provider charges a negotiated rate; and You cannot be billed for any charges above the negotiated fee the provider has agreed to charge. If you use a non-participating dentist, you may need to pay additional out-of-pocket expenses. If the dentist is a non-participating dentist, Delta Dental will base the benefit on the lesser of the submitted amount or Delta Dental's non-participating dentist fee. It is your responsibility to make full payment to the non-participating dentist for charges above Delta Dental's non-participating dentist fee. How to Locate Delta Dental Participating Dentists You can find names of Delta Dental participating providers by logging on to www.deltadentalid.com. Annual Deductible The dental plan has an annual deductible you must satisfy before the plan will pay benefits for certain services during that calendar year. There is no deductible for Class I services.

Drugs may be added or removed or restrictions may be added or changed. These resh\u00b7ictions include: Quantity Limits (QL) For cettain chugs, SilverScript limits the amount of the drug that it will cover. Prior Authorization (PA) SilverScript requires you or your physician to get prior authorization for cettain drugs. This means that you will need to get approval from us before we fill your prescription. If you don't get approval, SilverScript will not cover the drug. Step Therapy (ST) In some cases, SilverScript requires you to first try a cettain drug to treat yom medical condition before we will cover another drug for that condition. For example, if Drug A and Drug B both treat your medical condition, SilverScript will not cover Drug B unless y0u try Drug A first. If Drug A does not work for you, SilverScript will then cover Drug 13. How will I determine my drug costs? SilverScript groups each medication into one of three tiers: Generic di'Ugs (Tier 1)-most cost effective drugs to buy. The active ingredients in generic ch\u00b7ugs are exactly the same as the active ingredients in brand drugs whose patents have expired. They are required by the Food and Drug Adminish\u00b7ation (FDA) to be as safe and effective as the brand drug. Preferred Brand drugs (Tier 2)-brand ch\u00b7ugs that do not have a generic equivalent and are included on a preferred drug list.

Course Description and Objectives Goal: Nutrition is a subject that most of us have a personal interest in, whether you are concerned about your own nutr itional health, a parent with diabetes or cancer, or a friend who has been struggling with an eating disorder. You may have enrolled in this course expecting to learn what to eat and how to choose healthy foods, but then be surprised when we launch into a lecture on fat metabolism, protein synthesis and fuel utilization during starvation. In this respect, this course is not a personal nutrition course, but one designed to build a foundation of knowledge that you can use professionally and personally. My hope is that you will be inspired to connect the details of a nutrient's chemistry and the body's metabolism to the relevant aspects of how daily food cho ice can promote health, prevent disease and increase overall wellness. This course provides a comprehensive tour of nutrition by exploring diet planning principles and examining the role of macro and micronutrients in promoting optimal health and prevention of chronic disease. Students will build a base of credible nutrition information that is applicable both personally and professionally. Students will apply this knowledge to their own personal nutrition life and test their comprehension through a variety of approaches. My goal as an instructor is to provide the student with opportunities to learn sound science-based nutrition information and inspire a lifelong interest in nutrition. By the time you finish this course, you should be able to: Identify the psychobiosocial influences (behavior, values, culture, and availability) that direct food choice and recognize how these impact eating behavior and food attitudes. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 26 Boise State University - Spring 2016 - HLTHST 207 - Dunnagan Page 1 of 9 Describe diet planning guidelines and be able to apply these principles to name foods that provide rich sources of essential nutrients that protect health. Develop and apply the skills of translating sound nutrition research into useable information for yourself, your family and others you may come into contact through your professional life. Explain the role of macro and micronutrients in promoting optimal health and prevention of chronic disease. Articulate a basic understanding of how physical activity and nutrition contribute to a healthy lifestyle emphasizing the role of f uel and fluids. Evaluate your personal nutrition profile by utilizing computer dietary analysis, reflection and writing. Demonstrate communication skills, critical thinking and appropriate use of resources by participating in group projects and discussions on contemporary nutrition topics.

I expect you to log on to the class site a minimum of five times a week. When you log on to the site, check the Home Page for any announcements, updates or notifications of any course changes. You are responsible fo r the material contained in both these sections. 2. Check email daily for any correspondence from t he instructor or your classmates regarding class changes and/or group projects. 3. It is also your responsibility to make adequate time for this course. Online courses require more time spent on the course material and good time management skills. The University standard is a minimum of 3-4 hours of internet class study time per credit per week. This equates to 9-12 hours of class work per week. No Joke! 4. Importantly, it is your responsibility to communicate with me. If you are having trouble with an assignment or a personal issue that is impeding your learning and progress please let me know. In addition, if I don't hear from you or see that you haven't logged on to the site or submitted work, I will assume that you are planning on dropping the course and taking that action. Do not wait until you are too far behind to contact me with a list of reasons that you were unable to complete the tasks CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 28 Boise State University - Spring 2016 - HLTHST 207 - Dunnagan Page 1 of 9 required. This behavior, unfortunately, is rampant and I do not make allowances, nor do I negotiate here. Not knowing if your work was submitted successfully is also not an allowable reason to have late work. Be proactive and learn how to submit and confirm the submission of assignments on Bb. 5. No allowances for missing assignments are allowed except for a medical emergency or family bereavement with documentation. I want all of you to succeed in this course, but it moves quickly and we cover a lot of material wh ich can be challenging! It will be well worth it and valuable to you for a lifetime of good health! Methods of Instruction This course is conducted entirely online. You will read selections from the textbook and material available online, complete critical thinking questions and/or case stud ies about the material you've read, participate in group discussions and projects and analyze your food intake using the DW+ software, located inside Mindtap. You may complete the online activities from wherever you choose -- from home, from wor k, or from a campus computer lab. However, this course will be conducted on a fixed schedule, meaning that you will be unable to work ahead and complete the course before the semester ends. Instead, I will make available portions of the course on a modular basis, right up to the end of the semester. Each of the four modules is 4 weeks long, and I will make avai lable portions of each as you progress along. In most instances, the module's reading assignment will be the focus of our discussions and other activities. If you have questions about what you've read, please ask them; chances are, other students will have the same questions and then I can send out an announcement to help others. Finally, please note that the course site contains quite a bit of material that complements and supplements your text, including tutorial videos and interactive documents. Please use these materials to enhance your understand ing of the text and to verify that you have understood what you should understand after completing each reading. Diet ary Analysis Project Each week and throughout the semester you will be working on a personal nutrition analysis of your daily inta ke, followed by questions pertaining to your food intake. The main objective of this assignment is to apply the principles of nutrition you have learned to your own diet. The DW+ nutrition tasks are presented each week throughout the semester. A short essay synthesizing the material from your nutrition tasks will be your final exam fulfillment. Discussions **Read carefully if you would like to earn an A in this course** CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 29 Boise State University - Spring 2016 - HLTHST 207 - Dunnagan Page 1 of 9 For the Group Discussions, these require that both an original post and a response to one other student is completed over a 7 day period, so these have hard and fast deadlines and there are no makeups allowed. I require that you post your initial discussion posting the first 4 days of the discussion and post your r eply to one other classmate the following 3 days of the 7- day discussion period. This is important because your timely posting allows your classmates to read and respond to your posting and enables you to receive full credit for your discussion. Please refer to the discussion grading rubric under the discussion tabs. Please follow the course calendar carefully to help kee p you on track, AS DISCUSSIONS HAVE A HARD AND FAST DEADLINE AND CANNOT BE MADE UP. Assignments Policy In terms of quality, my expectations are simple, yet high. Assignments should be well written (please use spell check), using correct grammar and clearly address the issues being asked. Late assignments are marked down at a rate of 5% per day (starting from due date). Assignments are due by 11:59 p m Mountain Standard Time. Email me when you need to have an extension, and I will extend this up to 5 days after the due date listed. I will not accept assignments more than five days late . An emailed assignment sent without an attachment or with the wrong attachment is still considered late. However, I know life happens so each student gets one 'free late assignment'. This means you can turn in one assignment, five days after the due date with no consequence (i.e. no late points deducted). *Email me to let me know which assignment you would like to use your free pass for so I can extend this for you in Mindtap. You may put a comment in the comment box associated with the assignment or type it directly into the assignment. *If you have documentation of a family bereavement absence and/or a medical emergency, I will make an allowance for makeup work on a case by case basis. IMPORTANT REMINDER: **DISCUSSIONS AND GROUP WORK HAVE HARD AND FAST DEADLINES SO THE FREE PASS CANNOT BE USED HERE- THE 7-DAY FREE LATE PASS IS VALID ONLY ON INDIVIDUAL ASSIGNMENTS. ** Blackboard Assignment Submission Information When submitting assignments with attached files, please note the following : File Naming Convention: your last name, first initial and assignment name. For example, my file name for Highlight #1 writ ing assignment would be DunnaganS_H1.doc. I appreciate you doing this as it leads to less confusion, fewer communication problems and easier retrieval of documents. You can also confirm that you have successfully submitted your assignment in 2 ways: 1) Hitting the Submit button at the bottom of the Submission page and then seeing a green success message at the top of the page. 2) You can also go to the \"My Grades\" area and look under the submission area to check for the green exclamation mark, that indicates that your assignment is available for me to grade.

This project is to be a behavior you have tried to change in the past but have been unsuccessful. Past students recommend something you are interested in because you spend a significant time tracking and writing about this behavior change. This can be in the realm of physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, or social health. Each week you find a course link to Behavior Change Journal entry for the week. You will complete the behavior change contract and journal your progress on the Journal CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 39throughout the semester as you work toward your health goal. You are to update your behavior change project each week. (a) weekly journals with 5 days per week of data tracking your behavior change (b) answers to the 3-5 questions and (b) a properly labeled line graph depicting the progress of your behavior change over time. 6. Adhere to Assignment Guidelines . Type all assignments that are turned in, except where otherwise noted. All of your assignments are to be your own work, not cut and paste and not quoted from other sources. Use your own words to answer all questions. All assignments are to be individually done by you unless I specifically tell you otherwise. Be sure your name is on all your work, the files names (yourname assignmentname and if you are turning in an assessment or attached a typed document be sure to put your name on the actual paper. All assignments are due by 11:59 pm on the date listed on the syllabus unless otherwise directed by Dr. Spear. Any assignment turned in after class is considered late. All late work grades will drop by 10% within the first 24 hours, 30% within 24- 48 hours, and after 48 hours past the due date no credit will be given. No work will be accepted after Sunday, June 28th, 2015. All assignments are to be typed, using a 12-point font with standard 1-inch margins unless otherwise instructed. a. To receive the most points possible include both the question and your answer. b. Your response should include an example to support your answer/conclusion. Back up your answers with examples from the text or other valid materials. Brief answers receive few points so be thorough. Employers want people with excellent written and oral communication skills. The Boise State Writing Center, 426-1298, is available to help you refine your writing skills. 7. Your responsibility . A successful student is prepared to learn, asks questions, goes beyond the minimum assignment and has good self-discipline. I expect you to be a successful student as I hope you expect me to be a successful teacher. If you have questions, someone else does too so be sure to ask. 8. Protocol for emailing Dr. Spear or Kennedy : When sending an email, please put the class name, class section or color (Blue) and a brief description about the subject of the email in the subject line. Example: KINES 140 BLUE -Question re Assignment How Healthy Are You. Start your e-mail with a greeting and end your e-mail with your name, Student ID and phone number. You must use your Bronco Email so I know the message is from a student and not spam. I receive lots of email and don't want to overlook your messages. 9. Demonstrate professional conduct . Participate fully and ask questions. A successful student is prepared to learn, asks questions, goes beyond the minimum CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 40assignment and has good self-discipline. I expect you to be a successful student as I hope you expect me to be a successful teacher. 10. Semester Extra Credit One semester extra credit opportunity per student, worth a maximum 15 points and is due Sunday, June 28th, 2015 . No late extra credit will be accepted. Participate in a health-related activity presented on campus or in the community, i.e. political action around a health issue, blood drive, HIV testing, fitness testing, participation in a health related workshop etc. You may also follow your Stress Plan, Exercise Plan or Nutrition Plan for two weeks. Submit a t yped two page, double space, reaction paper of your experience, must include the following paragraph headings: (1) description of the experience, (2) what did you learn, (3) what dimension of your health did this experience impact and (4) how you can use the information in your life. 11.Check your grades - I strive to have all work graded within 72 hours. If you don't see your grade then feel free to email me and give me a friendly nudge. Like many faculty, grading is not my #1 favorite activity and sometimes I procrastinate, unlike all of you who are so prompt in your postings ;). It is up to you to check on your grades. You will have one extra credit assignme nt and that is due Sunday, June 28th, 2015 by 11:59. All work is to be turned in by then and no late work will be accepted. Contacting me after final grades at the end of the summer term are posted and asking to complete extra credit or redo an assignment will prompt me to direct you to the Course Information section of the class and say NO. You have plenty of opportunities to be successful. You can see the grading rubrics for each of the assignments so look at those for guidance, post your questions on the Class Question & Answers Discussion Board for us to answer and keep asking questions so you are clear about what is expected. Your employers expect clear, open and honest communication and so do I.

Seibert Department of Psychology, E617 pennieseibert@boisestate.edu Office Hours: Tuesday 11-1:15 PM (modified on exam and writing days) and varied weekly in person and online times by appointment REQUIRED TEXT : Exploring Psychology in Modules by David G. Myers SUPPLEMENTAL (NOT REQUIRED) MATERIALS: Dr. Seibert's Notes for Psyc101 COURSE DESCRIPTION General Psychology 101 is an introduction to the subjects of Psychological Science. These topics include: History and Methods of Psychological Science; Neuroscience; Consciousness; Developing through the Life Span; Memory; Thinking, Psychology); Personality; Psychological Disorders; Therapy; and Social Psychology. Moreover, this course is designed to meet the University Disciplinary Lens in Social Sciences (DLS) Requirement, s pecifically, University Learning Objective (ULO) 11 : Apply knowledge and the methods of inquiry characteristic of the social sciences to explain and evaluate human behavior and institutions will be addressed throughout the course. The objectives of this course are to: Provide the framework for a basic understanding of psychological science Serve as a foundation for subsequent studies in psychological science and its applications Learn to evaluate material using scientific methodology Enhance knowledge and awareness of the unique contributions of diverse groups and their beliefs, values, knowledge, and experiences to the field of psychological science Encourage self-awareness of and insight into how culture affects behavior choices Reflect on your cultural background and its implications Develop the ability to work with diverse individuals and groups These objectives will be addressed through lectures, videos, readings, discussion, exams, in-class projects, and writing assignments. CLASS TIME Will be spent covering selected material from the text, but will primarily serve to supplement the text. Students need to read the text outside of class . Class time will include lectures, discussions, videos, experiential learning in CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 48 2 the form of in-class projects, and exams. Students are responsible for all of the material in the text regardless of whether the topics are addressed during formal class meetings. Students who read the appropriate materials prior to the time scheduled for classroom discussion of the topic will find the class lectures, videos , and projects more meaningful as well as easier to understand and remember. It is important to understand that the text will serve as only one source of information for this course. Additional material that is not addressed in the text will be presented in class. Thus, class attendance is essential for successful course completion. Given the size of introductory classes, you will need to be particularly aware of several considerations. Attendance is not taken. If you wish to talk, read, or whatever...do it some place other than the classroom. Only attend class if you want to listen quietly. Even a little noise disrupts the class experience for others. Be considerate of fellow classmates who attend class to learn and value the process. It is your responsibility to help control the class --after all it is your class, and your experience . You have the ability to make it a good one. In the interest of safety and providing the best classroom experience for all students, Dr. Seibert does not allow students to arrive late or leave early. It is important to understand that this is not a \"drop by\" course experience. You are expected to arrive on time and remain for the entire class session. Laptops are allowed in the upper stage right five rows ONLY. VIDEOS Videos will be displayed in class to expand and enrich information. . Questions regarding information in the videos will appear on exams. These videos are only available when shown in class. If you do not attend class on days videos are being displayed, there is no way to watch it outside of class. TEACHING ASSISTANTS (TAs) TAs are available most days (see schedule) for tutoring individuals and groups, exam study sessions, grade checks, and other special student needs. Grades may be checked only during office hours as we do not give grades over the telephone or by e-mail. You do not need an appointment to meet with TAs, simply visit during their regularly scheduled office hours. TAs cannot be reached by telephone nor are they available outside of their regularly scheduled office hours. Additionally, TAs cannot change grades or points earned without direct permission from Dr. Seibert. Any such requests or concerns must be addressed with Dr. Seibert. You are strongly encouraged to meet with the TAs regularly. TAs do not hold office hours during finals week. COORDINATORS Coordinators manage TA activities. They do not attend class, but they are CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 49 3 very familiar with course material and requirements. Coordinators also hold office hours (see TA schedule) for questions, grade checks, and other needs. Unlike TAs, coordinators are available by email (see TA schedule) for questions about the course, assignment requirements, or any other concerns. CONTACTING DR. SEIBERT Email is the fastest and preferred way to reach Dr. Seibert. If you email, be sure to write P syc 101 on the subject line so your message won't end up in Dr. Seibert's ju nk mail. If you have sent an email to Dr. Seibert and she has not responded within two days, please resend the message. EVALUATION TASK POINTS Four exams 115 Video -article project 6 DL Assessment 5 8 Journal Entries 16 Outside Class Activity 10 Four Reading/Writing Summary Papers 8 Three In -Class Projects 9 Course Overview 1 Total 170 FINAL GRADES: (A153 and above; B 152-136; C135-119; D118-102 F101 and below).

These excuses need to be approved by Dr. Seibert. THESE MAKE UP EXAMS MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE ORIGINAL EXAM DATE OR YOU WILL RECEIVE A ZERO. Approved make-up exams may be taken in the TA office during scheduled office hours (see TA Schedule). The final exam must be ta ken on the date listed by the University for a ll classes scheduled at this time.

Discuss nature vs. nurture: what trends are we seeing in violent outburst behaviors? Do you think one has a stronger impact on outcomes? Why or why not? 2. What are some of the environmental factors that have been related to changes in brain activity/chemistry? Discuss how these changes occur at different stages of one 's lifespan (e.g. childhood, adolescence). 3. What are some potential ideas for combating this problem? Discuss the role parents and schools must play for screening adolescents for depression/violent acts. How can violent acts in schools be best prevented? 4. Greg Van Rybroek, the psychologist at Mendota Juvenile Treatment Center, stated that rather than being \"soft on crime, \" they are being \"smart on people \". What is your opinion on the efficacy of the correctional/mental health facility that was explored in the video? 5. The video discusses the need for power in many violent individuals. Do you believe the media plays an influential role on this need, and the actions that follow? Why or why not? 6. Discuss the relevant parts of the brain that affect violent behavior. Which do believe is the most influential, and how would you suggest to best nurture it? 7. Choose and research a recent violent act that has occurred. How do the concepts discussed in the video possibly explain the individual' s actions? CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 55 9 8. Do you believe science will soon have the ability to predict mass murderers? How would these predictions influence the power of free will, and the belief of \"innocent until proven guilty \"? 9. Paul Frick stated in the video that there are no \"lost causes. \" After an individual commits a violent act, can the individual be rehabilitated? Do you believe there is a line drawn between murder and other less severe violent acts? Option 2: Participate In Experiments Conducted By The Department Of Psychology. If you choose to participate in experiments , refer to http://bsuresearch.sona-systems.com/ . You will need to follow these instructions precisely as indicated. If you choose to participate in experiments, it is best to sign up early in the semester, as there may not be enough opportunities later in the semester. To fulfill this requirement you m ust successfully participate in 5 credits. The number of credits per experiment is listed with the experiment sign up. If you sign up for an experiment, you must realize this is a very serious appointment. If you wish to cancel your appointment you must do so as indicated in the instructions. Do not call Dr. Seibert to cancel. She does not manage the experimental sign ups. It is your responsibility to keep track of your participation. Once you have completed this assignment and have earned the necessary credits, print a hard copy to ve rify your experiment participation. Give this hard copy to Dr. Seibert or one of the TA's and keep a copy for your records . ACADEMIC DISHONESTY : If you are caught engaging in academic dishonesty you will receive a zero for the work, a report will be filed with the Office of the Dean of Students , and any other measures deemed appropriate. Refer to http://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu/ regarding the range of activities that constitute dishonesty. DISABILITY STATEMENT: Students with disabilities needing accommodations to fully participate in this class should contact the Disability Resource Center (DRC). All accommodations must be approved through the DRC prior to being implemented. To learn more about the accommodation process, visit the DRC's website at http://drc.boisestate.edu/new-drc-students/ . If you have accommodations approved by the Disability Resource Center, meet with Dr. Seibert during her office hours to discuss necessary accommodations.

Read the syllabus! This syllabus is vital to success in the course. It contains information detailing each assignment, instructions and contact information for your TAs/coordinators/instructor, a schedule for the entirety of the semester, corresponding due dates, and much more. Any questions regarding what is expected of students and how class is ran/organized can be found in the syllabus. 2. Read the textbook! Dr. Seibert carefully chooses the textbook to supplement her lectures. There is material in the textbook that Dr. Seibert cannot fit into her lecture for time, or material she believes is covered sufficiently in the textbook. You may get tested on this material! Furthermore, reading the textbook gives you another way to learn the material, and reinforces what is taught in lecture. We would recommend reading the assigned modules before each lecture, so you have familiarity with the material before Dr. Seibert lectures. 3. Attend class! Not only is this a very effective way for you to absorb the material, and learn what Dr. Seibert finds most important, it also ensures that you are in attendance for any potential pop quizzes and class projects. Furthermore, any videos that are shown inside of class cannot be viewed outside of the scheduled viewing, so attending class is your only chance to see any of the videos Dr. Seibert selects to reinforce textbook/lecture information. 4. Pay attention! While it is beneficial to attend class, you must also actively listen during lecture in order for you to learn the material. 5. Study! This is the best way to be prepared for exams. There is a multitude of ways to study the material, from study groups to flashcards to teaching the material to a friend or family member. We strongly encourage you to study throughout the semester, and to not wait until the night before an exam. It is well-known that \"cramming\" is not an effective way to study. 6. Visit the TAs! They can assist you in many ways; they can help with assignment requirements, review any completed assignments and give suggestions for improvement, tutor you on any concepts you find confusing from lecture or the textbook, and can give you additional ideas to study the material for exams.

Email Policy When emailing a TA, please contact the TA who is assigned to your last name. You should email a TA if you have questions a bout the syllabus, content discussed in class, or assignments. You should email me if you have an y personal questions or questions that extend beyond what was discussed in class. If you have a question about your grade on an assignment, please contact your TA first. If the issue is still not resolved, you are welcome to contact me. If you have an issue with your exam, please contact me. Please be courteous and respectful when emailing myself or the TAs. We will do the same. Course Roles I view my responsibilities as your instructor to be to: *Clearly articulate accurate and appropriate information about the psychology of interpersonal relationships. *Teach how to interpret and apply research in real life. *Help you succeed in mastering the material in this class. *Give you adequate and timely feedback about your progress in this course. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 63 Your role as a student is to: *Arrange your schedule so you can come to class regularly and to take your exams in the testing center *Keep up with assignments, online lessons, and readings. *Learn from your fell ow classmates as well as from lecture and the text. *Be engaged when you come to class. *Ask for help when you need it. Course Resources Required Text: Miller, R. S. (2012). Intimate Relationships (6th edition) . New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. You will also need a clicker for this course. Course Reading I expect that you will have read the assigned readings and viewed the assigned PowerPoints prior to the day they will be co vered in lecture. Lectures will be tailored assuming that you have read the material and viewed the PPTs and will include material not covered in the text. Exam questions will come from the text, PPTs, and lecture. Anything discussed in the classroom may appear on the exam. Course Description In this course, you will learn about the dynamics of close relationships from a variety of psychological perspectives. Topics covered include sexuality development, sexual behavior, initial attraction, dating patterns, long-term relationships, familial relationships, intimacy and communication, domestic violence, relationship development, and relationship dissolution. It is your job to be familiar with content covered in PSYC 101. If you need a refresher, please refer to your general psychology textbook or you may discuss content during office hours. Neither myself nor the TAs will answer PSYC 101 questions via email. Additionally, this course has an optional service-learning component that is designed to help students learn about how experience s with relationships in the real world compare to what we learn in class. This experience will also foste r a sense of empathy for people who deal with negative relationship ex periences as well as reduce stereotypes about people who have experienced or have the potential to ex perience abusive relationships. There are two lab sections for this option, each worth one cre dit. One section will be offered over the course of the regular semester (PSYC 271SL-001) and one will be offered during the 8-week session (PSYC 271SL- 002). Both labs will cover the same materials and will have the same course requirements; the only difference is how much time you will have to complete your service learning requirements. Although you are not required to participate in either lab section, I strongly encourage you to do so as it will help you apply the course material to the real world. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 64 \"Service-Learning is a teaching strategy that integrates course content with relevant community service. Through assignments and class discussions, students critically reflect on the service in order to increase their understanding of course content, gain a broader appreciation of the discipline, and enhance their sense of civic responsibility.\" - Adapted from the National and Community Service Trust Act Course Goals *To teach you about the different theories of interpersonal relationships, including relationship formation, maintenance, and dissolution. *To foster an interest in the psychology of interpersonal relationships. *To reduce misconceptions about people who have experienced abusive relationships. *Foster a sense of empathy for individuals with varying relationship experiences. *To learn about the current state of relationship research. Long-Term Course Objectives: What I hope you take away from the class after the course is over *Apply content from this course to help navigate real life interactions with others. *Utilize knowledge from this course to develop and maintain healthy relationships in the future. *Recognize if you are in a relationship that is not healthy and use the tools learned in class to either help improve the relationship or to help you successful ly dissolve the relationship. How to Succeed Every one of you has the ability to get an A in this class. Here is how I recommend you prepare: *Read the assignments before class - this will help you gain basic knowledge before class and you will be better prepared to ask questions in class if something is unclear. *Don't cram at the last minute. Try to spend some time each day reviewing. * Keep up with assignments. *Ask questions! I would love to answer any questions you have, either in class or during office hours. There is no such thing as a stupid question, and chances are that someone else has the same question, so be brave and ask. Grading Scale A+ = 98% and above B- = 80.00% to 81.9999 % D+ 68.00% to A- = 90.00% to 91.9999 % C 72.00% 77.9999% 60.00% to 61.9999% B+ to 89.9999% C - = 70.00% to 71.9999% F = Below 60.00% B = 82.00% to 87.9999% Please note that I will not \"round-up\" if you are between grades. I offer extra credit in this course, so if you are worried about barely missing a grade, make sure to do the extra credit assignments. If you do all of the extra credit and are just short of a grade, my justification is that you would not have been so close to the next grade without the extra credit. If you did not do the extra credit and are betw een grades, you should have taken advantage of this opportunity.

The quest will be open note and open book, but you will NOT be able to use each other as resources. The purpose of the quest is to help you get used to my testing style as well as help you digest some of the more complicated topics related to dyadic data research methods. Exams There will be 3 exams for this class. The exams are NOT cumulative and are each worth 100 points. The exams will include dif ferent types of questions which will include multiple choice and short answer questions. Exam ma terial will include definitions and concepts taken from both in-class material, online lecture, and from the text book. All videos and activities in class could potentially be on the e xam, so it is to your benefit to attend class. Testing Center All unit exams will be taken in the testing center. You must schedule an exam on the Information Technology Website at https://atapps.boisestate.edu/elearning/testinglab/student/scheduler/default.asp . You will have several days to take the exam. To succeed on the exam, read all materials before lecture, actively take notes during lecture, and en gage in the classroom activities in addition to studying for the exam. Because you have several days to take the exam I have a NO MAKE-UP POLICY. Althoug h students may finish the exam earlier, you will be allowed 2 hours for the exam in the CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 66testing center. It is your responsibility to make sure you schedule enough time to take the exam in the testing center Participation Clickers are required for this class. You will be responsible for using your clickers to answer questions during the class period. A response to each \"opinion question\" is worth 2 participation points. In order to receive 2 points for a \"test your knowledge\" question, you must answer the question corr ectly. In order to receive the maximum number of participation points, you must answer at least 100 questions (think of it more along the lines of needing to acquire 100 points). If you answer more questions than that, you can receive a half point of extra credit for each additional response, up to a maximum of 5 points. Additi onally, I have the right to double the amount of class participation on any given day if class attendance is low. Participation will be calculated at the end of the semester. If you are curious about your participation score, keep a personal tally every time you answer a clicker question correctly or answer an opinion question. If you do not bring your clicker to class, you will not be able to receive participation points for the clicker questions. The ONLY exception is for the first day of class. If your clicker doe s not register or you do not buzz in on time, you will not receive a participation point for that question. I will not calculate your participation grade prior to the end of the semester, so do not even ask. Asking me to calculate your participation will result in a zero for the Syllabus Knowledge Extra Credit (see below). If you miss class due to absence, you will not be able to make up participation points. If you miss class due to an excused absence, I require documentation for the absence before I will take it into account. In terms of calculating participation points for people who provide evidence for an excused absence , I take the total number of points possible for the class, and subtract the amount of points missed that were excused. If the value is less than 100, their participation score is a percentage out of this new number. So for examp le, if you missed 20 points for an excused absence, but there are 180 possible 180 -20=160, which is still well over 100 needed for a perfect score. However, if you were gone for a longer period of time and missed 90 points , I would subtract 180-90 = 90, and then calculate the percentage . For example, if you earned 80/90 points possible, you participation would be 88.89/100 instead of 80/100. Also note that if you are on the original class roster and do not attend the first week of classes, you will be dropped from the course. If you are not present for the first day, I will assume this is not a high priority course for you. If you have an emergency where this is not feasible, please talk to me as soon as possible. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 67Perceptions of Relationships Reflections This semester, you will write two short reflections on your perceptions of romantic relationships. You will write a short 1-2 page paper on h ow you perceive romantic relationships prior to learning a majority of the content in this course. Toward the end of the semester, you will reflect on your initial perceptions and discuss whether or not they changed and why. Please note that if you do not turn in the initial assignment, it will be very difficult for you to do well on the second part, so it is to your advantage to turn in the first assignment. Also, you have the option of turning in the first part of this assignment by 4:30pm on Friday, October 2nd for the opportunity to receive feedback and for a chance to revise and resubmit your work by the regular due date. Relationship Psychology in the Media Papers Over the course of the semester, you will need to write two short papers on how you observe at least one concept from class on relationship psychology in the media. You may choose a character/couple from a TV show or movie, a news story, a depiction in a fiction or non-fiction novel, etc. More details will be available on the rubric. There will be three opportunities for you to turn in this assignment (1 paper per unit), but you only need to turn in 2 papers. If you turn in all three assignments, only y our top 2 papers will count toward your grade. Learning from Service Learners Reflection Some students in PSYC 271 will elect to participate in an optional service learning lab. Students who opt into this lab will be required to put together a presentation, which will be made available to the entire class on Blackboard. Students who do not participate in the SL lab will answer reflection questions on what they learned about relationship psychology through their classmates' presentations. Additionally, stud ents who are enrolled in an SL lab option will need to complete a reflection on what they gained by developing a presentation for their classmates as well as on viewing their classmates' presentations. Group Case Studies This semester, you will be divided into groups of 4-5 students. Over the course of the semester, you will need to work with your group to the material in class using characters that you create. There will be three parts to this assignment. First, you will develop a character that you will use throughout the course to answer questi ons related to material discussed in class. You will want to create a detailed character so that you will be able to use it to address multiple topics. Each person in class will create his or her own character before being assigned to groups. You are welcome to turn in this assignment by 4:30pm on Friday, October 2nd if you would like the opportunity to receive feedback and have a chance to revise and resubmit your character creation by the regular due date. Next, you will need to use these characters in your group to reflect on the topics covered each week in class by fitting them into a different scenario. You will have the last 20-30 minutes of CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 68class on most days (see schedule) to work on this assignment with your group, and the assignment will be due on Blackboard b y the start of the next class at 4:30pm. You only need to turn in one assignment per group. You are welcome to use your book and notes for these assignments. Only your top 10 Case Study assignments (outside of the character creation) will count toward your grade. I f you do 11, the next highest score will count as extra credit. Finally, at the end of the semester, you will need to evaluate your group members on their contribution to the group. You will receive a grade both for completing this assignment as well as on your ability to be a team player based on your group members' ratings of you. Extra Credit Several opportunities for extra credit will be presented throughout the semester. Revise and Resubmit Policy Although the class does not officially start until October 20th, you may benefit from turning in the Initial Relationship Reflection and the Career Creation assignments early. If you turn in your assignments to Blackboard by 4:30pm on Friday, October 2nd, you will receive a tentative grade with feedback from your teaching assistants by the time the class officially starts. If you are not happy with your grade, you can turn in a revised version of the assignment by the official due date of the assignment, which will replace your original score. Please note you have one attempt to resubmit and that grades will be returned to you by the date listed on the due date lists. Classroom Atmosphere Please be respectful of your fellow students and of me. Food and drinks are welcome in the classroom as long as they are quiet f oods (i.e. fruit snacks are okay, but an apple is not). Also, please try to remember to put your cell phone on silent at the beginning of the class period. Similarly, if you constantly use your phone or laptop in class, please sit in the back of the room or on the sides so as not to distract other students or myself. Also, please be considerate of the ideas of others; while it is okay to constructively critique an idea, try to refrain from criticizing the person. Finally, please do not bring children or pets to class. Late Work Late work will only be accepted up to 2 days late (including weekends). Each day the work is late, there will be a penalty. Work must be posted on Blackboard promptly by the time class starts or work will be considered late. Please note that papers turned in at 4:30:01pm are considered late. Also note that if you are submitting papers off campus, there may be a time lag of a few minutes between when you submit and when Blackboard accepts your paper. Note that the late policy also applies to group assignments!!! Time Late Total Possible Grade CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 69 1 second - 24 hours late 75% 1 - 2 days late (48 hrs.) 50% It is your responsibility to make sure that your paper uploaded to Blackboard and that the file opens . I will not accept any late papers after 48 hours, even if the file was created ahead of time. I also will not allow you to resubmit a corrupted file after 48 hours past the due date. If you are unsure of how to submit your files, please contact myself or a TA. You are welcome to turn in any work early. All assignments must be uploaded to Blackboard unless otherwise stated. Grading Policy Teaching assistants will be responsible for grading a majority of assignments. I will also double check 4 papers from each TA to determine interrater reliability. I will personally grade all of the exams. If you are unsati sfied with your grade on a written assignment, you are welcome to request a re -grade. You must request the re-grade within 72 hours of the \"grade-by\" date (se e the due date list on Blackboard). CAUTION: If you request this option, ther e is no guarantee your score will increase. I may grade more harshly than your TA, which would result in a lower score on the assignment. By requesting a re-grade, you are agreeing to the possibility of receiving a lower score than the original grade. Academic Dishonesty I will have absolutely NO tolerance for any form of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes behaviors such as cheating on a test, collaborating with other students when not given permission to do so, submitting an assignment that you had already submitted for another class, using a friend's clicker to fake their participation, and plagiarism. It also includes copying wording from the assignment or copying wording from the lecture slides in your paper. If you are caught being academically dishonest, you will receive a zero on the assignment. If you are caught twice, you will fail the class. Each offense will result in a report to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities and the second offense will also be reported to your academic advisor. If you are unclear about the definition of academic dishonesty, either talk to me during office hours or refer to the Student Code of Conduct on academic dishonesty (Article 6, Section 1). Special Arrangements If you feel that you many need accommodations based on the impact of a disability, please talk to me about this during the first week of class. To learn more about services BSU provides to students with disabilities, you can visit the Disability Resource Center website at http://drc.boisestate.edu .You will also need to contact the Disability Resource Center at 208- 426-1583 located in the Administration Building, room 114 to meet with a specialist and coordinate reasonable accommodations for any documented disability. I want everyone to be able to succeed, so do not hesitate if you need accommodations.

Course Requirements: Participation & Classroom Behavior: I'm excited about another engaging semester in PSYC 301! In order to fully participate in this course, we must agree to abide by certain guidelines of professional conduct and behavior. As the professor, I will come to classes prepared, engaged, and ready to establish a learning environment that is interesting, challenging, respectful, and hopefully enjoyable. I promise to treat you, both inside and outside of the classroom with respectfulness and professionalism. As a student, the following behavior is expected: 1. Supporting the learning of your classmates by refraining from talking when either the professor or another student is talking or when a video is displayed. 2. Use technology such as cell phones, laptops, and tablets in a respectful manner that does not distract your classmates. 3. Please arrive and leave class on time which minimizes disruption to others. If you must leave early or come late please do so as unobtrusively as possible. 4. Please do your best to understand and respect viewpoints that differ from your own. While you will never be expected to agree with everything your classmates and professor has to say, you will be expected to treat those you disagree with, with kindness and consideration. 5. Approach assignments, papers, and exams with integrity and academic honesty. 6. Take class notes. Partial power point slides will be available via Blackboard under \"documents.\" 7. Overall compliance with the Boise State University shared values: Academic Excellence, Caring, Citizenship, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, & Trustworthiness. Reading: It will be most helpful for you to complete your assigned reading prior to the scheduled class . Students will be held accountable for all the text and adjunct material assigned, even if not directly reviewed in the reading or lecture. You will be able to use the hard copy text and/or the ebook provided through Connect . The ebook is equipped with Smartbook technology that was developed to help you retain the material that you have read and to complete LearnSmart modules while you read. Attendance: If a student must miss a class session, she or he is expected to obtain notes from classmates and/or Blackboard (i.e. please do not email me asking for notes). If a student must miss a scheduled exam, she or he must follow the guidelines listed under \"exams.\" Attendance will be taken intermittently via Top Hat during the semester. Those students who attend at least 90% of the recorded attendance days will receive 10 extra credit points. LearnSmart Modules : The purpose of these study modules is to provide you with additional experience engaging with the course material outside of the classroom. You will be required to complete one module per chapter. The modules are open book/note and are to be completed outside of class v ia the Blackboard Assignments page. You will complete 12 modules for a total of 60 points (5 points per module), and you must complete each assigned problem set by 11:59pm on the due date. Each module is open book, supplements your reading, and is developed to take the average student approximately 45 minutes to complete, so please plan accordingly. When you click on your first LearnSmart module via Blackboard, you will be asked to set up your account with Connect . You should have purchased a Connect code that will allow you access. We will discuss many aspects of LearnsSmart in class, but the following page includes answers to many common questions students have: http://www.mhlearnsmart.com/einsteinmt/help/FAQ.html#_How_is_my . Interactive Case Studies : As an undergraduate student in a clinical psychology course, you have limited opportunities to interact with clients experiencing a psychological disorder; therefore, t he purpose of the Interactive Case Studies is to allow you the opportunity to interactively engage with potential clients in a mock \"interview\" and well as game-based format. During the course of the semester, you will be expected to complete case studies covering six different disorders. Each case study is worth 5 points for a total of 30 points. The case studies will allow you to learn more about specific disorders. The exercises are open book/note and are to be completed outside of class and can be accessed through the Assignments page on Blackboard. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 75 Abnormal: syllabus Spring 2016 (v1.0 1/7/16) 4 Extended Learning Assignment (ELA) Go to the Movies : Students will complete one writing assignment this semester. This assignment must be written in APA format and submitted via Blackboard. Late assignments will be accepted but 5 points/day will be deducted from the total score . See please closely read the section belo w for more specific details regarding the format and content of this assignment. Purpose: The purpose of this essay is to provide a method for you to engage in course material outside of class and have a forum for critical thinking and analysis. The ability to gather information, review the facts as well as anecdotal material, evaluate them, and then synthesize is critical for an upper-division level student in the psychological sciences. The ability to communicate ideas through writing is also an essential skill for students in all majors. For those studying the social sciences writing in APA format is an expectation both at the undergraduate and graduate levels. Requirements: As noted above you will be writing one paper for this course, which must be written in APA format (writing style of the American Psychological Association) . If you are unfamiliar with APA style, you will need to spend some additional time learning the basics. I strongly suggest that you schedule 40 minutes to watch a series of 8, 5-minute videos on APA style developed by Dr. Eric Landrum at: http://sspa.boisestate.edu/psychology/faculty- and-staff/landrum/ . Several other great resources are the Purdue Online Writing Lab APA style guide: http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/ and the APA style website http://www.apastyle.org/ .You can also access the full APA style guide at the Albertson's Library. We will review some of the common APA style errors in class before your first paper is due, and you will be expected to use correct APA style in your papers. All essays will be turned in through the assignments portal on Blackboard by midnight on the due date . Essays NOT submitted through Blackboard will not be graded and thus receive a grade of 0. Proper writing techniques (e.g. grammar, spelling, sentence construction) are expected. Students will benefit from enlisting proofreading by friends and classmates. All essays must be submitted in rich text (rtf) or docx format. General Content Formatting: *be written in APA style *be at least 3 typed, double-spaced pages but not more than 5 pages for the body. *have a cover page and reference page in APA style (not counted in the 3-5 pages of the body) *submitted in rtf or docx format *fully address the topic *be original to the student (not purchased via the internet or borrowed from a friend) ELA Essay Specifics: For this essay you are required to view one movie (documentary or popular) that depicts a person with a mental illness/disorder. A list of movies is posted for you on Blackboard . All movies listed are approved; however, if you want to watch a movie not on this list - approval is needed from Dr. Genuchi. The movies listed in the syllabus are selected due to their depiction of the mental illness, family dynamics , and other issues related to mental status. Some of the movies will have strong language, violence and/or intense scenes. It is possible to select a movie with minimal difficult material though. After watching the movie in its entirety, the student will complete the following for the essay: a. Provide a summary of the video b. Identify one character of focus (the one with symptoms) c. Discuss the symptoms observed in the movie and in what situations you observed those symptoms. d. Review the DSM-5 (2 copies are available in the Albertson's Library) for a diagnosis or diagnoses that best matches the character's symptoms. Only the actual DSM-5 is an acceptable reference, not a website or book that refers to the DSM-5 . For better or worse, movies and television contribute significantly to shaping the public's perception of the mentally ill and those who treat them. Steven E. Hyler CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 76 Abnormal: syllabus Spring 2016 (v1.0 1/7/16) 5 e. Using the process of differential diagnosis , discuss the possible DSM- 5 diagnosis or diagnoses for the character of focus and explain why this diagnosis is appropriate. f. Provide a specific rationale for your diagnosis by describing the character's behaviors and how those behaviors correspond with specific D SM-5 diagnostic criteria. Using the process of differential diagnosis, state how you ruled-out any similar or related diagnoses. g. Discuss how familiar, sex/gender, racial, ethnic, multicultural, economic, educational, or medical issues interacted with the character and her or his expression of the symptoms (e.g. failed a class because the character refused to give a speech in class due to anxiety). h. Evaluate the movie's accuracy depicting a person with a mental illness. Exams: There will be 4 exams given during the term (300 points total) . Exam material will be from the text, lecture material (note that there is some material that is covered in lecture only), video content, guest speaker content, and any other material assigned during the course. The exams will include a heavy emphasis on the application of course materials, such as identifying symptoms, treatments, and concepts through examples and case studies/vignettes. Each regular exam will include 75 multiple-choice questions. Exam Schedule: You will complete all of your exams in the Boise State Blackboard Testing Center, which is located on the fourth floor of the education building. The testing center is open from 8am to 8pm on the days exams are scheduled for this class. You will need to schedule your time to take the exams directly through the testing center during the following date ranges. Please see the blackboard testing center website for additional information and to schedule your testing time : http://ctl.boisestate.edu/idea/tools-and-facilities/online-testing-center/ 1. Exam 1 (Chapters 1, 2, 3): 2/4-2/5 2. Exam 2 (Chapters 4, 5, 7): 3/3-3/4 3. Exam 3 (Chapters 14, 12, 8): 4/4-4/5 4. Exam 4 (Chapters 9/11, 10, 16) : 5/3-5/5 Note: Sharing information regarding exam content prior to the final completion of the exam or turning in any work that was completed by anyone other than you is a violation of the Boise State University Student Code of Conduct regarding academic honesty (see below). A violation [of academic honesty] may include cheating, plagiarism, or other forms of academic dishonesty. All assignments submitted by a student must represent her/his own ideas, concepts, and current understanding or must cite the original source. Academic dishonesty includes assisting a student to cheat, plagiarize, or commit any act of academic dishonesty. Attempts to violate academic integrity do not have to be successful to be considered academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty includes turning in substantial portions of the same academic work to more than one course without the prior permission of the faculty members (Student Code of Conduct, Article 4, Section 1). Grading: The following is the proposed grading schedule: Exam Make -Up Policy : If a student must miss an exam for any reason, arrangemen ts must be made with Dr. Genuchi prior to the day of the scheduled exam. If an exam must be missed due to a personal emergency, Dr. Genuchi must be contacted by someone (not necessarily the student) prior to the start of the exam in order for the student to be given a make -up exam. If these steps are not followed, there will be no make -up exam. *Make-up exams may not be identical in format to the original exams .

Attendance: Students who achieve 90% attendance (or greater) on the days attendance is taken will receive 10 extra credit points . 2. During this course we will be discussing interventions for various psychological disorders. For extra credit, you have the opportunity to become more familiar with a specific psychosocial intervention. You may choose to complete one of the following two extra credit options (worth 20 points upon full completion). OPTION 1 : One primary intervention for a range of psychological concerns is individual counseling. To receive extra credit, you will meet with a counseling trainee in the BSU counselor education graduate program for two sessions of counseling (2 hours). The purpose of this experience is to provide you with an opportunity to experience a counseling environment and for the trainees to gain valuable counseling experience. What you discuss in the sessions is confidential, so I will receive no information on what you discuss. However, I will receive a summary report from the counseling department to inform me who completed two sessions. In order to receive credit for this assignment you must turn in a 1-2 page reflection paper (does not have to be formatted in APA style), via Blackboard, in which you describe your counseling experience . You might discuss some of the following: How did you feel before and after? What was the counselor like? Was the experience similar to or different than what you expected? What kind of questions were you asked? What did you like or dislike about the experience? I do not expect you to disclose any information about what you actually discussed in your sessions . If interested, you will sign up during class time (date TBA - usually during the first 2 weeks of class), and then you will be contacted by a counseling trainee via email. If you miss the sign-up date, it is your responsibility to contact the BSU counseling department and sign-up for extra credit. OPTION 2 : During the course of this semester, we will discuss a wide range of psychosocial and medical interventions for psychological disorders. To receive extra credit, you must write a 3-5 page research paper in APA style in which you describe a specific intervention for a psychological disorder. For example, you might discuss cognitive behavioral treatment of depression, Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder, graded exposure treatment for phobias, electroconvulsive therapy, antipsychotic medications, interpersonal therapy for depression, etc. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 81 Abnormal: syllabus Spring 2016 (v1.0 1/7/16) 10 Abnormal Psychology ELA Grading Rubric Here is the guide that I will use to grade your essays Points Possible Format 10 APA style used Neat Cover page included Reference page included Body a maximum of 5 pages/min 3 pages Grammar 20 Proper grammar used Good sentence and paragraph construction Accurate spelling Appropriate inclusive language Content 60 Covered all essay specific content areas from the syllabus Well organized Ideas flowed well throughout the paper Supported any hypotheses/conclusions made with source material from the actual DSM-5 Full rationale provided for diagnoses Examples from movie used to support the diagnoses Covered topic thoroughly Demonstrated an understanding of the topic References 10 Adequate number to cover topic cited correctly in text listed correctly on reference page Video title and source included in APA style in text and In the reference page (late) -5pts/day ____ ------------------------------------------------------------------- Total points _______/100 Letter grade ________ Comments: CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 82PSYC 331 and PSYC 331G: PSYCHOLOGY OF HEALTH Fall 2015 ILC 118 10:30-11:45 3 credit Directions to the TA office: CA 155: The TA office is in the old Health and Wellness building (the white round one that used to be a hamburger stand across University Dr. from the Public Affairs and Arts building).

CATALOG DESCRIPTION: Principles that have emerged from the experimental analysis of behavior will be examined. The principles include, but are not limited to, operant and classical conditioning. The course will deal with applications of these principles to the understanding and change of phobias, obesity, smoking, alcoholism, aberrant sexual behavior, and similar problems. PREREQ: PSYC 101, PSYC 295 or MATH 254 and upper division standing. COURSE OBJECTIVES: This course will focus upon how biological, psychological, cultural, and social factors affect health and illness. We will discuss the best ways to promote healthy living and prevent disease and how people react psychologically when they are diagnosed with CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 83an illness or asked to make lifestyle changes (e.g., controlling cholesterol, starting an exercise program). We will also cover the influence of stress, coping, personality, culture, and family influences on health as well as health intervention at the level of individual, family, and community. We will discuss not only how individuals with different cultural backgrounds (race, ethnicity, country of origin) face different health issues, but also how cultural differences may affect adherence to prevention and treatment plans. Finally, we will discuss how health promotion and education messages need to be sensitive to individuals from differing cultural, educational, and social backgrounds and discuss how to best target health messages to differing groups of individuals. LEARNING OUTCOMES: At the successful completion of this course, students will be able to understand and communicate: basic research methodologies used by health psychologists the importance of psychosocial factors in health outcomes the importance of cultural factors in health outcomes and intervention methods their own health risks how to design an effective health intervention for themselves or a segment of the community how treatment protocols are changing in America today (e.g., CAM) allow students to better empathize with current health issues faced by the community Email Policy When emailing a TA, please contact the TA who is assigned to your last name. You should email a TA if you have questions about the syllabus, content discussed in class, or assignments. You should email me if you have any personal questions or questions that extend beyond what was discussed in class.

COURSE OVERVIEW: Class meetings will combine lecture, discussion, demonstrations, activities, and video clips. The basic lecture notes can be found on Blackboard at http://blackboard.boisestate.edu under the Course Documents/Lecture Notes folder. We will be using the \"clickers\" regularly in order to make each session interactive; I encourage questions and comments. You are responsible for all information presented in each meeting, even when you are absent. ATTENDANCE: Regular attendance is expected and attendance will be taken at each class using your Clickers. Note: You have a one week grace period to purchase and register your clicker. Thereafter you are responsible for bringing it to class every day for attendance purposes. Attendance questions will be thrown in at random times during the CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 84lectures. There will be approximately 150 attendance questions throughout the semester. However, total attendance points will be 160 - thus if you miss class a few times, you will not l ose points. If you miss a class, you should obtain notes from a classmate because you will be responsible to know this information for e xams. Note that a portion of these attendance points have be en allocated to the last few weeks of class, as I expect you to attend all final project presentations as well as the graduate student presentations. QUIZZES: There will be 12 weekly 5-item quizzes worth 10 points each (2 pts per question) over the module materials. Quizzes will c onsist of multiple choice questions, true/false, and/or matching. All quizzes will be timed (1 minute per question) and taken on your own time via BB. The quiz will automatically close when your time is up. Quizzes open each Tuesday after class and remain open until Sunday at midnight. As you have five full days to take each quiz, make-up quizzes will not be allowed. You may drop your lowest quiz score. If you have a disability or language problem that might hinder your performance on exams, please let us know prior to the first quiz. With documentation, arrangements may be made for an alternative quiz. EXAMS: There will be four exams worth 100 points each over the material from lecture, the text, and any films shown in class. Exams will consist of 35 multiple choice questions worth 2 points each and 3 short answer que stions worth 10 points each (you will be allowed to pick 3 of 5 short answers) . Approximately one-third of the material on the exams will be from the quizzes and two-thirds from the text and lecture. All exams will be given on-line in the Blackboard testing center on the 4th floor of the Education building. You must schedule your ex am with the testing center. You cannot simply show up and take it due to the size of the class. To schedule your exam, go to: https://atapps.boisestate.edu/elearning/testinglab/student/scheduler/default.asp . You will have a one week timeframe in which to take each exam. Make sure you take your exam during the allotted week. Make up exams will not be allowed. If you have a disability or language problem that might hinder your performance on exams, please let me know prior to the first exam.

CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 852) Write a two page double-spaced perspective paper analyzing your results and list and desc ribe in detail three ways you could easily make positive changes in your health based on your results (e.g., floss daily, wearing your seat belt, cut back on nicotine, exercise for 30 min 3/week, eat more fish, etc.; 10 pts). This paper is due Tuesday, September 8th in class and is worth 15 points. Paper 2 Pick one health be havior from your real age test that you intend to change. Pick a model (e.g., transtheoretical model, theory of planned behavior) of behavior change to help you design an intervention. Find 3-5 references (at least 3 of these must be journal articles) that pertain to your intervention (e.g., health belief model effectiveness, what works when trying to quit smoking, etc.). Write a 4-6 page research paper (not including the title page and reference page) that describes the literature concerning your intervention as well as a proposed intervention (think intro and method of a research methods paper). This intervention should be something you could reasonably do over the next month. This paper should be APA style. This pap er is due in class Thursday October 15th and is worth 50 points. See grading rubric in the Assignmen ts folder on BB.

This paper is due Thursday, November 12th in class and is worth 35 points. See grading rubric in the Assi gnments folder on BB. SERVICE LEARNING: To better reinforce course theory and to learn more about the health issues faced by our community, students in this course are required to complete 15-20 hours of Service Learning at a local agency (see SL under the BB Assignments folder). Note: You must sign up for an SL agency by 5pm on September 4th as orientations begin the following week. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 86 GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECT: In addition to the other course requirements, graduate students will be required to give a 30-minute presentation on a health topic of their choice/expertise. Students will present topic ideas to Dr. Pritchard for approval by the third week of class and we will work together to decide where the presentation would best fit. This is worth 100 points of your final course grade. Rough drafts of presentations are due one week prior to presentation date. ACADEMIC DISHONESTY: Academic integrity is very important to me. Cheating in any form detracts from your learning and is not fair to your classmates. Thus, all assignments and exams must be your own work. The Student Code of Conduct, which includes information on academic dishonesty and describes the reporting and the Conduct hearing processes, can be found at: http://deanofstudents.boisestate.edu/student-code-of-conduct/ . Please familiarize yourself with this information. All instances of misconduct (e.g., cheating on a quiz or an exam, plagiarizing a paper) will receive a zero for the assignment/exam/quiz and be reported to the Student Conduct Office. REALITY CHECK: We want you to succeed in this course, but you need to realize that this is a 300 level course, and, as such, the expectations for the quality and quantity of your work are substantially greater than for a 100 level course. For some students, this may require a significant increase in the effort you must apply to study in order to be successful in the course. We expect that you know how to utilize library and internet resources of sufficient quality and credibility to write a high quality paper. We expect that you will properly cite all sources used in your papers. We also expect that your papers will demonstrate that you have thought about the concepts and not just regurgitated your sources. Thus, you should minimize the use of quotations in your papers. It is not unusual to have some difficulty in the transition from a 100 level course to a 300 level course. Thus, if you are unclear about our expectations or how to best study or manage your time to complete the work required for this course, please come see us during office hours. If you are concerned about your writing, I would also encourage you to go to the Writing Center and/or turn in drafts of your pa pers early to us for feedback. STATEMENT OF SHARED VALUES: We will be discussing a few controversial issues in this course. I value your input on these and any other issues we may discuss in class. I want to create a safe place for you to vocalize your opinions. Thus, we will abide by Boise State's statement of shared values in this course (http://president.boisestate.edu/values/statement-of-shared-values/ ). Boise State University is committed to personal and social development, educational excellence, and civic engagement. Membership in the campus community is a privilege and requires its members to conduct themselves ethically with integrity and civility. Campus community members enjoy the same rights and freedoms that all U.S. citizens enjoy, including personal responsibility for one's own conduct, behavior and speech. CONSENT AGENDA DECEMBER 15, 2016 CONSENT - SDE TAB 10 Page 87In a culture of intellectual inquiry and debate, where the search for knowledge and discovery flourish, campus community members are expected to demonstrate civility, abide by norms of decorum, and adhere to the principles of civil discourse. \"Being civil means being constantly aware of others and weaving restraint, respect and consideration into the very fabric of this awareness,\" (Forni, 2002, p. 9). Higher education has the duty to educate students to be responsible citizens. Boise State strives to provide a culture of civility and success where all feel safe and free from discrimination, harassment, threats or intimidation. Boise State University upholds the following values as the foundation for a civil and nurturing environment. Campus community members are expected to adhere to these common values (Josephson, 2002). Academic Excellence - engage in our own learning and participate fully in the academic community's pursuit of knowledge. Caring - show concern for the welfare of others. Citizenship - uphold civic virtues and duties that prescribe how we ought to behave in a self-governing community by obeying laws and policies, volunteering in the community, and staying informed on issues. Fairness - expect equality, impartiality, openness and due process by demonstrating a balanced standard of justice without re ference to individual bias. Respe ct - treat people with dignity regardless of who they are and what they believe. A respectful person is attentive, listens well, treats others with consideration and doesn't resort to intimidation, coercion or violence to persuade. Responsibility - take charge of our choices and actions by showing accountability and not shifting blame or taking improper credit. We will pursue excellence with diligence, perseverance, and continued improvement. Trustworthiness - demonstrate honesty in our communication and conduct while managing ourselves with integrity and reliability.

BACKGROUND The regular meetings of the Board are currently rotated between each of the eight public postsecondary institution campuses, such that the four year institutions host a Board meeting each year and the community colleges and Eastern Idaho Technical College host Board meetings every other year. The current rotation schedule allows for Board members to be on campus at least once each year and allows for residents in each of the areas to attend a Board meeting without traveling to Boise. At the February 2016 regular Board meeting the Board discussed the possibility of changing the rotation schedule to one where the institutions would host each meeting based on the same schedule while the physical location would only be on the institutions campus every other year. During the off -year the hosting institution would host the Board meeting at a location in the Treasure Valley. Travel to north and east Idaho can be time consuming and expensive due to the limited availability of flights and long distances. Board members and institution staff have both expressed an interest in reducing cost and time by conducting more of the meetings in the Boise area where it is easier to travel to, regardless of which part of the state in which they ma y reside. In February 2016, the Board discussed the idea and concerns were expressed that as the Board of Regents or Board of Trustees for those institutions that are under the Board's direct governance the proposed schedule could result in a disconnect of Board members from the institutions and their communities. As a result of that discussion the Board choose not to change the current rotation and instituted a change in the typical Board meeting schedule that allowed for a tour of the hosting campus at the star t of each regular Board meeting. The Board has followed the new schedule for almost one year now and the item is being brought back for re consideration and feedback on how the new meeting schedule, incorporating the campus tours , have been received. IMPACT Approval of the new rotation schedule would result in future meetings being hosted by an institution on the current schedule, however, approximately half of the regular meetings would be held in the Treasure Valley area. STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMENDATIONS At the February 2016 regular Board meeting staff proposed the following rotation schedule: PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 20 16 PPGA TAB 2 Page 2 February 2017 - Boise (BSU) April 2017 - B oise (UI) May 2017 - Retreat June 2017 - Coeur d' Alene (NIC) August 2017 - Boise (ISU) October 2017 - Lewiston (LCSC) December 2017 - Twin Falls (CSI) February 2018 - Boise (BSU) April 2018 - Moscow (UI) May 2018 - Retreat June 2018 - Idaho Falls (EITC) August 2018 - Pocatello (ISU) October 2018 - Lewiston (LCSC) December 2018 - Nampa (CWI) The proposal was discussed at the December 6, 2016 Presidents' Council meeting, with mixed feelings by the presidents . Should the Board move to a schedule where institution campuses where visited every other year rather than every year, Boise State University has offered their campus facilities should any of the hosting institutions wish to hold the meeting on Boise State University's campus. The final decision on the actual facilities would be up to the hosting institution, so as long as any such facility could meet the Board meeting requirements. Should the Board indicate they would like to move to a rotation schedule as described herein, staff would bring back a final location rotation schedule through the Rolling Calendar at the next Board meeting. The start date for the rotations would be subject to suitable facilities being located within the Treasure Valley on the currently approved meeting dates.

PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 3 Page 1 SUBJECT Results - Public School Funding Formula Interim Committee Survey APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY HCR 33, 63rd Idaho Legislature, 2nd Regular Session (2016) BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The Idaho State Board of Education and the Idaho Legislature's Public School Funding Formula Interim Committee (Interim Committee) partnered to collect public input from Idahoans on how the state's public schools are funded. Starting Tuesday, October 4, 2016, through Sunday, October 23, 2016, an online public opinion survey was available for any Idaho citizen to provide comments and opinions regarding how public school districts and public charter schools in the state are funded. The survey was developed in support of the work of the Interim Committee, which is charged with undertaking a complete study of the public school funding formula and mak ing recommendations for improvement . The Interim C ommittee will evaluate the existing formula to assess how it meets the needs of different learning modalities, serves Idaho students, and provides fiscal stability to public school districts and public charter schools. The Interim C ommittee was established at the passage of HCR 33 during the 2016 legislative session. In addition to members of the House and Senate, the committee member ship includes a member of the State Board of Education (Dr. Linda Clark) and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Sherri Ybarra. IMPACT The results of the survey can be used to identify trends in opinions regarding the state's public school funding formula. The survey findings, along with other policy research conducted by the committee provide important background information that can assist in forming recommendations by the Interim Committee. STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The Governor's Task Force for Improving Education recommended a change to the public school funding formula from Average Daily Attendance to Average Daily Enrollment/Membership. The Public School Funding Subcommittee tasked with further developing the recommendation concluded that rather than focus solely on funding based on attendance or enrollment, the entire funding formally needed to be addressed. The public schools funding formula significantly changed between 1994 and 1996, in part as a response to \"adequacy and equity\" lawsuits filed in 1991. Since that time the various section of Idaho Code that establish public school funding have had amendments to specific sections in an attempt to address isolated issues, however, a systemic look at how public schools are funded in Idaho has not been conducted since that time. The Subcommittee also concluded that a potential change of such magnitude would take significant legislative buy in and support. PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENT AL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 3 Page 2 The Interim Committee has been tasked with studying the current public school funding structure and making recommendations to the Legislature on possible amendments. The current funding formula is being evaluated to assess its ability to address the variety of learning modalities available to students as well as increased student mobility.

PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 1 5, 2016 PPGA TAB 4 Page 1 SUBJECT Direct Admissions Report REFERENCE August 2015 Board approved the Direct Admission benchmark November 2015 First Direct Admissions letters mailed to students and parents February 2016 Deadline for applying under the Direct Admissions program BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The Direct Admissions program was designed to remove barriers for students choosing to attend an Idaho public institution. Through data already collected in the Educational Analytics System of Idaho (EASI), high school seniors could be proactively admitted to Idaho public postsecondary institutions. Through working with the Provosts and Vice Presidents of Academic Affairs at each public institution, a benchmark score consisting of a student's grade point average and college entrance exam scores was adopted. Students meeting the agreed upon benchmark would be accepted at all eight of the Idaho public institutions. Students not meeting the benchmark would be admitted to six of the Idaho public institutions. The first letters to students and parents were sent in November 2015. A follow -up survey was sent to those students who applied to an Idaho public institution by the February deadline. This report looks at the enrollment behavior and results from the follow -up survey. IMPACT Recognizing the recruitment efforts by each institution, it is impossible to identify how much of the enrollment growth is caused by the Direct Admissions program. The data suggest s that Direct Admissions played a role in the increases seen across the Idaho public institutions where fall 2016 growth by Idaho students who graduated high school within 12 months grew by 6.7% statewide over fall 2015. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Draft Direct Admissions Report Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Board staff will be prepared to answer questions that the Board may have regarding the Direct Admissions program. BOARD ACTION This item is for informational purposes only. Any action will be at the Board's discretion.

This program allowed the State Board to proactively admit students into Idaho's public postsecondary institutions by considering a high school student's college entrance exam score, total credits earned, and cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) through the end of the student's junior year. Group of 6 vs. Group of 8 Based on a student's total credits earned, cumulative GPA, and college entrance exam (SAT/ACT) score, students and paren ts were sent a letter indicating that the student had been accepted to all eight public institutions or six public institutions. These institutions can be seen in the following table. Group of 6 Group of 8 College of Southern Idaho College of Southern Idaho College of Western Idaho College of Western Idaho Eastern Idaho Technical College Eastern Idaho Technical College Lewis -Clark State College Lewis -Clark State College North Idaho College North Idaho College Idaho State University - College of Technology Idaho State University Boise State University University of Idaho For the graduating class of 2015, letters were sent to 20,574 seniors and parents/guardians. The following chart identifies how many students received each type of letter. Enrollment The Office of the State Board of Education calculates enrollment based on a point -in-time. This census date for the fall semester is October 15 th. The following table shows the enrollment for the class of 2015 (prior to Direct Admissio ns) and the class of 2016 at the subsequent census date.

After Direct Admissions had been implemented, that number increased to 5,712 or a growth of 358. That growth represents a 6.7% increase. Increases were seen at both 4 -year institutions and 2 -year institutions. The appeals window for graduation data for the class of 2016 has not yet closed, so calculating the percentage of graduates going to postsecondar y is not possible at this time. Qualitative Analysis In April 2015, a survey was set to 8,343 students who were set to graduate from high school that spring and had already applied to college for the fall semester. Seventeen percent of students surveyed responded. Approximately 75% of students surveyed responded that they discussed the Direct Admissions letter with a parent or guardian. This was in contrast to approximately 25% who responded that they discussed the letter with a teacher or counselor. After students received their letters, the number of students considering out -of- state or private institutions dropped by almost 20 percentage points. More than 30% of students surveyed indicated that Direct Admissions had medium -to-high impact on their de cision to attend college. Direct Admissions was a factor in students' decisions, but it was not the most important factor. Surveyed students responded that their top three considerations on selecting the school they attended were: 1. The degree programs or courses offered 2. The cost of attending the particular institution 3. The perceived return on investment 74.5%25.5%Did you discuss the Direct Admissions letter with your parents or guardians?

August 2016 Board approved FY18 Line Items, including funding for the Adult Completers Scholarship September 23, 2016 Board approved 2017 Legislative Agenda October 2016 Board received an update from the STEM Action Center, including benefits on the establishment of a public school STEM designation. BACKGROUND/ DISCUSSION The Board approved legislative ideas for the 2017 legislative session at the June 2016 regular Board meeting and the Board's 2017 Legislative agenda at a special Board meeting on September 23, 2016. In addition to this process the Board will also regularly choose to support other education related legislation. Board staff have been working with the Governor's Office to develop legislation supporting the Board's FY2018 Line Item request for funding for an Adult Completers Scholarship. The proposed legislation is in alignment with legislation introduced by the Governor's Office during the 2016 legislative session that was supported by the Board. Additionally, Board staff has done some preliminary work in collaboration with the Governor's Office and STEM Action Center staff to develop a program that recognizes quality STEM schools or programs. While the Board already has the authority to set STEM school standards for a uniform and thorough system of public education, the program envisioned through the proposed legislation would provide a mechanism to incentivize schools and districts to develop high quality STEM programs and meet quality STEM program standards. Adult Completers Scholarship This legislation would establish the Adult Postsecondary Completion Scholarship to help Idaho residents return to school and complete their academic studies. The scholarship is intended to support adult students returning to a public college or university after an absence of at least three (3) years or more and who are completing their first undergraduate degree. Applicants may qualify for up to $3,000 per academic year for up to eight (8) consecutive semesters. Applicants must meet the following criteria in order to be eligible for consideration: \u00b7 Must be a resident of the state of Idaho. \u00b7 Must enroll as a student at an Idaho public higher education institution seeking a first undergraduate degree or certificate. PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 5 Page 2 \u00b7 Must be an undergraduate reentry student who has experienced a gap (three full academic years or more) in the pursuit of postsecondary education. \u00b7 Must have a minimum of 24 credits earned from any institution toward a degree (must be transcriptable credits). \u00b7 Must demonstrate financial need as determined by the Estimated Family Contribution (EFC) calculation on a completed FAFSA. \u00b7 Must be registered at least part time: a minimum of 6 credits per semester. Fiscal Impact: $3 million ongoing General Fund appropriation to fund scholarship awards as well as im plementation costs of the program. In addition, ongoing General Fund of $92,000, of which $89,000 is for salary and benefits, $3,000 for Operating Expenditures, and $3,000 for one- time Capital Outlay to the State Board of Education to cover salary, benefits and operation costs for this program. STEM School Designation This bill provides an opportunity for public schools to earn a STEM school designation or STEM program designation. This bill defines terms, creates the STEM designation for public schools, requires the State Board of Education and STEM Action Center to collaborate to develop the requirements for a STEM designation and to implement an annual process for review of schools and programs seeking a STEM designation. STEM schools and programs have gained popularity in recent years. Setting a common minimum standard for earning a STEM designation will help to inform parents and students about the quality and expectations of the schools or programs in which they are enrolling their students. A uniform STEM designation will assure a minimum quality standard. Fiscal Impact: The STEM school designation will be funded through existing funds appropriated to the STEM Action Center. Appropriated funds will be provided to help schools attain the standards established to receive the STEM designation and will be granted to schools who have received the STEM designation to sustain high quality STEM programs and educator professional development. Schools would be assessed by a third party reviewer and awards granted based on their progression toward the STEM designation. Estimates are based on the number of schools currently self -identified as STEM schools.

February 2015, Board approved the second reading of proposed changes to the Board Bylaws, incorporating the Athletic Committee. June 2016, Board approved the first reading of the Board Bylaws, amending the program approval sunset clause. August 2016 Board approved the second reading of the Board Bylaws, amending the program approval sunset clause. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies and Procedures - Bylaws BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Board Officers are elected by the Board annually. Currently Officers are selected at the regular June Board meeting. The date for the election of officers is not established in the Board bylaws and may be set for any properly noticed Board meeting at the direction of the Board President. The current June cycle is predicated by the fact that Board member terms, in their final year, terminate on June 30 th. Previously , the election of Board Officers had been held at the regular April Board meeting or at the annual May Board Retreat. April elections were held at a time when Board terms expired on February 28 th. Nominations for positions are taken from the floor at the time of the election. There is currently no formal nomination process. There are no established term limits for officers or length of service restrictions for eligibility to be an officer. Following the 2016 Board Officers elections it was requested that Board staff explore options for establishing a more formal process for soliciting nominations for Board Officer positions. All standing committees of Board members are established in the Board's bylaws along with the Board's operations procedures. The creation of a Nomination Committee would need to be established through amendments to the Board's bylaws. IMPACT The proposed amendments would create a new standing committee of the Board, made of the Board officers and past President. The committee would have the responsibility of soliciting nominations for the annual election of officers. PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15 , 2016 PPGA TAB 6 Page 2 ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Bylaws - First Reading Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Board staff have researched a variety of governing board's officer nominating processes and procedures, including the Association of Governing Boards recommendations on committee structures and Board governance. The majority of board's that have formal nominating committees are governing boards with much larger membership than Idaho's Board of Education membership. In most cases these boards meet throughout the year and gather information on the qualifications of each board member, and based on those qualifications the nominating committee will then make nominat ions for open positions on the board. Additionally, it is common for nominating committees for these larger boards to not only make recommendations for board officers , but to also provide nominations for open seats on the boards. N ominations from these c ommittees were generally due from 30 to 60 days prior to the election of officers, and were either made to the board president or chairperson or to the board as a whole.

Sec. 106 (\"Title IX\"), prohibit discrimin ation on the basis of sex in federally funded education programs and activities. Title IX protects students, employees, applicants for admission and employment, and campus visitors from all forms of sexual harassment, including sexual violence and gender -based harassment . All public and private elementary and secondary schools, school districts , and colleges and universities receiving any federal financial assistance must comply with Title IX . Following approval of the second reading of Board Policy, I.T. Title IX, institution staff brought up possible concerns regarding the potential for a student, charged with misconduct , including Title IX violations , to continue to appeal to the Board after they have exhausted the appeals process established at the institution and the potential harm this could cause the victim. Specific concerns raised by the institutions included: 1. The institutions ' own policies already allow students to appeal procedural issues. Another appeal on this issue is not necessary. 2. Students would raise the issue of procedural error as a further delay technique to stretch out the appeal process. 3. In Title IX cases, allowing students an appeal to the Board could result in further trauma to the complainant by forcing the complainant to r elive the incident and further delaying recovery. The proposed amendments to Board Policy I.T. correct the reporting requirement The institutions are required to notify students of time frames relevant to investigations as well as to those applicable to h earings . The proposed PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15 , 2016 PPGA TAB 8 Page 2 amendments to Board Policy III.P.

Students STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The initial request from the institutions was a restriction on all student appeals to the Board regarding student misconduct. After discussion with the legal counsel at the institutions and the Board's legal counsel , the staff recommendation is to limit appeals to the Board regarding cases of student misconduct except those that fall within the provided exceptions. Should the Board choose to hear a student misconduct appeal related to Title IX, the Board would need t o have specific training related to hearing these types of appeals. Institutions will be providing a report to the Board at the February Board meeting detai ling their internal appeal processes and implementation of Board Policy I.T. Title IX .

The Board designates its Executive Director as the Bo ard's representative for reviewing student complaints/grievances, and authorizes the Executive Director, after such review, to issue the decision of the Board based on such review. The Executive Director may, in his/her discretion, refer any matter to the Board for final action/decision. b. A current or former student at a postsecondary educational institution under the governance of the Board may request that the Executive Director review any final institutional decision relating to a complaint or grievance (except as set forth under paragraph c) instituted by such student related to such individual's attendance at the institution. The student must have exhausted the complaint/grievance resolution procedures that have been established at the institution leve l. The Executive Director will not review complaints/grievances that have not been reported to the institution, or processed in accordance with the institution's complaint/grievance resolution procedures. c. Student complaints or grievances involving an inst itution's code of student conduct shall not be appealable to the Board unless the basis of the appeal is a claim that the institution has : i. committed a procedural error which has resulted in an unjust application of the code of student conduct; ii. failed to consider relevant evidence that could significantly impact the outcome o f the case ; iii. issued a sanction which is substantially disproportionate to the findings. c.d. A request for review must be submitted in writing to the Board office to the attention of the Chief Academic Officer, and must contain a clear and concise statement of the reason(s) for Board review. Such request must be received in the Board office no la ter than thirty (30) calendar days after the student receives the institution's final decision on such matter. The student has the burden of establishing that the final decision made by the institution on the grievance/complaint was made in error. A requ est for review must include a copy of the original grievance and all proposed resolutions and recommended decisions PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15 , 2016 PPGA TAB 8 Page 7 issued by the institution, as well as all other documentation necessary to demonstrate that the student has strictly followed the complaint/ grievance resolution procedures of the institution. The institution may be asked to provide information to the Board office related to the student complaint/grievance. d.e. The Chief Academic Officer will review the materials submitted by all parties and make a determination of recommended action, which will be forwarded to the Executive Director for a full determination. A review of a student complaint/grievance will occur as expeditiously as possible. e.f. The Board office may request that the student and/or institution provide additional information in connection with such review. In such event, the student and/or institution must provide such additional information promptly. f.g. The Board's Executive Director will issue a written decision as to whether the institution's decision with regard to the student's complaint/grievance was proper or was made in error. The Executive Director may uphold the institution's decision, overturn the institution's decision, or the Executive Director may remand the matter back t o the institution with instructions for additional review. Unless referred by the Executive Director to the Board for final action/decision, the decision of the Executive Director is final.

PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 10 Page 1 SUBJECT Educator Preparation Programs Performance Measures and Definition - Low Performing REFERENCE October 2016 Board was updated on progress made toward developing educator preparation program effectiveness/performance measures. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Higher Education Act of 1965, \u00a7\u00a7207 (2008). BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Annually, the Office of the State Board of Education (Board) certifies and submits Idaho's Title II report to the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE). The report includes data from public and private teacher preparation programs authorized by the State Board of Education to prepare individuals for certification in Idaho. On October 16, 2016 the USDOE released the revised Title II requirements. The rule imposes new reporting measures \u2014beyond the basics required for annual reports under the Higher Education Act \u2014which identify levels of program effectiveness to drive continuous improvement. The final federal regulations incorporate extensive stakeholder and public feedback obtained throughout four years of federal negotiated rulemaking, public hearings, and public comment processes. The intent of the new rule is to promote transparency about the effectiveness of all educator preparation providers (traditional, alternative routes, and distance) by requiring states to report annually \u2014at the program level\u2014on the following measures: \u00b7 Feedback from graduates and their employers on the effectiveness of program preparation; and \u00b7 Student learning outcomes measured by novice teachers' student growth, teacher evaluation results, and/or another state- determined measure that is relevant to students' outcomes, including academic performance, and meaningfully differentiates amongst teachers; and \u00b7 Placement and retention rates of graduates in their first three years of teaching, including placement and retention in high- need schools; and \u00b7 Other program characteristics, including assurances that the program has specialized accreditation or graduates candidates with content and pedagogical knowledge, and quality clinical preparation, who have met rigorous exit requirements. States are allowed flexibility in determining how to weigh all outcome measures, but are required to categorize program effectiveness using at least three levels of performance (effective, at -risk, and low -performing). These new federal PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 10 Page 2 requirements are designed to facilitate ongoing feedback amongst programs, prospective teachers, schools and districts, states and the public. In early 2013, while the proposed Title II (Higher Education Act) rule was moving through the process of negotiated rulemaking at the federal level, Idaho's educator preparation prov iders were already meeting regularly to develop common assessments and create consistency in measuring program outcomes. The Idaho measures were shaped in alignment with the proposed federal rule and, as a result, the rubric developed through the Idaho Coalition for Educator Preparation (ICEP) and the Idaho Association of Colleges of Teacher Education (IACTE ) for measuring program performance is in full compliance with the newly initiated Title II requirements. The attached document illustrates these proposed performance measures , aligned with federal guidance and recommended by ICEP, IACTE, and the Profess ional Standards Commission ( PSC), for the purpose of establishing a system for reporting varying ranges of program performance. New Title II State Reporting requirements will become effective no later than October 2019. IMPACT If the Board approves the measures recommended, as outlined in Attachment 1, Board staff will take next steps to convene the requisite stakeholder s for the purpose of consultation as prescribed by Title II guidance. This \"consultation group\" will be charged with making final recommendations on implementation of the EPP performance assessment system and data collection processes, as well as suggest state -level rewards or consequences associated with the designated performance levels . Feedback and recommendations from this group shall be vetted by the PSC for formal recommendation, and will be presented to the Board at a future meeting. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Draft Idaho Educator Preparation providers Evaluation Plan - Title II Aligned Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS At minimum, states must use the 2016 -17 academic year to design their reporting system in consultation with stakeholders. They may choose to use 2017- 18 as a pilot year and are required to fully implement the system in 2018 -19. For programs not performing at an \"effective\" level, federal consequences outline that such programs will become ineligible for the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) grants. The first year for which any program m ight lose TEACH grant eligibility will be 2021 -22. The TEACH grant program is a federal program that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who agree to teach for four years in an elementary or secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low -income families. PLANNING, POLICY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 PPGA TAB 10 Page 3 Additional federal guidance requires states to provide technical assistance to any program rated as low -performing to help it improve. With the Board's support of these recommended measures, progress can be made toward a full pilot in 2017- 18, which will allow for close review of this system prior to mandatory implementation. To ensure accuracy and consistency in evaluating educator preparation programs , adjustments to current data reporting and data collection will likely be necessary. A dditionally, a pilot year will also allow for discussion and strategic planning as the state education agency considers how to meet the technical assistance requirement in a way that will most effectively support low- performing programs.

Auditing standards1 require that the auditor communicate, either orally or in writing, certain information to an audit committee of the board, or another designated party that performs oversight of the financial reporting and audit process. This section discusses the type of information independent auditors are required to communicate to an audit committee or other oversight body. Independent Auditors in the Public Sector Communications with the audit committees have now engendered more legal and regulatory scrutiny. Independent auditors, in the wake of well-documented business failures and new regulatory oversight, are required to increase their documentation and communication efforts as they relate to their interactions with the audit committee. Independent auditors of government organizations may include an elected or appointed auditor or Inspector General or an independent public accounting firm. In addition, at the federal level the Government Accountability Office (GAO - formerly the Gene ral Accounting Office) may be statutorily required to act as the independent auditor in certain circumstances. If an independent public accounting firm is used as the independent auditor, it is often required to be under contract with the elected or appointed auditor or Inspector General. The communication guidance discussed in this section relates to whichever of the above parties is acting as the independent auditor. Auditor's Responsibility Under Genera lly Accepted Auditing Standards It is important for audit committees to understand what an audit is and what it is not. Usually, audit committees are most concerned about the system of internal control and that the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The auditor should make sure the audit committee understands the level of responsibility that the auditor assumes for the system of internal control and the financial statements under generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). It is also important that the auditor makes sure that the audit committee understands that an audit is designed to obtain reasonable rather than absolute assurance about the financial statements. 1 The term \"auditing standards\" refers to generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) issued by the AICPA. These standards are incorporated into government auditing sta ndards (GAS or GAGAS) issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. These terms are also synonymous w ith the term \"Yellow Book.\" In addition, OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements, Section 5 requires open and timely communication between agency management, including the CFO, and the Inspector General (and the audit firm if the audit is contracted out) throughout the audit process. The guidance in this tool is based on Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 61, Communication With Audit Committees , as amended; No. 60, Communication of Internal Control Related Matters Noted in an Audit (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1, AU sec. 325); and No. 54, Illegal Acts by Clients (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1, AU sec. 317), and amendments th ereto, which are in effect as of this writing and Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 6AICPA Audit Committee Toolkit: Government 2 Significant Accounting Policies The auditor should determine that the audit committee is informed about all significant accounting policies and how they are applied in the governmental organization. To make sure, the audit committee should expect that the auditors will communicate the following: 1. All significant accounting policies, including those that applied for the first time during the year 2. How those accounting policies are applied in the organization 3. Methods the organization used to account for significant unusual transactions 4. The effect of significant accounting policies in controversial or emerging areas for which there is lack of authoritative guidance or consensus Management Judgments and Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management. These estimates are based on management's judgments (which are normally based on management's knowledge and experience about past and current events), and assumptions about future events. The auditor should address the following issues with the audit committee: 1. The process used by management in formulating particularly sensitive accounting estimates 2. The basis for the auditor's conclusion about the reasonableness of those estimates Audit Adjustments The auditor should inform the audit committee about all audit adjustments arising from the audit that could, in the auditor's judgment, have a significant effect on the organization's financial reporting process. The audit team will keep track of those proposed adjustments for later discussion with management. Management will evaluate those proposed adjustments and decide whether the adjustment should be booked to the account balances as proposed. Bear in mind, however, that the auditor may find it necessary to qualify the audit report if management does not record the adjustments that the auditor deems necessary to record. As part of its communications, the auditor should: ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 7 Discussions to Expect Fr om the Independent Auditors 3 1. Inform the audit committee about adjustments arising from the audit that could either individually or in the aggregate have a significant effect on the organization's financial reporting process. 2. Address whether the adjustments were recorded. 3. Determine whether the adjustments may not have been detected except through the auditing procedures performed (meaning that the organization's own internal control system did not detect the need for the adjustment). 4. Explain about uncorrected misstatements aggregated by the auditor during the current engagement and pertaining to the most recent period presented in the financial statements, that were determined by management to be immaterial, both individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole. Auditor's Judgments About the Quality of the Organization's Accounting Principles Note: This communication is required for audits of public companies. It is not required for governmental organizations but could be considered a good practice. Although objective criteria for evaluating the quality of an organization's accounting practices have not been established, the auditor's judgments about the quality, not just the acceptability of the organization's accounting principles as applied in its financial statements, including disclosures, should be discussed. The discussion should be open and frank, and tailored to the organization's specific circumstances. It should include the following topics: 1. Consistency of the organization's accounting principles and their application 2. Clarity of the financial statements and related disclosures 3. Completeness of the financial statements and related disclosures 4. Any items that have a significant impact on the representational faithfulness, verifiability, and neutrality of the accounting information included in the financial statements, examples of which follow: a. Selection of new accounting policies or changes to current ones b. Estimates, judgments, and uncertainties c. Unusual transactions d. Accounting policies relating to significant financial statement items, including the timing of transactions and the period in which they are recorded 5. A discussion of accounting practices that are not specifically addressed in the accounting literature, for example, those that may be unique to a specific industry. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 8AICPA Audit Committee Toolkit: Government 4 Other Information Contained in Audited Financial Statements Although the notes to the financial statements are an integral part of the financial statements and therefore are included in the scope of the auditing procedures, other information prepared by management that generally accompanies financial statements is not necessarily included in the scope of the auditing procedures, for example, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" The auditor should discuss the responsibility, if any, that he or she has for other information in documents containing audited financial statements, any procedures performed, and the results. Disagreements With Management Disagreements may arise between the auditor and management over the application of accounting principles to specific transactions and events, as well as the basis for management's judgments about accounting estimates, or even the scope of the audit or disclosures to be made in the financial statements or footnotes. Diffe rences of opinion based on incomplete facts or preliminary information that are later resolved are not considered disagreements for this purpose. When meeting with the audit committee, the auditors should discuss any disagreements with management, whether or not resolved, about matters that individually or in the aggregate could be significant to the organization's financial statements or the auditor's report. Consultation With Other Accountants Sometimes, management of the government organization may consult with other accountants about accounting and auditing matters. If the auditor is aware that such consultation has occurred, the auditor should discuss with the audit committee their views about the significant matters that were the subject of the consultation. The audit committee may wish to ask management whether they have consulted with other accountants about accounting and auditing matters. Major Issues Discussed With Management Before Retention The auditor should discuss with the audit committee any major issues that were discussed with management in connection with the initial or recurring retention of the auditor. This includes any discussions regarding the application of accounting principles or auditing standards. For some government organizations, an audit organization is mandated by federal or state law to perform the government organization's audit. While auditor retention is not an issue, the auditor should nonetheless discuss with the audit committee any major issues regarding the auditor's application of accounting principles or auditing standards. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 9 Discussions to Expect Fr om the Independent Auditors 5 Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit The auditor should inform the audit committee about any serious difficulties encountered in working with management during the audit. Examples include, but are not limited to: 1. Unreasonable delays by management in allowing the commencement of the audit 2. Unreasonable delays or refusals by management in providing needed information to the auditor 3. Unreasonable timetable set by management for the conduct of the audit 4. Unavailability of client personnel 5. Failure of client personnel to complete client-prepared schedules on a timely basis Illegal Acts The auditor has the responsibility to assure himself or herself that the audit committee is adequately informed about illegal acts that come to the auditor's attention (this communication need not include matters that are clearly inconsequential). The communication should describe (1) the act, (2) the circumstances of its occurrence, and (3) the effect on the financial statements. What is an illegal act for purposes of this communication? Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS) No. 54, Illegal Acts by Clients (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1, AU sec. 317), defines it as violations of laws or government regulations attributable to the government organization, or acts by management or employees on behalf of the organization. Illegal acts do not include personal misconduct by the organization's personnel unrelated to the government's business activities. In addition, Government Auditing Standards , Auditor Communication, Chapter 5, Section 5.12, issued by the Comptroller General, and OMB Bulletin No. 01-02, Audit Requirements for Federal Financial Statements , Section 7, paragraph c.(3)(a) requires auditors to report noncompliance with laws and regulations disclosed by the audit, except for those instances of noncompliance that are clearly inconsequential. In meeting this requirement, the auditor shall report all instances of fraud and illegal acts unless clearly inconsequential and significant violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements and abuse. In some circumstances, auditors are required to report fraud, illegal acts, violations of provisions of contracts or grant agreements, and abuse directly to parties external to the audited organization. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 10AICPA Audit Committee Toolkit: Government 6 Internal Control Matters See also the tool, \"Internal Control: A Tool for the Audit Committee,\" elsewhere in this toolkit. SAS No. 60, Communication of Internal Control Related Matters Noted in an Audit (AICPA, Professional Standards, vol. 1, AU sec. 325), requires the auditor to communicate matters relating to the organization's internal control that are observed by the auditor in the conduct of a financial statement audit. These matters should be discussed with the audit committee because they represent significant deficiencies in the design or operation of the internal control system, which could adversely affect the organization's ability to initiate, record, process, and report financial data consistent with the assertions of management in the financial statements. Fraud See also the tool, \"Fraud and the Responsibilities of the Audit Committee,\" elsewhere in this toolkit. SAS No. 99, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit (AICPA, Professional Standards , vol. 1, AU sec. 316), requires that the independent auditor bring any evidence of fraud to the attention of the appropriate level of management (generally seen as one level higher than the level at which a suspected fraud may have occurred), even in the case of an inconsequential fraud, such as a minor defalcation by a low-level employee. The independent auditor should reach an understanding with the audit committee regarding when (nature and scope) an inconsequential fraud conducted by a low-level employee should be brought to the audit committee's attention. Fraud involving senior management, and any fraud (whether caused by senior management or other employees) that causes a material misstatement of the financial statements must be reported to the audit committee by the independent auditor.

The financial statements of the Foundation and University of Idaho Health Ben efits Trust were audited by other auditors whose reports thereon have been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Fou ndation and the University of I daho Health Benefits Trust, are based solely on the reports of ot her auditors. In addition, th is required information does not include the other auditors' audit results or other matters that are rep orted on separately by other auditors. Professional standards require th at we provide you with the fol lowing information related to our audit. OUR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS, ISSUED BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES; THE SINGLE AUDIT ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1996; AND THE AUDIT PROVISIONS OF THE OMB UNIFORM GUIDANCE As sta ted in a meeting with the Audit Committee on March 1, 201 6, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, was conducting our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAS); the stand ards for financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States; the S ingle Audit Act Amendments of 1996; and the audit provisions of the OMB Uni form Guidance. It included tests of the University's accounting records, a determination of major progr ams in accordance with the OMB Uniform Guidance, and other procedures we considered necessary to enabl e us to express opinions and to render the required reports. The reports on internal control and compliance include a statem ent that the purpose of the report is solely to: describe the scope of testing of internal control ov er financial reporting and compliance and the result of that testing and not to provide an opinion on the effectiveness of the University's internal control over financial reporting or on compliance; describe the scope of testing internal control over compliance for major federal prog rams and major federal program compliance and the result of that testing and to provide an opinion on compliance but not to prov ide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over compliance; that the report is an integra l part of an audit performed in accordance with Government Auditing Standards in considering the entity's int ernal control over financial re porting and compliance and the OMB Unifo rm Guidance in considering inte rnal control over compliance and major federal program compliance ; and, accordingly, it is not suitable for any other purpose. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 16 2 We are also responsible for communicating significant matters r elated to the financial statement audit that, in our professional judgment, are relevant to your responsibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we are not required to de sign procedures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Uni versity's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we performed tests on its compli ance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant s, noncompliance with which co uld have a direct and material effect on the determination of financia l statement amounts. However, p roviding an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit. Also, in accordance with OMB Circular A 133, we examined, on a test basis, evidence about the University's compliance with the types of compliance requirements described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A 133 Compliance Supplement applicable to each of its major federal programs for the purpo se of expressing an opinion on the Uni versity's compliance with those requirements. Wh ile our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion, it does not provid e a legal determination on the University's compliance w ith those requirements. We also considered the internal controls over compliance with r equirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program in order to determine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing ou r opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordan ce with OMB Circular A133. PLANNED SCOPE AND TIMING OF THE AUDIT We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timin g previously communicated to you in our meeting on March 1, 2016. QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES Significant Accounting Policies M an a g e m e n t i s r e s p o n s i b l e f o r t h e s e l e c t i o n a n d u s e o f a p p r o p r i ate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the University are desc r i b e d i n N o t e 1 t o t h e f i n a n c i a l statements. There were no changes in the application of existin g policies during 2016 except for the following: as described in Note 3 to the financial statements. The University implemented a new accounting standard required b y the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB): GASB Statement No. 72 - Fair Value Measurement and Application T h i s S t a t e m e n t a d d r e s s e s a c c o u n t i n g a n d f i n a n c i a l r e p o r t i n g i s s ues related to fair value measurements. The definition of fair value is the price that wo uld be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. This Statement provides guidance for determining a fair value measurement for financial reporting purposes. This Statement also provides guidance for applying fair value to certain investments and discl osures related to all fair value measurements. The University added the new disclo sure requirements on fa ir value in Note 3 o f the financia l statements. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 17 3 Management Judgments and Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial stat ements prepared by management and are based on management's knowle dge and experience about past a nd current events and assumptions about future events. Certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financ ial statements and because of t h e p o s s i b i l i t y t h a t f u t u r e e v e n t s a ffe ct ing t hem ma y diffe r s ig nifica nt ly fr om t hos e e xp e cte d. W e e va lua t ed t he ke y fact or s a nd assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining they a re reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates affe cting the financial statements are as follows: Fair value of investments The collectability of student loans receivable an d accounts receivable The useful lives of capital assets The compensated abse nce accrual amount The classification of net positi on by type: net investment in capital assets, restricted for expendable, and unrestricted The actuarially determined liabilities related to pensions and other post employment benefit obligations Financial Statement Disclosures We believe the disclosures in the financial statements are cons istent, clear, and understandable. Certain financial statement disclosures are particularly sensit ive because of their significance to financial statement users . The most sensitive disclosures a ffecting the financial statemen ts were Note 12 related to retirement plans, Note 13 related to postemployment benefits (other than pensions) and retiree benefits t rust, and Note 17 related to th e Foundation. Significant Difficulties Encountered During the Audit We encountered no significant diff iculties in dealing with mana gement in performing and completing our audit. Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and l ikely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and commun icate them to the appropriate level of management. During the 2016 fina ncial close process the Univers ity identified a $9.6million Consolidated Investment Trust di stribution from the University' s F o u n d a t i o n w a s i n c o r r e c t l y recorded as unrestricted net position, rather than restricted f or expendable net position as of June 30, 2015. In the 2016 financial statements, the University reclassified prior year net position to correct this immaterial error. T his reclassification had no ef fect on the previously reported change in net position. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 18 4 There were no other known or likel y misstatements identified du ring the audit, other than those considered trivial. Disagreements with Management For purposes of this letter, pro fessional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting , or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the financial statements or the auditor 's report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose dur ing the course of our audit. Management Representations We have requested certain writte n representations from manageme nt that are included in the management representation le tter dated September 30, 2016. Management Consultation with Other Independent Accountants In some cases, management may de cide to consult with other acco untants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a \"second opinion\" on certain situations. If a consultation i n v o l v e s a p p l i c a t i o n o f a n a c c o u n t i n g p r i n c i p l e t o t h e U n i v e r s i ty's financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor's opinion that may be expr essed on those statements, our professional standards require th e consulting accountant to che ck with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants. Other Significant Audit Findings or Issues We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the applic ation of accounting principles and auditing standards, with managem ent each year prior to retentio n as the University's auditors. However, these discussions occurr ed in the normal course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention. OTHER MATTERS With respect to the su pplementary information accompanying the financial statements, we made certain inquiries of management and evaluated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine the info rmation complies with U.S. GAA P, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and complete in relation to our audit of the financial state ments. We compared and reconciled the supplementary information to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financ ial statements or to the financial statements themselves. Our responsibility for other information in the management's discussion and analysis on pages 4 through 16 and the schedules of U niversity's proportionate shar e of net pension liability - PERSI base plan, University contributi ons - PERSI base plan, and fund ing progress - Retiree Benefits Trust on page 74, which is labeled as \"required supplementary information,\" includes applying certain limited procedures to the required supplementary information in accordance with auditing ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 19 5 standards generally accepted in the United States of America. These limited procedures consisted of inquiries of management about th e methods of preparing the info rmation and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We d o n o t e x p r e s s a n o p i n i o n o r p r o v i d e a n y a s s u r a n c e o n t h e i n f o r m a t i o n b e c a u s e t h e l i m i t e d procedures do not provide us with sufficient evidence to expres s a n o p i n i o n o r p r o v i d e a n y assurance. This information is intended solely for the use of Idaho State Board of Education Audit Committee and management of the University and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

The College is required to reconcile these files to their financial records on a monthly basis. Condition: Monthly reconciliations were not performed on a consistent basi s. Evidence of review and approval of reconciliations is not retained by the College and a documented policy and procedure does not currently exist. Questioned costs: None noted. Context: During our testwork over the bo rrower transmission and reconci liation (direct loan) compliance requirements, we noted the College did not retain documentation to support the required reconciliation over direct loan activity for the year. We were unable to assess whether the reconciliations were performed as there was no support ing documentation. Effect: The lack of reconciliations could cause potential loan data issues to go undetected. Cause: Program employees were unaware of all the compliance requiremen ts. Also, there were no written policies or procedures for employee guidance. Recommendation: We recommend the College implement controls to ensure reconcili ations are performed monthly, tracked, and reviewed by the appropriate personnel. I n addition, develop written policies or procedures. Views of responsible officials and planned corrective actions: A combined reconciliation report will be prepared monthly with input from the Director of Financial Aid, Manager of Financial Accounts and the Cash Manager. The Controller will review and maintain the reconcili ations. Policies and procedures will be developed to support the process.

(collectively, the \"College\") as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016, and have issued our report thereo n dated October 7, 2016. Professional standards require that we provide you with the following information related to our audit. Our Responsibility Under Auditing Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards , Issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of America As stated in a meeting with the Audit Committee on March 1, 201 6, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to fo r m a nd e xp r es s a n op inion a bout whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented , in all material respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your responsibilities. Our responsibility is to plan an d perform the audit in accordan ce with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards appl icable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of Ameri ca, and to design the audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit of fin ancial statements includes consideration of internal control over financia l reporting as a basis for des igning audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the College's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingl y, we considered the College's internal control solely for the purposes of determining our audit procedures and not to provide assurance concerning such i nternal control. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 25 Idaho State Board of Education LewisClark State College October 7, 2016 Page 2 Our Responsibility Under Auditing Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards , Issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of America (continued) We are also responsible for communicating significant matters r elated to the financial statement audit that, in our professional judgm ent, are relevant to your respon sibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we ar e not required to design proce dures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Col lege's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we perfor med tests on its compliance wit h certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial s tatement amounts. However, prov iding an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit. Also, in ac cordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), we examined, on a test basis, evidence abou t the C o l l e g e ' s c o m p l i a n c e w i t h t h e t y p e s o f c o m p l i a n c e r e q u i r e m e n t s described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement applicable to each of its major federal programs for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the College's compl iance with those requirements. While our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion, it does not provide a legal determination on the College's compliance with those requirements. We also considered the internal control over compliance with re quirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program in order to determin e our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance. Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timin g previously communicated to you in our meeting on March 1, 2016, oth er than the financial statemen ts were issued later than expected due to delays in receiving the report draft. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 26 Idaho State Board of Education LewisClark State College October 7, 2016 Page 3 SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS AND ISSUES Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the College are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. There were no changes in the application of existing policies during 2016 except for the implementation of GASB Statement No. 72 - Fair Value Mea surement and Application as de scribed in Note 1 to the financial statements. We noted no transactions entered into by the Colleg e during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. There are no signi ficant transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different period th an when the transaction occurred. Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management's knowledge and experience about past and c urrent events and assumptions about future events. Certain acco unting estimates are particula rly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expecte d. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining they a re reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates affe cting the financial statements were: Allowance for uncollectibl e accounts receivable Useful lives of capital assets Valuation of investments Actuarial determined liability related to pensions and other po stemployment benefit obligations Financial Statement Disclosures The disclosures in the financial statements are consistent, cle ar, and understandable. Certain financial statement disclosures are particularly sensitive because of the ir significance to financial statement users. The most sensitive disclosures a ffecting the financial statemen ts were Disclosure of retirement plans in Note 8 to the financial statements, Disclosure of rela ted party transactions in Note 10 to the financial statements, and Disclosure of component unit in Note 13 to the financial statements. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 27 Idaho State Board of Education LewisClark State College October 7, 2016 Page 4 Significant Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit We encountered no significant di fficulties in dealing with mana gement in performing and completing our audit. Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements Professional standards require us to accumulate all factual and judgmental misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and commun icate them to the appropriate level of management. We detected no corrected or uncorrected misstatemen ts of the financial statements as part of our audit. Disagreements with Management For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting , or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the fina ncial statements or the auditor's report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose duri ng the course of our audit. Management Representations We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter dated October 7, 2016. Management Consultation with Other Independent Accountants In some cases, management may de cide to consult with other acco untants about auditing and a c c o u n t i n g m a t t e r s , s i m i l a r t o o b t a i n i n g a \" s e c o n d o p i n i o n \" i n certain situations. If a consultation involves application of an accounting principle to the College' s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor's opinion that may be expressed on those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine that the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there w ere no such consultations with other accountants. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 28 Idaho State Board of Education LewisClark State College October 7, 2016 Page 5 Other Significant Audit Findings or Issues We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the applic ation of accounting pri nciples and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the College's auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the norm al course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention. OTHER MATTERS With respect to the su pplementary information accompanying the financial statements, we made certain inquiries of management and eval uated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine the information compli es with U.S. GAAP, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and comple te in relation to our audit of the financial statements. We compared and recon ciled the supplementary inform ation to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financ ial statements or to the fina ncial statements themselves.

(Foundation) as of and for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, and have issued our report thereo n dated October 14, 2016. We did not audit the financial statements of Boise State University Founda tion, Inc., a discretely presented component unit. Those financial statements were audited by othe r auditors whose report thereon has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for that component unit, is based solely on the rep ort of other auditors. In addit ion, this required information does not include the other auditors' audi t results or other matters that are reported on separately by other auditors. Professional standards require that we provide you wi th the following information related to our audit. OUR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS, ISSUED BY THE COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERCA As stated in a meeting with the Audit Committee on March 1, 201 6, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to fo r m a nd e xp r es s a n op inion a bout whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented , in all material respects, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Our audit of the financial statements does not relieve you or management of your responsibilities. Our responsibility is to plan an d perform the audit in accordan ce with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards appl icable to financial audits contained in Government Auditing Standards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of Ameri ca, and to design the audit to obtain reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement. An audit of fin ancial statements includes consideration of internal control over financia l reporting as a basis for des igning audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University's internal control ov er financial reporting. Accordi ngly, we considered the University's internal control solel y for the purposes of determining our audi t p r o c e d u r e s a n d n o t t o p r o v i d e assurance concerning su ch internal control. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 34 2 We are also responsible for communicating significant matters r elated to the financial statement audit that, in our professional judgm ent, are relevant to your respon sibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process. However, we ar e not required to design proce dures for the purpose of identifying other matters to communicate to you. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about whether the Uni versity's financial statements are free of material misstatement, we perf ormed tests on its compliance with certain provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants, noncompliance with which could have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial s tatement amounts. However, prov iding an opinion on compliance with those provisions was not an objective of our audit. Also, in ac cordance with Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), we examined, on a test basis, evidence abou t the University's compliance with the types of compliance requiremen ts described in the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Compliance Supplement applicable to each of its major federal programs for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the University's compliance with those requirements. While our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion, it does not provide a legal determination on the University's compliance w ith those requirements. We also considered the internal control over compliance with re quirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program in order to determin e our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance with Uniform Guidance. PLANNED SCOPE AND TIMING OF THE AUDIT We performe d the audit according to the planned scope and timin g previously communicated to you in in our meeting on March 1, 2016. QUALITATIVE ASPECTS OF ACCOUNTING PRACTICES Significant Accounting Policies Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the University are described in Not e 1 to the financial statements. There were no changes in the application of existing policies during 2016 except for the implementation of GASB Statement No. 72 - Fair Value Measurement and Application as described in Note 1 to the financial statements. We noted no transactions entered into by the Company during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. There are no signi ficant transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different period th an when the transaction occurred. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 35 3 Management Judgments and Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management's knowledge and experience about past and c urrent events and assumptions about future events. Certain acco unting estimates are particula rly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expecte d. We evaluated the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates in determining they a re reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole. The most sensitive estimates affe cting the financial statements were: Allowance for uncollectible acco unts receivable at June 30, 2016 Useful lives of capital assets Valuation of investments Actuarial determined liability related to pensions and other po stemployment benefit obligations Financial Statement Disclosures We believe the disclosures in the financial statements are cons istent, clear and understandable. Certain financial statement disclosures a re particularly sensitive beca u s e o f t h e i r s i g n i f i c a n c e t o f i n a n c i a l statement users. The most sensitive disclosures a ffecting the financial statemen ts were Note 8 related to bonds and notes payable, Notes 10 related to retirement plans, Note 11 related to pension plans, Note 12 related to postemployment benefits other than pensions, and Note 14 related to the Boise State University Foundation component unit. Significant Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit The Audit Committee should be in formed of any significant diffi culties encountered in dealing with management related to the performance of the audit. We encountered no significant di fficulties in dealing with mana gement in performing and completing our audit. Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements Profe ssional standards require us to accumulate all known and l ikely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that a r e t r i v i a l , a n d c o m m u n i c a t e t hem to the appropriate level of management. There were no material misstatements detected as a result of our audit procedures which required correction by management, either individually or in th e aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 36 4 Disagreements with Management For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting , or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the fina ncial statements or the auditor's report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose duri ng the course of our audit. Management Representations We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter dated October 14, 2016. Management Consultation with Other Independent Accountants In some cases, management may de cide to consult with other acco untants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a \"second opinion\" on certain situations. If a consultation i n v o l v e s a p p l i c a t i o n o f a n a c c o u n t i n g p r i n c i p l e t o t h e U n i v e r s i ty's financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor's opinion that may be expr essed on those statements, our professional standards require th e consulting accountant to che c k w i t h u s t o d e t e r m i n e t h a t t h e consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants. Other Significant Audit Findings or Issues We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the applic ation of accounting pri nciples and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the University's auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the norm al course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention. OTHER MATTERS With respect to the su pplementary information accompanying the financial statements, we made certain inquiries of management and eval uated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine the information compli es with U.S. GAAP, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and comple te in relation to our audit of the financial statements. We compared and recon ciled the supplementary inform ation to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financ ial statements or to the fina ncial statements themselves. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 37 5 We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the in formation because the limited procedures do not provide us wit h sufficient evid ence to expres s an opinion or provide any assurance.

We did not audit the financial statements of Idaho State University Foundation, Inc., a discre t e l y p r e s e n t e d c o m p o n e n t u n i t , a s described in Note 14. Those financial statements were audited b y other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion , insofar as it relates to the amounts included for that component unit, is based solely on the report of other auditors. In addition, this required information does not include the other auditors' audit results or other matters that are reported on separately by other auditors. Professional standards require th at we provide you with the fol lowing information related to our audit. OUR RESPONSIBILITY UNDER AUDITING STANDARDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of America As stated in our engagement letter dated November 18, 2015, our responsibility, as described by professional standards, is to fo r m a nd e xp r es s a n op inion a bout whether the financial statements prepared by management with your oversight are fairly presented , in all material respects, in conformity with accounting princ iples generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Governmen t Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.

An audit of financial statements in cludes consideration of internal control over financia l reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circ umstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the University's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we considered University's internal control solely for the purposes of determining our audit procedures and not to prov ide assurance co ncerning such internal control. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 43 2 Our Responsibility under Auditing Standards Generally Accepted in the United States of America and Government Auditing Standards, issued by the Comptroller General of the United States of America (continued) We are also responsible for communicating significant matters r elated to the financial statement audit that, in our professional judgm ent, are relevant to your respon sibilities in overseeing the financial reporting process.

While our audit provides a reasonable basis for o ur opinion, it does not provide a legal determination on the U niversity's complian ce with those requirements. We also considered the internal controls over compliance with requirements that could have a direct and material effect on a major federal program in order to dete rmine our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on compliance and to test and report on internal control over compliance in accordance wit h the Uniform Guidance. OTHER INFORMATION IN DOCUMENTS CONTAINING AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Our responsibility for other info rmation in the management's discussion and analysis on pages 4 through 17 and certain information in Note 11, Pension Plan, and Note 12, Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions, labeled as \"required supplementary informa t i o n \" , a n d t h e s c h e d u l e o f expenditures and federal awards, i n c l u d e s a p p l y i n g c e r t a i n l i m i ted procedures to the required supplementary information and o ther supplementary information in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. These limited procedures consisted of inquiries of management about th e methods of preparing the info rmation and comparing the information for consistency with management's responses to our inquiries, the basic financial statements, and other knowledge we obtained during our audit of the basic financial statements. We do not express an opinion or provide any assurance on the in formation because the limited procedures do not provide us wit h sufficient evid ence to expres s an opinion or provide any assurance. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 44 3 PLANNED SCOPE AND TIMING OF THE AUDIT We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timin g previously communicated to you in our meeting on March 1, 2016. SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS AND ISSUES Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the University are described in Not e 1 to the financial statements. No new accounting policies were adopte d and there were no changes in the application of existing policies during 2016. We noted no transactions entered into by the University during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. There are no sig nificant transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different period th an when the transaction occurred. Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management's knowledge and experience about past and c urrent events and assumptions about future events. Certain acco unting estimates are particula rly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expected. The most sensitive estimates affecting the financial statements were the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, the useful lives of capital assets, the valuation of investments, and the actuarially determined liability related to other post employment benefit obligations and pension liability. We evaluated the key factor s and assumptions used to develop management's estimates in determ ining they are reasonable in re lation to the financia l statements taken as a whole. Financial Statement Disclosures We believe the disclosures in the financial statements are cons istent, clear, and understandable. Certain financial statement disclosures a re particularly sensitive beca u s e o f t h e i r s i g n i f i c a n c e t o f i n a n c i a l statement users. We believe the most sensitive disclosures affecting the financial statements were Note 8 related to noncurrent liabilities, Notes 11 and 12 relat ed to retirement plans, and Note 14 related to the component unit. Significant Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit We encountered n o significant di fficulties in dealing with mana gement in performing and completing our audit. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 45 4 Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements Professional standards require us to accumulate all factual and judgmental misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that are trivial, and commun icate them to the appropriate level of management. There were no material misstatements detected as a result of our audit procedures which required correction by management, either individually or in th e aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole. The information below summarizes an uncorrected misstatement of t h e f i n a n c i a l s t a t e m e n t s . Management has determined the e ffect is immaterial, both indivi dually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements as a whole. The adjustment is an entry to fully depreciate an asset that was not previously being depreciated. I n 2013, management elected to de preciate an asset over four years rather than all in the prior year. To correct this in the curr ent year statements, net assets would decrease by $536,359, and depreciation expense would decrease b y $536,359. Disagreements with Management For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting , or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the fina ncial statements or the auditor's report. We are pleased to report that no such disagreements arose duri ng the course of our audit. Management Representations We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter da ted September 29, 2016. Management Consultation with Other Independent Accountants In some cases, management may de cide to consult with other acco untants about auditing and accounting matters, similar to obtaining a \"second opinion\" on certain situations. If a consultation i n v o l v e s a p p l i c a t i o n o f a n a c c o u n t i n g p r i n c i p l e t o t h e U n i v e r s i ty's financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor's opinion that may be expr essed on those statements, our professional standards require th e consulting accountant to che c k w i t h u s t o d e t e r m i n e t h a t t h e consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no such consultations with other accountants. Other Significant Audit Findings or Issues We generally discuss a variety of matters, includ ing the applic ation of accounting pri nciples and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the University's auditors.

Planned Scope and Timing of the Audit We performed the audit according to the planned scope and timin g previously communicated to you in our meeting on March 1, 2016. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 52 To the Audit Committee Idaho State Board of Education Page 3 SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS Qualitative Aspects of Accounting Practices Management is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies. The significant accounting policies used by the College are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. There were no changes in the application of existing policies during 2016. We noted no transactions entered into by the College during the year for which there is a lack of authoritative guidance or consensus. We did not identify any material transaction s that have been recognized in the financial statements in a different period than when the transaction occurred. Significant Accounting Estimates Accounting estimates are an integral part of the financial statements prepared by management and are based on management's knowledge and experience about past and c urrent events and assumptions about future events. Certain acco unting estimates are particula rly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ significantly from those expected. The most sensitive estimates affe cting the financial statements were the actuarial determination of the liability related to other postem ployment benefit obligations, pensions, the amount of the compensated absence accrual, the approximation of allowance for doubtful ac counts, and the useful lives of capital assets. Financial Statement Disclosures We believe the disclosures in the financial statements are cons istent, clear, and understandable. Certain financial statement disclosures a re particularly sensitive beca u s e o f t h e i r s i g n i f i c a n c e t o f i n a n c i a l statement users. The most sensiti ve disclosure affecting the fi nancial statements were Note 7 pension plans (and the related Note 8 fo r the restatement due to GASB 6 8), Note 9 postemployment benefits other than pensions and Note 14 related parties. Significant Difficulties Encountered in Performing the Audit We encountered no significant di fficulties in dealing with mana gement in performing and completing our audit. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 53 To the Audit Committee Idaho State Board of Education Page 4 SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS (continued) Corrected and Uncorrected Misstatements Professional standards require us to accumulate all known and l ikely misstatements identified during the audit, other than those that a r e t r i v i a l , a n d c o m m u n i c a t e t hem to the appropriate level of management. We noted $246,000 of certificates of deposit was c lassified as cash and cash equivalents, this misstatement is considered immaterial, individually and in t h e a g g r e g a t e , t o t h e f i n a n c i a l statements taken as a whole. Disagreements with Management For purposes of this letter, professional standards define a disagreement with management as a financial accounting, reporting , or auditing matter, whether or not resolved to our satisfaction, that could be significant to the fina ncial statements or the auditor 's report. We are pleased to report no such disagreements arose during the course of our audit. Management Representations We have requested certain representations from management that are included in the management representation letter dated October 6, 2016. Management Consultation with Other Independent Accountants In some cases, management may de cide to consult with other acco untants about auditing and a c c o u n t i n g m a t t e r s , s i m i l a r t o o b t a i n i n g a \" s e c o n d o p i n i o n \" i n certain situations. If a consultation involves application of an accounting principle to the College' s financial statements or a determination of the type of auditor's opinion that may be expressed in those statements, our professional standards require the consulting accountant to check with us to determine the consultant has all the relevant facts. To our knowledge, there were no s uch consultations with other a ccountants. ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 54 To the Audit Committee Idaho State Board of Education Page 5 SIGNIFICANT AUDIT FINDINGS (continued) Communications with Management We generally discuss a variety of matters, including the applic ation of accounting pri nciples and auditing standards, with management each year prior to retention as the College's auditors. However, these discussions occurred in the norm al course of our professional relationship and our responses were not a condition to our retention. Other Matters With respect to the su pplementary information accompanying the financial statements, we made certain inquiries of management and eval uated the form, content, and methods of preparing the information to determine the information compli es with U.S. GAAP, the method of preparing it has not changed from the prior period, and the information is appropriate and comple te in relation to our audit of the financial statements. We compared and recon ciled the supplementary inform ation to the underlying accounting records used to prepare the financ ial statements or to the fina ncial statements themselves. This information is intended sol ely for the use of Idaho State Board of Education Audit Committee and management of Eastern Idaho Technical College and is not intended to be, and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.

Questions & Comments? Certified Public Accountants and Business Consultants ATTACHMENT 1 AUDIT COMMITTEE Tab 1 Page 56AUDIT COMMITTEE DECEMBER 15, 2016 AUDIT COMMITTEE TAB 2 Page 1 SUBJECT FY 2016 College and Universities' Financial Ratios BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The ratios presented measure the financial health of the institution and include a \"Composite Financial Index\" comprised of four ratios. The ratios are designed as a management tool to measur e financial activity and trends within an institution. They do not lend themselves to comparat ive analysis between institutions because of the varying missions and current initiative s taking place at a given institution. Institution foundations ar e reported as component units in the college and universities' financial statements. T he nationally developed ratio benchmarks model is built around this combined picture. 1 An institution f oundation holds assets for the purpose of supporting the institution. Foundation assets are nearly all restricted for institution purposes and ar e an important part of an institution's financial strategy and financial health. Ratio Measure Benchmark Primary reserve Sufficiency of resources and their flexibility; good measure for net assets .40 Viability Capacity to repay total debt through reserves 1.25 Return on net assets Whether the institution is better off financially this year than last 6.00% Net operating revenues Whether institution is living within available resources 2.00% Composite Financial Index Combines four ratios using weighting 3.0 IMPACT The ratios and analyses are provided in orde r for the Board to review the financial health and relative efficiency of each institution.

The net position is broken down as follows: Invested in capital assets, net of related debt: This represents an institution's total investment in capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation and outstanding debt obligations related to those capital assets. To the extent debt has been incurred but not yet expended for capital assets, such amounts are not included. Restricted, expendable: This represents resources which an institution is legally or contractually obligated to spend in accordance with restrictions imposed by external third parties. Restricted, nonexpendable: This represents endowment and similar type funds in which donors or other outside sources have stipulated, as a condition of the gift instrument, that the principal is to be maintained inviolate and in perpetuity, and invested for the purpose of producing present and future income, which may either be expended or added to principal. Unrestricted: This represents resources derived from student tuition and fees, and sales and services of educational departments and auxiliary enterprises. These resources also include auxiliary enterprises, which are substantially self- supporting activities that provide services for students, faculty and staff. Not all sources of revenue noted above are necessarily present in the unrestricted position. Within the category of Unrestricted Position , the institutions reserve funds for the following: Obligated: Contractual obligations represent a variety of agreements which support initiatives or operations that have moved beyond management planning into execution. Obligations include contracts for goods and services, including construction projects. Obligations contain debt service commitments for outstanding debt and staffing commitments for personnel. These amounts also consist of inventories and other balances for which contractual commitments exist. Designated: Designated net position represents balances not yet legally contracte d but have been dedicated to initiatives that have been deemed to be strategic or mission critical. Balances include capital or maintenance projects that are in active planning phases. Facility and administrative cost recovery returns AUDIT COMMITTEE TAB 3 Page 1AUDIT COMMITTEE DECEMBER 15 , 2016 from sponsored projects (grants and contracts) are reinvested in infrastructure or on efforts to obtain additional grant funding. Documented central commitments to initiatives that have been approved at an executive level are designated. Note: Designated reserves are not yet legally contracted, so technically they are still subject to management decision or reprioritization. However, it's critical to understand that these net position balances are a snapshot in time as of June 30, 2016, so reserves shown as \"designated\" on this report could be \"obligated\" at any point in the current fiscal year. Unrestricted Funds Available: Balance represents reserves available to bridge uneven cash flows as well as future potential funding shortfalls such as: Budget reductions or holdbacks Enrollment fluctuations Unfunded enrollment workload adjustment (EWA) Unfunded occupancy costs Critical infrastructure failures IMPACT The volatility of state funding as well as fluctuations in enrollment and tuition revenue necessitates that institutions maintain fund balances sufficient to stabilize their operating budgets. As such, the Board has set a minimum target reserve of 5% of operating expenditures as a benchmark in its Strategic Plan (Goal 3, Objective D ). The institutions' unrestricted funds available as a percent of operating expenses are as follows: FY 2012 FY Position Balances Page 3 ISU Net Position Balances Page 5 UI Net Position Balances Page 7 LCSC Net Position Balances Page 9 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The institutions will present a brief analysis of their respective unrestricted net position.

Such policies and procedures require approval by the Board, and should be, in so much as practical, parallel to the provisions provided for state of Idaho classified employees in Chapter 53, Title 67, Idaho Code \" (Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies and Procedures, Section II.D.1(b)) . Regarding compensation of classified employees at UI, Regents policy states further that \"compensation for UI classified employees shall be in accordance with the policies of the UI and these policies\" (Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies and Procedures, Section II. E.2). Pursuant to Board Policy II.D., UI classified employee compensation should parallel, to the extent practicable, the relevant sections of Idaho state code, and th at moreover, Regents' approval is necessary when substantial changes to our policies and procedures are proposed. Consistent with this policy, in late 2012, the UI embarked on a study to update job descriptions and develop an updated personnel system for both its classified and non-classified staff, and gather market analysis data to compare UI to the labor market and examine compensation rates. The UI engaged Sibson Consulting to help develop an employee categorization system that would meet the needs of the UI and work well with the breadth of positions within these two employee groups (classified and non-classified). The drafted process and outcomes differed slightly from the Hay Point Factor classification system used by the state's Division of Human Resources for classified positions, but still closely paralleled Idaho State Code. The UI, with the help of Sibson Consulting, identified benchmarked jobs. Sibson matched these benchmarked jobs to comparable positions in the labor market. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 1 Page 2 This matching, along with median salary data, guided Sibson to assign benchmarked jobs to specific pay grades. It was also this median salary data that informed their recommendation to the UI for the number of pay grades, the median salary in those grades, and the spread between the median salaries in each grade. The final step was to review approximately 1500 position description questionnaires that had been submitted by classified staff employees and their supervisors. UI Human Resources staff compared jobs using several common job value factors. HR staff then applied the job value factors to the non- benchmarked jobs and matched those jobs to the benchmarked positions. However, in the years since this new system was implemented, staff turnover rates have risen to over 18%, causing the university to question t he accuracy of both the benchmarking process and the median salary data points. Accordingly, and building on the work completed in 2012, the UI now proposes to take the next evolutionary step in its compensation systems and policies. The proposal would expand the current 11 pay grades, and identify a market-average salary point for every unique job (not position) at the university. The proposed approach would include classified staff, non-classified staff, and faculty members. All employees performing the same work (for example, all custodians) would share the same market rate. So, while UI has approximately 1500 staff employees, the plan is to establish approximately 700-800 market rates. By matching individual jobs more precisely with the associated market-average salary points, UI hopes to position the university to be more competitive at recruiting and retaining highly qualified faculty and staff. This goal is one of the primary themes of the new university strategic plan. UI believes that a credible compensation system should rely on market rate data in providing a basis for determining salaries. Market rates represent the average salary rates paid for the various jobs that exist in the labor market. Other market data also provides information regarding pay ranges around the average. Marke t data is gathered annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Integrated Post-Secondary Education Data System (IPEDS), as well as private entities such as the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources (CUPA-HR). The UI proposes to move forward from its current compensation system (eleven broad classifications) to a market-based system which provides a specific market rate for each individual position. As mentioned, some positions will use the same market rate. But with this approach, the university can be as precise as possible in offering competitive salaries when hiring, and achieving and maintaining equitable salaries for current employees. The broad classifications will be dropped as the university moves forward. Using BLS data, market rates will be collected from the following states: Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado. Data BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION I TAB 1 Page 3 from CUPA-HR will also be used, as it provides information directly related to higher education positions. The primary use of the CUPA-HR data will be from institutions designated as \"high research\" (R2) by the Carnegie classification system in the western United States. Furthermore, the UI will be developing a systematic approach, working within the ranges provided by market data, to address pay equity. This system will include such individual characteristics as previous work experience, total time in service (at UI), time in current position (at UI), and education. Such an approach will serve to address pay compression and avoid any gender pay inequities that might exist or develop otherwise. Minimum pay rates would be set at 80% of the average market salary. UI believes such a system directly responds to the Regent policy expectation that the compensation policies of the UI will, in so much as practical, parallel the provisions provided for State of Idaho classified employees. The state's Division of Human Resources uses market data compiled from the same 8-state region as the UI proposes to use - Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, and Colorado. The state funds new positions at 80% of market average salaries, while the UI's newly-proposed compensation system would set minimum salaries at 80% of market average salaries. Finally, this approach abandons the concept of pay bands, which aligns more closely with the methodologies of the state payroll system. UI administrators have been working with faculty and staff compensation task forces to explore compensation concepts, ideas, principles, philosophies, and proposals. UI recently completed a series of 14 open forum meetings with employees and supervisors. Employees located at remote sites were able to participate in the meetings using an electronic interface. In total, the UI has communicated directly with almost 800 of the university's 1500 staff employees and supervisory. This new compensation proposal has broad support from staff, faculty, and administrators. If approved, the changes would be implemented during the upcoming Change in Employee Compensation (CEC) cycle (Spring 2017). IMPACT A market-rate based compensation system does not, in and of itself, impose any additional cost on the institution. Rather, such a system is designed to direct the allocation of existing and new compensation resources to the areas of greatest need (as determined by the gap between target market salaries and actual employee salaries). The market-rate based compensation system will highlight the disparity between actual salaries and market salaries, which will increase pressure to direct - and redirect - resources to staff compensation. However, no new resources are required to implement this new system.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education (Board) Governing Policies & Procedures, Section I.E.h. and I.F. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Progress has been made on a number of the findings and recommendations of the Medical Education Study Committee's 2009 report. For example, in the 2016 Legislative session, a multiyear effort to increase the number of Idaho-sponsored medical school seats in the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) collaborative effort with the University of Washington (UW) and the University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSOM) resulted in five additional seats in WWAMI (for a total of 40 slots per year and 160 for the 4-year pipeline) and two additional seats for UUSOM (for a total of 10 seats per year and 40 total). Programs have been realigned to enable undergraduate medical students to accomplish a greater portion of their training in Idaho. Funding support for Graduate Medical Education (GME) residency programs has been provided. A private medical school\u2014the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine (ICOM)\u2014is being established in the Treasure Valley, and an affiliation agreement between ICOM and Idaho State University (ISU) has been approved. A number of incentives are in place to encourage medical students and physicians to establish their practices in under-served rural areas in Idaho. Notwithstanding the progress that has been made, much work remains to be done to address current and future medical/health needs of Idaho citizens. In the Governor's State of the State address in January 2016, Governor Otter asked the Board of Education \" to work with our medical community and higher education BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 2 institutions to develop a new plan for addressing future demand for healthcare providers .\" Subsequently, in April 2016, the Board re-convened its Medical Education Study Committee to begin the planning task requested by the Governor. Committee members have been drawn from the Board, each of the four-year higher education institutions, and subject matter experts from the private sector, public health agencies, and other key stakeholders, including the Idaho Medical Association (IMA) and the Idaho Hospital Association (IHA). The Committee has received inputs from rural health care providers, physicians, physician assistants, practical nurses, current students and graduates from medical programs, and external agencies and consultants. Teams within the Committee have worked with the Governor's Budget Office and Department of Health and Welfare to explore near-term opportunities to enhance access to health care in Idaho. Primary Findings/Areas of Concern: The Committee has identified three primary areas which need prompt and sustained action to improve access to medical and health services for Idahoans. 1. Improving/expanding the pipeline for physicians and other healthcare providers. 2. Addressing the maldistribution of healthcare providers and services throughout Idaho (i.e., the lack of access to services in rural areas) 3. Increasing access to behavioral health services in rural areas (an issue which compounds the problem of attracting and retaining other healthcare providers in rural areas). In addressing the above-listed trio of concerns, the Committee has developed findings and recommendations which impact the health education pipeline at four levels: pre-medical education (K-12 and postsecondary education); Undergraduate Medical Education (medical school, training programs for physician assistants, practical nurses, medical technicians, etc.); Graduate Medical Education (GME) residency programs; and post-training/actual practice support. In all, twenty-eight action recommendations have been identified which cover all three of the main areas of concern and all four segments of the medical/health education pipeline. A brief outline of the action items is provided in Attachment 1. As a prelude to fleshing out these recommendations and developing detailed action plans, the Committee is asking the Board to review and approve the items for submission to the Governor's Office, and to set the stage for further detailed planning and implementation. IMPACT Upon Board, Governor, and Legislative approval, action on the Committee's various recommendations will have a positive impact on the training, support, and retention of health care professionals and on the provision of needed medical and health services to Idahoans in rural and urban areas. Actions that improve the training, support and retention of health care professionals will, in turn, improve BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 3 Idaho's ability to attract, support, and retain healthy, productive citizens and economic growth for the State.

Appointed to the new Medical Education Committee were subject matter experts, medical leaders, and key stakeholders from across the state. [A list of Committee members is provided in the appendices to this report.] The Committee's mandate was to develop recommended action areas to address Idaho's pressing healthcare needs. The committee deliberated and ultimately defined its charge as ass essing issues affecting Idaho citizens' access to medical care. The Committee deliberately focused on issues affecting access to primary healthcare providers \u2014physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants \u2014and those factors which affect their training, recruitment, and retention. It is understood that other important healthcare issues also play a role in access (especially rural access) to medical care, and some of these issues are being (or will be) worked elsewhere, for example, Idaho students' access to medical school and the relative supply of other healthcare professionals in the State (including, but not limited to: physical therapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists, clinical laboratory scientists, nutritionists, social workers, psychologists, counselors, health care administrators, and others). The context for the committee's work included an assessment of the implementation of the recommendations from the 2009 Medical Education Taskforce report, as well as changes in the environment since the 2009 report. In offerin g its recommendations, the Committee focused on the supply, recruitment, and retention of health professionals. While the supply dimension is driven to a large extent by national and state medical education opportunities, the recruitment and retention of health professionals is also affected by factors tangential to, or even outside, the direct influence of education. Factors such as competition with other states in the region, market levels for compensation, work environments, and other factors also have significant influence on access to medical services in Idaho. The Committee's recommendations are intended to guide both short-term and medium-term planning with respect to medical education and primary provider recruitment, retention, and distribution in Idaho. The Committee reviewed the recommendations of the previous medical education taskforce report from 2009, then worked diligently to gather data and work with stakeholders to assess the current state of healthcare access throughout Idaho. The committee met in May 2016 to launch initial studies, and then met monthly since August 2016 to hear from experts and discuss reports submitted on specific topics of interest by informed task force members. Reports were drawn from credible national data sources, including the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM), as well as Idaho-specific survey work done by professional associations and state agencies. The Committee worked with stakeholders and representatives from the University of Washington-led Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) program; the University of Utah School of Medicine ; the Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine (ICOM) medical education program; Physician Assistants and Nurse Practitioner professionals; physicians in training; heads of the major Idaho health systems; and rural hospital and physician representatives with extensive experience in meeting the health challenges of rural Idaho. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 5 At the conclusion of the Committee's deliberations, a sub -committee , led by the Committee's chairman, Ed Dahlberg, drafted potential recommendations which were then reviewed, finalized, and prioritized by the full Committee at its meeting in December 2016. The prioritization of recommended action items was based on the potential impact the proposed actions would have on improving access to medical service to Idahoans in all regions of the State. While the Committee appreciated that there could be a significant financial impact in implementing some of the recommendations, the potential cost of actions was not the primary driver in prioritizing the recommendation s. General Findings The findings \u2014and subsequent recommendations \u2014of the Committee fall into three principal areas: 1. Supply factors. 2. Maldistribution of medical/health professional providers. 3. Lack of mental health providers throughout the state (urban as well as rural areas). This critical shortage compounds the pressure to recruit, support, and retain primary medical/health providers, especially in rural areas. Supply National data confirm that Idaho's citizens are underserved in primary health care (as well as mental health resources) due to a low number of physicia ns per capita, compounded by uneven distribution, particularly in terms of low service coverage in rural areas. A further complication is that Idaho is surrounded by states which are facing their own physician shortages and which are aggressively working to recruit additional physicians, creating additional pressures on Idaho providers, including medical school graduates with high student loan debts who may be lured by higher compensation rates and more robust support infrastructure in nearby states. The circumstances are similar for Physician Assistants (PAs) and Nurse Practitioners (NPs). This is especially true for NPs where the current supply of trained professionals in the State does not meet the replacement rate needed to backfill retirees (34% of incumbents are over age 55) \u2014a shortage which is being exacerbated by an aggressive competitive market in neighboring states. Significant progress has been made since 2009 in expanding one segment of the physician pipeline \u2014namely, medical school training (undergraduate medical education). In 2009, Idaho had only 20 WWAMI medical school slots each year, and only 6 University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSOM) positions per year. For FY2017, there are 40 annual WWAMI slots for entering Idaho-sponsored students, and there are 10 UUSOM slots for Idaho. As a result of recent curriculum revisions, WWAMI students will now remain in Idaho for a greater percentage of their four-year programs. The Idaho College of Osteopathic Medicine (ICOM) plans to receive its first entering class of 150 students (drawn from Idaho and four other neighboring states) in 2018. Washington State University (WSU) has received preliminary accreditation for a new medical school in Spokane, which may also provide additional undergraduate medical education opportunities for Idaho students. The primary effects of these changes are: Increased numbers of MD and DO training opportunities for Idaho students. Increased competition for physician preceptors to support student training. Increased competition for the limited number of currently-available Graduate Medical Education (GME) residency slots. Challenges for Ida ho's primary, secondary, and post -secondary school system pipeline to produce enough qualified students to fill the new ly-available positions. With the increased accession rate to WWAMI and UUSOM over the past few years, there has been a gradual decrease in entrance exam scores to the point that some students are being accepted with scores below the level traditionally considered the standard for prediction of successful completion of medical school. The Committee noted that the quality and BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 6 preparation of college graduates who plan to enter medical school would be improved if Idaho's colleges and universities were to establish and promote pre-med tracks within their undergraduate program offerings. Likewise, expansion in the number and size of other undergraduate health professions training programs should be considered by Idaho post-secondary institutions. (Even) greater demand for the supply and engagement of qualified preceptors for 3rd and 4th year medical student training. With respect to the overall medical education pipeline, the greatest current shortfall\u2014 and the area of greatest potential positive impact \u2014lies in the number and types of residencies (Graduate Medical Education) available in Idaho. Studies consistently show that the highest predictor of a physician's ultimate practice locatio n is the area in which they complete their residency training, particularly for residents in primary care specialties. Recent investments by the state in the expansion of the WWAMI and University of Utah programs, as well as the anticipated development of ICOM, provide sufficient MD/DO training opportunities (Undergraduate Medical Education) for qualified Idaho citizens. However, graduates of these programs, as well as physicians trained outside Id aho, must be provided with access to residency programs in Idaho to be effectively retained. Idaho's allied health professional training has been largely separated from its MD training. This separation does not facilitate integrated healthcare team training. Better coordination, particularly in the patient experience portion of training could enhance these programs. Maldistribution of Professional Providers: 94% of Idaho's counties are classified as primary care Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) under federal criteria. All 44 of Idaho's counties are considered HPSAs for mental health services. Assuring access to health services in rural areas will require multiple approaches. New models of healthcare delivery, such as broader implementation of telemedicine with appropriate reimbursement and integrated healthcare teams \u2014including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, and mental health professionals \u2014will be critical to healthcare delivery in rural areas. Residency and practicum programs that expose students intentionally to rural practice may enhance physician recruitment to rural areas. Loan repayment and other financial incentives, as well as more effective support for practicing physicians, especially with respect to community mental health, may also enhance rural physician recruitment and retention. Another significant issue, related by rural physicians who testified to the Committee, is that potential providers in the training pipeline are dissuaded from practicing in rural areas because of concerns over the perceived/actual isolation of rural practices, lack of communications/support systems with colleagues in major metropolitan areas, low compensation rates (a factor in paying off medical school loans), and lack of robust K-12 education opportunities for their children in some rural communities. Lack of Mental Health Providers: Idaho is very underserved with respect to mental health professionals as well as most other primary care providers, such as Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Pharmacists, Social Workers, and Clinical Psychologists. Lack of support, particularly with regard to mental and behavioral health issues, is a key stress factor for rural physicians and medical service providers, whose workload and resources are pushed to the limit when trying to address mental health issues in addition to their medical responsibilities. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 1 Page 7 Specific Recommendations: Continue to grow the number of accredited residencies. Top priority is primary care residencies (Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Pediatrics). Next priority is specialty residencies (General Surgery, Psychiatry, Psychologists). Leverage state support of expanded residency capacity with Medicaid and external resources. Designate a coordinator to support statewide GME expansion efforts and flesh-out action plans to implement the Medical Education Committee's recommendations. Establish a standing GME Council to help coordinate efforts over the next 10 years. Grow the supply of qualified preceptors to support training of healthcare providers. Consider state tax breaks for preceptors. Explore enhanced Medicaid and commercial coverage rates for preceptors. Sustain programmatic and infrastructure support funding for WWAMI and UUSOM. Improve support to providers in rural areas. Explore/expand locum tenens staff support arrangements for underserved areas. Enhance training in and support of telemedicine capabilities. Support integrated healthcare team operations, including mental health providers. Increase financial incentives and reimbursement to support recruitment and retention of rural healthcare providers. Enhance loan repayment programs/options for rural physicians (establish parity with surrounding states). Expand healthcare provider training opportunities that include rural exposure. Implement and expand specific undergraduate medical sciences curricula (including \"Pre -Med\" programs) and other health career opportunity tracks to feed the pre-medical and pre-health professions pipelines. Establish scholarship programs for Idaho students (admitted to any accredited medical school) who agree to serve for four years in underserved rural areas. Develop programs in K-12 system to encourage and prepare students for future careers in medical/health professions. Encourage recruitment of high-quality International Medical Graduates (IMGs) for underserved areas. Streamline and coordinate J-1 visa procedures and state licensure policies. Explore targeted recruitment programs and incentives.

Section 33-3802, Idaho Code BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University (BSU) requests approval by the Idaho State Board of Educa tion (Board) to issue tax-exempt general revenue and refunding bonds (\"Series 2017A Bonds\") pursuant to a Supplemental Bond Resolution in an amount not to exceed $ 78,570,000. Construction funds $32,000,000 Outstanding 2007 bonds 45,870,000 Estimated issuance costs 700,000 Maximum Bond Issue $78,570,000 In October 2016 the Board authorized BSU to proceed with construction of a new Fine Arts Building for a total cost not to exceed $42 million . Approximately $ 32 million of the proceeds of the Series 2017A Bonds will be used to partially finance the construction of the Fine Arts Building. The remaining $10 million will be funded by Permanent Building Fund Set A funds, donations and BSU reserves . An aggregate principal amount not to exceed approximately $45,870,000 will be used to refund that portion of the outstanding Series 2007A and Series 2007B bonds supported by market conditions at the time of the bond sale. With the assistance of its bond underwriter, BSU periodically reviews outstanding bond issues to assess whether market conditions warrant refinancing to take advantage of lower interest rates . This project is anticipated to bid in late December 2016. Construction will be completed in early spring 2019, with occupancy in August 2019. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 2 Principal Amount Total not to exceed $78,570,000; approximately $32,000,000 in Fine Arts construction funding and $45,870,000 to refinance 2007A and B issuances. Maturities and Amortization Plan To be determined the day of pricing, scheduled for January 12. The maturity structure for the refunding component will be 2018-36 to mimic the Series 2007A Bonds. The Fine Arts construction portion will be amortized on a level debt service basis 2018-47. Source of Security General Revenue pledge of BSU, excluding appropriated funds, direct grant and contract revenues and restricted gifts. Ratings BSU's current ratings are A1/A+ by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, respectively (see 2016A reports at Attachments 3 and 4). Rating agency updates were conducted the week of December 5, 2016, in anticipation of the 2017A issuance. IMPACT Project funding leverages the strategic facility fee by utilizing several additional funding sources including $5 million in Permanent Building Fund (PBF) \"Set A\" funding, cash donations and pledges, and BSU reserves. The projected funding package is as follows: Set A, PBF funds (FY2016 and FY2017): $ 5,000,000 and 5,000,000 2017A general revenue proceeds: 32,000,000 Total $42,000,000 This project will be procured through the Construction Manager at Risk (CMR) process through the Division of Public Works (DPW) and the Idaho Division of Purchasing standard process as appropriate. Series 2007A and Series 200 7B bonds will be refunded to the extent that the net present value savings exceed three (3) percent. In the event that market conditions are no longer favorable at the time of the sale, no refunding bonds will be issued. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 3 BSU's current debt service ratio is 4.81 percent. The projected maximum ratio, after the 2017 A issuance, is 5. 86 percent.

The refunding action is contingent upon a favorable interest rate at the time of sale. The additional debt to be assumed for financing the Fine Arts Building can be absorbed by BSU without exceeding the Board's prescribed maximum debt service ratio (8%, defined as Actual Debt Service divided by Annual Adjusted Expenses in Board Policy V.F.4.c.). Staff recommends approval. A roll call vote is required. BOARD ACTION I move to approve the finding that the Fine Arts Building is economically feasible and necessary for the proper operation of Boise State University and to approve a Supplemental Resolution for the Series 2017A Bonds, the title of which is as follows: A SUPPLEMENTAL RESOLUTION of the Board of Trustees of Boise State University authorizing the issuance of General Revenue Project and Refunding bonds, in one or more series, of Boise State University; delegating authority to approve the terms and provisions of the bonds and the principal amount of the bonds up to $78,570,000; authorizing the execution and delivery of a Bond Purchase Agreement upon sale of the bonds; and providing for other matters relating to the authorization, issuance, sale and payment of the bonds.

Gephardt dennis.gephardt@moodys.com Susan E Shaffer 212-553-4132 VP-Senior Analyst susan.shaffer@moodys.com Boise State University, ID New Issue - Moody's Assigns Aa3 to Boise State University's (ID) Series 2016A; Outlook Stable Summary Rating Rationale Moody's Investors Service assigns a Aa3 rating to Boise State University's proposed issuance of approximately $63 million of fixed-rate General Revenue Refunding Bonds, Series 2016A. The bonds are expected to be issued as serial bonds, with maturities in 2016-39. The assignment of the Aa3 rating reflects rating Boise State University's very good strategic positioning, with healthy, forward-looking programmatic and capital investments, growing online and STEM programs and unique market position as a comprehensive urban public university. The rating also incorporates the university's solid and conservative fiscal management which enables BSU to maintain surplus operations even as it invests in programs and despite some variability in net tuition revenue growth. Credit challenges include slow growth of wealth and weakening cash flow as the university has been spending reserves on strategic investments. Credit Strengths \u00bb Solid student market as an urban public university with over 15,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) students and healthy programmatic investment \u00bb Strong oversight, budgeting and planning contribute to positive operations despite slowed net tuition revenue growth \u00bb Spendable cash and investments provide adequate cushion of debt and operations, at 1.0 and 0.7 times, respectively Credit Challenges \u00bb Softening cash flow as the university spends accumulated reserves for strategic programmatic investments \u00bb Continued capital investment and debt plans will keep leverage modestly high relative to peers \u00bb Plan to grow research enterprise will be challenging in highly competitive research funding environment ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 55MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE This publication does not announce a credit rating action.

The outlook incorporates some tolerance for modest enrollment volatility especially in light of strong budgeting and financial oversight. Factors that Could Lead to an Upgrade \u00bb Substantial increase in the scope of operations, including growth of research enterprise \u00bb Improved wealth and liquidity to support debt and operations Factors that Could Lead to a Downgrade \u00bb Sustained enrollment declines and materially contracting net tuition revenue \u00bb Deterioration of operating performance Key Indicators Exhibit 1 FTE Enrollment reflects fall of the calendar year Source: Moody's Investors Service Recent Developments The university is moving forward with EdR on a public private partnership for an approximately 600 bed residence hall on recently purchased property adjacent to campus. The site would accommodate both the university's honors college and other traditional undergraduate students. Currently, the project is proposed to entail a 50 year ground lease, with a total project cost of $30-40 million which will be funded by the developer. The new housing will represent approximately a quarter of total housing capacity on campus. The project is important to BSU as it seeks to build residential campus life and improve the academic profile of its students. Detailed Rating Considerations Market Profile: Very Good Strategic Positioning with Forward-looking Program Development and Growing STEM Programs Boise State University's strategic positioning is bolstered by its location in the capital of Idaho, with a sizable and diverse economic base that includes technology, higher education, and healthcare sectors. The university is continually enhancing its programs and partnerships to ensure that its academic offerings meet the needs of local industry and foward-looking economic trends. BSU is making concerted efforts to both broaden its market reach and improve its academic profile, with some success. A focus on STEM (science, ATTACHMENT 3 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 56MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE 3 28 March 2016 Boise State University, ID: New Issue - Moody's Assigns Aa3 to Boise State University's (ID) Series 2016A; Outlook Stabletechnology, engineering and mathematics) has contributed to growing out of state enrollment with 38% of freshmen coming from outside of Idaho (including international students) in fall 2015. We expect BSU to easily adapt to declines in Saudi Arabian enrollment due to the reduction of government grants in that country. Saudi Arabian students represented less than 1% of total freshmen enrollment in fall 2015. Growth of BSU's eCampus helps offset volatility in undergraduate resident enrollment that tends to be countercyclical to the economy. Total full time equivalent (FTE) enrollment was down slightly (1.2%) in fall 2015, but tends to range from 15,000 to 16,000 over the long term. The university is conservatively budgeting for declines in fall 2016. The university is building eCampus degrees based on programs for which it already has strong demand and brand recognition, such as nursing and medical imaging. Over the last 10 years the university has been investing in infrastructure to grow its research profile. The recent opening of a biomedical research vivarium is expected to jumpstart funding in this area, with a $10 million grant from the National Institutes of Health announced in FY 2015. Research expenditures are expected to grow modestly, and have remained relatively stable at $20-22 million over the last five years. A recent $25 million donation will help the university construct a new building to expand its research and graduate programs in material science, which will increase prospects for funding for that discipline. Operating Performance: Strong Expense Control and Fiscal Oversight Underpin Surplus Operations BSU's strong budgetary oversight and expense containment give it tremendous operating flexiblity. The ability to methodically and strategically build up reserves for long-term plans through operating cash flow is a key credit strength for the university. Cash flow softened over the last few years due to strategic investment in programs, but is expected to stabilize in FY 2016 and remain healthy at 12% or above, with debt service coverage of around 2.5 times. Surplus operations are achieved through careful expense control in conjunction with moderate overall revenue growth (at about 4.4%). Net tuition revenue, BSU's largest revenue source at over 60%, will continue to grow at or above inflation with modest tuition increases and a continued focus on affordability. Over the last three years, net tuition revenue has grown at an average 3.4%. State appropriations, which represent 26% of revenue, have grown at about 5% a year from FY 2014 to FY 2016. The Governor has proposed another increase to state operating support for FY 2017. Wealth and Liquidity BSU's spendable cash and investments will continue to provide a moderate cushion for debt and operations, as the university balances new capital plans with gifts and planned reserve growth. FY 2015 spendable cash and investments grew for the first time in several years as the university paused on its capital spending; cushioning debt by 1.0 times and operations by 0.7 times, on par with the Aa3 public university medians. Gift revenue is solid, with an average of $32 million over the last three years, and expected to improved with a $25 million gift from the Micron Foundation in FY 2016 to support a new materials science building. The university has also raised approximately $29 million to date for its scholarship campaign, exceeding its $25 million goal. The BSU foundation manages its endowment, valued at $155 million as of June 30, 2015, with a small decline posted through December 31, 2015. The investment allocation is conservative with almost 90% in public equities and fixed income; FYE 2015 return was 1.1%. LIQUIDITY BSU's liquidity is growing, but remains modest for the rating category, with just 127 monthly days cash on hand to support operations. This amount is sufficient to handle BSU's fixed rate debt profile and relatively straight forward operations. Leverage The university's deliberate and measured approach to capital spending offsets its moderately elevated debt levels. With debt to operating revenue of 0.7 times BSU's practice of setting clear fundraising and/or appropriation milestones prior to committing debt to new projects will ensure that leverage remains reasonable. However, future debt affordability at this rating level will depend up on maintenance or growth of current cash flow levels, with debt to cash flow of 5.2 times in FY 2015, up from 4.3 times in FY 2013.

Debt service on the facilities will be offset by implementation of an additional student facilities fee. The remainder of the project costs will be funded through gifts and state appropriations. The state has pledged $5 million in capital funding toward the fine arts building, and the university plans to list the materials science building as a strategic funding priority for FY 2017 capital appropriations. Debt Structure Boise State University's all fixed rate and regularly amortizing debt structure provides predictability in fixed expenses. DEBT-RELATED DERIVATIVES None PENSIONS AND OPEB The university's other debt like obligations are relatively modest compared to peers. The university closed participation in the state's multi-employer defined benefit plan (Public Employee's Retirement System of Idaho, PERSI) for all new faculty and professional staff in 1990 which has greatly reduced its fixed pension costs and liabilities. Classified staff continue to participate in PERSI, and classified staff currently represent approximately 25% of university workforce. Moody's three-year adjusted net pension liability (ANPL) was $66 million for FYs 2013-2015, resulting in moderate additional leverage. Spendable cash and investments cover total adjusted debt (including direct debt, capitalized operating leases and ANPL) by 0.8 times compared to the median of 0.5 times for Aa rated peers. The university also participates in a multiple-employer defined contribution plan for faculty and staff hired after 1990 (the Optional Retirement Program, ORP). Total employer pension contributions for both programs were $13 million in FY 2015, representing a manageable 3.8% of operating revenue. The university participates in multi-employer defined other postemployment benefit (OPEB) plan to which it contributes annually. As of FYE 2015, the university's OPEB liability was a moderate $9.6 million. In 1990 all new faculty and professional staff were required to be part of the ORP, the PERSI system was no longer an option. New hires, which are classified staff are still eligible to enroll in the PERSI system. In total classified staff are about 25% of our workforce. Governance and Management: Conservative Budgeting and Forward-Looking Planning Add Flexibility BSU's conservative budgeting and in-depth short and long-term planning are a credit positives that will contribute to continued positive operations and thoughtful and strategic programmatic reinvestment. The university continues its strategic program, academic and capital reallocation efforts, with a keen eye on expense reduction. The financial management budgets conservatively on enrollment and includes several contingencies that help maintain positive operations. Legal Security The Series 2016A bonds are on parity with BSU's outstanding General Revenue Bonds. BSU's general revenue bonds are secured by the broadest pledge available for the university. Pledged Revenues include student charges, auxiliary revenues, indirect cost recovery, and other specified revenue sources. State appropriations and other externally restricted funds are not included in the Pledged Revenues. Under the Resolution, BSU has a debt service covenant and additional bonds test of at least 1.1 times. There is no debt service reserve fund. For FY 2015, Pledged Revenues of $216 million cover pro-forma maximum annual debt service (including the Series 2016A bonds) almost 12 times. Use of Proceeds Proceeds from the Series 2016A bonds will be used to refund all or a portion of certain maturities of the Series 2007A and 2009A General Revenue Bonds and to pay costs of issuance. Obligor Profile Boise State University is well positioned to maintain a stable market position as the largest comprehensive public university in Idaho (by enrollment) with total headcount of over 22,000 students. The main campus is in Boise, Idaho, with several off campus centers in the surrounding areas that typically serve part-time and non-traditional students.

At the same time, Standard & Poor's affirmed its 'A+' long-term rating and underlying rating (SPUR) on the university's parity debt. The outlook is stable. We assessed the university's enterprise profile as strong, characterized by a stable management team, with respectable student quality characteristics helping to partly offset softening demand over the past three years. We assessed BSU's financial profile as very strong with consistent full-accrual operating surpluses and available resources that are in line with the rating category. We believe these combined credit factors lead to an indicative stand-alone credit profile of 'a+'. In our opinion, the 'A+' rating on the university's bonds reflects BSU's strength of operations, offset by enrollment declines. Pro forma maximum annual debt service (MADS) is above average and we anticipate that BSU will issue as much as $57 million in new debt in the next two years, but we believe that this debt level should remain manageable so long as BSU maintains positive operations and increases its available resources. The rating further reflects our assessment of BSU's: History of reporting positive adjusted financial operations on a full-accrual basis, Good fiscal stewardship with a focus on operations and conservative budgeting, and Adequate available resource ratios for the rating category. Partly offsetting the above strengths, in our view, are BSU's: High pro forma debt burden, Trend of fluctuating enrollment with softening in the most recent year given a decline in college-ready high school students in the region, and Above-average pro forma MADS burden of about 4.8% of 2015 operating expenses. The series 2016A bond proceeds will be used to advance refund the university's 2007A and 2009A bonds. All of BSU's existing bonds, including the series 2016A general refunding bonds, are parity general revenue debt secured by an unlimited student fee pledge of the university. This student fee is internally dedicated to debt service, and there is no debt service reserve fund.

BSU was founded in 1932 and has the largest student enrollment of any post-secondary institution in Idaho with 15,451 full-time equivalent (FTE) students as of fall 2015. The university is fully accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities through 2018, and a number of its academic programs have also obtained specialized accreditation. The majority of students are undergraduates (about 87%) and more than 67% of the student body is from the state. The university has a growing ecampus, which has grown to a headcount of over 27,000 students. Outlook The stable outlook reflects our expectation that over the next two years the university will continue to generate balanced or better operating results on a full-accrual basis, maintain its existing available resources relative to operations and debt, and weather fluctuating and softening enrollment trends. We expect that future debt will coincide with a commensurate increase in available resources and that BSU will maintain a manageable debt burden. Downside scenario Credit factors that could lead to a negative rating action during the outlook period include continued enrollment declines, significant operating deficits, erosion of available resources relative to the rating category, or the issuance of new debt to levels that significantly increase the university's debt burden and cause available resources relative to debt to decline to levels that are less than adequate for the rating. Upside scenario Although upward movement of the rating is unlikely during the outlook period given the university's variable demand and enrollment and above-average debt burden, credit factors that could lead to a positive rating action beyond the outlook period include substantial improvement in the university's available resource ratios relative to the rating category and stabilization of BSU's enrollment profile. Enterprise Profile Industry risk Industry risk addresses our view of the higher education sector's overall cyclicality and competitive risk and growth through application of various stress scenarios and evaluation of barriers to entry, levels and trends of profitability, substitution risk, and growth trends observed in the industry. We believe the higher education sector represents a low credit risk when compared with other industries and sectors. Economic fundamentals In our view, BSU has limited geographic diversity, with more than 67% of students coming from Idaho. As such, our assessment of BSU's economic fundamentals is anchored by the state GOP per capita. Market position and demand BSU has been challenged with softening demand within its undergraduate program and FTE enrollment. In fall 2015 its undergraduate FTE enrollment fell by 2.6% to 13,928 students and its total FTE enrollment declined by 1.2% to 14,541. Management attributes the decreases to local changes, including fewer regional college-ready high school WWW .STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT MARCH 24,2016 3 1603781 1 302443362 ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 65Boise State University, Idaho; Public Coll!Univ- Unlimited Student Fees graduates and price sensitivity associated with the rising costs of education. Management reports that enrollment should begin to stabilize and has noted that applications for fall 2016 have increased, but has conservatively budgeted for FTE enrollment declines in fiscal 20 16. On the upside, graduate enrollment continues to grow and increased by a healthy 2.4% for fall2015. In our view, the enrollment and demand profile is adequate but somewhat variable. Excluding fall2015, BSU has experienced volatility in its freshman undergraduate applications with applications increasing by as much as 11% (fall 2014) and decreasing by as much as 21% (fall2013). The university's freshman selectivity rate weakened to 80% in fall 2015 from 54% in fall 2012. Its freshman matriculation rate portrayed a similar trend, weakening to 34% from 53% in the same period. However, in fall 20 15 student quality as measured by the average entering freshman's ACT score increased slightly to 23.3 as did its retention rate, which improved to a healthy 76%. Its six-year graduation rate remains weak at 38%. BSU provides 1,860 beds on campus in residence halls, 201 leased apartments, and 360 townhomes. Management reports that occupancy rates as of fall 20 15 were at 91% for residence halls, 98% for the apartments, and 98% for the townhomes, which we consider strong. BSU fundraising is done through the BSU Foundation. Management reports that gifts increased to $31.3 million from $10.1 million during the first six months of fiscal 2016 as a result of a $25 million gift for a new on-campus science building. BSU is also in the middle of a $25 million scholarship campaign with $29 million raised through March 2016. The campaign is scheduled to complete in June 2017 and management reports that it will continue to fundraise for this campaign. In our view, fundraising has improved and remains moderate. We expect fundraising to continue at historical levels. Management and governance BSU's board and management team are in line with the rating. Dr. Bob Kustra has been president of BSU since 2003, prior to which he served two terms as lieutenant governor in Illinois and 1 0 years in the Illinois state legislature. The rest of the senior management team has remained relatively unchanged, which we believe lends stability to the overall credit profile. The responsibility for overall management and determination of university policies and standards is vested with the BSU board, which also serves as the Idaho State Board of Education, the Regents of the University of Idaho, the Board of Trustees for Idaho State University in Pocatello, the Board of Trustees for Lewis Clark State College in Lewiston, and the State Board for Professional- Technical Education and Vocational Rehabilitation. The governor appoints seven of the members of the combined boards for five-year terms. The elected state superintendent of public instruction serves ex officio as the eighth member of the board for a four-year term. The university operates under a formal campus master plan and strategic plan. The most recent strategic plan, \"Focus on Effectiveness,\" covers 2012 through 2017. This plan includes key performance indicators with goals that we believe are consistent and appropriate with the needs of the organization. We take a positive view of management's standards for operational performance and effectiveness. Management completed the state-mandated program prioritization to reduce costs and the corresponding strategic realignment in the past fiscal year. These efforts garnered efficiencies of more than $2.6 million in fiscal2015. This is a continuous process and a tool for management to reallocate resources and produce savings, enabling management to identify efficiencies and improve its overall cost structure.

Financial Profile Financial management policies We consider BSU's financial management policies as robust. The university has formal policies for its endowment, investments, and debt. It operates according to a five-year strategic plan and has a formal policy for maintaining reserves. The financial policies assessment reflects our opinion that, despite some areas of risk, the organization's overall financial policies are not likely to hamper its ability to pay debt service. Our analysis of financial policies includes a review of the organization's financial reporting and disclosure, investment allocation and liquidity, debt profile, contingent liabilities, and legal structure and a comparison of these policies with those of comparable providers. In line with our report \"Assessing The Impact Of GASB 68 On U.S. Public Universities And Charter Schools,\" published Dec. 15, 2015 on RatingsDirect, we have made certain adjustments to the financial statements of public colleges and universities and certain public charter schools for financial results beginning with fiscal year end June 30, 2015 to enhance analytical clarity regarding the economic substance of the funding of liabilities, expenses, and deferred inflows and outflows of resources associated with pension plan obligations and a change in accounting principle as detailed in GASB Statement No. 68, \"Accounting and Financial Reporting for Pensions-an amendment of GASB Statement No. 27.\" We believe these adjustments enhance analytical clarity from a credit perspective and result in more comparable financial metrics as long as states are able and willing to fund these pension liabilities. It is our understanding that the responsibility for BSU's pension liabilities will remain with the state. Financial operations Being the state's largest public institution of higher education, BSU receives one of the largest portions of state appropriation funding allocated to public institutions: $80.4 million in fiscal2015 and $84.3 million in fiscal2016, both representing increases since funds were cut in fiscal 2011. In our view, the outlook for increased state funding for fiscal 20 17 is positive with the governor's budget recommendation calling for an 8.8% increase for four-year higher education institutions, the largest increase for higher education since 1991. The Idaho Department of Public Works (DPW) also provides capital funding for various construction projects and repairs at the university; the amount varies from year to year. The university's revenue composition has remained about the same over the past year with appropriations at 22% of total operating revenue, gross tuition and student fees and auxiliary revenue at 50%, grants and contracts at 8%, and gifts at 5%. BSU has a track record of producing surplus operations on a full-accrual basis with gains of $30.0 million in fiscal 2015, $28.8 million in fiscal2014, and $45.7 million in fiscal2012. BSU also reported a $2.9 million gain in net income before capital in fiscal2015. Management expects operating performance to continue to be positive in fiscal 2016. Continued enrollment changes have pressured net tuition revenue, but the university has been able to increase net tuition revenue per student through modest tuition increases. Full-time tuition for the 2015-2016 academic year was $6,876, an increase of 3.6%. For the 2016-2017 year, the board has approved a tuition increase of 2.6%, or a 3. 7% total increase WWW .STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT MARCH 24,2016 5 1603781 1 302443362 ATTACHMENT 4 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 67Boise State University, Idaho; Public Coll/Univ -Unlimited Student Fees when including student fees. In our view, these modest tuition increases should allow the university to continue to increase its net tuition revenue as enrollment stabilizes. Available resources We consider the university's financial resource ratios adequate for the rating category. Total net assets at June 30, 2015 declined by 1.4%, or negative $5.5 million, as a result of the GASB 68 accounting reclassification of negative $15.5 million. After adjustments for GASB 68 and the inclusion of the foundation's unrestricted net assets (UNA), BSU's available resources (as measured by adjusted UNA) totaled $127.5 million, equal to 34% of operating expenses and 61% of pro forma debt. The university benefits from a separate foundation that had total assets of $154.9 million as of June 30, 2015, of which only 7%, or $11 million, was unrestricted. The foundation's investment portfolio was valued at $93 million as of Dec. 31, 2015 and is conservatively invested. At that time, the foundation's funds were invested 33% in international equities, 25% in fixed income, 32% in domestic equities, and the remainder in cash, real estate, hedge funds, and private equity. Management reports that the foundation's return was 1.1% as of June 30, 2015 but that it decreased 2.5% through Dec. 31, 2015. The university's treasury portfolio is used to manage cash and was valued at $102.1 mil)ion as of Dec. 31, 2016 with 48% invested in the local government investment pool, 34% in corporate bonds, 6% in federal agency security, and 4% in the money market. At that time, the treasury account had an average weighted maturity of 128 days to provide liquidity when needed. Debt and contingent liabilities As of June 30, 2015, BSU had $219.4 million in debt outstanding, which included $634,000 in notes payable, which was paid off in March 2016, and $752,000 in capital lease obligations. The remainder is general revenue debt. Upon the issuance of the series 2016A bonds, pro forma debt outstanding is expected to be about $208.8 million. Total pro forma maximum annual debt service (MADS) of about $17.84 million in 2020 is still above average but manageable, at 4.8% offiscal2015 adjusted operating expenses. We view management's debt portfolio as conservative with all debt being fixed rate with level amortization. As outlined in its campus master plan, BSU plans to construct a $52 million materials science building and a $36 million fine arts building over the next five years. These projects will be financed through a combination of gifts, state support (for the fine arts building), and public debt. As part of the debt funding, management plans to issue about $57 million in total over the next two years with $2 7 million in new money for the materials science building and approximately $30 million for the fine arts building. In our view, the university should have the capacity to issue this debt so long as it is able to maintain its existing available resources. Standard & Poor's will further evaluate the debt's effect on credit quality once plans are more fully developed.

Enrollment in certain fine arts courses is currently limited due to lack of studio and classroom space. The Fine Arts Building is expected to cost approximately $42,000,000. With State support, private donations and University reserves contributing approximately $10,000,000, the remaining balance of approximately $32,000,000 will be financed by a portion of the proceeds of the 2017A Bonds. SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS The sources and uses of funds with respect to the 2017A Bonds are estimated to be as follows: SOURCES : Aggregate Principal Amount of 2017A Bonds ................................ ............ $ University Contribution ................................ ................................ ................................ .....

The University's Boise campus includes approximately 5.5 million gross square feet of facilities, with approximately 200 buildings. The Boise campus is approximately 220 acres including some parcels owned by university affiliate organizations such as the Boise State University Foundation, Inc. (the \"Foundation\"). New Facilities . The University recently purchased approximately 49,000 gross square feet of space in a mixed use facility in downtown Boise to house its Computer Science program. This mixed use facility is the result of a public private partnership and includes an expansion of the city of Boise's convention center, federally funded underground transit center, as well as retail and office spaces, anchored by a major technology company. The purchase was funded from University reserves, and no new debt was incurred. The University is also leasing 2,900 gross square feet for a bookstore and apparel shop. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 99ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 In October 2016 the new Alumni and Friends Center opened. This facility provides 40,000 square feet of office and event spaces. This joint venture between the Alumni Association and the Foundation (both separate non-profit organizations) provides new and expanded spaces to engage with University alumni and donors. This $12,000,000 facility was funded by private donations and the Foundation's issuance of approximately $5,000,000 of debt. The University will lease office space in this building for ten years, at which time the debt matures and the building will transfer to University ownership for an amount of ten dollars (the \"Alumni Agreement\"). The Alumni Agreement requires the University to make lease payments to the Foundation sufficient to repay the Foundation's debt issued to finance the Alumni and Friends Center, plus additional rent to pay certain other expenses related to the construction and operation of the Alumni and Friends Center. Additionally, the University will manage and maintain the facility. Facilities Generating Sales and Service Revenue . The following is a description of the University's major facilities from which Sales and Services Revenues are derived, including housing facilities, the Student Union Building, spectator and recreation facilities, and parking facilities. Housing Faciliti es. The University's housing facilities currently consist of (i) eight residence halls, six of which are traditional-style buildings and two of which are suite-style buildings, (ii) four apartment complexes for sophomore and above housing and (iii) one townhome development, which provides 360 beds for sophomore and above students. Of the University's Fall 2016 headcount enrollment of approximately 23,900 students, roughly [2,600] live in University housing facilities, of which the current capacity is approximately [2,600] students. University Residence Halls. The University's residence halls can accommodate approximately 2,180 students and offer a variety of amenities, including computer labs and in room high-speed internet connections; recreational and lounge space; laundry facilities; kitchen areas; and academic/study space. For Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016, the average fall semester occupancy rates for the University's residence halls were 99%, 91% and 99%, respectively. The increase in occupancy in Fiscal Year 2016 is due to the University converting an apartment complex to first year housing, creating 300 additional first year student bed spaces. University Apartments . The University apartment complexes are available for students, including those with families, and provide over 200 apartments ranging in size from one bEdRoom to three bEdRooms. For Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016, the average fall semester occupancy rates for the University's apartments were 90%, 98% and 100%, respectively. Future Housing Facilities . The University is currently experiencing increased demand for on-campus housing. For the Fall 2016 semester, there were approximately 400 more applications for on-campus housing than the University had available beds. For the 2016 -2017 academic year, the University partnered with private housing developments adjacent to its main campus to meet demand. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 100ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 The University expects the new 644-bed residential Honors College will open in the Fall of 2017. The University participated in a public private partnership agreement with EDR Boise, LLC, a subsidiary of Educational Realty Trust (\"EdR\"), a publicly traded REIT, to finance, construct, and operate the facility in partnership with the University. The University leased its property across from the Student Union Building to EdR under a 50-year ground lease, commencing in Fall of 2017, on which EdR has commenced construction of the Honors facility. In addition to 302 beds of Honors student housing and 342 beds of traditional student housing, the project includes offices, classrooms and food service. The food service component, with an estimated cost of approximately $5,500,000, will be financed and constructed by EdR and purchased by the University upon completion. The purchase will be funded with University reserves and a contribution from its food service contractor. The food service component will be owned and operated by the University, through its food service contractor. EdR will own the residential portion of Honors College and will pay rent to the University. EdR has funded the balance of the cost of this approximately $40,000,000 facility. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ground lease, EdR is not permitted to issue any debt secured by the property or its leasehold interest in the project, without University approval. EdR is required to pay the University an annual ground lease payment consisting of a guaranteed fixed amount, plus a percentage of the project's gross revenues. The fixed payment will escalate with the consumer price index. The ground lease and food service income is expected to generate a positive net income for the University. In conjunction with the opening of the Honors College, the University will convert the John B. Barnes towers (the \"Towers\"), a 300-bed student housing facility, for use only for overflow housi ng for Academic Year 2017-2018. For future years, depending on housing demand, the Towers may continue as overflow housing, be placed back online as a housing option, or repurposed into office space or another use. Student Union Building . Initially constructed in 1967 and expanded in 1988 and 2008, the Student Union Building provides extensive conference and meeting spaces, a 430 seat performance theater, a retail food court, a central production kitchen, a resident student and visitor dining facility, a University Bookstore and Bronco Shop, a convenience store, a games area, and offices for admissions, student government and student activities. The facilities infrastructure includes high speed LAN and video data capabilities and public lounges with wireless network capabilities. The building totals approximately 252,000 square feet. Spectator and Recreation Facilities . The University's spectator and recreation facilities include Albertsons Stadium, the Taco Bell Arena, the Recreation Center and the Morrison Center. The following is a brief description of these facilities. Albertsons Stadium . Originally constructed in 1970, and expanded in 1997, 2008, 2009 and 2012 to its current total capacity of 37,000 seats, Albertsons Stadium is Idaho's largest spectator facility. It is used for all of the University's intercollegiate home football games. The facility includes the press box, stadium suites, banquet facilities, a commercial kitchen, an additional Bronco Shop, office space, and concessions facilities. The Gene Bleymaier Football Complex, which opened in 2013, is a stand-alone addition to the Albertsons Stadium facilities, consisting of football offices and training facilities. This facility added 70,000 square feet of space. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 101ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 Taco Bell Arena . Taco Bell Arena was constructed in 1982 and serves as the University's indoor sports and entertainment complex. In its basketball configuration, the arena accommodates approximately 12,400 spectators.

EMPLOYEES As of September 30, 2016, the University had 5,862 employees. Faculty and staff include 1,318 professional staff, 1,353 faculty and other academic appointments, and 1,041 classified employees. The University also employed 2,150 students. The University is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement, although there are employee associations that bring salary issues and other concerns to the attention of the University. The University considers relations with its employees to be good. EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT BENEFITS [UPDATE -- CAFR NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL DECEMBER ] All benefit eligible employees, which consist of employees who work 20 or more hours per week for five consecutive months, must enroll in one of two retirement plans\u2014the State's Public Employees' Retirement System of Idaho (\" PERSI \") or the Optional Retirement Program (\"ORP \"), which is a plan offered to faculty and non-classified staff effective 1990 and thereafter. PERSI. The University's classified employees, including its faculty hired prior to July 1, 1990, are covered under PERSI. Additionally, new faculty and professional staff who are vested BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 103ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 in PERSI have the option of remaining in or returning to PERSI with written affirmation of this decision within 60 days of employment. PERSI is the administrator of a multiple-employer cost- sharing defined benefit public employee retirement system. A retirement board (the \" PERSI Board\"), appointed by the governor and confirmed by the State Senate, manages the system, including selecting investment managers to direct the investment, exchange and liquidation of assets in the managed accounts and establishing policy for asset allocation and other investment guidelines. The PERSI Board is charged with the fiduciary responsibility of administering the system. PERSI is the administrator of seven fiduciary funds, including three defined benefit retirement plans, the Public Employee Retirement Fund Base Plan (\" PERSI Base Plan \"), the Firefighters' Retirement Fund (\" FRF\"), and the Judges' Retirement Fund (\" JRF\"), of which, PERSI assumed administration effective July 1, 2014; two defined contribution plans, the Public Employee Retirement Fund Choice Plans 414(k) and 401(k); and two Sick Leave Insurance Reserve Trust Funds, one for State employers and one for school district employers. PERSI membership is mandatory for eligible employees of participating employers. Employees must be: (i) working 20 hours per week or more; (ii) teachers working a half-time contract or greater; or (iii) persons who are elected or appointed officials. Membership is mandatory for State agency and local school district employees, and membership by contract is permitted for participating political subdivisions such as cities and counties. On July 1, 2015, PERSI h ad 67,008 active members, 29,827 inactive members (of whom 11,859 are entitled to vested benefits), and 42,657 annuitants. As of July 1, 2015, there were 766 participating employe rs in the PERSI Base Plan. Total membership in PERSI was 139,492. The net position for all pension and other funds administered by PERSI increased $262 million during Fiscal Year 2015 and increased over $2 billion during the Fiscal Year 2014. The increase in the defined benefit plans reflects the total of contributions received and an investment return exceeding benefits paid and administrative expenses. All of the plans experienced investment gains in Fiscal Year 2015 as a result of positive market performance. Net investment income for all of the funds administered by PERSI for the Fiscal Years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was $417 million and $2.0 billion, respectively. The large discrepancy between net investment income for 2014 and 2015 is primarily due to a large gross investment return in 2014. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, the funding ratio (actuarial value of assets divided by actuarial accrued liability) for the unfunded actuarial liability for the PERSI Base Plan was 90.4% and 93.9%, respectively. The higher the funding ratio, the better the plan is funded. The amortization period (estimated time to payoff unfunded liability) for PERSI's Base Plan as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was 17.4 years and 5.5 years, respectively. The actuarial funding ratio for the PERSI Base Plan decreased from 2014 primarily because investment performance was less than the actuarial expected rate. The amortization period increased for the same reason. Annual actuarial valuations for PERSI are provided by the private actuarial firm of Milliman, which has provided the actuarial valuations for PERSI since PERSI's inception. As a result of the statutory requirement that the amortization period for the unfunded actuarial liability be 25 years or less, contribution rate increases for the three years beginning July 1, 2011, as proposed by the actuary, were reviewed and approved by the PERSI Board on December 8, 2009. Only one of the approved contribution rate increases has taken effect to date, on July 1, BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 104ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 2013. All other approved contribution rate increases were cancelled. The contribution rates for the year ended June 30, 2015 follow: Contribution Rates Member Employer General/ Teacher Fire/ Source: Financial Statements June 30, 2015 Public Employee Retirement System of Idaho The next major PERSI experience study, to be completed in 2016, will cover the period July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2015. The University's required and paid contributions to PERSI for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016 were $3,045,994 and $3,138,685, respectively. Contribution requirements of PERSI and its members are established by the PERSI Board within limitations, as defined by state law. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2015, the University became required to record a liability and expense equal to its proportionate share of the collective net pension liability and expense of PERSI due to the implementation of GASB 68. The University recorded a net pension liability as of June 30, 2016 of $12,652,677 representing its proportionate share of liability under PERSI. PERSI issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information. That report may be obtained at, www.persi.idaho.gov (which website is provided purely for convenience and is not incorporated or made a part of this Official Statement by this reference). Much of the information in this section comes from the PERSI Financial Statements, June 30, 2015, and therefore the information is from a source not within the University 's control. ORP. Faculty and non-classified staff hired on or after July 1, 1990 have been enrolled in ORP, and faculty and staff hired before that date were offered a one time opportunity in 1990 to withdraw from PERSI and join ORP. ORP is a portable, multiple-employer, defined contribution retirement plan with options offered by Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association/College Retirement Equities Fund and Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company. The total contribution rate is the same for all employees, with a portion of the employer's contribution for ORP members being credited to the employee's account and a portion to the PERSI unfunded liability until 2015. Contribution requirements for ORP are based on a percentage of total payroll. The University's contribution rate for Fiscal Years 2015 and 2016 was 9.26%. For Fiscal Years 2014, 2015 and 2016, the University's required and paid contributions to ORP were $9,245,096, $9,957,020, and $10,480,089 respectively. The employee contribution rate for Fiscal Years 2014 through 2016 is 6.97% of covered payroll. These employer and employee contributions, in addition to earnings from investments, fund ORP benefits. The University has no additional obligation to fund ORP benefits once it makes the required BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 105ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 contributions at the applicable rate. The University has made all contributions that it is required to make to ORP to date. For additional information concerning the University's pension benefits, see Note 10 of \"Appendix A\u2014 A UDITED FINANCIA L STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 .\" OPEB . The University participates in other multiple-employer defined benefit post- employment benefit plans relating to health and disability for retired or disabled employees that are administered by the State of Idaho, as agent, as well as a single-employer defined benefit life insurance plan. Idaho Code establishes the benefits and contribution obligations relating to these plans. The most recent actuarial valuation of these plans is as of July 1, 2012. The University funds these benefits on a pay- as-you-go basis, which the University has continued to make on a timely basis: the University has not set aside any assets to pay future benefits under such plans. As of July 1, 2012, the University's proportionate share of the combined unfunded accrued actuarial liability for such plans equaled approximately $17.7 million. For additional information concerning post-retirement benefits other than pensions, see Note 11 of \"A PPENDIX A\u2014 AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015 .\" INSURANCE The University has liability coverage under commercial insurance policies and self- insurance through the State of Idaho Retained Risk Fund. University buildings are covered by all risk property insurance on a replacement cost basis. FINANCIAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNIVERSITY The principal sources of University revenues are direct appropriation of State revenues by the State legislature (the \" Legislature \"), Student Fees, federal government appropriations, grants and contracts, gifts to the University, F&A Recovery Revenues, Investment Income, Sales and Services Revenues, and Other Operating Revenues. Of these revenue sources, Student Fees, Investment Income, Sales and Services Revenues, F&A Recovery Revenues, and Other Operating Revenues are included in Pledged Revenues. The following describes revenue sources that are not included in Pledged Revenues, as well as certain Pledged Revenues. See \"SECURITY FOR THE 2017A BONDS .\" STATE APPROPRIATIONS Legislatively-approved State appropriations represent approximately 19.9% of the University's total annual revenues for Fiscal Year 2017. Such revenues are not included as Pledged Revenues. The Legislature meets beginning in January of each calendar year and sets budgets and appropriations for all agencies and departments of State government for the fiscal year beginning the following July 1. The Legislature may also make adjustments to budgets and appropriations for the fiscal year during which the Legislature is meeting. If, in the course of a fiscal year, the Governor determines that the expenditures authorized by the Legislature for the current fiscal year exceed anticipated revenues expected to be available to meet those expenditures, the Governor, by executive order, may reduce (\" Holdback \") the BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 106ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 spending authority on file in the office of the Division of Financial Management for any department, agency or institution of the State, or request a reversion (\" Reversion \") of appropriations back to the State to balance the State budget. There have been no Holdbacks or Reversions since Fiscal Year 2010; the University does not anticipate a Holdback or Reversion during Fiscal Year 2017. Although State appropriations are not included in Pledged Revenues, Holdbacks, Reversions or reductions in the amount appropriated to the University could adversely affect the University's financial and operating position. The table below sets forth the Legislative appropriations from the State General Fund for all higher education institutions and for the University for the Fiscal Years shown. Legislative appropriations reached a pre-recession high in 2009 of approximately $285 million for all higher education, but declined sharply during the recession to an approximate low of $209 million in 2012. Since the 2012 low, State appropriations have steadily climbed to approximately $279 million in 2017. STATE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATIONS _____________________ 1Audited. *Unaudited. GRANTS AND CONTRACTS Through various grant and contract programs, the United States government and various other public and private sponsoring agencies, provide a substantial percentage of the University's current revenues. The use of such funds is usually restricted to specific projects and is not included in the appropriated budget for the University. Such revenues include grants and contracts for research, public service, instruction and training programs, fellowships, scholarships, endowment scholarship programs, student aid programs, and grants for construction projects. The University believes it has complied with all material conditions and requirements of these grants and contracts. For Fiscal Year 2016, total grants and contracts totaled $36,346,470, which amount includes the $5,208,537 of F&A Recovery Revenues included in Pledged Revenues. The University also received $24,169,872 in federal Pell Grants for the 2015-2016 academic year. The following table displays federally funded expenditures, which include Pell Grants and direct loan programs, for each the last four Fiscal Years: FISCAL YEAR 2014 2015 2016 2017* All Higher Education $76,338,100 $80,391,900 $85,579,9001 $92,968,100 Percentage Increase (Decrease) over the University 2.5% 5.3% 6.4% 8.6% BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 107ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 GRANTS AND CONTRACTS EXPENDITURES (in 000s)* FISCAL YEAR 2013 2014 2015 2016 Federal financial aid. Pledged Revenues do not include Restricted Fund Revenues, which consist of revenues that the University is obligated to spend in accordance with restrictions imposed by external third parties, such as revenues from grants, contracts, gifts and scholarships. However, Pledged Revenues do include F&A Recovery Revenues, which consist of revenues received by the University as reimbursement for facility and administrative costs in conjunction with grants and contracts for research activities conducted by the University. See \"S ECURITY FOR THE 2017A BONDS -Pledged Revenues-Facilities and Administrative Recovery Revenues\" and \"Historical Revenue s Available for Debt Service\" above. Direct financial aid to students, primarily in the form of student loans, scholarships, grants, student employment, awards, and deferred payments, totaled approximately $142,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2016. Of such amount, approximately $70,000,000 was in the form of direct student loans. Due to uncertainty with respect to the amount of federal grants, donations, and other sources the University expects to receive for the purpose of providing financial aid, the University cannot determine the amount of financial aid that will be available in future years. BUDGET PROCESS The University operates on an annual budget system. Its Fiscal Year begins July 1 of each year. The budget process, as well as the administration of the expenditures authorized through the process, is administered through the offices of the President and the Vice President for Finance and Administration, in collaboration with the departmental faculty and administrative officers. The internal budget process concludes with a general budget proposal for the following Fiscal Year being submitted in consolidated form by the University Administration to the Board in August of each year. The University's operating budget is approved by the Board prior to the commencement of the Fiscal Year, usually at its June meeting. At that meeting, the Board, serving also as the governing boards of the State's other institutions of higher education, approves the annual budgets for those institutions as well. INVESTMENT POLICY Board policy establishes permitted investment categories for the University. The University's investment policy establishes, in order of priority, safety of principal preservation, BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 108ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 ensuring necessary liquidity, and achieving a maximum return, as the objectives of its investment portfolio.

NO INTERES T RATE SWAPS The University has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivative products. BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY FOUNDATION , INC. The Boise State University Foundation, Inc. is a nonprofit corporation organized under State law in 1967. Its purpose is to receive, manage and otherwise deal in property and apply the income, principal and proceeds of such property for the benefit of the University. An approximately 41 member board of directors manages the Foundation. Royanne Minskoff currently serves as Chairman of the board of directors of the Foundation. Financial statements for the Foundation are contained in Note 13 to the University's financial statements. See \"A PPENDIX A- AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY FOR THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2016 AND 2015.\" Net assets of the Foundation at June 30, 2016 were $168,055,097. In June 2011, the Foundation completed its first comprehensive fundraising campaign. The Foundation's Destination Distinction campaign exceeded the original campaign goal by $10 million, raising over $185 million to support scholarships, programs and facilities, much of which has already been spent on various projects. In 2013, the Foundation began a campaign for scholarships with a goal of $25 million. As of September 30, 2016, the campaign has raised over $43 million and continues. The Foundation is also currently seeking funds for specific strategic initiatives including the Fine Arts Building and Materials Science Building described below. FUTURE CAPITAL PROJECTS To address the educational needs of the region and the facilities needs of the growing student body, the University implemented a Strategic Facility Fee in 2006, which the University merged with other facility fees in 2016 as part of the combined Capital Projects and Facilities Fee. The Capital Projects and Facilities Fee is a component of Student Fees which are included in Pledged Revenues. Revenues from the Capital Projects and Facilities Fee are intended to be used together with donations, State of Idaho Permanent Building Fund monies provided by the State, capital grants and University reserves to provide funds for construction of buildings pursuant to the University's Campus Master Plan. The University may not undertake any capital project or long-term financing without prior Board approval. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 109ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 In addition to the Fine Arts Building, the University currently anticipates that it may issue Additional Bonds or other debt to finance capital facilities within the next one to two years to finance a Materials Science Building, which is currently in the programming and design phase. The Materials Science Building is expected to cost approximately $52,000,000, of which the Micron Foundation has already pledged $25,000,000. The expected amount of Additional Bonds to be issued to finance construction of the Materials Science Building is the balance of $27,000,000.

BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 111ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 TAX MATTERS 2017A BONDS In the opinion of Bond Counsel, assuming continuous compliance with certain covenants described below: (i) interest on the 2017A Bonds is excluded from gross income pursuant to Section 103 of the Tax Code; (ii) interest on the 2017A Bonds is excluded from alternative minimum taxable income as defined in Section 55(b)(2) of the Tax Code except that such interest is required to be included in calculating the \"adjusted current earnings\" adjustment applicable to corporations for purposes of computing the alternative minimum taxable income of corporations as described below; and (iii) interest on the 2017A Bonds is excluded from gross income for purposes of income taxation by the State of Idaho. The Tax Code imposes several requirements which must be met with respect to the 2017A Bonds in order for the interest thereon to be excluded from gross income and alternative minimum taxable income (except to the extent of the aforementioned adjustment applicable to corporations). Certain of these requirements must be met on a continuous basis throughout the term of the 2017A Bonds. These requirements include: (a) limitations as to the use of proceeds of the 2017A Bonds; (b) limitations on the extent to which proceeds of the 2017A Bonds may be invested in higher yielding investments; and (c) a provision, subject to certain limited exceptions, that requires all investment earnings on the proceeds of the 2017A Bonds above the yield on the 2017A Bonds to be paid to the United States Treasury. The exclusion of interest on the 2017A Bonds from gross income for Idaho income tax purposes is dependent on the interest on the 2017A Bonds being excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes. The University will covenant and represent that it will take all steps to comply with the requirements of the Tax Code to the extent necessary to maintain the exclusion of interest on the 2017A Bonds from gross income and alternative minimum taxable income (except to the extent of the aforementioned adjustment applicable to corporations) under such federal income tax laws in effect when the 2017A Bonds are delivered. Bond Counsel's opinion as to the exclusion of interest on the 2017A Bonds from gross income (for federal and Idaho income tax purposes) and alternative minimum taxable income (to the extent described above) is rendered in reliance on these covenants, and assumes continuous compliance therewith. The failure or inability of the University to comply with these requirements could cause the interest on the 2017A Bonds to be included in gross income (for federal and Idaho income tax purposes), alternative minimum taxable income or both from the date of issuance. Bond Counsel's opinion also is rendered in reliance upon certifications of the University and other certifications furnished to Bond Counsel. Bond Counsel has not undertaken to verify such certifications by independent investigation. Section 55 of the Tax Code contains a 20% alternative minimum tax on the alternative minimum taxable income of corporations. Under the Tax Code, 75% of the excess of a corporation's \"adjusted current earnings\" over the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income (determined without regard to this adjustment and the alternative minimum tax net operating loss deduction) is included in the corporation's alternative minimum taxable income for purposes of the alternative minimum tax applicable to the corporation. \"Adjusted current earnings\" includes interest on the 2017A Bonds. The Tax Code contains numerous provisions which may affect an investor's decision to purchase the 2017A Bonds. Owners of the 2017A Bonds should be aware that the ownership of BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 112ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 tax-exempt obligations by particular persons and entities, including, without limitation, financial institutions, insurance companies, recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits, taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred or continued indebtedness to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations, foreign corporations doing business in the United States and certain \"subchapter S\" corporations may result in adverse federal and state tax consequences. Under Section 3406 of the Tax Code, backup withholding may be imposed on payments on the 2017A Bonds made to any owner who fails to provide certain required information, including an accurate taxpayer identification number, to certain persons required to collect such information pursuant to the Tax Code. Backup withholding may also be applied if the owner underreports \"reportable payments\" (including interest and dividends) as defined in Section 3406, or fails to provide a certificate that the owner is not subject to backup withholding in circumstances where such a certificate is required by the Tax Code. With respect to any of the 2017A Bonds sold at a premium, representing a difference between the original offering price of those 2017A Bonds and the principal amount thereof payable at maturity, under certain circumstances, an initial owner of such bonds (if any) may realize a taxable gain upon their disposition, even though such bonds are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to the owner's acquisition cost. Bond Counsel's opinion relates only to the exclusion of interest on the 2017A Bonds from gross income (for federal and Idaho income tax purposes) and alternative minimum taxable income as described above and will state that no opinion is expressed regarding other federal or state tax consequences arising from the receipt or accrual of interest on or ownership of the 2017A Bonds. Owners of the 2017A Bonds should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of these consequences. The opinions expressed by Bond Counsel are based on existing law as of the delivery date of the 2017A Bonds. No opinion is expressed as of any subsequent date nor is any opinion expressed with respect to pending or proposed legislation. Amendments to the federal or state tax laws may be pending now or could be proposed in the future that, if enacted into law, could adversely affect the value of the 2017A Bonds, the exclusion of interest on the 2017A Bonds from gross income (for federal and Idaho income tax purposes) or alternative minimum taxable income or both from the date of issuance of the 2017A Bonds or any other date, the tax value of that exclusion for different classes of taxpayers from time to time, or that could result in other adverse tax consequences. In addition, future court actions or regulatory decisions could affect the tax treatment or market value of the 2017A Bonds. Owners of the 2017A Bonds are advised to consult with their own tax advisors with respect to such matters. The Internal Revenue Service (the \" Service \") has an ongoing program of auditing tax- exempt obligations to determine whether, in the view of the Service, interest on such tax-exempt obligations is includable in the gross income of the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. No assurances can be given as to whether or not the Service will commence an audit of the 2017A Bonds. If an audit is commenced, the market value of the 2017A Bonds may be adversely affected. Under current audit procedures the Service will treat the University as the taxpayer and the 2017A Bond owners may have no right to participate in such procedures. The University has covenanted not to take any action that would cause the interest on the 2017A Bonds to lose its exclusion from gross income for federal income tax purposes or lose its exclusion from alternative minimum taxable income except to the extent described above for the owners thereof for federal income tax purposes. None of the University, the Underwriter, or Bond Counsel is responsible for paying or reimbursing any 2017A Bond holder with respect to any audit or litigation costs relating to the 2017A Bonds. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 113ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 [Premium Bonds ]. The initial public offering price of certain maturities of the 2017A Bonds (the \" Premium Bonds \"), as shown on the inside cover page, are issued at original offering prices in excess of their original principal amount. The difference between the amount of the Premium Bonds at the original offering price and the principal amount payable at maturity represents \"bond premium\" under the Tax Code. As a result of requirements of the Tax Code relating to the amortization of bond premium, under certain circumstances an initial owner of a Premium Bond may realize a taxable gain upon disposition of such a bond, even though such bond is sold or redeemed for an amount equal to the original owner's cost of acquiring such bond. All owners of 2017A Bonds are advised that they should consult with their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of owning and disposing of 2017A Bonds, whether the disposition is pursuant to a sale of the 2017A Bonds or other transfer, or redemption. Original Issue Discount . The initial public offering price of certain maturities of the 2017A Bonds (the \" Discount Bonds \"), as shown on the inside cover page hereof, is less than the amount payable on such 2017A Bonds at maturity. The difference between the amount of the Discount Bonds payable at maturity and the initial public offering price of the Discount Bonds will be treated as \"original issue discount\" for federal income tax purposes. The original issue discount on the Discount Bonds is treated as accruing over the respective terms of such Discount Bonds on the basis of a constant interest rate compounded at the end of each six-month period (or shorter period from the date of original issue) ending on April 1 and October 1 with straight line interpolation between compounding dates. In the case of a purchaser who acquires the Discount Bonds in this offering, the amount of original issue discount accruing each period (calculated as described in the preceding sentence) constitutes interest which is excluded from gross income, alternative minimum taxable income and Idaho taxable income under the conditions and subject to the exceptions described in the preceding paragraphs and will be added to the owner's basis in the Discount Bonds. Such adjusted basis will be used to determine taxable gain or loss upon disposition of the Discount Bonds (including sale or payment at maturity). Beneficial Owners who purchase Discount Bonds in the initial offering at a price other than the original offering price shown on the inside cover page hereof and owners who purchase Discount Bonds after the initial offering should consult their own tax advisors with respect to the tax consequences of the ownership of the Discount Bonds. Beneficial Owners who are subject to state or local income taxation (other than Idaho state income taxation) should consult their tax advisor with respect to the state and local income tax consequences of ownership of the Discount Bonds. It is possible that, under the applicable provisions governing determination of state and local taxes, accrued original issue discount on the Discount Bonds may be deemed to be received in the year of accrual even though there will not be a corresponding cash payment .] ESCROW VERIFICATI ON The Arbitrage Group, Inc. will verify the accuracy of the mathematical computations concerning the adequacy of the maturing principal amounts of and interest earned on the government obligations, together with other escrowed moneys, to pay interest on the Refunded Bonds as the same falls due and the redemption price of, and interest on, the Refunded Bonds on the respective redemption dates, and the mathematical computations of the yield on the 2017A Bonds and the yield on the government obligations purchased with a portion of the proceeds of BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 114ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 the sale of the 2017A Bonds. Such verification shall be based in part upon information supplied by the Underwriter. UNDERWRITING The 2017A Bonds are being purchased by the Underwriter. The purchase contract provides that the Underwriter will purchase all of the 2017A Bonds, if any are purchased, at a price of $__________, representing the principal amount of the 2017A Bonds, plus original issuance premium of $_________, and less an Underwriter's discount of $_________. The Underwriter may offer and sell the 2017A Bonds to certain dealers (including dealers depositing the 2017A Bonds in investment trusts) and others at prices lower than the initial offering prices (or prices corresponding to the yields) stated on the inside cover page hereof. RATINGS Moody's Investors Service has assigned its municipal rating of \"____\" to the 2017A Bonds. S&P Global Ratings has assigned its municipal rating of \"____\" to the 2017A Bonds. The ratings reflect only the views of the rating agencies. An explanation of the significance of the ratings may be obtained from the rating agencies. There is no assurance that such ratings will continue for any given period of time or that the ratings may not be revised or withdrawn entirely if, in the judgment of the rating agencies, circumstances so warrant. Any downward revision or withdrawal of such ratings will be likely to have an adverse effect on the market price or marketability of the 2017A Bonds. LITIGATION The University has reported that, as of the date hereof, there is no litigation pending or threatened that, if decided adversely to the interests of the University, would have a materially adverse effect on the operations or financial position of the University. There is no litigation of any nature now pending or threatened restraining or enjoining the issuance or sale of the 2017A Bonds or in any way contesting or affecting the validity of, or having a material adverse effect on, the 2017A Bonds, the pledge and application of Pledged Revenues, or the existence or powers of the University. APPROVAL OF LEGAL MATTERS All legal matters incident to the authorization and issuance of the 2017A Bonds are subject to the approval of Hawley Troxell Ennis & Hawley LLP, Bond Counsel to the University. Bond Counsel's approving opinion in the form of Appendix F hereto will be delivered with the 2017A Bonds. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the University by the Office of General Counsel. Certain matters will be passed upon for the Underwriter by its counsel, Foster Pepper PLLC, and by Hawley Troxell Ennis & Hawley LLP, in its role as disclosure counsel to the University. Any opinion delivered by Foster Pepper PLLC will be limited in scope, addressed only to the Underwriter and cannot be relied upon by investors. BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 115ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 CONTINUING DISCLOSURE The University will enter into a Continuing Disclosure Undertaking (the \" Undertaking \") for the benefit of the Beneficial Owners of the 2017A Bonds. Pursuant to the Undertaking, the University will agree to send certain information annually and to provide notice of certain events to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board pursuant to the requirements of Section (b)(5) of Rule 15c2-12 (the \" Rule\") adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information to be provided on an annual basis, the events which will be noticed on an occurrence basis, and a summary of other terms of the Undertaking, including termination, amendment, and remedies, are set forth in the Undertaking, the proposed form of which is attached as A PPENDIX E to this Official Statement. The University has materially complied with its continuing disclosure undertakings, although its filing was 17 days late for Fiscal Year 2013. The University has taken steps to ensure timely future compliance. See \"A PPENDIX E- PROPOSED FORM OF CONTINUING DISCLOSURE UNDERTAKING - Consequences of Failure of the University to Provide Information.\" A failure by the University to comply with the Undertaking must be reported in accordance with the Rule and must be considered by any broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer before recommending the purchase or sale of the 2017A Bonds in the secondary market. Consequently, such a failure may adversely affect the transferability and liquidity of the 2017A Bonds and their market price.

The amounts shown as Annual Estimated Revenue reflect the University's estimates based on actual collections for Fall 2016 and estimated of collections for Spring 2017 and Summer 2017. The University's estimates include certain assumptions concerning refunds, late fees and other variables with respect to individual fees, such that the annual estimated revenues of each fee are not the numerical product of the fee rates times a constant number for students paying such fees, but nonetheless represent the University's best estimate of fee revenues. The number of students used to calculate Estimated Annual Revenue is less than the total number of full time equivalent students as a result of the University's policy to provide fee waivers or discounts to certain scholarship recipients and to certain employees and spouses of certain employees. Full-time undergraduate students are defined as students taking 12 credit hours or more and full-time graduate students are defined as students taking nine credit hours or more per semester.

The Depository Trust Company (\"DTC\"), New York, NY, will act as securities depository for the securities (the \"Securities\"). The Securities will be issued as fully -registered securities registered in the name of Cede & Co. (DTC's partnership nominee) or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. One fully-registered Security certificate will be issued for [each issue of] the Securities, [each] in the aggregate principal amount of such issue, and will be deposited with DTC. [If, however, the aggregate principal amount of [any] issue exceeds $500 million, one certificate will be issued with respect to each $500 million of principal amount, and an additional certificate will be issued with respect to any remaining principal amount of such issue.] 2. DTC, the world's largest securities depository, is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a \"banking organization\" within the meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a \"clearing corporation\" within the meaning of the New York Uniform Co mmercial Code, and a \"clearing agency\" registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for over 3.6 million issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity issues, corporate and municipal debt issues, and money market instruments (from over 100 countries) that DTC's participants (\"Direct Participants\") deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities, through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between Direct Participants' accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (\"DTCC\"). DTCC is the holding company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant, either directly or indirectly (\"Indirect Participants\"). DTC has a Standard & Poor's rating of: AA+ . The DTC Rules applicable to its Participants are on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about DTC can be found at www.dtcc.com. 3. Purchases of Securities under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants, which will receive a credit for the Securities on DTC's records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Security (\"Beneficial Owner\") is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants' records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase. Beneficial Owners are, however, expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements of their holdings, from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which the Beneficial Owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in the Securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 124ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 in Securities, except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Securities is discontinued. 4. To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Securities deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC's partnership nominee, Cede & Co., or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of Securities with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other DTC nominee do not affect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Securities; DTC's records r eflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts such Securities are credited, which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect Participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. 5. Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants, by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants, and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. [Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to take certain steps to augment the transmission to them of notices of significant events with respect to the Securities, such as redemptions, tenders, defaults, and proposed amendments to the Security documents. For example, Beneficial Owners of Securities may wish to ascertain that the nominee holding the Securities for their benefit has agreed to obtain and transmit notices to Beneficial Owners. In the alternative, Beneficial Owners may wish to provide their names and addresses to the registrar and request that copies of notices be provided directly to them.] [6. Redemption notices shall be sent to DTC. If less than all of the Securities within an issue are being redeemed, DTC's practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each Direct Participant in such issue to be redeemed.] 7. Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor any other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to Securities unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC's MMI Procedures. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an Omnibus Proxy to Issuer as soon as possible after the record date. The Omnibus Proxy assign s Cede & Co.'s consenting or voting rights to those Direct Participants to whose accounts Securities are credited on the record date (identified in a listing attached to the Omnibus Proxy). 8. Redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments on the Securities will be made to Cede & Co., or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. DTC's practice is to credit Direct Participants' accounts upon DTC's receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from Issuer or Agent, on payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC's records. Payments by Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in \"street name,\" and will be the responsibility of such Participant and not of DTC, Agent, or Issuer, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of redemption proceeds, distributions, and dividend payments to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC) is the responsibility of Issuer or Agent, disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC, and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners will be the responsibility of Direct and Indirect Participants. [9. A Beneficial Owner shall give notice to elect to have its Securities purchased or tendered, through its Participant, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent, and shall effect delivery of such Securities by causing the Direct Participant to transfer the Participant's interest in the Securities, on DTC's records, to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent. The requirement for physical delivery of Securities in connection with an optional tender or a mandatory purchase will be deemed satisfied when the ownership rights in the Securities are transferred by Direct Participants on DTC's records and followed by a book -entry credit of tendered Securities to [Tender/Remarketing] Agent's DTC account.] BAHR - SECTION II TAB 2 Page 125ATTACHMENT 7 03509.0164.8352627.9 10. DTC may discontinue providing its services as depository with respect to the Securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to Issuer or Agent. Under such circumstances, in the event that a successor depository is not obtained, Security certificates are required to be printed and delivered. 11. Issuer may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry-only transfers through DTC (or a successor securities depository). In that event, Security certificates will be printed and delivered to DTC. 12. The information in this section concerning DTC and DTC's book -entry system has been obtained from sources that Issuer believes to be reliable, but Issuer takes no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

BSU has identified property (owned by the University), located on the northern portion of the block between Belmont and Beacon Streets and between Euclid and Manitou Avenues, as a suitable site for the relocated functions, which will be designated collectively as the \"Campus Planning and Facilities (CPF)\" Building. The CPF Building will contain high-bay storage/receiving space, two floors of administrative offices, a loading bay, and an outdoor loading dock. The building is expected to house the FOAM/Central Receiving functions, while accommodating expansion and the future inclusion of additional campus planning and facilities groups and functions including a yard for parking, equipment storage and wash down area, and a hazardous waste structure. BSU will use a design-build delivery approach for this project and will work with the Division of Public Works (DPW) to make a qualifications-based selection for the design-build team. A portion of the Materials Science Budget has been identified to fund relocation and consolidation of these functions. IMPACT Total project costs for the CPF building have been estimated at $1.5 million, with design costs estimated between $1 20,000 and $150,000. BSU will return to the Board for approval to proceed with construction.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION In August 2015 , the Board approved a ground lease (\"Ground Lease\") and operating agreement (\"Operating Agreement\") with EdR Boise LLC (\"EdR\"), which provides for the construction and operation of a new residential Honors College and additional student housing project on Boise State University's (BSU) campus (the \"Honors College\"). The Honors College will include dining spaces, to be o wned and operated by BSU, in accordance with the terms of the Ground Lease as approved by the Board in August 2015. Dining Spaces The Ground Lease provides for EdR to construct the dining spaces for $3,490,458, of which $883,200 will be used for improvements to the space beyond shell and core; such improvements will be specific to BSU's design and intended food concept. The Ground Lease further provides that BSU may elect for EdR to complete the full buildout of the space, according to the specifications of BSU. BSU has revised the original specifications for the dining spaces, and elected for EdR to complete the full buildout, to include all furniture, fixtures and equipment. The additional cost of the full food service build-out is approximately $2 million in addition to the existing $3,490,458 already committed. The total estimated budget is approximately $5.5 million. The attached Letter Agreement memorializes BSU's election to have EdR complete the buildout. In accordance with the terms of the Ground Lease, BSU intends to purchase the dining spaces \"tu rn-key\" upon substantial completion of the construction for an amount not to exceed $5.5 million. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 2 The approximately 14,720 square foot dining space will focus on fresh food concepts, enhancing the quality of food provided to students on campus, and is currently anticipated to include: 1) Soup/Salad/Sandwich, 2) Oriental Grille Area, 3) Home Style Food . The concepts may change as a result of equipment bids and based on a market study of student s. The space also will include a seating and dining area with bathrooms, the food services area and a closed kitchen. The seating/dining area has been designed to be open 24/7 , if so desired , for studying or programming of events for the building. BSU funds this project utilizing a $2 million contribution from BSU's food service provider , and the remainder of the funds will come from BSU and auxiliary housing and dining reserves. Letter Agreement The Ground Lease and Operating Agreement provide for changes in the construction and design of the Honors College upon request and approval by BSU and at its expense. BSU has requested a change in the plans and specifications to replace twelve student beds with three 800 square foot units, each of which will include two-bedrooms, two bathrooms, a kitchen and living room, to provide apartments for faculty in residence or similar residence life staff for BSU's Residential College. There will be one faculty apartment on the fifth floor in the residential space for the Honors College students, and two faculty apartments in the freshman living community, one on the fourth floor and one on the fifth floor . The attached Letter Agreement confirms that EdR is converting the space into faculty apartments, as requested, and that BSU will pay up to $60,000 for such conversions, reflecting the actual cost to convert the student beds to faculty apartments. In addition, the proposed Letter Agreement confirms that BSU will pay the rental amount, representing the amount EdR would have collected for the twelve student beds, commencing at $82,000 for academic year 2017-2018, and subject to increase on the same terms as other rental increases provided for in the Operating Agreement. Finally, EdR has also requested several additional clarifications to provisions already in the Ground Lease, specifically including timing of payments owed by BSU under the Ground Lease. First, the proposed Letter Agreement confirms that BSU will pay up to $500,000 for a system that provides for reclamation and retention of graywater, in accordance with Section 3.02(b) of the Ground Lease, which amount will be paid on the Rent Commencement Date. BSU expects the amount to be less than $500,000, and it is currently expected to be around $350,000, which provides some savings to BSU. In addition, the Ground Lease requires BSU to be responsible for remediation of certain hazardous materials discovered during the development and construction of the project. BSU has previously agreed to repay EdR for certain remediation BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 4 Page 3 conducted by EdR during construction in the amount of $252,287.63 due to the remediation of an underground storage tank. The Letter Agreement confirms that BSU hereby agrees to pay this amount on the Rent Commencement Date. Finally, the attached Letter Agreement clarifies that EdR will provide wireless service throughout the Honors College, including dining spaces, and BSU will pay for wireless service in the dining spaces only in the same manner as it will pay for o ther utilities in the dining space. BSU has requested EdR provide this in order to provide a seamless experience for users of the space and residents in particular. IMPACT The primary terms and conditions of the attached Letter Agreement are as described above: EdR will fund the development of the food service space, including a full build out and all furniture, fixtures and equipment, and, upon completion, BSU will purchase the space as contemplated by the Ground Lease. The existing commitment for core and shell is approximately $3,500,000 with an additional payment of $2,000,000 for the full building project, including furniture, fixtures, and equipment, for a total amount not to exceed $5. 5 million . EdR will convert 12 student beds into 3 faculty apartments, for a payment of up to $60,000 from BSU for one-time development and construction costs, plus annual rent from BSU in the amount of $82,000, subject to escalation as provided in the Operating Agreement. BSU will pay up to $500,000 to EdR for the actual cost of a graywater system, payable on the Rent Commencement Date. BSU will pay $252,287.63 to EdR for the actual cost of certain hazardous waste remediation, as required by the Ground Lease, payable on the Rent Commencement Date. EdR will provide wireless internet service to the entire Honors College Project, including the food service spaces. BSU will pay for the wireless service to the dining spaces only, in the same manner as utilities in accordance with the Ground Lease. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1- Letter Agreement Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In discussions with Board Staff, BSU confirmed that anticipated auxiliary operations revenues and auxiliary reserves are sufficient to cover the additional $2 million cost of the complete facility buildout (including furniture, fixtures, and equipment) within the revised overall project cost of $5.5 million. Staff recommends approval.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University (BSU) is requesting approval of an online program fee for its recently -created undergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography. Approval of this the online fee will enable BSU to serve two different audiences with its new certificate: 1) Students enrolled at BSU who wish to add th is certificate to enhance their qualifications/credentials for thei r chosen programs of study , who will be able to include the certificate courses as part of their overall 120 credits towards degree , and will pay the traditional tuition and fees paid by BSU students ; 2) Individuals who are not enrolled in any other BSU pr ogram who will be able to will register for separate sections of the certificate courses that will be offered under the online program fee model. Design ethnography is an adaptation of one sub -discipline of anthropology for purposes of applied research, mainly in the areas of user experience research, design research, and qualitative research. Design ethnography employs the systematic observation and description of attitudes, behaviors and socia l relations for informing decision making in private, for -profit industry, public -sphere planning and service, and non -profit organizations. The certificate will provide marketable skills to graduates from a variety of majors, including anthropology, because it is both applicable and accessible to all fields that involve human relations, including business, engineering, psychology, sociology, design, and anthropology. A recent survey of LinkedIn job openings found over 5,000 jobs requiring \"qualitative research skills and over 20,000 jobs requiring \"research design skills.\" Currently, no other institution in Idaho offers an online or in-person undergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography. IMPACT The online mode of the certificate program will operate under the guidelines of Board Policy V.R as they pertain to wholly online programs. Th is policy enables the institution to set a price-point appropriate for the program; students will pay an online program fee in lieu of tuition. The price-point for the proposed online BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 2 program fee will be $497 per credit. The total cost of the 12 credits would be $5,964. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Undergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography Page 5 online program fee proposal STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS This request is for Board approval of an online fee structure for a new certificate program. The undergraduate certificate was processed through a notification letter to the Board office, in accordance with Board Policy III.G. This policy does not require submission and approval of a program proposal for academic certificates consisting of 30 credits or less. BSU's online fee request would be applicable only to students in Design Ethnography online course sections , and would not apply to BSU students who are simultaneously enrolled in other BSU programs. The Design Ethnography certificate program proposal has worked its way through the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) --which forwarded the proposal with a recommendation for approval on November 17, 2016; then to the Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) Committee on December 1, 2016; and to the Business Affairs and Human Resources (BAHR) committee on December 2, 2016. Board Policy V.R.3.a.x. states \" an online program fee may be charged for any fully online undergraduate, graduate, and certificate program. An online program fee shall be in lieu of resident or non-resident tuition (as defined in Idaho Code \u00a733-3717B) and all other Board-ap proved fees. An online program is one in which all courses are offered and delivered via distance learning modalities (e.g. campus-supported learning management system, videoconferencing, etc.); provided however, that limited on-campus meetings may be allowed if necessary for accreditation purposes or to ensure the program is pedagogically sound.\" Staff believes that the proposed online fee for Design Ethnography is consistent with the letter of Board policy. As with other market-based pricing approaches , time will tell if the on-line program mode and price level will be successful and sustainable. Staff recommends approval. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 3 BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Boise State University to designate an online program fee for the Boise State University u ndergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography in the amount of $497 per credit in conformance with the program budget submitted in Attachment 1.

Describe the request and give an overview of the changes that will result. Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Identify any existing program that this program will replace. Boise State University proposes the creation of a n online undergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography (DEC) . The new online Design Ethnography certificate will operate under the guidelines of the newly revised SBOE Policy V.R as the y pertain to wholly online programs , and it will consist of 12 credits of upp er division ethnography courses offered online (see Appendix A). The proposed, wholly-online undergraduate certificate will operate in parallel with the recently approved in-person, undergraduate certificate in Design Ethnography. The recently approved, in- person certificate will continue to be available to students on campus. Design ethnography employs the systematic observation and description of attitudes, behaviors and social relations for informing decision making in private, for-profit industry, public-sphere planning and service, and non-profit organizations. It is a dynamic application of anthropology that adapts ethnography for purposes of applied research, mainly in the areas of user experience research, design research, and qualitative research. 2. Need for the Program . Describe the student, regional, and statewide needs that will be addressed by this proposal and address the ways in which the proposed program will meet those needs. Despite growing demand for ethnographic insights, training in the field remains underdeveloped across the country. As a result, students graduating with anthropology degrees are entering the job market with a lack of marketable skills. The Design Ethnography Certificate will bring workforce relevance to anthropology students at Boise State, and will also help meet the broader national needs for professionally trained ethnographers. As a modular certificate, it is both applicable and accessible to all fields involving human relations, including business, engineering, psychology, sociology, design, and anthropology. All courses used for the certificate will have an experiential learning element and will be team taught by Boise State faculty, graduate students, and professional practitioners of design ethnography. The proposed program will provide practical training in methods and techniques, emphasizing direct hands-on experience in proposing, conducting, analyzing, and presenting ethnographic research in and for professional spheres. As a dynamic applied field, design ethnography offers unique opportunities and challenges for student-driven pedagogy, such as iterative research design. Course content will integrate dialogues and engagement with professional practitioners. The online format will allow Boise State University to reach potential students that live in communities that do not have access to in-person programs and/or are not able to attend face to face programs because of work and/or family responsibilities. Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G., Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance . This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program. All questions must be answered . ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 6a. Workforce need: Provide verification of state workforce needs that will be met by this program.

Organizational Ethnographer In fact, students who complete the proposed certificate can work in a wide variety of fields; therefore, labor data can only provide the roughest of estimates of workforce need. To provide that rough estimate, we use numbers from the following job groups: Market Research Analysts and Marketing Specialists (SOC 13-1161), Software Developers, Applications (SOC 15-1132), Social Scientists and Related Workers (SOC 19-30000), Designer, all other (SOC 27-1029).

Student need. What is the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full-time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Document student demand by providing information you have about student interest in the proposed program from inside and outside the institution. If a survey of s was used, please attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix A . In a demanding job market, recent college graduates need to be able to demonstrate the relevancy of their education to a future employer. The proposed program will provide students a marketable experiential education. Through course work that centers on field research in partnership with a company, non-profit, or public entity, students will gain true professional experience and will have access to professional networks. In addition, students will also have the opportunity to learn from professional practitioners who will be able to provide feedback and advice on future career options. c. Economic Need : Describe how the proposed program will act to stimulate the state economy by advancing the field, providing research results, etc. The ways in which society utilizes new technology continue to expand. In the face of that expansion, private, for-profit, public-sphere and non-profit organizations all strive to advance and update the ways in which they provide services for their \"consumers.\" To do so successfully requires an understanding of the consumer . That is, what is the consumer 's schedule like? Is the consumer a parent or spouse? How much does the consumer earn? Where does the consumer live? How old is the consumer? How much technology does the consumer use in a day? What language(s) does the consumer speak? These are just a few of the numerous questions that businesses, non-profits, and local, state, and federal governments try to answer when designing their services, or creating an experience for their consumers. As such, there is a great need for future employees with skills and experience producing insights into underlying social and cultural constraints that make products or services more or less successful . d. Societal Need Describe additional societal benefits and cultural benefits of the program. To be successful in meeting the vast array of societal need requires trained professionals that are equipped to gather the qualitative and contextual information to answer the \"why\" questions raised in professional environments. For example, why do so few people show up to take advantage of free lunch offered to children and their families over the school break? ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 8To answer such a question requires an understanding of who is targeted by the service, and an ability to discover other information about the target consumer. With that information, the service can be designed in such a way that increases the likelihood of consumers taking advantage of important public assistance or products offered in their community. Perhaps the solution was a simple one, such as, \"make the free lunch location easily accessible on public transit as most consumers of this service do not have reliable transportation.\" Public assistance and public health efforts are littered with unsuccessful programs and campaigns caused by a lack of contextual understanding of the consumer. The proposed online certificate will produce students who can help answer questions like the one above for future employers and their communities. e. If Associate's degree, transferability : N/A 3. Similar Programs. Identify similar programs offered within Idaho and in the region by other in- state or bordering state colleges/universities. Although the proposed certificate will share some concepts with programs in anthropology, sociology, psychology, and marketing, the certificate will be quite distinct in content from any of those. Therefore we are not listing anthropology programs that might, at first blush, seem similar to the proposed program (e.g., at UI, ISU, and LCSC). Similar Programs offered by other Idaho institutions and by institutions in nearby states Institution Name Degree name and Level Program Name and brief description if warranted 4. Justification for Duplication with another institution listed above. (if applicable). If the proposed program is similar to another program offered by an Idaho public institution, provide a rationale as to why any resulting duplication is a net benefit to the state and its citizens. Describe why it is not feasible for existing programs at other institutions to fulfill the need for the proposed program. Although all of the four year degree granting Idaho institutions offer degrees or focused study in Anthropology, none of the institutions offer a specialized certificate that incorporates ethnographical study and application to private, for-profit industry, public sphere planning and service, and non-profit organizations. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 95. Describe how this request supports the institution's vision and/or strategic plan. Goals of Institution Strategic Plan Proposed Program Plans to Achieve the Goal Goal 1: Create a signature, high -quality educational experience for all students Boise State's online program development process allowed us to create a cohesive, consistent, rigorous, and outcome -driven educational experience. The proposed certificate program help s students bridge the gaps between theory and practice. Goal 2: Facilitate the timely attainment of educational goals of our diverse student population The online delivery of this program will enable students with work, life, or other adult responsibilities to obtain a marketable undergraduate certificate . Goal 4: Al ign university program and activities with community needs The proposed certificate program is designed to meet the needs of private, for -profit industry, public sphere planning and service, and non - profit organizations in providing relevant and effective consumer services and products . 6. Assurance of Quality. Describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program. Describe the institutional process of program review. Where appropriate, describe applicable specialized accreditation and explain why you do or do not plan to seek accreditation. The following measures will ensure the high quality of the new program: Regional Institutional Accreditation: Boise State University is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Regional accreditation of the university has been continuous since initial accreditation was conferred in 1941. Boise State University is currently accredited at all degree levels (A, B, M, D). Program Review : Boise State has instituted a new program review procedure. At the inception of new programs, the programs will submit to the Office of the Provost a three-year assessment plan to be scheduled into the Periodic Review/Assessment Reporting Cycle. The plan includes program learning outcomes; and an implementation plan with a timeline identifying when and what will be assessed, how the programs will gather assessment data, and how the program will use that information to make improvements. Then, every three years, the programs will provide Program Assessment Reports (PAR), which will be reviewed by a small team of faculty and staff using a PAR Rubric, which includes feedback, next steps, and a follow-up report with a summary of actions. Program Development Support: The online DEC is one of several programs that are being created via the eCampus Initiative at Boise State University. Boise State's online program development process uses a facilitated 10-step program design process to assist program faculty members in the creation of an intentional, cohesive course progression with tightly aligned course and program outcomes. A multi-expert development team, which includes an instructional designer, multimedia specialist, graphic designer, and web designer, works collaboratively with the faculty member. One master version of each course is developed for ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 10consistent look and feel of courses across the program; the master course utilizes professional created common template aligned with nationally used Quality Matters course design standards. Student Authentication: Because the proposed certificate program will be offered entirely online, it is important to include mechanisms by which we authenticate the identity of students enrolled in the program. We will use the following mechanisms: During the admissions process, the university will confirm required official transcripts and other documentation required for admission into the program. During student orientation programs, academic integrity will be addressed. At the beginning of each course, the instructor will communicate expectations regarding academic integrity to students verbally and in the syllabus. Associated with access to and use of our Learning Management System, a secure log-in environment will be provided and students will be required to use strong student passwords and to change them every 90 days. During the design of the curriculum and assessment of each course, instructors will apply training and principles from the Quality Instruction Program of fered by Boise State's eCampus Center - which includes Quality Matters best practices and WCET's Best Practice Strategies to Promote Academic Integrity in Online Education (Version 2.0, June 2009). Faculty members will utilize Blackboard's Safe Assignment plagiarism detection program when appropriate. Faculty members are expected to be informed of and aware of the importance of academic integrity and student identity authentication, and to report and act upon suspected violations. 7. In accordance with Board Policy III.G., an external peer review is required for any new doctoral program. Attach the peer review report as Appendix B . N/A 8. Teacher Education/Certification Programs All Educator Preparation programs require review from the Professional Standards Commission (PSC) and approval from the Board. In addition to the proposal form, the Program Approval Matrix ( Appendix C ) is required for any new and modifications to teacher education/certification programs, including endorsements. The matrix must be submitted with the proposal to OSBE and SDE using the online academic program system as one document. N/A 9.

ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 1211. Program Intended Learning Outcomes and Connection to Curriculum. a. Intended Learning Outcomes. List the Intended Learning Outcomes for the proposed program, using learner-centered statements that indicate what will students know, be able to do, and value or appreciate as a result of completing the program. The certificate will focus on developing concrete skills: proposing a project, engaging in ethnography in varied contexts, analyzing findings, and presenting those findings. Intended Learning Outcomes for the proposed program: At the end of the Design Ethnography Certificate, students will be able to: Explain the power and place of ethnography in contributing to human-centered design processes and in generating key insights for organizational decision-making Apply ethnographic methods in diverse professional settings Collaborate as a team member in a discovery, design, and testing process in a real-world professional context Document proficiency in application of ethnographic methods in a multi-media portfolio of applied work including a professional profile in a prominent business social network Practice research on human subjects with the strongest ethical consideration, cultural sensitivity, and awareness of diverse cultural norms. 12. Assessment plans a. Assessment Process. Describe the assessment process that will be used to evaluate how well students are achieving the intended learning outcomes of the program. The program will use required student Portfolios to map student work ( Portfolio artifacts) to specific student learning outcomes. The Design Ethnography Assessment Committee will use a rubric to review a sampling of the artifacts to determine the degree to which student learning outcomes have been met and how curriculum mig ht be altered in the future to improve student learning . b. Closing the loop. How will you ensure that the assessment findings will be used to improve the program? Data will be share d with the Advisory Committee and actions will be developed to address concerns that are raised. c. Measures used. What direct and indirect measures will be used to assess student learning? Program a ssessment process described in Section 12a , that is, Portfolios t hat map student work (Portfolio artifacts) to specific student learning outcomes Faculty grades on specific assignments d. Timing and frequency . When will assessment activities occur and at what frequency? The program will use a three -year assessment cycle. Three student learning outcomes will be assessed yearly, which will provide two complete cycles of data collection every six years . ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 13Enrollments and Graduates 13. Existing similar programs at Idaho Public Institutions. Using the chart below, provide enrollments and numbers of graduates for similar existing programs at your institution and other Idaho public institutions. 14. Projections for proposed program: Using the chart below, provide projected enrollments and number of graduates for the proposed program: 15. Describe the methodology for determining enrollment and graduation projections. Refer to information provided in Question #2 \"Need\" above. What is the capacity for the program? Describe your recruitment efforts? How did you determine the projected numbers above? The program's size will be scaled to demand for the program. We believe that there is a substantial market, however the actual size of the program will depend largely on our ability to successfully market it. We surveyed LinkedIn job openings on June 3 and found 5,218 job s requiring \"qualitative research\" skills, 20 ,646 jobs requiring \"research design,\" skills, 249 jobs requiring \"ethnography\" Existing Similar Programs: Historical enrollments and graduate numbers Institution and Program Name Fall Headcount Enrollment in Program Number of Graduates From Program (Summer, Fall, Spring) FY12-13 FY13-14 FY14-15 FY15-16 (most recent) UI LCSC Proposed Program: Projected Enrollments and Graduates First Five Years Program Name: Online Design Ethnography Certificate Projected Fall Term Headcount Enrollment in Program Projected Annual Number of Graduates From Program FY17 (first 10 30 60 80 82 82 0 0 8 17 33 35 ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 14skills, 52,025 jobs requiring \"user experience (UX)\" research skills. The DEC certificate will introduce and foster the development of these skills in concert with professional practitioners. Projected numbers were based on small percentages of the jobs available with increasing projections based on increased marketing (once funds become available) and reputation of the program. 16. Minimum Enrollments and Graduates. Have you determined minimums that the program will need to meet in order to be continued? What are those minimums, what is the logical basis for those minimums, what is the time frame, and what is the action that would result? Enrollments in the program will need to be sufficient to maintain at least break even of revenue vs. expenses. Given the expenses listed for the fourth year, the program will need to generate at least 360 SCH to break even. Note that our projection for that year is 480 SCH. If enrollments are not sufficient to meet expenses as described herein, the program will be scaled back as feasible. However, if enrollments fall below the point at which we are able to offer a high quality program, the program will be discontinued. Resources Required for Implementation - fiscal impact and budget 17. Physical Resources. a. Existing resources . Describe equipment, space, laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other physical equipment presently available to support the successful implementation of the program. The available space and equipment is currently acceptable to operate a successful program . b. Impact of new program . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of physical resources by the proposed program? How will the increased use be accommodated? No impact. c. Needed resources. List equipment, space, laboratory instruments, etc., that must be obtained to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those physical resources into the budget sheet. None. 18. Library resources a. Existing resources and impact of new program . Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present program? Will there be an impact on existing programs of increased library usage caused by the proposed program? For off-campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. Library resources are sufficient . ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 15b. Needed resources . What new library resources will be required to ensure successful implementation of the program? Enter the costs of those library resources into the budget sheet. None. 19. Personnel resources a. Give an overview of the personnel resources that will be needed to implement the program. How many additional sections of existing courses will be needed? Referring to the list of new courses to be created, what instructional capacity will be needed to offer the necessary number of sections? b. Describe the existing instructional, support, and administrative resources that can be brought to bear to support the successful implementation of the program. c. List the new personnel that must be hired to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those personnel resources into the budget sheet. The proposed program will be offered using new instructional capacity that is funded by the fees generated by the program. That instructional capacity will consist of a combination of a lecturer, graduate assistants, and professional practitioners. We will scale the FTEs devoted to the program based on the demand for the program. d. Impact on existing programs . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of existing personnel resources by the proposed program? How will quality and productivity of existing programs be maintained? Because the resources devoted to the program will be funded wholly from the student fees generated by the program, we will be able to ensure that instructional capacity is scaled to meet student demand and that existing instructional program will be unaffected. 20. Revenue Sources a) Reallocation of funds: If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropriated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? There will be a shortfall, estimated at $13,920, during the first year of the program as it gets up and running. The College of Innovation and Design will provide the necessary funding as part of its efforts to facilitate the launch of new programs of an innovative nature. b) New appropriation . If an above Maintenance of Current Operations (MCO) appropriation is required to fund the program, indicate when the institution plans to include the program in the legislative budget request. N/A ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 16c) Non-ongoing sources : i. If the funding is to come from one-time sources such as a donation, indicate the sources of other funding. What are the institution's plans for sustaining the program when that funding ends? N/A ii. Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) that will be valid to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? N/A d) Student Fees : i. If the proposed program is intended to levy any institutional local fees, explain how doing so meets the requirements of Board Policy V.R., 3.b. The student fee will be in accordance with the Online Program Fee as defined in the Board Policy V.R., 3.a.x. That policy enables the institution to set a price-point appropriate for the program; students will pay an online program fee in lieu of tuition. The price-point for our online program fee will be set at $497 per credit. ii. Provide estimated cost to students and total revenue for self-support programs and for professional fees and other fees anticipated to be requested under Board Policy V.R., if applicable. For the 12 credits required for completion of the certificate, students will pay an online program fee of $497 per c redit. The total cost of those 12 credits would be $5,964. We project that by the fourth year of the prog ram, it will generate 480 SCH, which will yield a total revenue of $238,560. 21. Using the budget template provided by the Office of the State Board of Education, provide the following information: Indicate all resources needed including the planned FTE enrollment, projected revenues, and estimated expenditures for the first four fiscal years of the program. Include reallocation of existing personnel and resources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars. Amounts should reconcile subsequent pages where budget explanations are provided. If the program is contract related, explain the fiscal sources and the year- to-year commitment from the contracting agency(ies) or party(ies). Provide an explanation of the fiscal impact of any proposed discontinuance to include impacts to faculty (i.e., salary savings, re-assignments). ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 5 Page 17 I.

This property has now been identified as a preferred location for the Board-sponsored Cybercore facility project in collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). A deal has been negotiated with the original seller to lift the land use restriction s on the Foundation property. The arrangements to lift the land use restrictions include the transfer of a small section of Foundation-owned property to the sellers\u2014 this triangular half-acre parcel is contiguous to property already owned by the sellers, and, although it is in the same area as the intended Cybercore site, the half-acre parcel is not needed for the INL project (see map in Attachment 1). The Board holds an easement on the half-acre parcel. The ISU Foundation is requesting that the Board terminate its easement so the half-acre parcel of land can be transferred to the seller without the easement. ISU has no need for and derives no benefit from the easement held by the Board.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The University of Idaho (UI) is providing an updated Six-Year Capital Plan to reflect changes on two projects\u2014upgrade of the University's extension center in Salmon, Id aho; and construction of a multi-purpose arena adjacent to the Kibbie Activity Center on the Moscow, Idaho campus. The UI operates the Nancy M. Cummings Research, Extension, and Education Center in Salmon, Idaho. Research conducted there includes genetic improvement, reproduction, nutrition, irrigation, and environmental impact. Facilities at the site serve barn, shop, and storage needs , and include an aging classroom attached to the equipment shop with limited internet connection, and located far from the animals and main station. A long term goal has been to provide a classroom facility on site supporting greater connectivity to teaching on campus and better workshops for producers in keeping with the extension mission. The project is envisioned to include technology equipped classrooms, a large meeting space for gatherings, a small catering kitchen, outdoor learning spaces, and necessary restroom and mechanical support spaces, utility infrastructure, and site development. This is a project newly added to the six-year plan at this time. The UI has had a long term vision to construct a multi-purpose arena adjacent to the Kibbie Dome to serve a variety of campus events and activities in an appropriately sized 4,000 - 5,000 seat venue. The Idaho Arena will include a multi- use events floor and a practice court, as well as office, concessions, and conference space. This is an update to the six-year plan, reflecting greater detail for the line item included since the FY14 plan, previously cited as the Basketball Arena, and prior to that, the Events Pavilion. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 7 Page 2 IMPACT These two facilities are key to the success of the university's strategic plan, supporting Goal 2, Engage, and Goal 3, Transform, engaging the community and enriching the collegiate experiences and careers of the students of the UI.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The University of Idaho (UI) requests authorization to execute an educational association agreement to develop and implement the University of Idaho International Student Success Program. This will be a pathway program that will provide non-credit courses together with for-credit courses to international stude nts in an initial year. After successful completion of the ir first year at UI , students will be eligible to matriculate as full-time non-resident students. The U I sent out RFP Number 16-108M in May 2016 for Pathway Program for Recruiting International Students. Navitas North America (Navitas USA Holdings LLC) was the successful bidder. The parties have been negotiating the contract since August 2016 and are near a final agreement. This agreement will provide UI with an average annual revenue stream over the initial five year term of the contract of approximately $1.5 million per year, based on the projected number of students in the pathway program per year , which is projected to steadily grow, reaching approximately 1200 by year five. To the extent that the pathway students matriculate as full-time non-resident students, the UI also will realize the additional tuition revenue, less commission amounts to be paid to Navitas on a per student basis for the first year they are enrolled. Navitas will be responsible for the costs of providing the pathway program, UI is responsible for providing space on campus for the program. With this contract, UI will be able to take advantage of the international presence and outreach of Navitas, as well as benefit from its expertise in on-campus pathway programs. The initial focus of the program will be international students; however, the contract allows for expansion of the program. IMPACT This contract will provide UI with a program that will benefit the campus by increasing the number of overall international students and, by extension, increasing the opportunities for all students to expand their international knowledge and experience. It also will provide a revenue source while, at the same time, allowing UI to take advantage of the economies of scale and marketing benefits created by associating with an entity with expertise in delivering pathway programs and with a significant international footprint.

The desired end goal\u2014a balanced mix of international students at a level of approximately 1,200 students within the overall student population\u2014is indicative of the solid planning and preparation that has taken place. The proposed contract provides comprehensive support for all aspects of international student recruiting while generating positive annual net revenues to the university. Staff recommends approval.

BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 8 Page 72 EXHIBIT J Requirements for Premises 1. The Parties acknowledge that the provision of appropriate quality facilities for both instructional and administration purposes of the UI -ISSP is essential to successfully meeting the objectives of the UI -ISSP. This is because, amongst other things: (a) international students are paying on average three times the tuition fees of in -state domestic students; (b) m any come from world- class cities that have experienced tremendous development over the past two decades; (c) they have high expectations and spread their opinions and thoughts via socia l media for the world to read; (d) the quality of the physical environment reflects on the brand of the Parties and makes a statement about the University's and Navitas' aspirations, professionalism and commitment to the student experience ; and (e) most importantly, the quality of facilities is a key differentiator amongst the myriad of options available to international students in the U .S. 2. Since the UI-ISSP are the initial gateway into UCIC and the University , the Premises should provide an exciting, invigorating and socially engaging environment which is support ive of the Students' academic and extracurricular goals and objectives. The Premises should be a hive of activity, a place for students from around the world to gather and engage socially and allow Students to meet, stop and talk opportunistically, but also contain zones for quiet group work, self-study and areas to be interactive with faculty and support staff. It is important that there is a real sense of arrival into the reception area of the Premises, of it being an inspirational place, but it should also be support ive and welcoming. It should encourage a real sense of community 3. The Premises shall wherever possible be co -located or within proximity of existing international student programs or support services. The Premises should not be located f ar off-Campus or on the outer periphery of the Campus. This is because integration with domestic students and campus life from day one is essential to drive an outstanding student experience and deliver the cross -cultural benefits to both international and domestic students of the University . 4. The University shall be responsible for the services, maintenance and security of the Premises on the same basis as its other facilities on Campus. 5. Navitas shall comply with all reasonable directions of the University, the University Policies and Regulations and all applicable laws and regulations in response of its use of the Premises. Facilities requirements by phase Phase 1 Start- up: During the initial few months before the first intake of Students 6. During this period there will be a need for enough office space for the interim team that will be in place to begin building the infrastructure necessary for the beginning of operations. This team will consist of 6 people at the beginning, but will grow to approximately 10 leading up to the first intake. Phase 2 Transitional: Initial four years following Phase 1 with up to 500 Students 7. Prior to the arrival of the first inaugural cohort of Students, a central building/area on Campus needs to be identified to act as th e transitional hub or center for the operations of the UI-ISSP. BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 ATTACHMENT 2 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 8 Page 73This space should be able to accommodate the operation of the UI -ISSP as transitional facilities for approximately up to 4 years while the need for new or larger facilities is being evaluated. Ideally, the University would carry out any reasonable refurbishment required in order to present a quality student experience during the transitional phase of operation. This space should be a contiguous facility on the main Campus. The facility should be fresh, lively, contemporary and invigorating. The following represents an ideal scenario: (a) a countered -area with an accessible, open reception area for student services staff to provide support to Students; (b) administrative offices sufficient to provide office Navitas space for staff (8 to 10 staff in total with several private offices and a larger shared space); (c) 2 (or 3) classrooms nearby or within to run the Ancillary Courses of both the USP and GSP; (d) a private area for 1 -on-1 or small group tutorials; (e) a Student lounge/social area and learning commons sufficient to provide adequate space for many Students to actively engage socially, study, work on projects, etc; (f) a meeting room for staff to utilize for meetings; (g) a preparation room for instructors to get ready for classes, and provide a base in which instructors can interact with each other and Navitas staff; (h) equipment, including computing equipment of the general standard of sophistication available to the University's staff and students generally [ (note: furniture and computer equipment for Navitas' staff will be provided by Navitas)]; (i) audiovisual equipment as nor mally provided for the University 's classroom teaching; (j) where feasible, teaching software, providing student access to software essential for classroom teaching and staff access to relevant lecture notes and on -line material; (k) internet connectivity to all offices and classrooms within the space; (l) classrooms across campus, as available in the University timetable, to deliver the Courses eligible for Degree Credit within the UI -ISSP. 8. The table below demonstrates the space requirem ents for a program like the UI -ISSP with up to 500 students enrolled: Premises space requirements - 500 students Teaching and Student Space Type of Space Number Required Space/Size Requirement Classrooms 5(c) and ( l) 6 25 seat classroom Student reception space 5(a) 1 300 sq. ft.

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC) is requesting Board approval to proceed with plann ing and design for the Living and Learning Complex project . Currently, housing options for LCSC students are limited with 340 beds available for those wishing to stay on campus. Occupancy rates are near 100% with waiting lists at the beginning of each semester. With a growing student body, meeting the demand for housing, student services, and classrooms is a priority for the college. Specific campus needs that would be provided by the facility were identified to include: o Housing options for 155 students o Student Health Center o Student Counseling Center o Student Recreation Center o Two general purpose classrooms o Student individual & team study spaces o Coffee, beverage, & snack bar o Student testing center The design of the Living and Learning Complex will provide a modern residence hall that will attract new students to campus and provide student-centered services. Although the feasibility study attached assumes a location, the design team will be assigned the task to evaluate multiple possible locations and identify the best location to serve the campus community. IMPACT The total project is currently estimated at $17 million, including design and construction costs, appropriate and precautionary contingency allowances, and fixtures, furniture and equipment (FF &E) estimates. The immediate fiscal impact is the cost of the planning and design phase of the overall project ($1,400,000). BUSINESS AFFAIRS AND HUMAN RESOURCES DECEMBER 15, 2016 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 2 Funding for this project is to be provided through the use of institutional reserves and donated gifts. These funds will supplement money acquired through borrowing (bonding) with the debt service to be paid through student rental fees.

The majority attend classes at the picturesque Lewiston campus with others attending teaching facilities in Coeur d'Alene and a number of other outreach centers in northern Idaho. LCSC's Vision Statement includes, \"The College's one-mission, one-team approach prepares students from all walks of life to make the most of their individual potential contributing to the common good by fostering respect and close teamwork among all Idahoans. Sustaining a tradition that dates back to its founding as a teacher training college, LCSC continues to place a paramount emphasis on effective instruction- focusing on the quality of the teaching and learning environment for traditional and non-traditional academic classes, professional-technical education, and community instructional programs. As professed in the college's motto, \"Connecting Learning to Life,\" instruction fosters powerful links between classroom knowledge and theory and personal experience and application.\" This facility is envisioned to further LCSC's nurturing of student development in a campus living setting that enhances the school's commitment to excellence in teaching and learning. SCOPE OF STUDY The premise of this study was to identify a potentia l site and g enerally identify the needs and limitations to develop a new Living Learning Facility for Lewis-Clark State College. This document has been developed by the study team to be used to guide the planning of the proposed facility. It is expected to be a living document that will evolve over time. The final document was to include scope of work (conceptual design), potential cost, and potential schedule. IDENTIFIED NEED The need for this facility is clearly documented in LCSC's Strateg ic Plan, Presidential Guidance Initiative PG-50, and Campus Facilities Master Plan. A number of strategic planning goals have been identified in this facility that support enhancing teaching & learning, optimizing student enrollment & success, expanding collaborative relationships, and leveraging resources which maximize institutional efficiency. Growth at the Lewiston campus is expected to continue. PROGRAM GOALS The program goals for this study were identified early in the pro cess. The following is a listing of those goals: Goal 1: Support Strategic Plan & Campus Facilities Master plan Goal 2: Place facility on Normal Hill campus Goal 3: Tie to historic campus vernacular Goal 4: Minimize required infrastructure improvements Goal 5: Provide for future expansion Goal 6: Identify program needs (critical outcome) Goal 7: Identify anticipated costs (critical outcome) Goal 8: Identify anticipated schedule (critical outcome) ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 5LCSC LIVING LEARNING 3PROGRAMMED SPACES A mixed use facility for 155 student residents with campus sup p ort spaces including student health center, student counseling center, classrooms, study & collaboration spaces, and fitness facility has been programmed as a part of this study. The following is a summary of spaces per floor level: Level 1 (basement) Fitness Facility Level 2 (main floor) Student Health Center Student Counseling Center Two Classrooms Student Collaboration/Study Coffee Shop/Convenience Level 3 (51 residents) Student Living/Collaboration Level 4 (52 residents) Student Living/Collaboration Level 5 (52 residents) Student Living/Collaboration CONCEPTUAL D ESIGN The conceptual design of this study provides for a separation o f activities based on use and hours of operation. The lower level is a daylighted basement which includes a student fitness facility of approximately 6,800 SF. The main floor is 13,400 SF providing for student campus support. Included are two classrooms, student health center, student counseling center, student collaboration/study areas, and coffee shop (with convenience store). The upper three floors are also 13,400 SF each providing a variety of student residential living arrangements. The identified desired site location is at the heart of campus and totals approximately 60,400 SF on all five levels. The design is anticipated to tie to the campus vernacular through scale, materials, and transparency. POSSIBLE CO S TS/BUDGET Possible construction and project costs have been developed fo r the conceptual design. The project is expected to be administered by the Division of Public Works following established state requirements. The following is a summary of identified cost allowances for this project: Programmed Construction Costs- o Construction Costs $ 12,880,855 o Sales Tax & Contingencies $ 1,283,094 o Total Construction Costs $ 14,163,949 Programmed Project Costs- o Programmed Construction Costs $ 14,872,146 o Fees & Expenses $ 1,415,575 o Testing/Plan Review $ 67,000 o Project Support $ 100,000 o Technology & FF&E $ 1,058,600 o Moving Expenses $ 35,000 o Escalation & Contingency $ 965,157 o Total Project Costs S 18,513,479 POSSIBLE SCHEDULE An anticipated schedule has been developed with the LCSC identifyi ng the expected milestones required for design, approval, and construction of the Living Learning Complex. A following is a summary of those milestones: Funding & planning approval Oct 2016 - Dec 2016 A/E design team selection Jan 2016 - Feb 2017 Schematic & design develop Mar 2017 - Aug 2017 Construction documents Sep 2017 - Feb 2018 Construction period Mar 2018 - Jun 2019 Move-in period Jul 2019 - Aug 2019 Fall semester begins Aug 2019 ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 6LCSC LIVING LEARNING 4 PROCESS Since the establishment of Lewis-Clark State College 1893, enrollment a t the institution has increased from dozens to currently well over 3,000 students annually. \"Renowned for its picturesque campus and comfortable family atmosphere, the college seeks to preserve these learning-conductive qualities at is maintains, modernizes, and expands its facilities to meet the challenges and opportunities associated with the growing demand for its programs in the 21st Century.\" STRATEGIC PLAN This facility study is a direct response to LCSC's current Strateg ic Plan. An external key factor identified in the plan is a belief that growth is imperative for the institution. It is stated in the plan that the \"Idaho State Board of Education directed the higher education institutions under its supervision to increase the proportion and number of Idahoans with a college certificate or degree to 60% by 2020- essentially doubling output.\" This has caused the institution to identify a strategy to accomplish this directive. As a part of this effort, \"The Presidential Guidance Initiative PG-50 is a study being conducted by LCSC \"on possible strategies to add bed spaces. If projected trends warrant, it would be feasible to add new student housing by the end of the five-year strategic planning window and to convert some older housing units in the LCSC inventory to other uses, including office space\". It is expected that a Living Learning Complex would aid the college in meeting portions of all four of its strategic planning goals: Goal 1: Sustain & enhance excellence in teaching & learning Goal 2: Optimize student enrollment & promote student success Goal 3: Strengthen & expand collaborative relationships & partnerships Goal 4: Leverage resources to maximize institutional strength & efficiency CAMPUS FACILITIES MASTER PLAN In 2001 LCSC \"implemented an integrated planning, programming, bu dgeting, and assessment process through which administrators and stakeholders link plans and budgets, striving to attain continual improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency of instructional and support programs to carry out the College's assigned mission and core themes.\" The Campus Facilities Master Plan identifies that \"the most likely areas for acquisition of new space\" will include \"increased dormitory capacity (as a number of residential students at LCSC continues to grow as older housing units approach the limits of their useful life)...\" Long term planning goals identified in the six-year capital plan include the continued expansion of classroom and residence hall facilities. Additionally, facility related initiatives identified include, \"continue to enhance the living, learning, and working environment on campus\" and a project request to support the creation \"of a facility to host a Teaching and Learning Center capability.\" ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 7LCSC LIVING LEARNING 5 STUDY PROCESS The focus of this study was to specifically identify facility n e eds, scope, potential costs, and schedule for a Living Learning Complex which could be used to accurately align with a realistic funding plan meeting the masterplan needs of Lewis-Clark State College (LCSC). Castellaw Kom Architects (CKA) worked closely with senior LCSC administration, housing, and food service staff to develop this facility study. This team of individuals was assembled to provide specific knowledge and understanding of building needs and vision for the facility. Close interaction between the design team and LCSC staff occurred through interactive meetings over a number of months. Following the guidelines of the LCSC Strategic Plan and Campus Facility Master Plan, CKA closely examined needs associated with the existing campus, utilities, enrollment, and campus growth in developing this study. Specific facility needs and anticipated scope for the facility were refined over the course of the study to more accurately replicate what actual needs will be. The Living Learning Complex is envisioned to be a multi-use on campus facility addressing student needs for varied housing opportunities, health & counseling services, recreation, study, and learning. Specific campus needs that would be provided by the facility were processed in detail, identified, and cataloged with the design team. During this process seven specific areas of facility needs were identified. These areas include: Varies housing options for 155 students Student Health Center Student Counseling Center Student Recreation Center Two general classrooms Student individual & team study spaces Coffee, beverage, & snack bar These spaces were programmed with extensive input from the LCSC planning team identified for this facility. It was determined that the identified areas of need for this project are the most pressing needs of the campus in the near future as well. Numerous conceptual designs were developed with the final recommendation being narrowed to a single concept design meeting the programmatic needs of the institution. Additionally, multiple campus site locations were examined with it being determined that the chosen location would best meet LCSC Strategic Plan needs. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 8 LCSC LIVING LEARNING 6PROGRAM GOALS To ensure that the facility plan meets institution needs a number of planning goals were processed and developed with the LCSC facility team representatives. These goals were developed to provide a planning template of program expectations. GOAL 1- SUPPORT STRATEGIC PLAN & CAMPUS FACILITIES MASTERPLAN Th e need for a Living Learning Complex are identified in the bo th LCSC's Strategic Plan and Campus Facilities Masterplan as identified previously in this facility study under the Process Chapter. Following the recommendations of the Strategic Plan will ensure that this facility will meet the vision, mission, and strategic planning goals that the institution have identified as critical to meeting future challenges. The Campus Facilities Masterplan was developed in response to LCSC's Strategic Plan and is reviewed annually providing for an \"integrated strategic planning, programming, budgeting, and assessment process.\" Specific facilities masterplan areas of correlation to the strategic plan include: Objective 1D: Maximize direct faculty & student interactions inside & outside of the classroom Objective 1F: Provide for a safe, healthy, and positive environment for teaching & learning Objective 2B: Establish a Center for Teaching & Learning Objective 2C: Expand infrastructure intended to entice students to reside on campus GOAL 2- PLACE FACILITY ON NORMAL HILL CAMPUS Placing the Living Learning Complex on the Normal Hill campus w ill provide for maximum support of the strategic plan. Increasing the number of students living on campus will increase faculty interactions and provide for a campus living experience fully embedding students in a campus setting. Limited existing site locations exist on campus without procuring additional property or taking away from the limited parking on campus. After a close examination of locations to place the facility, the site located between Talkington Hall and the Student Union Building was identified a providing the most desirable location meeting masterplan goals. GOAL 3- TIE TO HISTORIC CAMPUS VERNACULAR The Living Learning Complex will be a major addition to the LCSC c ampus and should enhance the existing historic campus vernacular setting. Use of appropriate building materials, scale, appearance, and circulation paths should blend into the existing campus. Additionally, building placement should respect campus pedestrian circulation and existing buildings. Appropriate building appearance and placement will provide for a seamless addition to the campus vernacular. The anticipated site for construction of the Living Learning Complex is located in the heart of the Normal Hill campus making the tie to the existing campus context that much more important. GOAL 4- MINIMIZE REQUIRED INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS In order to keep site development costs to a minimum, it is impor tant the building placement take into account the existing infrastructure. Relocation and/or upgrade of existing utilities will add to construction costs. Careful planning early in the project will help to minimize costly infrastructure improvements. It is anticipated that the existing facility will not use the existing steam heat system that is located on campus. Recent new buildings on campus have not used this infrastructure and it is anticipated that this practice will be continued. GOAL 5- PROVIDE FOR FUTURE EXPANSION Since growth of enrollment at the Normal Hill campus is antici p ated to continue through the 5-year strategic plan period, it would be ideal if provisions for future expansion are provided as a part of the Living Learning Complex design. The existing site identified in this study would allow for future expansion of the building to the west if the existing International Programs/Daycare Building were demolished. This older building with limited square footage could be removed to make room for future expansion. During this study, moving the World War II era Farragut Navy Training Center building was examined as a possibility that might be considered in the future if expansion of the Living Learning Complex were desired in the future. If this were to take place at a future date, availability ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 9 LCSC LIVING LEARNING 7of building movers and adverse impact on existing trees/lands caping should be closely examined. GOAL 6- IDENTIFY PROGRAM NEEDS (Critical Outcome) Three critical outcomes of this study are identifyin g \"what, ho w much, and when.\" The identified program needs are required to answer the first critical outcome question- \"what\". During the course of this study, the following programmed spaces were identified for inclusion in the Living Learning Complex. See the Appendix for a complete breakdown of programmed spaces. Basement Level o Fitness Facility o Support Spaces o Circulation Main Level o Collaboration/Study Areas o Classrooms- Two o Student Counseling Center o Student Health Center o Convenience/Coffee o Support Spaces o Circulation Upper Three Levels- 155 total residents o Resident Director o Suites- Four Person o Rooms- Two Person o Rooms- Single o Collaboration Rooms o Living Lounges o Support Spaces o Circulation GOAL 7- IDENTIFY ANTICIPATED COSTS (Critical Outcome) Answering the second critical outcome question- \"how much\" provi des for the identification of potential costs that are to be anticipated. Possible costs identified elsewhere in this feasibility study include both estimated costs for construction and project cost allowances. The conceptual design included in the study has been used as the basis for the construction cost model that has been developed. Project costs are additional costs beyond bid day numbers such allowances as administrative, support, FFE (fixtures, furnishings, & equipment), moving, A/E fees, inflation, lending fees, testing, abatement, change orders, and project contingencies. These project costs should be closely examined, identified, amended, and budgeted as required. GOAL 8- IDENTIFY ANTICIPATED SCHEDULE (Critical Outcome) The thir d critical outcome question of this study- \"when\" is ad dressed through the identification of anticipated milestones. An anticipated project schedule has been included elsewhere in this study to help with the institution anticipate milestones time frames required to plan, construct, and occupy of the new facility. As the project moves forward, the schedule will need to be adjusted as the planning picture becomes clearer. Much of the outlined schedule is linear in progression and should be noted that if any milestone is missed or delayed, the entire schedule will need to be extended. See the Appendix for a complete breakdown of anticipated project schedule. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 10LCSC LIVING LEARNING 8 PROGRAMMED SPACES The follo w ing programmed spaces have been closely coordinated with LCSC administration and staff identifying facility needs based on LCSC strategic plan and masterplan vision. Future campus growth is anticipated at the Normal Hill campus which this facility is envisioned to support. The program needs for the Living Learning Complex fall into four general groupings: residential living, learning/collaboration, student support, and fitness.

Building codes that have been adopted by the State of Idaho at the time of building permit review will need to be the basis of project design. Type of construction, allowable building area, adjacent structures separation, fire sprinklers, fire flow, and exiting all appear to be issues that will require close examination as the project design is further developed. The following is a summary of code limitations identified at this time for future consideration: TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION It appears that Type II (noncombustible) or Type III (noncombus tible exterior walls & combustible construction allowed elsewhere) would allow for the code required area, stories, and height of the concept design. Occupancy separation should be closely examined as the design is further developed. ALLOWABLE BUILDING AREA The basic allowable area per floor is as follows: Occupancy Typ e IIB Type IIIB Stories R-2, Dorm = 16,000 SF 16,000 SF 4 B, Business = 23,000 SF 19,000 SF 3 A-3, Assembly = 9,500 SF 9,500 SF 2 The basic allowable floor area per floor appears to be greater than the conceptual design floor area. Additionally, basic allowable area and stories are allowed to be increased through the use of automatic fire sprinklers or/and frontage separation. SEPARATION BETWEEN BUILDINGS Building p lacement on site is required to follow the code minimu m distance between buildings based on occupancy and construction classification. A summary of exterior wall fire protection required for the R-1, B, and A-3 occupancies based on distance to assumed property line between buildings are as follows: Distance Type IIB Type IIIB < 10 FT = 1 HR 1 HR 10 FT to < 30 FT = 0 HR 1 HR 30 or greater = 0 HR 0 HR AUTOMATIC FIRE SPRINKLERS The use of an automatic fire sprinkler system (AFSS) is requi r ed for all the residential occupancies. An AFSS also has the advantage of allowing the basic allowable area per floor to be increased by 200% in a multistory building. EGRESS Providing two exit stairways from the basement and upper floor s appears to provide the required number of exits and exit width to handle the occupant loading of exit stairs. The conceptual design has taken into account and has also provided for the required remoteness of exits. ACCESSIBILITY IBC Chapter 11 and the Americans with Disabilities Accessible Gu idelines (ADA-AG) require that each of the occupancies provided in the building include accessible features (R-2, B, & A-3). The addition of an accessible elevator is an important inclusion as a building amenity to meet these requirements. The conceptual design included in the study has taken into account specific accessible requirements. FUTURE ADDITION(S) It appears that if Type IIB or Type IIIB construction is used to construct the building and fire sprinklers are installed that the existing building code would allow for additional building area to be added in the future. This would provide the college with future growth opportunities in the form of addition(s) to the building. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 12LCSC LIVING LEARNING 10 CONCEPTUAL DESIGN The concep tual design has been developed to be student centered and located at the heart of campus. It is college's intent to create a sense of place. They would like to see a welcoming environment that will beckon students to gather here. Interior and exterior spaces have been designed to flow between each other. The mixed use facility envisioned includes living and learning spaces that will serve the entire student population while providing a residential home for 155 students during the academic year. Our concept includes a design that will invite students into the building and through the facility. It is intended to have a campus feel infused with nature (stepped planters). Natural light will stream into the building. Interior activity will be on display through the building's transparency. PROJECT INFORMATION Zone: NHMU (Normal Hill Mixed Use Zone), State of Idaho property Anticipated Uses: Mixed Use, College Campus Parking; Existing Campus Parking Lots Loading, Refuse, & Recycling: Shared with Student Union Building Site Size: 26,400 SF approximately Building Size: Student Exercise Facility (Basement) 6,800 SF Student Services & Learning (Level One) 13,400 SF Student Living & Learning (Level Two) 13,400 SF Student Living & Learning (Level Three) 13,400 SF Student Living & Learning (Level Four) 13,400 SF Building Total: 60,400 SF SITE PLAN - HEART OF CAMPUS The conceptual site plan provides for an emphasis on the campus p edestrian. The building is located along the major north-south axis of the campus walkway. This location is intended to embed student residents into campus life. The central location will provide easy access to student health, exercise, and counseling services for the general student population. The site is located in an open area between the Student Union Building (SUB), Talkington Hall, and Expedition Hall. Careful as-builting and placement of the building will be required to minimize adverse impact to the old growth trees surrounding the perimeter of this site. Additionally, relocation of existing interpretative park elements is anticipated to be blended with the new building and walks. Creation of a strong east-west walk would provide better campus pedestrian flow. Parking for this facility will be provided by the parking lot located immediately to the west. Service of the building will be shared with the SUB by a short alley located to the south. Potential future expansion could take place to the west with the removal and/or relocation of Expedition Hall.

Student lounges provide for a relaxed setting for student interaction. Learning and collaboration are supported by varying sizes of group study spaces. Natural light is captured providing for a healthy living and learning environment with 51-52 students on each level (155 Total). ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 16LCSC LIVING LEARNING 14 EXTERIOR OF TIMELESS MATERIALS & TRANSPARENCY The exterior design and materials of the conceptual design pro vide for an aesthetically pleasing palate of timeless materials that complement LCSC's campus vernacular. Exterior design features that blend with existing historic elements would add to the historic fabric of campus. The City of Lewiston is in the process of adopting the Normal Hill Special Planning Area (NHSPA) which is a residential zone fulling surrounding campus with the intent of encouraging historic preservation through the use of an overlay zone. The school's commitment to the historic detailing is readily apparent where two of LCSC's most recent remodel projects have been Orchid Award winners being honored for excellence in historic preservation. Large glazed openings of clear transparent glass provide views of campus life inside and out. The exterior design places the building's interior activities on display; activity and excitement are projected to passer byes adding vibrancy to the campus. ATTACHMENT 1 BAHR - SECTION II TAB 9 Page 17LCSC LIVING LEARNING 15 POSSIBLE COSTS/BUDGET The succe s s of any development is founded on quality research, investigation, and development to fully understand applicable issues. This facility study and conceptual design is a step forward in identifying these issues. It is fully expected that adjustments in cost assumptions will need to be coordinated and refined as the design is further developed and actual financing is finalized. It is assumed that the project will be administered by the Division of Public Works (DPW) and their development procedures will need to be followed. Costs will need to be continually updated as more information is obtained, scope is refined, and the design is adjusted. CONSTRUCTION COSTS ANTICIPATED The construction costs included for this facility st udy are a su mmary of an itemized cost model that was developed for the conceptual design. As mentioned previously, the construction cost model will need to be updated at each design phase to monitor whether assumptions made are still valid with changing market conditions. See next page for programmed construction cost summary. TOTAL PROJECT COSTS ANTICIPATED Total project costs include allowances for costs that will be re quired for the entire project including assumed construction costs. Total project costs include additional expenditures beyond bid day costs including allowances for administrative, support, FFE (fixtures, furnishings, & equipment), moving, A/E fees, inflation, testing & commissioning, abatement, change orders, and project contingencies. These project costs should be closely examined, identified, amended, and budgeted as required. See next page for programmed project cost summary.

PROJECT SCHEDULE ANTICIPATED The optimal project schedule includes funding finali zation, Id a ho State Board of Education approval (planning & design) and Division of Public Works assignment and set up prior to January 2017. The identified schedule includes design team selection and negotiation in January and February. Schematic design is scheduled to begin in March with design development completed in August. A five month construction documents period appears to allow for project bidding February 2018. Building construction is currently estimated to take approximately 14-15 months with completion in June 2019. This anticipated schedule would allow the owner two months for building move-in and startup with occupancy occurring at the start of fall semester 2019.

REFERENCE June 2016 The State Board of Education (Board) considered and app roved a change in the LCSC 6-year Capital plan in conjunction with the approval for planning and design of Spalding Hall. Previous to that time, Spalding Hall had not been considered a major capital project, based on its originally-estimated construction cost. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies & Procedures, Section V.K. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION LCSC is requesting Board approval to add a new Career Technical Education (CTE ) Building to the Six Year Capital Plan. LCSC intends to partner with local industry and the local school district to develop and construct a new CTE building to provide training in technical vocations to meet the labor force needs of the region and provide collaborative programs with the new Lewiston High School. LCSC makes this request at this time in order to put together a funding plan that includes possible donations, Federal grant opportunities, institutional contributions and other State funds. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1- Current Board-approved Six Year Capital Plan Page 3 Attachment 2 - Revised Six-Year Capital Plan Page 4 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS Board approval of the requested update to the LCSC rolling 6-year capital improvement plan is a prerequisite for solicitation of donations for the project, as required by Board Policy V.K.2.b, which states that \" before any institution or agency under the governance of the Board solicits, accepts or commits a gift or grant in support of a specific major project, such project must first be included on the institution's or agency's Board-approved six-year plan .\" The revised six-year plan also moves the earlier-approved Living and Learning Complex project one year earlier (to FY2018), and eliminates the earlier-approved FY2020 auto repair/diesel mechanics project, which has been subsumed into the new $20M CTE building project. Staff recommends approval.

Content stand ards are adopted statewide and reviewed every six (6) years by teams of educator s and stakeholders. These standards pro vide a consistent foundational level of academic content needed to be successful at each grade level and to graduate from Idaho's public schools. Citing the need for further pub lic comments, the Idaho Legislat ure rejected the science standards in Spring 2016. The State Department of Educa tion (Department) began negotiated rule making in April 2016 which in cluded solicitation of public comment online and in regional face to face meetings statewide. Comments through the submission form were accepted f or 23 days between when the negotiated rulema king notice was posted on Apr il 6, 2016 to the end of the comment period on April 29, 2016. Over 400 comments were received with the majority being positive for revised Science s tandards (96%). All comments were posted online on the Department website. Following the comment period, t he science standards committee m et to consider all comments and make changes the committee felt were substantive and warranted. Spring of 2016, draft revised Science standards were developed and finalized in June 2016, but the standards were not sent to the Board in August STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 2 with the other revised content standards to allow for additional deliberation on possible revisions. The sixteen (16) member scienc e standards committee of educator s and stakeholders, comprised of new as well as previously serving me mbers, as listed in attachment 3, reconvened in October 2016 to address and furt her consider public comment and to reformat the Science standards document. The changes brought forth by the committee reflect their belief that these changes should be incorporated into the standards. The science standards attached are a revised set of standards a nd are a different version than what t he board adopted in August 2015. D ifferences between the two revisions include substantial revisions of stru cture and organization, including eliminat ing correlations to Idaho Conte nt Standards in Mathematics and English Language Ar ts and Literacy, as well as other correlations to engineering pr actices. In addition, the committ ee made revisions to the standards to accommodate and answer concerns of stakehol ders and legislators centered on how idea s describing impacts on the ear th and age of the Earth are expressed. IMPACT These changes to the proposed standards will have no discernibl e financial impact.

To qualify as a te mporary rule, the rule must meet one of three criter ia: provides protection of the public health, safety, or welfare; or is to come into compliance with deadline s in amendments to governing law or federal program s; or is conferring a benefit. Temporary rules that are approved prior to the st art of a legislative session n ormally expire at the end of that legislative session. W hile not typical, there are provisions that allow an agency to present a temporary rule that has been approved prior to the start of a legislative session to the Legislature and to request they extend the rule one year. If the Legislature grants the extension the rule would t hen expire at the end of the following legislation. To make a temporary rule permane nt the Board will have to promulgate a proposed and then pending rule incorporati ng the new science standards during the 2017 rulemaking cycle. If the temporary rule is extended by the 2017 Legislature a new temporary rule will not have to STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 3 promulgate a new temporary rule at that same time in order to k eep the standards in place in 2017. Idaho's science content standards were last updated in 2009. D uring the 2015 rulemaking cycle new science st andards were adopted by the Boar d and incorporated by reference into Administrative Code. When the r ules and incorporated science standards w ere presented during the 2016 l egislative session both the Senate and House Education Committee members e xpressed concern that the public may not have had enough opportunity to provide feedback to the new standards. The standards were rejected by the Legislature to provide for additional comment and vetting. If approved by the Board, staff could ask the Legislature to e xtend the rule for another year.

(4-7-11) STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 6 THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK Idaho Science Standards White Paper Science Standards Recommendation We, the Executive Committee on the Idaho Science Standards Revision, recommend that the Idaho State Department of Education adopt the Idaho State Science Standards. Idaho has a long tradition of local ownership of our educational process and the revised science standards have been created by Idaho's K- 16 educators for use in Idaho's science classrooms. What is Science? Science is the coordination of a body of knowledge about the natural world and a set of practices that enable humans to explore and understand that world. Science is truly the original human endeavor. Natur al explanations for observed phenomena must be based on empirical evidence. What are the weak nesses of our current science standards? Science standards are currently in place for K-12 classrooms in Idaho. These standards are very broad and vag ue in nature. National and local evaluations of these current standards indicate a lack of clarity in science content topics. This makes it very difficult to assess student achievement of these standards beca use there are not clear performance expectations embedded in them. Inquiry-based learning methods are a best-practice in the field of science education yet they are missing from the Idaho Science document. Another valid criticism of the current science document that that it fails to adequately link math and English Lan guage Arts practices to key scientific applications. Standards should contain a planned scope and sequence of practices and content themes that spirals from kindergarten all the way through to high school and yet the current standards are compartmentalized and full of gaps. Why do we n eed to revise our science standards? Science as a practice is dynamic in nature. Our current science standards document was originally adop ted in 2001 with few significant changes in the interim. In the last fifteen years, there have been significant advancements in science and technology; therefore updated science standards are necessary. Science classrooms offer a unique opportunity for students to practice 21st century learning skills tha t will enable them to be more productive in their future endeavors. When comparing our current science standards with the revised science standards, it becomes clear that the document does not contain new content but is instead driven by a new approach to teaching that content. Revising I daho's science standards allows for the integration of \"knowing science\" and \"doing science\". Conceptual understanding of content will require practicing science in place of memorizing facts. S tructuring science standards around performance expectations makes mastery assessment of student knowledge an embedded component of science education. Updated science standards in this state will allow for learning experiences that will increase both content knowledge as well as scientific and engineering practices over time. This will eliminate the gaps and compartmentalization that is endemic in the c urrent document. National movement towards an updated version of science standards that is similar to Idaho's revised science standards document is dictating that professional development opportunities and curricular materials that are in development will align better with the revised document than with the current standards. Many of Idaho's post-secondary institutions are already using a version of science standards simila r to the revised Idaho Science Standards document in their science and their science education departments to train potential graduates in these fields. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 7Our science standards are strengthened when we teach science with a Three-Dimensional approach. Teaching three dimensionally means incorporating science content with crosscutting concepts and science and engineering practices.

Content Limit: Assessment does not include causes of seasons. Supporting Content ESS1.A: The Universe and its Stars The sun is a star that appears larger and brighter than other stars because it is closer. Stars range greatly in their distance from Earth. (ESS1 -5-1) ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System The orbits of Earth around the sun and of the moon around Earth, together with the rotation of Earth about an axis between its North and South poles, cause observable patterns.

Develop a model that predicts and describes changes in particle motion, temperature, and state of a pure substance when thermal energy is added or removed. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on qualitative molecular -level models of solids, liquids, and gases to show that adding or removing thermal energy increases or decreases kinetic energy of the particles until a change of state occurs. Examples of models could include drawings and diagrams. Examples of particles could include molecules or inert atoms. Examples of pure substances could include water, carbon dioxide, and helium. PS1-MS- 5. Develop and use a model to describe how the total number of atoms does not change in a chemical reaction and thus mass is conserved.

Examples of designs could involve chemical reactions such as dissolving ammonium chloride or calcium chloride. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to the criteria of amount, time, and temperature of substance in testing the device. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 85Page | 34 Supporting Content PS1.A Structure and Properties of Matter Substances are made from different types of atoms, which combine with one another in various ways. Atoms form molecules that range in size from two to thousands of atoms. (PS1-MS-1) Each pure substance has characteristic physical and chemical properties (for any bulk quantity under given conditions) that can be used to identify it. (PS1-MS-2, PS1-MS- 3) Gases and liquids are made of molecules or inert atoms that are moving about relative to each other. (PS1-MS-4) In a liquid, the molecules are constantly in contact with others; in a gas, they are widely spaced except when they happen to collide. In a solid, atoms are closely spaced and may vibrate in position but do not change relative locations. (PS1-MS- 4) Solids may be formed from molecules, or they may be extended structures with repeating subunits (e.q., crystals). (PS1-MS-1) The changes of state that occur with variations in temperature or pressure can be described and predicted using these models of matter. (PS1-MS-4) PS1.B Chemical Reactions Substances react chemically in characteristic ways. In a chemical process, the atoms that make up the original substances are regrouped into different molecules, and these new substances have different properties from those of the reactants. (PS1-MS-1, PS1-MS-3, PS1-MS-5) The total number of each type of atom is conserved, and thus the mass does not change. (PS1-MS-5) Some chemical reactions release energy, others store energy. (PS1-MS-6) PS3A: Definitions of Energy The term \"heat\" as used in everyday language refers both to thermal energy (the motion of atoms or molecules with in a substance) and the transfer of that thermal energy from one object to another. In science, heat is used only for this second meaning; it refers to the energy transferred due to the temperature difference between two objects. (PS1-MS-4) The temperature of a system is proportional to the average internal kinetic energy and potential energy per atom or molecule (whichever is the appropriate building block for the system's material). The details of that relationship depend on the type of atom or molecule and the interactions among the atoms in the material. Temperature is not a direct measure of a system's total thermal energy. The total thermal energy (sometimes called total internal energy) of a system depends jointly on the temperature, the total number of atoms in the system, and the state of the material. (PS1-MS-6) ETS1.B Developing Possible Solutions A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of the test results in order to improve it. (PS1-MS-6) The iterative process of testing the most promising solutions and modifying what is proposed on the basis of the test results leads to greater refinement and ultimately to an optimal solution. (PS1-MS-6) PS2-MS Motion and Stability: Forces and Interactions Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: PS2-MS- 1. Apply Newton's Third Law to design a solution to a problem involving the motion of two colliding objects. Further Explanation: Examples of practical problems could include the impact of collisions between two cars, between a car and stationary objects, and between a meteor and a space vehicle.

Plan an investigation to provide evidence that the change in an object's motion depends on the sum of the forces on the object and the mass of the object. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on balanced (Newton's First Law) and unbalanced forces in a system, qualitative comparisons of forces, mass and changes in motion (Newton's Second Law), frame of reference, and specification of units. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to forces and changes in motion in one-dimension in an inertial reference frame and to change in one variable at a time. Assessment does not include the use of trigonometry. PS2-MS- 3. Ask questions about data to determine the factors that affect the strength of electric and magnetic forces. Further Explanation: Examples of devices that use electric and magnetic forces could include electromagnets, electric motors, or generators. Examples of data could include the effect of the number of turns of wire on the strength of an electromagnet, or the effect of increasing the number or strength of magnets on the speed of an electric motor. Content Limit: Assessment about questions that require quantitative answers is limited to proportional reasoning and algebraic thinking. PS2-MS- 4. Construct and present arguments using evidence to support the claim that gravitational interactions are attractive and depend on the masses of interacting objects. Further Explanation: Examples of evidence for arguments could include data generated from simulations or digital tools; and charts displaying mass, strength of interaction, distance from the Sun, and orbital periods of objects within the solar system. Content Limit: Assessment does not include Newton's Law of Gravitation or Kepler's Laws. PS2-MS- 5. Conduct an investigation and evaluate the experimental design to provide evidence that fields exist between objects exerting forces on each other even though the objects are not in contact. Further Explanation: Exam ples of this phenomenon could include the interactions of magnets, electrically -charged strips of tape, and electrically -charged pith balls. Examples of investigations could include first-hand experiences or simulations. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to electric and magnetic fields, and limited to qualitative evidence for the existence of fields. Supporting Content PS2.A: Forces and Motion For any pair of interacting objects, the force exerted by the first object on the second object is equal in strength to the force that the second object exerts on the first, but in the opposite direction (Newton's third law). (PS2-MS-1) The motion of an object is determined by the sum of the forces acting on it; if the total force on the object is not zero, its motion will change. The greater the mass of the object, the greater the force needed to achieve the same change in motion. For any given object, a larger force causes a larger change in motion. (PS2-MS-2) All positions of objects and the directions of forces and motions must be described in an arbitrarily chosen reference frame and arbitrarily chosen units of size. In order to share information with other people, these choices must also be shared. (PS2-MS-2) PS2.B: Types of Interactions Electric and magnetic (electromagnetic) forces can be attractive or repulsive, and their sizes depend on the magnitudes of the charges, currents, or magnetic strengths involved and on the distances between the interacting objects. (PS2-MS-3) Gravitational forces are always attractive. There is a gravitational force between any two masses, but it is very small except when one or both of the objects have large mass\u2014e.g., Earth and the sun. (PS2-MS-4) Forces that act at a distance (electric, magnetic, and gravitational) can be explained by fields that extend through space and can be mapped by their effect on a test object (a charged object, or a ball, respectively).

Construct and interpret graphical displays of data to describe the relationships of kinetic energy to the mass of an object and to the speed of an object. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on descriptive relationships between kinetic energy and mass separately from kinetic energy and speed. Examples could include riding a bicycle at different speeds, rolling different sizes of rocks downhill, and getting hit by a wiffle ball versus a tennis ball. PS3-MS- 2. Develop a model to describe that when the arrangement of objects interacting at a distance changes, different amounts of potential energy are stored in the system. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on relative amounts of potential energy, not on calculations of potential energy. Examples of objects within systems interacting at varying distances could include: the Earth and either a roller coaster cart at varying positions on a hill or objects at varying heights on shelves, changing the direction/orientation of a magnet, and a balloon with static electrical charge being brought closer to a classmate's hair. Examples of models could include representations, diagrams, pictures, and written descriptions of systems. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to two objects and electric, magnetic, and gravitational interactions. PS3-MS- 3. Apply scientific principles to design, construct, and test a device that either minimizes or maximizes thermal energy transfer. Further Explanation: Examples of devices could include an insulated box, a solar cooker, and a Styrofoam cup. Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred. PS3-MS- 4. Plan an investigation to determine the relationships among the energy transferred, the type of matter, the mass, and the change in the average kinetic energy of the particles as measured by the temperature of the sample. Further Explanation: Examples of experiments could include comparing final water temperatures after different masses of ice melted in the same volume of water with the same initial temperature, the temperature change of samples of different materials with the same mass as they cool or heat in the environment, or the same material with different masses when a specific amount of energy is added. Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculating the total amount of thermal energy transferred. PS3-MS- 5. Construct, use, and present arguments to support the claim that when the kinetic energy of an object changes, energy is transferred to or from the object. Further Explanation: Examples of empirical evidence used in arguments could include an inventory or other representation of the energy before and after the transfer in the form of temperature changes or motion of object. Content Limit: Assessment does not include calculations of energy. Supporting Content PS3.A: Definitions of Energy Motion energy is properly called kinetic energy; it is proportional to the mass of the moving object and grows with the square of its speed. (PS3-MS-1) A system of objects may also contain stored (potential) energy, depending on their relative positions. (PS3-MS-2) Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles of matter. The relationship between the temperature and the total energy of a system depends on the types, states, and amounts of matter present. (PS3-MS-3, PS3-MS-4) PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer When the motion energy of an object changes, there is inevitably some other change in energy at the same time. (PS3-MS-5) The amount of energy transfer needed to change the temperature of a matter sample by a given amount depends on the nature of the matter, the size of the sample, and the environment.

Integrate qualitative scientific and technical information to support the claim that digitized signals are a more reliable way to encode and transmit information than analog signals. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on a basic understanding that waves can be used for communication purposes. Examples could include using fiber optic cable to transmit light pulses, radio wave pulses in WIFI devices, and conversion of stored binary patterns to make sound or text on a computer screen. Content Limit: Assessment does not include binary counting. Assessment does not include the specific mechanism of any given device. Supporting Content PS4.A: Wave Properties A simple wave has a repeating pattern with a specific wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. (PS4-MS-1) A sound wave needs a medium through which it is transmitted. (PS4-MS-2) PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation When light shines on an object, it is reflected, absorbed, or transmitted through the object, depending on the object's material and the frequency (color ) of the light. (PS4- MS-2) The path that light travels can be traced as straight lines, except at surfaces between different transparent materials (e.g., air and water, air and glass) where the light path bends. (PS4-MS-2) A wave model of light is useful for explaining brightness, color, and the frequency -dependent bending of light at a surface between media. (PS4-MS-2) However, because light can travel through space, it cannot be a matter wave, like sound or water waves. (PS4-MS-2) Energy is spontaneously transferred out of hotter regions or objects and into colder ones. (PS3 -MS-3) PS3.C: Relationship Between Energy and Forces When two objects interact, each one exerts a force on the other that can cause energy to be transferred to or from the object. (PS3-MS-2) ETS1.A: Defining and Delimiting an Engineering Problem The more precisely a design task's criteria and constraints can be defined, the more likely it is that the designed solution will be successful. Specification of constraints includes consideration of scientific principles and other relevant knowledge that is likely to limit possible solutions. (PS3-MS-3) ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions A solution needs to be tested, and then modified on the basis of the test results in order to improve it. There are systematic processes for evaluating solutions with respect to how well they meet criteria and constraints of a problem.

Content Limit: Assessment does not include details of the chemical reactions for photosynthesis or respiration. Supporting Content LS1.A: Structure and Function All living things are made up of cells, which is the smallest unit that can be said to be alive. An organism may consist of one single cell (unicellular) or many different numbers and types of cells (multicellular). (LS1-MS-1) Within cells, special structures are responsible for particular functions, and the cell membrane forms the boundary that controls what enters and leaves the cell. (LS1-MS-2) In multicellular organisms, the body is a system of multiple interacting subsystems. These subsystems are groups of cells that work together to form tissues and organs STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 91Page | 40 LS2-MS Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: LS2-MS- 1.

LS2-MS- 2. Construct an explanation that predicts patterns of interactions among organisms across multiple ecosystems.

(LS1 -MS-3) LS1.B: Characteristics of Living Things Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic information to their offspring. (LS1-MS-4) Living things share certain characteristics. (These include response to environment, reproduction, energy use, growth and development, life cycles, made of cells, etc.) (LS1-MS-4) LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms Plants, algae (including phytoplankton), and many microorganisms use the energy from light to make sugars (food) from carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and water through the process of photosynthesis, which also releases oxygen.

Further Explanation: Examples of ecosystem services could include water purification, nutrient recycling, and prevention of soil erosion. Examples of design solution constraints could include scientific, economic, and social considerations. Supporting Content LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems Organisms, and populations of organisms, are dependent on their environmental interactions both with other living things and with nonliving factors. (LS2-MS-1) In any ecosystem, organisms and populations with similar requirements for food, water, oxygen, or other resources may compete with each other for limited resources, access to which consequently constrains their growth and reproduction. (LS2-MS-1) Growth of organisms and population increases are limited by access to resources. (LS2-MS-1) Similarly, predatory interactions may reduce the number of organisms or eliminate whole populations of organisms. Mutually beneficial interactions, in contrast, may become so interdependent that each organism requires the other for survival. Although the species involved in these competitive, predatory, and mutually beneficial interactions vary across ecosystems, the patterns of interactions of organisms with their environments, both living and nonliving, are shared. (LS2-MS-2) LS2.B: Cycle of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems Food webs are models that demonstrate how matter and energy is transferred between producers, consumers, and decomposers as the three groups interact within an ecosystem. Transfers of matter into and out of the physical environment occur at every level. Decomposers recycle nutrients from dead plant or animal matter back to the soil in terrestrial environments or to the water in aquatic environments. The atoms that make up the organisms in an ecosystem are cycled repeatedly between the living and nonliving parts of the ecosystem. (LS2-MS-3) Food webs can be broken down into multiple energy pyramids. Concepts should include the 10% rule of energy and biomass transfer between trophic levels and the environment. (LS2-MS-4) LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience Ecosystems are dynamic in nature; their characteristics can vary over time. Disruptions to any physical or biological component of an ecosystem can lead to shifts in all its populations. (LS2-MS-5) Biodiversity describes the variety of species found in Earth's terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems. The completeness or integrity of an ecosystem's biodiversity is often used as a measure of its health. (LS2-MS-6) LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans Changes in biodiversity can influence humans' resources, such as food, energy, and medicines, as well as ecosystem services that humans rely on\u2014for example, water purification and recycling.

Develop and use a model to describe why mutations may result in harmful, beneficial, or neutral effects to the structure and function of the organism. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on conceptual understanding that changes in genetic material may result in making different proteins. Content Limit: Assessment does not include specific changes at the molecular level, mechanisms for protein synthesis, or specific types of mutations. LS3-MS- 2. Develop and use a model to describe why asexual reproduction results in offspring with identical genetic information and sexual reproduction results in offspring with genetic variation. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using models such as Punnett squares, diagrams, and simulations to describe the cause and effect relationship of gene transmission from parent(s) to offspring and resulting genetic variation. Supporting Content LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms Organisms reproduce, either sexually or asexually, and transfer their genetic information to their offspring. (LS3-MS-2) LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits Genes are located in the chromosomes of cells, with each chromosome pair containing two variants of each of many distinct genes. Each distinct gene chiefly controls the production of specific proteins, which in turn affects the traits of the individual. Changes (mutations) to genes can result in changes to proteins, which can affect the structures and functions of the organism and thereby change traits. (LS3-MS-1) Variations of inherited traits between parent and offspring arise from genetic differences that result from the subset of chromosomes (and therefore genes) inherited. (LS3-MS-2) LS3.B: Variation of Traits In sexually reproducing organisms, each parent contributes half of the genes acquired (at random) by the offspring. Individuals have two of each chromosome and hence two alleles of each gene, one acquired from each parent. These versions may be identical or may differ from each other. (LS3-MS-2) In addition to variations that arise from sexual reproduction, genetic information can be altered because of mutations. Though rare, mutations may result in changes to the structure and function of proteins. Some changes are beneficial, others harmful, and some neutral to the organism.

Analyze and interpret data for patterns in the fossil record that document the existence, diversity, extinction, and change of life forms throughout the history of life on Earth under the assumption that natural laws operate today as in the past.

Analyze displays of pictorial data to compare patterns of similarities in the anatomical structures across multiple species of similar classification levels to identify relationships. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on inferring general patterns of relatedness among structures of different organisms by comparing the appearance of diagrams or pictures. Content Limit: Assessment of comparisons is limited to gross appearance of anatomical structures within genus and species levels. No memorization of classification levels is required. LS4-MS- 4. Construct an explanation based on evidence that describes how genetic variations of traits in a population increase some individuals' probability of surviving and reproducing in a specific environment. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using concepts of natural selection like overproduction of offspring, passage of time, variation in a population, selection of favorable traits, and heritability of traits. LS4-MS- 5. Gather and synthesize information about the technologies that have changed the way humans influence the inheritance of desired traits in organisms. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on synthesizing information from reliable sources about the influence of humans on genetic outcomes in artificial selection (such as genetic modification, animal husbandry, gene therapy); and, on the impacts these technologies have on society as well as the technologies leading to these scientific discoveries. LS4-MS- 6. Use mathematical representations to support explanations of how natural selection may lead to increases and decreases of specific traits in populations over time. Further Explan ation: Emphasis is on using mathematical models, probability statements, and proportional reasoning to support explanations of trends in changes to populations over time. Examples could include Peppered moth population changes before and after the industrial revolution. Content Limit: Assessment does not include Hardy Weinberg calculations. Supporting Content LS4.A: Classification of Organisms The collection of fossils and their placement in chronological order is known as the fossil record and documents the change of many life forms throughout the history of the Earth. Anatomical similarities and differences between various organisms living today and between them and organisms in the fossil record enable the classification of living things. (LS4-MS-1, LS4-MS-2) Scientific genus and species level names indicate a degree of relationship. (LS4-MS-3) LS4.B: Natural Selection Natural selection leads to the predominance of certain traits in a population, and the suppression of others. (LS4-MS-4) In artificial selection, humans have the capacity to influence certain characteristics of organisms by selective breeding. One can choose desired parental traits determined by genes, which are then passed on to offspring. (LS4-MS-5) LS4.C: Adaptation Adaptation by natural selection acting over generations is one important process by which species change over time in response to changes in environmental conditions. Traits that support successful survival and reproduction in the new environment become more common; those that do not become less common. Thus, the distribution of traits in a population changes.

Further Explanation: Examples of models can be physical, graphical, or conceptual. ESS1 -MS- 2. Develop and use a model to describe the role of gravity in the motions within galaxies and the solar system. Further Explanation: Emphasis for the model is on gravity as the force that holds together the solar system and Milky Way galaxy and controls orbital motions within them. Examples of models can be physical (such as the analogy of distance along a football field or computer visualizations of elliptical orbits) or conceptual (such as mathematical proportions relative to the size of familiar objects such as students' school or state).

Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence from rock strata for how the geologic time scale is used to organize Earth's history. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how analyses of rock formations and the fossils they contain are used to establish relative ages of major events in Earth's history. Examples of Earth's major events could range from being very recent (such as the last Ice Age or the earliest fossils of homo sapiens) to very old (such as the formation of Earth or the earliest evidence of life). Examples can include the formation of mountain chains and ocean basins, the evolution or extinction of particular living organisms, or large volcanic eruptions. Content Limit: Assessment does not include recalling the names of specific periods or epochs and events within them. Supporting Content ESS1.A: The Universe and Its Stars Patterns of the apparent motion of the sun, the moon, and stars in the sky can be observed, described, predicted, and explained with models. (ESS1 -MS-1) Earth and its solar system are part of the Milky Way galaxy, which is one of many galaxies in the universe. (ESS1 -MS-2) ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System The solar system consists of the sun and a collection of objects, including planets, their moons, and asteroids that are held in orbit around the sun by its gravitational pull on them. (ESS1 -MS-2, ESS1-MS-3) This model of the solar system can explain eclipses of the sun and the moon. Earth's spin axis is fixed in direction over the short-term but tilted relative to its orbit around the sun. The seasons are a result of that tilt and are caused by the differential intensity of sunlight on different areas of Earth across the year. (ESS1 -MS-1) The solar system appears to have formed from a disk of dust and gas, drawn together by gravity.

Construct an explanation based on evidence for how geoscience processes have changed Earth's surface at varying time and spatial scales. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how processes change Earth's surface at time and spatial scales that can be large (such as slow plate motion s or the uplift of large mountain ranges) or small (such as rapid landslides or microscopic geochemical reactions), and how many geoscience processes (such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and meteor impacts) usually behave gradually but are punctuated by catastrophic events. Examples of geoscience processes include surface weathering and deposition by the movements of water, ice, and wind. Emphasis is on geoscience processes that shape local geographic features, where appropriate. ESS2 -MS- 3. Analyze and interpret data on the distribution of fossils and rocks, continental shapes, and seafloor structures to provide evidence of the past plate motions.

Content Limit: A quantitative understanding of the latent heats of vaporization and fusion is not assessed. ESS2 -MS- 5. Collect data to provide evidence for how the motions and complex interactions of air masses results in changes in weather conditions. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how air masses flow from regions of high pressure to low pressure, causing weather (defined by temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation, and wind) at a fixed location to change over time, and how sudden changes in weather can result when different air masses collide. Emphasis is on how weather can be predicted within probabilistic ranges. Examples of data can be provided to students (such as weather maps, diagrams, and visualizations) or obtained through laboratory experiments (such as with condensation). Content Limit: Assessment does not include recalling the names of cloud types or weather symbols used on weather maps or the reported diagrams from weather stations. ESS2 -MS- 6. Develop and use a model to describe how unequal heating and rotation of the Earth cause patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation that determine regional climates. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how patterns vary by latitude, altitude, and geographic land distribution. Emphasis of atmospheric circulation is on the sunlight - driven latitudinal banding, the Coriolis effect, and resulting prevailing winds; emphasis of ocean circulation is on the transfer of heat by the global ocean convection The geologic time scale interpreted from rock strata provides a way to organize Earth's history. Analyses of rock strata and the fossil record provide only relative dates, not an absolute scale.

Examples of models can be diagrams, maps and globes, or digital representations. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the dynamics of the Coriolis effect. Supporting Content ESS1.C: The History of Planet Earth Tectonic processes continually generate new ocean sea floor at ridges and destroy old sea floor at trenches. (ESS2 -MS-3) ESS2.A: Earth's Materials and Systems All Earth processes are the result of energy flowing and matter cycling within and among the planet's systems. This energy is derived from the sun and Earth's hot interior. The energy that flows and matter that cycles produce chemical and physical changes in Earth's materials and living organisms. (ESS2 -MS-1) The planet's systems interact over scales that range from microscopic to global in size, and they operate over fractions of a second to billions of years. These interactions have shaped Earth's history and will determine its future. (ESS2 -MS-2) ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large -Scale System Interactions Maps of ancient land and water patterns, based on investigations of rocks and fossils, make clear how Earth's plates have moved great distances, collided, and spread apart. (ESS2 -MS-3) ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes Water continually cycles among land, ocean, and atmosphere via transpiration, evaporation, condensation and crystallization, and precipitation, as well as downhill flows on land. (ESS2 -MS-4) The complex patterns of the changes and the movement of water in the atmosphere, determined by winds, landforms, and ocean temperatures and currents, are major determinants of local weather patterns. (ESS2 -MS-5) Global movements of water and its changes in form are propelled by sunlight and gravity. (ESS2 -MS-4) Variations in density due to variations in temperature and salinity drive a global pattern of interconnected ocean currents. (ESS2 -MS-6) Water's movements\u2014 both on the land and underground \u2014cause weathering and erosion, which change the land's surface features and create underground formations. (ESS2 -MS-2) ESS2.D: Weather and Climate Weather and climate are influenced by interactions involving sunlight, the ocean, the atmosphere, ice, landforms, and living things. These interactions vary with latitude, altitude, and local and regional geography, all of which can affect oceanic and atmospheric flow patterns. (ESS2 -MS-6) Because these patterns are so complex, weather can only be predicted using probability. (ESS2 -MS-5) The ocean exerts a major influence on weather and climate by absorbing energy from the sun, releasing it over time, and globally redistributing it through ocean currents. (ESS2 -MS-6) ESS3 -MS Earth and Human Activity Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: ESS3 -MS- 1. Construct a scientific explanation based on evidence for how the uneven distributions of Earth's mineral, energy, and groundwater resources are the result of past and current geoscience processes. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how these resources are limited and typically non-renewable, and how their distributions are changing as a result of removal by humans. Examples of uneven distributions of resources as a result of past processes include but are not limited to petroleum (locations of the burial of organic marine sediments and subsequent geologic traps), metal ores (locations of past volcanic and hydrothermal activity associated with subduction zones), and soil (locations of active weathering and/or deposition of rock). STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 98Page | 47 ESS3 -MS-2. Analyze and interpret data on natural hazards to forecast future catastrophic events and inform the development of technologies to mitigate their effects. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how some natural hazards, such as volcanic eruptions and severe weather, are preceded by phenomena that allow for reliable predictions, but others, such as earthquak es, occur suddenly and with no notice, and thus are not yet predictable. Examples of natural hazards can be taken from interior processes (such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions), surface processes (such as mass wasting and tsunamis), or severe weather events (such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods). Examples of data can include the locations, magnitudes, and frequencies of the natural hazards. Examples of technologies can be global (such as satellite systems to monitor hurricanes or forest fires) or local (such as building basements in tornado -prone regions or reservoirs to mitigate droughts). ESS3 -MS- 3. Apply scientific principles to design a method for monitoring and minimizing a human impact on the environment. Further Explanation: Examples of the design process include examining human environmental impacts, assessing the kinds of solutions that are feasible, and designing and evaluating solutions that could reduce that impact. Examples of human impacts can include water usage (such as the withd rawal of water from streams and aquifers or the construction of dams and levees), land usage (such as urban development, agriculture, or the removal of wetlands), and pollution (such as of the air, water, or land). ESS3 -MS- 4. Construct an argument supported by evidence for how increases in human population and per -capita consumption of natural resources impact Earth's systems. Further Explanation: Examples of evidence include grade- appropriate databases on human populations and the rates of consumption of food and natural resources (such as freshwater, mineral, and energy). Examples of impacts can include changes to the appearance, composition, and structure of Earth's systems as well as the rates at which they change. The consequences of increases in human populations and consumption of natural resources are described by science, but science does not make the decisions for the actions society takes. ESS3 -MS- 5. Ask questions to clarify evidence of the factors that have caused the rise in global temperatures over the past century. Further Explanation: Examples of factors include human activities (such as fossil fuel combustion, cement production, and agricultural activity) and natural processes (such as changes in incoming solar radiation or volcanic activity). Examples of evidence can include tables, graphs, and maps of global and regional temperatures, atmospheric levels of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, and the rates of human activities. Emphasis is on the major role that human a ctivities play in causing the rise in global temperatures. Supporting Content ESS3.A: Natural Resources Humans depend on Earth's land, ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere for many different resources. Minerals, fresh water, and biosphere resources are limited, and many are not renewable or replaceable over human lifetimes. These resources are distributed unevenly around the planet as a result of past geologic processes. (ESS3 -MS-1) ESS3.B: Natural Hazards Mapping the history of natural hazards in a region, combined with an understanding of related geologic forces can help forecast the locations and likelihoods of future events. (ESS3 -MS-2) ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems Human activities have altered the biosphere, sometimes damaging or destroying natural habitats and causing the extinction of other species. But changes to Earth's environments can have different impacts (negative and positive) for different living things. (ESS3 -MS-3) Typically as human populations and per-capita consumpti on of natural resources increase, so do the negative impacts on Earth unless the activities and technologies involved are engineered otherwise. (ESS3 -MS-3, ESS3-MS-4) Human activities (such as the release of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuel combustion) are major factors in the current rise in Earth's mean surface temperature. Other natural activities (such as volcanic activity) are also contributors to changing global temperatures. Reducing the level of climate change and reducing human vulnerability to whatever climate changes do occur depend on the understanding of climate science, engineering capabilities, and other kinds of knowledge, such as understanding of human behavior and on applying that knowledge wisely in decisions and activities.

An example of an interacting system could be an artery depending on the proper function of elastic tissue and smooth muscle to regulate and deliver the proper amount of blood within the circulatory system. Content Limit: Assessment does not include interactions and functions at the molecular or chemical reaction level. LS1-HS-3. Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence that feedback mechanisms maintain homeostasis. Further Explanation: Examples of investigations could include heart rate response to exercise, stomate response to moisture and temperature, and root development in response to water levels.

Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using evidence from models and simulations to support explanations. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the details of the specific chemical reactions or identification of macromolecules. LS1-HS-7. Use a model to illustrate that cellular respiration is a chemical process whereby the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and the bonds in new compounds are formed resulting in a net transfer of energy. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 100Page | 49 Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the conceptual understanding of the inputs and outputs of the process of cellular respiration. Content Limit: Assessment should not include identification of the steps or specific processes involved in cellular respiration. Supporting Content LS1.A: Structure and Function Systems of specialized cells within organisms help them perform the essential functions of life. (LS1-HS-1) All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for the formation of proteins, which carry out most of the work of cells. (LS1-HS-1) Multicellular organisms have a hierarchical structural organization, in which any one system is made up of numerous parts and is itself a component of the next level. (LS1- HS-2) Feedback mechanisms maintain a living system's internal conditions within certain limits and mediate behaviors, allowing it to remain alive and functional even as external conditions change within some range. Feedback mechanisms can encourage (through positive feedback) or discourage (negative feedback) what is going on inside the living system. (LS1-HS-3) LS1.B: Growth and Development of Organisms In multicellular organisms individual cells grow and then divide via a process called mitosis, thereby allowing the organism to grow. The organism begins as a single cell (fertilized egg) that divides successively to produce many cells, with each parent cell passing identical genetic material (two variants of each chromosome pair) to both daughter cells. Cellular division and differentiation produce and maintain a complex organism, composed of systems of tissues and organs that work together to meet the needs of the whole organism. (LS1-HS-4) LS1.C: Organization for Matter and Energy Flow in Organisms The process of photosynthesis converts light energy to stored chemical energy by converting carbon dioxide plus water into sugars plus released oxygen. (LS1-HS-5) The sugar molecules thus formed contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen: their hydrocarbon backbones are used to make amino acids and other carbon -based molecules that can be assembled into larger molecules (such as proteins or DNA), used for example to form new cells. (LS1-HS-6) As matter and energy flow through different organizational levels of living systems, chemical elements are recombined in different ways to form different products. (LS1- HS-6, LS1-HS-7) As a result of these chemical reactions, energy is transferred from one system of interacting molecules to another. Cellular respiration is a chemical process in which the bonds of food molecules and oxygen molecules are broken and new compounds are formed that can transport energy to cells. Cellular respiration also releases the energy needed to maintain body temperature despite ongoing energy transfer to the surrounding environment.

Use mathematical and/or computational representations to support explanations of factors that affect carrying capacity of ecosystems at different scales.

Examples of mathematical comparisons could include graphs, charts, histograms, and population changes gathered from simulations or historical data sets. Content Limit: Assessment does not include deriving mathematical equations to make comparisons. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 101Page | 50 LS2-HS-2. Use mathematical representations to support and revise explanations based on evidence about factors affecting biodiversity and populations in ecosystems of different scales. Further Explanation: Examples of mathematical representations include finding the average, determining trends, and using graphical comparisons of multiple sets of data. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to provided data. LS2-HS-3. Construct and revise an explanation based on evidence for the cycling of matter and flow of energy in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on conceptual understanding of the role of aerobic and anaerobic respiration in different environments. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the specific chemical processes of either aerobic or anaerobic respiration. LS2-HS-4. Use mathematical representations to support claims for the cycling of matter and flow of energy among organisms in an ecosystem. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using a mathematical model of stored energy in biomass to describe the transfer of energy from one trophic level to another and that matter and energy are conserved as matter cycles and energy flows through ecosystems. Emphasis is on atoms and molecules such as carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen being conserved as they move through an ecosystem. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to proportional reasoning to describe the cycling of matter and flow of energy. LS2-HS-5. Develop a model to illustrate the role of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in the cycling of carbon among the biosphere, atmosphere, hydrosphere, and geosphere. Further Explanation: Examples of models could include simulations and mathematical models. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the specific chemical steps of photosynthesis and respiration. LS2-HS-6. Evaluate the claims, evidence, and reasoning that the complex interactions in ecosystems maintain relatively consistent numbers and types of organisms in stable conditions, but changing conditions may result in a new ecosystem. Further Explanation: Examples of changes in ecosystem conditions could include modest biological or physical changes, such as a seasonal flood; and extreme changes, such as volcanic eruption or sea level rise. LS2-HS-7. Design, evaluate, and refine a solution for reducing the impacts of human activities on the environment and biodiversity. Further Explanation: Examples of human activities can include urbanization, building dams, and dissemination of invasive species, utilization of non-renewable resources as opposed to renewable resource. LS2-HS-8. Evaluate the evidence for the role of group behavior on individual and species' chances to survive and reproduce. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on: (1) distinguishing between group and individual behavior, (2) identifying evidence supporting the outcomes of group behavior, and (3) developing logical and reasonable arguments based on evidence. Examples of group behaviors could include flocking, schooling, herding, and cooperative behaviors such as hunting, migrating, and swarming. Supporting Content LS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems Ecosystems have carrying capacities, which are limits to the numbers of organisms and populations they can support. These limits result from such factors as the availability of living and nonliving resources and from such challenges such as predation, competition, and disease. Organisms would have the capacity to produce populations of great size were it not for the fact that environments and resources are finite. This fundamental tension affects the abundance (number of individuals) of species in any given ecosystem. (LS2-HS-1, LS2-HS-2) LS2.B: Cycles of Matter and Energy Transfer in Ecosystems STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 102Page | 51 Photosynthesis and cellular respiration (including anaerobic processes) provide most of the energy for life processes. (LS2-HS-3) Plants or algae form the lowest level of the food web. At each link upward in a food web, only a small fraction of the matter consumed at the lower level is transferred upward, to produce growth and release energy in cellular respiration at the higher level. Given this inefficiency, there are generally fewer organisms at higher levels of a food web. Some matter reacts to release energy for life functions, some matter is stored in newly made structures, and much is discarded. The chemical elements that make up the molecules of organisms pass through food webs and into and out of the atmosphere and soil, and they are combined and recombined in different ways. At each link in an ecosystem, matter and energy are conserved. (LS2-HS-4) Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are important components of the carbon cycle, in which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, atmosphere, oceans, and geosphere through chemical, physical, geolo gical, and biological processes. (LS2-HS-5) LS2.C: Ecosystem Dynamics, Functioning, and Resilience A complex set of interactions within an ecosystem can keep its numbers and types of organisms relatively constant over long periods of time under stable conditions. If a modest biological or physical disturbance to an ecosystem occurs, it may return to its more or less original status (i.e., the ecosystem is resilient), as opposed to becoming a very different ecosystem. Extreme fluctuations in conditions or the size of any population, however, can challenge the functioning of ecosystems in terms of resources and habitat availability. (LS2-HS-2, LS2-HS-6) Moreover, anthropogenic changes (induced by human activity) in the environment \u2014including habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, overexploitation, and climate change \u2014can disrupt an ecosystem and threaten the survival of some species. (LS2-HS-7) LS2.D: Social Interactions and Group Behavior Group behavior has evolved because membership can increase the chances of survival for individuals and their genetic relatives, gene pool. (LS2-HS-8) LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans Biodiversity is increased by the formation of new species (speciation) and decreased by the loss of species (extinction). (LS2-HS-7) Humans depend on the living world for the resources and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human activity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity through overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. Thus sustaining biodiversity so that ecosystem functioning and productivity are maintained is essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth. Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by preserving landscapes of recreational or inspirational value. (LS2-HS-7, LS4-HS-6.) LS3-HS Heredity: Inheritance and Variation of Traits Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: LS3-HS- 1. Ask questions to clarify relationships about the role of DNA and chromosomes in coding the instructions for characteristic traits passed from parents to offspring. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process. LS3-HS-2. Make and defend a claim based on evidence that inheritable genetic variations may result from: (1) new genetic combinations through meiosis, (2) viable errors occurring during replication, and/or (3) mutations caused by environmental factors. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using data to support arguments for the way variation occurs. Content Limit: Assessment does not include the phases of meiosis or the biochemical mechanism of specific steps in the process. LS3-HS-3. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to explain the variation and distribution of expressed traits in a population. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the use of mathematics to describe the probability of traits (alleles) as it relates to genetic and environmental factors in the expression STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 103Page | 52 of traits. Content Limit: Assessment does not include Hardy -Weinberg calculations. Supporting Content LS1.A: Structure and Function All cells contain genetic information in the form of DNA molecules. Genes are regions in the DNA that contain the instructions that code for the formation of proteins. (LS3- HS-1, LS1-HS-1.) LS3.A: Inheritance of Traits Each chromosome consists of a single very long DNA molecule, and each gene on the chromosome is a particular segment of that DNA. The instructions for forming species' characteristics are carried in DNA. All cells in an organism have the same genetic content, but the genes used (expressed) by the cell may be regulated in different ways. Not all DNA codes for a protein; some segments of DNA are involved in regulatory or structural functions, and some have no as-yet known function. (LS3-HS-1) LS3.B: Variation of Traits In sexual reproduction, chromosomes can sometimes swap sections during the process of meiosis (cell division), thereby creating new genetic combinations and thus more genetic variation. Although DNA replication is tightly regulated and remarkably accurate, errors do occur and result in mutations, which are also a source of genetic variation. Environmental factors can also cause mutations in genes, and viable mutations are inherited. (LS3-HS-2) Environmental factors also affect expression of traits, and hence affect the probability of occurrences of traits in a population. Thus the variation and distribution of traits observed depends on both genetic and environmental factors. (LS3-HS-2, LS3-HS-3) LS4-HS Biological Adaptation: Unity and Diversity Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: LS4-HS- 1. Communicate scientific information that common ancestry and biological evolution are supported by multiple lines of empirical evidence. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on a conceptual understanding of the role each line of evidence has relating to common ancestry and biological evolution. Examples of evidence could include similarities in DNA sequences, anatomical structures, and order of appearance of structures in embryological development. LS4-HS-2. Construct an explanation based on evidence that the process of evolution primarily results from four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the heritable genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for limited resources, and (4) the proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in the environment. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using evidence to explain the influence each of the four factors has on number of organisms, behaviors, morphology, or physiology in terms of ability to compete for limited resources and subsequent survival of individuals and adaptation of species. Examples of evidence could include mathematical models such as simple distribution graphs and proportional reasoning. Content Limit: Assessment does not include other mechanisms of evolution, such as genetic drift, gene flow through migration, and co-evolution. LS4-HS-3. Apply concepts of statistics and probability to support explanations that organisms with an advantageous heritable trait tend to increase in proportion to organisms lacking this trait. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on analyzing shifts in numerical distribution of traits and using these shifts as evidence to support explanations. Content Limit: Assessment is limited to basic statistical and graphical analysis. Assessment does not include allele frequency calculations. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 104Page | 53 LS4-HS-4. Construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using data to provide evidence for how specific biotic and abiotic differences in ecosystems (such as ranges of seasonal temperature, long-term climate change, acidity, light, geographic barriers, or evolution of other organisms) contribute to a change in gene frequency over time, leading to adaptation of populations. LS4-HS-5. Evaluate the evidence supporting claims that changes in environmental conditions may result in: (1) increases in the number of individuals of some species, (2) the emergence of new species over time, and (3) the extinction of other species. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on determining cause and effect relationships for how changes to the environment such as deforestation, over fishing, application of fertilizers and pesticides, drought, flood, and the rate of change of the environment affect distribution or disappearance of traits in species. LS4-HS-6. Create or revise a simulation to test a solution to mitigate adverse impacts of human activity on biodiversity. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on designing solutions for a proposed problem related to threatened or endangered species, or to genetic variation of organisms for multiple species. Supporting Content LS4.A: Evidence of Common Ancestry and Diversity Genetic information, like the fossil record, provides evidence of evolution. DNA sequences vary among species, but there are many overlaps; in fact, the ongoing branching that produces multiple lines of descent can be inferred by comparing the DNA sequences of different organisms. Such information is also derivable from the similarities and differences in amino acid sequences and from anatomical and embryological evidence. (LS4-HS-1) LS4.B: Natur al Selection Natural selection occurs only if there is both (1) variation in the genetic information between organisms in a population and (2) variation in the expression of that genetic information \u2014that is, trait variation \u2014that leads to differences in performance among individuals. (LS4-HS-2, LS4-HS-3) The traits that positively affect survival are more likely to be reproduced, and thus are more common in the population. (LS4-HS-3) LS4.C: Adaptation Evolution is a consequence of the interaction of four factors: (1) the potential for a species to increase in number, (2) the genetic variation of individuals in a species due to mutation and sexual reproduction, (3) competition for an environment's limite d supply of the resources that individuals need in order to survive and reproduce, and (4) the ensuing proliferation of those organisms that are better able to survive and reproduce in that environment. (LS4-HS-2) Natural selection leads to adaptation, that is, to a population dominated by organisms that are anatomically, behaviorally, and physiologically well suited to survive and reproduce in a specific environment. That is, the differential survival and reproduction of organisms in a population that have an advantageous heritable trait leads to an increase in the proportion of individuals in future generations that have the trait and to a decrease in the proportion of individuals that do not. (LS4-HS-3, LS4-HS-4) Adaptation also means that the distribution of traits in a population can change when conditions change. (LS4-HS-3) Changes in the physical environment, whether naturally occurring or human induced, have thus contributed to the expansion of some species, the emergence of new distinct species as populations diverge under different conditions, and the decline -and sometimes the extinction -of some species. (LS4-HS-5, LS4-HS-6) Species become extinct because they can no longer survive and reproduce in their altered environment. If members cannot adjust to change that is too fast or drastic, the opportunity for the species' evolution is lost. (LS4-HS-5) LS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans Humans depend on the living world for the resources and other benefits provided by biodiversity. But human activity is also having adverse impacts on biodiversity through overpopulation, overexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution, introduction of invasive species, and climate change. Thus sustaining biodiversity so that ecosystem functioning and productivity are maintained is essential to supporting and enhancing life on Earth. Sustaining biodiversity also aids humanity by preserving landscapes of recreational or inspirational value. (LS4-HS-6, LS2-HS-7.) ETS1.B: Developing Possible Solutions STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 105Page | 54 When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, and to co nsider social, cultural, and environmental impacts. (LS4-HS-6) Both physical models and computers can be used in various ways to aid in the engineering design process. Computers are useful for a variety of purposes, such as running simulations to test different ways of solving a problem or to see which one is most efficient or economical; and in making a persuasive presentation to a cli ent about how a given design will meet his or her n eeds.

The wave model is useful for explai ning many features of electromagnetic radiation, and the particle model explains other features. (PSC3 -HS-1) PS3.A: Definitions of Energy Energy is a quantitative property of a system that depends on the motion and interactions of matter and radiation within that system. That there is a single quantity called energy is due to the fact that a system's total energy is conserved, even as, within the system, energy is continually transferred from one object to another and between its various possible forms. (PSC3 -HS-2, PSC3-HS-3) At the macroscopic scale, energy manifests itself in multiple ways, such as in motion, sound, light, and thermal energy. (PSC3 -HS-3, PSC3-HS-4) These relationships are better understood at the microscopic scale, at which all of the different manifestations of energy can be modeled as a combination of energy associated with the motion of particles and energy associated with the configuration (relative position of the particles). In some cases the relative position energy can be thought of as stored in fields (which mediate interactions between particles). This last concept includes radiation, a phenomenon in which energy stored in fields moves across space. (PSC3 -HS-3) PS3.B: Conservation of Energy and Energy Transfer Conservation of energy means that the total change of energy in any system is always equal to the total energy transferred into or out of the system. (PSC3 -HS-2) Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transported from one place to another and transferred between systems. (PSC3 -HS-2, PSC3-HS-5) Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on its configuration (e.g. relative positions of charged particles, compression of a spring) and how kinetic energy depends on mass and speed, allow the concept of conservation of energy to be used to predict and describe system behavior. (PSC3 -HS-2) The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system. (PSC3 -HS-2) Uncontrolled systems always evolve toward more stable states\u2014 that is, toward more uniform energy distribution (e.g., water flows downhill, objects hotter than their surrounding environment cool down).

Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the way nucleosynthesis, and therefore the different elements created, varies as a function of the mass of a star and the stage of its lifetime. Content Limit: Details of the many different nucleosynthesis pathways for stars of differing masses are not assessed. ESS1 -HS-4. Use mathematical or computational representations to predict the motion of orbiting objects in the solar system. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on Newtonian gravitational law s governing orbital motions, which apply to human- made satellites as well as planets and moons. Content Limit: Mathematical representations for the gravitational attraction of bodies and Kepler's Laws of orbital motions should not deal with more than two bodies, nor involve calculus. ESS1 -HS-5. Evaluate evidence of the past and current movements of continental and oceanic crust and the theory of plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the ability of plate tectonics to explain the ages of crustal rocks. Examples include evidence of the ages oceanic crust increasing with distance from mid- ocean ridges (a result of plate spreading) and the ages of North American continental crust increasin g with distance away from a central ancient core (a result of past plate interactions). ESS1 -HS-6. Apply scientific reasoning and evidence from ancient Earth materials, meteorites, and other planetary surfaces to construct an account of Earth's formation and early history. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on using available evidence within the solar system to reconstruct the early history of Earth, which formed along with the rest of the solar system. Examples of evidence include the absolute ages of ancient materials (obtained by radiometric dating of meteorites, moon rocks, and Earth's oldest minerals), the sizes and compositions of solar system objects, and the impact cratering record of planetary surfaces. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 117Page | 66 Supporting Content ESS1 .A : The Universe and Its Stars The star called the sun is changing and will burn out over a lifespan of approximately 10 billion years. (ESS1 -HS-1) The study of stars' light spectra and brightness is used to identify compositional elements of stars, their movements, and their distances from Earth. (ESS1 -HS-2, ESS1-HS- 3) The Big Bang theory is a current scientific model of the origin of the universe that is supported by evidence such as observations of distant galaxies receding from our own, of the measured composition of stars and non-stellar gases, and of the maps of spectra of the primordial radiation (cosmic microwave background) that still fills the universe. Other than the hydrogen and helium formed at the time of the event, nuclear fusion within stars produces all atomic nuclei lighter than and including iron, and the process releases electromagnetic energy. Heavier elements are produced when certain massive stars achieve a supernova stage and explode. (ESS1 -HS-2, ESS1-HS-3) ESS1 .B: Earth and the Solar System Kepler's laws describe common features of the motions of orbiting objects, including their elliptical paths around the sun. Orbits may change due to the gravitational effects from, or collisions with, other objects in the solar system. (ESS1 -HS-4) ESS1 .C: The History of Planet Earth Continental rocks are generally much older than the rocks of the ocean floor. (ESS1 -HS-5) Although active geologic processes, such as plate tectonics and erosion, have destroyed or altered most of the very early rock record on Earth, other objects in the solar system, such as lunar rocks, asteroids, and meteorites, have changed little over billions of years. Studying these objects can provide information about Earth's formation and early history. (ESS1 -HS-6) ESS2 .B: Plate Tectonics and Large -Scale System Interactions Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth's surface and provides a framework for understanding its geologic history. (ESS1 -HS-5) PS1 .C: Nuclear Processes Spontaneous radioactive decay follows a characteristic exponential decay law. Nuclear lifetimes allow radiometric dating to be used to determine the ages of rocks and other materials. (ESS1 -HS-5, ESS1-HS-6) PS3 .D: Energy in Chemical Processes and Everyday Life Nuclear Fusion processes in the center of the sun release the energy that ultimately reaches Earth as radiation. (ESS1 -HS-1) PS4 .B Electromagnetic Radiation Atoms of each element emit and absorb characteristic frequencies of light. These characteristics allow identification of the presence of an element, even in microscopic quantities. (ESS1 -HS-2) ESS2 -HS Earth's Systems Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: ESS2 -HS-1. Develop a model to illustrate how Earth's internal and surface processes operate at different spatial and temporal scales to form continental and ocean -floor features. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on how the appearance of land features (such as mountains, valleys, and plateaus) and sea-floor features (such as trenches, ridges, and seamounts) are a result of both constructive forces (such as volcanism, tectonic uplift, and orogeny) and destructive mechanisms (such as weathering, mass wasting, and coastal erosion). Content Limit: Assessment does not include memorization of the details of the formation of specific geographic features of Earth's surface. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 118Page | 67 ESS2 -HS-2. Analyze geoscience data to make the claim that one change to Earth's surface can create feedbacks that cause changes to other Earth systems. Further Explanation: Examples should include climate feedbacks, such as how an increase in greenhouse gases causes a rise in global temperatures that melts glacial ice, which reduces the amount of sunlight reflected from Earth's surface, increasing surface temperatures and further reducing the amount of ice. Examples could also be taken from other system interactions, such as how the loss of ground vegetation causes an increase in water runoff and soil erosion; how dammed rivers increase groundwater recharge, decrease sediment transport, and increase coastal erosion; or how the loss of wetlands causes a decrease in local humidity that further reduces the wetland extent. ESS2 -HS-3. Develop a model based on evidence of Earth's interior to describe the cycling of matter by thermal convection. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on both a one-dimensional model of Earth, with radial layers determined by density, and a three-dimensional model, which is controlled by mantle convection and the resulting plate tectonics. Examples of evidence include maps of Earth's three- dimensional structure obtained from seismic waves, records of the rate of change of Earth's magnetic field (as constraints on convection in the outer core), and identification of the composition of Earth's layers from high-pressure laboratory experiments. ESS2 -HS-4. Use a model to describe how variations in the flow of energy into and out of Earth's systems result in changes in climate. Further Explanation: Examples of the causes of climate change differ by timescale, over 1-10 years: large volcanic eruption, ocean circulation; 10-100s of years: changes in human activity, ocean circulation, solar output; 10-100s of thousands of years: changes to Earth's orbit and the orientation of its axis; and 10-100s of millions of years: long-term changes in atmospheric composition. Content Limit: Assessment of the results of changes in climate is limited to changes in surface temperatures, precipitation patterns, glacial ice volumes, sea levels, and biosphere distribution. ESS2 -HS-5. Plan and conduct an investigation of the properties of water and its effects on Earth materials and surface processes. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on mechanical and chemical investigations with water and a variety of solid materials to provide the evidence for connections between the hydrologic cycle and system interactions commonly known as the rock cycle. Examples of mechanical investigations include stream transportation and deposition using a stream table, erosion using variations in soil moisture content, or frost wedging by the expansion of water as it freezes. Examples of chemical investigations include chemical weathering and recrystallization (by testing the solubility of different materials) or melt generation (by examining how water lowers the melting temperature of most solids). ESS2 -HS-6. Develop a quantitative model to describe the cycling of carbon among the hydrosphere, atmosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on modeling biogeochemical cycles that include the cycling of carbon through the ocean, atmosphere, soil, and biosphere (including humans), providing the foundation for living organisms. ESS2 -HS-7. Construct an argument based on evidence about the simultaneous coevolution of Earth's systems and life on Earth. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the dynamic causes, effects, and feedbacks between the biosphere and Earth's other systems, whereby geoscience factors control the evolution of life, which in turn continuously alters Earth's surface. Examples of include how photosynthetic life altered the atmosphere through the production of oxygen, which in turn increased weathering rates and allowed for the evolution of animal life; how microbial life on land increased the formation of soil, which in turn allowed for the evolution of land plants; or how the evolution of corals created reefs that altered patterns of erosion and deposition along coastlines and provided habitats for the evolution of new life forms. Content Limit: Assessment does not include a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms of how the biosphere interacts with all of Earth's other systems. Supporting Content ESS1.B: Earth and the Solar System Cyclical changes in the shape of Earth's orbit around the sun, together with changes in the tilt of the planet's axis of rotation, both occurring over hundreds of thousands of years, have altered the intensity and distribution of sunlight falling on the earth. These phenomena cause a cycle of ice ages and other gradual climate changes. (ESS2 - HS-4) STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 119Page | 68 ESS2.A: Earth Materials and Systems Earth's systems, being dynamic and interacting, cause feedback effects that can increase or decrease the original changes. (ESS2 -HS-1, ESS2-HS-2) Evidence from deep probes and seismic waves, reconstructions of historical changes in Earth's surface and its magnetic field, and an understanding of physical and chemical processes lead to a model of Earth with a hot but solid inner core, a liquid outer core, a solid mantle and crust. Motions of the mantle and its plates occur primarily through thermal convection, which involves the cycling of matter due to the outward flow of energy from Earth's interior and gravitational movement of denser materials toward the interior. (ESS2 -HS-3) The geological record shows that changes to global and regional climate can be caused by interactions among changes in the sun's energy output or Earth's orbit, tectonic events, ocean circulation, volcanic activity, glaciers, vegetation, and human activities. These changes can occur on a variety of time scales from sudden (e.g., volcanic ash clouds) to intermediate (ice ages) to very long-term tectonic cycles. (ESS2 -HS-4) ESS2.B: Plate Tectonics and Large -Scale System Interactions The radioactive decay of unstable isotopes continually generates new energy within Earth's crust and mantle, providing the primary source of the heat that drives mantle convection. Plate tectonics can be viewed as the surface expression of mantle convection. (ESS2 -HS-3) Plate tectonics is the unifying theory that explains the past and current movements of the rocks at Earth's surface and provides a framework for understanding its geologic history. Plate movements are responsible for most continental and ocean -floor features and for the distribution of most rocks and minerals within Earth's crust. (ESS2 -HS- 1) ESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth's Surface Processes The abundance of liquid water on Earth's surface and its unique combination of physical and chemical properties are central to the planet's dynamics. These properties include water's exceptional capacity to absorb, store, and release large amounts of energy, transmit sunlight, expand upon freezing, dissolve and transport materials, and lower the viscosities and melting points of rocks. (ESS2 -HS-5) ESS2.D: Weather and Climate The foundation for Earth's global climate systems is the electromagnetic radiation from the sun, as well as its reflection, absorption, storage, and redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and land systems, and this energy's re-radiation into space. (ESS2 -HS-2, ESS2-HS-4) Gradual atmospheric changes were due to plants and other organisms that captured carbon dioxide and released oxygen. (ESS2 -HS-6, ESS2-HS-7) Changes in the atmosphere due to human activity have increased carbon dioxide concentrations and thus affect climate. (ESS2 -HS-6, ESS2-HS-4) ESS2.E: Biogeology The many dynamic and delicate feedbacks between the biosphere and other Earth systems cause a continual co-evolution of Earth's surface and the life that exists on it. (ESS2 -HS-7) PS4.A: Wave Properties Geologists use seismic waves and their reflection at interfaces between layers to probe structures deep in the planet. (ESS2 -HS-3) ESS3 -HS Earth and Human Activity Performance Standards Students who demonstrate understanding can: ESS3 -HS-1. Construct an explanation based on evidence for how the availability of natural resources, occurrence of natural hazards, and changes in climate have influenced human activity. Further Explanation: Examples of key natural resources include access to fresh water (such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater), regions of fertile soils such as river deltas, and high concentrations of minerals and fossil fuels. Examples of natural hazards can be from interior processes (such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes), surface processes (such as tsunamis, mass wasting and soil erosion), and severe weather (such as hurricanes, floods, and droughts). Examples of the results of changes in climate that can affect populations or drive mass migrations include changes to sea level, regional patterns of temperature and precipitation, and the types of crops and livestock that can be raised. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 120Page | 69 ESS3 -HS-2. Evaluate competing design solutions for developing, managing, and utilizing energy and mineral resources based on cost-benefit ratios. Further Explanation: Emphasis is on the conservation, recycling, and reuse of resources (such as minerals and metals) where possible, and on minimizing impacts where it is not. Examples include developing best practices for agricultural soil use, mining (for coal, tar sands, and oil shales), and pumping (for petroleum and natural gas). Science knowledge indicates what can happen in natural systems\u2014 not what should happen. ESS3 -HS-3. Create a computational simulation to illustrate the relationships among management of natural resources, the sustainability of human populations, and biodiversity. Further Explanation: Examples of factors that affect the management of natural resources include costs of resource extraction and waste management, per-capita consumption, and the development of new technologies. Examples of factors that affect human sustainability include agricultural efficiency, levels of conservation, and urban planning. Content Limit: Assessment for computational simulations is limited to using provided multi-parameter programs or constructing simplified spreadsheet calculations. ESS3 -HS-4. Evaluate or refine a technological solution that reduces impacts of human activities on natural systems. Further Explanation: Examples of data on the impacts of human activities could include the quantities and types of pollutants released, changes to biomass and species diversity , or areal changes in land surface use (such as for urban development, agriculture and livestock, or surface mining). Examples for limiting future impacts could range from local efforts (such as reducing, reusing, and recycling resources) to large-scale geoengineering design solutions (such as altering global temperatures by making large changes to the atmosphere or ocean). ESS3 -HS-5. Analyze geoscience data and the results from global climate models to make an evidence- based forecast of the current rate of global or regional climate change and associated future impacts to Earth systems. Further Explanation: Examples of evidence, for both data and climate model outputs, are for climate changes (such as precipitation and temperature) and their associated impacts (such as on sea level, glacial ice volumes, or atmosphere and ocean composition). Content Limit: Assessment is limited to one example of a climate change and its associated impacts. ESS3 -HS-6. Use a computational representation to illustrate the relationships among Earth systems and how those relationships are being modified due to human activity. Further Explanation: Examples of Earth systems to be considered are the hydrosphere, atmosphere, cryosphere, geosphere, and/or biosphere . A n example of the far- reaching impacts from a human activity is how an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide results in an increase in photosynthetic biomass on land and an increase in ocean acidification, with resulting impacts on sea organism health and marine populations. Content Limit: Assessment does not include running computational representations but is limited to using the published results of scientific computational models. Supporting Content ESS2 .D: Weather and Climate Current models predict that, although future regional climate changes will be complex and varied, average global temperatures will continue to rise. The outcomes predicted by global climate models strongly depend on the amounts of human- generated greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere each year and by the ways in which these gases are absorbed by the ocean and biosphere. (ESS3 -HS-6) ESS3 .A : Natural Resources Resource availability has guided the development of human society. (ESS3 -HS-1) All forms of energy production and other resource extraction have associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. New technologies and social regulations can change the balance of these factors. (ESS3 -HS-2) ESS3 .B: Natural Hazards Natural hazards and other geologic events have shaped the course of human history. They have altered the sizes of human populations and have driven human migrations. (ESS3 -HS-1) ESS3 .C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems The sustainability of human societies and the biodiversity that supports them requires responsible management of natural resources. (ESS3 -HS-3) Scientists and engineers can make major contributions by developing technologies that produce less pollution and waste and that preclude ecosystem degradation. (ESS3 - HS-4) Though the magnitudes of human impacts are greater than they have ever been, so too are human abilities to model, predict, and manage current and future impacts. (ESS3 -HS-5) STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 2 Page 121Page | 70 Through computer simulations and other studies, important discoveries are still being made about how the ocean, the atmosphere, and the biosphere interact and are modified in response to human activities. (ESS3 -HS-6) ET S1 .B: Developing Possible Solutions When evaluating solutions, it is important to take into account a range of constraints, including cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics, and to consider social, cultural, environmental impacts.

The PSC reviews the recommendations of the Standards Committee and makes recommendation s to the State Board of Education for approval consideration . EDUCATOR PREPARATION STANDARDS REVIEWS The purpose of educator preparation standards reviews is to define and establish rigorous and research -based stand ards that better align with national standards and best practices. The standards provide requirements for educator preparation programs to ensure that future educators acquire the knowledg e and performance standards to best meet the needs of students. IDAPA 08.02.02.004 directs t hat the PSC continuously review/revise 20 percent of the standards per year. The review process involves teams of content area experts from higher education faculty and educators in K -12 Idaho schools . The standards are then reviewed and presented to the State Board of Education for approval. Once approved, they are reviewed and approved by the l egislature and become an incorporated -by-reference document in State Board r ule. The following standards were reviewed by the PSC durin g the 2015-2016 s chool year: Elementary Education Mathematics Pre-Service Technology Science (Biology, Chemistry, Earth and Space Science, Natural Science, Physical Science, and Physics) Visual/Performing Arts (Music, Theater Arts, Visual Arts) EDUCATOR PREPARATION PROGRAM REVIEWS Each teacher preparation program will undergo a state program approval process that is designed to assure that graduates meet the Idaho standards for beginning teachers and other professional educators . The PSC follows the nati onal accreditation council model by which institutions pursue continuing approval through a full program review every seven (7) years. Additionally, the PSC conducts State -Specific Requirement Reviews, not to exceed every third year following the full pro gram review. T he requirements are defined in IDAPA 08.02.02.100: Rules Governing Uniformity and the CAEP s tandards. The process for teacher preparation program approval is specifically defined in the Manual of Instruction for State Approval of Idaho Teacher Preparation Programs on file at the State Department of Education, Certification/Professional Standards. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 3 Page 18The standards for evaluating teacher preparation programs are found in the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel as updated and approved by the State Board of Education. For review purposes, pertinent rubrics accompanying these standards are on file in the office of the State Department of Education , Certif ication/ Professional Standards . These documents are also available for review on the State Department of Education website: http://sde.idaho.gov/cert -psc/psc/standards.html Current CAEP standards can be reviewed on the following CAEP website: http://caepnet.org/ Current PSC materials, reports, and resources are also available on the State Department of Education website at: http://sde.idaho.gov/cert -psc/psc/ The following educator preparation programs were reviewed by the PSC during the 2015-2016 s chool year: Northwest Nazarene University A state/NCATE on-site program review visit was held at Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) on February 28 - March 3, 2015.

History: [33-1203, added 1963, ch. 13, sec. 145, p. 27.] STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 4 Page 6 STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION - EMERGENCY PROVISIONAL CERTIFICATE INFORMATIO N: The State Board of Education (SBOE) will now review all applications for one-year emergency provisional certification. The Professional Standards Commission will continue to review all applications for the Alternative Authorization-Teacher to New, Content Specialist, and Pupil Personnel Services. Emergency Provisional Certificate application allows a district/charter to request one-year emergency certifica tion for a candidate who does not hold a current Idaho certificate/credential, but who has strong content back ground and some educational pedagogy, to fill an area of need that requires certifica tion/endorsement. Emergency Provisional Certificate is a district request, and the application must be submitted as one complete packet. The district/charter must provide documented proof that an emergency exists. The candidate for whom the authorization is being requested must have at least two (2) years of college training. In order to determine what endorsement is needed for specific assignments, please access the annual SDE Assignment Credential Manual which is posted under the ISEE Manuals drop down toward the bottom of the following ISEE website: http://sde.idaho.gov/tech-services/isee/index.html The SBOE will review the application(s) submitted. The SBOE will review only complete packets. If approved, t he emergency provisional certification will be valid for the school year for which the application is submitte d and approved. The candidate for whom the Emergency Provisional Certificate is approved can teach under the emergency provisional certification one time only. If the candidate wishes to continue teaching with a district/charter the following school year, the candidate must be enrolled in an educator preparation program and be eligible for the Alternative Authorization-Teacher to New, Content Specialist, or Pupil Personnel Servic es. Candidates who have previously taught under the Provisional Authorization and/or Alternative Authorization-Content Specialist are not eligible for emergency provisional certification. While the candidate is under emergency provisional certification, no financial penalties will be assessed to the hiring district. Review of all applications for emergency provisional certificates will adhere to the SBOE's formal meeting schedule. Applications for emergency provisional certificates will be reviewed within two SBOE meetings (i.e., if the application does not make it onto the agenda for the upcoming SBOE meeting, it will be put on the agenda for the next SBOE meeting).

A list of ninety (90) additional members were appointed to do a one-time review. February 2015 The Board approved the removal of an audio clip and associated items per the recommendation of the committee members. August 2016 The Board appointed new committee members. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Section 33-134, Idaho Code - Assessment Item Review Committee BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION In accordance with Section 33-134, Idaho Code, the Board approved a review committee of thirty (30) individuals from each of the six (6) educational regions in the state, representing par ents of students, teachers, administrators, and school board members in Idaho's pub lic education system. The committee reviews the computer adaptive test questions on the summative ISAT developed by Smarter Balanced, in ELA/Literacy and Math , for bias and sensitivity. The committee is authorized to make recommendations to the Board and the State Department of Education to revi se or eliminate summative computer adaptive test questions from the assessment forms. The Board shall make the final determination regarding the adoption or rejection of the committee's recommendations. The Bias and Sensitivity Committee is recommending the removal of the following items from the 2017 ISAT by Smarter Balanced Assessment: Three (3) ELA items One (1) grade 11 passage with five (5) associated items One (1) grade 8 passage with eleven (11) associated items One (1) grade 6 math items IMPACT If any or all items/passages are approved fo r removal by the Board, this action will require a new and separat e item configuration for the online delivery of both the ELA and Math assessment s for the state of Idaho. The work required to generate the separate test c onfiguration will carry a one- time financial impact of $57,000. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 2 Additionally, the grade 8 passage ID 1507 appears on the accommodated paper test form. If this passage is approved for rejection, there will be an estimated $30,000 cost associated with having to produce a new accommodated grade 8 ELA form. The Smarter Balanced Consorti um would also need to be involved in this effort.

Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ Bias and Sensitivity Review Committee Recommendations September 2016 STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 3Background and Introduction In accordance with Idaho Code \u00a7 33 -134 - Assessment Item Review Committee , the American Institutes for R esearch (AIR) and the Idaho State Department of E ducation (SDE) established a review committee intended to ensure that stakeholders of Idaho's public education system (parents, teachers, administrators, and school board members) have the opportunity to review the type s of questions that are being used on Idaho state assessments. The law requires that a committee of thirty individuals representing each of the six e ducation regions of the state annually review all summative computer adaptive test questions for possible issues of bias and sensitivity. The committee is authorized to make recommendations to the State Board of Education and the State Department of E ducation regarding the revis ion or eliminat ion of summative computer adaptive test questions from the state assessments. According to the law, the committee is to consist of 30 Idaho residents and shall include the following members from the six regions of Idah o and shall be appointed by t he State Board of Education: two parents of public school or public charter school students ; one public school or public charter school teacher; one member who is an administrator of a school district or public charter school ; and one member from the district board of trustees or public charter school board of directors . In 201 6, pursuant to this law, 798 items ( 515 English Language Arts /Literacy and 283 Mathematics) items require d committee review. Following recommendations by the Idaho Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), a process was established by which each item was reviewed by three c ommittee members , chosen at random from the overall committee pool. Small group discussion s ensued for items that were \"flagged\" as displaying bias and sensitivity issues by 2/3 rds of the committee members. General, large group discussions ensued for items that were \"flagged\" as displaying bias and sensitivity issues by 1/3rd of the small group discussion participants. After being trained by AIR staff in how to identify items displaying bias and sensitivity concerns (Attachments 1 and 2), committee participants were asked to call out (\"flag\") items for possible small group discussion . Figure 1 illustrate s the Content Rater Interface (a software application) in which panelists would view the item, \" flag\" it if necessary , and add a comment. In Round Two, the panelists discussed the multi -flagged items in small groups and then the panelists individually voted on the items again. Items which were flagged by 2 /3 (18 members) of the committee moved onto Round Three , which consisted of large group discussions designed to determine the final list of items that would be recommended to the State Board of Education for their review. The State Board would consider rejecting these flagged items from the spring 2017 summative computer adaptive tests. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 4 This year's committee of twenty -seven (27) members includ ed six (6) teachers, six (6 ) administrators, eleven (11) parents and four (4) school board members. Process and Training For ease of assignment and review by the committee, AIR organized the items into batches broken down by subject. There were 35 English Language Arts /Literacy (ELA /L) batches and 18 Mathematics batches were created by AIR prior to the committee meeting . The 515 ELA/L items were assembled into thirty -five batches. Each batch contained between 13 and 1 9 items. Each of the 35 ELA/L batches was then assigned to three different committee members at random . The 283 Mathematics items were assembled into eight een batches. Each batch contained between 12 and 17 items . Each of the eighteen Mathematics batches was then assigned to three different committee members at random . AIR configured its ' Item Tracking System software to create a \"Bias and Sensitivity ( BnS) Survey\" in its Content Rater application so that committee members could submit electronic feedback about each item in real time . As shown in F igure 1, the user interface for Content Rater display ed each item with a \"click -to-enlarge \" box that contained the \" Item Rating Question\" (with comment boxes for feedback), an \"Item Overview \" dialog pane, which include d information about the content alignment of the item , and an \"Item Content Web P review\" dialog pane , which presents a rendering of the item as it would appear to a student taking an actual administration. The Content Rater application contained a single question for the committee to answer : \"Bias and Sensitivity: Meets Criteria.\" A response of \"Yes\" or \"No\" was requir ed for this question on each item that an individual reviewed. I f a participant determined that the item did not meet the Bias and Sensitivity criteria as outlined in the training presentation, and as per standing AIR L.A.B.S. guidelines (i.e., the item di d display a bias and sensitivity concern; see Attachment 3 ), then the panelist would select \" No.\" A \"No\" response from a panelist would require a comment explaining the panelist's reasoning. Prior to the committee meeting, AIR created usernames and passwords for each committee member within the Item Tracking System. AIR loaded and pre- assigned (randomly) several batches for each committee member to review. Participants were instructed to ask for additional batches as they completed and submitted their initial assignments. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 5Figure 1. Content Rater Interface In order to train the committee on identifying possible bias and sensitivity concerns in items, AIR created and presented the \"Idaho Bias & Sensitivity Review\" PowerPoint presentation that is shown in Attachment 2 . Additionally, AIR provided a handout en titled \"Summary of Language Accessibility, Bias, and Sensitivity (L.A.B.S.) Guidelines\" ( Attachment 3) that committee members were able to reference during their reviews. Upon completion of the Bias and Sensitivity training, the committee was trained on how to log into the Item Tracking System to use Content Rater to submit their feedback on each item electronically. Round One \u2014Specific Procedure and Results AIR set up computers in a classroom- style room arrangement in order to facilitate individual reviews by the panelists. In order to monitor the committee's progress, AIR provided daily progress reports to SDE for r eview each morning. At the conclusion of Round One, all 798 items were reviewed by at least three committee members. In order to determine which items would move on to Round Two for small group discussion, AIR identified which Item ID's had been flagged by two or more committee members. Specifically, an item was flagged when a committee member answered \"No\" to the \"Bias and Sensitivity: Meets Criteria\" question. Therefore, an item with \"Zero Flags\" means that none of the committee members answered \"No.\" An item with \"One Flag\" means that one of the committee members answered \"No.\" An item with \"Two Flags\" means that two of the committee members answered \"No.\" An item STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 6with \"Three Flags\" means that three of the committee members answered \"No.\" As advised by Idaho's TAC, only the items with t wo or more flags would move on to Round Two. A detailed summary of results of Round One is given below in Table 1 . Table 1.

One reviewer flagged 45 % of all of the Mathematics and English Language Arts /Literacy items he/she reviewed. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 7Figure 2. Number of Reviewers that Flagged a Particular Percentage of Items Round Two \u2014Specific Procedure and Result s For Round 2, t he committee was asked to conduct another individual review on each item that was flagged by t wo or more members from Round 1 then discuss the item(s) in small group break -out session. Prior to the small group discussions, all committee members were given the opportunity to view each item/passage that was advanced to Round 2. At the end of the small group discussions, the committee members were asked to vote individually on the multi -flagged items a second time. Round 1 had multi -flagged a total of 7 ELA item s, 4 ELA passages and one math item for review by the smaller group and a batch of the one multi -flagged item was created. The small group committee members used the same Content Rater Interface and were asked to answer the same \"Bias and Sensitivity: Meets Criteria\" question. A response of \"Yes\" or \"No\" was required for each item; if individuals determined the item did not meet the Bias and Sensitivity criteria as outlined in the training presentation and the 8 3 4 2 0 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 1 0123456789Number of Reviewers Percentage of Items Flagged Number of Reviewers that Flagged a Particular Percentage of the Mathematics and English Language Arts Items Reviewed During Round 1 STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 8L.A.B.S. guidelines , then he/ she answered the \"Bias and Sensitivity: Meets Criteria\" question \"No ,\" and entered a comment explaining his/her reasoning.

Round 3 Poll Results for math item 42953 Implications of Rejecting All Proposed Items/Passages AIR has completed the analysis of the impacted Item Bank pools to determine risks associated with rejecting all the items and passage identified by the 2016 Bias and Sensitivity Committee. It is AIR's recommendation that if any or all items/passages are approved for rejection b y the State Board o f Education, that this action will require a new and separate item configuration for the online delivery of both the ELA and Math assessments for the state of Idaho . The work required to generate the separate test configuration will carry a one -time financial impact of $57,000. Additionally, the grade 8 passage ID 1507 appears on the accommodated paper test form. If this passage is approved for rejection, there will be a n estimated $30,000 cost associated with having to produce a new acc ommodated grade 8 ELA form . The Smarter Balanced Consortium would also need to be involved in this effort. For additional questions, please contact Karlynn Laraway , Interim Director of Assessment , at the Idaho State Department of Education, 208-332-6976, or klaraway@sde.idaho.gov .

The committee, known as the Bias and Sensitivity Committee, was created by the Idaho Legislature in 2014 through Idaho Code 33 -133. -SB1396. Adds to existing law to establish a review committee and to provide that the committee will review certain test questions and make recommendations. The review increases test validity by removing features of a test that are construct -irrelevant, that is, features that could unfairly interfere with a test -taker's performance. AIR Fairness Guidelines 1.Stereotypes 2.Inflammatory or Controversial Accessibility STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 1811/14/2016 3 1.

STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 2511/14/2016 10 5. Population Diversity Tests should reflect in a positive fashion the racial and ethnic composition of the testing population. Tests must avoid ethnocentrism. Reflect the Diversity of the Population Use materials written by members of diverse groups. Use material that reflects the experiences of diverse groups. Portray people in positive, nontraditional roles. Be accurate when referring to population subgroups. Consider factors such as names, cultural references, pictures, and roles. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 2611/14/2016 11 Appropriate References Be as specific as possible. Use the term people use to refer to themselves. 6. Topic Familiarity Tests must avoid words, phrases, concepts, and beliefs that are irrelevant to the testing domain and are likely to be differentially familiar to groups (gender, racial, geographical, socioeconomic, religious, ethnic, disability) of the testing population.

Linguistic Features/ Language Accessibility Tests must be free of language that could unfairly hinder the performance of nonnative speakers of nonstandard dialects of English, and people with language disorders. Three Categories Style Grammar Vocabulary STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 3211/14/2016 17 Style Issues to Avoid Wordiness Multiple Subordinate Clauses -A group of words that has both a subject and a verb but (unlike an independent clause) cannot stand alone as a sentence. -e.g., She said that I don't know what I want Bill to do. Unnecessary and unclear passive construction -A passive construction occurs when you make the object of an action into the subject of a sentence. -e.g., Why was the road crossed by the chicken? Style Issues to Avoid Unnecessary conditionals -The conditional mood of the verb. -e.g., Water boils when it will reach 100 \u00b0C. Idioms -a group of words established by usage as having a meaning not deducible from those of the individual words -e.g., raining cats and dogs STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 3311/14/2016 18 Style Issues to Avoid Too many words between subject and verb -e.g., Farmers that understand the difference between the soil requirements of plants when they are seedlings and their requirements when they are mature are in high demand. Negative stems -e.g., Which organism would not live in a forest ecosystem? Grammar Issues to Avoid Rarefied structures Missing or unclear antecedents -an expression (word, phrase, clause, etc.) that gives its meaning to a pro -form (pronoun, pro - verb, pro -adverb, etc.). Grammatical double negatives Incorrect grammar STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 3411/14/2016 19 Vocabulary to Avoid Inappropriate register -e.g., academic language, language that is too familiar or conversational Unnecessary jargon Long compound nouns and adjectives Gratuitous synonyms Vocabulary to Avoid Words with several meanings Unusual or low -frequency words Dialect and regionalisms Words, phrases, and names with secondary meanings that are sexual or naughty STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 3511/14/2016 20 In Conclusion Questions about Policy for SDE -Record on 3x5 Index Cards in Rooms -Submit to SDE for Answering at Later Time Paperwork -Sign Non -Disclosure & Submit to Room Leader Before Starting -Submit Remaining Paperwork to Cathy Salas Small Group Trainings on How to Use System -Is the next training in this room STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 36SUMMARY OF LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY, BIAS, AND SENSITIVITY GUIDELINES 1. STEREOTYPING Testing materials should not present persons stereotyped according to the following characteristics: Age Disability Gender Race/Ethnicity Sexual orientation 2. SENSITIVE OR CONTROVERSIAL SUBJECTS Controversial or potentially distressing subjects should be avoided or treated sensitively. For example, a passage discussing the historical importance of a battle is acceptable whereas a graphic description of a battle would not be. Controversial subjects include: Death and Disease Gambling* Politics (Current) Race relations Religion Sexuality Superstition War (References to gambling should be avoided in Mathematics items related to probability.) 3. ADVICE Testing materials should not advocate specific lifestyles or behaviors except in the most general or universally agreed upon ways. For example, a recipe for a healthful fruit snack is acceptable but a passage recommending a specific diet is not. The following are categories of advice to be avoided completely: Religion Sexual preference 4. DANGEROUS ACTIVITIES Care should be taken not to present dangerous activities in such a way as to make them seem appealing or acceptable. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 37SUMMARY OF LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY, BIAS, AND SENSITIVITY GUIDELINES 5. POPULATION DIVERSITY, REPRESENTATIVENESS, AND ETHNOCENTRISM Testing materials should: Reflect the diversity of the testing population Use stimulus materials (such as works of literature) produced by members of minority communities Use personal names from different ethnic origin communities Use pictures of people from different ethnic origin communities Avoid ethnocentrism (the attitude that all people should share a particular group's language, beliefs, culture, or religion) 6. DIFFERENTIAL FAMILIARITY: ELITISM AND DIF Specialized concepts and terminology extraneous to the core content of test questions should be avoided. This caveat applies to terminology from the fields of: Construction Finance Sports Law Machinery Military topics Politics Science Technology Agriculture 7. LANGUAGE ACCESSIBILITY Language should be as direct, clear, and inclusive as possible. The following should be avoided or used with care: Passive constructions Idioms Multiple subordinate clauses Pronouns with unclear antecedents Multiple-meaning words Nonstandard grammar Dialect Jargon 8. GRAPHICS All of the relevant foregoing standards apply to graphics.

Consortium: Bias and Sensitivity Guidelines Introduction Purpose The purpose of the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium Bias and Sensitivity Guidelines (hereafter referred to as \"the Guidelines\") is to help ensure that the Smarter Balanced assessments are fair for all groups of test takers, despite differences in characteristics including, but not limited to, disability status, ethnic group, gender, regi onal background, native language, race, religion, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. The goal of fairness in assessment can be approached by ensuring that test materials are as free as possible of unnecessary barriers to the success of diverse groups of test takers. Those unnecessary barriers can be reduced by following some fundamental rules: Do not measure irrelevant knowledge or skill. Do not anger, offend, upset, or otherwise distract test takers. Treat all groups of people with appropriate respect in test materials. This document describes in detail how to follow these rules for the Smarter Balanced assessments of the Common Core State Standards in English language arts and mathematics. Some aspects of the Guidelines , such as the rule dealing with evolution, are not appropriate for tests of specific subjects such as biology or psychology. Uses Though many people think of bias and sensitivity guidelines as applying primarily to the review of test items after they have been written, fairness must be considered in all phases of test development and use. The intended use of the Guidelines is in the development of the Smarter Balanced assessments, particularly in item writing and review. This document describes the rules agreed upon by the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium states for achieving fairness in test content and will help reduce subjectivity in evaluating test items for fairness. Only items that are in compliance with the Guidelines will be included in the Smarter Balanced assessments. The Guidelines will help ensure STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 70that the test content is fair for test takers as well as acceptable to the many stakeholders and constituent groups within the Smarter Balanced states.1 Link to ECD Use of the Guidelines will help the Smarter Balanced assessments comply with Standard 7.4 of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing : Test developers should strive to identify and eliminate language, symbols, words, phrases, and contents that are generally regarded as offensive by members of racial, ethni c, gender, or other groups except when judged to be necessary for adequate representation of the domain (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999, p. 82). The Smarter Balanced assessments are developed using the principles of Evidence-Centered Design (ECD). Thr ee basic elements of ECD are: 1) stating the claims to be made about test takers, 2) deciding what evidence is required to support the claims, and 3) administering test items that provide the required evidence (Mislevy, Steinberg, & Almond, 1999). ECD prov ides a chain of evidence-based reasoning linking test performance to the claims to be made about test takers. Fair assessments are essential to the use of ECD. If the items are not fair, then the evidence they provide means different things for different g roups of test takers. Under those circumstances, the claims cannot be equally well- supported for all test takers. Appropriate use of the Guidelines helps to ensure that the evidence provided by the items means the same thing for various groups of test takers and allows ECD to work as intended. Defining Validity, Bias, Sensitivity, and Fairness Validity To define \"fairness\" and \"bias\" for the purposes of the Guidelines , it is necessary to understand the meaning of \"validity.\" Validity is the extent to which the inferences and actions made on the basis of test scores are appropriate and backed by evidence (Messick, 1989). More simply, validity can be thought of as the extent to which test scores accurately reflect the relevant knowledge and skills of test tak ers. For the Smarter Balanced assessments, the relevant knowledge and skills are defined by the Common Core State Standards. Bias and sensitivity According to the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing , \"bias in tests and testing refers to construct -irrelevant [i.e., invalid] components that result in systematically lower or higher scores for identifiable groups of examinees\" (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999, p. 76). \"Sensitivity\" is used to refer to an awarene ss of the need to avoid bias in assessment. In common usage, reviews of tests for bias and sensitivity are reviews to help ensure that the test items and stimuli are fair for various groups of test takers. Fairness \"Fairness\" is a more difficult word to define because, as indicated in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999, p. 74), \"fairness is used in many different 1 The Consortium is committed to addressing concerns that have been raised regarding some special populations (including indigenous populations and Native Americans) and will continue to collaborate on finding practicable r esolutions to the issues. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 71ways and has no single technical meaning.\" For an extensive discussion of the meanings of \"fairness\" in assessment, see Camilli, 2006. A useful definition of fairness for the purposes of the Guidelines is the extent to which the test scores are valid for different groups of test takers. For example, a math item ma y contain difficult language unrelated to mathematics. If the language interfered about equally with all test takers, validity would be reduced for all test takers, but the item would not necessarily be unfair. If, however, the language were a bigger barrier for students who are not native speakers of English than for other students, then the item would be unfair. Even if the items are more difficult for some groups of students than for other groups of students, the items may not necessarily be unfair. For example, if an item were intended to measure the ability to comprehend a reading passage in English, score differences between groups based on real differences in comprehension of English would be valid and, therefore, fair. As Cole and Zieky (2001, p. 37 5) noted, \"If the members of the measurement community currently agree on any aspect of fairness, it is that score differences alone are not proof of bias.\" Fairness does not require that all groups have the same average scores. Fairness requires any exist ing differences in scores to be valid. An item would be unfair if the source of the difficulty were not a valid aspect of the item. For example, an item would be unfair if members of a group of test takers were distracted by an aspect of the item that they found highly offensive. But if the difference in difficulty reflected real and relevant differences in the group's level of mastery of the tested Common Core State Standards, the item would be fair. Judgmental and Empirical Evaluations of Fairness Judgmen tal evaluations No quantitative indicator of fairness can replace human judgment in evaluations of fairness. Issues that may affect fairness are often too subtle to be captured by any statistic. Therefore, the first line of defense against the inclusion of unfair materials in the Smarter Balanced assessments is the judgment of trained test developers who follow these Guidelines. Judges may, however, miss potential fairness issues that sophisticated statistical analyses later find (Bond, 1993). Therefore, both judgmental and statistical evaluations of fairness are required. Empirical evaluations In addition to judgmental reviews for fairness, items in the Smarter Balanced assessments receive an empirical check for fairness. Items in the assessments are field tested to see how well they work before they are used to evaluate students. At that stage, a statistic called Differential Item Functioning (DIF) is used as a statistical indicator of fairness. DIF studies are required by Standard 7.3 of the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA, APA, & NCME, 1999, p. 81). Merely calculating differences between groups in the difficulty of items is not a useful indicator of fairness because the differences may be valid. That is, the groups may actually di ffer on relevant knowledge that is supposed to be measured by the item. Though the statistics involved may be considered complicated, DIF is based on the straightforward concept that people who know the same amount about a subject should perform similarly on test items concerning that subject, regardless of differences in such factors as gender or race. Deciding which people know the same amount is most often done on the basis of test scores. People with the same or very similar scores are considered to be \"matched.\" Significant differences in the difficulties of test items for matched people in different groups result in elevated values of the DIF statistic. DIF alone, however, is not proof of bias. No test is perfect. Therefore, no matching of test takers on the basis of test scores can be perfect. A fair item may show DIF merely because the test scores STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 72have not matched people well on the particular knowledge or skill validly measured by the item. (See Holland & Thayer, 1988; Dorans, 1989; and Zieky, 1993, for more information about DIF and its uses in test development.) Combinations of evaluations Neither DIF nor any other statistic can be considered proof that an item is either fair or biased, but appropriate statistics can help identify any potentially un fair items. Using a combination of judgmental reviews and statistical data on the performances of matched test takers in different groups is the best method available to help ensure the fairness of the Smarter Balanced assessments. Proper Balance in Interp reting the Guidelines An overly zealous interpretation of the Guidelines can be as harmful as an overly lax interpretation. Critics have responded very negatively to what they consider the excesses of some bias and sensitivity reviews. For example, with re spect to what she considered rampant over-generalizations of bias and sensitivity guidelines, Diane Ravitch (2003, p. 4) wrote, \"What began with admirable intentions has evolved into an increasingly broad and increasingly bizarre policy of censorship that has gone far beyond its original scope.\" The position of the Consortium and other professionals in the field of measurement is that, when done appropriately, bias and sensitivity reviews are not a \"bizarre policy of censorship\" but are instead a sincere at tempt to make fair and valid tests. It is not true that anything that anybody might possibly object to in test materials is necessarily judged to be unfair. In fact, one purpose of using written guidelines such as the ones in this document is to limit overly broad, idiosyncratic judgments about the fairness of test materials. There must be a balance between striving to ensure fairness and the ability to measure the full range of the Common Core State Standards with authentic and interesting materials. Prope r use of the Guidelines will help maintain that balance. Issues Often Confused with Fairness Difficulty of items The difficulty of items should not be confused with fairness. A difficult item is not necessarily unfair if the sources of difficulty are valid . For example, the Common Core State Standards call for students to read documents important in the history of the United States. Some of those documents are difficult to read, and valid items will appropriately reflect that difficulty. Overextending guidelines Reviewers should avoid overextending the Guidelines to contrive situations in which an innocuous topic is judged to be unfair. That practice inappropriately limits test content because any topic can be judged to be potentially upsetting in some set of circumstances for some test takers. For example, a reviewer might say that an innocuous depiction of a mother with her child might upset a test taker who is an orphan. A topic that is upsetting on its face is probably unfair, but an innocuous topic that might possibly be upsetting for some atypical test taker(s) under some particular set of circumstances is not necessarily unfair. Content and Language that Is Fair to Include in Smarter Balanced Assessments STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 73Fairness of content With respect to the validity and fairness of the Smarter Balanced assessments, any content that is required by the Common Core State Standards, consistent with the Consortium's item specifications guidelines and reviewed through the processes described by the Consortium's item review procedures, may be included in the Smarter Balanced assessments. In addition, state laws and state policies in one or more of the states may also affect the content of the assessments that states present to their students. For example, a state law may require the inclusion of content based on the achievements of specific groups. Any content required by state law or state policy may be administered during the same test event as a Smarter Balanced assessment but will need to conform to the Consortium 's policies regarding the addition of state -specific content. These policies may include, at a minimum, the ability to derive a score that excludes the additional state content such that a comparable score may be reported for all students taking a Smarter Balanced assessment. Exposure to information Stimuli for English language arts items have to be about some topic. Mathematics problems are often placed in real -world contexts. The Common Core State Standards cover only mathematics and English language arts . They do not include all of the content areas from which topics and contexts must be drawn. Which topics and contexts are fair to include in the Smarter Balanced assessments? One fairness concern is that students differ in exposure to information through their life experiences outside of school. For example, some students experience snow every winter, and some have never experienced snow. Some students swim in the ocean every summer, and some have never seen an ocean. Some students live in houses, some live in apartments, some live in mobile homes, and some are homeless. Even though curricula differ, the concepts to which students are exposed in school tend to be much more similar than are their life experiences outside of school. If students have become f amiliar with concepts through exposure to them in the classroom, the use of those concepts as topics and contexts in test materials is fair, even if some students have not been exposed to the concepts through their life experiences. For example, a student in grade 4 should know what an ocean is through classroom exposure to the concept, even if he or she has never actually seen an ocean. A student does not have to live in a house to know what a house is, if there has been classroom exposure to the term. Sim ilarly, a student does not have to be able to run in a race to know what a race is. Mention of snow does not make an item unacceptable for students living in warmer parts of the country if they have been exposed to the concept of snow in school. Informatio n in the stimulus A major purpose of reading is to learn about new things. Therefore, it is fair to include material that may be unfamiliar to students if the information necessary to answer the items is included in the tested material. For example, it is fair to test the ability of a student who has never been in a desert to comprehend an appropriate reading passage about a desert, as long as the information about deserts needed to respond to the items is found in the passage. Students with disabilities A similar issue arises for students with disabilities. Is it fair to include material about the visual arts or music for students who cannot experience them directly? Is it fair to include passages about physical activities for students who cannot participat e in them? As noted above, it is acceptable to include material that may be unfamiliar to some students through life experiences, as long as the information necessary to answer the items is included in the stimuli or is part of the information STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 74expected fro m classroom exposure. For students with certain disabilities, it is necessary to add the provision that the information necessary to answer the items does not need to be obtained through direct, personal experience. For example, a high school student who i s deaf could fairly be expected to know what a bell is, but could not fairly be expected to know what a bell sounds like. English language learners Unnecessarily difficult language can be a source of unfairness when the language itself is not the focus of measurement. This is particularly true for English language learners. The language in mathematics items should not be a barrier to a correct answer for people who could do the required mathematics. For mathematics assessments, therefore, nonmathematical l anguage should be targeted no higher than the grade level below the tested grade level. For English language arts (ELA) assessments, the focus is on the use of language. Valid assessment of the ELA Common Core State Standards requires the use of language t argeted at the tested grade level. In general, when the language itself is not being tested, the clearest language consistent with validity should be used. For more detail on appropriate language for English language learners, see the Smarter Balanced Asse ssment Consortium Accessibility Guidelines for English Language Learners (2012). Barriers to Fairness Fairness review is intended to remove barriers to valid measurement that may affect different groups of test takers in different ways. There are three major types of barriers related to fairness. Barriers related to invalid knowledge Barriers related to invalid knowledge occur when uncommon information \u2014not reasonably expected of some group(s) of students and not related to the Common Core State Standards \u2014is required to answer a test item. For example, assuming a student knows what a \"foyer\" is would be unfair because the term: 1) is more likely to be known by some groups of students than by other groups of students, 2) is not required by the Common Core Sta te Standards, and 3) is not likely to have been routinely used in the classroom. Barriers related to emotional reactions Barriers related to emotional reactions may occur if language or images cause strong emotional reactions among members of some groups o f test takers and those reactions potentially interfere with test performance. For example, if a passage advocates for one position of a controversial issue such as gun control, a student who is a strong supporter of the opposite position may be disadvanta ged by having to put his or her beliefs aside to respond correctly to items. Even if the performances of students are not directly affected, the presence of offensive, inflammatory, controversial, upsetting, or disrespectful material in tests will lower th e confidence of students, parents, politicians, educators, and other community members in the test. Barriers related to physical abilities Barriers related to physical abilities occur if test takers have difficulty seeing or hearing the test materials or have physical difficulty responding to the test under standard conditions (e.g., manipulating a computer mouse). The Consortium uses the principles of Universal Design (Thompson, Johnstone, & Thurlow, 2002) to help reduce physical barriers to valid measurement, but some accommodations for students with disabilities and modifications to test materials will still be necessary. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 75The Consortium has decided that accessibility concerns are best conveyed in a separate document. See the Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium General Accessibility Guidelines (2012) for information about how to ensure that the Smarter Balanced assessments are as accessible as possible for all students, including students with disabilities. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 76 Avoidance of Invalid Knowledge It is necessar y to avoid unfair barriers to success based on group differences in knowledge unrelated to the purpose of the test. Requiring specialized invalid knowledge to answer a test item is unfair. For example, requiring prior knowledge of the number of people on a soccer team to answer an item in the Smarter Balanced assessments is unfair because people who know the valid content may not have the invalid knowledge of soccer needed to answer the item. (Note that testing specialized knowledge is appropriate when that knowledge is valid. Requiring knowledge about the number of people on a soccer team may be perfectly appropriate on a physical education test.) This guideline prohibits the testing of specialized knowl edge when that knowledge is not relevant to the purpose of the test. Specialized knowledge that is explained in the stimulus material or can be inferred by contextual clues is acceptable, however, if the understanding of such explanations or the making of such inferences is supposed to be tested. The following topics have been common sources of specialized invalid knowledge in tests like the Smarter Balanced assessments. Familiarity with these topics and other similarly specialized knowledge \u2014when unrelated to the purpose of the test \u2014should not be required to answer items, unless the necessary information is provided in the stimulus material . Regionalisms Avoid requiring knowledge of words and phenomena limited to a region or certain regions of the country and words that carry different meanings in different regions (e.g., \"hero\" for \"sandwich,\" \"snow days\" at school, \"tonic\" or an article of clothing, \"bubbler\" for \"water fountain.\") Religion Avoid requiring knowledge of any particular religion. For example, to say that something is \"as colorful as an Easter egg\" may be an unfamiliar comparison for some students. Occupationa l and technical information Avoid requiring knowledge of specialized information and terminology \u2014not related to the purpose of the test\u2014 that is associated with a particular occupation or field of knowledge such as agriculture, law, mechanics, military, science, sports, technology, transportation, or weapons. For example, avoid requiring irrelevant knowledge of the purpose of a silo, the less common names for tools, the chain of command in military organizations, the functions of parts of weapons, the scorin g systems or rules of play in various sports, the uses of a flange, or the meaning of \"lumen.\" The point at which words become too specialized is a matter of judgment and will vary with the grade level of the students who are being tested. The best judges of the appropriateness of words associated with a particular field of knowledge are experienced teachers of students at the tested grade level. Idioms Avoid requiring understanding of idioms and figures of speech unless understanding them is called for by the Common Core State Standards , as in some English language arts items (e.g., spill the beans, hit the hay, fly in the ointment, flash in the pan). STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 77 Topics to Avoid Certain topics are extremely controversial, upsetting, inflammatory, and often judged by parents and communities to be inappropriate for children. Such topics should be excluded from the Smarter Balanced assessments unless required to measure the Common Core State Standards. The goal is to avoid material that may cause extreme negative emot ions in test takers because such emotions have the potential to interfere with test performance. It is best not to include materials that may cause strong negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, hatred, or sadness. The following list is intended t o indicate the nature of topics that should be excluded from Smarter Balanced assessments, but the list is not exhaustive. Current events may add topics that are so problematic that they should be excluded from the assessments. Topics to be avoided include , for example: abortion abuse of people or animals contraception deportation of immigrants experimentation on people or animals that is dangerous or painful killing of animals for sport the occult, witches, ghosts, vampires pregnancy of human beings rape sexual behavior or sexual innuendo suicide torture Other issues have become so sensitive that the topics are difficult to treat in a way that does not cause fairness problems. It is safest not to include topics such as the following in Smarter Balanc ed assessments: euthanasia gun control climate change caused by human behavior prayer in school current or recent partisan political issues, ethnic conflicts, and religious disputes STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 78 Topics to Be Treated with Care Other sensitive but less upsetting topi cs may be included in Smarter Balanced assessments. Such topics must, however, be treated carefully to minimize potential fairness issues. Guidelines that forbid a topic are easy to apply. Guidelines that require treating a topic with care are more difficult to apply because different people will have different opinions about what is acceptable. When making judgments about the suitability of materials on topics such as those listed below, it is important to keep in mind that t he Smarter Balanced assessments must not only be fair and valid for test takers, they must also appear to be fair and valid in the opinions of various constituencies within the Consortium. It is counterproductive to use test materials that various groups within the Consortium will consi der inappropriate for their children. Accidents and natural disasters Mention of these topics or general, objective discussions may be acceptable, but avoid a focus on suffering, destruction, or graphic, gruesome details that may upset or frighten students. Advocacy The Smarter Balanced assessments should not support one side on a controversial issue unless it is necessary to do so for validity, as in presenting an argument for test takers to evaluate. Avoid advocacy when possible because test takers with opposite views may be disadvantaged. If, however, advocacy is required to measure a Common Core State Standard, indicate that the material does not necessarily represent the views of the Consortium. Do not use brand names to avoid the impression that the Consortium is advocating use of a particular brand. Avoid advocating for or against a political party unless doing so is important to measure a Common Core State Standard. Alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs The goal is to avoid giving any impression of approval of these substances. It is best to avoid depictions of people using these substances. In particular, do not depict use of these substances as pleasurable, alluring, or as signs of sophistication and maturity. Warnings against the use of these substances may be acceptable for students in middle or high school. Animals that are frightening to children Younger students are more likely to be upset by certain dangerous animals than are older students. Depictions of spiders and poisonous snakes have been cited as causing problems for some children and are best avoided. Obje ctive depictions of a food chain or nonthreatening descriptions of animals are acceptable, but avoid depicting predators engaged in violent, threatening behavior. For example, a discussion of how members of a wolf pack interact with each other is likely to be acceptable. A depiction of a wolf ripping the entrails from a fawn or attacking a child should be avoided. Antisocial, criminal, or inappropriate behaviors (e.g., bullying, cheating, cutting school, joining gangs, fighting, lying, stealing). One goal i s to avoid modeling inappropriate or bad behavior for students. It is particularly important to avoid making such behavior appear to be attractive, fun, glamorous, sophisticated, or something to be emulated. Another goal is to avoid upsetting students who may have been the victims of such behavior by others. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 79 Biographical materials Take care in selecting biographical materials. Some biographical materials may be controversial because different groups of people may view the individuals depicted very differently. For example, one group's heroic freedom fighter is another group's cowardly terrorist. A possible concern with the use of biographical material about living people is that a person who is widely admired at the time he or she is included in test mater ials may become involved in a highly publicized scandal before the test is administered. Dancing Allow all forms of dance except couples social dancing, which is the type most likely to draw criticism from some groups. Dangerous activities The goal is to avoid modeling behaviors that are inherently dangerous and making dangerous behaviors appear to be attractive, fun, glamorous, or something to be emulated. Particularly for younger children, avoid showing potentially dangerous behavior such as running away from home, going with strangers, or using dangerous tools or weapons without supervision, even if all turns out well. Common actions that are dangerous if done improperly (such as crossing the street, riding a bicycle, hiking, or swimming) are acceptable if depicted as being done properly. Describing dangerous substances or devices such as weapons, poisons, or explosives in ways that make them appear attractive or safe is not acceptable. Death and dying Detailed depictions of the death of parents, siblings, contemporaries, and family pets should be avoided unless necessary to measure a Common Core State standard. It is acceptable to mention death (e.g., Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., died in 1968), but it is not acceptable to depict gruesome details. Evolution Evolution of human beings or similarity of human beings to other primates should be avoided as highly controversial for some groups. Evolution within a species (such as evolution of bacteria to withstand antibiotics) is much less problematic and could be allowed if treated with care. Fossils and the age of Earth are acceptable if not linked to evolution of human beings. (In tests intended to measure knowledge of science, any aspect of evolution required for validity is acceptable.) Family problems The goal is to avoid upsetting test takers with detailed descriptions of serious family problems such as the loss of a job, divorce, or serious illness of a parent or sibling, except as needed in historical or literary materials to measure Common Core State Standa rds. Gambling Instruments used for gambling such as playing cards and dice may be used as required in math problems, but do not assume that all students will be familiar with them and will know such things as the number of cards in a deck or the maximum number obtainabl e on a pair of dice. Depictions of people gambling for fun or profit should be avoided. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 80 Holidays and birthdays Not all test takers will be familiar with every religious or quasi -religious holiday (e.g., Halloween). Not all test takers celebrate birthday s. Mention of holidays and birthdays is acceptable as long as all of the information necessary to answer items is included in the stimulus material. The general need to avoid religious materials would argue against extended discussion of religious holidays . Homelessness and evictions These topics may be upsetting to students, particularly those who have direct experience with them or fear having a future experience with them. If the inclusion of any of these topics is important to measure a Common Core State Standard, the topic must be treated factually rather than emotionally and must not focus on anguish and distress. Immigration Immigration has become very controversial. If the inclusion of the topic is important to measure a Common Core State Standard, the topic must be treated factually and objectively. Junk food The goal is to avoid modeling unhealthy behavior by showing excessive consumption of junk food or the selection of junk food in preference to more healthful food. However, it is acceptable to mention eating a cookie, for example, or to use the sharing of a pie to illustrate a fraction. Luxuries The goal is to avoid elitism and the impression that ordinary people are excluded from the test materials. However, test materials do not have to be limited to what is affordable by the least affluent of families. Luxuries such as servants, mansions, and yachts should be avoided except as needed in literary or historical materials to measure the Common Core State Standards. Avoid more common luxuries such as ski trips and private tennis lessons. Avoid depicting expenditures that most people would consider excessive. For example, in a math item, do not have a man purchase three suits at $1500 per suit. Medicines, including diet supplements Treatments for se rious illnesses may be upsetting to some students and should be avoided. Do not model the use of drugs, even prescription drugs, as a way to solve problems. Some groups are opposed to medical treatment, so it is best to avoid the topic unless it is important for the measurement of a Common Core State Standard. Obesity and body -image problems The goal is to avoid upsetting children who depart from the norm in height, weight, or other physical attributes with negative depictions of people who depart from the physical norm. A wide range of body types should be represented in any pictorial material, but stereotypes and negative depictions of people with atypical body shapes should be avoided. Personal questions Items must not invade the privacy of students by a sking them to divulge personal or family issues such as religion, political preference, or antisocial or criminal behavior. For example, do not use an item that asks a test taker to describe a time when he or she was caught doing something wrong. It STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 81is bes t to avoid constructed -response items that require students to reveal how they would act in situations contrary to their beliefs about appropriate behavior. Religion Religion was cited previously as a source of information that is not common to all student s. Religion is cited here as a topic best treated with great care in Smarter Balanced assessments. Some people will see even an objective description of a religion as proselytizing. However, it is acceptable to mention religion. For example, mentioning tha t Buddhism is one of the main religions in Singapore is acceptable. Going into detail about the practices of adherents of Buddhism is not acceptable. In particular, avoid praising or criticizing the practices of a religion. Also avoid references to God, euphemisms for God, or Creationism except in historical or literary documents important for the measurement of the Common Core State Standards. Serious illnesses Serious illnesses include mental as well as physical illnesses. Illnesses that primarily affect certain groups, such as some genetic diseases, may be particularly problematic. Mention of serious illnesses may be acceptable, but avoid a focus on suffering or graphic, gruesome details that may upset students. Slavery This topic may be included in historical or literary documents if important for the measurement of the Common Core State Standards. A focus on graphic, upsetting aspects of slavery should be avoided. Terrorism, wars, violence, suffering These topics may be included in historical or literary documents if important to measure the Common Core State Standards. A focus on graphic, upsetting, or frightening aspects of the topics should be avoided. Avoidance of Stereotypes Materials in Smarter Balanced assessments should not reinforce stereotypes. It is acceptable to show traditional behavior (e.g., a woman caring for children), but traditional behaviors must be balanced by depictions of nontraditional behaviors to avoid reinforcing stereotypes. For adaptive tests (assembled by computer as they are administered to a student), balance is best handled at the level of the item pool. To help ensure that the pool is balanced, item writers should produce items showing nontraditional behaviors whenever they produce items showing traditional behaviors that could be considered stereotyped. All types of stereotypes should be avoided, but the following types have been particularly problematic: Stereotyped language Representations of dialect are not acceptable unless in historic al or literary material important for the measurement of a Common Core State Standard. Phrases such as \"man -sized job,\" or \"Dutch uncle\" should be avoided. Language that uses different terms for the same characteristic in men and women is not acceptable. F or example, it is not appropriate to label a man as \"forceful\" or \"assertive\" and a woman as \"pushy\" or \"controlling\" for exhibiting the same behavior. Language that assumes all members of a profession are one gender is unacceptable (e.g., use \"sales repre sentative\" instead of \"salesman,\" \"firefighter\" instead of \"fireman,\" \"mail carrier\" instead of STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 82\"mailman\"). Some stereotyped language may be acceptable in literary or historical material important for the measurement of a Common Core State Standard. Stereo typed images Avoid stereotyped images. For example, do not show all girls in frilly dresses and all boys in jeans. Do not show all White men in suits and ties and all Black men dressed as laborers. If it is impossible to show diversity in a single image, diversity should be shown across images. Stereotyped social/occupational roles There should be a mix of genders and races shown in any social or occupational role. For example, do not depict all male doctors with all female nurses. Do not show all Black wor kers with all White bosses. If it is impossible to show diversity in a single item, diversity should be shown across items. Stereotyped behaviors and characteristics Do not treat all members of a gender, sexual orientation, racial, ethnic, national, or other such group as though they all share the same characteristic. For example, do not depict all Native American people as close to nature or all Asian American students as smart . It is particularly important to avoid offensive stereotypes of any such group. For example, do not portray any such group as more (or less) lazy, immoral, primitive, ignorant, prone to crime, gullible, violent, miserly, arrogant, or dirty than any other such group. Appropriate Labels for Groups It is very important to avoid derogato ry labels for any group. Whenever possible, use the label that the group prefers. History has shown that the following groups have often been mislabeled. African American people Use \"Black\" or \"African American.\" Do not use \"Negro\" or \"Colored\" except in t he names of institutions, or in historical or literary material important for the measurement of the Common Core State Standards. Asian American people When possible, use specific terms such as \"Japanese American\" or \"Chinese American.\" Terms such as \"Paci fic Island American ,\" \"Native Hawaiian ,\" and \"Asian/Pacific Island American\" should be used as appropriate. Do not use the word \"Oriental\" to refer to people except in historical or literary material important for the measurement of the Common Core State S tandards. People with disabilities Put the person before the disability. For example, use \"a person who is blind\" rather than \"a blind person.\" In general, avoid using adjectives as nouns for people with disabilities (e.g., \"the blind\" or \"the deaf\") excep t in the names of organizations or in literary or historical material important for measurement of the Common Core State Standards. Avoid euphemisms such as \"challenged.\" Use objective language rather than emotionally loaded terms (e.g., \"uses a wheelchair \" rather than \"confined to a wheelchair\"). Do not depict people with disabilities, including people with learning disabilities and people with developmental disabilities, as helpless victims. Terms to be avoided include \"dumb\" for a person who is mute , \"handicapped\" for a person with a disability, and \"retarded\" for a person with a cognitive disability. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 83Latino/Latina American people The terms \"Latino American\" (for men) and \"Latina American\" (for women) are acceptable. The term \"Hispanic American\" is also acceptable. When appropriate for the context, it is preferable to use specific group names such as \"Cuban American,\" \"Dominican American,\" and \"American Indian\" are both acceptable. When possible, use specific names for peoples such as \"Pequot\" or \"Mohegan.\" Some Native Americans prefer the words \"nation\" or \"people\" to the word \"tribe.\" Older people It is best to refer to older people by specific ages or age ranges. Minimize the use of euphemi sms such as \"seniors.\" Women and men The primary rule is to use parallel terms for men and women. For example, do not use titles for men and first names for women, as in \"Dr. Sanchez and his wife, Juanita.\" Do not refer to women as \"wives\" unless men are referred to as \"husbands\" in the same context. Do not refer to women by physical attributes and to men by accomplishments as in \"the successful lawyer and his beautiful wife.\" Do not refer to males as \"men\" and women of similar ages as \"girls.\" Do not use the generic \"he\" or \"man\" to refer to all human beings. Historical or literary material important for the measurement of the Common Core State Standards is acceptable even if it uses outmoded terms and nonparallel language for women and men. Representation of Diversity There should be representations of different groups in the pool of items so tests built from the pool will, on average, be appropriately balanced. In items and stimuli that mention people, the following conditions are required in the pool of items and should be reflected in assig nments to item writers: Males and females should be approximately equally represented. People who are members of what are traditionally considered to be minority groups must be represented. People of different ages, physical abilities, and social classes s hould be depicted. A wide variety of life situations, living conditions, types of housing, types of families (including single -parent families) , regions, and the like should be depicted. A Final Word Neither this nor any other set of guidelines can cover a ll of the possible variations in content that will have to be evaluated for fairness in the Smarter Balanced assessments. Current events (e.g., natural disasters, issues raised during political campaigns, terrorist attacks) can add new topics that may caus e fairness problems. Issues that were neutral may become controversial. If the specific guidelines do not offer sufficient guidance in some particular situation, the best practice is to turn to the fundamental rules and ask: Do the items measure any irrele vant knowledge or skill? If so, will some group(s) be more greatly affected than others? STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 84 Will any aspect of the test materials anger, offend, upset, or otherwise distract test takers? If so, will some group(s) be more greatly affected than others? Do the t est materials treat all groups of people with respect? If not, will some group(s) be more greatly offended than others? If some group(s) will be more greatly affected than others, a potential fairness problem exists. The next step is to determine whether o r not the potential problem is a real one. Has difficulty been confused with fairness? Has a guideline been overgeneralized? Has a \"treat carefully\" guideline been interpreted as a \"must avoid\" guideline? Has a situation been contrived to make innocuous content seem unfair? Is the material important for valid measurement of the Common Core State Standards? Finally, it is important to keep in mind that the intent of using the Guidelines is to remove unnecessary barriers to the success of diverse groups of test takers. Some potential barriers, such as difficult language in an ELA stimulus based on historical documents, may be necessary to allow valid measurement of the Common Core State Standards and are acceptable.

STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 87 Appendix Examples of Acceptable and Unacceptable Test Materials Following are excerpts from test items and stimuli. Some of the excerpts illustrate various violations of the guidelines. Others illustrate items that are acceptable in terms of fairness. Math problems The first set of examples consists of math problems or excerpts from math problems. Note the tension between adding realistic context to a math problem and a voiding linguistic complexity and irrelevant knowledge requirements. 1. The drawing below shows a roof truss. Highlight the two triangles that are congruent with each other. a. Unacceptable. Few children are likely to be familiar with a roof truss, and knowledge of a roof truss is not related to the purpose of the question. 2. In the drawing below, highlight the two triangles that are congruent with each other. a. Acceptable. The reading load is reduced, and there is no unfamiliar context. 3. Shaquan helps assemble food p ackages for poor people at Christmas. Each box holds 6 cans in a row. There is room for 4 rows in a box. Write the expression that best describes the number of cans in one full box. a. Unacceptable. The first sentence adds to the reading load of a math questi on but adds no useful information. The references to \"Christmas\" and \"poor people\" are inappropriate and unnecessary. 4. Two people who were conversing at a street corner parted and moved away from the corner in straight lines that are perpendicular to each other. If one person walked at 3 miles per hour and the second person jogged at 4 miles per hour, how far apart would they be after one hour? a. Unacceptable. The linguistic load is high for a math question. The sentences are long, and the syntax is complicat ed. \"Conversing\" is a difficult synonym for \"talking,\" and the people's actions before they started to move are not relevant in any case. (\"Perpendicular\" is acceptable as a valid mathematical term.) 5. Two people stood next to each other. They started walking in straight lines that are perpendicular to each other. One person walked at 3 miles per hour. The other person walked at 4 miles per hour. How far apart are they after one hour? a. Acceptable. Unnecessary information has been deleted. Two long sentences have been replaced by five shorter sentences. The conditional syntax (\"If one person. . .\") has been replaced by brief statements of fact. 6. A modem can send X bits per second. Write the expression that shows how many seconds it would take to send Y bits. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 88a. Unacceptable. The mention of a \"modem\" and \"bits\" is irrelevant and is likely to be unfamiliar. A student might skip the item or waste time wondering what \"bits\" are or what a \"modem\" is. 7. Lee can walk X miles an hour. Write the expression that shows how many hours it would take Lee to walk Y miles. a. Acceptable. The context is familiar. 8. If one card is taken at random from a deck of playing cards, what is the probability that the card will be an ace? a. Unacceptable. The question assumes knowledge of the number of aces and the total number of cards in a deck of playing cards. It is acceptable to ask about probability, and it is acceptable to use playing cards in math problems. According to the guideline about gambling, however, it is not acceptable to assume that t est takers have knowledge of the characteristics of a deck of playing cards. 9. There are 4 aces in a deck of 52 playing cards . If one card is taken at random from the deck, what is the probability that the card will be an ace? a. Acceptable. No knowledge of the characteristics of a deck of cards is required to answer the item. 10. When Ms. Luna pulled her car into the parking garage, the machine at the gate issued a ticket stamped with the time, 11:30 a.m. When she left the garage that afternoon, her ticket was stam ped with the time she left, 12:15 p.m. What was the total length of time that Ms. Luna's car was in the parking garage? a. Unacceptable. The question is very wordy and uses an unfamiliar context for many children. In addition, \"pulled her car\" is an idiom that children may not know. 11. Sandip went to the library at 11:30 in the morning. He left at 12:15 that afternoon. How long did Sandip stay in the library? a. Acceptable. The reading load is reduced, and the context is familiar. 12. It takes Sarah an average of 30 mi nutes to clean her bedroom. She cleans her bedroom once a week. How many hours would Sarah spend cleaning her bedroom in one year? Acceptability depends on the mix of items in the test. a. Unacceptable if many questions in the test had girls cleaning rooms or doing what was traditionally considered \"woman's work,\" because the test would reinforce a stereotype and be unfair. b. Acceptable if combined with questions showing women doing nontraditional work. Not all children have their own bedrooms, but the concept that some children have individual bedrooms should be neither strange nor upsetting. Whether or not the required knowledge of the number of minutes in an hour and the number of weeks in a year is fair depends on the grade level of the test takers. 13. According to the graph, the number of unemployed workers was highest in which year? a. Acceptable. The mere mention of unemployed workers is acceptable. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 89 14. Marisa hit the bull's -eye with her rifle 7 times out of 9 shots. What percent of the time did Marisa hit the bull's -eye? a. Unacceptable. Students who are not familiar with the phrase \"bull's -eye\" in the context of a target will have a rather gruesome mental picture of Marisa's shooting. The use of guns tends to be controversial in any case. 15. The data tables below s how how long a driver will be impaired based on the consumption of 1, 2, or 3 ounces of alcohol within one hour. Use the data to predict the amount of time a driver will be impaired after consuming 4 or 5 ounces of alcohol in one hour. Explain your reasoni ng for obtaining the predicted values. a. Unacceptable . A brief item concerning alcohol might be acceptable in the higher grades in the context of showing impairment, but basing an entire performance item on the topic is excessive. Also, showing consumption of more than 1 or 2 drinks per hour models inappropriate or even dangerous behavior. 16. A pizza is cut into 8 slices. If 5 girls eat one slice each, how many slices will be left? a. Acceptable. One slice of pizza is not excessive consumption of junk food. Excerp ts from stimuli for English language arts The next set of examples consists of brief excerpts from ELA stimuli. 1. Wagner used the orchestra to achieve certain effects in much the same way that other composers of operas used the singers. a. Acceptable if the knowledge needed to answer the questions was included in the passage. The mere mention of opera or a composer does not make the excerpt unfair. b. Unacceptable if understanding the passage required knowledge of opera and how composers \"used\" the orchestra or \"used\" singers. 2. The African Americans living in Middletown tended to be part of households consisting of extended families living together. a. Acceptable. The statement of fact about a particular group of African American people is acceptable and doe s not reinforce a stereotype. 3. Cyanide is one of the fastest -acting poisons known to science. a. Unacceptable. The excerpt violates the guideline about avoiding dangerous actions and substances. Parents are likely to oppose including information about lethal substances in the test. 4. The AIDS epidemic, which has devastated some countries in sub -Saharan Africa, has affected children as well as adults, leaving many children not only orphaned and uncared for, but also malnourished, diseased, and close to death. a. Unacceptable. Excessive detail about the suffering of children makes the excerpt unacceptable. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 905. Harlow was best known for the experiment in which he separated infant monkeys from their mothers shortly after the infants were born. a. Unacceptable. The excerpt v iolates the guideline that prohibits inclusion of painful or harmful experimentation. The excerpt would be acceptable in a psychology test, however. 6. I love to make videos! I use the camera in my phone to capture my friends having a good time with their dates at parties and at school dances. a. Unacceptable. Owning a cell phone with video capabilities is currently a luxury beyond the reach of many test takers. The references to \"dates\" and \"dances\" are not in compliance with the guideline concerning social dancing. 7. An ancestor of the modern horse the size of a dog gave rise to progressively larger species. a. Acceptable. The passage concerns the evolution of horses, which is in compliance with the guideline that identifies the evolution of human beings as the asp ect of evolution to avoid. 8. The Japanese immigrants enrolled in Ms. Kubota's class worked very hard. a. Acceptable. The reference is to a particular group of Japanese immigrants, so it does not stereotype all Japanese immigrants. 9. The amount of caffeine in a c up of coffee can still affect the human body more than three hours after it has been ingested. a. Acceptable. The mention of caffeine appears to be in an objective discussion of the effects of drinking coffee and would be in compliance with the guideline on harmful substances, if the passage did not encourage the drinking of coffee. 10. People who drive gas -guzzling SUVs contribute to global warming. a. Unacceptable. This excerpt is a clear violation of the guideline against advocating for one side in a controversial situation. 11. In the 17th century, many convicted criminals were hanged, but some were slowly crushed to death. a. Unacceptable. Death by slow crushing is clearly out of compliance with the guidelines about death and suffering. 12. A large influx of immigrants will destroy the equilibrium of a neighborhood. a. Unacceptable. The negative view of immigrants in the excerpt makes it out of compliance with the guideline forbidding offensive stereotypes of any group. The verb \"destroy\" is particularly harsh in that context. 13. There has been an increase in the number of people who identify themselves as American Indians. a. Acceptable. Either \"American Indian\" or \"Native American\" is appropriate. The fact that more people than before identify themselves as American Indians is not a fairness problem. 14. Surprisingly, a girl won the math contest. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 91a. Unacceptable. By expressing surprise that a girl won the math contest, the excerpt reinforces the stereotype that girls have less quantitative ability than boys. 15. The soldiers and their wive s attended the ceremony. a. Unacceptable. Unless the reference is to a previously specified group of all male soldiers, refer to \"the soldiers and their spouses\" to avoid the implication that only males are soldiers. 16. ...that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights... a. Acceptable. In spite of the use of \"men\" to refer to all people and in spite of the reference to God, the excerpt is acceptable because it is from an important historical document of the type required by the Common Core State Standards. 17. Bridges with steel frames are more likely to survive an earthquake than are stone bridges. a. Acceptable. The mention of a natural disaster is acceptable. There is no focus on death and destruction. 18. Lee's fath er and Juan's father are both policemen. a. Unacceptable. Even though both officers are male, \"police officers\" is preferred to \"policemen\" to avoid the impression that only men are police officers. 19. The ancient Romans played handball and engaged in other spo rts while nude in the public baths. a. Unacceptable. Though unintended, \"engaged in other sports while nude\" could be taken as sexual innuendo. 20. Many of the people in the United States who speak Spanish come from Mexico. a. Acceptable. The excerpt is a statement of fact and is not a violation of any guideline. 21. He be at work... a. Unacceptable. The use of dialect is stereotyped language and is in violation of the guideline unless it is important to measure a Common Core State Standard in literary or historical material. 22. The men's room is on the right; the girls' room is on the left. a. Unacceptable . Parallel language would call for \"women\" to match \"men\" or \"boy\" to match \"girl.\" 23. Some Native Americans claim to be members of the Algonquian tribe, but according to anthropologists, \"Algonquian\" i s a general term applied to many Native American peoples who speak related languages, not the name of any particular tribe. a. Unacceptable. There is a problem in that the academic definition of \"Algonquian\" is taken as correct, but the usage of Native Americans about themselves is taken as incorrect. The excerpt is out of compliance with the guideline to call people what they prefer to be called. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 92 24. Frederick Douglass, the great African American abolitionist, was said to be born on Valentine's Day. a. Acceptable. The excerpt requires no knowledge of how or why Valen tine's Day is celebrated, nor any agreement that it should be celebrated. 25. Edward Said and Daniel Barenboim cofounded a children's orchestra. a. Unacceptable. Though there is nothing overtly problematic about the excerpt, Edward Said was famous as a Palesti nian activist and remains a highly controversial figure. He is viewed very positively by some groups and very negatively by other groups. Reviewers who are not familiar with the people depicted in test materials should check reference sources to avoid the inadvertent inclusion of controversial figures. 26. That on the 1st day of January, A.D. 1863, all persons held as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then, the nceforward, and forever free. a. Acceptable. Mention of slavery is acceptable, and the Common Core State Standards call for the inclusion of documents important in American history, such as the Emancipation Proclamation. English language arts items The next set of examples consists of items or parts of English language arts items. 1. According to the passage, how long ago did Homo sapiens evolve into a distinct species? a. Unacceptable. To answer the question about when human beings evolved implies that human beings evolved from other species. That implication is not in compliance with the guideline regarding evolution. 2. The character delivering the monologue attributes the arrogance of the French to which of the following? a. Unacceptable. Describing all of the people in a nation as \"arrogant\" is a clear case of offensive stereotyping. The question is not in compliance with the guideline concerning stereotypes. 3. Describe the changes within the ecosystem portrayed in the video, including the impact of man's activities on weather patterns, and possible solutions to correct ecological problems. a. Unacceptable. The question uses \"man\" to refer to all people, which is not in compliance with the guideline on appropriate terminology for men and women. The influence of people on climate change is highly controversial and is out of compliance with the guideline on the avoidance of advocacy. 4. The author compares the artist's use of color to which of the following? a. Acceptable if direct experience of color is not required to understan d the passage and answer the items. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 93b. Unacceptable if direct experience of color is required. The material would be unfair for students who are blind. 5. Our society stereotypes old people as weak, uninformed, forgetful, and foolish. Discuss the extent to which you agree or disagree with this stereotype. a. Unacceptable. The question blatantly reinforces stereotypes of a group and invites test takers to agree with the offensive stereotypes. 6. Isaiah wrote, \"Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes.\" Describ e the meaning of that quotation and give two examples of people who are \"wise in their own eyes\" from your reading or from your personal experience. Explain your choices. a. Unacceptable. The excerpt violates guidelines about the avoidance of religious material, even though the students are not asked to write directly about religion. 7. In the play, Luz was restricted to a wheelchair for which of the following reasons? a. Unacceptable. The phrase \"was restricted to a wheelchair\" should be replaced with more objective terminology such as \"began using a wheelchair.\" 8. According to the newspaper article, Robert died how many years after his brother John? a. Acceptable. According to the Guidelines, it is acceptable to mention death as long as gruesome details are not depicted. 9. It can be inferred from the passage that the spinnaker is most effective during a race when the wind is in which position relative to the boat? a. Unacceptable. Using sailboats for racing is out of compliance with the prohibition against luxuries. Also, unless \"spinnaker\" and its use are explained clearly in the passage, the item would depend on invalid specialized knowledge. 10. Based on information in the documentary, wh ich of the following people is most likely to carry the sickle cell trait but show no symptoms of the sickle cell disease? a. Unacceptable. Diseases that affect particular groups of people are likely to be problematic in terms of fairness. This topic is best avoided. 11. The lecturer stated that among spiders found in many houses in the United States, the bite of which of the following is most likely to cause painful, deep wounds? a. Unacceptable. The focus on \"painful, deep wounds\" from spiders \"found in many hous es\" makes the item out of compliance with the guideline regarding animals that are frightening to children. 12. The video excerpt of Baryshnikov dancing in The Nutcracker best illustrates which of the following aspects of his work described in the magazine article? a. Acceptable if all of the information needed to respond to the item is included in the video excerpt and the magazine article. b. Unacceptable if knowledge of ballet is required to answer the item. Only social dancing of couples is prohibited by the gui delines. STATE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DECEMBER 15, 2016 SDE TAB 5 Page 94 13. Read the excerpt from the diary of a ship captain engaged in transporting slaves and watch the video dealing with the history of slavery in the United States. Imagine that you are a newly captured slave. Describe your experiences on land and on the sea during your journey from Africa to the United States. Use information from both the diary and the video in your description. a. Unacceptable. Mention of slavery as a topic is acceptable, but forcing test takers to imagine that they personally experien ced the transatlantic journey, during which many captives are known to have suffered and died, will be upsetting to some students.

Each week of Phase 1 will have a predominant theme. Anatomy (embryonic, mi croscopic and gross, including cadaver dissection), physiology, genetics, pharmacology, data analysis, metabolism and nutrition will be taught in relation to the weekly themes. Students will engage in professional development through self-exploration and se lf-assessment activities across Phase 1 as they examine the different psycho-social and techni cal dimensions of patient care. Clinical Experience: CMC I The 4-year Clinical Method Curri culum (CMC) partners groups of students and core clinical faculty for the longitudinal development of clin ical skills in a mentored learning community environment. Each student is assigned to a learning community with approximately 10 students and 1-2 core faculty members. Students will work within their learning communities throughout their medical school career to ensure they possess the core foundational clinical method knowledge, skills, attitudes an d behaviors necessary to provid e optimal patient care in a dynamic healthcare environment. Instructional methods include didactic presentation, small group discussion, simulation, authentic clinical experiences, and mentoring. Phase 2: (2.1) Molecules, Cells and Cancer: This 8-week unit, beginning in early January, integrates molecular and cell biology with genetics, hematology, cancer biology and basic oncology. It includes a strong component of translational research as we explore how we kn ow what we know about the molecular basis of INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 7cancer and other genetic diseases. Students begin their longitudinal clinical experience at the start of this unit. The clinical skills taught include breast, pelvic an d male genital exams. Students also begin the Subspecialty Clinical Experience, where they spend one afternoon per month in a specialty clinic related to topics being learned in the classroom. Phase 2: (2.2) Host and Defense: This 9-week unit begins in March and introduces infectious disease, the biology of the immune system, the body's response to pathogens, and an timicrobial therapy. Instruction centers on common clinical presentations, beginning with fever and then moving through major body systems while addressing increasingly complica ted diseases, from sore throat to AIDS. Clinical Experience: CMC II CMC II focuses on expanding hist ory-taking skills, advanced ph ysical examination in specific areas, professional communication skills, in troduction of lab and imaging selection and interpretation, and beginning ski lls in diagnostic reasoning. This will be taught through a combination of lecture sessions, small group activities, independent study and Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELO). ELO activities are a component of CMC 2 and provide students with real patient interactions in which they wi ll apply knowledge learned in all components of the medical school curriculum. These experiences will also introduce them to the clinical environment and help them understand how to integrate into the clinical team. Core Faculty and/or practicing clinician attendings will oversee the ELO activities . Year 2 Phase 2: (2.3) Metabolism and Reproduction: This 9-week unit runs from late July or early August. It begins with th e pathophysiology of the gastrointestinal tract and the digestion/absorpti on of nutrients. The basic metabolism covered in phase 1 is reviewed and built upon as we focus on the liver. Obesity, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance lead into endocrinology. From the sex hormones, we transition to reproduction. Clinical reasoning skills, with a particular focus on causes and treatment of abdominal pain, will be emphasized throughout the unit . Phase 2: (2.4) Circulation, Respiration and Regulation: This 11-week unit runs from October to mid-Dece mber. This unit is desi gned to help students develop the clinical medici ne skills and medical science knowledge to be able to propose rational differential diagnoses and diagnostic and treatment strategies for clinical problems affecting the circulatory, respiratory, and renal organ systems . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 8 Phase 2: (2.5) Brain and Behavior: This 9-week unit begins early January through February of the second calendar year. The unit integrates basic neuroanatomy and neurophysiolog y with the clinical disciplines of neurology, psychiatry, pathology and pharmacology. The unit provides the students with the conceptual framework necessary to recognize common neurological and mental health issues . Phase 2: (2.6) Skin, Muscle, Bone and Joint: Upon completion of this 6-week unit, students will be able to name, recognize and describe common dermatologic and musculoskeletal diseases , including the basic science foundations of each condition. In addition, they will describe diseases, clinical presentation and pathophysiology and define terms used on physi cal, microscopic and radiologic examinations. Students will be able to gather essential information from clinic patients presenting with dermatologic and musculoskeletal complaints and produce accurate, clear and organized documentation of patient encounters in the form of SOAP notes and complete H&P's. This unit provides students with the knowledge and ski lls necessary to reason through case-based vignettes as seen in USMLE in order to prepare them for USMLE Step I licensing exam and Phases III and IV . Clinical Experience: CMC IIIIV CMC III-IV focuses on advanced history-taking sk ills, advanced physical examination skills to help elicit abnormal findings, professional communication skills, further development of lab and imaging selection and interpretati on, and more advanced skills in diagnostic reasoning. These will be taught through a combination of lectur e sessions, small group activities, independent study and Experiential Learning Opportunities (ELO ). ELO activities provide students with real patient interactions in which they will apply knowledge learned in other components of the medical school curriculum. These experiences will also introduce students to the clinical environment and help them understand how to in tegrate into the clinic al team. Core faculty and/or practicing clinician attendings will oversee the ELO activities. Layers of Medicine: The Layers of Medicine course is a longitudinal , 2-year course in the pre-clerkship curriculum. The overarching goals of the Layers of Medicine course are to provide students with the knowledge, skills and attitudes necessary to: Pr ovide compassionate care to a diverse patient population, understand the complexities of a ch anging health care system and how access to health care impacts patient outcomes, practice me dicine informed by ethical principles, analyze the impact of social, economic, gender, and cultur al factors on health ca re outcomes, develop a positive professional attitude, appreciate and manage the influence of personal values and attitudes on relationships with patients, and find and utilize re sources and information required for optimal patient care . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 9 Year 3 In the third year, emphasis is on the integration of basic science knowledge with clinical, ethical, diagnostic, and problem solving skills. Clinical clerkships, during which students learn patient management as members of the health care team , include family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, psychiatry, and surgery. St udents also take a Topics of Medicine course, which reviews a series of simulated patients with common medical problems seen in ambulatory medicine. The student is al so required to complete a four-week clinical neurology clerkship between the end of the sophomore year and the end of the senior year. Each student must also satisfactorily complete an ob jective standardized clinical examination (OSCE) administered at the end of the 3rd year prior to being promoted to the 4th year. Clinical Experience: CMC V CMC V includes a transition to clerkship co urse aimed at preparing students for their clerkships. Additionally students will work with Core Faculty inte rmittently during the year to apply and further develop skills in clinical method with an intense focus on advanced communication skill development and developing tools for challenging cl inical encounters to prepare students for the more autonomous role they will assume during their 4th year . Family Medicine Clinical Clerkship Six weeks with a community based of faculty fami ly medicine preceptor.

(12 months): Students develop advanced skills through sub-internship, critical care, advanced internal medicine and elective courses. They prepare for entry into residency by selecting curriculum specific to th eir career specialty interests. Specialty specific mentors are desi gnated for each specialty and are available to help with course scheduling and career mentoring. All students graduating from the Universi ty of Utah School of Medicine must complete a sub- internship rotation, a critical care cler kship, and 4-weeks of advanced internal INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 11medicine. Students have ample elective time to explore additional clinic al interests, research and seminar based courses. Additionally all students must part icipate in two required courses in the fourth year - the Longitudinal Preparation fo r Internship (LPIC) course and the Transition to Internship Course (TIC). The LPIC runs July through March and meets for one afternoon every other week. The curriculum emphasizes career mentoring, preparation for the Match. The TIC is a 2-week course after the students ha ve matched. The course is intended to be a capstone course for their medical school career . The curriculum emphasizes clinical reasoning skills, psychomotor task training, team communic ation, and the delivery of curriculum thread content needed for the student to be successful in their matched internship. Hands-on task trainers, high fidelity simulation models, inter-pr ofessional education, role playing, small group discussions and formal didactic le ctures are used to deliver conten t. Similar to the LPIC, shared portions of the curriculum are de livered to the entire class an d some portions are delivered to specialty specific groups. Clinical Experience: CMC VI The 4-year Clinical Method Curriculum partners gr oups of students and co re clinical faculty for the longitudinal development of clinical skills in a mentored learning community environment. The fourth year of this curriculum is under development. Threads The medical arts curriculum is focused on the inte gration of 10 threads into the core curriculum. The threads are: interprofessional education, nu trition, women's and gender health, geriatrics, health care systems, public and global health , medical ethics and hu manities, translational research, biomedical informatics, and cultural diversity. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 12Idaho Student Affairs Update Program Leadership Dr. Benjamin Chan is a Board Certified physician in General Psychiatry and Child & Adolescent Psychiatry. He attend ed medical school at the University of Utah School of Medicine until 2004, residency at George Washington University in Washington DC and Fellowship at Universi ty of Maryland in Baltimore, MD. He moved back to Utah in 2010 and join ed the faculty in the Department of Psychiatry. He works as an inpatient hospitalist at the University Neuropsychiatric Institute (UNI) treating children and adolescents with a wide variety of acute psychiatric conditions. He was appointed Assistant Dean of Admissions in March of 2012 and Assistant Dean of Idaho Student Affairs in July 2014. Dr. Bridgette Baker is a Board Certified Family Medicine physician. She earned her M.D. degree from UUSOM and completed her Family Medicine Residency at the Family Medicine Residency of Idaho in Boise. She is currently on staff at Saint Alphonsus and Mercy Medi cal Center. Additionally, she is the Director of Idaho Student Programs fo r the University of Utah, after being recruited in 2015. In this capacity, she coordinates the placement of Idaho students from the University of Utah medi cal school into clinical practices within the state of Idaho. Admissions Our goal is to select the most capable students to attend our school and to have a balanced, but heterogeneous group that will excel in both the art and science of medicine. We recognize that a diverse student body promotes an atmosphere of creativity, experimentation and discussion that is conducive to learning. Exposure to a variety of perspectives and experi ences prepares students to care for patients in all walks of life and in every segment of society. Considered individually, age, color, gender, sexu al orientation, race, na tional origin, religion, status as a person with a disability, status as a veteran or disabled vete ran are not determinants of diversity and are not identified as unique characteristics during the admissions process. MCAT scores and grades are carefully scrutinized and are an important part of the application process. All grades received for college credit are included in the AMCAS GPA calculation. If a course is repeated, both grades received for that course are calculated into the GPA. Pass/Fail grades received for college credit are no t included in the AMCAS GPA calculation. As important as grades and test scores are, by themselves they do not predict who will be successful in medical school. The demands of me dical education and life as a physician are not for everyone. We consider how the applicant balanc es outside activities and responsibilities with schoolwork to be an indicator of ability to de al with the rigors of life as a physician. The committee is interested in the applicant's moti vation for attending medical school and his/her INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 13understanding of the medical profession. Commitment to community service, ethical behavior, compassion, leadership ability and communication skills are important characteristics of physicians. Applications and interviews assist us in evaluating these qualities. We expect applicants to be courteous, respectf ul and professional at all times. Academic Standards and Required Activities We evaluate applications against minimum and average standards in 7 specific areas. Applicants must achieve at least the minimum level of performance in all 7 areas and be average or above in 5 out of the 7 areas in order to proceed in the admissions process. Successful applicants distinguish themselves with outstanding performance in one or more of these areas. The 8 areas are listed below. Grade Point Average (GPA) The minimum acceptable GPA is 3.2. Applicants with a science, non-science or overall GPA below 3.2 will not be considered. All grades received for college credit are included in the AMCAS GPA calculation. If a course is repeated, both grades received for that course are calculated into the GPA. To determine average criteria, the applicant's GP A is compared to the average GPA of students who have gone on to attend medical school from the institution granting the applicant's highest degree. Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) All applicants are required to take the MCAT wi thin 3 years of their application. Example: For applications for the class entering medical school in 2015, scores will be accepted from tests taken in 2014, 20113 and 2012. Tests taken after September will not be considered for the current application year. The minimum acceptable score for each section of the 2014 and January 2015 MCAT is 7. The average overall score is 30. For tests taken in 2014 and January 2015 only, the best score for each section will be considered. If the test is taken after April 1, 2015, only the scores from the latest test will be accepted. The minimum acceptable score is 123 in each of the four sections. Community/Volunteer Service Community/Volunteer service is de fined as involvement in a service activity without constraint or guarantee of reward or compen sation. The medical profession is strongly oriented to service in the community. Applicants should demonstrate a commitment to the community by involving themselves in service and volunteer activities. Work performed in service learning courses and community service performed as part of employment does not satisfy this requirement. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 14 The minimum requirement is 36 hour s completed in the last 4 years. The average applicant devotes 100 hours during the 4 years prior to entering medical school. Leadership Leadership is defined as a position of responsibility for others, with a purpose to guide or direct others. Dedication, determination, ability to make decisions and a willingness to contribute to the welfare of others are indicators of one's ability to succeed in medicine. Individuals with these characteristics readily accept positions of lead ership and are an asset to their community and profession. Leadership capacity can be demons trated in a variety of ways. Positions in employment, church, community and school organizations including coaching, tutoring and mentoring will satisfy this requirement. The minimum leadership requirement is 1 leader ship experience lasting 3 months within the last four years. The average applicant has 3 different leadership experiences each lasting 3 months during the 4 years prior to matriculation. Research Research is defined as involvement in a scholarly or scientific hypothesis investigation that is supervised by an individual with verifiable research credentials. Research may be in any discipline and performed at any site. However, it must involve the testing of a hypothesis. The minimum is part of a class where applicant answered or tested a hypothesis and received a grade. Examples: A writin g project, laboratory work, etc. NOTE: Research completed as part of a premedical course requirement will not be accepted. The average is hypothesis-based research th at is supervised by an individual with verifiable research credentials. May includ e independent research or senior thesis. Physician Shadowing Physician shadowing is defined as the observation of a physician as s/he cares for and treats patients and carries out the other re sponsibilities of medical practice. Shadowing must be done with an allopathic (MD) or osteopathic (DO) physician in their practice in the United States. Time spent sh adowing medical students, interns, residents, fellows, physician assistants, podi atrists, veterinarians, nurses , EMTs, PhDs etc., will not be considered. It is our recommendation that appl icants shadow several physicians who work in various specialties including primary care. Shadowing family me mbers who are physicians is discouraged. The minimum requirement is eight hours shadowing a physician(s). The average applicant spends 24 hours with a physician(s). Patient Exposure INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 15Patient exposure is defined as direct interactio n with patients and hands-on involvement in the care of conscious people in a health care related environmen t, attending to their health maintenance/progression or end of life needs. It is important that the applicant be comfortable working with and around people who are ill, sick, injured or diseased. Direct patient exposure can be gained in a va riety of ways e.g. volunteering or working in hospitals, emergency rooms, clinics or nursing ca re facilities, hospice ,or physical rehabilitation centers. Patient contact does not include indirect patient care such as housekeeping (cleaning, operating, or patient rooms) staffing the hosp ital information desk, or working in a pharmacy The minimum patient exposure requirement is 32 hours. The average experience is 48 hours. Note: Physician shadowing and caring for friends an d family members cannot be used to meet this requirement.

Students can shadow a rural doctor for up to 8 weeks. Students receive a stipend and travel expenses. Students who have completed this optional expe rience in the past have noted the following benefits and recommendations: I went into this experience hoping to gain some insight into the everyday life of an orthopedic surgeon and to learn how to be a better student during my clinical rotations. I was very pleased with my time that I spent working with [my preceptor]. I think that he taught me va luable things about being a good student and also gave me an accurate representation of an orthopedist's life style. I also brushed up on some of my knowledge and clinical skills along the way. --B. Denney, 2012 Most students in medical school have had brief shadowing experiences that consist of several days here and there. It was a great opportunity to see the daily rhythm of a private practice primary ca re facility because the time will come when I will have to consider the type of environment in which I would like to practice. This was a valuable opportunity to gain skills in clinical medicine, gain knowledge about longitudinal care and to gain experience in both a specific field and practice type that may be a career interest. --G. Josten, 2014 UUSOM will continue to support students who wish to participate in this opportunity by educating them on this option, assisting them in finding a rewarding placement in a specialty they are interested in an d providing access to a stipend to offset costs. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 19Idaho Rural Outreach Program (IROP) Idaho has a notable demand for health care prov iders in its rural commun ities. The Idaho Rural Outreach Program (IROP) revolves around the co ncept of medical studen ts inspiring the youth of rural Idaho to pursue a career in the medical field with the long-term goal being to alleviate the shortage of health care prov iders in Idaho. The goal is to have a significant impact on the youth in rural areas of Idaho that will motivate them towards a productive career in medicine. As 1st and 2nd year medical students we have a unique perspective with regards to the admissions process and what medical school is really like. Our experiences the last several years have been overwhelmingly positive. The educators we have worked with have expressed their gratitude and noted how beneficial the program has been to th e students. They appreciate the opportunity it gave the students to gain exposure to a career in medicine and expressed how difficult it is to find such opportunities. Since its creation in 2007, medical students taking part in IROP have traveled to high schools in various rural areas of Idaho including: Malad, Marsh Valley, Soda Springs, Bear Lake, Burley, Preston, the Boise area, Twin Falls, McCall and the surrounding area, Idaho Falls and Rexburg. They present a PowerPoint that discusses the different career op tions in the health profession: medical assistant, pharmacist, dentist, doctor, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, etc. They then split the classes up into small groups and taught students about the heart, using plastic mo dels and elk/deer hearts as teaching aides. They also had kidneys, a liver and spleen which they incorporated into the teaching. The following is one student's account of his experience: It was a rewarding experience to return to my high school and engage the students on their level. They all seemed very engaged and interested in the dissection. Additionally, they were very inquisitive about the different paths to becoming a medical professional. I don't know that many had previously had the opportunity to consider what it takes to be a physician. Since my own path to medical school started with the mentorship of a high school science teacher, I feel these types of programs are invaluab le in engaging students early on. --C. Weinch, 2016 Clinical Medical Education in Idaho During an Idaho medical student's third year, the Family Medicine Clinical Clerkship is completed in Idaho. The Family Medicine Clinical Clerkship is six weeks with a community based family medicine preceptor. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 20 Family Practice Clinical Clerkship Brief Description of Clerkship During the clerkship, all students develop competencies in patient care, systems-based practice, lifelong-learning, and professionalism. Stud ents assess and manage acute, chronic, and preventive medical issues in the outpatient family medicine setting. Students also engage in reflective and interactive activities throughout the month, designed to develop awareness and hone skills for physician-patie nt relationships. These rela tionships are an essential and powerful tool for good care of patients. The majority of time is spent in direct patient care, most of which occurs in the outpatient family medicine clinic. The patient care is under the direction of a board-certified family physician member of the clerkship faculty team. Settings are diverse and include inner city, rural, urban, and suburban. This range of choices, as well as the opportunity to conduct patient care in the community, where the majority of Americans seek care, makes the Family Medicine Clerkship unique. In addition to cl inical work there is time dedicated to reading, completing projects and assignments, and attending educational sessions. Clerkship Goals As a result of completing the Family Medicine Clerkship: 1. Students will be able to integrate their clin ical reasoning skills with their scientific background through broad-spectrum hands-on patient care in the primary care setting. 2. Students will be able to see patients collaboratively with their preceptor, managing the full spectrum of acute, chronic, and preventive care needs that are addressed in the primary care setting. 3. Students will be able to develop therapeuti c relationships with patients, families and communities. 4. Students will be able to understand how the pr inciples of Family Medicine can help create a more efficient and effective health care system. 5. Students will be able to be more prepared to serve their community, by taking an active learning role in patient care, navigation of complex health systems, lifelong learning, and professional commitment. Timeline The clerkship is six weeks in duration. Students will be expected to be active in clinical duties for the majority of the days, however there is buil t in dedicated study time for the shelf and the various assignments. Students will be working in the preceptor model, which means the student will work similar hours to the physician each day. Preceptors/Site Requirements INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 1 Page 21The preceptor must be board certified in fami ly medicine, and hold a University of Utah Volunteer Clinical Faculty appointment with the Department of Family and Preventative Medicine. Formative Clinical Performance Assessment All Phase III Clerkships employ a common formative feedback form that includes both a Student Self-Assessment and Faculty Evaluation of Student section ( Formative Clerkship Feedback Form ). This self-assessment and feed back is intended to be format ive in nature and will not be used in the calculation of Preceptor Evalua tion data for final grade determination. Preceptor Evaluations All Phase III Clerkships employ a common preceptor evaluation form that instructs evaluators to select performance based behaviors along mu ltiple dimensions that best represent the student's highest sustained performance during the preceptor's period of observation.

October 2013 Board Approved first reading the Board Policy III.L. December 2013 The Board approv ed second reading of proposed amendments to Board Policy III.L. October 2016 The Board approved the first reading of proposed amendments to Board Policy III.L. APPLICABLE STATUTES, RULE OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governin g Policies & Procedures, Section III.L, Continuing Education and Cr edit for Prior Learning BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The Board approved an initial fi rst reading of this policy at their October 20, 2016 meeting; however, the wrong version of t he draft policy was included with the agenda materials. Due to the differences between both versions, the proposed amendments to Board Policy III.L are bei ng presented to the Board for another first reading. The Idaho State Board of Education (B oard) has been committed to providing Idahoans the opportunity to earn post- secondary credit(s) through the demonstration of knowledge. This process is generally called the assessment of prior learning, or prior l earning assessment (PLA). PL As provide a bridge for student learning acquired outside the traditi onal college setting. Prior learning should be evaluated upon the student 's request and be eligible for credit if it is demonstrated by successfully passing an appropriately rigorous assessment. Research shows that student s who earn credit through PLAs are more likely to persist, take more courses over a lo nger period of time, and graduate with credentials and degrees. For these reasons, PLAs are essential to achieving the State Board's goal that 60% of 25-34 year olds hold a certificate or degree by 2020. At the June 2013 Board meeting the Workforce Development Council's Educational Attainment Task Force m ade three recommendations to the Board for reaching the Board's educationa l attainment goal. One of these INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 2 recommendations was that t he Board establish a stat ewide portfolio approval process for awarding credits based on prior learning and experience. The recommendation was forwarded to Boar d staff for furt her development. In early 2014, the Board contracted with the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) to work with its instituti ons to strengthen the awareness of PLA on the campuses, determine the scope and natur e of PLA services best suited to each institution, and ident ify opportunities for par tnerships between and among institutions. As a national leader in the promoti on of adult and experiential learning, CAEL was and remains well pos itioned to assist our institutions. In its final report, CAEL acknowledged that over the course of the project: \"several institutions made specific changes that expanded PLA options for students: the provision of reliabl e challenge exams for high volume departments; intentional partnerships between academic affairs and student services to smooth the PLA path for students; the revision of portfolio development courses tailored to academic departments; proactive communications and marketing tools to inform students about PLA; a focus on implementing PLA for specific populations such as veterans and programs such as health care; and improving the quality and consistent use of course learning outcomes to guide assessment.\" The final report also indicated disparat eness in PLA efforts across the state noting that among institutions there is: \"a considerable range of approaches to PLA, including different credit limits and multiple ways that students could use PLA to accelerate their path to degree completion.... [Institutions] revealed different interpretations of accreditation guidelines as well as incomplete information about the nature of PLA me thods; they expressed interest in pursuing additional information about lesser known methods...to determine the potential for these methods on their campuses.... [I]institutions discussed the challenges of transferability of PLA and the advantages of moving toward clearer articulation agreements and curriculum crosswalks.\" The proposed changes to Board policy ai m to provide a solid floor for Board expectations regarding the use of PLAs and granting of credit for prior learning in Idaho. IMPACT The proposed amendments to Board Po licy III.L will establish modernized expectations for how and when PLAs ar e to be administered and when credit may be awarded. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Board Policy III.L - First Reading Page 5 Attachment 2 - CAEL's Final Report Page 11 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 3 The use of PLAs and granting of credit is ancillary to achieving the Board's 60% Goal. Current PLA efforts on the campus es are insufficiently employed by students or aspiring students. As a result, these opportunities are not effectively communicated which leads to underut ilization. The proposed changes aim to create a set of shared expectations for the usage of PLA and granting of credit. Board staff recommends approval.

INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 11 To: Interested Parties (and to CAAP on Feb. 16, 2016) From: Christopher Mathias Date: January 25, 2016 Re: PLA in Idaho and recommendati ons for making improvements 1 I NTRODUCTION The Idaho State Board of Educ ation (SBOE) is committed to providing Idahoans the opportunity to earn post-secondar y credit(s) through the demonstr ation of knowledge. This process is generally called the assessment of prior learning, or prior learning assessment (PLA). PLAs provide a bridge for student lear ning acquired outside the traditional college setting. Research shows that students who earn credit through PLA are more likely to persist, take more courses over a longer period of time, and gradua te with credentials and degrees. For these reasons, PLAs are essential to achieving the State Board's goal that 60% of 25-34 year olds hold some sort of post-secondary credential by 2020. As this work moves through its various stages - from proposed recommendations in this white paper to decision making to program design and implementation - cost will increasingly come to bear. So a question that needs repeated asking is: how committed are we all to providing a comprehensive, accessible, and navigable PLA infrastructure? Equitable commitment from all parties is crucial. This paper aims to do the following: Overview the recent work conduct ed jointly with the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning. Provide a comprehensive overview of stru ctural and policy challenges facing PLA in Idaho that must be address ed prior to major statewid e investment in PLA. Provide an informed and consensus-driv en foundation for making updates to Board policy. 2 W ORKING WITH THE COUNCIL FOR ADULT AND EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING (2014-2015) In early 2014, the SBOE contra cted with the Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) to work with its institutions to st rengthen the awareness of PLA on the campuses, determine the scope and nature of PLA services bes t suited to each institution, and identify opportunities for partnerships between and among institutions. As a national leader in the promotion of adult and experiential learning, CAEL was and remains well positioned to assist our institutions. Their final report is available upon request to the SBOE Office. In its final report, CAEL acknowledged that over the course of the project: \"several institutions m ade specific changes that expanded PLA options for students: the provision of reliable challenge exams for high volume departments; intentional partnerships between academic affairs and student services to smooth the PLA path for students; the revision of portfolio development courses tailored to academic departments; proactive communications and marketing tools to inform students about PLA; a focus on INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 12 implementing PLA for specific populati ons such as veterans and programs such as health care; and improving the quality and consistent use of course learning outcomes to guide assessment.\" The final report also noted disparateness in PLA efforts across the state noting that among institutions there is: \"a considerable range of approaches to PLA, including diffe rent credit limits and multiple ways that students could use PLA to accelerate their path to degree completion.... [Institutions] rev ealed different interpretations of accreditation guidelines as well as in complete information about the nature of PLA methods; they expressed interest in pursuing additional information about lesser known methods...to determine the po tential for these methods on their campuses.... [I]institutions discussed the challenges of transfe rability of PLA and the advantages of moving toward clearer articulation agreements and curriculum crosswalks.\" CAEL also observed that during the course of the project, about half t he institutions were engaged in \"active inquiry with CAEL to pursue goals that were both realistic and linked to measurable change.\" While \"the re maining institutions were passive participants in the project\" some \"institutions [a ]re ready to steadily move fo rward\" while others are \"still deliberating the role of PLA on their campuses.\" While the final report provides an objective view of PLA in Idaho, it also provides some important information upon which to build a pathway forward. The report notes the agreement across institutions and the need to work towards the following: 1. Create a common language and def initions for PLAs to strengthen transferability of PLA credit and sustain quality assurance efforts across institutions. 2. Develop a statewide portfolio network. 3. Make transparent those standardized test s commonly used and their respective cut scores. 4. Create a transparent fee structure fo r PLA services that enables reasonable consistency while responding to differences among institutional PLA programs. Similarly, meeting notes taken by Board Staff revealed: 5. The need to ensure our PLA infrastructu re is simple to access, understand, navigate and administer. 6. The importance of clear and consistent marketing and messaging. 7. The importance of transferability and collaboration across campuses. 8. The value of tying PLA to multiple se ts of circumstances and completion pathways. 3 C URRENT POLICIES REGARDING PLA An understanding of PLA in Idaho is contingent on awareness of the multiple policies and laws that govern its admin istration. Such an understand ing is hereby provided. Board Policy III.L.1.b defines credit for prior learning as a \"demonstration of learning outcomes for knowledge acquired from wo rk and life experiences , independent reading INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 13 and study, various tests like Advanced Placement (AP) and the College Level Examination (CLEP), and/or approved military education or experiences.\" The purpose of the policy is, in part, to establish \"the foundation by which institutions...provide students with opportunities to demonstr ate competencies acquired through life experience by developing opt ions for credit for prior learning.\" Section 2.b (Credit for Prior Lear ning) reads in its entirety: All credit for prior learning must be guided by approved inst itutional policies and procedures. These policies and proc edures must include the awarding of credit for education, training or servic e completed by an individual as a member of the armed forces or reserv es as outlined in Section 33-3727 Idaho Code. Institutions shall make no assu rances regarding the number of credits to be awarded prior to the completion of the institution's review process. Institutional policies and procedures shall maintain the following minimum standards: i. Credits shall be awarded only at the undergraduate level to enrolled students. ii. Credits shall be awarded only for docum ented student achievement that is equivalent to expected learning outcomes for courses within the institution's regular curricular offerings. iii. Credits shall be awarded based on t he recommendation of appropriately qualified faculty. iv. Credits shall be limited to a maximum of 25% of the credits required for a degree. v. Credits shall be identified on students' tr anscripts as prior learning credits and may not duplicate other credit awarded to the student in fulfillment of degree requirements. This language strictly adheres to the Nort hwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU) standard 2.C.7 which reads: \"Credit for prior experient ial learning, if granted, is: a) guided by approved policies and procedures; b) awarded onl y at the undergraduate level to enrolled students; c) limit ed to a maximum of 25% of the credits needed for a degree; d) awarded only for documented student achievement equivalent to expected learning achievement for cour ses within the institution's regular curricular offerings; and e) grant ed only upon the recommendation of appropriately qualified teaching faculty. Credit granted for prior experiential learning is so identifie d on students' transcripts and may not duplicate other credit awarded to the student in fulf illment of degree requirements. The institution makes no assurances regar ding the number of credits to be awarded prior to the completion of t he institution's review process.\" Additionally, Idaho Code Section 33-3727 reads, in pertinent part: The State Board of Education...shall deve lop policies relating to the award of academic credit for education, training or service completed by an individual INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 14 as a member of the armed forces or re serves of the United States, the national guard of any state, t he military reserves of any stat e or the naval militia of any state, where such education, training or service is determined to satisfy such established policies. In sum, state and Board policy makes clear t hat PLA is an important tool for promoting educational attainment. However, aside from a clear requirement to craft PLA policies related to military training, the policies do not clearly require Idaho's public post-secondary institutions to offer or implement PLA gener ally and, perhaps more importantly, do not provide a foundation for administering PLA t hat is subject to a cycle of continuous improvement. 4 C ONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS The concepts and definitions that underlie the administration of PLA are not fully encompassed in relevant policies. As the under standing of effective PLA has matured, so to have the concepts that guide its administration. Indeed, \"credit for prior learning\" is the end while PLA is the means, and Board Policy is largely silent on the means (this must change). This section aims to provide baseline definitions moving forward. As discussed above, the State Board defines credit for prior learning (CPL ) as a \"demonstration of learning outcomes for knowledge acquired from work and life experiences, independent reading and study....\" It is slightly confusing to equate credits (the end) with a demonstration (the means) when in fact it is the demonstration that results in credits. Thus, moving forwar d, a simpler and more accura te definition of CPL might simply be: credits earned via PLAs. PLAs - a set of well-established, resear ched, and validated methods for assessing learning for college credit - allow students to demonstrate knowledge, competencies, skills and habits of mind in a particular field and have that learning evaluat ed for college credit by appropriate faculty. Some states - neighboring Montana, for example - officially recognize two broad categories of prior learni ng evaluated through PLA. Instructional-based prior learning (IBPL) is learning that took place in a classroom but not within a two or f our year institution. IBPL is commonly assessed, for example, using Advanced Placement (AP) tests and American Council on Education (A CE) credit recommendation. Experiential-based prior learning (EBPL) occurred outside of a traditional classroom. EBPL is commonly assessed, for example, using CLEP tests, challenge exams, or portfolio assessment reviews. Idaho should consider adopting this bi-furcated approach. The following might serve as an exh austive list of PLAs in Idaho: 1. Standardized tests, including: a. CLEP b. DSST c. UExcel d. AP e. IB INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 15 f. SAT/ACT 2. Credit recommenders, including: a. American Council on Education (ACE) b. National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS) 3. Faculty developed a ssessments, including: a. Technical Competency Credit b. Course specific challenge exams c. Locally-Evaluated Industry and Workplace Education/Training Programs d. Portfolio (Each institution's portfo lio PLA shall exist within an statewide portfolio network) This paper makes repeated use of the term statewide portfolio network (SPN). An SPN specific to Idaho must possess the following characteristics: a. CPL earned via the SPN are applicable only to particular academic and technical programs. b. Once CPL derives from the SPN, those cr edits shall be automatically transferable to Idaho's other public post-secondary inst itutions under circumstances to be prescribed later. c. Faculty who conduct PLAs in a SPN must maintain proper training. 5 O UTSIDE PERSPECTIVES The Legislature, State Board of Education, and I daho's public post-secondary institutions are not the only entitie s with an interest in the adminis tration of PLAs in Idaho. An increasing number of ent ities have taken a heightened interest in PLA; what follows are two examples. During the 2014 Legislative session, both hous es adopted House Concurrent Resolution 53 which directed members of the State Board, and the Departments of Commerce and Labor to convene a working group to develop a robust plan including proposed measures and benchmarks to strengthen the ties between our public educations systems and Idaho's business and industry. The working group made eight recommendations first of which was to \"create a statewide portfolio approval pr ocess for awarding credits based on prior learning and experience.\" The establishment of such a statewide process is discussed in section 6. To achieve the State Board's 60% Goal, the JK and Kathryn Albertson Foundation (the Foundation) has also discussed the need to det ermine the \"health\" of higher education institutions in Idaho in their ability to re cruit, retain and graduate adult learners. The Foundation has discussed this interest with CAEL and learned there are options for gauging \"health.\" For example, the Adult Learner Focused In ventory (ALFI) assessments provide a snapshot of how institutional team members and adult students view the institutions through the lens of the nine principles of Effectively Serving Adult Learners. As this work moves forward, it may be pr udent for our institutions to conduct ALFI assessments prior to any major invest ments in their PLA infrastructure. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 16 6 R ECOMMENDATIONS Idaho aims to establish a PLA infrastructure t hat is sustainable, navigable, and accessible with clear points of entry. For this to occur we must acknowledge that current policy has not provided a strong foundation for a sustainable and modern PLA infrastructure and additional policy guidance is necessary. At minimum, Board Policy III.L must be revised. The following in conjunction with current polic ies (and appropriate changes thereto) would help provide a modernized foundat ion for creating a stronger PLA infrastructure in Idaho. The statewide PLA advisory group recomme nds the adoption of the following basic principles into all relevant policy: 1. Prior learning should be evaluated upon a student's request and be eligible for credit through a PLA if it is demonstrated by successfully passing an appropriately rigorous assessment. 2. The definitions outlined and recommended in section 4, above, shall apply statewide. 3. Institutions are responsible for determi ning how best to implement PLAs within the context of its mission, culture, student needs and academic programs. 4. While the Institutions shall maintain the efficacy of this policy, as well as assuring students have access to the most appr opriate and modern prior learning assessment methods, the State Board of Education shall ov ersee this policy and its administration. 5. Each institution shall (a) assign oversight of PLAs to its highest ranking Academic Officer or his/her designee and (b) designate at least one liaison (person or place) to serve as a PLA resource for faculty, administrators, staff and students. 6. Institutions reserve the right to awar d credit for prior learning beyond the 25% cap when they deem it academically appropriate fo r exceptional students, particularly in PTE programs; CPL earned through the asse ssment of IBPL is excluded from the 25% cap. 7. Idaho's PLA infrastructure shall ensure maximum transferability of CPL among the institutions as today's students are extrem ely mobile. To this end, once recorded on a transcript from an Idaho public post-secondary institution, CPL shall be viewed as if the credit had been earned through a regular in-class assessment at the awarding institution; CPL must be clearly noted if it applies to the 25% cap but need not be if it does not apply. 8. Institutions shall ensure information tec hnology systems can consistently record and track PLA data, as well as enable accurate reporting. 9. When appropriate and with approval from the faculty on campus, PLAs shall be made available for approved pr ograms in a consistent, transferable and comparable manner. 10. Institutions shall prov ide professional development for those faculty members, administrators, and staff working with PLA students to assure high quality, transparency, and consistency in evaluating and awarding CPL. 11. Fees charged to students fo r the administrati on of PLAs must be based on and reflect the operational costs of administe ring a PLA. Fees may not be based on the number of credits awarded. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 2 Page 17 12. Institutions shall integrate the review of institutional PLA pr actices into existing curricular review cycles and NWCCU Accredi tation reviews to maintain their currency and relevance. 7 N EXT STEPS This paper contains a series of re commendations and observations about what should be done in Idaho regarding PLA. What it does not do is delineate in any detail how that work should be done. Thus, it is recommended that the Council on Academic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) take the lead on conceptualizing and implementing all necessary aspects of these recommendations, including but not limited to: 1. The development of a statewide portfolio network . 2. The identification of those cut scores fo r commonly used standardized tests in which there is uniformity across campuses, and making the results transparent. 3. Making more transparent a fee structure fo r PLA services that enables reasonable consistency while responding to differences among institutional PLA programs. Board staff will work with CAAP on propos ing appropriate changes to Board Policy III.L. Those changes will provide a st rong foundation for all other PLA work. Once this policy is updated, the institutions will hav e a stronger basis for making the necessary changes to their policies and practices.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governing Policies and Procedures, Section III.W., Higher Education Research Council Policy BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION The Board's Higher Education Research Policy, III.W. was established to recognize Idaho's universities role as a driving force in innovation, positive economic impact, and enhanced quality of life for Idaho. By developing and leveraging the State's unique research expertise and strengths, Idaho's universities will serve as catalyst and engine to spur the creation of new knowledge, technologies, products and industries. This in turn will lead to new advances and opportunities for economic growth and enhance the Idaho's reputation as a national and international leader in excellence and innovation. The Higher Education Research Council (HERC) of the Idaho State Board of Education is responsible for advising the Board on the implementation of strategies that increase the quality and quantity of research in Idaho, encourage continued public and private support of research, enhance the quality and quantity of academic research produced, increase faculty eligible to compete for research funds, where appropriate, development of Idaho public institutions' research infrastructure and the development and implementation of a higher education statewide strategic plan for research. In addition to establishing the purpose and responsibilities of HERC, Board Policy III.W. outlines minimum reporting and program requirements for those research INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 4 Page 2 programs administered by HERC on behalf of the Board. In March of 2012 new funding was appropriated to the Board's system-wide needs budget for the purposes of further research as well as ongoing funding to Boise State University, Idaho State University and the University of Idaho for activities associated with the Center for Advanced Energy Studies. The funds were appropriated under the umbrella of the Governor's initiative referred to as the Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission (IGEM). The IGEM vision is to leverage private-industry guidance and the talent and expertise of Idaho's research universities to commercialize innovative and viable technologies that will strengthen Idaho's economy. The ongoing appropriation totals $1M to the Department of Commerce for innovation grants and to manage the Commerce IGEM Council; $2M to the institutions for the Center for Advanced Energy Studies; and $2M for competitive state university research under the direction of HERC. To facilitate the work of HERC the Board approved guidelines for the use of the funds by HERC. HERC conducted a competitive process and awarded three year projects with the initial funds. Proposed Amendments, incorporate these program requirements into Board Policy III.W. Proposed amendments will also incorporate Board action from the October 10, 2014 Special Board meeting requiring Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho to report annual ly to the Board on institution related CAES activities through HERC. Additional amendments will make technical corrections and update minimum reporting requirements to better align with the current array of research programs administered by HERC. IMPACT Approval of the amendments to Board policy III.W. will provide for more applicable minimum reporting requirements for all programs funded through HERC and incorporate past Board action that was intended to be ongoing into Board policy consistent with the Board Bylaws. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Board Policy III.W., Higher Education Research - 1st Reading Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The proposed changes incorporate past action taken by the Board regarding reporting Center for Advanced Energy Studies activities, use of funds appropriated for the use of the Board's Higher Education Research Council and designated for Idaho Global Entrepreneurial Mission purposes, and update minimum program reporting requirements.

POSTSECONDARY AFFAIRS SUBSECTION: W. Higher Education Research October 2011November 2016 1. Higher Education Research Council a. Purpose and Coverage Idaho's universities seek to be a driving force in innovation, economic development and enhanced quality of life in the State of Idaho through nationally and internationally lauded research programs in strategic areas. By developing and leveraging the State's unique research expertise and strengths, Idaho's universities will serve as catalyst and engine to spur the creation of new knowledge, technologies, products and industries. This in turn will lead to new advances and opportunities for economic growth and enhance the State's reputation as a national and international leader in excellence and innovation. The Higher Education Research Council of the Idaho State Board of Education (HERC) provides guidance to Boise State University, Idaho State University, Lewis -Clark State College and the University of Idaho for a statewide collaborative effort to accomplish these goals and objectives. In addition, HERC provides direction for and oversees the use of the limited resources of the State of Idaho provided by the Legislature for research by promoting research activities that will have the greatest beneficial effect on the quality of education and the economy of the State. The implementation of the higher education research policy of the Board will be the duty and responsibility of HERC. HERC shall report annually to the Board on a schedule and in a format established by the Executive Director. b. The Role of Research in Higher Education Research is the creative search for and application of new knowledge. i. Philosophical Statements and Guiding Principles The significant role science, technology and other research play in statewide economic development is also accompanied by a demand for the scrutiny of publicly funded research, accountability, and attention to the management of ethical, legal, and safety issues associated with academic research. To fulfill this role, HERC will direct and oversee the development, implementation, and monitoring of a statewide strategic plan for research. The development of a statewide strategic plan for research will assist in the identification of general research areas that will enhance the economy of Idaho via partnering between academia, industry, and/or government. HERC will facilitate this partnering and interaction among business, industry and the public sector with science, engineering and other research faculty. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 4 Page 6 This Policy is designed to assist the public baccalaureate and post- baccalaureate institutions in addressing these areas via appropriate research activities through: 1) individual and multi-disciplinary research projects; 2) extensive and rapid dissemination of the new knowledge and establishment of knowledge networks which would facilitate public, private, and academic institution interaction; and 3) collaborative relationships between academia and varied shareholders outside the academy. The guiding principles are: 1) to maximize impact on the quality of education and economic development as a consequence of Idaho's investment in quality science, engineering, and other research. 2) to ensure accountability for the state's investment via demonstrable results. ii. Support of research activities with public funds is important because: 1) Research is important in the education of students at all levels. 2) Research plays an important role in maintaining and enhancing faculty quality. 3) Academic research contributes to economic development. iii. The Board desires to increase the quality and quantity of research and to encourage continued public and private support of research in Idaho through application of the following principles: The quality and quantity of academic research produced is extremely dependent upon the research infrastructure. Faculty at Idaho's baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate institutions will be eligible to compete for research funds. iv. The development and implementation of a statewide strategic plan for research is a vehicle for identification of research objectives and areas. c. Specific Funding Programs to Strengthen Research in Idaho The Board recognizes that talent exists on all of the campuses and the importance of permitting competition for research support and initiation funds. Therefore, the Board will use the following criteria in allocating funds for research activities under this policy at the various institutions. Additionally, any condition set forth in the legislative appropriation for these research programs must be demonstrably met by the programs and/or projects that are to receive the appropriation. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 4 Page 7 i. Infrastructure Funding A portion of the competitive research funding should be distributed to the state's baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate institutions to support their science, engineering, and other research infrastructure. Distribution of these funds will be made according to guidelines approved by HERC. These funds should be reserved for library support essential to research, graduate research assistantships, post doctoral fellows, technician support, maintenance contracts, research equipment, competitively awarded summer research support, startup funds for new hires, and incentives to reward faculty for their research achievements. ii. Targeted Research Funding Faculty members at the state's baccalaureate and post-baccalaureate institutions will have an opportunity to submit research project proposals for review under this program. 1) All projects selected for funding under this program will demonstrate the potential for economic benefit or cost savings for the State. 2) A major focus under this program should be start-up and seed funds that will assist a principal investigator in promoting basic or applied research; competing for external funding; and enhancing technology transfer or commercialization. 3) Collaborative research projects are encouraged. Guidelines for this program will be established by HERC, will incorporate an independent peer review, and will include an evaluation component for commercial applicability for the benefit of the State. iii. Research Centers Funding Many important research advances are made through focused research centers. These centers should involve several faculty members from multiple institutions in conjunction with the necessary research equipment and support personnel. The funds needed to establish centers of this type should be adequate to create a critical research mass for multiple years leading to research center sustainability. State funding should be supplemented by non- state matching funds. iv. State Matching Awards Under this program State funds would be available to match those awarded by non-state sources by using an external peer review process. Examples of matching entities for the state matching funds would be: 1) Federal Agencies INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 4 Page 8 2) EPSCoR projects e.g., National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Department of Energy, Department of Defense, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, etc. 3) Foundations 4) Business and Industry 5) Other v.

However, in the event that an institution plans to contract with a priv ate corporate entity (other than private entities in the business of providing educational progr ams and course) outside of their Service Region, the contracting institution s hall notify the Designated Institutions in the Service Region an d institutions with Statewide Program Responsibilities, as appropriate . If the corporate entity is located in a municipality that encompasses the campus of a Designated Institution, the Board encourages the contracting institution to include and draw upon the resources of the Designated Institution insomuch as is possible. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 1 BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY SUBJECT New Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies and Community Development REFERENCE August 2016 Based on approved line item request titled \"Public Service Initiative\" for $2 million. APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedures, Section III.G. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University (BSU) proposes to create a new Bachel or of Arts (BA) degree in Urban Studies and Community Development. The new program is the first of two programs being proposed by BSU's new School of Public Service; the second will be a BA in Global Studies, wh ich will be considered at a later Board meeting. Both programs are designed to cross the lines that exist between traditional disciplines such as Political Science, History, Public Policy, and Economics, and will make use of faculty expertise and coursework across the university. Most existing urban studies programs focu s on large, global, industrial cities, such as New York and San Francisco. The proposed program will be different in that it focuses on the challenges faced by communities in the Intermountain West. Cities and towns in the Intermountain West have unique cultural, economic, environmental and political dynamics, typically have a strong interdependence with adjacent ru ral areas, and are often geogr aphically isolated. Idaho is often labeled a rural state becaus e of its vast open space, agricultural and forestry industries, and overall low popul ation density. However, it is largely urban when considering demographics and economic activity: about 1.45 million or 87% of Idaho's estimat ed 1.67 million residents live in designated urban areas, which are defined as communities with a co re population of at least 10,000. Graduates will develop expertise in a range of fields that include economics, public policy, program evaluation, community building, and public communication; that expe rtise will enable them to address urban issues and challenges having to do with community development. Graduates will be well prepared for a vari ety of graduate program s at the state's three universities. They will also have avai lable to them a diverse array of career paths, include community development c oordinators, economic development analysts, nonprofit program coordinators, urban dem ographers, city managers, and real estate proj ect coordinators. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 2 Currently there are no other similar program s offered by Idaho public institutions. Programs in other states include Bachelor's degree s in Urban Ecology at University of Utah; Geography-Urban Studies and Urban and Metropolitan Studies at Arizona State University; Urban and Regional Development at the University of Arizona; Ur ban Studies at the Universi ty of Washington-Tacoma; Community Development at Portland St ate University, and Urban Studies and Planning at the University of Denver. IMPACT BSU projects that the pr ogram will accept approximat ely 20 new students a year, have an overall enrollment of approxim ately 120 students, and have at least 16 graduates per year once the program is fully up and running. The program will be resourced in three ways: Much of the coursework will be pr ovided using already-existing faculty members and coursework. Additional capacity will be provided by two faculty lines devoted to the program, which result from reallocati on of resources from the discontinued Community and Regional Pl anning program and real location of a faculty line from the Department of History. The above resources wil l enable BSU to get the program up and running. Expansion will be facilitated if BSU is successful in receiving the FY18 Line Item Request to the legislature, which includes two faculty lines that would be devoted to this program. ATTACHMENTS Attachment1 - BA in Urban Studies & Community Development proposal Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS The proposed program falls within the mi ssion of BSU, and will create graduates who are prepared to work in a variety of fields suppor ting local communities and will be excellent preparation for graduate studies at all th ree Idaho universities. BSU submitted a new FY18 lin e item request as part of their Public Service Initiative, which includes two faculty lines for the proposed program. This funding would enable the institution to expand the program. If not funded, BSU will still be able to move forward with implementati on; however, the pr ogram would have more modest enrollment growth and increa sed constraints variety of electives available to students. BSU's request to create a new BA in Urban Studies and Community Development is consistent with their Se rvice Region Program Responsibilities and their Five-year Plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in Region III. Consistent with Board Po licy III.Z, no institution has the statewide program responsibility for planning or community development programs. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 3 The proposal includes letters of support from leaders of eleven Idaho cities: Boise, Meridian, Caldwell, Lewiston, E agle, Bonners Ferry, Blackfoot, Middleton, Orofino, Coeur d'Alene, and Ammon. The proposal went through the program review process and was recommended by to the Council on Academic Affair s and Programs (CAAP) on November 17, 2016 and to the Committee on Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) on December 1, 2016. Staff believes that there is sufficient ju stification, based on regional need, for BSU to create the proposed progra m. Staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Boise Stat e University to create a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies and Community De velopment in substantial conformance to the program proposal subm itted as Attachment 1. Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 4 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 5 Page 2 Rationale for Creation or Modification of the Program 1. Describe the request and give an overview of the changes that will result. Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Identify any existing program that this program will replace. Boise State University proposes the creation of a new Bach elor of Arts in Urban Studies and Communi ty Development (USCD). The proposed undergraduate program will be housed in the School of Public Service (SPS). As an interdisciplinary program, it will draw on expertise of and collaborat ion with the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Health Sciences, Business and Economics, and Engine ering. Th e proposed program does not replace any existing program. Grad uates of the proposed program can be best characterized as \"u rban analysts ,\" who will acquire deep, applied knowledge in how cities, communities, and regions function, especially in the Intermounta in West. Students will develop this expertise through a combination of classroom in struction, experiential learning, community partnerships, undergraduate research, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Graduates who underst and the dynamics of cities and communities will have a competitive advantage in the workforce. Career paths are diverse and include community development coordinators, economic development analysts, nonprofit program coordinators , urban demographers, city managers, and real estate project coordinators . Addit ionally, they will be well prepared for a variety of graduate programs at Boise State University, the University of Idaho, and Idaho State University. Graduates will be able to address urban issues and community development challenges that are relevan t to the Intermountain West using their expertise in (i) urban and regional economics, (ii) public policy and program evaluation, (iii) core urban and regional concepts and their application to the Intermountain West, (iv) infrastructure and community building, ( v) community development analysis, and (vi) public communication strategies . An undergr aduate academic program focused on urban studies makes sense given that most population and economic growth in the United States is concentrated in urban areas and metropolitan regions (Brookin gs Institute 2011). Idaho is often labeled a rural state because of its vast open space, agricultural and forestry industries, and overall low population density, however, it is largely urban when considering demograp hics and economic activity: about 1.45 million or 87% of Idaho's estimated 1.67 million residents live in designated urban areas (See Appendix) . Approximately 1.2 million or 72% of the state 's population live in the metropolitan areas of Boise- Nampa, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho Falls, Twin Falls, Pocatello, and Lewiston (where \"metropolitan\" is defined as a core urban area with a population of 50,000 or more (U.S. Census 2015) . An additional 200,000 people live in the \"micropolitan \" (defined as an urban core with a population of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 ) urban areas of Blackfoot, Rexburg, Burley, Moscow, and Mountain Home. There are also several cross- border urban areas in the state \u2014roughly 50,000 Idahoans live in Payette, Franklin, and Teton Counties, which are part of the Ontario, OR, Logan, UT, and Jackson, WY urban regions Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G., Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance . This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program. All questions must be answered . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 6 Page 3 as defined by the U.S. census (Idaho Department of Commerce 2016) . Academic pr ograms in urban studies often focus on global and industrial cities . Few consider the unique dynamics of cities and communities in the Intermountain West. Boise State University's proposed program will address the cultural, economic, and political factors that frame the Idaho experience with its smaller cities, urban/rural interdependence, geographic isolation, and environmental history. Idaho's public, private, and community organ izations have called for an undergraduate academic program that understands this distinctive context, and where a different reading or analysis of \"urban\" is essential. Boise State University is well positioned to develop this undergraduate program for a number of reasons. Its metropolitan location provides an excellent teaching laboratory for applied learning. Boise and much of Idaho has experienced a population boom in the past 30 years. The Treasure Valley now has half of the state's population, and the Boise-Nampa-Caldwell Metropolit an Statistical Area has grown from about 150,000 to 640,000 between 1980 and 20 16. Regional experts estimate 1 million people in this valley by the year 2030. This makes the Tr easure Valley and other communities in Idaho an ideal place to study urbanization. Boise State University 's proximity to the state capitol and its location in one of the fastest growing regions in the West provides important opportunities for educators to make use of experiential learning, whereby students apply the skills and practices learned in the classroom to real world situations. Boise State University has a number of faculty members with significant expertise across a diverse range of urban and community focused topics. They have collaborated with diverse public a gencies and community organizations to develop sustainability benchmarks, regional public opinion surveys, place-making studies, public program evaluations, strategic investment plans, economic development analyses, project facilitation, and housing policy assessments. The proposed program provides undergraduate research support and gives students the opportunity to apply classroom knowledge to these types of real world projects. The propose d program is of considerable interest to the leaders of Idaho's cities. The following are quotes taken from the letters of support in Appendix C. \"...the creation of this new undergraduate program would support our local workforce through the creation of internships and applied research capstone projects. This is a great opportunity for municipalities to work collaboratively with Boise State University as we create community development professionals, economic development analysts, nonprofit grant writers, and more.\" Tammy de Weerd, Mayor of the City of Meridian \"Idaho continues to grow at a rapid pace, including here in North Idaho. We are challeng ed in Coeur d'Alene and our surrounding cities to ensure we are adequately prepared to address community issues such as land use, transportation, housing, economic development, and more. Public service careers are immensely important in this state, and we need to be able to cr eate the next generation of community government workers by letting Idaho students develop those skills right here in their home state.\" Steve Widmyer, Mayor of the City of Coeur d'Alene INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 7 Page 4 \"As our cities grow it is important to have strong partnerships building better communities and this program will provide tools for both students and municipalities with solution for issues facing local government.\" Garret L. Nancolas, Mayor of the City of Caldwell \"The challenges that face local g overnment in today's world are significant. It will take a new generation of trained professional local government managers to successfully address them. As the baby boomers retire, a growing leadership vacuum is occurring. We need to develop public service leaders at an accelerated pace in order to meet this demand and to support our local workforces.\" Jim Bennett, City Manager, City of Lewiston \"Growth is a critical concern in the City of Eagle and as an elected official, I recognize the importance of this program in developing future talent in our area with real-life experiences in economic development, planning, and the development of policies in our community.\" Stan Ridgeway, Mayor of the City of Eagle \"I am impressed with the broad range of topics that will be included in the program, which will provide students with the tools they need to provide policies and solutions for the increasingly complex issues that face local governments.\" David Sims, Mayor of the City of Bonner's Ferry \"We are in desp erate need of the talent and professionalism the programs within the Boise State University, School of Public Service will bring to the State. Of immediate concern is the need for urban studies and community development. As small communities we are struggling with planning and zoning issues to prepare for future growth that is surely coming to our state.\" Paul Loomis, Mayor of the City of Blackfoot \"A University program and internship would allow a collaborative effort with the City to achieve our common goals of well-informed and law-abiding individuals, qualified local work forc e comprised of college graduates, and public-service leaders for the next several decades. Please contact me to arrange for one of your first internships to be with the City of Middleton.\" Darin Taylor, Mayor, City of Middleton \"Municipalities currently have a difficult time trying to recruit qualified individuals who want to work as public officials. Either the pay is too low or the city must train people while on the job. A new program such as the one being proposed at BSU removes much of the training by the public entity because of the required \"internship\" built into the overall program.\" \"The State of Idaho is slowly losing qualified public officials to th e private sector. The new proposed program at BSU would slow this loss-trend and would enable students to stay in the public sector throughout their career.\" Ryan Smathers, Mayor, City of Orofino \"Currently, I have an intern in my office that is exceptional and is lookin g for training in city planning and community development. We would love to offer him fulltime employment, but now w e must wait as he goes out of state to get the necessary skills and training to fill our job opening. It is a shame we must rely on Utah and surrounding states to educate future Idaho po licy makers.\" Dana Kirkham, Mayor of the City of Ammon, Idaho \"Boise is experiencing tremendous growth and we need dedicated, thoughtful leaders who are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities this growth provides in our area.\" \"Stude nts will work within our community throughout the program, encouraging them to take their skills, knowledge and degree, and give back to our city and state post college.\" David Bieter, Mayor of the City of Boise. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 8 Page 5 2. Need for the Program . Describe the student, regional, and statewide needs that will be addressed by this proposal and address the ways in which the proposed program will meet those needs. a. Workforce need: Provide verification of state workforce needs that will be met by this program. Include State and National Department of Labor research on employment potential. Using the chart below, indicate the total projected annual job openings (including growth and replacement demands in your regional area, the state, and nation. Job openings should represent positions which require graduation from a program such as the one proposed. Data should be derived from a source that can be validated and must be no more than two years old. List the job titles for which this degree is relevant. Provide (as appropriate) additional narrative as to the workforce needs that will be met by the proposed program. Graduates of the proposed program will be prepared for a wide variety of careers that require a deep understanding of the dynamics of urban areas and communities, including community development administrators, economic development analysts, workforce developers, nonprofit program coordinators , urban policy analysts, demographers, city managers, public participation facilitators , historic preservationists, real estate project managers, and city transportation directors to na me a few. Unfortunately, the array of relevant careers do es not map well to the Standard Occupational Classification Code (S OC) job titles in Department of Labor (DOL) data sets. The two tables below (Federal DOL data and State DOL data) are our best attempt at identifying those job titles within those databases for which a BA in Urban Studies and Community Development would be relevant. The resulting estimates of job openings are likely very conservative estimates of actual openings for graduates. Note that these est imates are likely very conservative because of poor correspondence between SOC job titles and careers for graduates of the proposed program.

Student need. What is the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full-time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Document student demand by providing information you have about student interest in the proposed program from inside and outside the institution. If a survey of was used, please attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix A. We anticipate that the USCD program will be attractive to current Boise State University students as a new or second major, as well as a selling point for new applicants that are considering Boise State Un iversity. Additionally, a growing proportion of the university's stud ents are coming from out of state, often from areas that have urban and community development employment opportunities. Thus, the proposed program targets these different audiences and will attract students who ar e interested in public affairs, but seek a broader, more interdisciplinary approach than is offered by existing programs such as Political Science. Many of Boise State University's peer and asp iring institutions hav e programs similar to the proposed BA Urban Studies and Community Development . As an examp le, Portland State University offers two programs similar to that proposed: a BA in Community Development and a Masters in Urban Studies. Together those programs have a total enrollment of about 400 students. This proposed program responds to strong undergraduate interest in urban studies and community d evelopment courses as demonstrated by steady enrollments shown in the table below . Included are special topics courses and workshops that have covered a variety of thematic areas, including sustainability, economic development, community development, architectural hist ory, civic engagement, creative placemaking, and mass media. A sample of these courses, include Boise: History, Politics and Urban Renewal ; City, Suburb and Region ; Sustainable Cities ; New Urbanism ; Urban Nightmares: Postwar Film Noir ; Gothic Boise Architecture ; City Beautiful and the Urban Aesthetic; Historic Preservation and Public Art ; and Food in the City .

Popular programs include the Investigate Boise series of experiential classes that relate history a nd politics to economic development. Students write a peer-reviewed essay for publication on commerce, conservation, transportation, and urban renewal. In another example, Food and the City brought together 65 students in a one-credit workshop to discuss food politics, economic growth, and community development. The intensive session featured food experts and urban and regiona l practitioners from Idaho who discussed the important connection between urban life and agricultur al communities. c. Economic Need : Describe how the proposed program will act to stimulate the state economy by advancing the field, providing research results, etc. As Idaho and the Intermountain West is becoming more urbanized with population projections showing substantial growth over the next thirty years, there is a need for urban analysts who understand the economic context for growth and development. Additionally, these urban analysts w ill need to have the job skills that enable them to work with various public, private, INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 11 Page 8 and community partners on developing capacity and identifying solutions for the unique challenges facing the region. The p rogram's em phasis on innovation, workforce readiness, and civic engagement is designed to fulfill and target this economic need through its connection betwee n academic foundations and applied work . d. Societal Need : Describe additional societal benefits and cultural benefits of the program. The USCD program supports the university's mandate to provide education in public affairs. The program is skills-driven and designed to produce urban analysts rather than graduates who have basic or general knowledge about urban studies and community development. Job placement and car eer development in related fields relies on strong communication skills, rigorous evaluation and analytical abilities, context comprehension, and application abilities. These core skills anchor the program and its focus on communities in the Intermountain West. This progr ammatic philosophy results in developing trained workers and citizens who have the skills and k nowledge to analyze communities and regions where they are able to identify and implement soluti ons for urban challenges. e.

Internship: All students in the USCD program will be required to complete a 3-credit internship in order to apply classroom knowledge and to gain exposure to collaborating with public, pr ivate, and community organizations on program related topics. 3. Cornerstone: All students are required to complete a 1-credit cornerstone course before they enroll in a Capstone project. The course focuses on professional development through short, intensive sessions on project management and furthering communication skills. 4. Capstone: All students are required to complete a 3-credit Finishing Foundations course as part of their university curriculum requirements and their USCD requirements. Students will have a choice to either work on an individual or group project. The Capstone is their culminating work where they apply classroom and experiential learning to a community development project. 5. Urban Studies and Community Development Electives: All students are required to take 18 credits in one of seven areas that correspond with different job possibilities, including Urban Sustainab ility; Urban Society and Comparative Cultures; Economic Development and Regional Growth ; Urban Analytics ; Urban Arts and Creative Placemaking; Social Justice and Community Building; Healthy Cities; Leadership in Local, Regional, and State Government; Urban Emergency Management; and Self-Design. These different areas also represent faculty expertise across the university an d allow students to deepen their knowledge and skill sets in particular areas. 11. Program Intended Learning Outcomes and Connection to Curriculum. a. Intended Learning Outcomes. List the Intended Learning Outcomes for the proposed program, using learner-centered statements that indicate what will students know, be able to do, and value or appreciate as a result of completing the program. The Program Intended Learning Outcomes are grounded in the Mission of the Urban Studies and Community Development Program in the School of Public Service, which reads as follows: Urban S tudies and Community Development at Boise State University relates the past to the future INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 16 Page 13 of cities, their politics and economics, their environmental and cultural trends. Its nature is multidisciplinary and experiential. Its objective is to nurture the ideas and skills highly prized in urban and community development professions. Its purpose is to inform planning and policymaking, to foster equity and social welfare, to seed civic engagement through democratic participation, to empower and inspire. Program Intended Learning Outcomes Boise State University students who graduate from the Urban Studies and Community Development p rogram are well positioned to help shape our cities and grow our communities. Students t hat complete this program will be able to: 1. Explain why it is important to study urban and metropolitan regions and their inhabitants 2. Identi fy the community development challenges facing urban and regional communities 3. Explai n how political, economic, and cultural forces provide structure to urban society 4. Describe how g lobal and local conditions interact to shape urban environments 5. Identify the stakeholders, institutions, and public policies that influence community growth and declin e 6. Analyze the well-being of urban communities and their constituencies 7. Analyze the roles of social justice and diversity in communiti es, citie s and regions 8. Assess and apply relevant solutions for complex urban and community problems 9. Develop commu nication strategies for sharing and disseminating information and research 10. Demonstrate the ability to work in team settings and collaborate with community groups 11. Reflect on how urban studies and community development informs the understanding and practice of public service 12. Assessment plans a. Assessment Process. Describe the assessment process that will be used to evaluate how well students are achieving the intended learning outcomes of the program. Working with Boise State University 's Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) , the program team develop ed and adopt ed evidence-based practice for program assessment. The team designe d a curriculum map to make explicit the relationship between the learning outcomes of the progr am and the core curriculum (see Appendix). The map identifies what courses \"introduce, emphasize, and reinforce\" each learning objective. The assessment plan involves the following strategies: First, Urban Studies and Community Development facu lty members will design and embed signature assignments and evaluation rubrics in specific courses to determine whethe r students have met ea ch learning outcome. Second, facu lty members will create a student survey to assess student perceptions of the extent to which pr ogram learning outcomes have been supported by the program. As the program matures, faculty members will design an alumni and employer survey to determine if the program aligns with what is desired by the job market in terms of employment readiness. The assessment process will follow a 3-year cycle. At the end of each academic year, faculty INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 17 Page 14 members will evaluate a specific sub-s et of learning outcomes using the signature assignments for each targeted learning outcome. In some cases, this may involve reviewing work from all students in a course. In others, it will draw on samples of strong, medium, and weak student work . An example: in order to assess the extent to which the program is succeeding at supporting LO #6 (Analyze the well-being of urban communities and their constituencies) student work on two signa ture assignments will be reviewed. Based on the attached curriculum map, these would be drawn from each USCD: Urban Infrastructure (research paper) and from the capstone course (student final project report). Student work will also be drawn from appropriate elective courses. A rubric which explicates strong, moderate and still- emerging st udent learning will be used to assess student work to determine what percentage of the program's s tudents are demonstrating learning at the different levels. This work will be done at the annual assessment retreat. Discussion of results will illuminate areas in which the program is doing well and areas that need improvement with respect to LO#6. Each year, this process will address 3-4 of the outcomes. In the first few years, since the program is new, the assessment team will use this process to spot-ch eck learning outcomes across the curriculum to evaluate how well the program is meeting the i ntended program outcomes. b. Clos ing the loop. How will you ensure that the assessment findings will be used to improve the program? At an annual retreat, USCD faculty members and affiliates will evaluate the aggregate results of direct and indirect measures used to assess the targeted learning outcomes. Participants will discuss chang es moving forward and document specific changes to courses or the curriculum that will be e nacted in the coming year. The USCD Program Coordinator will report the retreat findings an d response to the Dean and Associate Dean of the School of Public Service. c. Measures used. What direct and indirect measures will be used to assess student learning? Direct measures for assessing achievement of course learning objectives and program outcomes will be signature assignments. USCD faculty members will develop rubrics and scoring systems for assessment to ensure consistency across courses and faculty members. Indirect measures i nclude two parts. First, student surveys will be administered to assess student p erceptions about the program, specifically what skills and abilities do students believe they learn ed. S econd, alumni and a sample of urban and community development employers will be surveyed every three years to ensure a continuous improvement loop from industry and community partners. This survey will ensure that the proposed program is adequately preparing students to enter the urban studies and community development field, and will help identify any missing areas . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 18 Page 15 d. Timing and frequency . When will assessment activities occur and at what frequency? The assessment activities will occur on a 3-year cycle. Every academic year, a set of learning objectives will be identified to evaluate . Work cond ucted at a faculty retreat will analyze the findings an d develop changes or modifications to the curriculum or signature assignments based on the results and analysis of the evaluation data. Enrollments and Graduates 13. Existing similar programs at Idaho Public Institutions. Using the chart below, provide enrollments and numbers of graduates for similar existing programs at your institution and other Idaho public institutions. There are no similar undergraduate programs at the other Idaho public institutions. 14. Projec tions for proposed program: Using the chart below, provide projected enrollments and number of graduates for the proposed program: 15. Describe the methodology for determining enrollment and graduation projections. Refer to information provided in Question #2 \"Need\" above. What is the capacity for the program? Describe your recruitment efforts? How did you determine the projected numbers above? Existing Similar Programs: Historical enrollments and graduate numbers Institution and Program Name Fall Headcount Enrollment in Program Number of Graduates From Program (Summer, Fall, Spring) Projected Enrollments and Graduates First Five Years Program Name: Urban Studies and Community Development Projected Fall Term Headcount Enrollment in Program Projected Annual Number of Graduates From Program FY 18 (first year) FY 19 FY 20 FY 21 FY 22 FY 19 FY 20 FY 21 FY 22 FY 23 20 40 60 80 100 120 0 0 4 8 12 16 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 19 Page 16 We conservatively estimate that the program will reach an enrollment of 80 students by the 4th year and 120 by the 6th year. We estimate the annual number of graduates as one-sixth of the number of enrolled students. Those estimates are based on the following: We believe that our new program eventually will have enrollments that will fall between our BA in Environmental Studies program (enrollments ~120; ~30 graduates per year) and BS in Political Science (enrollments ~ 250 to 300 ; ~75 g raduates per year). Portland State University, an institution with many similarities to Boise State University, offers a program similar to that proposed: Community Development, with an enrollment of about 150 students. The proposed program will take a number of years to attain similar numbers, and growth in the number of graduates will lag behind growth in the number of students. Our recruitment efforts include: USCD faculty teaching UF 100: Cities of Tomorrow every semester for 3 years. This 200- person class w ill be the primary feeder for the initial development of the program. SPS faculty offering several urban and community development workshops through the SPS to recr uit students. Students are drawn to the applied nature of these courses, which give them access to exp eriential learning opportunities and to community experts who have dee p practical knowledge. SPS launch ing a social media marketing campaign and raising community awareness with the recent hires of a p art-time marketing expert and external relations and development manager. USCD faculty work ing with the university-wide recruiters to educate them about the program so that they are better able to direct students who are interested in urban studies and community development . SPS faculty engaging in several local, regional, and statewide community development proje cts that support applied research and develop grassroots support for the proposed progr am. 16. Minimum Enrollments and Graduates. Have you determined minimums that the program will need to meet in order to be continued? What are those minimums, what is the logical basis for those minimums, what is the time frame, and what is the action that would result? During Program Prioritization, Boise State Uni versity established a \"flagging\" threshold of 10 baccalaureate graduates per degree program per year. Programs performing below that threshold were required to take actions to increase the number of graduates. We continue to apply the same threshold to new programs; therefore a minimum of 10 graduates per year must be achie ved. It will likely take 5 years to achieve that number. We estimate that to produce 10 graduates a year will require a standing enrollment of approximately 50 students. Once our new Incentive-based budget model is implemented, it will be up to the Dean of the School of Public Service to ensure that the numbers of enrollees justify the continuation of the program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 20 Page 17 As a second way of measuring program viability, we will analyze three additional indicators of program success: community impact, job placement, and graduate school placement. The community impact measure is important given that the program is housed within the School of Public Service, which prioritizes engaged learning and applied research to support community development. US CD faculty will work with the Dean and Associate Dean of the SPS to develop a community assessment rubric. The job placement indicators highlight where program graduates land and what skills they use in their careers. An alumni survey will help track program gr aduates and job fit so that the program can tailor the curriculum to meet what urban analysts need as they start and develop their careers. While graduates have many career options, it is likely th at some will pursue graduate education. This indicator will help us identify whether the program acts as a graduate school feeder. We will track all three indicators and make improvements in the program as necessary. Resources Required for Implementation - fiscal impact and budget 17. Physical Resources. a. Existing resources . Describe equipment, space, laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other physical equipment presently available to support the successful implementation of the program. No additional physical resources are necessary. b. Impact of new program . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of physical resources by the proposed program? How will the increased use be accommodated? No additional physical resources are necessary. c. Needed resources. List equipment, space, laboratory instruments, etc., that must be obtained to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those physical resources into the budget sheet. No additional physical resources are necessary. 18. Library resources a. Existing resources and impact of new program . Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present program? Will there be an impact on existing programs of increased library usage caused by the proposed program? For off-campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. Existing library support is adequate for the operation of the proposed program. b. Neede d resources . What new library resources will be required to ensure successful INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 21 Page 18 implementation of the program? Enter the costs of those library resources into the budget sheet. No new library resources are required. 19. Personnel resources a. Give an overview of the personnel resources that will be needed to implement the program. How many additional sections of existing courses will be needed? Referring to the list of new courses to be created, what instructional capacity will be needed to offer the necessary number of sections? b. Describe the existing instructional, support, and administrative resources that can be brought to bear to support the successful implementation of the program. c. List the new personnel that must be hired to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those personnel resources into the budget sheet. The proposed program is designed to make extensive use of existing Boise State faculty and coursewor k already being taught. Additional capacity will be provided by the two faculty lines that have been devoted to the Urban Studies and Community Development program. Both of these moves are included in the budget. Both derive from our continued application of the principles of Program Prioritization as the basis for decisions about resource allocation. The resources necessary for one line result from reallocation of funding from the discontinued Master of Community and Regional Planning program. The second line results from the reallocation of one faculty line from the Department of History to the School of Public Service. The addition of the above two lines will enable us to get the BA in Urban Studies and Community Development up and running. We anticipate, however, that interest in the program will outstrip those addit ional resources. We therefore have requested additional resources in our FY18 Line Item Request to the Legislature; we anticipate that 2.0FTE from that request will be assigned to the proposed program. d. Impact on existing programs . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of existing personnel resources by the proposed program? How will quality and productivity of existing programs be maintained? There will be little if any impact on existing programs given the investment of additional resources described above. 20. Revenue Sources a) Reallocation of funds: If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropriated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? One faculty line associated with the proposed program will be funded by reallocating resources INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 22 Page 19 that were freed up when the Department of Community and Regional Planning and its associated Master's p rogram were discontinued. One faculty line associated with the proposed program resulted from the reallocation of a faculty line from the Department of History in the College of Arts and Sciences to the School of Public Service. b) New appropriation . If an above Maintenance of Current Operations (MCO) appropriation is required to fund the program, indicate when the institution plans to include the program in the legislative budget request. Boise State University requested funding for a \"Public Service Initiative\" as one of our FY2018 Line Item Requests to the Idaho State Legislature. Two of the eight faculty lines requested in that initiative will be devoted to the proposed program. c) Non-ongoing sources : i. If the funding is to come from one-time sources such as a donation, indicate the sources of other funding. What are the institution's plans for sustaining the program when that funding ends? ii. Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) that will be valid to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? d) Student Fees : i. If the proposed program is intended to levy any institutional local fees, explain how doing so meets the requirements of Board Policy V.R., 3.b. ii. Provide estimated cost to students and total revenue for self-support programs and for professional fees and other fees anticipated to be requested under Board Policy V.R., if applicable. 21. Using the budget template provided by the Office of the State Board of Education, provide the following information: Indicate all resources needed including the planned FTE enrollment, projected revenues, and estimated expenditures for the first four fiscal years of the program. Include reallocation of existing personnel and resources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars. Amounts should reconcile subsequent pages where budget explanations are provided. If the program is contract related, explain the fiscal sources and the year- to-year commitment from the contracting agency(ies) or party(ies). Provide an explanation of the fiscal impact of any proposed discontinuance to include impacts to faculty (i.e., salary savings, re-assignments).

This program would be a great benefit to municipalities in Idaho, and I urge you to support this program. It is challenging for municipalities to find employees that have relevant education, and this program will help to fulfill this need by addressing the issues and challenges that face communities in Idaho. I am impressed with the broad range of topics that will be included in the program, which will provide students with the tools they need to provide policies and solutions for the increasingly complex issues that face local governments. Of particular interest is the requirement for an internship as part of the proposed program. This would not only be a benefit for the student, it would also be a opportunity for local governments to work collaboratively with Boise State University. I encourage you to support this program to provide the future public service leaders for Idaho.

This program would be important to the growth of our community, as it would develop public service leaders and a local workforce. Boise is experiencing tremendous growth and we need dedicated, thoughtful leaders who are ready to take on the challenges and opportunities this growth provides in our area. The capstone of the proposed Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies and Community Development is an engaged research project that would provide an opportunity for local governments to work collaboratively with Boise State. This partnership would not only benefit the city, but the state as a whole. Students will w ork within our community throughout the program , encouraging them to take their skills, knowledge and degree, and give back to our city and state post college. Boise State's partnership with the City of Boise would be deepened through the creation of this new program. Please consider the City of Boise 's strong support for the Bachelor of Arts in Urban Studies and Community Development pro gram at Boise State University as you consider this proposal. Sincerely, David H. Bieter Mayor INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 6 Page 42INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 1 BOISE STATE UNIVERSITY SUBJECT New Master of Athletic Training Program APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Governi ng Policies & Procedures, Section III.G. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University (BSU) proposes to create a new program that will award a Master of Athletic Traini ng degree. BSU has offered an accredited Bachelor of Science in Athletic Training for 34 year s, and transition to a master's level program is being required by the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education. The proposed program will be offered face-to-face in BSU's regional service area. Although many graduates fr om the proposed program wil l enter into Athletic Training positions, others will find employm ent in jobs that include high school teachers with responsibilities for athletic training, athletic in structors, fitness trainers, and orthopedic equi pment salespersons. Addi tionally, the program is excellent preparation fo r professional schools th at graduate physicians, physician's assistants, ph ysical therapists, etc. The extensive clinical training included in athletic training program necessitates face-to-face offering of the program and requires the offering institution develop extensive ties to local clinical site s and other stakeholders in the area. The proposed new program will co ntinue BSU's long standing offering of athletic training degrees in the Treasure Valley, which contains the largest portion of Idaho's population. Norther n Idaho is served by the Un iversity of Idaho, which recently transitioned from a baccalaureate program to a master's level athletic training program; it additional ly offers a Doctor of At hletic Training degree. Eastern Idaho is served by Idaho State University's recently-created master's level program. BSU's athletic training pr ogram is located in the College of Health Sciences, where it joins nursing, radiol ogic science, respiratory care, and social work in the array of programs in the co llege; it therefore contribut es to the diversity of interaction available for faculty members and students. The proposed program will commence summe r of 2018. The program will be 24 months in duration, tota ling 50 academic credits, and will include six semesters (including summers) of clinical practice for athletic training. The program will admit an initial cohor t of 10-12 students annually, with the potential growth to 15 students annually. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 2 IMPACT Two faculty members and one graduate assistant who now teach in the bachelor's level program will be assigned to the master's le vel program. One additional faculty member will be funded using resources reallocated within the College of Health Sciences. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Master of Athlet ic Training program proposal Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS As provided in the program proposal, the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE) announced in May 2015 that t he entry-level Athletic Training degree level will be changing from a baccalaureate to a master's level. Fall 2022 will be the last allowed adm ission to an accredited undergraduate athletic training program. The creation of the proposed program represents the second step of transitioning degree levels. Currently, Idaho State University offers a Master of Science in Athletic Training, which was created to meet a specific demonstrated need in Eastern Idaho for athletic trainers at the secondary school leve l as well as for other athletic health care personnel. The University of Idaho al so offers a Master of Science in Athletic Training, which prepares individu als to work in cons ultation with, and under the supervision of physicians to pr event and treat sports injuries and associated conditions. BSU proposes to admit a cohort of 10-12 students annually, with a potential growth to a cohort size of 15 students depending on availability of academic and physical resources. Proj ected enrollments were det ermined using existing capacity, based on existing perso nnel and infrastruc ture, and which is limited to cohorts of 12 and a total enrollment of 24. BSU's request to create a new Master of At hletic Training is consistent with their Service Region Program Responsibilities and their Five-year Plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in Region III. Cons istent with Board Policy III.Z, no institution has the statewid e program responsibility for athletic training programs. The proposal went through the program review process and was recommended for approval by the Council on Academ ic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) on November 17, 2016 and to the Board's on Instructi on, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) committee on December 1, 2016. Staff believes that there is sufficient ju stification, based on regional need, for BSU to create the proposed program. Board staff recommends approval. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 3 BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Boise State University to create a new academic program that will awar d a Master of Athletic Training in substantial conformance to the program proposal submitted as Attachment 1. Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 4 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 5 Page 2 Rationale for Creation or Modification of the Program 1. Describe the request and give an overview of the changes that will result. Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Identify any existing program that this program will replace. Boise State University proposes the creation of a program that will award a Master of Athletic Training degree, and will complete our tr ansition from the baccalaureate level to the masters lev el as required by the accrediting body for athletic training. To become certified as an Athletic Trainer, a student must graduate from an accredited degree program. In May 2015 The Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education (CAATE), along with strategic alliance partners, announced the decision to change the entry-level Athletic Training (AT) degree level from a baccalaureate level to a Master s level. Fall 2022 will be the last allowed admission to an accredited undergraduate athletic training program. This decision came after two and a half years of critical examination of what the best professional d egree level should be to prepare Athletic Trainers in the evolving healthcare system. Boise Sta te is therefore transitioning its existing Bachelor's degree in AT to a Master of Athletic Training (MAT). We have therefore discontinued our bachelor degree program with the last cohor t admitted in Fall 2016. That last cohort must graduate in Athletic Training during Spring 20 19 to remain eligible for national certification as an AT. The proposed MAT program will have a Summer 2018 start. There will, therefore, be a one year overl ap of the BS AT and the MAT in 2018-19, with program accreditation transitioning to the Master's level in 2019. We also plan to create (via a separate proposal) a new emphasis in Pre-Athletic Training in our BS in Kinesiology degree. That emphasis will be part of an accelerated 3+2 MAT program. The following table depicts the timing of transition. Timeline BS Athletic Training (BS AT) Master of Athletic Training (MAT) Fall, 2015 - Submit proposal for discontinuation - Ongoing notifications to existing and prospec tive students Fall, 2016 Last BS AT Cohort begins the program Submit proposal for MAT and new Pre - AT emphasis in BS Kinesiology degree (an accelerated 3+2 plan) to SBOE Spr, 2017 Submit Notice of Intent to transition AT degree to CAATE (accreditation b ody) Fall, 2017 Initiate recruitment for new MAT Spr, 2018 - Current CAATE accred . cycle ends - Re-accredit BS AT for one year Sum , 2018 First MAT cohort begins Spr, 2019 Final BS AT cohort graduates Gain accreditation for master's prog. Spr, 202 0 First MAT cohort graduates Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G., Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance . This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 6 Page 3 The proposed MAT will continue Boise State University's tradition of excellence in preparing athleti c trainers for entry-level practice in positions in high school, collegiate, professional, industrial settings, and for other employment opportunities providing healthcare for the p hysically active. Many local and regional employers have sought out Boise State 's Athletic Training graduates over the years. Graduates are also employed throughout the country in a variety of settings from professional sports to the manufacturing industry. Importantly, the first- atte mpt pass rate for Boise State graduates taking the Board of Certification examination is 97% , which is well above the national average of 81%. Th e curriculum for the proposed MAT was developed from the CAATE accreditation guidelines and the National Athletic Trainers' Association Education Competencies for athletic training education. The program will be 24 months in duration, totaling 50 academic credits. The cur riculum will span six semesters (summer, fall, spring) and will include six semesters of clini cal practice for athletic training. We plan to admit a cohort of 10-12 students annually with pote ntial growth to 15 students depending on availability of academic and physical resources. 2. Need for the Program . Describe the student, regional, and statewide needs that will be addressed by this proposal and address the ways in which the proposed program will meet those needs. a. Workforce need: Provide verification of state workforce needs that will be met by this program. Include State and National Department of Labor research on employment potential. Using the chart below, indicate the total projected annual job openings (including growth and replacement demands in your regional area, the state, and nation. Job openings should represent positions which require graduation from a program such as the one proposed. Data should be derived from a source that can be validated and must be no more than two years old. List the job titles for which this degree is relevant: 1. Athletic Trainer (Note that graduates of the proposed programs are qualified for a number of additional jobs such as high school teacher with athletic training responsibilities, fitness coach, etc. In addition, graduates will be well qualified to pursue the additional education required for positions such as Physician Assistant. ) State DOL data Federal DOL data Other data source: ( describe) Local ( Service Area ) 4 26 (50% of state) State 7 52 (0.5% of national) Nation 10,400 Provide (as appropriate) additional narrative as to the workforce needs that will be met by the proposed program. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics \"employment for athletic trainers is projected to grow 21% from 2014 to 2024, much faster than the average for all occupations.\" The n eed for INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 7 Page 4 prevention and care of injuries and neurologic conditions incurred from physical activity in sport and in work is expected to continue to create additional demand for athletic trainers. A recent sea rch of the National Athletic Training Association job posting site revealed 640 Athletic Trainer job announcements (August 26, 2016). The Idaho Department of Labor database indicates organizations and institutions in Ada and Can yon county employ the majority of Athletic Trainers in the state of Idaho: total employment of A thletic Trainers in Idaho (Idaho DOL) was 100, Southwestern Idaho accounted for 80% of all employment in the state. Although many graduates from the proposed program will enter into Athletic Training positions, others will find employment in jobs not listed as Athletic Trainers in the DOL data. These jobs include high school teachers with additional responsibilities for athletic training, athletic instructors, fitness trainers, and orthopedic equipment salespersons. Additionally, some studen ts may continue to professional school to pursue careers as physicians, physicians assistants, physical therapists, etc. The following tables provides data from the Idaho DOL and from the US Dep artment of Labor Statistics on job openings that are projected to occur in those occupations.

Student need. What is the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full- time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Document student demand by providing information you have about student interest in the proposed program from inside and outside the institution. If a survey of s was used, please attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix A. There are two primary sources of expected student demand. The first is new and existing underg raduate students at Boise State University. The BS in Athletic Training has consistently filled its cohort capacity each year, and we anticipate many of these students will continue to be interested in pursuing the athletic training profession. We will facilitate the entry of undergraduate students into the profession with a new emphasis in our BS Kinesiology program: \"Pre - Athletic Training, \" which will be created in the next year . Other emphases in the BS in INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 8 Page 5 Kinesiology program will also serve as a source of students for the proposed MAT program. We will also d evelop an accelerated Master's (3+2) program to provide an attractive option for entry into the proposed MAT program for Boise State students. Second , we anticipate that baccalaureate graduates from outside of Idaho will be interested in the pr oposed MAT program. For example, over half of current BS in Athletic Training students come fr om outside of Idaho. Additionally, there is increasing interest in from Japanese students as ev idenced by a large number of inquiries from the country. Our strong track record and high v alue placed on clinical training will make the proposed MAT program at Boise State an attractive option for students inside, and out of the country. c. E conomic Need : Describe how the proposed program will act to stimulate the state economy by advancing the field, providing research results, etc. N/A d. Societal Need : Describe additional societal benefits and cultural benefits of the program. N/A e. If Associate's degree, transferability : N/A 3. Similar Programs. Identify similar programs offered within Idaho and in the region by other in- state or bordering state colleges/universities. Similar Programs offered by Idaho public institutions (list the proposed program as well) Institution Name Degree name and Level Program Name and brief description if warranted BSU Bachelor's (existing) Master's (proposed) BS in Athletic Training Master of Athletic Training ISU Master's MS in Athletic Training UI Bachelor's Master's Doctoral BSPE in Athletic Training MS in Athletic Training Doctor of Athletic Training INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 9 Page 6 Similar Programs offered by other Idaho institutions and by institutions in nearby states Institution Name Degree name and Level Program Name and brief description if warranted Pacific University Master of Science in Athletic Training (MSAT) The Pacific University athletic training program offers an entry -level master of science degree in athletic training. University of Montana Master of Athletic Training (MAT) A two -year master's program designed for students who already have a baccalaureate degree. Weber State Master of Science in Athletic Training (MSAT) A two -year program for students who do not currently possess a Bachelor's in Athletic Training. 4. Justification for Duplication with another institution listed above. (if applicable). If the proposed program is similar to another program offered by an Idaho public institution, provide a rationale as to why any resulting duplication is a net benefit to the state and its citizens. Describe why it is not feasible for existing programs at other institutions to fulfill the need for the proposed program. The creation of the proposed program completes the necessary transition of an existing and highly successful bachelor's -level program to a master's level program. Therefore, no increase in duplication will result from approval of this proposal. Boise State University has had a nationally accredited Athletic Training program at the underg raduate level for 34 years. There has been and will continue to be demand for the program at Boise State. The hands-on nature of the program necessitates the face- to-face offering of the program. The extensive clinical training included in the program requires the extensive clinical affiliations in the Trea sure Valley that the Boise S tate's athletic training program has developed. Because the Treasure Valley contains the largest portion of Idaho's population , it is important to continue to offer the program to place-bound students in the area and it is important that the program be offer ed by the institution with extensive ties to local clinical sites and other stakeholders in the area. In addition, Boise State University's Ath letic training programs program are housed in the College of Health Sciences, whereas other programs in the state are housed in the College of Education. Alignment with a health sciences college provides students and faculty members with opportunities for interaction with other health-related professions. 5. Describe how this request supports the institution's vision and/or strategic plan. The following bolded passages show the relevance of the program to Boise State University's Mission: INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 10 Page 7 Boise State University is a public, metropolitan, research university offering an array of undergraduate and graduate degrees and experiences that foster student success, lifelong learning, community engagement, innovation and creativity . Research and creative activity advance new knowledge and benefit students, the community, the state and the nation. As an integral part of its metropolitan environment the university is engaged in professional and continuing education programming, policy issues, and promoting the regio n's economic vitality and cultural enrichment. Goals of Institution Strategic Plan Proposed Program Plans to Achieve the Goal Goal 1 - Create a signature, high -quality educational experience for all students. The integrated curriculum will be delivered by faculty and staff with extensive clinical and teaching experience. Partnerships with other programs in the College of Health Sciences allows for inter -professional education al opportunities and access to cutting edge facilities and equipment both on an d off campus. Goal 4 - Align university program and activities with community needs. The extensive clinical training included in the program creates extensive involvement of students in the community : they provide a needed service to many organizations and institutions in the surrounding area. Nearly 10,000 total clock hours of supervised clinical experiences are produced by Athletic Training students each year. 6. Assurance of Quality. Describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program. Describe the institutional process of program review. Where appropriate, describe applicable specialized accreditation and explain why you do or do not plan to seek accreditation. The following measures will ensure the high quality of the proposed program: Regional Institutional Accreditation: Boise State University is regionally accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities (NWCCU). Regional accreditation of the universit y has been continuous since initial accreditation was conferred in 1941. Boise State Univer sity is currently accredited at all degree levels (A, B, M, D). Program Review: Internal program evaluations will take place every five years as part of the normal departmental review process conducted by the Office of the Provost. This process requires a detailed self-study (including outcome assessments) and a comprehensive review and site visit by external evaluators. Graduate Policy and Procedure: The proposed program will adhere to all applicable policies and procedures of the Graduate College as developed and approved by the graduate faculty of the university through its representatives on the Graduate Council. Specialized Accreditation: The program will seek continued program accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Athletic Training Education which includes a yearly annual report (CAATE). In the most recent comprehensive review (2008) the undergraduate Athletic Training program received continuing accreditation for ten years, which is the maximum awarded by CAATE. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 11 Page 8 7. In accordance with Board Policy III.G., an external peer review is required for any new doctoral program. Attach the peer review report as Appendix B . N/A 8. Teacher Education/Certification Programs All Educator Preparation programs require review from the Professional Standards Commission (PSC) and approval from the Board. In addition to the proposal form, the Program Approval Matrix ( Appendix C ) is required for any new and modifications to teacher education/certification programs, including endorsements. The matrix must be submitted with the proposal to OSBE and SDE using the online academic program system as one document. N/A 9. Five-Year Plan: Is the proposed program on your institution's approved 5-year plan? Indicate below. Yes x No Curriculum, Intended Learning Outcomes, and Assessment Plan 10. Curriculum for the proposed program and its delivery. The proposed curriculum for the MAT has been developed from the CAATE accreditation guid elines and the National Athletic Trainers' As sociation (NATA) Education Competencies for athletic training education. The program will be 24 months in duration totaling 50 academic credits. The curriculum will include six semesters (summer, fall, spring) including six semesters of clini cal practice for athletic training. The program plans to admit a cohort of 10-12 students annually with potential growth to 15 students pending increases in academic and physical resources. Admittance to this program is on a competitive basis much like other professional healthcar e degree programs. The curriculum will be a face- to-face model with opportunities to crea te hybrid or full online classes . a. Summary of requirements. Provide a summary of program requirements using the following table. Credit hours in requi red courses offered by the department (s) offering the program. 50 Credit hours in required courses offered by other departments : 0 Credit hours in institutional general education curriculum 0 Credit hours in f ree electives 0 Total credit hours requir ed for degree program: 50 b. Additional requirements. Describe additional requirements such as comprehensive examination, senior thesis or other capstone experience, practicum, or internship, some of which may carry credit hours included in the list above. Clinical education requirements for this program are immersive in nature. Through six different clinical based classes, students will be assigned to various clinical rotations with both on and off INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 12 Page 9 campus facilities that provide a spectrum of health care needs for physically active populations. Boise Sta te prides itself on focusing attention to hands-on experience, which results in real, \"live\", pa tient interactions and decision-making . Three courses highlight the research portion of the MAT curriculum. Current Evidence and T opics in Athletic Training will require students to explore current trends in the practice and research in the field of athletic training and health care. Next, in a graduate seminar setting, students will present current evidence in an inter-professional setting. Finally, in a culminat ing research project, students will produce and present an evidence based clinical research study. 11. P rogram Intended Learning Outcomes and Connection to Curriculum. a. Intended Learning Outcomes. List the Intended Learning Outcomes for the proposed program, using learner-centered statements that indicate what will students know, be able to do, and value or appreciate as a result of completing the program. 1). Graduates of this program will demonstrate the knowledge and skills of a highly qualified, productive, and employable Athletic Trainer. 1.1 Describe and demonstrate the requisite knowledge and skills (by cohort level) of injury prevention and management, clinical examination and diagnosis, and therapeutic interventions needed to treat injuries and illnesses of the patient. 1.2 Demonstrate the use of evidence-based practice techniques by analyzing and applying current evidence in the field of medicine. 1.3 Comprehend and demonstrate the appropriate uses of modern equipment and technology utilized in Athletic Training. 2). Graduates from this program will pursue life-long learning, which informs clinical practice shaped by the University's shared values: Academic excellence, caring, citizensh ip, fairness, respect, responsibility, and trustworthiness. 2.1 Model professional behaviors defined by the NATA Code of Ethics and the BOC Standards of Professional Practice when implementing a patient centered care approach aligned with clinical based goals. 2.2 Demonstrate effective communication (verbal and written) with a variety of health care practitioners and other members of the health care team. 2.3. Comprehend and demonstrate the rationale for professional continuing education in the field of athletic training. 12. A ssessment plans a. Assessment Process. Describe the assessment process that will be used to evaluate how well students are achieving the intended learning outcomes of the program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 13 Page 10 Assessment of learning outcome 1 is achieved foremost through a competency based evaluation program, which is progressive through all six clinical practice courses. Progression of skill and know ledge attainment in this model begins with instruction, followed by repetitive student pr actice and culminates with demonstration of skill mastery, or a student demonstrating a skill or acq uired knowledge at a level of entry level clinician. Integrated proficiencies are evaluated using a very similar process but is conducted in \"real time\" field experiences. Each course in the MAT curriculum utilizes learning outcomes relative to the content of the individual course. Course outcomes are evaluated utilizing the most appropriate assessment method for the content based on best practices (e.g. oral practical exams, scenario based evaluat ion, evidence review papers, examination, and mock national certification examinations). Evaluation of learning outcome 2 is achieved primarily through alumni employer surveys which are conducted each year for graduates of the program. In addition, preceptor feedback given multiple times a year through clinical education experiences assess each student 's character traits (e.g. ethical behavior, communication ability with preceptors and other health care providers, interpersonal relationships). b. Closing the loop. How will you ensure that the assessment findings will be used to improve the program? Each year the program will solicit feedback from various entities regarding strengths and weakness of the program. Several times a year both students and preceptors provide valuable feed back regarding the program especially the clinical education portion . This information is assessed by program leadership to make both immediate and long term modifications to the pr ogram to facilitate positive growth necessary to reach or exceed stated program goals and outcomes. Graduating students are surveyed annually about student satisfaction regarding all facets of the pr ogram. Results of this survey are reviewed amongst the faculty and changes and/o r adjustments are made to improve areas of weaknesses and areas of strength may be bolstered. Finally, information from alumni employer surveys allow faculty to assess information from a valuable perspective outside of the institution. This information is especially beneficial to evaluate soft skills of our graduates that can be addressed throughout the degree program. c. Measures used. What direct and indirect measures will be used to assess student learning? Direct measures aligned with learning outcome 1 include: presentations, objective clinical structured exams and examinations. Indirect measures aligned with learning outcome 2 include: preceptor evaluations, student evaluations of preceptors, alumni surveys, and alumni employer surveys. d. Timing and frequency . When will assessment activities occur and at what frequency ? In addition to course evaluations, preceptor and student evaluations are ongoing throughout the year. To close the loop on the assessment plan, faculty meet annually to discuss findings of indirect measures and then on a bi-weekly basis throughout the academic year. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 14 Page 11 Another round of annual assessment occurs during the annual report for accreditation renewal each year. The Boise State undergraduate program has maintained continuous national approval or accreditation since 1982. The current accreditation will transition to the master 'sdegree level with similar annual assessment expectations as the undergraduate degree. Enrollments and Graduates 13. Existing similar programs at Idaho Public Institutions. Using the chart below, provide enrollments and numbers of graduates for similar existing programs at your institution and other Idaho public institutions . 14. Projections for proposed program: Using the chart below, provide projected enrollments and number of graduates for the proposed program: 15. Describe the methodology for determining enrollment and graduation projections. Refer to information provided in Question #2 \"Need\" above. What is the capacity for the program? Existing Similar Programs: Historical enrollments and graduate numbers Institution and Program Name Headcount Enrollment in Program Number of Graduates From Program recent) BSU BS in Athletic Training (sophomore and above only) 89 85 73 85 13 6 7 13 ISU MS in Athlet ic Training 3 7 7 2 5 (FY16) UI BSPE in Athletic Training MS in Athletic Training Doctor of Athletic Training 46 0 7 19 0 19 3 12 31 2 23 43 4 0 0 10 0 1 2 0 1 1 11 4 Proposed Program: Projected Enrollments and Graduates First Five Years Program Name: Master of Athletic Training Projected Fall Term Headcount Enrollment in Program Projected Annual Number o f Graduates From Program FY19 (first AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 15 Page 12 Describe your recruitment efforts? How did you determine the projected numbers above? The capacity for the program, based on existing personnel and infrastructure, is limited to cohorts of 1 2 and a total enrollment of 24. We are confident that we will easily be able to achieve those numbers, given the historical demand for our bachelor's level program. Although the elevation to a master's level program may result in a reduction in candidate numbers, we believe that we will easily be able to comp ensate with broader recruiting efforts, especially focused on undergraduate students in our kinesiology program . To f acilitate transition to the proposed program, we are developing an acceler ated pathway (3+2 model) to a Master of Athletic Training degree. We project up to 5 underg raduate Boise State students per year would be eligible for such an accelerated plan with the remainder of the cohort filling with traditional graduate degree-seeking students from Boise Sta te and beyond. 16. Minimum Enrollments and Graduates. Have you determined minimums that the program will need to meet in order to be conti nued ? What are those minimums, what is the logical basis for those minimums, what is the time frame, and what is the action that would result? The program will at a minimum be required to exceed the flagging threshold of 5 graduates per year; that threshold was established during Program Prioritization. Resources Required for Implementation - fiscal impact and budget 17. Physical Resources. a. Existing resources . Describe equipment, space, laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other physical equipment presently available to support the successful implementation of the program. Existing instructional resources and equipment will transition to the MAT . b. Impact of new program . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of physical resources by the proposed program? How will the increased use be accommodated? Existing instructional resources and equipment will transition to the MAT. c. Needed resources. List equipment, space, laboratory instruments, etc., that must be obtained to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those physical resources into the budget sheet. Existing instructional resources and equipment will transition to the MAT. A one-time accred itation substantive-change fee of $3000 will be required transition program accreditation to a maste r's degree; that fee will be assessed in 2019. 18. L ibrary resources a. Existing resources and impact of new program . Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 16 Page 13 program? Will there be an impact on existing programs of increased library usage caused by the proposed program? For off-campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. Existing resources are sufficient. b. Needed resources . What new library resources will be required to ensure successful implementation of the program? Enter the costs of those library resources into the budget sheet. Existing resources are sufficient. 19. Personnel resources a. Give an overview of the personnel resources that will be needed to implement the program. How many additional sections of existing courses will be needed? Referring to the list of new courses to be created, what instructional capacity will be needed to offer the necessary number of sections? b. Describe the existing instructional, support, and administrative resources that can be brought to bear to support the successful implementation of the program. c. List the new personnel that must be hired to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those personnel resources into the budget sheet. The bulk of instructional resources needed for the MAT program will be provided by two existing , fully-credentialed faculty members in Athletic Training and ongoing funding for a g raduate assistant, who will transition their teaching duties from the existing bachelor 's program to the new master's program. Additional instructional capacity will be necessary, however, to offer the program. That capacity will be provided as follows: The two existing faculty members will expand their teaching duties to include instruction in summer-session courses. An additional 1.0 FTE faculty member will be added. That additional FTE will enable the d epartment to offer the master's program and to offer the previously mentioned pre - Athletic Training emphasis in the BS Kinesiology degree. a. Impact on existing programs . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of existing personnel resources by the proposed program? How will quality and productivity of existing programs be maintained? As described elsewhere in this proposal, the proposed Master of Athletic Training program wholly replaces the existing BS in Athletic Training program. We anticipate that the discontinuation of the BS Athletic Training program will result in an increase in enrollment in the existing BS in Kinesiology program. 20. Revenue Sources a) Reallocation of funds: If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropriated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 7 Page 17 Page 14 reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? Two faculty members and one graduate assistant who now teach in the bachelor's level program will be assigned to the master's level program. One additional faculty member will be funded using resources reallocated within the College of Health Sciences. Importantly, once the program is fully up and running, it will generate approximately 720 S tudent Credit Hours per year, which will produce tuition revenue that is sufficient to more than justify reallocation of additional FTE from other programs that are less robust. b) Ne w appropriation . If an above Maintenance of Current Operations (MCO) appropriation is required to fund the program, indicate when the institution plans to include the program in the legislative budget request. N/A c) Non-ongoing sources : i. If the funding is to come from one-time sources such as a donation, indicate the sources of other funding. What are the institution's plans for sustaining the program when that funding ends? N/A ii. Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) that will be valid to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? N/A d) Student Fees : i. If the proposed program is intended to levy any institutional local fees, explain how doing so meets the requirements of Board Policy V.R., 3.b. N/A ii. Provide estimated cost to students and total revenue for self-support programs and for professional fees and other fees anticipated to be requested under Board Policy V.R., if applicable. N/A 21. Using the budget template provided by the Office of the State Board of Education, provide the following information: Indicate all resources needed including the planned FTE enrollment, projected revenues, and estimated expenditures for the first four fiscal years of the program. Include reallocation of existing personnel and resources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars. Amounts should reconcile subsequent pages where budget explanations are provided. If the program is contract related, explain the fiscal sources and the year- to-year commitment from the contracting agency(ies) or party(ies). Provide an explanation of the fiscal impact of any proposed discontinuance to include impacts to faculty (i.e., salary savings, re-assignments).

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Boise State University (BSU) proposes to create a new program that will award Master of Science degree in Economics and a Master of Economics degree. The proposed program will be offered face-to-face in BSU's regional service area. Graduates will be prepared for careers that regularly make use of economic concepts and quantitative methods. They will be highly skilled in economic analysis, forecasting, statistical analysis, and political econom y, and will be able to use their skills and knowledge to devel op and shape policy, to inform business decisions, to analyze data, and to manage organizations. Graduates of a master's program in econ omics fall into the category of having \"deep analytical talent.\" The McKinsey Gl obal Institute estima ted that the supply of \"deep analytical talent\" in the U.S. in 2008 was approximately 150,000 positions. They estimate that \"in a big data world, we expect demand for deep analytical talent could reach 440,000 to 490,000 positions in 2018.\" That is a tripling of positions over 10 years. The program is being built on the foundation of a successful Bachelor's degree in the Department of Economics. It will add a set of new graduate-level economics courses, and will thereby strengthen existing graduate busin ess programs such as our MBA and MS in Accountancy. It will also provide coursework for students in graduate programs such as public policy and administr ation, political science, health sciences, geosciences, engineering, and mathematics. The University of Idaho (UI) offers a Ma ster of Science in Applied Economics, which is focused on solving complex i ssues involving agriculture, communities, and natural resources. IMPACT Creation of the proposed pr ogram will have minimal fiscal impact. A portion of the coursework will be provided by ex isting undergraduate economics courses that will be cross-listed as graduate courses. Instructi onal capacity to offer a set of new graduate courses will be provided via reallocation of university funds to create two new graduate teaching assist antships; those assistantships will enable a restructuring of a large undergraduate course, which, in turn, will free up faculty instructional capacit y for the graduate program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 2 ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - MS/Master of Economics program proposal Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS BSU states that students will graduate with a set of co mpetencies that will be highly valuable to government, indus try, and non-governmental organizations: economic analysis, forecasting, statisti cal analysis, and political economy. The MS program will emphasize re search and will require comp letion of a thesis. The Masters program will require completion of a three- credit capstone course and project. The intended audience for the Ma sters is students or others in the community seeking skills in economic and quantitative analysis for career advancement and/or careers in more quantitative and analytical fields. Currently, the University of Idaho offers an MS in Applied Ec onomics, which has a focus in the areas of agriculture and natural resources. The program is designed to prepare students for managemen t, research, and policy positions in the public and private sectors of the economy, and for further graduate study. Neighboring states with similar programs include Utah State University, offering an MS in Applied Economics and an MS/MA in Economics and the University of Oregon, offering an MA/MS in Economics. BSU projects 16 initial enrollments during its first year of implementation, which was determined based on anticipated teachi ng and supervision capacity of up to 15-20 students per cohort given the curr ent number of faculty members and anticipated graduate assi stant resources. BSU's request to create a new Master of Science in Economics and Master of Economics is consistent with their Servic e Region Program Responsibilities and their Five-year Plan for Deli very of Academic Programs in Region III. Consistent with Board Policy III.Z, no inst itution has the st atewide program responsibility for economics programs. The proposal went through the program review process and was recommended for approval by the Council on Academ ic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) on November 17, 2016 and the Board's on Instruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) committee on December 1, 2016. Staff believes sufficient justification ex ists, based on regional need for BSU to create the proposed program, which can be of added va lue to the student and the state in light of BSU's proximity to much of the st ate's governmental structure and economic activity. Board staff recommends approval. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 3 BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Boise State University to create a new academic program that will award a Master of Sci ence in Economics degree and a Master of Economics degree in subst antial conformance to the program proposal submitted as Attachment 1. Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 4 THIS PAGE LEFT INTENTIONALLY BLANK INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 5 Rationale for Creation or Modification of the Program 1. Describe the request and give an overview of the changes that will result. Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Identify any existing program that this program will replace. Boise State University proposes the creation of two new graduate programs with the same core requirements: a Master of Science (M.S.) in Economics and a Master of Economics (M.Ec.). Both pro gr ams provide students with advanced training in current microeconomic theory, quantitative economics, econometrics, and other fields of economics as well as rigorous research methods. The M.S. program will emphasize research and will require completion of a thesis (6 credit s). The intended audience is students or others in the community seeking further education that includes the development of research expertise. The degree will be relevant to a wide range of professions and to those interested in pursuing a Ph.D. in Economics and related fields. The M.Ec. program requires the completion of a three-credit capstone course that includes a project as the culminating activity. The intended audience is students or others in the community seeking skills in economic and quantitative analysis for advan cement in their career, and/or seeking careers in more quantitative and analytical fields. The proposed program will provide substantial value to students and to the State of Idaho. The proposed programs will prepare students for careers that regularly use economic concepts and quantitative methods to analyze and solve real-world problems faced by businesses, government, and society. Graduates will typically obtain jobs as an applied economist or data a nalyst in the public or private sector; or will pursue doctoral studies. Graduate s will be capable of conducting independent analyses, and will be able to use their sk ills and knowledge to develop and shape policy, to inform business decisions, to analy ze da ta, and to manage organizations. The Idaho business community, governmental agencies, and non-governmental organ izations will be provided with local graduates who are highly skilled in economic analysis, forecasting, statistical analysis, and political economy. These graduates will strengthen Idaho's business leadership and increase Idaho's ability to compete nationally and internationally. The programs will add value in a wide range of business, gov ernment, and nonprofit settings, minimizing the need to recruit talent from outside Idaho. The proposed degree programs in economics will not replace any existing programs, but instead will strengthen existing and future graduate and undergraduate programs at Boise State University. Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G., Postsecondary Program Approval and Discontinuance . This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program. All questions must be answered . INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 6 The new programs will strengthen the existing MBA and M.S. in Accountancy programs in the College of Business and Economics by providing diverse graduate-level economics course op portunities to students in those programs. The new programs will provide a set of core classes that can be used as a foundation to launch other speciali zed graduate programs in business, e.g. in Finance. The new programs will provide a set courses that emphasize advanced training in data analysis usin g current statistical methods; those courses will benefit programs in other colleges, e.g. public policy and administration, political science, health sciences, geosciences, engineering, and mathematics. The new program will provide a set of courses that will be of substantial value to those students in our new PhD in Computing who are interested in big data analytics. Two courses in particular, \"Mathematical Statistics and In troduction to Advanced Econometrics\" and \"Advanced Econometrics,\" will provide those students with business-world application of the concepts of big data analytics. See Appendix C for the course d escriptions. The proposed program will provide a \"next step\" for students who graduate from our newly created BS in Business and Economic Analytics. 2. N eed for the Program . Describe the student, regional, and statewide needs that will be addressed by this proposal and address the ways in which the proposed program will meet those needs. Boise State University is located in the capital city of Idaho, a region that is one of the fastest grow ing in the United States. In an increasingly competitive marketplace, graduate education is becoming more valuable - and in some fields, necessary. A survey of undergraduate students in College of Business and Economics identified a h igh demand for a master's program in economics at Boise State, and similar results were found with a survey of alumni and friends in the community. Students are interested in the advantage that advanced training can bring to them in the local wor kplace. Many of these students are not willing to leave the Treasure Valley to pursue g raduate work, which means that the proposed graduate degrees will prepare many individuals planning to work locally or regionally. a. Workforce need: Provide verification of state workforce needs that will be met by this program. Include State and National Department of Labor research on employment potential. Using the chart below, indicate the total projected annual job openings (including growth and replacement demands in your regional area, the state, and nation. Job openings should represent positions which require graduation from a program such as the one proposed. Data should be derived from a source that can be validated and must be no more than two years old. Provide (as appropriate) additional narrative as to the workforce needs that will be met by the proposed program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 7The following table compiles information on workforce need.

The McKinsey Global Institute estimated that the supply of \"deep analytical talent \" in the U.S. in 2008 was approximately 150,000 positions. They estimate t hat \"in a big data world, we expect demand for deep analytical talent could reach 440,000 to 490,000 positions in 2018.\" Therefore, we estimate a growth of 290,000 to 340,000 over that 10-year period, or 29,000 - 34,000 annual growth. We estimate the demand in Idaho as 0.5 % of the annual U.S. number in \"deep analytical talent,\" based on population size, and the local region as being half of the state number. b. Student need. What is the most likely source of students who will be expected to enroll (full-time, part-time, outreach, etc.). Document student demand by providing information you have about student interest in the proposed program from inside and outside the institution. If a survey was used, please attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix A. We have documented demand among our students for a graduate program in economics at Boise State . In surveys to current upper level College of Business and Economics students, 92 out of 28 7 (33%) indicated that they would be interested in applying for the proposed graduate pr ograms in economics . Of upper division economics students only, 73% (47 out of 64) are inter ested. Based upon a survey administered through LinkedIn , 68% ( 21 out of 31) of alumni or friends in community indicate an interest in applying to the master's program in economics . In addition, we occasionally receive inquiries from local community members with interests in a master's program with a focus on quantitative analysis and economics. The number one reason for an interest in pursuing the graduate degree in economics at Boise State according to our survey is \"an advanced degree to help with the job market,\" followed by \"a step towards earning a Ph .D.,\" and \"an interest in studying economics further.\" All groups surveyed overwhelmingly indicated that the top field/focus of interest in a graduate program in economics is \"quantitative analysis /statistics/econometrics/data analytics,\" which is comp lementary to our goal to build expertise and increase focus in business and economic analytics both at the undergraduate and graduate level. c. Economic Need : Describe how the proposed program will act to stimulate the state economy by advancing the field, providing research results, etc. This program will provide the Idaho business community, and government entities, with local graduates highly skilled in economic analysis, forecasting, statistical analysis, and political economy. These graduates will strengthen Idaho's business leadership and increase Idaho's ability to compete nationally and internationally. The proposed programs will add value in a wide ran ge of business, government, and nonprofit settings, minimizing the need to recruit INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 9talent from outside Idaho. As was noted above, the McKinsey Global Institute1 estimated that the supply of \"deep analytical talent\" in the U .S. in 2008 was approximately 150,000 position , and that \"in a big data world, we expect demand for deep analytical talent could reach 440,000 to 490,000 positions in 2018.\" The proposed program will provide graduates with \"deep analytical talent.\" d.

Justification for Duplication with another institution listed above. (if applicable). If the proposed program is similar to another program offered by an Idaho public institution, provide a rationale as to why any resulting duplication is a net benefit to the state and its citizens. Describe why it is not feasible for existing programs at other institutions to fulfill the need for the proposed program. The proposed programs are not similar to programs offered by any Idaho public institution. The Un iversity of Idaho offers an MS in Applied Economics, but that degree is focused on \"complex issues involving agriculture, communities and natural resources,\" whereas the programs that will be offered at Boise State will be much more broad in its focus. 5. Describe how this request supports the institution's vision and/or strategic plan. The following bolded passages show the relevance of the program to Boise State University's Mission: Boise State University is a public, metropolitan, research university offering an array of undergraduate and graduate degrees and experiences that foster student success, lifelong learning, community engagement, innovation and creativity .

Additional requirements. Describe additional requirements such as comprehensive examination, senior thesis or other capstone experience, practicum, or internship, some of which may carry credit hours included in the list above. The Master of Economics program will require the completion of a three credit Capstone cour se as the culminating activity. It provides students with advanced training in current microeconomic theory , quantitative economics, econometrics, and other fields of economics, as well as rigorous research methods. The MS in Economics will require a thesis as the culminating activity. The research leading up to the thesi s will give students the ability to produce an article of publishable quality. This will significantly advance their research skills and provide students with skills to complete complex analyses in economics. 11. Program Intended Learning Outcomes and Connection to Curriculum. a. Intended Learning Outcomes. List the Intended Learning Outcomes for the proposed program, using learner-centered statements that indicate what will students know, be able to do, and value or appreciate as a result of completing the program. Both the M.S. and M.Ec. programs will provide students with advanced training in current microeconomic theory , quantitative economics, econometrics, and other fields of economics, as well as rigorous research methods. The Pr ogram Intended Learning Outcomes (PILO) are as follows: (A) Quan titative Reasoning Skills: At the completion of the program, students are expected to: 1) understand how to use empirical evidence to evaluate the validity of an economic argument, 2) use econometric methodology, interpret results of econometric models and conduct appr opriate statistical analysis of data to answer a research question, 3) solve economic models mathematically and provide intuitive explanations of the results (B) Specialized Knowledge and Application of Skills: At the completion of the program, students are expected to : INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 131) develop a sophisticated understanding of the theoretical, analytical, and methodological approaches used within the discipline of microeconomics and related field s, 2) carry out economic and policy analyses that draw on microeconomic theory, 3) apply economic analysis to everyday problems in real world situations, to understand current events and evaluate specific policy proposals (C) Research Skills: At the completion of the program, students are expected to: 1) for mulate researchable economics questions in an independent manner, 2) develop resea rch projects and contribute to research activities of a team, 3) locate and evaluate relevant sources for a research project in a critical manner, 4) develop research projects through which they are abl e to use complex statistical techniques to analyze a wide-range of outcomes, 5) be committed to the ethical conduct of research and professional activities (D) Communication Skills: At the completion of the program, students are expected to : 1) com municate effectively in written, oral and graphical form about specific issues and to fo rmulate well-organized written arguments that state assumptions and hypotheses supported by evidence, 2) disseminate research results in a clear and coherent manner to other researchers, employers, coworkers, and to the general public, 3) contribute to the intellectual community and be able to critically analyze and evaluate one's own, as well as others' findings and give effective and constructive feed back to others. 12. Assessment plans a. Assessment Process. Describe the assessment process that will be used to evaluate how well students are achieving the intended learning outcomes of the program. The assignments embedded in the programs ' courses that can be evaluated for student learning will be identified for each PILO. For example, the assignments and written exams in Cour se ECON 522 Advanced Econometrics will be evaluated by the instructor using a rubric desig ned to evaluate student mastery of PILO #A.2: (quantitative reasoning skills): \" The studen t will use econometric methodology, interpret results of econometric models, and conduct appropriate statistical analysis of data to answer a research question. \" Instructors of courses with these types of embedded assignments and written exams will aggregate the data and submit a report on the student learning to the program curriculum and assessment committee. In addition to periodic assignments, written exams, and paper projects, there will be two dist inct culminating experiences in the proposed master's programs in economics. These will allow g raduates to demonstrate their mastery of a significant literature in economics and state- of-the-art analytical techniques. Thesis: The thesis option is required for MS Economics program. Examination of INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 14theses will enable the department to evaluate (i) research skills and (ii) skills necessary to complete complex analyses in economics. Capstone Project: The students pursuing master of economics will work on a culmin ating activity/project. Examination of theses will provide faculty with infor mation on the research skills of students and their ability to solve complex problems . Thesis advisers and instructors who oversee capstone projects will evaluate student mastery and performance, and submit a report on the student learning outcomes and culmination project/thesis outcomes to the program curriculum and assessment committee. b. Cl osing the loop. How will you ensure that the assessment findings will be used to improve the program? Annually, the curriculum and assessment committee will review the submitted findings regard ing PILOs and will also review the results of the most recent graduating student survey. A retr eat will be held with all faculty involved in the program, and will be used to identify strengths and areas for improvement. We plan to focus on a specific PILO and the course(s) that ad dresses that PILO every year in more detail during the retreat , effectively evaluating every PILO very carefully every four years. c. Mea sures used. What direct and indirect measures will be used to assess student learning? We plan to use primarily direct measures by identifying assignments embedded in program courses. We will also have a graduating student survey that will serve as an indirect measure. d. T iming and frequency . When will assessment activities occur and at what frequency? Assessment results will be collected in key courses to assess student learning of each outcome. The faculty will meet to review results annually as described above. Enrollments and Graduates 13. Existing similar programs at Idaho Public Institutions.

Projections for proposed program: Using the chart below, provide projected enrollments and number of graduates for the proposed program: 15. Describe the methodology for determining enrollment and graduation projections. Refer to information provided in Question #2 \"Need\" above. What is the capacity for the program? Describe your recruitment efforts. How did you determine the projected numbers above? The projected enrollments were based on: 1) anticipated teaching and supervision capacity of up to 15 - 20 students per cohort given the current number of faculty members and anticipated gr aduate assistant resources; and 2) sufficient anticipated demand based on survey results and inquiry calls from local professionals. The projected annual number of graduates is based on 1) antici pated number of students in the accelerated program, students likely enrolled as full- time and students likely to enroll as part-time; and 2) anticipated annual attrition rate of 10 percent for full-time and accelerated students and 20 percent for part-time students. Our initial recruitment efforts will primarily be focused on current and former students in th e Treasure Valley. We will recruit seniors from Boise State University, the College of Idaho, and Northwest Nazarene University. We will also recruit in the industry as well as non-profit and public sectors. Following the first recruitment phase, we will expand recruitment across Idaho and the Intermountain West. 16. Minimum Enrollments and Graduates. Have you determined minimums that the program will need to meet in order to be continued? What are those minimums, what is the logical basis for those minimums, what is the time frame, and what is the action that would result? Creation of the proposed program will require the investment by central administration of $48,622 of ongoing funds for two graduate assistantships (includes stipend, tuition, and fees) UI: MS in Applied Economics 14 11 9 9 7 9 4 4 LCSC Proposed Program: Projected Enrollments and Graduates First Five Years Program Name: MS in Economics and Master in Economics (M.Ec.)

Additionally, the prog ram will require investment by the College of Business and Economics of $10,000 of one-time funding, $23,936 of ongoing funding for a graduate assistantship, and $3,000 of ongoing funds for communication and marketing. Continuation of the central investment and investment by the College of Business and Economics will require that the program produce in excess of the total ongoing cost ($71,859 using FY17 costs). At the FY17 rates of $199.52 tuition an d $85 graduate fee per credit, the program will be required to produce 253 student credit hours per year. That number is equivalent to an enrollment of 14 students, each taking 18 cred its per year. If the program does not consistently meet that performance target, funding will be withdrawn. Resources Required for Implementation - fiscal impact and budget 17. Physical Resources. a. Existing resources . Describe equipment, space, laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other physical equipment presently available to support the successful implementation of the program. Existing classroom space, including computer classrooms, will be sufficient to support the program. b. Impact of new program . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of physical resources by the proposed program? How will the increased use be accommodated? Classes for program can easily be accommodated by existing facilities. c. Needed resources. List equipment, space, laboratory instruments, etc., that must be obtained to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those physical resources into the budget sheet. No additional physical resources are required. 18. Library resources a. Existing resources and impact of new program . Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present program? Will there be an impact on existing programs of increased library usage caused by the proposed program? For off-campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. The Albertsons library currently offers a well-rounded selection of periodicals and database sources a cross multiple fields within the discipline of economics (e.g., Econometrics, Health Economics , Natural Resources and Environmental Economics , Economics of Sustainability). The dep artment will continue to work with the library liaison to review resources and suggest additions, changes and offer fiscal support for those changes as resources allow. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 17 There should be no impact on the existing programs of increased library usage caused by the proposed program since most access will be electronically accessed. There will be no off-campus programs. b. Needed resources . What new library resources will be required to ensure successful implementation of the program? Enter the costs of those library resources into the budget sheet. No additional library resources are needed. 19. Personnel resources a. Give an overview of the personnel resources that will be needed to implement the program. How many additional sections of existing courses will be needed? Referring to the list of new courses to be created, what instructional capacity will be needed to offer the necessary number of sections? b. Describe the existing instructional, support, and administrative resources that can be brought to bear to support the successful implementation of the program. c. List the new personnel that must be hired to support the proposed program. Enter the costs of those personnel resources into the budget sheet. (Please note: we are addressing the three questions regarding personnel resources in one section, and then addressing impact on existing programs below.) Most of the graduate coursework to be taken by students in the program will be existing undergr aduate courses that will be cross-listed as graduate-level courses. Graduate students in those courses will be required to complete additional work to earn graduate-level credit. The existing und ergraduate courses have capacity for additional students, and the addition of graduate students to the existing sections will be a no-cost way to increase productivity of those courses. We will also offer new graduate coursework that is not cross -listed with undergraduate courses. 1. We will offer two new graduate core courses, one 3-credit and one 4-credit, each of the fall and spring semesters. 2. We will offer one new graduate core 2-credit course during summer. 3. We will offer thesis credits and project credits as necessary. To crea te the additional capacity necessary to offer the new graduate core courses, we will do the following: 1. We will create three new graduate assistantships. One will be created via a reallocation from the Col lege of Business and Economics of an existing assistantship. Two will be created using an investment of appropriated funds from the central administration. 2. Those three graduate assistantships will be used to enable us to increase the section size in ECON 303 Intermediate Microeconomics the existing 30 - 40 section size to larger sections of 50 - 60 students. The increase in section size will enable us to offer INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 18two fewer sections per semester, and the teaching capacity from those two sections will be used to teach the 2-per-semester graduate core courses during fall and spring. 3. The graduate core course taught during summer will be taught by a faculty member who will be funded by our typical summer session protocol. 4. Thesis and project credits will be taken on by faculty members in addition to their existing teaching load. Importantly, by doing so, those faculty members actually increase their research productivity, also an important part of their overall workload responsibility. In addition to the need for increased instructional capacity, we will fund a graduate coordinator position at $5,000 per year. d. I mpact on existing programs . What will be the impact on existing programs of increased use of existing personnel resources by the proposed program? How will quality and productivity of existing programs be maintained? We do not anticipate any changes in our course availability and variety of course offerings in our undergraduate programs. W e believe that the creation of the graduate programs will actually increase the quality and interest in our undergraduate programs by providing a grea ter variety of upper division courses , by creating additional opportunities to participate in research, and by offering undergraduate students an accelerated 4+1 option to receive an undergr aduate and graduate degree in economics. To be able to increase overall instructional capacity, we will increase the section size of ECON 303 Intermediate Microeconomics to 50 - 60 students instead of 30 - 40 as currently being of fered . To ensure that quality remains high in those larger sections, we will (i) adjust the ped agogy under the guidance of our Center for Teaching and Learning and (ii) make use of graduate teaching assistants in ECON 303 to provide additional instructor-student opportuni ties. 20. Revenue Sources a) Reallocation of funds: If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropriated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? Funding for one graduate assistantship will be reallocated from an existing graduate assistantship presently housed in the College of Business and Economics. That graduate assist antship is now allocated to departments on an \"as needed\" basis, and the reallocation to the proposed program simply represents a permanent allocation to the Department of Economics. Funding for two new graduate assistantships will be reallocated from existing appropriated funds of the central administration. This reallocation represents an investment that is likely to pay off in increased tuition revenue from students who would not have otherwise attended Boise State University. As noted in Section 16 above, if enrollments in the program do not produce sufficient revenue to cover the reallocation, the central resources will be withdrawn. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 8 Page 19b) New appropriation . If an above Maintenance of Current Operations (MCO) appropriation is required to fund the program, indicate when the institution plans to include the program in the legislative budget request. N/A c) Non-ongoing sources : i. If the funding is to come from one-time sources such as a donation, indicate the sources of other funding. What are the institution's plans for sustaining the program when that funding ends? N/A ii. Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) that will be valid to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? N/A d) Student Fees : i. If the proposed program is intended to levy any institutional local fees, explain how doing so meets the requirements of Board Policy V.R., 3.b. N/A ii. Provide estimated cost to students and total revenue for self-support programs and for professional fees and other fees anticipated to be requested under Board Policy V.R., if applicable. N/A e) Other The Department of Economics will provide a fellowship of $10,000 to each of two students enrolled in the proposed program using funds resulting from the John J. and Ethel Chapman endowment. 21. Using the budget template provided by the Office of the State Board of Education, provide the following information: Indicate all resources needed including the planned FTE enrollment, projected revenues, and estimated expenditures for the first four fiscal years of the program. Include reallocation of existing personnel and resources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars. Amounts should reconcile subsequent pages where budget explanations are provided. If the program is contract related, explain the fiscal sources and the year- to-year commitment from the contracting agency(ies) or party(ies). Provide an explanation of the fiscal impact of any proposed discontinuance to include impacts to faculty (i.e., salary savings, re-assignments).

This program is a blend of the existing Master of Arts in Secondary Education degree and the Certification Only tr ack. Both programs will continue to exist alongside the MAT. This degree will target a demonstrated need in the State of Idaho for qualified personnel in the secondary school setting. MAT programs ensure deep content knowle dge grounded in a bachelor's degree, and then provide master-level pedagogy and research skills that prepare teachers for initial licensure while focu sing on the analysis of student data and implementation of best practices that support student achievement. The program will be a cohort m odel with a timeline for completion based upon six (6) consecutive semesters, Summer semester through Sp ring semester. The program will be offered entirely online to serve interested parties throughout the state and provide greater acce ss to our rural communities. Program objectives are to increase optio ns in pathways to teaching for content experts and career-changers who already ho ld a bachelor's degree, to create an educator preparation program that provides an incentive to seek teacher certification by promising higher star ting salaries due to the simultaneous completion of a master's degree and to maximize enrollment in existing College of Education courses scheduled in the regular course rotation. IMPACT The MAT will not require any additional funding or new c ourses but will consist of a redistribution of existing courses to pr ovide graduates with a bachelor's degree in a specific content ar ea the pedagogical knowledge and skills necessary for initial certification as a t eacher in Idaho. ISU does not anticipate that the MAT will negatively impact the current Master of Education (M.Ed .) in Secondary Education degree. The M.Ed. in Secondary Education focuses on fully-certified teachers seeking deeper pedagogy and content kno wledge. The population targeted for the MAT program will be persons with an exis ting bachelor's degree who are seeking initia l certification. There could be an impact on the Certification Only programs as students elect to pursue a master's degree and ce rtification rather than just certification. There would be no appreciable loss in overall enrollment and tuition, as equivalent INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 2 graduate credit coursework would r eplace undergraduate coursework and ultimately result in official, recorded program completer gains for the college. Graduate courses in the current rota tion would also be maximized. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Master of Arts in Teac hing proposal Page 3 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ISU projects approximately 12- 20 initial enrollments at the start of the program. Upon implementation, cohor t enrollment will be capped at 20 candidates. ISU's request to create a new Master of Ar ts in Teaching is consistent with their Service Region Program Responsibilities and their Five-year Plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in Region III. Cons istent with Board Policy III.Z, no institution has the state wide program responsibility for educator preparation programs. The proposal went through the program review process and was recommended for approval by the Council on Academ ic Affairs and Programs (CAAP) on November 17, 2016 and to the Board's Instruction, Re search, and Student Affairs (IRSA) committee on December 1, 2016. Board staff recommends approval. BOARD ACTION I move to approve the request by Idaho Stat e University to approve the Master's in Social Work in substantial conform ance to the program pr oposal submitted as Attachment 1. Moved by __________ Seconded by _____ _____ Carried Yes _____ No _____ INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 3Before completing this form, refer to Board Policy Section III.G., Program Approval and Discontinuance . This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program and each program discontinuation. All questions must be answered. 1. Describe the nature of the request. Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Please identify any existing program, option that this program will replace. If this is request to discontinue an existing program, provide the rationale for the discontinuance. Indicate the year and semester in which the last cohort of students was admitted and the final term the college will offer the program. Describe the teach- out plans for continuing students. The College of Education is requesting the addition of a Master of Arts in Teaching Program (MAT). This program is a blend of the existing Master of Arts in Secondary Education degree and the Certification Only track. Both programs will continue to exist alongside the MAT. This degree will target a demonstrated need in the State of Idaho for qualified personnel in the secondary school setting. Programs like this exist across the country to accommodate those holding Bachelor degrees in relevant content areas to train them in pedagogy and research skills resulting in deeply prepar ed, highly qualified secondary teachers. In states such as Oregon and California, this is the only option for attaining init ial teacher certification. MAT programs ensure deep content knowledge grounded in a Bachelor degree, and then provide Masters- level pedagogy and research skills that prepare teachers for initial licensure while focusing on the analysis of student data and implementation of best practices that support student achievement. An advantage of preparing candidates within a Master program is that they will be able to qualify for both students loans and the TEACH grant. Candidates already holding a Bachelor degree and seeking certification only are not eligible for these benefits. The program will be a cohort model with a timeline for complet ion based upon six (6) consecutive semesters, Summer through Spring. Program will be offered entirely online to serve interested parties throughout the state. 2. List the objectives of the program. The objectives should address specific needs the program will meet. They should also identify and the expected student learning outcomes and achievements. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Program objectives are as follows: To increase options in pathways to teaching for content experts and career -changers who already hold a Bachelor degree. To create an educator preparation program that provides an incentive to seek teacher certification by promising higher starting salaries due to the simultaneous completion of a Master degree. To maximize enrollment in existing College of Education courses scheduled in the INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 4regular course rotation. Expected student learning outcomes are clearly defined in the Idaho Standards for Initial Certification of Professional School Personnel which are incorporated into State Board Rule by reference. All teacher candidates will meet the requirements defined in State Board Rule (08.02.02: Rules Governing Uniformity). The MAT program will pr ovide candidates with an advanced level of pedagogical knowledge to effectively manage P- 12 classrooms, motivate classrooms of diverse learners, plan instruction and appropriate assessments for classrooms of diverse learners, and develop instructional strategies that address the learning needs of diverse learners. 3. Briefly describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program (i.e., program review). Will the program require specialized accreditation (it is not necessary to address regional accreditation)? If so, please identify the agency and explain why you do or do not plan to seek accreditation. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Initial review of the MAT program proposal will be conducted by the Standards Committee of the Professional Standards Commission (PSC) . Upon conditional approval, a full review of the program will be conducted just prior to the graduation of the first cohort of degree -completers. A PSC team is currently scheduled to review programs in Spring 2018, and then on a regularly scheduled rotation. Over time, program reviews will be conducted by the Idaho Professional Standards Commission as well as the national Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP) to ensure a quality program and maintenance of performance standards. A CAEP program review will be conducted in conjunction with the PSC in Spring 2022 and a gain on a seven (7) year rotation. In the interim, annual reports on program status and evidence of continuous improvement measures will be submitted to CAEP. 4. List new courses that will be added to your curriculum specific for this program. Indicat e number, title, and credit hour value for each course. Please include course descriptions for new and/or changes to courses. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. This program will require no new courses but will consist of a redistribution of existing courses to provide graduates with a Bachelor degree in a specific content area the pedagogical knowledge and skills necessary for initial certification as a teacher in Idaho. 5. Please provide the program completion requirements to include the following and attach a typical curriculum to this proposal as Appendix A. For discontinuation requests, will courses continue to be taught? INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 5Credit hours required: 34 Credit hours required in support courses: 0 Credit hours in required electives: 0 Credit hours for thesis or dissertation: 0 Total credit hours required for completion: 34 The expected sequence of coursework and descriptions of each course, as well as admission requirements, are attached as Appendix A -1 and Appendix A- 2. 6. Describe additional requirements such as preliminary qualifying examination, comprehensive examination, thesis, dissertation, practicum or internship, some of which may carry credit hours included in the list above. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Candidates in the Master of Arts in Teaching will be required to have a Bachelor degree in a relevant content area and will undergo admission screening based upon requisite dispositions and a desire to teach high school students. Candidates must also pass the appropriate Praxis II examination required by the State of Idaho to provide evidence of content competency. Candidates will also be required to complete a three -credit clinical placement seminar series in addition to a minimum of 600 contact hours with secondary students (6 -12). The clinical placement will include an action research project related to the candidate's work with students in the secondary clinical setting. Candidates will be required to present their action research project and relate d findings during a one- credit capstone experience. The capstone experience will be judged by a panel of three faculty, including a Representative of the ISU Graduate Faculty (GFR). 7. Identify similar programs offered within Idaho or in the region by other colleges/universities. If the proposed request is similar to another state program, provide a rationale for the duplication.

Describe the methodology for determining enrollment projections. If a survey of student interest was conducted, attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix B . This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Enrollment projections are based upon two primary reports; the Idaho State Department of Education's Authorizations Report that tracks the number of people currently holding a Bachelor degree and seeking immediate Alternative Authorization to serve as \"teacher of record\" in Idaho public schools. The most current report (2013- 14) indicates a statewide pool of 134 people with a Bachelor degree seeking initial certification. This report is attached as Appendix B- 1. The second source is a Record of Inquiries (Appendix B -2) maintained by the Advising Office in the College of Education. This report, which catalogs inquiries about teacher certification by those holding Bachelor's degrees. From January 2015 to December 2015, 144 inquiries were made. Of these, 8 enrolled in the College of Education's Certification Only program starting summer 2015. Enrollment for the Summer 2016 cert -only cohort has not yet been determined. Most of those who inquire about our programs are interested in an advanced degree in addition to the initial certification , with online availability. The addition of this MAT program will address both areas ; meeting the needs of working individuals seeking initial certific ation and of the advanc ement of their education. Additionally, approximately 500 Idaho candidates are reportedly enrolled in the American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence (ABCTE) program. This represents a nother large pool of candidates ho lding a Bachelor degree who are interested in getting teacher certification. Enrollment and Graduates. Using the chart below, p rovide a realistic estimate of enrollment at the time of program implementation and over three year period based on availability of students meeting the criteria referenced above. Include part -time and full -time (i.e., number of majors or other relevant data) by institution for the proposed program, last three years beginning with the current year and the previous two years. Also, indicate the projected number of graduates and graduation rates. Discontinuations. Using the chart below include part -time and full -time (i.e., number of majors or other relevant data) by institution for the proposed discontinuation, last thre e years beginning with the current year and previous two years. Indicate how many students are currently enrolled in the program for the previous two years, to include number of graduates and graduation rates.

Title II Higher Education Opportunity Act (HEOA ) reports are not available beyond 2012- 13, and ISU has just begun tracking certification only candidates. Upon implementation, cohort enrollment will be capped at 20 candidates . This limit is based upon the current program capacity that exists between the Master of Education in Secondary Education and Certification Only route that will allow us to fill current course offerings to capacity without incurring any new expenses. 9. Will this program reduce enrollments in other programs at your institution? If so, please explain. We do not anticipate that the MAT will negatively impact the current Master of Education in Secondary Education degree. The M.Ed. in Secondary Education focuses on fully -certified teachers seeking deeper pedagogy and content knowledge. The population targeted for the MAT program will be persons with an existing Bachelor degree who are seeking initial certification. There could be an impact on the Certification Only programs as students elect to pursue a Master degree and certification rather than just certification. There would be no appreciable loss in overall enrollment and tuition, as equivalent graduate credit coursework would replace undergraduate coursework and ultimately result in official, recorded program completer gains for the college. Graduate courses in the current rotation would also be maximized. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 910. Provide verification of state workforce needs such as job titles requiring this degree. Include State and National Department of Labor research on employment potential. Using the chart below, indicate the total projected job openings (including growth and replacement demands in your regional area, the state, and nation.

Will any type of distance education technology be utilized in the delivery of the program on your main campus or to remote sites? Please describe. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. This program will be delivered using online delivery formats, both synchronous and asynchronous. Courses will be developed and shared using the ISU instructional management system (Moodle2) and related resources within Moodle2 (Collaborate, etc.). 12. Describe how this request is consistent with the State Board of Education's strategic plan and institution's role and mission. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. The implementation of a Master of Arts in Teaching program addresses many of the goals and objectives of the Idaho State Board of Education's strategic plan, but most specifically: GOAL 3: Effective and Efficient Educational System - Ensure educational resources are coordinated throughout the state and used effectively. Objective B: Quality Teaching Workforce - Develop, recruit, and retain a diverse and highly qualified workforce of teachers, faculty, and staff. The implementation of a Master of Arts in Teaching program relates to Idaho State University's mission to contribute to the preparation of teachers, especially within Regions 4, 5, and 6. The proposed program also fits with ISU's core theme four: Community Engagement and Impact. Through its outreach campuses and centers, the MAT will become an integral component of the local communities, the State of Idaho and the Inter -mountain region; benefiting K -12 schools by producing high quality teacher -researchers. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 11 13. Describe how this request fits with the institution's vision and/or strategic plan. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Goals of Institution Strategic Mission Proposed Program Plans to Achieve the Goal GOAL 5: Focus institutional instructional and research expertise on community and societal needs throughout the state, region, nation, and world. Objective 5.2: Strengthen partnerships /collaboration with K- 12 organizations to enhance students' abilities to enter and ascend ISU's educational ladder of opportunity. The MAT program will strengthen partnerships with K -12 sc hools by recruiting qualified candidates from within regional schools and outside of school districts. Unlike any other teacher preparation program in the state, the MAT will prepare a variety of secondary teachers who will conduct action research as par t of the program requirements. This research will be directly related to student performance within Idaho school districts, and will contribute to the body of knowledge on best practices. 14. Is the proposed program in your institution's Five- Year plan? Indicate below. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Yes X No If not on your institution's Five- Year plan, provide a justification for adding the program. 15. Explain how students are going to learn about this program and where students are going to be recruited from (i.e., within institution, out -of-state, internationally). For requests to discontinue a program, how will continuing students be advised of impending changes and consulted about options or alternatives for attaining their educational goals? ISU undergraduate majors will be recruited along with graduates from other regional undergraduate programs (including BYU I). Additionally, to fill the need to fully qualify professionals for employment in the secondary school setting, we will recruit individuals who possess a Bachelor degree that are currently working in schools as paraprofessionals, support service staff, or on provisional certification. We will also recruit career -changers, like those seeking ABCTE certification, from across Idaho. However, our primary intent is to recruit and retain the best possible candidates to ensure the quality of our program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 12 Recruiting strategies to be employed will include: Program Website Recruiting Brochures Formal affiliations with area Colleges, Universities, and K -12 School Districts Possible booth/recruiting materials at education-related conferences in Idaho Recruiting from within ISU, as well as other colleges and universities in Idaho Graduate Catalog 16.

Program begins INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 17Advisement The COE advisor works closely with the student to assist them in scheduling and verifying MAT program requirements. Ultimately however, it is the student's responsibility to be sure that all MAT program requirements are met. Restricted Registration Any graduate student receiving a C+ or below in one graduate courses during her or his MAT program, whose GPA falls below 3.0, or who does not have an approved planned program of study may be automatically blocked from registering for additional courses. The student may petition through the COE Advisor to have this block removed. Classification of Graduate Students Classified Status may be granted to graduates of accredited institutions who hav e earned the following: GPA STANDARDIZED TEST 3.5 TO 4.000 No standardized test (GRE/MAT) required 3.0 to 3.499 Minimum: 40 th Percentile on at least one area of the GRE or 40 th Percentile on the MAT 2.5 to 2.999 Minimum: Combined Verbal and Quantitative (V + Q) score of 1000 on GRE or 45 th Percentile on the MAT Below 2.499 No Admission Unclassified Status may be granted, on exception by faculty vote, to applicants holding a bachelor's degree who desire to take courses for graduate credit for personal or professional enrichment, but who do not want to pursue a graduate degree. There is no assurance that courses taken under unclassified status may be used later to satisfy degree requirements. Students may not take more than 9 credits without applying for classified status and must petition to transfer a maximum of 30% of credits from unclassified status to a degree program. Grading A 3.0 GPA is required for any graduate degree or certification at Idaho State University. A grade of C+ or below is essentially failing at the graduate level. Any graduate student receiving a grade of C+ or below in one graduate courses during his or her program, or whose GPA falls below 3.0 will be automatically blocked from registering for additional courses. The student may petition through the COE Advisor to have this block removed. Semester Credit Limits The maximum number of credits obtainable in a semester is 16, including courses taken at the undergraduate level. In a summer semester, a student may earn a number of credits equal to the number of weeks enrolled plus two, and the total number of summer semester credits may not exceed 12 (e.g., a student taking classes for eight weeks may earn up to 10 credits). Exceptions must be approved by the EPP Chair , and communicated to the Graduate Dean. Graduate Assistants may register for no more than 12 credits per semester. Transfer Credits All graduate credits must be earned as Idaho State University resident credits except for the following: In all degree programs a total of nine semester credits may be transferred from an accredited institution. Transfer of residence credits from an accredited institution is acceptable only if the courses are specifically approved by the advisor on the planned program of study, and by the Graduate School Office INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 9 Page 18AND the academic department of ISU when the final program of study is submitted. Official transcripts to be used for transfer of credits in a degree program must be IN the Graduate School office, with t he Transcript Evaluator, before the final program of study and the application for a degree will be approved. Additionally, the final official transcript must be sent to ISU Graduate School for any credits earned outside of ISU before the degree will be po sted. Graduate Standardized Test An Idaho State University requirement for all graduate degree programs is the satisfactory completion of the GRE or MAT exam. The EPP requires all applicants to complete a Graduate Standardized Test with the exception of students with a GPA of 3.5 or better, based on the last 60\u00b1 semester undergraduate credits (see page 1, Classification of Graduate Students). Capstone Project All students seeking a MAT degree must complete a capstone project. This project may start no earlier than the final semester of coursework and must be completed within one calendar year. Topic approval must be gained from a faculty advisor and the EPP Chair . Students are encouraged to work closely with their advisor to complete this requirement. Form and style MUST meet acceptable formal writing procedures as detailed in the PUBLICATION MANUAL OF THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION (APA) 6th Edition. A manual for preparing thesis and dissertation work is available from the Office of Graduate S tudies. The MAT student is responsible for organizing a three-member committee and obtaining the GFR. The student is responsible for coordinating and scheduling all committee meetings. A proposal meeting with all examining committee members is required before the capstone project can begin. All committee members are to receive a summary of the capstone project proposal a minimum of two weeks prior to the proposal meeting. Final written papers of the project should be distributed to all examining commit tee members a minimum of four weeks before the scheduled defense (must be at least five weeks prior to graduation). If any member questions whether or not the substance or form of the project is adequate, the committee as a whole decides if the project is sufficiently prepared for final oral defense. The major advisor is responsible for reporting a final grade to the registrar for all prior project registrations of the candidate when the oral defense has been successful and when the finished project has be en approved by the examining committee .

BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION Idaho State University is currently approv ed to offer a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Social Work and is now proposi ng to add a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. Currently, the BA progr am prepares graduates for generalist professional practice. A new MSW program would prepare graduates for advanced professional practice in an area of concentra tion within the field of social work through mastery of a core se t of competencies as set forth by the Council on Social Work Education (CSW E), the national accrediting body. Two options for the MSW degree would be offer ed: 1) a one-year, advanced standing MSW program which would be an effici ent graduate education option for those students who complete their BA degrees in social work at ISU or another CSWE accredited program; 2) a traditional tw o-year program fo r students who have completed non-social work BA degrees. Given the current state of the pr ofession for employment opportunities, Southeast Idaho (Regions 5 and 6) community need, and ISU student need, an MSW program at ISU is necessary. Local (regional) job openings are expected to be over 70 per year for the next th ree years. Economic data and forecasts indicate that social work related jobs are likely to be one of the top areas of growth in Idaho well into the next decade. Social work job openings are growing at a local, state, and national rate that significantly exceeds other job opportunities. Our purpose is to develop a quality, primarily seated, MSW program. Boise State University offers its MSW program both on campus and fully online. BSU has primary statewide responsibility for So cial Work programs with a shared responsibility with ISU for programs in Region 5 and 6. Given Southeast Idaho's student base of firs t generation students a nd face-to-face learning styles, a fully online program offered to Idaho students will not adequately meet student learning needs within the State or the need for qualified professionals within our profession and community. We are proposing an option for students which will be bas ed on quality, face-to-face interactions with intense faculty supervision and contact. IMPACT The enrollment in other pr ograms at ISU will not be impacted. Students who earn a BA in Social Work from ISU typically go on to gain their masters from another INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH, AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 2 institution which creates hardship in te rms of expense and travel. With a local program, students will be able to concentra te their time on study and remain engaged in the local community while ear ning their degree. An MSW program at ISU would offer BA level students an alternat ive to traveling or enrolling in an online program to earn their graduate degrees. ISU proposes to charge a professiona l fee consistent with Board Policy V.R.3.b.iv. at $200 per seme ster. Total credit hours for completion of the program are 60 graduate credits for the tradit ional two-year program and 45 graduate credits (including 12 field credits) for the advanced standing program. Student fees are necessary to cover specialized accreditation fees and costs associated with the field practicum. ATTACHMENTS Attachment 1 - Proposal for the Master in Social Work Page 5 STAFF COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ISU projects 25 initial enro llments at the start of t he program with 25 additional enrollments in year two and another in y ear three, after which enrollment would stabilize at approxim ately 75 students. ISU requests approval to assess a professi onal fee consistent with Board Policy V.R.3.b.iv. at $200 per semester. This policy provides t he criteria that must be met in order to designate a professi onal fee for a Board approved academic program. This includes programs which lead to credential or licensure, requires accreditation, entails extraordinary progr am costs, and aligns with traditional academic offerings of the institution. Based on the information provided in the proposal, staff finds that the request to assess the professiona l fee meets policy requirements. ISU's request to create a new Master of Social Work is consistent with their Statewide Program Responsib ilities and their Five-year Plan for Delivery of Academic Programs in Region V and VI. Consistent with Board Policy III.Z, BSU has the statewide program responsibility fo r Master of Social Work with a shared responsibility with ISU in Regions V and IV.

This proposal form must be completed for the creation of each new program and each program discontinuation . All questions must be answered. 1. Describe the nature of the request . Will this program be related or tied to other programs on campus? Please identify any existing program, option that this program will replace. If this is request to discontinue an existing program, provide the rationale for the discontinuance. Indicate the year and semester in which the last cohort of students w as admitted and the final term the college will offer the program. Describe the teach- out plans for continuing students. The Department of Sociology, Social Work, and Criminal Justice at Idaho State University is currently accredited to offer a B achelor of Arts (BA) degree in social w ork. We now wish to add a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree. Currently, our BA program prepares graduates for generalist professional practice. A new MSW program would prepare graduates for advanced professional practic e in an area of concentration within the field of social work through mastery of a core set of competencies as set forth by the Council on Social Work Education (CSWE), our national accrediting body. MSW level social workers apply knowledge and skills of advanced social work practice. Per CSWE accreditation standards, MSW professionals assess, intervene and evaluate in order to promote human and social well -being in ways that are differentiated, discriminating and self -critical. They apply a wide- range of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary knowledge and skills. In addition, MSW -educated social workers refine and advance the quality of social work practice through research. Two options for the MSW degree would be offered: 1) a one- year, advanced standing MSW program which would be an efficient graduate education option for those students who complete their BA degrees in social work at ISU or another CSWE accredited programs; 2) a traditional two- year program for students who have completed non-social work BA degrees. Given the current state of the profession for employment opportunities , Southeast Idaho (Regions 5 & 6) community need, and ISU student need, an MSW program at ISU is necessary. Our purpose is to develop a quality, primarily seated, MSW program. Boise State University offers its MSW program both on campus and fully online. BSU has primary statewide responsibility for Social Work Programs in Idaho (Idaho State Board of Education, 2013, Governing Policies and Procedure. Boise, Idaho); however, ISU is given shared responsibility for programs in Region 5 & 6. Given SE Idaho's student base of first generation students and face- to-face learning styles , a fully online program offered to Idaho students will not adequately meet student learning needs within the State or the need for qualified professionals within our profession and community. We are proposing an option for students which will be based on quality, face- to-face interactions with intense faculty supervision and c ontact . Given the nature of social work, a student must graduate from an accredited program in order to be eligible for licensure within the state (Idaho Administrative Code IDAPA 24.14.01 - Rules of the State Board Bureau of Occupational Licenses of Social Work Examiners, Section 100, Page 3) . We are proposing our program be placed on the 4- year Candidacy Model for accreditation through the Council of Social Work Education. Steps are outlined in which the program works closely with CSWE to meet accreditat ion standards. Students enrolled in the program through the candidacy process will be considered as graduates from an accredited program only if the program is fully accredited at the end of the candidacy process . Thus, financial commitment for fully staffing the program and providing necessary resources is essential in order to achieve accreditation and offer a quality program. Granted, MSW programs appear to be expensive as the faculty to student ratio needs to meet accreditation standards. However, the program will generate tuition and fees and recent surveys of student and community interest has demonstrated that a MSW Program at ISU has the capacity to be filled. Thus, if the program is started, it must be sustained; we cannot jeopardize student ability to be employed and licensed when they start the program while under candidacy for accreditation. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 6In sum, w e are proposing to offer a quality, cost effective educational experience for students in Southeast Idaho. Students will be able to participate in seated practice classes which will enable graduates to effectively work with people in the field. Having face- to-face contact with faculty and fellow students prepares students to practice ethically as social work is a profession which values human relationship and sees the need/strength in human interactions (NASW Code of Ethics). 2. List the objectives of the program. The objectives should address specific needs the program will meet . They should also identify and the expected student learning outcomes and achievements. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. The program will be based on successfully addressing specific social work Core Competencies as required by CSWE in EPAS 2015 (approved by CSWE, March 20, 2015): . 1. Demonstrate Ethical and Professional Behavior. 2. Engage Diversity and Difference in Practice. 3. Advance Human Rights and Social, Economic, and Environmental Justice. 4. Engage in Practice-Informed Research and Research- Informed Practice. 5. Engage in Policy Practice. 6. Engage with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities. 7. Assess Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities. 8. Intervene with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities. 9. Evaluate Practice with Individuals, Families, Groups, Organizations, and Communities . (CSWE, EPAS 2015, http://www.cswe.org/File.aspx?id=79793 ) Our proposed MSW program will also have an emphasis in three areas, which reflect current department strengths: (a) gender and sexuality, (b) clinical work with children and families including child welfare, and (c) forensic social work. In addition to required courses, students may take elective courses in one of these areas for certificate of specialty. Social work students are trained as generalists during undergraduate education before building on advanced generalist and more specialized training during their graduate education. Thus, MSW graduates are well -prepared to address a variety of social and community issues at multiple levels. These include substance abuse prevention and treatment, community planning, rural health, mental health, gerontology issues, child and family development, and criminal justice issues. 3. Briefly describe how the institution will ensure the quality of the program (i.e., program review ). Will the program require specialized accreditation (it is not necessary to address regional accreditation) ? If so, please identify the agency and explain why you do or do not plan to seek accreditation. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. The ISU BA degree in social work is accredited through CSWE. CSWE is also the accrediting body for all MSW programs in the United States. Quality is assured through accreditation as progr ams are required to meet specific components which are regularly monitored. Consistent with CSWE accreditation procedure for the BA program, our proposed MSW program goals and outcomes will be established along with measurable objectives and outcomes as required by CSWE. Faculty members are committed to developing and maintaining a quality program based on core ethical principles as outlined by the NASW Code of Ethics. As social work is a profession based on the core principle of the value of human relationships (NASW Code of Ethics), students will have the opportunity to develop relational skills and integrative knowledge through face- to-face practice courses INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 7and quality field placements. For social work students, the implicit curriculum is as important as the explicit curriculum (CSWE) . Our faculty members are committed to developing a quality program utilizing current research on what social workers need for development of clinical skills. For instance, a recent position paper based on research by the Clinical Social Work Association (September 2013 ) highlights the critical need for clinical social workers (MSW level) to have the opportunity to dev elop relational skills and integrative knowledge. In addition, faculty knowledgeable in required field education will assist in designing and monitoring quality practice courses to ensure that student learning of practice concepts are ta ught and monitor ed through face- to-face instruction. 4. List new courses that will be added to your curriculum specific for this program. Indicate number, title, and credit hour value for each course. Please include course descriptions for new and/or changes to courses . This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. The following credits will be required for the proposed MSW options at ISU : 60 graduate credits would be required for traditional two-year program. 45 graduate credits (including 12 field credits) would be required for advanced standing program.

University of Utah is 45 credits for advanced standing, 60 for two- year traditional. University of Montana only offers a two-year traditional program at 60 credits. Utah State University is 36 credits for advanced standing, 60 for two- year traditional. Northwest Nazarene University offers an advanced standing program although credit hours are not clearly stated online, 60 credits are required for a two- year traditional program. Walla Walla University (Missoula) is 54 quarter credits for advanced standing, 82 quarter credits for two -year traditional.

Describe additional requirements such as preliminary qualifying examination, comp rehensive examination, thesis, dissertation, practicum or internship, some of which may carry credit hours included in the list above. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Accredited MSW programs do not require comprehensive examinations or a thesis. However, CSWE does require 900 hours of supervised field education (practicum) that is part of the curriculum. Field education hours are assigned course numbers with credits, similar to our current BA program (which requires 400 hours of field education per CSWE accreditation). We already have strong working relationships with dozens of social service agencies and field educators across southeast Idaho that are established through our BA program. Students would be required to cont ribute to the field of knowledge in the profession through completion of a research project and/or manuscript suitable for submission to a professional journal. Currently there is a dearth of PhD social workers in the profession. Preparing our student for further study at the PhD level would contribute to the profession and the future employability for those students interested in employment within academia. 7.

Describe the methodology for determining enrollment projections. If a survey of student interest was conducted, attach a copy of the survey instrument with a summary of results as Appendix B . This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. We constructed a survey (attached in Appendix B) to gather information about interest in our potential MSW program. We designed an 8- question survey using Survey Monkey and invited 846 people to participate, using our mailing lists for current students, alumni, and active social workers. We had a response rate of 23%, as 191 people participated. The survey asked about current educational attainment level, interest in an MSW program, type of program interested in, and factors that are important in choosing an MSW program. According to our interest survey, 50 current students and 36 BSW's working in the Social Work field indicated that they would be \"extremely likely\" to enroll in a MSW program at ISU if one were available. This leads to a projected enrollment of 86 students. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 13Other relevant information learned from the survey is that funding/cost of program, quality of faculty, geographic location and type of program were rat ed as the most important factors in choosing an MSW program (in that order). The type of program most desired was Advanced Standing, Full -time MSW program, and combined BSW and MSW program (in that order). Importantly, 84% of survey participants plan to seek employment in Idaho. 9. Enrollment and Graduates.

Will this program reduce enrollments in other programs at your institution? If so, please explain. The enrollment in other programs at Idaho State University will not be impacted. Students who earn a BA in Social Work from ISU typically go on to gain their masters in another area which creates hardship in terms of expense and travel. With a local program, students will be able to concentrate their time on study and remain engaged in the local community while earning their degree. The Masters in Counseling Program at ISU offers BA level students an alternative to traveling for their MSW. However, advanced standing is not recognized and the perspective of the social work and counseling professionals is distinct. In the last five years, only 3 social work students have applied for and been admitted to the counseling program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 1411.

Particularly in Idaho, economic data and forecasts indicate that social work related jobs are likely to be one of the top areas of growth not only in the next few years but likely throughout the next decade. Such growth will form an increasingly important part of Idaho's economy and will also support a range of other economic opportunities connected to both education and research.

Is the program primarily intended to meet needs other than employment needs, if so, please provide a brief rationale. The program is primarily intended to meet employment needs. 12. Will any type of distance education technology be utilized in the delivery of the program on your main campus or to remote sites? Please describe. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Some courses may be offered via distance education technology, but practice courses will require students to be in seated classrooms so that students can practice skills in a supervised setting and faculty can observe skill attainment . This is co nsistent with pedagogy analysis and recommendations recently reported by the Clinical Social Work Association (CSWA). Courses that can be offered in a quality manner via distance education can be offered utilizing technology already available and accessibl e in the Department. 13. Describe how this request is consistent with the State Board of Education's strategic plan and institution's role and mission. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. SBOE Strategic Plan The State Board of Education's Strategic Plan for FY 2015- 2019 titled \"An Idaho Education: High Potential - High Achievement\", envisions an \"accessible, seamless public education system that results in a highly educated citizenry\". Goal 1 of the strategic plan aims for \"o pportunities for individual advancement\". The State Board states under objective B for this goal, \"to increase the educational attainment of all Idahoans through participation and retention in Idaho's educational system.\" One of the benchmarks explicitly t argets graduate education with the aim of increasing the percentage of Idahoans with a graduate degree by 8% by 2020. Adding the Master Program in Social Work to the Eastern part of Idaho will help achieve this goal. Many of our current undergraduate stude nts in social work or social workers in our communities cannot leave this area to attain a graduate degree. A graduate program here in Eastern Idaho will provide the opportunity for graduate education, thus increasing the percentage of Idahoans with a graduate degree. As of February 18, 2015, there are a total of 488 social workers holding LSW licenses in SE Idaho (IBOL). The LSW license is attainable with a Bachelor's Degree. Since several agencies within the field are moving towards minimum master degree requirements, many of these social workers will need to obtain an MSW degree in order to be competitive in the job market. Goal 2 of the strategic plans aims for \"provid(ing) an environment for the development of new ideas, and practical and theoret ical knowledge to foster the development of individuals who are entrepreneurial, broadminded, think critically, and are creative\". Graduate programs by default go beyond teaching fundamental knowledge and foster critical thinking and innovation. Researc h and teaching are always intertwined in graduate education which not only enhances critical thinking skills, but contributes to research projects and thus development of new ideas and solutions for our society. Graduate students are vital for faculty research and the ability to conduct research and garner external funding for their projects. A new graduate program will enhance opportunities for garnering external grant money. Role of Idaho State University Idaho State University provides a wide variety of educational, training, research, continuing education and service programs to meet the personal and professional needs of Idaho citizens and Idaho employers and is responsible for planning and determining the best means to deliver Service Region Programs that respond to the educational and workforce needs of its service region. Region IV, V, INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 16and VI have been assigned to Idaho State University. While Boise State University has the statewide program responsibility for MSW programs; Idaho State University s hares responsibility for assessing and delivering Master programs in Social Work in region V and VI. Idaho State University Mission \"The mission of Idaho State University is to advance scholarly and creative endeavor through the creation of new knowledge, cutting edge research, innovative artistic pursuits and high quality academic instruction; to use these achievements to enhance technical, undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, health care services, and other services provided to the people of Idaho and the nation; and to develop citizens who will learn from the past, think critically about the present, and provide leadership to enrich the future in a diverse, global society. Idaho State University is a public research institution which serves a diverse population through its broad educational programming and basic, translational, and clinical research. Idaho State University serves and engages its communities with health care clinics and services, professional technical training, early college oppor tunities, and economic development activities. The University provides leadership in the health professions and related biomedical and pharmaceutical sciences, as well as serving the region and the nation through its environment al science and energy programs.\" (Idaho State University, 2014). In a Master Program in Social Work program, teaching, learning, and research are fully intertwined. Faculty incorporates aspects of their research into lectures. Students in the program learn practice and research skil ls, and creativity and problem solving are encouraged. Students are involved in faculty research projects. Students in the MSW program will come from a variety of backgrounds. Several of the students in our assigned regions are from Hispanic or Native American ethnicities. Some of our students are middle- aged and going back to college after gaining more life experience. Many students are first generation college graduates. We will give students unique opportunities by nurturing their talents. Social work is sometimes formally connected with the Health Sciences. A key purpose of social work as a profession is to increase the quality of life for all people, and this goal is inextricably linked to health sciences. We work with individuals and families, groups, neighborhoods and communities to increase overall health and wellbeing. Medical social work is a well -established and growing area of the field. Social work is extremely involved in the community. Students are required to complete internships in agenci es and organizations in our area, and several obtain jobs in those organizations following their graduation.

Describe how this request fits with the institu tion's vision and/or strategic plan. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Goals of Institution Strategic Mission Proposed Program Plans to Achieve the Goal INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 17The mission of Idaho State University is to advance scholarly and creat ive endeavor through the creation of new knowledge, cutting edge research, innovative artistic pursuits and high quality academic instruction; to use these achievements to enhance technical, undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, health care services, and other services provided to the people of Idaho and the nation; and to develop citizens who will learn from the past, think critically about the present, and provide leadership to enrich the future in a diverse, global society. The Master program in Social Work fits well into the mission of ISU. The program will advance scholarly endeavors ; we will involve graduate students in the creation of new knowledge and cutting- edge research, and we will uphold high quality in our instruction. Our program will produce effective social work practitioners, cosmopolitan citizens, critical thinkers, and skilled leaders. CORE THEME ONE: LEARNING AND DISCOVERY - Idaho State University promotes an environment that supports learning and discovery through the many synergies that can exist among teaching, learning, and scholarly activity. Teaching and research will go hand -in-hand in the MSW program. The program will combine practice, professional development and research within the social work profession. One of the core competencies of social work as outlined by CSWE i s for students to understand and apply the link from research to practice. Our faculty is very active in research and brings cutting- edge knowledge and research experience to the classroom. CORE THEME TWO: ACCESS AND OPPORTUNITY - Idaho State University provides opportunities for students with a broad range of educational preparation and backgrounds to enter the university and climb the curricular ladder so that they may reach their intellectual potential and achieve their goals and objectives. We will off er access to students from diverse backgrounds, and embracing human diversity is a key standard of the social work profession. Because social work utilizes a generalist model, which incorporates knowledge from related disciplines (i.e., sociology, psycholo gy, counseling, etc.), we encourage students with diverse backgrounds to apply to our program. Our small student -teacher ratio will enable us to tutor and advise students extensively. We utilize various resources from across campus to support students. CORE THEME THREE: LEADERSHIP IN THE HEALTH SCIENCES - Idaho State University values its established statewide leadership in the health sciences with primary emphasis in the health professions. We offer a broad spectrum of undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate training. We deliver health- related services and patient care throughout the State in our clinics and postgraduate residency training sites. We are committed to meeting the health professions workforce needs in Idaho. We support professional devel opment, continuing education, and TeleHealth services. We are active in Health Sciences research. The MSW program includes content across the curriculum that is directly relevant to Health Sciences. An important area of social work is medical social work, and our program will offer specific electives pertaining to health and medicine. We have community partnerships and field education sites in health and medical settings. The program will teach students the necessary research and theoretical tools to conduct research in the health sciences. Faculty engages in health- related research (e.g. patient support groups, gerontology, trauma) and will involve students in these projects. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 18CORE THEME FOUR: COMMUNITY ENGAG EMENT AND IMPACT - Idaho State University, including its outreach campuses and centers, is an integral component of the local communities, the State and the intermountain region. It benefits the economic health, business development, environment, and culture in the communities it serves. The Social Work program will regularly collaborate with community groups and organizations. The curriculum of the MSW includes field practicums and we will employ many field education sites across eastern Idaho which will help provide training for our students. We will also support these organizations by providing seminars and ongoing Continuing Education. Our faculty members serve on planning committees and advisory boards for community agencies. We will involve our stude nts in this community service, too. Community leaders comprise our Social Work Advisory Board. This Board meets with faculty of our undergraduate program in Social Work each year to discuss community needs and to maintain high quality social work education that translates into effective professional practice . The department and the social work program are involved in ongoing efforts to build strategic community - academic partnerships. 15. Is the proposed program in your institution's Five -Year plan? Indicate below. This question is not applicable to requests for discontinuance. Yes X No If not on your institution's Five-Year plan, provide a justification for adding the program. 16. Explain how students are going to learn about this program and wher e students are going to be recruited from (i.e., within institution, out- of-state, internationally). For requests to discontinue a program, how will continuing students be advised of impending changes and consulted about options or alternatives for attaining their educational goals? There are several different ways that students will learn about the MSW program. The Bachelors of Social Work program will offer an excellent opportunity to recruit students for the MSW program. Many of these students already plan to go on to attend graduate school in social work, so these students will be recruited to continue their studies at ISU through the MSW program. One unique feature of the program we are proposing is the opportunity for students to apply for conditional acceptance to the MSW program when applying to the BSW program. Because of the Advanced Standing Program option, high- achieving students with promise could be considered for automatic entry into the MSW advanced standing program upon successful completion of their Bachelors in Social Work. Students will also be recruited from other bachelor level programs such as psychology, anthropology, education etc. As the field of social work becomes increasingly more competitive, many professionals with bachelor's level degrees are returning to school to receive their MSW's. Therefore, professionals in this community and in many other surrounding communities will offer a large pool for recruitment. Due to the nature of the social work program, there is already a relationship between the social work faculty and many of the agencies in the community. This will allow for recruitment of professionals in the field who are interested in increasing their educational level. Students will also be recruited from out -of-state. The MSW programs emphasis on nationally important fields of study including social work in criminology, trauma based child welfare work and INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 19gender and sexuality, will be a draw to students from all across the country as no other MSW programs in the nation are currently offering some of these specialties. 17. In accordance with Board Policy III.G., an external peer review is required for any new doctoral program. N/A 1 8. Program Resource Requirements. Using the Excel spreadsheet provided by t he Office of the State Board of Education indicate all resources needed including the planned FTE enrollment, projected revenues, and estimated expenditures for the first three fiscal years of the program. Include reallocation of existing personnel and res ources and anticipated or requested new resources. Second and third year estimates should be in constant dollars. Amounts should reconcile budget explanations below . If the program is contract related, explain the fiscal sources and the year -to-year commi tment from the contracting agency(ies) or party(ies). Provide an explanation of the fiscal impact of the proposed discontinuance to include impacts to faculty (i.e., salary savings, re- assignments). a. Personnel Costs Faculty and Staff Expenditures Project for the first three years of the program the credit hours to be generated by each faculty member (full - time and part -time), graduate assistant, and other instructional personnel. Also indicate salaries. After total student credit hours, convert to an FT E student basis. Please provide totals for each of the three years presented. Salaries and FTE students should reflect amounts shown on budget schedule. Name, Position & Rank Annual Salary Rate FTE Assignment to this Program Projected Student Credit Hour s FTE Students Field Director, MSW 51,000 1 1,530 240 Assistant Professo r, Director 55,000 1 1,350 450 Assistant Professor 52,000 1 1,350 450 Accreditation requires a total of 6 faculty position whose principal duties are with the MSW progr am. The majority of the faculty members in a MSW program have to be PhD level faculty. Accreditation for the BA program in Social Work requires at least 2 faculty members whose principal assignments are with the undergraduate program. This means that in order to have a fully accredited MSW program we need at a minimum 8 faculty - 2 faculty in the BA program and 6 faculty positions in the MSW program. The MSW program can obtain accreditation over a 3 or 4 year period. In year one - at visit one by th e accrediting body - we need three full-time faculty dedicated to the MSW program; at year two, we need five faculty, and six faculty in year three or four . In our program, we will need one additional position in year one which will be the director for the MSW program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 20 Over the next three years, we need to add the three additional positions: two PhDs and one MSW (for the field director position dedicated to the BSW program - we need two field directors; one for the BA program and one for the MSW program. Both of these positions can be clinical faculty on a non- tenure track position.) The estimates of projected credit hours over three years are based on 50 students in the BSW program and 25 students in the MSW program in the first year, 50 MSW students in the second year, and 75 MSW students in the 3rd year. Practicum courses taught by the field directors are offered for 6 credits per section and semester . Project the need and cost for support personnel and any other personnel expenditures for the first three years of the program. Administrative Expenditures Describe the proposed administrative structure necessary to ensure program success and the cost of that support. Include a statement concerning the involvement of other departments, colleges, or other institutions and the estimated cost of their involvement in the proposed program Per accreditation standards, the MSW program will need a director with 0. 50 of his/her workload dedicated to the position and a field director, also with 0. 50 of his/her workload dedicated to that position. The director of the MSW program needs to be a tenure- track faculty member with a terminal degree in the field. The field director can be a faculty member with a MSW degree and can be hired as a clinical or non- tenure track faculty member . The department currently has one administrative assistant assigned to the Social Work program at .75 FTE. 50% of the current workload of this administrative assistant can be reallocated to the new MSW program to cover the necessary administrative tasks associated with the MSW. Operating Expenditures Briefly explain the need and cost for operating expenditures (travel, professional services, etc.) Travel - faculty will need to travel to CSWE conferences once a year. The department does not have a travel budget. Costs to cover the CSWE conference participation come from student professional fees , social work faculty generated funds through offering continuing education units to the community, and competitive travel grants. Costs: $ 1,500 for one conference visit per year Accreditation Fees - we plan to have the program fully accredited by year 4. During year 1 , 2 and 3 accreditation visits will take place to check progress towards accreditation (Appendix D). The program will need to pay annual accreditation fees, membership dues, candidacy fees, eligibility fees, and two commissioner site visits , and initial accreditation fees (Appendix E). After year 4, the program will need to pay annual program membership dues /accreditation fees, and every seven years the program will need to cover the costs for accreditation visits . These costs will be covered by professional fees charged to students.

Adding another graduate program would require additional materials and supplies . Due to already existing cost and expense sharing between the programs in the department, we estimate the need for an additional graduate program to amount to less than one fifth of the current operating budget. Costs: $2, 000 Communications - will be included in current communications budget in department. Costs: $0 Capital Outlay (1) Library resources (a) Evaluate library resources, including personnel and space. Are they adequate for the operation of the present program? If not, explain the action necessary to ensure program success.

(c) For off -campus programs, clearly indicate how the library resources are to be provided. Dept. of Sociology, Social Work & Criminal Justice February 12, 2015 Dear Dr. Hearn: I offer the Library's assessment of the proposed Masters in Social Work below. I have not seen the NOI form, and instead basing my response on conversations with you describing the program. From that discussion, I learned that there is an equivalent program currently being offered by Boise State University (BSU), so have based some of this assessment on the holdings of that library. The Library is fairly well- positioned to support this program, and this assessment recommends a modest amount be included with the NOI for library support from new funds outside the Library. Books The Library allocated $6,102.00 during the 2014/2015 fiscal year to books and standing orders in the area of Sociology, Social Work & Criminal Justice. This amount is used to support existing programs within the department of the same name. A liaison within the department, in collaboration with a member of the library staff, works to select materials for entry into the collection. Many of the core reference works noted in The Walford Guide to Reference Resources are currently held by the Library. These include Reference Sources in Social Work, A Guide to Information Sources for Social Work and the Human Services, The Social Work Dictionary, Social Welfare in America, and Encyclopedia of Social Work. Additionally, the Library holds all seven Reference Works published by the National Association of Social Workers. Additionally, a comparison with the B SU Library collection reveals that ISU's holdings in this field are INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 22healthy. Common holdings include: City and County Extra, Encyclopedia of American Social History, Housing Statistics of the United States, Mental Measurement Yearbook, and Statistical Abst ract of the United States. Additionally, ISU holds Social Work Research and Abstracts. A keyword search on the phrase \"social work\" in the BSU Library catalog resulted in 2921 hits. The same search in the ISU Library catalog resulted in 2421 hits based on the 2008 report. I recommend no increase in the reference books (standing order) budget, and a small increase in the books budget as a result. Suggested Permanent Increase for Books: $ 2,000.00 Journals The Library allocated $20,081.00 during the 2014/2015 fiscal year to journals in the subject area of Sociology, Social Work & Criminal Justice. Subscription decisions are primarily in the hands of the faculty within that department. Of the five publications of the National Association of Social Worker s, the Library currently subscribes to one in print, three online and offers at least 2000 and forward access in electronic version to the remainder via its full text subscription to ten EBSCOhost databases. Of the fourteen commercially produced journals listed on the BSU Library Social Work resources page (http://guides.boisestate.edu/socialwork} ISU holds current -year subscriptions to eight and for the remainder two offers online access with an 18 months embargo via its full text subscription to EBSCOhos t Education Research Complete and Academic Search Complete databases. The four that ISU lacks are Journal of Community Practice, Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, Journal of Social Work (JSW), and Journal of Teaching in Social Work. After pricing these journals, I concur with Sandra Shropshire recommendation that an increase be made to purchase them. Suggested Permanent Increase for Journals: $2,974.00 Indexes The ISU Library has current access to a number of directly or indirectly relevant indexes, based on sources cited above. The following electronic article indexes are held: Social Work Abstracts, Social Science Abstracts, Socfndex, Sociological Collection, Social Sciences Citation Index, Le., Web of Science, ClNAHL, Cochrane Library, Psyclnfo, Lexis/Nexis Statistical and Academic, and Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection. I recommend no increase for Indexes. Suggested Permanent Increase for Indexes: 0.00 Other Resources The ISU Library is a selective federal depositor y, and as such, receives on subscription a broad range of publications from United States agencies. It offers access to additional collections of interest, including publications of the State of Idaho and of the United Nations. Suggested Permanent Increase for Other Resources: 0.00 Services and Facilities The ISU Library provides access to materials outside its collection by offering free interlibrary loan services to students and faculty. Other services include reference service, introductory and customized instruction service and both print and electronic course reserve. Suggested Permanent Increase for Services and Facilities: 0.00 Total Suggested Increase to Permanent Library /Funds to Support M.S.W.: 4,974.00 Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about this assessment. Sincerely, Sandra Shropshire Associate University Librarian for Collections and Technical Services (2) Equipment/Instruments Describe the need for any laboratory instruments, computer(s), or other equipment. List equipment, which is presently available and any equipment (and cost) which must be obtained to support the proposed program. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 23Currently available equipment and labs: Social Work Interaction Lab - social work students are able to practice role playing, observe interactions, and record their practicing interviews to develop practice skills. It includes one laptop computer, projector, mixer, screen, TV monitor, microphone, and camera for interview transmission and taping. Smart Room - instructors ca n use this room for long distance education or video conferencing. It includes a computer, a multimedia projector, and an interactive pen display monitor. Social Work Library - social work books IFFT Social Scie nce Research Lab in the department (shared with MA program in Sociology) - six computer stations available for graduate students. Ten computer labs available on the Pocatello campus ; one computer lab is located on the same building where the department is located. Additionally, there are four computer labs on the Idaho Falls campus . Maintenance: replacement or repair of broken equipment; service calls for malfunctioning equipment Estimated Costs per year: $2 00 Equipment Needed for faculty: each new hired faculty member will need a computer work station. We have no funding for computer needs in our current appropriated budget. Estimated costs: $1,200 for three newly hired faculty members = $3,600 d. Revenue Sources (1) If funding is to come from the reallocation of existing state appropr iated funds, please indicate the sources of the reallocation. What impact will the reallocation of funds in support of the program have on other programs? Initially, reallocation of resources within department and the different programs in department . Impact: some decreased resources in other programs in the department; lower enrollment in BSW program which will be compensated with enrollment in MSW program. Two faculty members who are currently assigned to the undergraduate program in Social Work will be assigned to the MSW program, thus reducing the fully assigned faculty members for the undergraduate program. The administrative assistant currently assigned to Social Work at 75% time will maintain 25% of his time to support the undergraduate program; 50% of his/her time will be re- assigned to the MSW program. Materials and supplies allotted to the department will be shared with the MSW program thus only necessitating some increase in the materials and supplies budget for the MSW program. (2) If the funding is to come from other sources such as a donation, indicate the sources of other funding. What are the institution's plans for sustaining the program when funding ends? N/A (3) If an above Maintenance of Current Operations (MCO) appropriation is required to fund the program, indicate when the institution plans to include the program in the legislative budget request. N/A (4) Describe the federal grant, other grant(s), special fee arrangements, or contract(s) to fund the program. What does the institution propose to do with the program upon termination of those funds? N/A (5) Provide estimated fees for any proposed professional or self -support program. $ 200 per semester INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 10 Page 24APPENDIX A CURRICULUM AND COURSES Courses Required for Traditional Two -Year MSW Prog ram SOWK 5..

There are a total of 488 licensed BSW's in Southeast Idaho according to the Idaho Bureau of Occupational licenses. A generous estimate of half of the percentage who said they were extremely likely to attend ISU, results in an enrollment projection of 163 students from the community (33.5% of 488); a conservative estimate of 10% results in an enrollment projection of 48 students from the community.* We have approximately 70 students enrolled in our BSW program now. According to Social Work faculty, about 75% of those students would go on to earn an MSW. Using that percentage as a generous estimate, 52 students could be expected to enroll in our program. A more conservative estimate of 50% would result in a projection estimate of 35 students. In total, a generous estimate results in a projection of 215 students and a conservative estimate results in a projection of 83 students that we could expect to enroll in our MSW program. Other relevant information learned from the survey is that funding/cost of program, quality of faculty, geographic location and type of program were rated as the most important factors in choosing an MSW program (in that order). The type of program most desired was Advanced Standing, Full -time MSW program, and combined BSW and MSW program (in that order). Importantly, 84% of survey participants plan to seek employment in Idaho. * A more conservative estimate was used for potential students in the community because not all of those who hold a BSW in the community participated in our survey.

APPLICABLE STATUTE, RULE, OR POLICY Idaho State Board of Education Po licy III.Y. Advanced Opportunities. BACKGROUND/DISCUSSION At its February 2016 meeti ng, the State Board's Inst ruction, Research, and Student Affairs (IRSA) Committee asked B oard staff to assemble a workgroup consisting of represent ative stakeholders from higher education and K-12 education to bring forward a set of re commendations to make improvements to Idaho's dual credit program. In close consultation with State Department of Educat ion staff, the substantive focus of the work was divided into three categories: teac hers, courses and administrative procedures. On aver age, each of the three groups met approximately weekly over five weeks to develop their recommendations. The recommendations were discussed among B oard and Department staff, distilled down to one set of recommendations, and then returned to the workgroup members for their approval. The reco mmendations are an amalgamation of the three subcommittees' recommendations. The recommendations were presented to and discussed by IRSA at its July 21 and September 29 meetings. Similarly, these recommendations were presented to and discussed by CAAP at its August 25 and September 15 meetings. Additionally, during a September 1 phon e call, Board staff discussed each recommendation with Adam Lowe, Executive Dir ector of the National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships (N ACEP). Mr. Lowe commended the Board for undertaking this work and consider ing these recommendations, which he noted do not conflict with NACEP accredita tion standards and are consistent with the direction NACEP and many states are moving towards. The recommendations were brought before t he Board as an information item and discussion item at the October 2016 Board meeting. The recommendations include: 1. Providing scholarships/incentives for current high school t eachers who want to take the necessary courses to be ce rtified to teach dual credit courses. 2. For those students who take academic dual credit courses, make the General Education Matriculation (GEM) framew ork, defined in Board Policy III.N. General Education, the focus. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 2 3. Requiring institutions and high schools to work jointly to identify alternatives to commercial text books, especially for GEM courses. 4. Encouraging the instit utions to offer more evening, summer, and online courses/programs specific to dual credit credentialing. 5. Standardizing more meaningful intake processes and orientations for both post-secondary faculty and the approved high school faculty. 6. Standardizing the site visit process by which high school dual credit teachers are evaluated. Include a requirement that building administrators be notified of site visits prior to the classroom visit. 7. Identifying each institution's minimum requirements for an instructor to teach dual credit sorted by instit ution and discipline, and post this information in a single location. 8. Creating a standard template for voluntary use by districts and institutions regarding methods and levels of com pensation processes and amounts for dual credit teachers. 9. Providing a state sponsored one or two day statewide institute for dual credit instructors to learn more about guidelines, policy re quirements and changes, and other relevant matters. 10. Identifying who approves applicant s to teach dual credit courses, how applicants are approved, and post this info rmation in a centralized location. 11. Gathering from the institut ions their respective hiring practices for dual credit instructors and posting this informa tion in a centralized location. 12. Administering through the Board office , the dual credit enrollment participant survey. IMPACT The adoption and implementation of t hese recommendations offers an opportunities to provide consistency and transparency of processes; generate greater efficiencies, such as the streamlining and centralization of certain administrative functions; potentially create greater access for many rural students. This would create more acce ssible pathways for current high school teachers, particularly in rural areas to earn the necessary credentials to teach dual credit courses in their high schools.

The ongoing support and professional development is determined by the institution offering/transcripting the credits. Recommendations 7, 10, and 11 all perta in to identifying institutions' requirements for instructors (e.g. hiring practices, approval of teachers/applicants) and provid ing that information in a central location, which could be combined into a single recommendation.

INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 8Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 3 Overview This report provides a portrait of dual-credit participation rates and trends between the 2011-12 and 2014-15 school years. Dual-credit participation by demographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status is explored throughout each of the five briefs contained within this report. Each report brief also includes questions to consider\u2014which promote a deeper exploration of the data\u2014as well as next steps that can help educators and stakeholders overcome barriers to expanding dual credit. The report briefs can be read individually or together as a longer report with five content sections. The five briefs address the following questions: Who participated in dual-credit courses? What were the characteristics of districts with students who participated in dual-credit courses? In which dual-credit course competency areas were districts most likely to have participated?1 What were the pass rates of students who participated in dual-credit courses? To what degree did the state meet its goal of 30 percent of high school students participating in dual-credit courses?2 Why dual credit? Obtaining a college degree is important because an individual's level of education is linked to better employment opportunities, income, and health.3 However, the overall college completion rate at two- and-four year colleges and universities in the United States has continued to decrease.4 In an effort to support student success toward college degree completion, many states have enacted legislation and provided additional funding to increase dual-credit opportunities to expose students to college-level 1 Competency areas refer to categories of general education coursework at Idaho public postsecondary institutions. 2 The dual-credit participation rate goal of 30 percent was defined in the Idaho State Board of Education Strategic Plan, which can be found here: https:// boardofed.idaho.gov/policies/documents/strategic_plan/SBOE%20FY16%20Final.pdf 3 Levin, H., Belfield, C., Muenning, P ., & Rouse, C.

In 2014-15, 83 percent of Idaho school districts (123 of 148) had high school students who participated in dual-credit options in partner-ship with these universities. Idaho has made the expansion of dual credit a priority. In the 2016 legislative session, Idaho passed House Bill 458, which expands access to advanced opportunities through the Fast Forward Program 14\u2014including dual-credit courses offered to stu- dents in grades 7-12\u2014by providing additional funding to school districts across the state. The Fast Forward Program can pay up to $75 per credit. In most cases, the cost of these credits is $65. The program also provides juniors with $200 per year and seniors with $400 per year to cover up to 75 percent of the cost of dual-credit courses. 15 5 Zinth, J. D. (2014).

In 2014-15, slightly more than 23 per - cent of Idaho students in grades 11 and 12 participated in dual credit, which has increased by 5 percentage points since 2011-12 (figure 1). An analysis of dual-credit participation by Idaho high school students in grades 9-12 shows that the state's participation rate for these grades is comparable to the national rate of dual-credit participation: 14 percent. 17,18 In 2014-15, 13 percent of Idaho students in grades 9-12 participated in dual-credit programs with an Idaho public university or college, 19 which is an increase of 4 percentage points from 2011-12. Despite the increase in dual-credit offerings and participation, studies have shown that not all student groups\u2014including Hispanic/Latino, male, and economically disadvantaged students\u2014are equally likely to take advantage of dual-credit opportunities. 20 Moreover, school districts within the state also vary in their dual-credit participation levels\u2014from no dual-credit participation to more than 30 percent participation among high school students. Idaho State Board of Education and project goals The Idaho State Board of Education (SBOE) is the governing body and general overseer for all K-20 public education in Idaho. The SBOE also serves as the Board of Trustees for Boise State University, Idaho State University, and Lewis-Clark State College, as well as the Board of Regents for the University of Idaho. A collaborative partnership between the SBOE and Regional Educational Laboratory (REL) Northwest began in spring 2016 with the goal of analyzing gaps and trends in dual-credit participation among Idaho school districts. Data and methodology This report used aggregated data at the district and state levels over the span of four school years (2011-12 through 2014-15) to analyze dual-credit participation in grades 9-12. The SBOE aggregated all data to a district or state level and masked the identity of school districts to protect student privacy. No individual or identifiable data were used or transferred for this project. The data provided by the SBOE included aggregations by grade level for grades 9-12, race/ethnicity, gender, free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) status, course competency area, course credits attempted, and course credits earned. REL Northwest analyzed the data using descriptive statistics, such as averages and percentages, as well as regression analysis methods to identify relationships between data elements. 16 Source: Idaho State Board of Education. 17 Snyder, T.

The two most common General Education Matriculation (GEM) competency areas in which students took dual-credit courses were Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing and Mathematical Ways of Knowing. 21 The two least-common areas were Scientific Ways of Knowing and Oral Commu- nication. Across all course competency areas, 95 percent of students passed the dual-credit courses they took in 2014-15. Who participated in dual-credit courses? The analysis of student characteristics (for example, socioeconomic background, gender, and race/eth-nicity) show ed that certain student groups were more likely to participate in dual credit than others. An analysis of comparison groups of student charac teristics showed: Students from a higher socioeconomic backgr ound (that is, not eligible for FRPL) were more likely than FRPL-eligible students to take dual-credit courses. 22 Non-Hispanic/Latino students were mor e likely than Hispanic/Latino students to take dual-credit courses. Non-American Indian students wer e more likely than American Indian students to take dual-credit courses. Females were mor e likely than males to take dual-credit courses. A comparison of the share of the dual-cr edit to the overall populations showed: Higher percentages of female , non-FRPL-eligible (that is, higher socioeconomic status), and White students were in the grade 11 and 12 dual-credit population compared to their share in the overall student population, indicating their overrepresentation in the dual-credit participant population. In contrast, male, FRPL- eligible, Asian, Black, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian students were underrepresented in the grade 11 and 12 dual-credit participant population. What were the characteristics of districts with students who participated in dual-credit courses? The analysis of district characteristics looked at district size (small, medium, and large), as well as stu- dent demographics and GEM competenc y area course participation. In an analysis of district siz e characteristics and dual-credit participation, we found: A total of 123 school districts ( out of 148) had students who participated in dual-credit courses in 2014-15. Of the 123 school districts that participated in dual credit 59 districts (40 percent) were medium, 33 districts (22 percent) were small, and 31 districts (21 percent) were large. 21 GEM competency areas are part of Idaho's evolving general education framework for associate of arts, science, and baccalaureate degrees. College students can earn up to 30 of 36 required general education credits in these six GEM competency areas: Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, Mathematical Ways of Knowing, Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, Written Communication, Scientific Ways of Knowing, and Oral Communication. The remaining six credits are reserved for institutions to create competency areas that address their specific mission and goals. The six GEM competency areas are available as dual-credit courses in many Idaho high schools. 22 FRPL is provided through a Community Eligibility Provision (CEP). CEP is a meal service option for schools and school districts in low-income areas to provide breakfast and lunch to all students without collecting forms from each householdhttp://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/community-eligibility-provision INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 12Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 7 Larger school districts were more likely to have had students who participated in dual-credit courses in all six GEM competency ar eas compared to school districts with smaller numbers of students.23 Using logistic regr ession analysis,24 we found that the number of students enrolled in a district was positively related to whether or not the high school offered dual credit (statistically significant at the 1-percent level). This was true even for small districts, indicating that it is the smallest districts\u2014with the lowest high school enrollment numbers\u2014that are least likely to offer dual credit (statistically significant at the 1-percent level). In an analysis of student demographics and GEM competenc y area dual-credit course participation, we found: Districts with the highest percentage of H ispanic/Latino student enrollment25 had less dual-credit course participation in Written and Oral Communication than schools with the lowest percentage of Hispanic/Latino students. Among all other races/ethnicities, there was no relationship between the percentage of students of that demographic and the dual-credit course participation in the GEM competency areas. Districts with the highest percentage of students in po verty (as measured by FRPL)26 had more dual-credit course participation in Written and Oral Communication than schools with the lowest percentage of students in poverty. In which dual-credit course competency areas were districts most likely to have participated? In 2014-15, about 1 in 4 (22 percent) of dual-credit courses taken by students were in the Social and Behavioral W ays of Knowing GEM competency area, while 1 in 20 (5 percent) dual-credit courses were taken by students in the Oral Communication GEM competency area. The popularity of dual- credit participation among the six GEM competency areas varied among comparison groups. \"Popularity\" (or demand) is measured by the number of students who enrolled in courses in each area. For example, the competency area with the highest enrollment would represent the greatest level of popularity. In terms of the distr ict supply of courses, Idaho districts were most likely to participate in dual-credit among the following competency areas: 1) Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing; 2) Mathemati-cal Ways of Knowing; 3) Written Communication; and 4) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing. Whereas, districts were less than 55 percent likely to participate in dual-credit courses within the Oral Communication and Scientific Ways of Knowing competency areas. About 3 percent of districts par ticipate in dual-credit outside of a GEM competency area. Fifty-seven percent of districts participated in four to six of the GEM competency areas. However, 23 percent of districts had dual-credit participation in less than four GEM competency areas. 23 Dual-credit courses can be taken in any of these six General Education Matriculation (GEM) competency areas: Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, Math- ematical Ways of Knowing, Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, Written Communication, Scientific Ways of Knowing, and Oral Communication. 24 The regression analysis included covariates of: school years; district size based on high school enrollment; and percentage of students in the district who were female, Hispanic/Latino, two or more races, Asian, Native American, Black, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, White, FRPL eligible, and/or received English language learner services. 25 The highest percentages of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment is defined as the top 25 percent of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 23.2 percent. 26 The highest percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment is defined as the top 25 percent of FRPL-eligible student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 57.5 or higher. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 13Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 8 Across the six GEM competency areas, there was a dual-credit course pass rate of over 95 percent. In 2014-15, the highest pass rate among distr icts was seen in the Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing GEM competency area at 98 percent, while the lowest rate was in Oral Communication at 95 percent. The overall pass rate for dual-credit courses taken in the GEM competency areas was 96 percent in 2014-15. What were the pass rates of students who participated in dual-credit courses? Overall, students passed 95 percent of the dual-credit courses they enrolled in and earned credit at both their high school and at the associated college. A student passed if the y earned a D or better for the course grade. The dual-credit pass rat e among high school students was higher than the pass rate for college stu- dents taking lower division courses at the same colleges in Idaho. Pass rates wer e similar across different demographic groups.27 The dual-credit course pass rat e was over 95 percent across the six GEM competency areas. Pass rates var - ied somewhat across competency areas. The highest pass rates were in Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing (about 98 percent) and the lowest pass rates were in Oral Communication (about 95 percent). Pass rates varied g reatly between 63 and 100 percent across Idaho school districts. To what degree did the state meet its goal of 30 percent of high school students participating in dual-credit courses? Twenty-three percent of students in grades 11 and 12 in 2014-15 participated in dual-credit courses. Fourteen per cent of students in grades 9-12 in 2014-15 participated in dual-credit courses. Regarding the goal of 30 percent28 of all high school students (grades 9-12) participating in dual-credit courses per year among 148 school districts: Nine percent of distric ts (or 13) met or exceeded the goal Twenty-fiv e percent of districts (or 37) had between 16 and 29 percent dual-credit participation Forty-nine per cent of districts (or 73) had less than 15 percent dual-credit participation Sevent een percent of districts (or 25) had no dual-credit participation In 2014-15, 22 and 25 percent of high school juniors and seniors, r espectively, took a dual-credit course. Although the dual-credit participation rate for freshmen and sophomores has historically been lower than that of juniors and seniors, there was a slight increase in dual-credit participation among students in grades 9 and 10 between 2011-12 and 2014-15. Next steps for future research These findings provide information on dual-credit participation in Idaho and highlight areas in which further research on dual credit is needed. Areas of future research include an exploration of the relationship between dual-credit coursetaking and stu-dent college outcomes (for example, enrollment, persistence, and completion); opportunities to expand dual-credit participa-tion to all student groups (for example, by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, disability status, or gender); and barriers to the expansion of dual-credit participation (for example, teacher qualifications). 27 The pass rate is calculated using credits attempted and credits earned in dual-credit courses. Therefore, a student contributes to the \"pass rate\" if they earned credit in a course for which they were attempting credit. 28 More information may be needed to understand how to measure progress toward meeting the state strategic goal for dual-credit participation, such as a clarification as to whether the goal is 30 percent of each graduating cohort or 30 percent of all high school students in grades 9-12 in a given year. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 14Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 9While dual-credit participation has continued to increase throughout Idaho, further consideration could be given to students who were less likely to participate in dual credit and underrepresented compared to their share of the student population. Students within the following groups were less likely to participate in dual-credit courses: students from a lower socioeconom-ic status (that is, students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch [FRPL] 29) compared to those from a higher socioeconomic background; Hispanic/Latino students compared to non-Hispanic/Latino students; American Indian students compared to non-American Indian students; and males compared to females (fi gures 2-5). In terms of equity gaps measured by comparing the share of students who took dual-credit courses to their share in the overall student population, American Indian, His-panic/Latino, Hawaiian/Pacifi c Islander, Black, Asian, FRPL-eligible, and male students were underrepresented in the dual-credit participant population. In contrast, non-FRPL-eligible (that is, higher socioeconomic status), female, and White students were overrepresented in the dual-credit participant population (fi gures 6 and 7). Equity in dual-credit course participation FRPL-eligible students. On average, 39 per-cent of all Idaho students in grades 11 and 12 were FRPL eligible between 2011-12 and 2014-15. Only 17 percent of FRPL-eligible students compared to 27 percent of non-FRPL-eligible students in grades 11 and 12 participated in dual credit in 2014-15. There would need to be an increase in participation in dual-credit cours-es of approximately 10.9 percentage points (or 1,900 students) among FRPL-eligible students to bridge the gap with non-FRPL-eligible students in dual-credit participation. The overall trend of FRPL-eligible and non-FRPL-eligible dual-credit participation in grades 11 and 12 increased between 2011-12 and 2014-15 (fi gure 2).Figure 2.

On average, 16 percent of all Idaho students in grades 11 and 12 identifi ed as Hispanic/Latino between 2011-12 and 2014-15. Only 15 percent of His-panic/Latino students compared to 25 percent of non-Hispanic/Latino students in grades 11 and 12 participated in dual credit in 2014-15. There would need to be an increase in participation in dual-credit courses of approximately 9.7 percent-age points (or 732 students) among Hispanic/Latino students to bridge the gap with non-His-panic/Latino students in dual-credit participation. The overall trend of Hispanic/Latino and non-His-panic/Latino dual-credit participation increased between 2011-12 and 2014-15 (fi gure 3). American Indian students. On average, 1.25 percent of all Idaho students in grades 11 and 12 between 2011-12 and 2014-15 were American In-dian. Only 11 percent of American Indian students compared to 23 percent of non-American Indian students in grades 11 and 12 participated in dual credit in 2014-15. There would need to be an increase in participation in dual-credit courses of approximately 12.2 percentage points (or 63 stu-dents) among American Indian students to bridge the gap with non-American Indian students in dual-credit participation. The overall dual-credit participation trend for American Indian students slightly decreased, while it slightly increased for non-American Indian students in grades 11 and 12 between 2011-12 and 2014-15 (fi gure 4). Male students. On average, 51 percent of all grade 11 and 12 students in Idaho between 2011-12 and 2014-15 were male. Only 18 per-cent of male students compared to 29 percent of female students in grades 11 and 12 participated in dual credit in 2014-15. There would need to be an increase in participation in dual-credit courses of approximately 10.8 percentage points (or 2,530 students) among male students to bridge the gap with females in dual-credit participation. The overall trend of male and female dual-credit par-ticipation in grades 11 and 12 increased between 2011-12 and 2014-15 (fi gure 5).Figure 3.

In 2014-15, the following student groups were underrepresented in the dual-credit population: males compared to females, FRPL-eligible compared to non-FRPL-eligible students, and all students who were of a non-White race/ethnicity (i.e., American Indian, Hispanic/Latino, Hawaiian/Pacifi c Islander, Black, and Asian) compared to White students. Figure 6 shows underrepresentation in dual-credit participation, where the share of the dual-credit population (blue bar) was less than the share of the student population (gray bar) for that group in 2014-15. Conversely, overrepresentation in dual-credit participa-tion, where the share of the dual-credit population (blue bar) was more than the share of the student population (gray bar), was shown for females, non-FRPL-eligible, and White students. Figure 6.

What outreach programs or strategies could improve equity in dual-credit participation for underserved groups of students?Next steps Based on the identifi cation of particular barriers to dual-credit course-taking among underrepresented student groups, consider: Monitoring dual-credit participation of underrepresented student groups at the state, school district, and school levels to track equity in dual-credit participation among all student groups. Checking with school districts about their strategies to promote dual-credit coursetaking among underrepresented student groups. Identifying possible barriers to dual-credit expansion within un- derrepresented student groups. Examples of possible barriers to dual-credit expansion could include lack of communication about dual-credit options with students and families; types of dual- credit course o erings; inadequate funding for dual-credit courses; and lack of teacher accreditation to teach dual-credit courses or insu -cient dual-credit policies.Figure 7 shows the proportion of dual-credit population relative to the overall student population in a composition index. The composition index, where \"equity\" is equal to 1.0 (shown as the green line), further demonstrates equity gaps in the over- and underrepresentation of student groups. Overrepresentation in dual-credit participation was shown among student groups above the green equity line, including female, non-FRPL-eligible, and White student groups. Underrepresentation in dual-cred-it participation was among student groups below the green equity line, including male, FRPL-eligible, Asian, Black, Hawaiian/Pacifi c Islander, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian student groups. An example of how to read fi gures 6 and 7 for Hispanic/Latino students is as follows: Hispanic/Latino students represented 10.9 percent of the dual-credit population and 16.7 percent of the overall student population in 2014-15 (fi gure 6). Therefore, the proportion of Hispanic/Latino students in the dual-credit population compared to the overall student population (or composition index) was 0.7, which shows that Hispanic/Latino students were underrepresented in the dual-credit population (fi gure 7).

However, due to lack of access to data for one school district, it was removed from the fi nal results.Most districts in Idaho participated in dual credit in the 2014-15 school year, though a higher number of low-enrollment (small) districts had no dual-credit participation compared to medium- or large-enrollment districts. Smaller districts, which could be rural or remote schools, might face diff erent barriers to dual credit participation than larger urban districts. 30 Of the 25 districts that did not participate in dual credit (17 percent), 14 districts were small (9 percent), 10 districts were medium (7 percent), and 1 district was large (1 percent). A total of 123 31 of Idaho's 148 districts participated in dual credit (83 percent). Of the 123 school districts that participated in dual credit: 59 districts (40 percent) were medium, 33 districts (22 percent) were small, and 31 districts (21 percent) were large. The key to the right of fi gure 8 contains the defi nition of each district size category. While there were more small districts with no dual-credit participation, the small districts had a higher average dual-credit participation rate than medium or large districts in 2014-15. Figure 8 shows the average district dual-credit participation rate by size of enrollment among districts that had students who participated in dual credit. Small districts had a 17 percent rate of participation (blue line), followed by 15 percent for medium districts (orange line), and 13 percent for large districts (green line). Figure 8.

This was true even for small districts, indicating that it is the smallest districts\u2014with the lowest high school enrollment numbers\u2014that were least likely to participate in dual credit (statistically signifi cant at the 1-percent level). School district demographics Next, we examined the relationship between district characteristics such as demographic stu-dent breakdown and district size with the like-lihood of district dual-credit participation. This analysis shows the composition of districts that tend to participate in dual credit and identifi es the district characteristics that are associated with not participating in dual credit. This infor-mation can help the state better understand how to promote and expand dual credit. Higher percentages of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) and English language learner (ELL) students also were positively related to dual-credit participation (statistically signifi cant at the 1-percent level), indicating that schools with larger populations of these historically disad-vantaged student groups were more likely to participate in dual credit course off erings. Among districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment 33, large districts were more likely than smaller districts to participate in dual credit. Of the Idaho districts participating in dual credit with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible students, small districts had the highest rates of no dual credit participation (41 percent, or 7 of 17 districts) in 2014-15 compared to medium- and large-sized districts. Only 59 percent of small districts (or 10 of 17 districts) with the most socioeconomically disadvantaged students participated in dual credit, whereas 100 percent of medium (15 out of 15) and large (6 of 6) districts participated in dual-credit options (fi gure 9). 32 The regression analysis included covariates of: school years; district size based on high school enrollment; and percentage of students in the district who were female, Hispanic/Latino, two or more races, Asian, Native American, Black, Hawaiian/Pacifi c Islander, White, eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, and/or received English language learner services. 33 The highest percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment is defi ned as the top 25 percent of FRPL-eligible student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 57.5 or higher.Figure 9.

Larger districts with the highest percentages of ELL student enrollment were more likely to participate in dual credit relative to smaller districts. Of the districts with the highest percentages of ELL students, small districts did not participate in dual credit at the same rates as medium and large districts (25 percent, or 2 of 8 districts) in 2014-15. One medium-sized district out of 20 districts (or 5 percent) with the highest percentages of ELL enrollment had no dual-credit participation. At the same time, only 75 percent of small districts (or 6 of 8 districts) and 95 percent of medium districts (or 19 of 20) with the most ELL students participated in dual credit. All large dis-tricts (100 percent or 12 of 12) with the highest percentages of ELLs participated in dual-credit options for their students (fi gure 10). This indicates that among district sizes\u2014small, medium, and large\u2014with comparable percentages of socioeconomi-cally disadvantaged or ELL students, smaller districts had the most di culty with dual-credit course participation. District characteristics and GEM competency areas There were 123 districts with dual-credit participation in 2014-15. Of the districts participating in dual credit, most districts had dual-credit course participation in Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing (89 percent) and Mathematical Ways of Knowing (82 percent). Between 53 and 72 percent of districts participated in courses in Written Communication (72 percent), Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing (71 percent), Oral Communication (55 percent), and Scientifi c Ways of Knowing (53 percent). Most districts (94 percent) participated in dual-credit courses outside of the GEM competency areas (table 1). Table 1. Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing was the primary GEM competency area with dual-credit course participation across 123 Idaho school districts in grades 9-12, 2014-15 (sorted in descending order) GEM Competency Area Number of DistrictsPercentage of Districts with Dual Credit Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing 109 89 Mathematical Ways of Knowing 101 82 Written Communication 88 72 Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing 87 71 Oral Communication 68 55 Scientifi c Ways of Knowing 65 53 Outside of competency area 116 94 Total number of school districts 123 - Source: Authors' analysis of Idaho State Board of Education data In the period between 2011-12 and 2014-15 there was a relationship between district characteristics and GEM competency area course participation.35 For all GEM competency areas, districts with larger numbers of high school students were more likely to participate in courses in all six GEM areas (statistically signifi cant at the 1-percent level). The likelihood of a district participating in GEM courses within the Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing competency area had a particularly strong relationship with the number of high school students in the district, with every 1 percentage point increase in the number of students corresponding to a 308 percent increase in the odds of participating in at least one course in that competency area. 34 The highest percentages of ELL student enrollment is defi ned as the top 25 percent of ELL student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 6.45 or higher. 35 Indicator variables were included in the logistic regression analysis for each year to control for diff erences in dual-credit course participation from year to year. A total of 493 Idaho school districts were included in the regressions. INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 21For certain student groups, the percentage of that student group in the student population was linked to the likeli- hood of a district participating in particular courses among the GEM competency areas. A higher percentage of Hispan-ic/Latino students in a district were negatively related to Written Communication (statistically signifi cant at the 5-percent level) and in Oral Communication (statistically signifi cant at the 1-percent level) dual-credit course participation. Higher percent-ages of FRPL-eligible students were positively linked to Written Communication and Oral Communication dual-credit course participation (both results were statistically signifi cant at the 1-percent level). The percentage of White, ELL, male, and female students did not exhibit a relationship to whether a district participated in dual-credit within specifi c GEM competency areas. Next steps Based on the fi ndings from this brief, consideration may be given to: Determining whether there is equitable access to and preparation for dual-credit courses in di erent sized districts\u2014small, medium, and large. This is particularly important among small districts, where ELL and FRPL-eligible students had the least frequency of dual-credit participation. Developing a statewide strategy for conducting outreach to districts in which there is no or low dual-credit participation among the GEM competency areas. In addition to analyzing participation rates among the competency areas, research on dual-credit course o er-ings will provide additional information to consider in the expansion of options available to students. Researching the transferability of dual-credit courses from high schools to colleges/universities both in and out of state. While the pass rates in dual-credit courses are high (above 95 percent)\u2014indi-cating that students who enroll in dual-credit courses typically earn credit in those courses\u2014it is essential to better understand whether students earn credit in transferable courses.Questions to consider Why might smaller districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible and ELL students be participating in dual credit at lower rates than medium or larger districts? Why are students within districts more or less likely to participate in dual-credit courses areas across certain competency areas?

These GEM competency areas are broadly defi ned by the Idaho State Board of Education (SBOE) to help provide stu-dents who enroll in such courses with a \"common\" education. The six GEM competency areas include: Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing Mathematical Ways of Knowing Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing Scientifi c Ways of Knowing Written Communication Oral Communication The last two GEM competency areas emphasize the use of learning process skills, while the fi rst four competency areas engage students in \"ways of knowing\" to provide a range of active learning experiences. 37 Examples of the top three dual-credit cours- es taken at the state level within each of the GEM competency areas are provided in table 2.

The popularity of dual-credit participation among the six GEM competency areas varied among comparison groups. \"Popularity\" (or demand) is measured by the number of students who enrolled in courses in each area. For example, the competency area with the highest enrollment would represent the greatest level of popularity. In terms of the district supply of courses, Idaho districts were most likely to participate in dual-credit among the fol- lowing competency areas: 1) Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, 2) Mathematical Ways of Knowing, 3) Written Communication, and 4) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing. Whereas, districts were less than 55 percent likely to participate in dual-credit courses within the Oral Communication and Scientifi c Ways of Knowing competency ar-eas. Districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian students showed similar results (fi gure 11). While 17 percent of districts had no dual-credit participation, most districts off ered dual-credit courses within at least one of the six GEM competency areas. One of four (26 percent) districts had students who participated in dual credit through all six GEM competency areas (fi gure 12). Across the six GEM competency areas, there was a dual-credit course pass rate of over 95 percent. In 2014-15, the highest pass rate among districts was seen in the Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing GEM competency area at 98 percent, while the lowest rate was in Oral Communication at 95 percent. The overall pass rate for dual-credit courses taken in the GEM competency areas was 96 percent in 2014-15 (table 4). Table 3.

INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 24Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 19Top GEM competency areas with dual-credit participation: Course popularity through student enrollment Certain student groups were underrepresented among the dual-credit coursetaking population. In Idaho, free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) eligible students, Hispanic/Latino students, and male students are groups that take dual-credit courses at lower rates than their comparison groups. The rank of the GEM competency areas for each of those student groups relative to students who are not as representative of that group varied (for example, districts with the highest percentage of FRPL enrollment versus the lowest percentage of FRPL enrollment). Across all comparison groups, the most popular (or highest ranking) dual-credit courses were taken outside of a competency area. The second ranked area across all comparison groups was Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing. The popularity of competency areas deviated among comparison groups, as described below: In order of popularity for both males and females, the GEM competency areas ranked as follows: 1) Social and Behavior- al Ways of Knowing, 2) Mathematical Ways of Knowing, 3) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, 4) Written Commu-nication, 5) Scientifi c Ways of Knowing, and 6) Oral Communication. For districts with the highest 38 and lowest39 percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment the most popular GEM competency area courses, in order, were: 1) Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, 2) Mathematical Ways of Know-ing, 3) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, 4) Scientifi c Ways of Knowing, 5) Written Communication, and 6) Oral Communication. For districts with the highest 40 and lowest percentages41 of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment, the popularity of courses varied. In order of popularity for districts with the highest percentages of Hispanic/Latino enrollment, the GEM competency areas were: 1) Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, 2) Mathematical Ways of Knowing, 3) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, 4) Scientifi c Ways of Knowing, 5) Written Communication, and 6) Oral Communication. In order of popularity for districts with the lowest percentages of Hispanic/Latino enrollment, the GEM competency areas were: Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing and Written Communication. The least popu-lar areas were Mathematical Ways of Knowing, Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing, Scientifi c Ways of Knowing, and Oral Communication. This demonstrates that the popularity of dual-credit course participation within the GEM competency areas for each student comparison group varied. Dual-credit participation within the GEM competency areas: District supply of courses The supply of courses within each of the GEM competency areas varied for districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eli-gible, American Indian, or Hispanic/Latino student enrollment. Districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible, Ameri-can Indian, and Hispanic/Latino students participated in dual credit through courses outside the GEM competency areas (97 percent). In the six GEM competency areas, districts within the highest percentages FRPL-eligible, American Indian, and His-panic/Latino student enrollment primarily participated in 1) Social and Behavioral Ways of Knowing, 2) Mathematical Ways of Knowing, 3) Written Communication, and 4) Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing. Less than 55 percent (or about half ) of districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible, American Indian, or Hispanic/Latino students participated in dual-credit courses in the Oral Communication and Scientifi c Ways of Knowing competency areas (fi gure 11). 38 The highest percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment is defi ned as the top 25 percent of FRPL-eligible student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 57.5 percent. 39 The lowest percentages of FRPL-eligible student enrollment is defi ned as the bottom 25 percent of FRPL-eligible student enrollment, which is less than or equal to 35.6 percent. 40 The highest percentages of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment is defi ned as the top 25 percent of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment, which is greater than or equal to 23.2 percent. 41 The lowest percentages of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment is defi ned as the bottom 25 percent of Hispanic/Latino student enrollment, which is less than or equal to 5 percent.

Of the 148 districts in 2014-15, about 1 of 4 districts (26 percent or 38 districts) participated in dual-credit courses in all six of the GEM competency areas. In contrast, about 1 of 5 dis-tricts (17 percent or 25 districts) participated in dual-credit courses in none of the GEM competency areas (fi gure 12). 42 Figure 13 uses the information from fi gure 12 to compare the percentage of districts partici-pating in dual-credit courses in: one, two, three, four, fi ve, or six GEM competency areas from all districts in Idaho to districts with the highest percentages of FRPL-eligible, American Indian, or Hispanic/Latino student enrollment, respectively. Districts with the top FRPL-eligible student enrollment experienced 7 percent of dual-credit participation in a course outside one of the six GEM competency areas. Similarly, districts with the top Hispanic/Latino student enrollment experienced 7 percent of dual-credit participa-tion in a course outside the competency areas. Despite more participation in courses outside the competency areas among these student groups, a total of 61 percent of districts with the most FRPL-eligible students, 68 percent of districts with the most Hispanic/Latino students, and 74 percent of districts with the most American Indian students participated in dual credits in four, fi ve, and six GEM competency areas. This is a fairly equitable rate compared to all Idaho districts (68 percent of districts participating in dual-credit 42 For districts with no academic dual-credit participation, there may be participation in technical competency, Advanced Placement, or International Baccalau- reate dual-credit course options.Figure 11.

Dual-credit pass rates within GEM competency areas Nearly all students (over 95 percent) who took a dual- credit course in a GEM competency area passed it. In 2014-15, the high-est pass rate was seen in the Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing GEM competency area at 98 percent, while the lowest rate was in Oral Communication at 95 percent.

INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 27Next steps At the district level, consider developing a strategy to expand the sup- ply of dual-credit courses within all six GEM competency areas so that high school students can earn general education credit that is likely to transfer to a college degree. At the state and district levels, consider: Examining dual-credit course o erings and participation among the GEM competency areas. Dual-credit participation varied by district. Only 26 percent of districts participated in dual credit in all six com-petency areas. Further analysis of each district's dual-credit courses among the competency areas will help to determine opportunities to expand course o erings and participation across the state. Adding dual-credit o erings in areas where there are few or no course o erings, so students have an expanded set of dual-credit course options. Targeting resources for school districts with higher percentages of student groups that participate in dual-credit courses at lower rates, such as FRPL-eligible, American Indian, and Hispanic/Latino stu-dents.Questions to consider How might o ering di erent competency areas for dual-credit courses a ect which stu-dents participate in dual credit, particularly in districts with the most disadvantaged pop-ulations (for example, those with the most Hispanic/Latino and FRPL-eligible students)? What strategies might be used to expand the variety of dual-credit course o erings and participation within GEM competency areas overall and within certain student groups? What is the transferability of dual-credit courses in GEM competency areas to col-leges/universities inside and outside of Idaho? Will taking courses in certain GEM competency areas increase outcomes such as college enrollment, time to a college degree, or college degree completion? Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 22 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 28Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 23Comparing the number of credits that students attempted with the number of credits that students earned allows for an understanding of pass rates43 in dual-credit courses. A student with a grade of D or higher would be considered \"passing\" because they earned credit in the course. Pass rates for dual credit were high at over 95 percent of credits attempted between 2011-12 and 2014-15, and these rates were stable over time (fi gure 14). Pass rates by grade were similar over time, averaging 96 to 97 percent in each grade, while ranging from 93 to 100 percent within each grade over time. Addition-ally, pass rates were also similar among diff erent student groups; little variation was seen when breaking down pass rates by gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or English language learner (ELL) status. This indicates that once students were in the courses, historically disadvantaged groups did not seem to be at a disadvantage for earning credit. Despite the high pass rates in dual-credit courses for students in grades 9-12 and for demographic groups, there was variation in pass rates among districts with dual-credit participation ranging from 63 to 100 percent. Dual-credit pass rates relative to lower division college courses Pass rates for high school dual-credit courses were higher than for lower division college courses (entry-level college classes typically taken in the fi rst and second year of college). High school dual-credit course pass rates averaged 96 percent, while lower division college course pass rates averaged 83 per-cent between 2011-12 and 2014-15. With a 13 percentage point gap, this fi nding might demonstrate that diff erent groups of students take dual credit compared to the overall college population. For example, higher achievers often select into high school dual-credit courses; 44 whereas all college-going students take lower division college courses.BRIEF 4 What were the pass rates of students who participated in dual-credit courses? 43 The pass rate is calculated using credits attempted and credits earned in dual credit courses. Therefore, a student contributes to the \"pass rate\" if they earned credit in a course for which they were attempting credit. 44 Rodriguez, O., Hughes, K. L., & Belfi eld, C. (2012).

These GEM competency areas are broadly defi ned by the Idaho State Board of Education (SBOE) to help provide students who enroll in such courses with a \"common\" education. Nearly all students (over 95 percent) who took a dual-credit course in a GEM competency area passed with a D or better. In 2014-15, the highest pass rate was seen in the Humanistic and Artistic Ways of Knowing GEM competency area at 98 percent, while the lowest rate was in Oral Communication at 95 percent. The overall dual-credit pass rate for 2014-15 was 96 percent (table 5). Table 5.

Next steps Since 96 percent of students who take a dual-credit course\u2014re- gardless of race/ethnicity, gender, socioeconomic status (that is, free or reduced-price lunch eligibility), or ELL status\u2014pass the course, consider the drivers of high pass rates in these courses. At the state level, consider investigating the variation of pass rates for districts with a lower percentage of students earning credit for dual-credit courses. Discussion between school district and college/university personnel responsible for administering dual credit would be helpful in under-standing selection e ects of students who enroll in either high school dual credit or lower division college courses.Questions to consider What might be driving these relatively high pass rates in dual-credit courses at the state level? How might you expect these pass rates to change as dual credit grows in the state? What might be the di erences in the charac- teristics of students taking dual credit in high school and students taking lower division college coursework? 45 The following Idaho universities are required to provide courses within the GEM curricula: University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University, Lewis-Clark State College, Eastern Idaho Technical College, College of Southern Idaho, College of Western Idaho, and North Idaho College. Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 24 INSTRUCTION, RESEARCH AND STUDENT AFFAIRS DECEMBER 15, 2016 IRSA TAB 11 Page 30Education Northwest | Getting Ahead With Dual Credit: Dual-Credit Participation, Outcomes, and Opportunities in Idaho 25The Idaho strategic plan for education sets a benchmark for dual-credit participation at 30 percent.46 When looking at grades 9-12, 13 percent of Idaho students participated in dual credit in 2014-15. Students in all high school grades also saw an increase of 4 percentage points in dual-credit participation since 2011-12 (fi gure 15). Students tend to participate in dual credit in the later years of high school. The dual-credit participa-tion rate for Idaho students in grades 11 and 12 was 23 percent in 2014-15. There was an approximately 5 percentage point increase in dual-credit participation for students in grades 11 and 12 since 2011-12. Part of the Idaho State Board of Education mission is to increase access to dual credit for students in grades 9 and 10. Dual-credit participation among Idaho school districts District dual-credit participation rates were analyzed to capture the degree to which districts met the strategic goal of greater than or equal to 30 percent. While the dual-credit participation rate increased between 2011-12 and 2014-15, not all districts participate in dual-credit courses. In 2014-15, 17 percent of Idaho school districts (25 of 148) did not participate in dual credit. 47 About half of districts (73 of 148) had less than 15 percent dual-credit participation. A quarter of districts (37 of 148) had between 16 and 29 percent dual-credit participation. Only about 1 in 10 districts (13 of 148) had met the strategic goal of greater than or equal to 30 percent dual-credit participation in 2014-15 (fi gure 16).BRIEF 5 T o what degree did the state meet its goal of 30 percent of high school students participating in dual-credit courses? 46 Idaho State Board of Education, FY2014/2021 Strategic Plan.

However, the dual-credit participation rate for all students remained relatively stable and has increased slightly from .2 to .8 percent for students in grade 9 and from 3 to 6 percent for students in grade 10 between 2011-12 and 2014-15. In 2014-15, 22 and 25 percent of high school ju-niors and seniors, respectively, took a dual-cred-it course (fi gure 17). Grade 9 Grade 10 Grade 11 Grade 12Figure 17. Dual-credit participation in grades 9 and 10 slightly increased between 2011-12 and 2014-15 Percentage of grade 11 analysis of Idaho State Board of Education data Next steps With a statewide focus of expanding dual-credit participation to students as early as grade 7 through the Fast Forward Program, con-tinuous monitoring of these data overall and by grade level could be helpful in checking progress toward state benchmarks. Consider: Reaching out to school districts with no or low dual-credit participa- tion to determine existing barriers to participating in dual credit. Using resources and information regarding dual-credit participation to assist districts with developing school- or district-level dual-credit policies and procedures. Encouraging districts and schools to create clear course progression pathways to help counselors, students, and families understand which dual-credit courses might be appropriate for each high school grade based on prior student courses.Questions to consider What are the barriers to expanding dual cred-it in Idaho? What facilitates that expansion? What dual-credit courses are appropriate and fi t within a potential course sequence for students in grades 9 and 10? There is wide variation in dual-credit partic- ipation among school districts. How could dual-credit participation be expanded to help more school districts reach the 30 percent goal? Many school districts have no high school du- al-credit participation. What strategies could help these school districts increase dual-cred-it course participation (for example, online learning, teacher training)?
