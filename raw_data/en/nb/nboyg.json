Acupuncture can help to improve blood flow throughout your body, which boosts the oxygenation of the tissues. At Dana Park Veterinary Hospital, our vet [Dr. Sarah Mathews](/site/veterinarians-redding/dr-sarah-mathews) utilizes Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) modalities including acupuncture, herbal therapy, food therapy, and Tui-Na in order to restore your pet's health and vitality. She earned her certification in veterinary acupuncture from the Chi Institute in 2016. The Acupuncture Technique Tiny needles are inserted into an animal's body at precise points (meridians), where the blood vessels and nerves converge. The needles are used to help guide vital energy along the meridians, promoting circulation and supporting the nervous system while improving the body's natural healing abilities. Common Acupuncture Uses Our vets often recommend using acupuncture or other types of Chinese medicine for a range of issues, including: [Pain Management](#) Chemotherapy and other medical treatments can feel very uncomfortable for your pet. We will often combine them with acupuncture in an attempt to relieve some discomfort, helping your dog or cat fight their illness. [Musculoskeletal Issues](#) Acupuncture may be used to rehabilitate injuries in cats and dogs. Conditions such as hip dysplasia, nerve injuries and arthritis also tend to respond well to acupuncture. [Dermatology & Skin Issues](#) Acupuncture treatment can help promote increased circulation, which can help allergic dermatitis, hot spots and granulomas. It can also reduce pain and improve healing, leading to less itching. Bonus: this may also prevent subsequent over-grooming. [Gastrointestinal Issues](#) Acupuncture can stimulate digestive secretions, helping to encourage healthy digestive activity. Increased blood flow may benefit conditions such as nausea or diarrhea. [Respiratory Issues](#) Asthma, allergies and other conditions may improve with the immune-calming and anti-inflammatory capabilities of acupuncture treatment.
