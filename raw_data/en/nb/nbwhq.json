Operation Warp Speed is a partnership among components of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S.Department of Defense to help develop, make, and distribute millions of vaccine doses for COVID-19 as quickly as possible while ensuring that the vaccines are safe and that they work. Learn more about Operation Warp Speed by visiting https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/explaining-operation-warp-speed/index.html.Who is the CDC and what is their role with the COVID-19 vaccine? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the national public health institute in the United States under the Department of Health and Human Services. The CDC's overall responsibility is to address health and safety. The CDC is focused on vaccine planning, working closely with health departments and partners to prepare for when a vaccine isavailable. The CDC does not have a role in developing COVID19 vaccines. Learn more about the vaccine planning process by visitinghttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/8-things.htmlWhat is New Jersey doing to plan for the COVID-19 vaccine? The New Jersey Department of Health collaborated with health care partners and immunization stakeholders to submit a vaccine plan to the CDC on October 16, 2020. This plan encompasses suggested priority groups for vaccination, logistics of vaccine storage and handling, health care provider recruitment, tracking and reporting of immunizations, etc. Since no vaccine is currently available, we are closely following progress on COVID-19 vaccine trials and potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized vaccine(s). The Department will continue to update the plan as we receive new information and federal guidance Vaccine planIs a COVID-19 vaccine necessary? COVID-19 can be a minor illness in some or lead to severe disease or even death in previously healthy people. This means, everyone should take the virus seriously \u2014if not for themselves, then for those around them.Many treatments and medications are being studied, but there is no cure. Prevention is key. Vaccination is an important step in helping to prevent this illness and its potentially devastating consequences.How much will a vaccine reduce the risk of COVID-19 and its complications? The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance expects that an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine would prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated. In some cases, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus. This is why it is expected that even after a vaccine becomes available, people will need to use masks and practice social distancing measures for some time.How many COVID-19 vaccines are under development? Multiple COVID-19 vaccines are under development. As of October 13, 2020, four vaccines have begun large-scale (phase 3) clinical trials in the United States. For additional information, please see the WHO website at https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/covid-19-vaccines?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIroXC2uvD7AIVNgiICR3pCg1tEAAYAiAAEgJi7_D_BwEWhen will NJ receive the COVID-19 vaccine(s)? At first, there may be limited supply of COVID-19 vaccine(s). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and OperationWarp Speed (OWS) will work together to get those first vaccines doses out once a vaccine is authorized or approved and recommended. New Jersey will receive an allocation of vaccine from the federal government when thevaccine is authorized or approved. When a safe and effective vaccine(s) is available, it will be distributed in a manner that is fair, ethical, transparent and timely for New Jerseyans.CURRENT AS OF December 1, 2020 SOURCE: COVID-19 Vaccine Healthcare Provider Frequently Asked Questions, December 1, 2020 and CDC Frequently asked questions about vaccination 42 Preliminary, pre-decisional, and deliberative. Based on input provided by State agency leaders and staff, to date, and subject to change. Content is descriptive only and is not meant to constitute legal, clinical, or policy advice.COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions (2/4) Who is likely to be among the first to receive the vaccine? Final decisions are being made about use of initially available limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines. These decisions will be informed by the proven efficacy of the vaccines coming out of Phase 3 trails; recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies. The CDC has provided guidance to states that populations of focus for initial COVID-19 vaccination may include: Healthcare personnel likely to be exposed to or treat people with COVID-19. Long-term care residentsPeople at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, including those with underlying medical conditions and people 65 years of age and older Other essential workers Plans will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly once the amount of vaccine coming to New Jersey is known. How many shots of COVID vaccine will be needed? Three clinical trials in the United States use two shots. The other COVID-19 vaccine uses one shot.Who is paying for COVID-19 vaccine?According to the CDC, \"Vaccine doses purchased with U.S. taxpayer dollars will be given to the American people at no cost. However, vaccination providers will be able to charge an administration fee for giving the shot to someone. Vaccine providers can get this fee reimbursed by the patient's public or private insurance company or, for uninsuredpatients, by the Health Resources and Services Administration's Provider Relief Fund.\" https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.htmlDo I need to wear a mask when I receive a COVID-19 vaccine? Yes. CDC recommendsthat during the pandemicpeople wear a maskthat covers theirnose and mouth whenin contact with others outside your household, when in healthcare facilities, and whenreceiving any vaccine, including a COVID-19 vaccine. Anyone who has trouble breathing or is unable to remove a mask without assistance should not wear a mask.For more information, visitconsiderations for wearing masks.https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.htmlIs this a \"live\" virus vaccine? There are different types of vaccines being tested, but we will have to wait for results before seeing which vaccines will beavailable. For detailed information about the various kinds of vaccines, visit https://www.chop.edu/centers-programs/vaccine-education-center/makingvaccines/prevent-covid.Can mRNA vaccines change the DNA Of a person? An mRNA vaccine causes cells to make viral proteins, in this case it is making proteins found in the SARS-CoV-2 virus which is the virus that causes COVID-19. When the proteins are made, they are released from the cell and cells from the immune system recognize them as foreign and attack them, creating an immune response. Since mRNA is active only in a cell's cytoplasm and DNA is located in the nucleus, mRNA vaccines do not operate in the same part of the cell where DNA is located. The mRNA would not change a person's DNA.

The safety of COVID-19 vaccines is a top priority. Currently, clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in many thousands of study participants to generate scientific data and other information for the FDA to determine their safety and effectiveness. These clinical trials are being conducted according to rigorous safety standards. For detailed information, visithttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.htmlWhat are clinical trials? I am concerned that this vaccine was made too quickly and did not undergo enough testing as other vaccines. Clinical trials are research studies performed in people that are aimed at evaluating a medical, surgical, or behavioral intervention. They are the primary way that researchers find out if a new treatment, like a new drug, vaccine, or medical device is safe and effective in people. Currently, clinical trials are evaluating investigational COVID-19 vaccines in many thousands of study participants to generatescientific data and other information for the FDA to determine their safety and effectiveness. These clinical trials are being conducted according to rigorous standards set forth by the FDA. For detailed information, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.htmlHow can I sign up for a clinical trial? Information on how to volunteer for a COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial is available on the National Institute of Health website, https://www.niaid.nih.gov/clinical-trials/covid-19-clinical-trialsIs the COVID-19 vaccine safe for pregnant women? Breastfeeding women? In early clinical trials for various COVID-19 vaccines, only non-pregnant adults participated. For this reason, the vaccine willnot be available for use in pregnant women when it first becomes available. However, clinical trials continue to expand those recruited to participate. Based on data from the expanded clinical trials, groups recommended to receive the vaccines could change in the future.Can children get the COVID-19 vaccine? In early clinical trials for various COVID-19 vaccines, only non-pregnant adults participated. For this reason, the vaccine willnot be available for use in children when it first becomes available. The groups recommended to receive the vaccines could change in the future.Vaccine Availability What should I do to protect myself since the COVID vaccine is not available? You should cover your mouth and nose with a mask when around others, avoid close contact with people who are sick, stay 6 feet away from others, avoid crowds, and wash your hands often. Get more information about these and other steps you can take toprotect yourself and others from COVID-19.Will the vaccine be available to everyone in New Jersey? Final decisions are being made about use of initially available limited supplies of COVID-19 vaccines. These decisions will be informed by the proven efficacy of the vaccines coming out of Phase 3 trails; recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other federal agencies.

Content is descriptive only and is not meant to constitute legal, clinical, or policy advice.COVID-19 Vaccine Frequently Asked Questions (4/4) If I had COVID-19 antibody serology done and have antibodies, do I still need to get vaccinated? There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again; this is called natural immunity. Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this.
