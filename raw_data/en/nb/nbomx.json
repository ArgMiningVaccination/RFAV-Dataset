San Francisco , similar to the rest of California, the U.S., and the world , is in a rapidly changing e nvironment with respect to COVI D-19. The following are the latest changes and updates in our COVID -related operations ; we are continually assessing these policies and practices : SAFETY 1. COVID -19 -Returning Safely Together4 Mandatory Staff Vaccinations As of Friday, October 1st, all ZSFG staff were required to be vaccinated in order to come to work on campus. This decision was made by our San Francisco Health Officer to ensure the safety of our city, especially in high -risk ar eas such as hospitals. Following implementation of the vaccine mandate, 95% (3,457 of 3,630 total staff) of the DPH ZSFG workforce has completed their vaccination series. Of the 3,630 total staff, 3,457 staff have reported completing a vaccination series o 3,265 staff (90% of all ZSFG staff) have completed a vaccination series wi thout entry errors o 192 staff (5% of all ZSFG staff) have reported completing a vaccination series, but need a correction in their entry (either a document didn't upload, or they en tered an invalid date like 12/20/1900) o 81 (2%) staff unvaccinated o 16 (1%) s taff partially vaccinated o 77 (2%) staff requested medical and/or religious exemptions, with 66 requests still pending 76 (2%) staff with data still unentered The vaccine mandate sparked a collaborative partnership among ZSFG leadership, UCSF, DPH Human R esources, and the leadersh ip of SEIU Local 1021. On Wednesday, September 29th, Local 1021 hosted a forum for its members to hear Dr. Andre Campbell, Dr. Susan Ehrlich, and others speak about the importance of vaccination . Over 100 people attended the forum which covered many themes : why vaccinations protect us, our colleagues, friends and families , and the importance of continuing our work at ZSFG. Mostly importantly it reminded everyone to have respect and compassion for one another during this difficult t ime. Our deepest gratitude for all who participated in the forum - representing SEIU, DPH, UCSF Laguna Honda Hospital and ZSFG: Dr. Andre Campbell, Dr. Susan Ehrlich, Andrea Turner, Brent Andrew , Luenna Kim, and Nebyat Negaci. A special thank you to Jason Klum, Kristin Har dy and Theresa Rutherford for organizing and leading and incredible forum ! Vendor COVID -19 Vaccination Requirement As of September 30, all supplier s, vendors , and contractors entering ZSFG buildings must be fully vaccinated against COVID -19. On August 24, 2021, San Francisco updated Health Order no. C19 -07y to include a vaccination mandate for all personnel, including suppliers and vendors who physically enter ZSFG. To ensure compliance with this new policy, ZSFG is requiring that vendor s enroll in our v endor credentialing system, Vendormate, or have a yellow \"Contractor badge\" issued by ZSFG. Furthermore, vendors will need to continue following ZSFG's masking guidance and self -screen for COVID -19 symptoms before arriving on campus. COV ID-19 Standards for Students, Instructors and Faculty On September 23rd, ZSFG adopted additional standards for students, instructors and faculty assigned to ZSFG to mitigate the risk of COVID -19 transmission on campus. These guidelines apply for all school s, oth er than UCSF, with placements on ZSFG's campus. UCSF and ZSFG are aligned in standards and processes. 5 Below are some of the key additional standards: ZSFG will continue to have decreased availability for student placements and students will not b e assi gned to patients diagnosed with or suspected to have COVID -19. Schools are responsible for implementing symptom screening processes for students, instructors, and faculty. Serial testing as well as testing within 24 hours of symptom onset will be imp lement ed. Within 24 hours of notification of a positive test result, the school will complete the ZSFG Academic Partner Preliminary Contact Investigation Worksheet . All students, instructors, and faculty placed at ZSFG must be fully vaccinated. Many than ks to ZSFG's vendors, suppliers, students, instructors, and faculty for complying with our new requirements to ensure the health and safety of our staff and patients! COVID -19 Booster Vaccines As of Wednesday, September 29th, COVID -19 booster shots were m ade available to ZSFG staff based on the CDC and SFDPH Vaccination Branch's guidance . All staff who received the Pfizer vaccine at least six months ago, received emails from SFDPH notifying them that they are eligible to rece ive the COVID -19 Pfizer booster shot. The COVID -19 vaccine clinic is open Monday -Saturday and has been providing Pfizer booster shots to approximately 160 -70 staff/day. From October 4, 2021 to October 15, 2021, OHS has administered 1 ,773 doses of the Pfizer booster vaccine to employees , and our Urgent Care Clinic has administered 4,863 booster vaccines to patients since August 7th, when they were initially approved for immunocompromised individuals . OHS is also prepared to start offering Moderna and J ohnson & Johnson booster vaccines to staff once they have been approved. Many thanks to Lukejohn Day, Chief Medical Officer, for his continued support during the vaccination efforts. 2021 Flu Vaccinations As of Monday, September 27th, ZSFG initiated ou r flu vaccine campaign. OHS set up a drop -in flu vaccination clinic at the back of the cafeteria Monday through Saturday, 7:30am -4:00pm. Flu champions also floated to different areas throughout the hospital to provide vaccinations to various departments. In addition to ZSG's vaccination effor ts, UCSF Occupational Health Services began offering flu shots to their staff as well. Many thanks to our OHS team for leading our flu vaccination 2021 campaign! Many thanks to all our staff for their incredible work throughout and beyond the pandemic, a s well as their unwavering dedication to one anothe r, our patients and community! On Wednesday, September 29th, Community Care Licensing (CCL), a unit under the California Department of Social Services , arrived on campus to conduct an unannounced annu al survey of the Residential Care Facility for the Elderly (RCFE) . During their one -day survey, they toured the facility, including medication and storage rooms , and reviewed infection control practices . In review of these protocols, they assessed staff tr aining and policies, personal protective equipment inventory, quarantine and isolation strategies, signage , and social distancing of residents in communal areas. The surveyors cited zero deficiencies! Following the survey, the RCFE team pulled together f inal documents and submitted them on Monday, October 4th. The survey team was impressed with the implemented COVID -19 protocols and overall preparedness and organization of requested items during the survey . Congratulations to the entire RCFE team and many thanks to Linda Sims and Adela Morales for leading this very successful survey! QUALITY2. Annual Residential Care Facility for the Elderly Survey6 September 15th to October 15th was National Hispanic and Latino/a/x Heritage Month ! This is an important celebration for ZSFG for many reasons - our campus is in the heart of the Mission, a traditionally Hispanic and Latino/a/x community; 35% of our patients and 15% of our DPH staff are Hispanic and Latino/a/x ; and during the pandemic we' ve seen striking inequities beset our Hispanic and Latino/a/x patients and communi ty. E specially e arly in the pandemic, it was shocking to see 80% of our hospitalized COVID -positive patients were Hispanic and Latino/a/x , even though they represented only 1 5% of San Francisco's population. In response , our physician leaders took immedi ate action. O ur Division of HIV, Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine, led by Dr. Diane Havlir and Carmen , quickly mobilized the Unidos en Salud study to work with the com munity by bringing testing and other resources to the Mission. The pandemic highli ghted many challenges in the community, including the lack of access, linguistic -appropriate information, multi -generational home arrangements, high rates of health dispariti es, underlying health issues, low wages, and food insecurity. Dr Alicia Fernandez, the Director of the UCSF Latinx Center of Excellence, has devoted her research to the study of health inequities and their impact, and used this work to educate the communit y about the pandemic. Finally, Dr. Antonio Gomez, the first person to be vaccinate d in San Francisco and the Medical Director of Critical Care at ZSFG, was on the front lines, caring for the most ill of the 1 ,100 patients with COVID -19 on campus . At ZSFG and throughout DPH, our partnership with the Latino Task Force and its constituent group of community -based organizations came together in many ways to support the Mission community. Our efforts over the past year and a half have been a great launching pad for longer -term work: eliminating health disparities and supporting wellness. ZSFG continues to honor our staff, community leaders and champions who are at the forefront of social change. We see, value, and integrity in each person carrying forward ZSFG's goals to advance equity in our communities. Many thanks to the ZSFG, UCSF and DP H Hispanic and Latino/a/x leaders and staff who are dedicated to serving and advancing health equity in our community ! ZSFG's Social Medicine Program was selected to receive the Distinguished Program Award from the Social Emerge ncy Medicine section of the American College o f Emergency Physicians ! This award recognizes a program that has demonstrated an outstanding commitment to advancing the field of Social Emergency Medicine. Over the past year, even throughout the pandemic, the Social Medicine Team achieved many major accomplishments, including the development of a social medicine website, a partnership with the Epic team to develop a Social Medicine documentation dashboard and the initiation of its integration with Mental Health SF and the SFHN in partnership with the Office of Coordinated Care, Care Coordination and Transitions Management team. Due to our team's many wonderful achievements over the past year and significant community service, they are incredibly deserving of this award. Congratulat ions and many thanks to Jenna Bilinski, Hemal Ka nzaria, Jack Chase, Sandra Hall, Kenneth Hill and the rest of the Social Medicine team for all that you do! EQUITY 3. Celebrating our Hispanic and Latino/a/x Community DEVELOPING OUR PEOPLE4. American College of Emergency Medicine -Social Medicine Distinguished Programs Award7 ZSFG Nursing is working on the following initiatives to improve patient safety and support the personal development of our staff. Decreasing Falls with Injury ZSFG Nursing is in the process of reframing falls with injury mitigation strategies. Upon anal yzing ZSFG's falls data for 2021 (chart below) , the team discovered that over 50% off all falls occurred in five units and over 50% of all injuries , second to falls , occurred in four out of those five units. In response to these findings, Nursing is actively revitalizing the Falls Prevention Program with the introduction of a Falls Leadership Team. This team will include staff from Nursing and Quality Management and will work directly with these five units . More specifically, they plan to actively eng age with each unit's frontline staff and leadership through the utilization of A3 Thinking, DMS Hudd le Boards and performance improvement methodologies to prevent patient injuries. Behavioral Emergency Response Team Expansion Last month t he Behavioral Emergency Response Team (BERT) expanded their services to cover Ambulatory and Specialty Clinics at Z SFG. BERT is a rapid response team of psychiatrically trained healthcare professionals that respond to any perceived or impending behavioral emergencies in various medical settings on campus. By applying their professional expertise and training through th e Crisis Prevention Institute (CPI), BERT utilize s de-escalation strategies to prevent and mitigate aggression in patients undergoing a behav ioral health crisis. On average there are 13 BERT activations per month. BERT nurses follow -up on patients and staf f after each BERT activation to debrief , reevaluate the situation and reassess the patient's condition. Additionally , BERT perform s daily rou nds on various departments throughout ZSFG to identify patients who may benefit from adjunctive support and minimiz e patients' behavioral cris es through early detection and intervention. During these rounds, BERT conducts an average of 26 consultations per month to support our patients in crisis. Nurse Leader Mentor ship Program Nursing Administration is launching t he Nurse Leader Mentor ship Program later this year. This mentor ship program will partner nurses who are transitioning into leadership roles with other experienced nurse leaders throughout the organization. This program aims to provide a robust and comprehe nsive orientation for new Nurse Managers and Supervisors through collegiality , teamwork, education and training, socializat ion, and role modeling. Nursing Administration and Workforce Development are creating this program using nursing professional develo pment best practices. A pilot program is set to begin later this Fall.

Through their performance improvement work, BCMA compliance at ZSFG has increased from 81% to 87% since its inception and monthly unreconciled controlled substances have de creased by 96% since January 2021. This past month, ZSFG celebrated many healthcare recognitions in honor of our staff and the incredible work they do every single day! Food and Nutrition Services Week October 4 -10 was Healthcare Foodservice Workers' Week ; a great time to honor our incredible Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) team ! FNS is a department of 130 employees made up of food servi ce workers, diet office staff, cooks, supervisors, managers, support staff, dietitians, and di etetic technicians. This well-integrated interdisciplinary team works together to make delicious and nutritious food for our community , serving approximately 1 ,200 patient meals and 1,500 cafe meals every day, operating out of two kitchens in Buildings 5 and 25 with approximately 26,000 square feet of space. Over the years, FNS has developed focus and goals around sustainable purchasing, prioritizing food that's p roduced locally and grown in an environmentally friendly way. FNS sources food that raises animals humanely, chooses vendors that value their workforce, and selects food that is nutritious. For example, 75% of the meat FNS purchases is raised with no antib iotics, and all its eggs are cage -free. FNS also consistently promotes cultural events in the cafeteria so thoughtfully and beautifully, including the Hispanic Heritage celebration, Juneteenth, Pride, Filipino American History Month, and Lunar New Year. Finally , the team is looking forward to a cafe renovation project that will create a seating and serving space that is modern and truly honors the community it serves. National Supply Chains Week Since the beginning of the pandemic , the value of frontli ne workers has become abundantly clear. Our l ess recognized but incredibly essential partners, Materials Management (MM) and Central Processing (CPD) , work tirelessly 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year , to ensure supplies a nd materials are orde red, stocked and available for our clinical partners and patients. October 3 -9 was National Supply Chain Week and the perfect way to honor and celebrate our fantastic staff ! With COVID -19 came sudden supply disruptions, unprecedented demand for supplies , and staffing challenges. Over the past 18 months Materials Management has stepped into new roles to support the citywide pandemic response. It was , and continues to be , an incredibly stressful and demanding environment, but neverthe less, Materials Manag ement/CPD steps up in laudable ways. Supply Chain/Materials Management Week is time to recognize the critical role that MM/CPD plays in the daily operations in a healthcare setting.
