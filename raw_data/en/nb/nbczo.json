Many patients these days are attracted to Integrative Medicine, Eastern Medicine, and other alternatives to Western Medicine. Western Medicine is called Allopathic Medicine. Osteopathic Medicine is very similar now to Allopathic Medicine. Allopathic and Osteopathic are based on results of scientific empirical studies that are subjected to rigorous statistical examinations. We are made of a physical body and a mind. The mind makes us like, dislike, judge and evaluate. The Allopathic and Osteopathic ways are scientific and attempt to be based on facts. On the other hand, many alternative approaches base themselves on opinions, philosophies and tradition. In my view both approaches have erred. Western Medicine traditionally has attempted to heal the physical body, forgetting to a large extent to comfort the mind. Alternative Medicine has learned to attract patients with massage, relaxation, meditation, pleasant aromas, beautiful healing clinics that are very appealing to the eyes and offers what it has called therapies from Nature and an atmosphere very seductive to the soul. Sadly, Western Medicine tries to give the raw gift without the attractive wrapping, without the seductive atmosphere of Alternative Medicine. Many of us physicians seem austere to patients and many of us have developed an ego after our extensive and very hard studies, an ego which patients dislike. Both Allopathic and \" Alternative \" healing ways should combine the trust of Science and the comfort of the soul and lead to the same trustworthy and comforting paradigm. This will give us a holistic approach to healing. P. "}
