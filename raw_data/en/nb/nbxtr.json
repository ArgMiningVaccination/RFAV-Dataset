She was a senior statistician at Becton, Dickinson and Company from 2006-2007, came to the Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Michigan in 2007 as a Statistician Lead, and joined the Department of Biostatistics in 2011 as a faculty member. She has collaborated with researchers in disease areas, including Cancer, Cardiology, Pathology, Cirrhosis, Neurology, Endocrinology, Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Infectious Diseases, Diabetes, and Surgery. She has strived to develop, translate and promote the use of innovative statistical methodologies in biomedical research. As a Co-Investigator on numerous NIH and foundation-funded studies, she has adapted methodologies, including Bayesian data analysis, causal inference, generalized linear models, longitudinal data analysis, multivariate analysis, survival data analysis and machine learning methods, in response to the unique needs of individual studies and objectives without compromising the integrity of the research and results. - PhD, Statistics, University of Iowa, 2006 - M.A., Statistics, University of Iowa, 2004 B.S., Business and Economics, Capital University of - Economics and Business, Beijing, 1999 Vaccine Safety Study: Effective and rigorous analyses of post-vaccination adverse events is critical to ensure the safety of vaccines. In this study, we will develop a series of methods for vaccine safety surveillance while incorporating adverse event ontology. The current interests focus on studying safety of COVID19 vaccine using data from the national vaccine safety surveillance program, electronic health record data and insurance claims data. This research is funded through my R01 grant from the National Institutes of Health entitled \"Incorporation of multilevel ontologies of adverse events and vaccines for vaccine safety surveillance \" Safety of Immunotherapy in Patients with Cancer and Autoimmune Disease Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are arguably the most important development in cancer therapy over the past decade, reshaping many of the previous standard-of-care approaches. However, a very large group of patients with autoimmune disease (AID) are not being helped because we do not fully understand the toxicity immunotherapy might present to this group. This study will objectively estimate the safety and efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced cancer and concomitant AID, using a large, nationally representative dataset.
