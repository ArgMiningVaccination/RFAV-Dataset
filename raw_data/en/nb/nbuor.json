The concept is unproven and dangerous. Yet it is being promoted relentlessly. Currently, I get > 12 million websites when I google 'homeopathic vaccination', and there are hundreds of dangerously misleading books and newspaper articles on the subject. One study that I therefore always wanted to conduct was a trial comparing homeopathic 'vaccines' to placebo in terms of immunological response in human volunteers. Somehow, I never managed to get it going. Thus, I was delighted when, a few weeks ago, I received an article for peer-review (I hope I am allowed to disclose this fact here); it was almost exactly the trial I had dreamt of doing one day: [the first ever study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=antibody+response+of+homeopathic+and+conventional+vaccines) to test whether there is an antibody response to homeopathic vaccines. Now I am even more delighted to see that it has been published. Its aim was to compare the antibody response of homeopathic and conventional vaccines and placebo in young adults. The authors hypothesized that there would be no significant difference between homeopathic vaccines and placebo, while there would be a significant increase in antibodies in those received conventional vaccines. A placebo-controlled, double-blind RCT was conducted where 150 university students who had received childhood vaccinations were assigned to diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, mumps, measles homeopathic vaccine, placebo, or conventional diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus (Tdap) and mumps, measles, rubella (MMR) vaccines. The primary outcome was a two-fold increase in antibodies from baseline following vaccination as measured by ELISA. Participants, investigators, study coordinator, data blood drawers, laboratory technician, and data analyst were blinded. None of the participants in either the homeopathic vaccine or the placebo group showed a two-fold response to any of the antigens. In contrast, of those vaccinated with Tdap, 68% (33/48) had a two-fold toxoid, 88% (42/48) to tetanus, and 35% (17/48) of those vaccinated with MMR had a response to measles or mumps antigens (p < 0.001 for each comparison of conventional vaccine to homeopathic vaccine or to placebo). There was a significant increase in geometric mean titres of antibody from baseline for conventional vaccine antigens (p < 0.001 for each), but none for the response to homeopathic antigens or placebo. The authors concluded that homeopathic vaccines do not evoke antibody responses and produce a response that is similar to placebo. In contrast, conventional vaccines provide a robust antibody response in the majority of those vaccinated. I think this is in every respect an excellent trial. It should once and for all get rid of what is arguably the homeopathy-cult's most dangerous idea, namely that highly diluted homeopathic remedies can protect humans against infectious diseases. On this blog, I [once called it](https://edzardernst.com/2017/07/recommending-homeoprophylaxis-is-unethical-irresponsible-and-possibly-even-criminal/) 'a danger for both the public and the individual who might believe in it ... promoting HP is unethical, irresponsible and possibly even criminal.' I said it 'should' get rid of this nonsense, but will it? As homeopaths have, for now 200 years, showed themselves utterly impervious to evidence, I for one am not holding my breath. Yet, thanks to this excellent study, we can, when confronted with the notion of homeopathic vaccinations, henceforth point out that it is not just totally implausible but that, in addition, it has also been experimentally shown to be false.
