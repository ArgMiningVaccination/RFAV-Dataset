PLOS ONEnoted in March 2016 that the authors had contacted the journal regarding an error in some of the exposure levels reported in the study, which journal staff were \"looking into.\" In December 2016, the journal told the authors it was going to retract the paper. Now, more than one year later, it finally has. Researchers are retracting a 2016 PNASpaper that described a way to create gasoline-like fuels directly from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Senior author Frederick MacDonnell, a professor at the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), told us he originally thought his team had made a preliminary breakthrough that might \"solve the world's energy problems.\" Instead, he said: A business consultant allegedly plagiarized an article on leadership written by a former U.S. Air Force officer who is now a high-ranking official in the Department of Homeland Security. Thomas Mattus, president and founder of a business training firm, submitted a paper to the Project Management Institute (PMI) Global Congress in Vancouver, Canada. The paper, on \"transformational leadership,\" defined the term and its relevance to the world of project management. PMI accepted \"Transformational leadership for project managers\" as a conference paper and posted it in 2012 to the PMI website. But a researcher at the U.S. Naval War College alleges that Mattus plagiarized the paper from an article written in 2001 by Mark Homrig, who was a colonel in the Air Force at the time. Homrig is now a section chief at Homeland Security. It's unclear why \"Profiling taste-motivated segments\" is being retracted (we asked the journal, but haven't immediately heard back); some potential issues were flagged in March by Nick Brown, a PhD student who has devoted hundreds of hours to analyzing Wansink's work (and forwarded us the email from Appetite confirming the upcoming retraction). What Caught Our Attention: We've written about the controversy surrounding a commonly used tool to measure whether patients are sticking to their drug regimen, known as the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8). It can cost thousands of dollars \u2014 and using it without payment/permission earns researchers a call from a collector, who has used legal threats to compel multiple teams to withdraw their papers (a phenomenon we wrote about in Science). The creator of the tool argues it's copyrighted, and demanding fees ensures researchers use it properly, which avoids putting patients at risk. We've found a notice (paywalled, tsk-tsk) that reveals another group of authors used the tool without permission and, according to the notice, \"incorrectly.\" A university investigation has found falsified data in a 2011 paper about the side effects of a virus commonly used in gene therapy. The authors are retracting the paper, but one co-author told Retraction Watch they stand by their main conclusions. According to Roland Herzog, a professor at the University of Florida (UF) College of Medicine and a co-author of the paper, the falsified data were related to a minor part of the paper. "}
