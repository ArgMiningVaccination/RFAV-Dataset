Read on for more information about treating detox symptoms at home and 5 opiate withdrawal home remedies that can help you. Table of Contents: 5 Opiate Withdrawals Home Remedies 1. Relief for fever, sweating, muscle pains, and chills Some people only experience extreme heat or cold while others experience both. Consider wearing thin layers of clothing that can easily be added or taken away as needed to maintain a comfortable body temperature. Fever and pain can be managed with NSAIDS like [acetaminophen](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-362/acetaminophen-oral/details) or ibuprofen. Cool compresses can also be used to help reduce fevers. 2. Relief for nausea and diarrhea Over the counter medications can help manage these symptoms. Medications like Antivert, Bonine, or Dramamine help soothe nausea while Imodium can relieve diarrhea. Those looking for more natural remedies for nausea may find ginger ale or ginger tea to relieve their symptoms. Taking the same precautions in your diet as you would when dealing with a stomach flu can also help lessen discomfort. Eating several small meals a day made up of foods gentle on your stomach can help avoid stomach upset. The \"BRAT\" (Bananas, Rice, Applesauce, and Toast) diet is ideal for these situations. 3. Avoiding dehydration Dehydration is one of the most dangerous aspects of detox and is the issue that most often leads to people being hospitalized during withdrawal. [Dehydration](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/dehydration/#:~:text=Dehydration%20means%20your%20body%20loses,and%20become%20a%20serious%20problem.) can lead to heart issues if it's not treated properly. Nausea and diarrhea contribute to dehydration, and some people can also find food and drink to be repulsive during withdrawal, making treatment challenging. Pedialyte or other electrolyte solutions can help fight dehydration, and you should drink as many hydrating fluids as you can during detox. 4. Dealing with cravings Preparing for detox in advance can help you put safeguards in place for when you must fight the urge to quit the detox process. Consider techniques such as: - Writing a list of reasons why you want to get sober that you can refer back to when you need it - Recognizing negative thought patterns and thoughtfully countering them with reality - Using distraction techniques to engage in a healthy alternative to using opioids, like listening to music or going on a walk 5. Natural and herbal remedies Some people prefer natural remedies and supplements to [ over-the-counter](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/buying-using-medicine-safely/understanding-over-counter-medicines#:~:text=Over%2Dthe%2Dcounter%20medicine%20is,by%20your%20health%20care%20professional.) or prescription drugs. It's important to remember that natural supplements and herbs are not fully regulated by the FDA, so be careful if someone seems to be selling an idea too good to be true. You should also make sure that an herb or supplement will not react negatively with any other health condition or medications you are taking. Natural opiate withdrawals home remedies include: - Melatonin: This sleep hormone can help combat insomnia and restlessness associated with opiate detox. - St. John's Wort: This herb can help reduce tremors and relieve feelings of heaviness in limbs. In addition to these, a number of treatments common to Chinese herbal medicine have [shown in studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20014908/) to be very effective in helping symptoms. These opiate withdrawals home remedies include: - Tai-Kang-Ning: A Chinese herb thought to help moderate to severe heroin withdrawal - U'finer: A Chinese herbal blend to help repair brain damage caused by opiate use - Acupuncture may also help reduce withdrawal symptoms Why medically managed detox is safe and effective Detoxing under the supervision of a healthcare professional means that an expert can evaluate your risk factors and plan accordingly to keep you as healthy and comfortable as possible. If you have other health conditions or take other prescription medications, you are much more likely to have complications in detox than an otherwise healthy person. Doctors can prescribe medications that will reduce withdrawal symptoms and shorten the length of time it takes for your body to fully detox. The better treatment you get for [withdrawal symptoms](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000949.htm), the less likely it is your withdrawal will cause long-term health complications. Medically-managed withdrawal also allows you to focus on recovery, rather than stressing about which over-the-counter medication combinations are safe.
