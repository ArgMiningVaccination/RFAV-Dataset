Learn how injection therapy can heal the body naturally while providing patients with an increased quality of life.", "sitename": "Billings Gazette", "date": "2023-06-23", "cleaned_text": "No two bodies are alike. Once you are injured or in pain, no two bodies heal exactly the same way. For some, depending on the scope and severity of the injury, surgery is inevitable. For others, however, natural regenerative injection therapies are treatment pathways that can restore range of movement and reduce pain without the need for surgery, according to Autumn Dugas, a licensed naturopathic physician at Yellowstone Naturopathic Clinic. As a result, recovery time is greatly reduced. The Yellowstone Naturopathic Clinic, which serves southeastern Montana, northern Wyoming and the western Dakotas, provides two types of regenerative treatment - platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy and prolotherapy, both of which are injection treatments that target the musculoskeletal system. Both methods amplify the number of reparative cells in the body and accelerate the natural growth factors the body uses to heal tissue in injured and stressed ligaments, joints, muscles and tendons. The differences between the two are the substances that are injected into the targeted area and the type of injury. People are also reading... PRP therapy is considered more of a heavy hitter as far as treatment goes. In PRP, the platelets contain a wealth of proteins and growth factors that can accelerate the regeneration process and an inflammatory response in the affected area. PRP is effective to treat osteoarthritis, rotator cuff tears, and arthritis in the knees, hips, lower back and shoulders, esthetics for aging, scarring, hair loss, urinary incontinence, vaginal dryness and erectile dysfunction. During treatment, blood is drawn from a patient, which is run through a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets. The concentrated solution is injected back into the injured location. Prolotherapy injections include a combination of an anesthetic and dextrose (sugar water) that when administered, cause an inflammatory response that stimulates the joint's regrowth. \"The human body is an incredible machine,\" said Dugas. \"Educating individuals on how powerful their bodies really are and the healing powers they hold within can be a very eye-opening experience for them.\" Yellowstone offers patients a complementary, 15-minute phone consultation or in person consultation with a naturopathic physician to discuss therapies. Individuals do not need to be established clinic patients to schedule regenerative therapy treatments. A one-hour, health screening visit is scheduled for all new areas of treatment. The screening visit is individualized. The doctor and patient will identify through a comprehensive orthopedic exam, review of recent X-rays, MRIs and bloodwork if other testing is necessary. After the screening process is completed, the patient is scheduled for the treatment. The treatment times vary by the area being treated. Patients coming from a distance can coordinate part of this process on the phone so you can come in just one time for the injection. These two types of injection therapies will cause an inflammatory response typically for three to five days followed by healing. You will notice increased mobility within the first month to six weeks. For the best results a patient can expect to receive one to three treatments, each treatment being administered six to eight weeks apart, depending upon the extent of the injury.
