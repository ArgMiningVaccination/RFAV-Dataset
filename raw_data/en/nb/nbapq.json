It's the state of hyper-focused tranquil meditation, which sounds like an oxymoron but is a similar state observed in master musicians and meditators like the Tibetan monks. | | 12hz - 38hz - Likely our most common waking brainwave state, Beta waves are related to conscious thinking, learning and concentration. This is the state we are in while studying and is also associated with anxiety and stress. Beta waves serve a very important function for the body - to help us learn and understand, but in excess we can get stuck in this brainwave state and experience anxiety and an overly stressed system in fight or flight mode which can erode creativity and energy. (Herrman December 1997). | | 8hz - 12hz - The next step down in brain wave activity is the Alpha state, this is our typical relaxation state where we relax, recharge and reflect in an awake state, it's winding down at the end of the day before bedtime. This state has an increase of serotonin production and is associated with relaxed focus, it's the beginning of access to an unconscious mind. | | 4h-8hz - Theta state is associated with deep meditation and relaxation or light sleep including the REM cycle of sleep. Great inspiration and profound learning can take place in this state of brain activity including healing and a general experience of 'oneness.' Meditation, yoga and acupuncture can all help a person drop down into this theta state and this is where profound healing and in some cases mystical type experiences can be accessed. Theta waves may also be present during times of emotional distress like frustration and disappointment and in degenerative brain disorders (Cabolu, M., 2016). | | 0.5hz-4hz - Associated with deep, dreamless sleep Delta waves are the lowest in frequency but highest in amplitude. The brainwave state helps us access the unconscious mind and universal consciousness, release of the human growth hormone and is also associated and necessary for deep healing which occurs during that deep sleep phase, it's also the dominant pattern in infants and persons with serious organic brain disease. | | Dr. Kim Peirano, DACM, LAc is a practicing Acupuncturist in San Rafael, CA with her practice Dr. Kim Peirano, DACM, LAc is the Owner and Acupuncturist at Lion's Heart Wellness, the San Francisco Bay Area and Marin's #1 Cosmetic Would Love to Have You Visit Soon!
