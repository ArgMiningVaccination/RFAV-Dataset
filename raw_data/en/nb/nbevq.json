This review paper aims to scheme out the social and the economic effects of Covid19 Pandemic, and the importance of the healthcare infrastructure in the response to the rapid spread of pandemics.In this paper the roles of 3D printing, artificial intelligence integrated in different technologies in the urgent response to pandemic like Covid-19 is reviewed. In addition, the very wide research area of vaccines and treatments are covered, reviewing the most promising candidate drugs and vaccines that entered the clinical trials to date. In coorperation with several other disciplines, biomedical engineering with its wide range of application areas played an important role in the propagation of the urgent Sciences Journal}, issn = {2645-9000}, address = {}, publisher = {Izmir of Democracy}, year = {2020}, volume = {3}, number = {1}, pages = {1 - 16}, doi = {10.38061/idunas.754344}, title = {Role of Biomedical Engineering during COVID-19 Pandemic}, key = {cite}, author = {ahada, Ala and Tekindor, Aye Nur and Abbad, Mohammad Bilal Malluh, Malluh, M.
