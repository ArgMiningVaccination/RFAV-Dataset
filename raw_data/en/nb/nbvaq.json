While such a report cannot cover all the accomplishments and changes that have occurred over the past two years, it will give you some insight into what has transpired over that time period. The main purpose for the existence of dental schools is to provide an excellent clinical education for students, so that they can perform comprehensive, competent dental care for the public they serve. W e are proud of the knowledge, skills, and inquisitiveness our students acquire and demonstrate during their years with us. The pursuit of excellence is a profession-spanning endeavor. And while we are pleased with the characteristics we ob - serve in our students and the progress of their educational growth, we will never be satisfied with the status quo. Past, and even current, excellence does not assure a continuum in the future of dental education. Like all organizations and institutions, the School of Dentistry must continually refine its vision and identify areas where the level of excellence can be enhanced. Let me assure you that the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry family is committed not only to offering innova - tive, comprehensive educational processes, but also to seek - ing avenues to improve upon the education we offer. W e are also committed to promoting an empowering and uplifting educational environment that incorporates spiritual values and includes extensive clinical experience for our students. Our charge remains to train healthcare professionals who provide high-quality, oral health care that exceeds patients' expectations, while developing and expressing creativity that also advances the dental profession through research and scholarly activity. I hope you enjoy this report.Sincerely, Charles J. Goodacre, SD'71, MSD Dean B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 4OffIcE Of ThE dEAN Charles J. Goodacre, DDS, MSD DeanFacilities upgraded in dental anesthesiology, the advanced education program clinic in endodontics, and the advanced education program clinic in prosthodontics. Creation and revision of several new electronic learning resources during the biennium. Corporate support was received for one of the resources, implant dentistry, so that it could also be provided to students and faculty at other schools in the country. Approximately 11,000 requests were received from students and faculty all over North America. Professional participation The dean maintains membership in 16 dental orga - nizations. In addition, he gave leadership to two of them: During October 2008-2009, he served as president of the American College of Prosthodontists. Beginning in May 2009, he became president of the Academy of Prosthodontics Further professional recognition came in 2008 when the ADEA Gies Foundation presented the dean with its William J. Gies Award for Outstanding Innovation by a Dental Educator. Educational output An innovator in electronic education, Dr. Goodacre, who has noted that the hallmark of dentistry is development of three-dimensional visualization skills, continues to produce sophisticated interactive, navigable, nonlinear electronic education resources for students. The following programs were developed during this biennium: Oral Cancer Screening CD-ROM, in 2008 Electronic Atlas of Human Occlusion and the TMJ, a DVD-ROM completed in 2008 in conjunction with eHuman.com Color and Shade Selection CD-ROM in 2009 Head and Neck Anatomy for Dentistry, the first comprehensive program deliverable over the W eb, was developed in 2009. Completion of two textbook chapters, Chapter 40 in Endodontics, 6 th edition , and Chapter 16 in Endodontics Principles and Practices, 4th edition Research, teaching and lecturing Participation in research added five refereed journal articles in 2009 to the dean's impressive list of publications. The dean participated in introductory courses for under- represented minority students.Office of the Dean Dean Charles Goodacre works as an administrator, educator, professional, researcher, thought leader, and innovator as he oversees Loma Linda University School of Dentistry's expanding programs. Biennium highlights During the 2008-2009 biennium the School's progress can be identified by a series of achievements: Successful re-accreditation of dental, dental hygiene, and advanced education programs with no recommen - dations for change from the Commission on Dental Accreditation site visit team Leasing of new office space for the orthodontics clinic and departmental offices, as well as a new faculty practice facility Incorporation of a surgical implant placement experi - ence into the preclinical implant dentistry course for dental students Addition of cone beam computed tomography interpretation skills and the use of digital implant planning software to the implant dentistry course for dental students Establishment of two endowed professorships, one in endodontics and one in oral and maxillofacial surgery Significant participation (lectures and negotiations) by six LLUSD faculty at the W orld Health Organization meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, in July 2009, to initiate interaction of WHO with faith-based organizationsB I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 5OffIcE Of ThE dEAN The dean's lecturing schedule during 2008 and 2009 took him to the following sites: 2008 University of T exas Health Sciences Center & Ameri - can Dental Association session, San Antonio, T exas Ontario Dental Association, T oronto, Ontario Exploring Excellence Study Club, Eugene, Oregon Indiana University School of Dentistry Graduate Prosthodontics, Indianapolis, Indiana Prosthodontic Residence Program, Fort Gordon, Georgia Pacific Coast Society for Prosthodontics, Kona, HawaiiOrange County (California) Dental Academy Canadian Academy for Restorative Dentistry and Prosthodontics, Vancouver, British ColumbiaSan Gabriel (California) V alley Dental Society American Academy of Implant Dentistry, Loma Linda University W enzhou Medical College, W enzhou, China 2009 Rocky Mountain Dental Convention, Denver, Colorado American Academy of Fixed Prosthodontics and American College of Prosthodontists review course, Chicago, Illinois University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, Minne - apolis, MinnesotaEndodontic Study Club, Diamond Bar, California University of Southern California School of Dentistry, Los Angeles, California W ashington Prosthodontic Society, Seattle, W ashington King Faisal University College of Dentistry's Scientific Symposium, Dammam, Saudi, Arabia University of Maryland Dental School, Baltimore, Maryland Judson Klooster Symposium, Loma Linda University University of Connecticut School of Dental Medicine Prosthodontics, Farmington, Connecticut Sacramento District Dental Society, Sacramento, California Furthermore . . .

The office is specifically charged with the oversight of the School's dental hygiene and dental programs. It fulfills this responsibility by working in concert with University leaders, School administrators, faculty and staff to develop, implement, review and evaluate the academic and clinical programs. The office monitors the academic standing of all School of Dentistry students and oversees matters of registration, enrollment in and withdrawal from courses, management of the various curricula and graduation. It is noteworthy that during this biennium, the School of Dentistry completed a successful site visit of all its accredited programs. The evaluations from the Commission on Dental Accreditation's site visit team were uniformly excellent. Although many administrators and faculty devoted much time and effort to preparing the institutional self-study, special recognition must be given to W . Patrick Naylor, DDS, MPH, MS, associate dean for Advanced Education, coordinator of the advanced education self-studies, T om Rogers, SD'83, MA, director, Faculty Leadership & Development, Dental Education Services, coordinator of the pre-doctoral self-study, and Joni Stephens, DH'69, EdS, MS, professor, Dental Hygiene, coordinator of the dental hygiene self-study.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 7AcAdEmIc AffAIRs Scores returned April 30, 2009, from the Joint Commission on National Dental Examination indicate that for a third consecutive year all the graduating LLUSD dental hygiene students passed their national board exams. Furthermore, the average score of the School's 41 graduating hygiene students was 88.7\u20144.3 points (approaching one standard deviation) above the 84.4 national average. Clinical honors program completion The clinical honors program is designed to provide dental students opportunities to learn and perform more advanced clinical procedures in a given discipline. In addition, the Dental Education honors program is designed to foster interest in an academic dental career in teaching and research. Students accepted into the program do not receive additional clinic points for their advanced learning and must complete all competency clinic requirements. Successful honor students must maintain a class rank in the upper third of their class both academically and clinically. These are the elite dental students in the School of Dentistry. The following students achieved the honor distinction: Class of 2008 Jessica Horricks Dental Education Patricia Ramos Dental Education Jonathan Reth Dental Education Elisa Song Dental Education Christopher Hanson Implant Dentistry Phillip Horsley Implant Dentistry Neal Johnson Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Nathan Latimer Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Bryan Fletcher Pediatric Dentistry Jennifer Clark Periodontics Brian Lin Periodontics Lee Special Oral Porter Maxillofacial Special D4 Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Vincent Drouin Conscious Sedation Sonny Porter Conscious Sedation Julie Catalano Pediatric Dentistry Shaun Flynn Pediatric Dentistry Carl Appleton Dental Education Jonathan Channer Dental Education Dennis Iverson Dental Education Sue Jean Park Dental Education Dennis Simental Dental Education Louis Y ap Dental Education Mark Brown Implant Dentistry Prashant V erma Implant Dentistry Jasper Y ai Implant Dentistry T eacher of the Y ear awards (chosen by students, faculty, and staff ) 2008, 2009: The T eacher of the Y ear Award was established to recognize and honor School of Dentistry faculty members whose accomplishments have made an extraordinary impact on students, peers, and the School family. Each year a full-time faculty member is chosen for this award based on having demonstrated an outstanding reputation as a teacher, and having contributed to the quality of the School, the community and the church. 2008 Robert A. Handysides, SD'93, PG'01, chair, Department of Endodontics, LLU School of Dentistry Student commentsHe is by far one of my favorite instructors. He makes the course more interesting and fun.I can tell he really cares about students and is here to teach because he wants us to learn. He is helpful and, above all, funny.Dr. Handysides may be the best instructor in the School, hands down! 2009 Kenneth R. Wright, Ph.D., assistant professor of Pathology and Human Anatomy, LLU School of Medicine Student comments This course is probably the best organized course I have ever taken. I have never taken Gross Anatomy before and this class makes it fun and moves at a challenging but reasonable pace.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 8His publication list is lengthy, with more than 160 articles in professional journals.

When Tiffany Beale, class of 2013, visited the LLU campus during her senior year at Oakwood University, her undergraduate performance had already prompted scholarship offers at several dental schools. \"Somehow,\" she says, \"none of the schools felt right. Something was missing at those schools. When I came to Loma Linda, the atmosphere, the facilities, and the people felt right.\" She cites the words of admissions officer, Marlise Perry, \"W e want you here because you can contribute to the School.\" With several schools to choose from, Tiffany chose Loma Linda University School of Dentistry. Class profiles The class profiles for students admitted in 2009 indicate a record high of applicants (2,164), and a record high of five men entering the dental hygiene class in 2009. The male/female distribution in the dental class (70/30 percent) places females 10 percent below the national average.

Accepted candidates will enter the only dental school in the nation which includes all three of these components: Required chapel attendance Religion courses Service learning requirements (120 hours for dental students, 75 hours for dental hygiene students). T o be compatible with the school's objectives, student selection seeks evidence of distinctive attributes: Altruism as a focus A desire to grow spiritually, mentally, and ethically Comfortable accommodation to an ethnically diverse campus population Looking at a student profile, the Admissions Committee members want to know . . . Does the student have active involvement with church and community? Has the student been involved in any outreach activities?Has the student had extensive exposure to the dental profession? B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 11SERViCE LEARninG Fred Kasischke, DMin Associate Dean, Admissions and Service Learning Mobile clinic LLUSD's mobile dental clinic visited elementary schools in Redlands and San Bernardino on a weekly basis, where the children enrolled there could receive dental fillings and extractions. In monthly visits to a homeless shelter in Riverside, team members offered similar service to the shelter's adults-only guests. The mobile clinic team also scheduled yearly visits at a dozen other locations, where low-income people were concentrated. For example, four dental students, supervised by Perry Burtch, SD'89, assistant professor, went to the San Bernardino Salvation Army in February 2009. Working in the School's mobile clinic\u2014an RV equipped with two dental chairs, an x-ray station, and sanitizer\u2014the team provided dental care for 16 guests housed at the site. A distinctive segment of David Brodeur's (SD'71, MPA) faculty appointment (assistant professor, Restorative Dentistry) is a twice-weekly trip to the site of a clinic at the School Readiness Program in Thermal, California. Every Tuesday and Thursday five dental seniors join him in a van. Once a week he adds a pediatric resident and two dental hygiene seniors. The clinic is 100 miles away. The trip affords time for discussion of real-life dentistry and opens the students' eyes to a different way of life in dentistry. Dr. Brodeur estimates that 15 to 20 percent of the students have said to him, \"In this setting I have found what I want to do with my life.\" He adds, \"That's what happened to me as well.\" The clinic\u2014five chairs packed into a small room\u2014is a busy place. \"\"We see 18 to 25 patients each day,\" says Dr. Brodeur, \"mostly children, two to fourteen years of age. It's almost exclusively a pediatric practice\u2014lots of fillings and extractions.\" Dr. Brodeur speaks solemnly of the patients. \"It's sad to find children two to three years old needing dental care. Most of their parents (many undocumented) work in the date groves. There's a wide disparity between the owners and workers. These are people without resources.\" Speaking for himself and his teaching colleagues, Dr. Brodeur says, \"We are not here to get rich. We love what we do. We can give students the experience that it takes to run a practice. We have learned from life.\"Service Learning Since 1998, when NASDAD's (National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists) board voted a five-year endowment of $50,000 to support a LLUSD service learning program, service learning has become a prominent part of the curriculum for dental and dental hygiene students and students in the International Dentist Program, where the motto, Service Is Our Calling, has become personified through them. Local sites During the 2008-09 biennium, the service learning program coordinated the departure of approximately 50 students monthly and 60 students weekly to render service at nearby sites. T ypical activity for dental and/or dental hygiene students during the 2008-2009 took them to these sites: Service Learning Sites bi-weekly weekly monthly Lugonia Elementary School DDS Victoria Elementary School DDS Baldyview ROP DDS/DH Thermal School (Mecca) DDS / DH 29 Palms Dental Clinic DH Compassion Clinic DDS/DH Share Ourselves (SOS) DDS Assistance League of Redlands dds/dh SACHS Dental Clinic dds/dh Riverside Presbyterian DDSB I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 12SERViCE LEARninG Clinic With a Heart An annual event, Clinic With a Heart provides a day-long opportunity for service learning.

One of the 2009 stories began at 4 a.m. when eleven homeless men arrived, one walking on crutches. Toting backpacks from their hangout under a nearby bridge, the homelss men joined the long line of waiting patients. As the morning wore on, the men asked to use bathroom facilities. Mary Hartwell, the School's dental clinics manager, gave them directions. Using the facilities in turns, they guarded each others' backpacks. When one of the party emerged, complaining about the absence of paper towels in the bathroom, his buddies chided him, \"Think, man! Y ou don't even have water where you live!\" Upon completion of their dental procedures, the eleven grateful men, ranging in ages from 40 to 75, approached Mary Hartwell again: \"W e want to do something for the School of Dentistry. Could we wash the windows in the School?\" Explaining that their offer could not be implemented, volunteers pressed toothbrushes and toothpaste kits into their hands. International mission trips Facilitating enrollment for international service opportunities, registration became available online in August 2008. At the initial registration, 61 students successfully registered for six mission trips\u2014Bangladesh, Guatemala, Loreto, Mexico, Ukraine; MEND in Pacoima, California; and La Vida Mission in New Mexico\u2014between August 10 and August 16. Moving a dental team overseas requires lots of paper work and myriad communiqu\u00e9s. The service learning personnel go into high gear to achieve the necessary trip protocol: Dental student Lisa Gortari, class of 2010, treats a Raiders fan during the 2008 Clinic With a Heart Sunday.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 13SERViCE TO unDER-REPRESEnTED MinORiTiES Who are the supervising faculty? Do we have a State Department travel warning for the proposal? Are letters of invitation from the country and cooperating agencies available?Are the tickets ordered? Are student applicants in good standing? Are students alerted to attend orientation meetings? After the trip, assessment and reflection continues. W as it worthwhile? T wo students respond following a September 2009 visit to Bangladesh. I've traveled to many third-world countries in my time. I was even born in one. But to call Bangladesh third-world is an understatement about a country where forks and spoons are a luxury and health insurance is an urban legend, where 90 percent of the 159 million people deny the divinity of Christ, or have never even heard of Christianity. For seven days I witnessed people with the will and desire to accept what they cannot see\u2014the Good News. That was the miracle I witnessed in Bangladesh in September 2009. I was awakened at 3 o' clock in the morning by the sounds of people who wanted us to treat their ailments as they fought for a space in the line that was already forming. It hit me then how we were their hope for treatment that was so scarce and unavailable to them. I feel that I must somehow make my way to that country again in the near future, because, although we saw about 3,000 people, we only made a little dent in changing lives for the better. Under-represented minority recruitment The number of incoming under-represented minority students (URM's) showed an increase during the biennium. Of the 605 students enrolling at LLUSD for the 2008-2009 academic year, 67 were under-represented minorities (46 Hispanics, 20 African Americans and 1 American Indian). T welve URM students have been accepted to enter the class of 2014. A report in The Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education (May 4, 2009) indicated that LLUSD had tied for ninth place among the top 100 colleges offering doctoral degree programs to Hispanics. 2009-2010 marked the final year of the Pipeline grant, directed by Dean Charles Goodacre, SD'70, MSD, and Margie Arnett, MS, assistant professor, which provided tuition, books and housing as part of a post-baccalaureate program for students previously unsuccessful as dental school applicants. Of the four students admitted to the 2008-2009 Loma Linda University School of Dentistry Post-Baccalaureate program directed by Dan T an, SD'75, three were accepted into the class of 2013. The post-baccalaureate students participate each year in a four-week Southern California summer program on the campuses of LLU, UCLA, and USC, receiving individualized assessment of academic strengths and limitations before pursuing an academic year of studies, worships and tutorials designed to enhance their competence. In a workshop, \" Above the Bar,\" students also received assistance with study and test-taking skills. Online descriptions of the post-baccalaureate program gave it wide exposure. (See http://www.explorehealthcareers.org/en/Program.700.aspx#.) Clinic With a Heart volunteers create one of several rows of dental care service.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 14Enrichment programs for dental school aspirants Loma Linda University School of Dentistry continues to provide various summer-enrichment programs and an early selection agreement with students from feeder colleges. Careers in Dentistry Attendance at \"Careers in Dentistry\" increased in size each year for three years, with the 2008 event \"sold out\" in two weeks, lacking space for 50 people on the waiting list. Minorities in Dentistry T wo participants in the 2008 Minorities in Dentistry program, both graduate nurses seeking to extend their healthcare education, are now members of the class of 2012. They describe their appreciation for the introductory program: It gave a highlighted view of the whole field of dentistry\u2014radiology, endodontics, pediatrics. There's a large support base for minority students here. W e were able to ask questions like, \"How do finances work?\" and \"How do you make it through dental school?\" W e got to interact with a Hispanic woman, a black man, an Indian! That changes the perspective of students in the community. When you see someone who mirrors you, it brings a whole new meaning to the aspect, \"I can do it.\" Minorities Interested in the Health Sciences Dr. Leroy Reese from the School of Medicine started the MITHS program (minorities interested in the health sciences), a three-week summer enrichment program. The School of Dentistry has been actively participating since the program's inception and in both 2008 and 2009, 20 African-American high school students participated in science classes and explored the professions of dentistry and medicine. Si, Se Puede Begun in the late 1990s, the recruitment initiative Si, Se Puede (\"Y es, we can\"), hosted Latino high schoolers, introducing participants (47 in 2008, 50 in 2009) to careers made possible by their scholastic achievements. Participants toured the School, met dental students, learned about oral health care careers and carved a tooth out of clay. Loma Linda University School of Dentistry also staged annual visits from a primarily under-represented minority high school in Los Angeles, a direct \"feeder\" at the high school level.SERViCE TO unDER-REPRESEnTED MinORiTiES Cultural competency curriculum In addition to cultural diversity discussions and workshops for faculty and students, this program, an initiative involving all five California dental schools, is designed to create a more diverse student population and to increase access to care for the under-served in California. Numerous hours of cultural competency topics added into the curriculum elicited positive student response. Faculty education and recruitment In its commitment to diversity, LLUSD has instituted a faculty education program and an aggressive recruitment of under-represented minority faculty members. T wo underrepresented minority PhD basic scientists have completed their dental education in exchange for a long-term contractual commitment to teach at LLUSD; both are now full-time faculty members. Diversity committees The LLUSD diversity committee consists of eight faculty representatives. This year an additional task force was created by the dean for a one-year term. The committee members interact on boards of community partners rather than meeting regularly with an external advisory committee. Focusing on retention efforts, a student-based diversity committee initiated during the 2007-2008 school year consists of nine active student members, two faculty members (Ron Forde, SD'83, and Margie Arnett, MS), alumnus Alan W oodson, SD'87, and is coordinated by Marlise Perry, assistant director of admissions. Hispanic Scholarship and Recognition Awards At the T welfth Annual Hispanic Alumni of Loma Linda University banquet on October 12, 2008, Rosemary Morgan, class of 2010, was among ten recipients of the 2008 Hispanic Scholarships, and alumnus Richard Gutierrez, SD'90, MS'95, received the organization's Special Recognition Award.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 15cLINIc AdmINIsTRATION Paul L. Richardson, DDS, MEd Associate Dean, Clinic Administration Clinic Administration Overall this has been a busy, but productive two years for Clinic Administration, as care for patients continued at a high volume with no sacrifice in quality. December 31, 2009, marked the cessation of the adult DentiCal dental program. Many adults who received care at LLUSD have lost their public assistance. At the same time, California has been greatly affected by the recession resulting in high unemployment and loss of insurance benefits. The potential patient pool has remained high; last year over 16,000 individiuals who had an interest in becoming patients contacted the School. It is predicted this increased volume will continue since fees remain low and the School has become one of the few places to receive dental care at a reduced rate. A 300 percent increase in patients served in urgent care at the School of Dentistry is due to multiple factors, but high on the list is the way operations have been redesigned by Reggie Padgett, SD'82, who exhibits a high level of care for patients in need and vigor in treating those patients. Not only does this mean a valuable resource for the community is more available to meet their needs, but it increases the educational opportunities for our students. Faculty transitions The group practice model continued with some slight modification when Brian Black, SD'00, resigned as Clinical Group Practice Director to establish his own dental product line and dental supply company. Dr. Richardson assumed his role as part of the day-to-day operations of Clinic Administration. This change has given direct interaction between the group leaders and Dr. Richardson, creating a less complicated line of communication. IDP clinic management has merged with main clinic. While IDP retains its own clinic, all clinical faculty are under Clinic Administration and their group leaders meet with main clinic group leaders for weekly management meetings. With the move of IDP director Michael Fitzpatrick, SD'87, to a special projects role in Clinic Administration, Greg Mitchell, SD'84, became IDP director and is hard at work. Electronic record advances Clinic record management has become completely paperless. All documents are created or retained in an electronic format. All radiographs are now made as digital images and are stored on a DICOM server that is accessed through the electronic record, thereby tying the patients' documents together under one system. At the end of 2009, the central dental laboratory was poised to go paperless, once again creating an electronic lab form, billing process and tracking. With the predoctoral clinic completely electronic, the postdoctoral clinics are still creating a paper lab form, but are being tracked electronically. By the end of April 2010 all laboratory prescriptions for the entire dental school will be electronic. Loma Linda University has become actively involved in the development of the electronic record. Mrs. Marina Moore is director of Clinical Information Management. She and Dr. Richardson, with the help of the entire information system, have been providing site visits for other dental schools that are moving to the electronic system, axiUm. T o date, site visits or teleconferences have been provided for four dental schools. This year the School joined the research consortium of axiUm and became charter members of the financial consortium. This activity will help grow the School's own program, as interactions occur with other institutions. In addition, LLUSD will gain access to a large data pool for clinical research and best practices in the financial management process. Balsam Jekki, BDS, and Dr. Greg Mitchell presented the School's use of electronic records to teach diagnosis and treatment planning. B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 16cLINIc AdmINIsTRATION Student awards The class of 2009 created some records in the utilization of the clinic experience to maximize their clinical knowledge. T en group clinic awards and, as a first time event, two overall clinic achievement awards were given to students. Each recipient received a beautifully engraved glass plaque depicting Mt. Whitney with a description of their achievement, as well as a monetary gift. Communication with clinical faculty and students about materials, policy changes and protocols is always difficult. Nathan Dinsbach, SD'04, has created a communication newsletter that is edited and published by him. This document has proved to be a valuable and rapid way to \"get out the word.\" T o further this process a learning center has been established on the old orthodontic scheduling office that is used as a lunch and learn site for computer training and treatment planning seminars. This room was efficiently rehabbed by Thomas Milsom, including patching and painting the walls and providing some furniture from storage. This is the first time clinic has had a learning site that can seat ten people for close encounter interaction with a trainer or a small group utilizing electronic records to discuss care plans and care process. 2008 Senior Student Awards The Group Clinical Achievement Award This award is given to those students that best exemplify the characteristics of a dentist that rise above the standard expectations. These would include: Above average clinical performance, Individual growth Organized efficiency Accomplishing requirements while helping others Demonstration of grace and caring toward patients Jamie LeeJeffery FirestoneAndrey UstinekovJanelle Y angChris Hanson Michelle W all Kari Ann McKenzieJoel MicklewaitPatricia Ramos Overall Clinic Achievement Award This award goes to one student in each class who exhibits superior traits.

Publications A Contemporary Guide to Color and Shade Selection for Prosthodontists, which was completed in 2009, authored by Dean Charles Goodacre, as well as Dr. Rade Paravina from the University of Texas Dental Branch at Houston, Dr. Stephen Bergen from New York University College of Dentistry, and Dr. Jack Preston from the University of Southern California. This DVD-based program presents contemporary information regarding the science of color, normal and defective color vision, how color is described, the color of human teeth, dental shade guide designs, and guidelines that establish an optimal environment for shade selection and enhance the development of clinical color matching skills. Additionally, videos are included that show various methods by which shade selection can be accomplished clinically. A comprehensive re-write and re-design was accomplished for the admissions brochure, which presents information on the dental program, the International Dentist Program, the dental hygiene bachelor's program, and the dental hygiene degree completion program. A booklet for the care of dentures was authored by Nadim Baba, DDS and designed by Educational Support Services manager, Joe Arnett. Plans for further booklets are in the works, to provide patient education in a variety of disciplines.

Services now include wireless access in common areas of the School, an electronic patient record available securely from off campus, and computers at each station in the high-tech Nobel Biocare Laboratory. Electronic testing is possible through carefully configured networks, and students can now view faculty demonstrations on computer monitors in the laboratory. Incoming students are required to have access to computers with certain specifications, rather than a specific laptop. This change was made possible because of the installation of computers in the Nobel Biocare Lab, Urgent Care, Screening, International Dentist Program clinic, dental hygiene clinic and all specialty clinics. Computers will be installed in the main clinic during the summer of 2010, thus relieving students from the need to plug in their personal laptop when treating a patient. Dental Computer Services staff support nearly 1,400 electronic devices in Prince Hall, as well as at the Center for Dental Research, the Faculty Dental Office, and the Center for Dentistry and Orthodontics. The need for additional space to configure and maintain these devices required the conversion of the first floor kitchen into office and storage facilities. Plans to utilize technology for patient consultations are solidifying, as the School of Dentistry service area expands to remote areas such as Mead V alley, Mecca, and the mobile clinic. The Nobel Biocare Laboratory was remodeled in 2008 to accommodate 107 dental simulator workstations.

The 2009 Convention honored the class of 1959, where a great showing was due in no small part to classmate Bill Heisler. That year also saw the 50-year celebration for the dental hygiene program. The annual dental hygiene luncheon was stepped up to an even classier event with four members of the original dental hygiene class attending, and founding chair, Violet Bates, interviewed on the telephone for everyone to hear. The Alumni Student Loan Fund, originated in 1987, is currently receiving over $50,000 a month from interest and principle being repaid from the nearly $4,000,000 in current loans to alumni. An astonishing $11,000,000 has been loaned out in the last 23 years, yet the default rate remains a mere 1.85%. Once again, the alumni have exhibited integrity and represent their alma mater well. The Alumni Association continues to sponsor Bibles and white coats for presentation during the annual student dedication program each February, as well as the graduation reception and the biennial Alumni Directory. The Alumni Association Student of the Y ear in 2008 was Karl Northrup, who demonstrated a willingness to assist the School and the Alumni Association; in 2009, Brian Evans was chosen, in part because of his efforts in rallying his classmates toward philanthropic efforts while still in school.

The funds raised at the Exhibitors' Fair ($17,000 in 2008-09) financed student representatives' trips on lobby day in February (meeting with legislators, senators, and other political leaders), to the annual session in March, at regional dental meetings in August, and during a leadership conference in November. Lunch and Learn events initiated by students have brought professional lecturers to the campus. Students heard Dr. William Dorfman, Los Angeles cosmetic dentist and consultant for such ABC hit series as Extreme Makeover and Entertainment T onight, describe the spectrum of his professional pursuits. Students active in planning for Lunch and Learn have included Nick Marongui, Adam Burr, W eston Spencer, and Donavon Y apshing. A Pine Springs Ranch retreat in October 2008 and November 2009 welcomed students and their family members to a weekend in the mountains for hiking, biking, playing football, and relaxing. The finale, organized by the student association officers, featured classes competing in games and performances. In addition to the Pine Springs Ranch retreat, the Dental Student Association planned a series of social events annually such as T ofurkey Bowl, Roller Skate night, Dental School BBQ's, Movie-on-the-Lawn night, intermural sports, bake sales, and Cookie Day.

Dental anesthesiology curriculum development Dr. Barry Krall has been integrating simulation into the dental anesthesiology curriculum. Currently, two or three residents undergo weekly simulation training at the new Simulation Center in the Centennial Complex. Predoctoral curriculum innovations Barry Krall, DDS, assistant professor, dental anesthesi- ology, completed preparation of a DVD for predoctoral students on which he demonstrates all the local anesthetic injections. In 4- to 7-minute segments, narration by Joni Stephens, EdS, MS, RDH, professor, Department of Dental Hygiene, explains close ups of Dr. Krall's work with patients receiving injections. The DVD covers eight local anesthesia procedures, nitrous oxide sedation, and emergency airway management. Students receive a manual accompanying the DVD. In 2009 Dr. Krall initiated an honors program in local anesthesia to teach interested and qualified students advanced injection techniques. The following twelve students are enrolled (four D4 and eight D3): Adam Burr, Larina Chu, Andrew Corbett, Lisa Gortari, David Green, Patrick Hachee, Michael Hiersche, Bryan Horgan, Jonathan Jackson, Stuart Seheult, Christopher T orres and Donavon Y apshing. Department of Anesthesiology and Special Care Dentistry Continuing education innovation The Department of Anesthesiology and Special Care Dentistry sponsored LLUSD's 28 th and 29th anesthesia symposiums (2008 and 2009) during the February alumni conventions, with lectures by Jesus Berdeja, MD, LLUSM, Raymond W ong, MD, LLUSM, Barry Krall, SD'90, assistant professor, John Leyman, DDS, assocate professor, Kimberly Otsuka, MD, and Larry Trapp, DDS, MS, associate professor. During the 2008 session, Drs. Trapp and Krall introduced an innovative, simulation session. Simulation training, well established in complex, high risk industries such as aviation, nuclear power, and the military, was pioneered in anesthesia in the mid-1980s. Using high fidelity, interactive patient simulations, it has fostered development of superior clinical skills without risk to patients. The session addressed management of medical emergencies most commonly encountered in the dental office. Continuing education programs presented in other venues Dr. Trapp presented a day-long continuing education course entitled \"Pre-anesthesia Preparation and Management of the Medically Compromised Dental Patient\" to the California Society of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Costa Mesa, CA, on November 5, 2008.

A healthy, natural tooth uniquely aids chewing.\" N Faculty transitions On July 1, 2009, Leif K. Bakland, SD'63, founding chair of the School's Department of Endodontics, stepped down from the position. Guiding the department for 29 of his 33 years on campus, Dr. Bakland felt it was time to start moving toward semi-retirement. A widely published textbook editor and professional writer, the much-traveled Dr. Bakland has lectured in more than 200 venues on six of earth's seven continents. He continues to serve as LLUSD's gray emminence and scribe, recording its history and achievements as well as remaining active in both the predoctoral and postdoctoral programs. Robert Handysides, SD'93, became chair of the Department of Endodontics in July 2009. Dr. Handysides practiced general dentistry in Canada before entering LLUSD's advanced education program in endodontics. He joined the faculty in 2001. Upon completing a residency in the endodontics program in September 2009, Bonnie Retamozo, SD'05, accepted a faculty appointment.B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 55authors included Drs.

Patient statistics The anesthesiology department treated nearly 10,000 patients during the biennium, approximately 85% of whom were under 21 years of age. Remodeled facilities With a patient population that necessarily arrives with care providers, space is important. Keeping pace with the opening of the Koppel SCD Center in May 2007, and the introduction of axiUm, when the School's comprehensive clinic management software package was installed in 2008, the department upgraded its clinical facilities and support areas with a number of small remodeling projects: Transforming a storage area to the staff break area (2008)Remodeling the original staff break area to create a consultation room for dentists discussing treatments options with the care provider and obtaining consent for treatment (2008)Altering the exam room to provide an area for computer access to electronic medical records (2009)Converting a second storage area to a private consultation room (2009)Advanced Education Program Dental Anesthesiology A career in dental anesthesiology allows a dentist to provide the full scope of perioperative pain and anxiety management for patients undergoing all types of dental treatment. Residents in the Advanced Education Program in Dental Anesthesiology render anesthesia care for dental patients in the Koppel Special Care Dentistry (SCD) Center. Most of the approximately 5,000 yearly patients are preoperative pediatric and adult special needs patients who receive general anesthesia by the dental anesthesiology residents, with the dental treatment provided by members of the School of Dentistry faculty. Residency information The Advanced Education Program in Dental Anesthe - siology accepts six residents each year into a 24-month training program. The residents rotate to three regional medical centers for a total of thirteen months, for expe - rience in operating room protocol, medical anesthesia, cardiology, and internal medicine. LLU offers one of the most clinically intensive dental anesthesiology residency programs in the United States. In order to track the actual number of cases each resident provides, and to be able to provide meaningful resident evaluations, the residents input each case profile and statistics into a web-based software package purchased by the department.

Data collected from its own sources and faculty observations in dentistry and endodontics are used to modify the program. T echnological and curricular innovations are designed to keep students abreast of advances both in general dentistry and in endodontics. With a numerical requirement of 250 cases, the 27-month program provides students experience in clinical endodontics and time to complete their research projects.Students now take a course in conscious sedation to become eligible for certification in moderate sedation. Literature reviews have become electronic and are continually updated to prepare students for evidence-based practice and the American Board of Endodontics (ABE) examination.Students present 15 cases according to ABE guidelines before completing the program.Feedback from the program director at least every six months provides monitoring of student progress.The nature of research in the department is changing from basic science and animal studies to clinical investigations. Systematic reviews conducted in the program will become the foundation of future clinical studies. Postdoctoral students continue to have the opportunity to serve as mentors for predoctoral students and gain valuable teaching experience. Accreditation results An ongoing outcomes assessment program and reevaluation process aided the diretor in preparing copious documentation for the accreditation self- study report and on-site assessment during the February 2009 site visit by the Commission on Dental Accreditation. Faculty award Recipient of the School's Distinguished Research Award, Mahmoud T orabinejad, DMD, MSD, PhD, program director, was recognized at the 2009 commencement for his extensive research activities: identification of mediators of inflammation in pulp and periradicular disease, and development of dental materials\u2014mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), and a mixture of tetracycline, an acid, and a detergent (MTAD). MTAD is a combination device and drug for use in root canal therapy. MTA has profoundly affected the practice of endodontics, improving the prognosis and outcomes in difficult clinical situations.

Herford, DDS, MD Director Advanced Education Program Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery LLUSD offers two graduate programs in oral and maxillofacial surgery\u2014a four-year program, and a six-year program leading to an MD degree. Both programs lead to a certificate with an optional Master of Science (MS) or Master of Science in Dentistry (MSD) degree. Newsletter publication The Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery program published its first newsletter in 2008 and a subsequent one in 2009. Issued to faculty, staff, and alumni of the program, the newsletter is also distributed to members of oral and maxillofacial surgery programs throughout the United States. Faculty educational programs Drs. Boyne and Herford participated in surgeon-training programs throughout the United States during the first half of 2008 in conjunction with Medtronic Corporation, explaining how to use bone morphogenetic proteins. Faculty transitions A remarkable career in oral and maxillofacial surgery ended on June 9, 2008, when Dr. Philip J. Boyne, 84, died. A man whose scholarly pursuits and innovations had a global impact, Dr. Boyne continued research and lecturing until months before his death. His collaboration with Alan Herford, SD'94, MD, on a textbook chapter in Tissue Engineering: Applications in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery and Periodontics (2008) and on a paper published in a 2008 issue of the Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery underlined his commitment to benefit patients and professionals with his skills and research as long as his energies permitted. Faculty highlights Dr. Herford, who serves on the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, was chosen to be a site visitor for the Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) for OMS programs. He also is a director of the board for the California Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and in 2008 became a fellow of the American College of Surgeons.

Clinic activity High quality service in the Hutto-Patterson Pediatric Dental Clinic is enhanced by eight dental assistants\u2014John Ayon, Gracie Cuevas, Kathy Dillon, T oni Montecinos, V eronica Perez, Ebony Reece, and Patty Stokes\u2014by the clinic supervisor, Lilian Andrade, and by the patient coordinators\u2014Magda Lavergne, Brenda Montesinos, and Karla Ellsworth. Procedure innovation brought to LLUSD Dr. Chen has introduced to LLUSD a new procedure for improving cleft palate treatment (Presurgical Naso- Alveolar Molding Appliance), developed by Drs. Barry Grayson and Court Cutting at New Y ork University Medical Center. Instead of the customary (up to 10 plus) surgeries required to correct cleft palates, the Presurgical Nasoalveolar molding (PNAM) applianc she uses makes corrections that will require fewer surgeries in the future and better surgical results. In what Dr. Chen calls a parent-surgeon-dentist part - nership, frequent application of the PNAM diminishes the cleft and lifts the nose, reducing the size of the cleft gap before surgery. The PNAM team welcomes\u2014and indeed befriends\u2014babies at a mere 2 to 3 months old to begin the molding process.

Henkin, DDS, MS Director Advanced Education Program Periodontics The Advanced Education Program in Periodontics emphasizes high-level technical procedures: esthetic and prosthetic-related mucogingival surgery, resective and regenerative surgical procedures, surgical placement of root-form implants, and preparatory augmentation and repairs. Students pursue didactic, clinical, and research components in the program that lead to a professional certificate with the option to either a Master of Science (MS) or a Master of Science in Dentistry (MSD) degree. 20th Annual Inter-City Periodontics Research Forum Periodontal students at LLUSD hosted students from USC, UCLA, and the Greater Los Angeles V eterans Heath Care Center at the San Bernardino Hilton in May 2009 for the 20th Annual Inter-City Periodontics Research Forum. A lecture format developed by the group made provision for graduate students from each of the schools to present individual research projects. Research awards First-place $1,000 awards in three different categories went to three LLUSD postdoctoral periodontal students, who submitted projects to the California Society of Periodontists Research Competition. \"I believe that this is the first time that Loma Linda Universtity School of Dentistry graduate students captured first place in all of the categories that they entered at the CSP meeting,\" said Dr. Henkin.Roger Anderson, SD'05, MS'09, entered his project in the non-surgical therapy, diagnostics and clinical etiologic research category: \"Factors influencing contrast resolution of cone beam CT using the CB MercuRay.\" Drs. Jeffrey Henkin and Bernard Gantes, mentors. Dr. Anderson received an MS degree at the June 2009 commencement. Chun-Xiao Sun, DDS, PhD, MSD'09, associate professor, submitted a project in the basic research category: 'The expression changes of inflammatory mediators, adenosine receptors, in chronic human periodontitis: A preliminary study.\" In June 2009 Dr. Sun received an MSD degree based on this research.

Gifts for calendar years 2008-09 totaled more than $5.8 million dollars. Special gifts by alumni, faculty, staff, foundations, and corporations are significant components of the total amount raised. Endowment funds The first endowment fund for the School of Dentistry was established during the 1989-90 academic year. As of June 30, 2009, School of Dentistry endowment/foundation accounts have a value of more than $10 million dollars. A new scholarship endowment fund was established in 2008 with $50,000 in memory of David W ayne Nelson, SD'71. Alumni support More than $400,000 was raised by the Alumni Association Century Club for various projects including service learning scholarships, the Bibles and white coats presented at the student dedication service, research awards, and other Alumni Association board-approved projects. Six classes of alumni raised more than $10,000 each during the biennium. The class of 1963 raised $30,650 and the class of 1959 raised $50,000 in honor of their 50th year. The classes of 2008 and 2009 each established an endowment fund, putting the balance of their proceeds from fundraising activities at the conclusion of their educational career into their accounts. Both classes have close to $20,000 that will continue to grow until they have a project they choose to support at a significant honor year. Endowed professorships A major achievement of the School of Dentistry over the past few years has been funding two professorships. The first professorship was started by Dr. Ronald E. Buell with a significant personal investment over 20 years ago. After his death, colleagues continued working toward the goal of establishing the Ronald E. Buell Professorship in Endodontics. At the 2008 commencement ceremonies, School of Dentistry dean, Charles J. Goodacre, DDS, MSD, announced the appointment of Dr. Leif K. Bakland as the first Ronald E. Buell Professor of Endodontics. The second professorship was started by faculty member, Dr. Philip J. Boyne, who made a significant investment, and together with a friend, Dr. Peter Geistlich, a life-long resident of Zurich, Switzerland, the Boyne-Geistlich Professorship in Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery came into existence. The professorship is intended to support the efforts of the appointee to explore new avenues of treatment, promote the teaching of oral and maxillofacial surgery, Maynard Lowry, PhD Director, Gift Planning and Special GiftsB I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 88dEvELOPmENT and advanced dentistry through innovation in patient care.This professorship recognizes distinguished faculty in oral and maxillofacial surgery, and will help retain talented surgeons committed to advancing the mission of the University. The selection of Dr. Alan S. Herford, as the inaugural Philip Boyne - Peter Geistlich Professor of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery was announced at the graduation ceremonies on May 25, 2008. Planned giving Planned gifts for 2008-2009 totaled more than $263,000, and gifts-in-kind received totaled more than $307,000. A year ago the School of Dentistry began sending Gift Legacy educational materials by e-mail to alumni and friends of the School. In addition, special brochures, such as Planning for the Future: Preparing Your Will or Trust , and Planning for the Future: What Your Family Needs to Know , are now available.

B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 89dEvELOPmENT Dean's Circle More than 20 years ago Dean Judson Klooster announced the formation of a new leadership organization to encourage annual giving. The original group of 44 has grown to 248 loyal alumni, friends, faculty, and staff whose generosity drives the School of Dentistry to build on its status as one of the top dental schools in the country. Each year members of the Dean's Circle meet for a dinner at the Summit House Restaurant in Fullerton, California. The largest number of DDS alumni who are members in the Dean's Circle come from the class of 1974, with the classes of 1969, 1970, 1988, and the dean's own class of 1971, and the class of 1972 right behind them. Arlene Klooster, widow of the founder, as well as former dean Charles T. Smith are honorary members. Individuals making a leadership gift of $1,500 or more during a calendar year are invited to become members of the Dean's Circle. Gifts to any School of Dentistry fund qualify for membership. In addition to gifts of cash, gifts may be made on a regular basis, through payroll deduction or with a major credit card. Dental hygiene Celebrating 50 Y ears of Dental Hygiene Service, Kris Wilkins, DH'80, department chair, and Joni Stephens, DH'69, former chair, invited alumni to take a quiet moment to relax and enjoy a complimentary \"spot of tea\" at their convenience while they celebrated the dental hygiene profession and the education received at Loma Dean Goodacre visits with Dr. Lowry and Ms. Terwillegar.Linda University. Sent as a formal invitation, with a package of herbal tea, the invitation generated positive response for the annual fund campaign. Alumni provided 83 percent of the dental hygiene gifts; 7 percent came from non-alumni, and 13 percent from corporations and organizations. Scholarships awarded in 2009 alone totaled more than $24,000, of which $13,000 came from the dental hygiene class of 1969. Thirteen per cent of all alumni participate in the annual fund, while 60% of them give at an Ivory Society level of $100 or more each year. Five Dental Hygiene alumni are members of the Dean's Circle. Staff activity Director of development, Rachel T erwillegar, CFRE, CSPG, and director of gift planning and special gifts, Maynard Lowry, PhD, continue to maintain trust services certification by the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which requires 20 hours of annual continuing education. Dr. Lowry visits with alumni throughout the United States and abroad. With Dean Charles J. Goodacre, alumni receptions were held in Northern California, Arizona, Nevada, New England, and T exas. Development assistant, Mary Donahue, received her master's of business administration degree in June 2009 from University of Redlands.

WHO officials, increasingly aware that 40 percent of the medical care in developing countries is provided by faith-based organizations, engaged for the first time in discussions designed to collaborate with faith-based organizations. They elected to stage their first interaction with members of the General Conference Department of Health Ministries. Approximately 700 medically affiliated church employees met for 14 hours with WHO employees in joint meetings. During the continuing education presentations (over 250 presentations by 140 international specialists), lecturers from the around the world, including five LLUSD faculty, reviewed a broad spectrum of topics: oral infection, cariology, minimally invasive dentistry, systemic disease and its effect on oral health, endodontics, African dental disease challenges, HIV/AIDS, and reports on each Seventh-day Adventist dental school. Lecturers included Stanton S. Appleton, SD'72, MPH, MSD, MAGD, clinical Robert PG'01, chair, SD'06, assistant professor, Restorative Dentistry; and Thomas Rogers, SD'83, MPH, MA, direcor, Faculty Leadership & Development. Dentists invited to participate from other schools of dentistry included Hector Hernandez, DDS, and Zeno Charles Marcel, MD, of Montemorelos Unversity, Marissa Virgines, DDM, MPH, dean, Adventist University of College of Dentistry, and Ezekiel Midamba, DMD, DDPH, MSD, MS, of Norway. Recordings of the conference are available at www. HealthMinistries.com. Alumni recognition for international service The directors of International Dental Affairs estimate that more than 700 dentists are eligible to have their names appear on pavers circling a globe designed for a new campus Centennial W alk. This recognition is reserved for alumni who have participated in one or more years of international service. Overseas deployment The office of International Dental Affairs maintains support for 76 dental clinics around the world that affiliate with the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Health Ministries Department.

During the current biennial period, they visited clinics, consulted with staff, assessed needs, and oversaw repairs in these countries: Negotiations for Masai Dental Clinc transfer Negotiations with NASDAD completed in 2009 will accomplish transfer of a Masai Dental Clinic operated by W orld Health Dental Organization (WHDO) to become a NASDAD operation in partnership with LLUSD. The clinic, built by Ray \"Safari Dentist\" Damazo, DDS, provides dental care at no charge to the more than 30,000 Masai people who live within walking distance. Now it will also become a site for LLUSD students to broaden their awareness of global dental needs. Stuart Rich, SD'87, describes a patient encounter at the Masai Dental Clinic: Namoidu's face is etched with six decades of living in the hardscrabble life of a Masai. T oday it is etched with something else\u2014deep, relentless pain. The fissures and lines embedded by years of exposure to the elements cover her face and neck\u2014except for her grossly swollen lower right neck and jaw area, where the skin is drawn and tight. She sits sidesaddle on the dental chair, protecting the upholstery from her travel-worn plastic shoes. An x-ray reveals that numbers 31 and 32 are grossly decayed. The dental assistant explains in Namoidu's own language that she will give her an Akinosi block. With the anesthetic on-board and profound, I remove the culprit responsible for weeks of constant pain. My reward is a healthy flow of vile pus from the sockets. After some manual decompression and suction, the effect on Namoidu's appearance is immediate and dramatic. Not especially demonstrative, Namoidu clasps one of my large, smooth white hands with both of her thin, rough ebony ones. She says quietly, \" Asanta Sana\" (thank you very much), before shuffling out the door. The moisture at the corner of her eyes is relief from pain; in mine it is from gratitude for the opportunity to serve her.

Dr. Ray Damazo, known in Africa as the \"Safari Dentist,\" established the Masai Dental Clinic in an area of Africa just five miles from the world-famous Masai Mara National Game Park in Kenya, East Africa, on property leased for 33 years. W orking in the area for over 20 years to provide dental care at no charge to the more than 30,000 Masai people who live within walking distance, which can mean as many as 30-40 miles, Dr. Damazo, along with his wife, Gayle, began treating the local people where he found them. W orking out of their Land Rover and two-axle, four-wheel trailer, they have so endeared themselves to the local people and the game park tour operators that they were asked to establish a fixed dental facility. Dr. Damazo, now well past normal retirement age, will turn his non-profit W orld Health Dental Organization over to NASDAD on July 1, 2010. The recently built stone block building includes a second story, 1200 square foot, manager's apartment, and two smaller apartments for visiting clinicians. Each of the three fully equipped dental operatories includes fully functioning dental units and dental x-ray equipment. The clinic has full compressed air, vacuum and sterilization equipment as well as a lab and storage room. Of special interest to LLUSD will be the availability of the clinic for \"Service Learning\" rotations by dental and dental hygiene students supervised by LLUSD faculty members or volunteer dentists with LLUSD adjunct faculty appointments.National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists The National Association of Seventh-day Adventist Dentists (NASDAD) acknowledges with sincere thanks the logistical support of the Loma Linda University School of Dentistry (LLUSD) to the organization. The generous assistance of an Executive Secretary and office space for our secretary-treasurer and executive director are a major cost saving and convenience to NASDAD, savings that can be passed on to greater mission support. Having direct access to the associate director for Dental Affairs of the General Conference of Seventhday Adventists, housed in the same office, is most effective. In its quiet, yet highly successful way, NASDAD has made, over the past 65 plus years, perhaps the greatest impact on dental care of any faith-based organization both in the United States and in the developing world. Each year NASDAD continues to provide funding for assistance to Loma Linda University School of Dentistry student \"Service Learning\" dental mission trips and, in conjunction with the General Conference Health Department, monetary assistance, guidance and support to a network of 76 clinics on five continents. Fiscal year 2008 donations to NASDAD'S YAMM (Y ear Around Mission Money) fund totaled $57,000. And $39,000 was used to support 15 dental mission projects. Response to requests for mission funding through the YAMM fund, voted at the October 2009 annual membership meeting in Kona, Hawaii, totaled $112,000, with over $11,000 received in the mission appeal offering at that meeting.

A yearly Christmas party at a faculty's home has become a \"can't-miss\" event due to the great food and fellowship that occurs. Dr. Mitchell has started a new tradition by organizing and leading a yearly houseboat/boating trip to Lake Mohave or Lake Powell for senior class students and their families. Highlights Late in 2009, Gregory Mitchell, SD'84, took the position of director, moving from the position of clinic director. Former IDP director, Michael Fitzpatrick, SD'87, has remained intimately involved, continuing to teach in lectures and clinic, and will be relied on for excellent counsel. IDP continues to enjoy a 100% pass rate for licensing examinations and always enjoys celebrating the success of its varied and multicultural graduates. Competition for the 24 available program positions continues to escalate each year. Changes in the program were received very favorably by CODA (Council on Dental Accreditation) site visitors during the School's accreditation visit in early 2009. Investigators singled out the IDP program for praise, calling it \"an excellent and well-organized International Dentist Program.\" Awards Klaus W olfram, SD '71, MS '73, associate professor, a W est German immigrant by way of Canada (1958) and the United States Army (1960-1963), was awarded the International Dental Program T eacher of the Y ear for the fourth consecutive year. Profoundly international As the International Dentist Program continues to produce graduates, the national identies of its alumni grow increasingly diverse. After 26 years in operation, IDP has alumni from the following 78 countries:International Dentist Program After major changes to the International Dentistry Program in 2007, improvements on the successful basic framework continue. The pre-program was implemented in 2008, comprising an extra quarter of specific hand-skill education that occurs before the start of the regular program. This program enables academically qualified students, whose previous programs provided limited opportunity to develop hand-skill experience, an opportunity to join the program. After completion of this pre-program, the students seamlessly begin the regular program with their fellow classmates. Consequently, for the past three years, five or six students each year have been able to participate in the IDP program who otherwise would not have qualified. A service learning opportunity has been developed in which students rotate through the Meet Each Need with Dignity (MEND) clinic in the San Fernando Valley. International trips are also offered. During the past two years, Drs. Michael Fitzpatrick and Gregory Mitchell have led trips to the Amazon River and Leon, Mexico. Loma Linda's International Program is unique in that admission requirements include successfully passing both Part I and II of national boards. Most dental schools require the passing of Part I only, and incorporate students directly into their traditional programs. Loma Linda's approach puts a greater emphasis on clinical experience and a focus on the \"Loma Linda Philosophy\" of clinical practice. A family atmosphere continues to be important to the program.

Gary Nelson, true to his business sense, negotiated a consulting contract with C3 Results based on resultant increased revenues in FDO. Not only did the FDO achieve increased production\u2014it reached a 60 percent increase in December 2009\u2014but more importantly, patients, impressed with the service, were declaring that communication with the office was superior to that experienced any other office they had patronized. Both C3 Results and FDO had met their expectations. C3 Results strategies included intense examination of team interaction, case presentations, and patient service. With the ensuing emphasis on maximizing the advantage of multiple practitioners on site, the FDO team has evolved into a community that seeks to provide service exceeding the patient's expectations. T wenty-seven dentists working in groups of twelve have established quotas and production goals and established an in-house referral and appointment apportionment system that efficiently utilizes the office personnel. T o provide a stable presence at the office, the FDO welcomed Kevin Brown, SD'07, in November 2009 as a full-time dentist to provide continuity of care and oversee the distribution of dental services. Says Dr. Caruso: \"The team has been energized; they are delivering more Faculty Dental Practices A multiple purpose practice A primary focus of the Faculty Dental Office (FDO) is to become a premier site for comprehensive dental care. The practice has the potential to provide patients with the multiple expertise and interaction of a select group of dentists. Additionally, the FDO exists to enhance faculty practitioners' careers as they continue their skills in dentistry, develop new skills, augment their faculty incomes. Management strategies With the plan to establish the Faculty Dental Office (FDO) at a new Hospitality Lane site in 2010, Joseph Caruso, DDS, MS, MPH, associate dean, Strategic Initiatives & Faculty Practice, chair, Department of Orthodontics, undertook during spring quarter 2009 the appointment of overseeing the transition and organization of the office to ensure that it would achieve its inherent potential. Collaborating with Gary Nelson, director in the patient business office and faculty practices, Dr. Caruso initiated plans for training faculty and developing a new vision of management.

The Faculty Dental Offices (right) long housed two hundred yards east and slightly north of Prince Hall will relocate and expand into the ground floor of the Center for Dentstry and Orthodontics on Hospitality Lane (below). The facility houses both the Center for Dentistry (the faculty practice) and the Center for Orthodontics (the graduate orthodontic program and all orthodontic faculty offices).B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 98cENTER fOR dENTAL REsEARch yiming Li, DDS, PhD, MS Director A Research Strategic Committee is working diligently to formulate the future research goals as well as measures to achieve these goals. The short-term objectives include establishing research areas of excellence, pursuing NIH funding, and continuing to enhance the research capacity. Within the last year, four grant proposals have been submitted to the NIH, with a number of additional proposals planned; the capacity of clinical research facility will soon be more than doubled. Efforts have also been made to increase the research-based scientific publications. Four research faculty joined the CDR Lincoln Edwards , PhD, SD'09, assistant professor, earned his PhD in pharmacology in 1998 at Loma Linda University with a dissertation that explored the mechanism of physalia venom-induced 45calcium uptake by cultured cells; he also completed a two-year postdoctoral training at Case Western Reserve University in 2001, where he conducted research in areas of pharmacology and nutrition. Dr. Lincoln's current research is focused on the assessment of novel compounds acquired from European sources to determine whether some will control blood sugar without triggering an insulin reaction. One particular compound he is investigating appears to have the possibility of ameliorating simultaneously high blood pressure and diabetes. Such an outcome, he notes, would have a very significant and helpful impact on periodontal diseases. Neal Johnson, PhD, SD'08, assistant professor of oral diagnosis, radiology and pathology, is a graduate of LLUSD. He came to the study of dentistry with a doctorate in microbiology from Loma Linda University in 2004 that emphasized molecular genetics. Center for Dental Research The Center for Dental Research (CDR) at Loma Linda University School of Dentistry has grown to its 10 th anniversary in 2009. With the School's commitment to and support of research, the CDR continued its success in research funded by government and industries as well as student research programs over the last years. The School has increased its research budget by providing new salary support to six faculty members pursuing research excellence in areas of lasers, imaging, molecular biology, bone, herbal pharmacology, and esthetic dentistry. The CDR has been providing assistance to several new research faculty members with their needs for technical staff and initial seed funding. A number of new pieces of equipment have also been acquired to enhance the research capability in existing and newly expanded research areas. In addition, the CDR also provides matching funds for new equipment, supporting faculty of other departments for their needs for research supplies and technical staff, and travel to attend scientific meetings. The CDR continues to be active in collaborative research at the University, national and international levels. CDR faculty members have served as members in national and international standards committees, as consultants to the American Dental Association, California Dental Association and several other national and state organizations, and on the Food and Drug Administration Dental Products Panel between 2006 and 2009.Lincoln Edwards, PhD, DDS Neal Johnson, PhD, DDS B I E N N I A L R E P O R T 2 008 & 200 9 99cENTER fOR dENTAL REsEARch Since July 2009, Dr. Johnson has been serving as chair of the LLUSD research committee. In his research, Dr. Johnson is assessing unidentified antimicrobial peptides that have the potential to treat oral infections\u2014bacterial, fungal, or viral. He has also identified two genes in common oral bacteria that may have antibacterial properties and is conducting experiments to establish the spectrum of those properties. Steven Kurti, Jr., PhD, joined the School as a full-time faculty in the summer of 2009 as associate professor and director of photonics and biomaterials laboratory at the Center for Dental Research. Dr. Kurti earned his PhD degree in physics at Case W estern Reserve University, Cleveland in 2005, for his work with solid-state lasers and nonlinear optics. As a civilian employee for the United States Navy, Dr. Kurti was assigned to the Naval Air W arfare Center in China Lake, where he spent much of his time assembling two new laboratories and writing grants to support them. In the last several years he has acquired over $2 million in extramural funding and has submitted a fiber laser related patent application. Dr. Kurti comes to the LLUSD with experience in lasers, spectroscopic studies, nonlinear optics, and fiber optics along with an informal education in his father's orthodontics practice. With these tools, he expects to investigate laser effects on dentition and dental materials as well as the potential of lasers for therapeutic and imaging purposes. Mei Lu, DDS, PhD, MS, associate professor of oral and maxillofacial surgery, joined the LLUSD with a great enthusiasm for the value of research. \"When they are practicing dentists,\" she says of her predoctoral students, \"they will be better practitioners if they understand how to perform a literature review and learn how to evaluate current research. It is a vital part of their training here at the LLUSD.\" Dr. Lu pursued academic and professional credentials earned at Zhejiang University in China, Sydney Uni - versity in Australia, and the University of Hong Kong with energy prompted by personal experience. The recipient of numerous awards for her research, Dr. Lu is conducting research studies on EMP-2, a drug that stimulates one's own adult stem cells to grow bone and was recently approved by the Food and Drug Adminis - tration for use as a bone-filling material in dentistry. Recently Dr. Lu, with a team at the CDR, has been collaborating with David J. Baylink, MD, an adjunct professor in the School of Dentistry, who is an interna - tionally renowned scholar in bone research with more then 800 publications currently cited throughout the literature. The CDR is in the process of establishing a bone research laboratory where Dr. Lu will be one of the primary members of a bone research team. Dr. Lu's special expertise in bone physiology has made her a principal investigator in an ongoing private study that will establish further applications for bone morphogenetic proteins. LLUSD Chapter for AADR NSRG established An LLUSD Chapter of the American Association for Dental Research (AADR) National Student Research Group (NSRG) has recently been established. The officers\u2014Justin W and Michael Knutson, SD'11, secretary\u2014 are working with faculty advisors Drs.
