The Company is strategically spreading our footprint to the Country's Tier III and Tier IV cities, which have high untapped potential.

However, India's accelerated vaccination drive provided much-awaited relief and led to the resurgence of the Indian economy. With the learnings and experience of the previous year and exercising prudence, we at ABFL have emerged more robust than earlier by keeping the customer needs at the centre of all our initiatives. We are proud of the hard work of our teams and the significant progress we have made during this time. 10Year in review The year gone by has been filled with several external challenges. ABFL has always strived to be a Company that is distinctive, united and unafraid to push the boundaries. This desire to always improve and look at things differently has benefited the Companies' growth. While economic activity was severely hit by the 2 nd wave of the pandemic, the last two quarters of FY22 witnessed revival in domestic economic activity with an uptick in most of the high frequency indicators of economic activity. This revival was supported by continuing fiscal measures and congenial financial conditions engendered by monetary, regulatory and liquidity initiatives undertaken by the Reserve Bank. Private consumption, the mainstay of aggregate demand in India, partially recuperated which led to gradual pick-up in bank credit, especially in the personal and consumer loans segment. Credit growth also accelerated in agriculture, MSMEs and select services. Industrial credit growth improved steadily after Q1 FY22 and accelerated to 7.1% in March 2022. Medium-sized industries, in particular, registered a growth of 71.4% in March 2022, as compared with 34.5% a year ago. Credit to micro and small industries also posted a faster growth of 21.5% in March 2022 from 3.9% a year ago. The growth recorded in the MSME sector's credit demand is largely attributable to the government's impetus and the Reserve Bank's policies to revive the sector. ABFL is set to leverage on the untapped potential from underpenetrated and underserved regions in the country where the formal financial services have less to no presence. The Company is continuously expanding presence in the Tier III and Tier IV cities. During the year, ABFL focused on developing our capabilities in the digital space, improve customer experience and product offerings. The Company added 65 branches, taking the total count to 159 at the end of the year under review. Performance While the operations were severely impacted during the initial months, the Company closed the year with a 13% growth in our Loan Book, which stood at 55,180 Crore as against 48,689 Crore at the end of FY 2020-21. The Net Interest Income increased to 3,091 Crore from 2,512 Crore, primarily led by growth in the lending book along with optimised borrowing cost with a 10% reduction. The revenue and PAT increased to 5,797 Crore and 1,108 Crore from 5,528 Crore and 769 Crore, respectively. Further, the Company maintained strong liquidity with cash and liquid investments of 693 Crore and unutilized bank credit lines of 5,262 Crore as on 31 st March 2022. The Cost of Borrowing (COB) and Cost of Funds (COF) reduced to 6.88% and 5.49%, respectively, during the year. ABFL also raised long-term funds through multiple sources, amounting to 12,719 Crore, thus taking our outstanding debt to 46,052 Crore - which was as a testament to our dynamic liquidity management. Credit quality During the year, the stressed assets stood at 1,733 Crore, amounting to ~3.1% of our GS3 book of the previous financial year. At the same time, the Company further increased our GS3 provision coverage to 773 Crore from 590 Crore by the end of the year and created a floating COVID-19 provision of 186 Crore. 73% of the total loan portfolio is secured and an additional 4% of the portfolio is guaranteed under the CGTSME guarantee scheme (SIDBI). ABFL held security value of 1,00,800 Crore as against loan book of 55,180 Crore and security value of 1,771 Crore as against Net Stage 3 assets of 960 Crore thereby closing the year with a net security cover of 1.8x. Digitalisation The Company continues to invest in its digital capabilities. The Company always strives to enhance client experiences and quality of our services. ABFL is seamlessly onboarding new consumers and partners via digital channels. The cutting-edge LOS and LMS are upgraded to increase process accessibility and transparency. In addition, the Company has developed numerous digital customer self-service platforms to increase consumer engagement. Additionally, ABFL was able to enhance the quality of our collections through the use of digital interventions.

As a result, we are more resilient, better prepared and positioned to create more value for our stakeholders. At the same time, we are focused on implementing cutting-edge digitalisation initiatives to enhance the quality of our services further.

Moving into the new fi nancial year, we witnessed a gradual normalization of economic activities due to wide availability of vaccines & a focus shift ing to live with Covid. Even though the impact of COVID-19 has declined in most parts of the World, the economic fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has increased. War-induced supply disruptions and escalating sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation led to global commodity prices spiking and remaining higher than 2021's already elevated levels. In 2022, global trade growth is projected to slow down markedly, aft er a strong rebound in 2021. Geopolitical and economic uncertainties are dampening business confi dence and investment and further weakening short-term economic prospects. The war in Ukraine was an additional push on prices that have reached new historical highs. The world economy was faced with substantial infl ationary pressures. What was initially deemed 'transitory ' infl ation, showed strength and surprised all at multi- decade highs in developed economies. The Russian invasion of Ukraine triggered unprecedented sanctions from the West causing energy prices to spike from already elevated levels on the back of resurgent demand and OPEC+ led supply control. Global infl ation is projected to increase to 6.7% in 2022, twice the average of 2.9% recorded during 2010-2020. Global food prices have surpassed the peaks of the 2007- 2012 food crises aft er relentless rises since mid-2020. Surging food infl ation is also worsening the food insecurity as it is pushing people below the poverty line in developing countries as they are still recovering from the shock of the pandemic & the supply chain disruption. Fiscal Year 2023 can once again be expected to be a period of stabilizing the economy from the eff ects of the pandemic while dealing with multiple uncertainties of the war, infl ation, debt-ridden economies, and government policies & economy stabilizing activities are going to play a key role in providing the necessary stimuli to the economy in the upcoming fi nancial year. OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY Aft er a 6.6 per cent contraction in FY 2020-21, the Indian economy rebounded to 8.9 per cent in FY 2021-22 as per the second advance estimates released by NSO. The strong Delta wave in the beginning of the fi scal had a signifi cant negative impact on growth in the fi rst half of the fi scal. While economy has shown steady recovery from Q2 FY22 onwards, it has largely been a K shaped recovery with informal and contact intensive sectors lagging and industrial sector and agriculture doing much better. The Omicron wave in early 2022 also impacted growth, although to a much lesser extent than the Delta wave. Falling infections, rapid vaccination coverage and quick normalisation of mobility have facilitated the recovery in economic activity in India over the last year. Rural demand has remained resilient while urban demand has also recovered with pent-up demand supporting the recovery in contact-intensive sectors. Private consumption sentiment have been weak. However, recovery has moved much further in industrial sector, construction and exports. Infl ation also rose in India in line with rest of the world, but largely remained within the RBI tolerance band. Higher infl ation in India has largely been due to high commodity prices and global supply disruptions. Aft er remaining ultra-accommodative and giving preference to growth over infl ation, high infl ation has fi nally resulted in pivot by RBI giving importance to rising infl ation, although remaining accommodative. The Union Budget for FY 2022-23 was focused on growth revival, budgeting for an aggressive capex spending while setting a fi scal defi cit target at an elevated level of 6.4% of GDP. Consequently, government borrowing remains elevated. High infl ation, hawkish RBI, sharp increase in bond yields and the large borrowing program have caused a sharp rise in interest rates in India. Exports and Imports both jumped sharply in FY22 as high oil prices, demand for gold and strong global growth supported both imports and exports. India's trade defi cit rose from CAD is also expected to have widened to 1.5% of GDP from 0.9% of GDP surplus in FY21. Going forward, oil prices will be the most important variable for the Indian economy as the same impacts India's GDP growth, infl ation as well as BOP dynamics. INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS NBFCs have a competitive advantage in their understanding of regional dynamics, which coupled with last mile connectivity has empowered them to provide customized fi nancial products in a technology backed agile environment to emerge as a key player in Indian fi nancing sector. The NBFCs' credit intensity to GDP ratio has risen to 13.7% in 20211 from 8.6% in 2013 & has grown at a faster pace than the credit growth for Banks during the said period. Timely policy measures by the Reserve Bank along with liquidity support, bolstered market confi dence and reduced borrowing costs for NBFCs. As fi nancial conditions and market access of NBFCs improved, many NBFCs also adopted prudent debt recycling to pay off their high-cost borrowings for new debt at a lower cost. 1Source: RBI's Dec 2021 Publication on NBFI | The GDP is on current market price basis 27 Annual Report 2021-22 balance sheet through deleveraging, increased their provisions and continued with cautious credit growth with the support provided by regulatory initiatives. Provisions against NPAs increased during the year reflective of NBFCs bracing for a potential increase in impaired assets after lifting of the asset classification standstill. Net profits of NBFCs-ND-SI witnessed a significant improvement in the aftermath of the first wave of COVID-19 as their cost to income ratios dropped. Total expenses of NBFCs moderated during the year as interest expenses declined, due to reduction in interest burden on bank credit. Operating expenses declined during the year as NBFCs successfully reined in administrative costs by leveraging technology. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Headquartered in Mumbai, Aditya Birla Finance Limited (\"the Company / ABFL\") offers lending and wealth management solutions to a diverse set of customers. ABFL is among the top 5 premier diversified non-bank financier in India. Over the last 10 years, ABFL has proliferated upon a distinctive approach to diversify its portfolio across a wide range of customer segments, needs, channels and geographies with focus on retail and SME segments. The Company is pursuing its strategy on the following three pillars, which will drive its next level of growth. Product-suite expansion The first pillar of the Company's strategy is its product portfolio expansion with enhanced customer segmentation. Adding relevant products to cater to varied customer needs and expanding from traditional to new channels of sourcing continues to be a key emphasis point for ABFL. The Company is steadily investing in broadening its portfolio towards small ticket loans including buy now pay later, checkout financing, education loans and merchant loans. Some of the new products have grown with significant traction, e.g., the Company added 3.8+ Million customers through its buy now pay later product in FY22. The small ticket and digital ecosystem products grew ~3x in last 2 years. Deeper distribution The Company continues to accelerate investments in its infrastructure. This is done in a calibrated manner with control on both costs and outcomes and it has supported its strategy to sharpen its focus on Retail and SME segments. As a result, the Company's branch presence grew from 94 in March 2021 to 159 as of March 2022. To drive further penetration in retail segments, the Company plans to double its footprint in FY23 to nearly 320+ branches, primarily in Tier 3 and 4 markets. Our branch presence mix in Tier 3 and 4 markets has grown from 48% in FY20 to 76% in FY22. The 'ABC One Branch' strategy enables ABFL to add to its presence organically at a lower cost. Additionally, ABFL is also expanding its distribution channels and sourcing increasingly from Direct & Digital Ecosystems. The overall share of direct and digital ecosystems sourcing for the Retail segment increased from 19% in FY20 to 49% in FY22. The Company also plans to leverage the ABC and ABG ecosystem in terms of expanding outreach. Cutting-edge technology Another pillar of the Company's strategy is to leverage technology in order to make its business future ready. To that end, ABFL has consistently implemented the best technologies available at each stage of its journey. With these investments, a large part of its customer acquisition and collections during the year has been through digital platforms leading to accelerated growth. 4.1+ Million customers were acquired via digital ecosystems in FY 22. 37% of retail segment disbursements were through digital ecosystems forming 15% of the overall Retail assets portfolio. This share has grown significantly in the last few years, and we attribute our right to win in this segment due to our strong balance sheet, lowest cost of borrowings amongst peers, end-to-end agile, plug and play API tech stack, partner specific bespoke underwriting policies and product bundling for customer's overall financial needs. ABFL has initiated personal loan cross-sell on the buy-now- pay-later customers acquired through Digital Ecosystems and we plan to scale it up for further up-sell and cross-sell opportunities to derive a higher customer lifetime value. The grid alongside illustrates significant progress made by ABFL across digital vectors contributing to customer acquisition, service and process efficiencies. Looking forward, the Company is constantly evaluating emerging technologies to provide significant thrust to areas such as customer on-boarding, underwriting, servicing, collections, amongst others. Going forward, the adoption of digitalisation will help catalyse growth, scalability and efficiency.Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)29 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS The Company has made significant progress in delivering on its growth strategy and has demonstrated a strong performance track record against the key metrices.

The Learning Web - This is the umbrella initiative for all Functional learning and development initiatives, most of which are done in a virtual setting. All pre and post functional training interventions are driven through The Learning Web and a monthly calendar is circulated to all employees under THE FUNCTIONAL EXPRESS newsletter. Last year the L&D team went through a transformational shift wherein all traditional classroom sessions were given a face lift through virtual instructor led programs. These programs enabled us to cover 88% of our employees across the length Management Discussion and Analysis (Contd.)37 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSand breadth of the country giving the employees the flexibility to learn anytime and from anywhere. Additionally, with 3000+ E Learning courses and 19K+ video-based modules, 300 micro-learning modules in ABC University, our employees have accelerated their learnings for their benefit. 85% of our employees in Middle and Junior management have undergone more than 1 e-learning course in FY22. Building the right skillsets in the most challenging times was one of the priorities for the team which led to building special focus on Channel Management, Distribution Building and Team Productivity. TARA was a unique women leadership development initiative with senior women leaders mentoring young women within the organization. Productivity and profitability initiatives were executed under Functional Learning and Development for various Sales functions such as League of Leaders (for managerial capability development), FTR (to improve the proposal and CAM quality and to facilitate faster decision making), CRMC (for building risk evaluation and mitigation capability) among others. To support the Retail Branch expansion a comprehensive Day-0 Functional Induction was launched, which has resulted into a faster activation and higher productivity of new joinees, where the number of employees earning incentives within 30 days of joining has risen from 19% in FY21 to 52% in FY22. FY2023 - Way forward and outlook on domestic growth Economic activity was recovering from the ebbing of the Omicron wave when the fallout of the Ukraine- Russia conflict has overcast the near-term outlook with heightened uncertainties. Growth and inflation outcomes are at high risk across the world as well as in India. In the face of this extraordinary risk, the positive effects expected from the release of pent-up demand, especially for contact-intensive services, the government's thrust on infrastructure and capital expenditure, congenial financial conditions and improving capacity utilisation appear ephemeral. Updated forecasts indicate that headline inflation, which was expected to ease from current elevated levels as food inflation gets contained on the back of record production and abundant stocks, is now subject to a geopolitical shock. The escalation of war, continued supply chain disruptions, global financial market volatility emanating from monetary policy normalisation in major advanced economies and the evolving COVID-19 trajectory pose downside risks to growth and upside risks to the inflation outlook and could get exacerbated significantly by the intensification of geopolitical tensions. The concomitant surge in global oil and commodity prices to multi-year highs has increased risk aversion as reflected in jumps in financial market volatility and these developments could increasingly shape the economic prospects globally and for India. NBFC outlook NBFCs are expected to begin the year with sufficient capital buffers, stable margins, and sizeable on-balance sheet provisioning, while adequate system liquidity would aid funding. Nevertheless, an expected increase in systemic interest rates and asset quality issues in some segments due to the lagged impact of pandemic may act as a drag on the operating performance. The sector has been facing increased regulatory oversight and push towards convergence with banks through various measures such as scale-based regulation, realignment in asset quality classification and Prompt Corrective Action norm. The incremental impact of the notification on NPA recognition however will be moderate as the NBFCs are holding adequate provisions.

REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of Corporate Governance and adhering to the Corporate Governance requirements set out by the Act, RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India. Corporate Governance principles form an integral part of the core values of the Company. Report on Corporate Governance forming part of Board's Report for the year under review is presented separately as Annexure II. RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management is at the core of our business and ensuring we have the right risk-return trade-off in line with our risk appetite is the essence of our risk management while looking to optimize the returns that go with that risk. The Company has a robust Risk Management framework which proactively addresses risks while looking to optimize the returns that go with that risk. The Board has constituted a Risk Management Committee as required under Regulation 21 of the SEBI Listing Regulations and RBI Master Directions to frame, implement and monitor the risk management plan of the Company. The objectives and scope of the Risk Management Committee broadly include risk identification; risk assessment; risk Response & Risk Management strategy; and risk monitoring, communication and reporting with the objective to contain the negative impact of unmitigated risks on profitability and capital. The Company is exposed to various risks that are inherent to lending business. Over the years, the Company have built a strong Risk Management Framework supported by well-established policies and procedures and a talented pool of Risk Professionals. The Company was able to face the unprecedented challenges faced Board's Report (Contd.)43 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSin the previous few years and emerged stronger during these turbulent times due to some of these policies and framework. The Company faces potential risks, which can be classified as credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, market risk and IT risk. Creating awareness of the risks faced by the organization is, we believe, an important way to manage risk and accordingly, the Company makes all efforts to create an environment of risk awareness at all levels. The Company has policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, assess, monitor, and manage these risks systematically across all its lines of business. The Company continually upgrades necessary security measures, including cybersecurity measures, to ensure mitigation of cyber threats and risks. Risk management in ABFL is an independent function, in the context of separation of roles of credit origination (duty cast on the business functions) and evaluation and assessment (duty cast on the credit risk function) to ensure the independence of risk measurement, monitoring and control functions. This framework also enables business units at the operating level, with the use of technology, to identify opportunities to lend which fall within the risk appetite of the Company. The various risks across the Company are monitored and reviewed through the Risk Management Committee of the Board (RMC) - the apex body for risk management and the Executive Level Committees, which meet periodically. Some of the executive level committees are the Asset Liability Committee (managing the liquidity risk and interest rate risk), Credit Committees and Investment Committees (to approve credit proposals and investment proposals), Product Approval Committee (to approve any new product being offered), Operational Risk Management Committee (to identify, measure and monitor operational risks in the business) and IT Strategy & Information Security Steering Committee (to oversee the robustness of the IT systems and policies to manage cyber threats). Credit Committees not only approve counter-party credit exposures in line with the delegation of authority assigned by the Board of Directors, but also focus on post sanction monitoring. These Committees also review the credit portfolios, non-performing loans, accounts under watch, over dues and incremental sanctions on an on-going basis. The Audit Committee of the Board provides direction to and monitors the quality of the internal audit function and controls and also monitors compliance with observation reports of RBI, other regulators and internal & statutory auditors. 1. Credit risk - ABFL has put in place robust credit appraisal, assessment and approval frameworks for identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks embedded in the business of taking credit exposures. ABFL has an early warning monitoring mechanism to facilitate early identification of stress and mitigation thereof. The Company through its Risk Policy & Monitoring unit tracks all key components like Key financial indicators, covenants and documentation. An escalation matrix is built in to enable continuous monitoring and timely resolution. Risk Monitoring unit tracks the entire credit portfolio across all segments, including monitoring of early warning signals, identifies portfolio trends and generates portfolio level MIS, covering various credit quality indicators. Further, it independently reviews credit policies and programs. 2. Market risk - Market risk is managed through a comprehensive Board-approved Investment Policy. The Company maintains an investment book of Fixed Income Instruments, mostly Corporate Bonds / PSU Bonds and is managed through the investment policy which caps exposure to various securities through stringent trading risk limits/triggers, concentration risks and Mark to Market thresholds. 3. Operational risk - Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. While ultimate responsibility for ORM lies with the Board, the Board has delegated this responsibility to the Risk Management Committee of the Board (RMC). A dedicated Operational Risk Management Committee (ORMC) maintains oversight over ORM and provides periodic updates to RMC. ORMC in turn is supported by an independent ORM Function that is responsible for designing and deploying ORM framework and processes that help Business and Support functions for identification and management of risks on proactive basis, ongoing review of Systems and Controls through risk and control self-assessment (RCSA), timely reporting of operational loss events and near miss events and its analysis for remediation, monitoring of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) and issue and action management on an ongoing basis. ORM Function works closely with all Businesses and Support Functions to facilitate implementation of ORM processes. Since a strong risk culture is a pre-requisite for effective ORM, ORM Function also ensures on-going ORM training and awareness. ABFL during the financial year ended 31st March 2022, conducted online training to enhance the awareness of operational risk. 4. Liquidity risk - ABFL has sharpened its liquidity risk management framework. Efficient management of Assets and Liabilities (ALM) is vital for sustainable growth of business for the Company. ALCO monitors the ALM position at monthly intervals and strives to proactively review the market dynamics, capturing the signals emanating Board's Report (Contd.)44 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedfrom there and assessing the regulatory requirements to ensure stake holder value creation. The ALCO also monitors the contractual repayments of liabilities and actuarial repayment of the loans and advances to arrive at the bucket level gap between inflows and outflows. 5. Fraud risk - Risks associated with frauds are mitigated through a Risk Control Unit (RCU). RCU reviews matters relating to fraud risk through review of cases which are entered in the system. Various fraud control management activities like document sampling, property visit, verification of stock statement, vendor profile check, customer profile check etc. are established. Business continuity The Company have a well-documented Business Continuity Management Programme which has been designed to ensure continuity of critical processes during any disruption. The continual disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns tested the Business Continuity Policy of the Company. Nevertheless, it continued to operate in line with the procedures outlined in its Business Continuity Plan, which was modified to take care of the evolving situation and a Pandemic Plan was developed keeping in view the interest of various stakeholders like employees, customers, partners, distributors, etc. within the overall regulatory requirements and guidelines. As a result, the Company was able to continue to operate and serve customers while taking care of the health of their employees. The Business Continuity Plan was also supplemented with a Business Normalisation plan. This enabled the Company to resume Business Operations wherever the conditions had normalised. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the efforts will be to support an effective return to work while ensuring safety of employees, distribution partners and customers. The world seems to be moving beyond Pandemic now and all the offices of the Company have resumed normal business operations from its various locations throughout the Country. However, there is still an element of uncertainty from different Covid variants emerging globally. We continue to monitor the situation and will act in best interest of our stakeholders in case of any eventuality. In view of the increased move to digital and adoption of new technologies, there was a continued focus on Cyber Security and the Company has continued to invest in a strong Cyber Defence Programme.

The framework is commensurate with the nature of the business, size, scale and complexity of its operations with a risk based internal audit approach. The internal audit plan is developed based on the risk profile of business activities of the organization.

Corporate Governance Report (Contd.)65 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSExecutive remuneration philosophy At the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking. Our Executive Compensation Philosophy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards - including incentive programs, retirement benefit programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the long-term success of our stakeholders. Our reward programs recognize and reward executives who display initiative, deliver superior individual performance, and contribute to sustainable corporate and business success. OUR BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL Our Group is a conglomerate and organized in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences. I. Objectives of the executive remuneration program Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders. Our executive compensation program is intended to: 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis 2. Emphasize \"Pay for Performance\" by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals. II. Covered executives Our Executive Compensation Philosophy applies to the following: 1. Directors of the Company 2. Key Managerial Personnel: CFO, CS, any others CEO equivalent (ex: Deputy Managing Director) 3. Senior Management. III. Business and talent competitors We benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition to this, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are generally equitable internally and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. The additional reference points may take into account the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, recognizing the differences in levels and medium of pay. IV. Executive pay positioning We aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive pay-outs at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognize the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience while positioning our executives. We use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector. V. i. Executive pay-mix Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits. ii. Performance goal setting We aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic. Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement. Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance. Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement. VI. i. Performance measurement Annual Incentive Plan: We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We Annexure III66 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedannually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business. Long-term incentive: Our Long-term incentive plans incentivize stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as an attraction and retention tool We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicle for our executives as we believe that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests. We grant restricted stock units, as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain our executives. ii. Executive benefits and perquisites Our executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for other benefits plans commensurate with their roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group. They are also eligible for certain perquisites with each perquisite serving a clear business purpose or need. Other remuneration elements Each of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives. We limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and we do not provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives. Risk and compliance We aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as 1. Remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives 2. Uncapped pay-outs 3. Unreasonable goals or thresholds 4. Steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds Claw back clause: In an incident of restatement of financial statements due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives the remuneration received in excess of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of financial statements the executives is obligated to pertaining to the relevant performance year.

Dated on this 9th May 2022 For Aditya Birla Finance Limited Rakesh Singh Pradeep Agrawal Managing Director & CEO Chief Financial Officer 89 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS89 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL To the M embers of Aditya Birla Finance Limited REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion We have audited the accompanying fi nancial statements of Aditya Birla Finance Limited (the \"Company\"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2022, and the Statement of Profi t and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended, and a summary of signifi cant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinaft er referred to as the 'fi nancial statements'). In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid fi nancial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (\"Ind AS\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of aff airs of the Company as at 31st March 2022, and its profi t, total comprehensive income, changes in equity and its cash fl ows for the year ended on that date. Basis for opinion We conducted our audit of the fi nancial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specifi ed under section 143(10) of the Act (\"SA\"s). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors' Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the fi nancial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfi lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is suffi cient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the fi nancial statements. Emphasis of matter We draw attention to Note 70 to the fi nancial statements, in which the Company describes the continuing uncertainties arising from the COVID 19 pandemic. Our opinion is not modifi ed in respect of this matter. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signifi cance in our audit of the fi nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the fi nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.90 Aditya Birla Finance LimitedKey Audit Matter Auditors' response Allowances for expected credit losses (\"ECL\"): As at 31 Mar 2022, the carrying value of loan assets measured at amortised cost, aggregated 53,60,746.02 lakh (net of allowance of expected credit loss 1,07,482.53 lakh) constituting approximately 94% of the Company's total assets. Significant judgement is used in classifying these loan assets and applying appropriate measurement principles. ECL on such loan assets measured at amortised cost is a critical estimate involving greater level of management judgement. As part of our risk assessment, we determined that the allowance for ECL on loan assets has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes for the financial statements. The elements of estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus are the following: Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the loan assets measured at amortised cost. Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default (\"PD\"), Loss Given Default (\"LGD\") and Exposure at Default (\"EAD\") at product level with past trends; Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and probability weights applied to reflect future economic conditions; and Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address emerging trends. (Refer Note 4.1, 10 and 52 to the Financial Statements)We performed the following audit procedures: We have examined the policies approved by the Board of Directors of the Company that articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio and their business models. We have also verified the methodology adopted for computation of ECL (\"ECL Model\") that addresses policies approved by the Board of Directors, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending exposures measured at amortised cost. Additionally, we have confirmed that adjustments to the output of the ECL Model is consistent with the documented rationale and basis for such adjustments and that the amount of adjustment have been approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our audit procedures related to the allowance for ECL included the following, among others: Testing the design and operating effectiveness of the following: - completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default (\"EAD\") and the classification thereof into stages consistent with the definitions applied in accordance with the policy approved by the Board of Directors including the appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied. - completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information used in the estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages depending on the nature of the portfolio; and - accuracy of the computation of the ECL estimate including reasonableness of the methodology used to determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments to the output of the ECL Model. Test of details on a sample in respect of the following: - we tested accuracy and completeness of the input data such as ratings and period of default and other related information used in estimating the PD; - completeness and accuracy of the staging of the loans and the underlying data based on which the ECL estimates have been computed. - we evaluated reasonableness of LGD estimates by comparing actual recoveries post the loan asset becoming credit impaired with estimates of LGD; and - we evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the ECL Model and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowances by using the same input data used by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the adjustment after stressing the inputs used in determining the output as per the ECL Model and ensured that the adjustment was in conformity with the amount approved by the Audit Committee. We also assessed the disclosures made in relation to the ECL allowance to confirm compliance with the provisions of Ind AS 107. Key information technology and general controls The Company is dependent on its Information Technology (\"IT\") systems due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate manner and under controlled environments. Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data. On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the testing of the general computer controls of the key IT systems used in financial reporting was considered to be a Key Audit MatterWith the assistance of our IT specialists, we obtained an understanding of the Company's IT applications, databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment. For these elements of the IT infrastructure the areas of our focus included access security (including controls over privileged access), program change controls, database management and network operations. In particular: We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Company's general IT controls over the key IT systems relevant to financial reporting. This included evaluation of Company's controls over segregation of duties and access rights being provisioned / modified based on duly approved requests, access for exit cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being recertified during the period of audit; We also tested key automated business cycle controls and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure that were relevant for financial reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Our tests included testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materially impact the financial statements. Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.)91 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSInformation other the financial statements and auditors' report thereon The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Board's Report including Annexures thereto, Management Discussion and Analysis (\"MD&A\") (collectively referred to as \"other information\") but does not include the financial statements and our auditors' report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements, or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's responsibility for the financial statements The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.) management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditors' responsibility for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors' report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our 92 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedopinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the Key Audit Matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Chartered Accountants Chartered Accountants No. 302049E) Aditya Birla Finance LimitedReport on the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements under clause (i) of sub-section 3 of section 143 of the companies act, 2013 (the 'act') We have audited the Internal Financial Controls with reference to financial statements of Aditya Birla Finance Limited (the \"Company\") as of 31st March,2022 in conjunction with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management's responsibility for internal financial controls The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining Internal Financial Controls based on the internal control with reference to Financial Statements criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the 'Guidance Note'). These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective Company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditors' responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.ANNEXURE \"A\" to the Independent Auditor's Report (Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under 'Report on other legal and regulatory requirements' section of our report of even date) Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statement and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls with reference to Financial Statements included obtaining an understanding of Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statement, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls with reference to financial statements. Meaning of internal financial controls with reference to financial statements A company's internal financial control with reference to Financial Statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Also, projections of any evaluation of the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the Internal Financial Controls with reference to Financial Statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Independent Auditor's Report (Contd.)

The Company is among the leading well-diversified financial services company in India offering end-to-end lending, financing and wealth management solutions to a diversified range of customers across the country.The Company is one of the wholly owned subsidiary of Aditya Birla Capital Limited and the ultimate parent company is Grasim Industries Limited. The registered office of the Company is Indian Rayon Compound, Veraval, Gujarat - 362266. The audited financial statements were subject to review and recommendation of Audit Committee and approval of Board of Directors.

NOTE 2: BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) prescribed under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended from time to time and other relevant provisions of the Act and the guidelines and directives issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), to the extent applicable. The financial statements have been prepared and presented on going concern basis. The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the application of fair value measurements required or allowed by relevant accounting standards. Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosed amount of contingent liabilities. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the Company are discussed in Note 5 - Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions. The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) and all values are rounded to the nearest lakh, except when otherwise indicated. NOTE 3: PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: The financial statements of the Company are presented as per Schedule III (Division III) of the Companies Act, 2013 applicable to NBFCs, as notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA). Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported on a gross basis except when, there is an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event and the parties intend to settle on a net basis in the following circumstances: i. The normal course of business ii. The event of default iii. The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counterparties Functional and Presentation currency The financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded to the nearest lakhs) which is determined to be the functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. NOTE 4: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: Note 4.1: Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. Note 4.1 (i): Classification of financial instruments The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets' cash flows and the Company's business model for managing financial assets. The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective. The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 1. Financial assets to be measured at amortised costNotes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022107 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS 2. Financial assets to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 3. Financial assets to be measured at fair value through profit or loss account The business model is assessed on the basis of aggregated portfolios based on observable factors. These factors include: Reports reviewed by the entity's key management personnel on the performance of the financial assets. The risks impacting the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its management thereof. The compensation of the managing teams (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). The expected frequency, value and timing of trades. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account. The Company also assesses the contractual terms of financial assets on the basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 'Principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Sales that are infrequent and insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate are considered to be consistent with the business model whose objective is to hold and collect the contractual cash flows. The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.Note 4.1 (ii): Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, except in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Subsequent measurement - Financial assets measured at amortised cost A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate method (EIR). Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The amortisation is included in Interest income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. These financial assets comprise bank balances, trade receivables, loans and other financial assets. Subsequent measurement - Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Debt instruments: A 'debt instrument' is classified as at the Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent Solely Payment of Principal and Interest(SPPI). Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022108 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedinstrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method. Equity Instruments: All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. For all such equity investments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI the subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity instruments included within the Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Subsequent measurement - Items at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified at FVTPL. In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Note 4.1 (iii): Financial Liabilities Initial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include borrowings including Company overdrafts and trade and other payables. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Note 4.1 (iv): Recognition and Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Recognition: A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument, which is generally on trade date. Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced (or settled) to the borrowers. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value. All other financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Derecognition: Financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when: (a) The right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or (b) The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass- through' arrangement; and either (i) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset. Financial Liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022109 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSNote 4.1 (v): Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a) Financial assets that are debt instruments are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, and other balances b) Financial assets that are measured as at FVTOCI c) Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL d) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL. The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. To calculate ECL, the Company estimate the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument during its expected life. ECLs are estimated based on the present value of all cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial asset i.e., the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Company under the contract, and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive are discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan. The Company groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, based on the applied impairment methodology, as described below: Stage 1: 12-months ECL For exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and that are not credit impaired upon origination, the portion of the lifetime ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring within the next 12 months is recognised. Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not credit impaired For exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit impaired, a lifetime ECL (i.e. reflecting the remaining lifetime of the financial asset) is recognised. Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - credit impaired Exposures are assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. For exposures that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying amount. ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected under the head 'Impairment on financial instruments' in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On the other side, for financial assets measured as at amortised cost, ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write- off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. In terms of the requirement as per RBI notification no. RBI/2019-20/170 DOR (NBFC).CC.PD. No.109/22.10.106/2019-20 dated 13 March, 2020 on Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are required to create an impairment reserve for any shortfall in impairment allowances under Ind AS 109 and Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms (including provision on standard assets). The impairment allowances under Ind AS 109 made by the company exceeds the total provision required under IRACP (including standard asset provisioning), as at 31 March, 2022 and accordingly, no amount is required to be transferred to impairment reserve. Note 4.1 (vi): Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. Note 4.1 (vii): Write-offs The Company reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022110 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedor a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate suf ficient cash fl ows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. The Company reserves the right to recover such written off amount. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of pro fit and loss. Note 4.1 (viii): Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting: The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Hedge Accounting : The Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk as cash flow hedges. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows, and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in other equity relating to (effective portion as described above) are re-classified to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, terminated, or exercised, without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in other equity at that time remains in other equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in other equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Note 4.1 (ix): Determination of fair value On initial recognition, all the financial instruments are measured at fair value. For subsequent measurement, the Company measures certain categories of financial instruments (as explained in note 4.1 (ii) and (iii)) at fair value on each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022111 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. Note 4.2: Revenue from operations Note 4.2 (i): Interest Income: For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost (net of provision) of the financial asset. Note 4.2 (ii): Dividend Income Dividend income is recognised a. When the right to receive the payment is established which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend, b. it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and c. the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably Note 4.2 (iii): Rental Income Rental income arising from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In cases where the increase is in line with expected general inflation. Rental Income is recognised as per the contractual terms. Operating leases are leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all of the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset. Note 4.2 (iv): Fees & Commission Income Fees and commissions are recognised when the Company satisfies the performance obligation, at fair value of the consideration received or receivable based on a five-step model as set out below, unless included in the effective interest calculation: Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Note 4.2 (v): Net gain/(loss) on Fair value changes Any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss (refer Note 34), held by the Company on the balance sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain/(loss). In cases there is a net gain/(loss) in the aggregate, the same is recognised in Net gains on fair value changes under Revenue from operations in the statement of Profit and Loss. Similarly, any realised gain or loss on sale of financial instruments Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022112 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedmeasured at FVTPL is recognised in net gain/(loss) on fair value changes. Similarly, any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are disclosed in the OCI. However, net gain/(loss) on derecognition of financial instruments classified as amortised cost is presented separately under the respective head in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Note 4.3: Expenses Note 4.3 (i): Finance Costs Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial liability. Note 4.3 (ii): Retirement and other employee benefits Short term employee benefit All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include short term compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised as an expense during the period. Benefits such as salaries and wages, etc. and the expected cost of the bonus/ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. Post employment employee benefit a) Defined contribution schemes The Company makes defined contribution to Government managed Employee Provident Fund, Government managed Employee Pension Fund, Employee Deposit Linked Insurance, Employee State Insurance and Superannuation Schemes which are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employee have rendered the service entitling them to the contribution. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the Balance Sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the Balance Sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund. b) Defined benefit expenses The Company's liabilities under Payment of Gratuity Act and long term compensated absences are determined on the basis of actuarial valuation made at the end of each financial year using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gain and losses are recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss as income or expense. Obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discounted rate that is determined by reference to market yields at the Balance Sheet date on Government bonds where the currency and terms of the Government bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation. The Company presents the entire leave as a provision in the Balance Sheet, since it does not have any unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months after the reporting date. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss at the earliest of: The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costs Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022113 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements, Net interest expense or income. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, attrition rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Other long-term employee benefits Company's liabilities towards compensated absences to employees are accrued on the basis of valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company presents the Provision for compensated absences under provisions in the Balance Sheet. Note 4.3 (iii): Rent expense In case of short term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 and the lease payments associated with those leases are recognised as rent expense on a straight line basis. Note 4.3 (iv): Leases The Company as a lessee The Company's lease assets primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes right - of - use (ROU) asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short-term leases) and low value leases. For these short-term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs. The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. The following is the summary of practical expedients elected on initial application: 1. Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases of similar assets in similar economic environment with a similar end date. 2. Applied the exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term on the date of initial application.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022114 Aditya Birla Finance Limited 3. Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application. 4. Applied the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. Accordingly for all contracts as on April 1, 2019, Ind AS 116 is applied only to contracts that were previously identified as leases under Ind AS 17. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities as at 01 April, 2021 is between the range of 4.95% p.a. to 6.95% p.a. for a period varying from 1 to 10 years. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements required in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following: Identifying whether a contract (or part of a contract) includes a lease; Determining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised; Classification of lease agreements (when the entity is a lessor); Determination of whether variable payments are in substance fixed; Establishing whether there are multiple leases in an arrangement; Determining the stand-alone selling prices of lease and non-lease components. Key sources of estimation uncertainty in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following: Estimation of the lease term; Determination of the appropriate rate to discount the lease payments; Assessment of whether a right-of-use asset is impaired. Note 4.3 (v): Other income and expenses All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. Note 4.3 (vi): Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date if there is any indication of impairment based on internal/external factors. An asset is treated as impaired when the carrying cost of the assets exceeds its recoverable value. The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets, net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re flects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. In determining net selling price, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identi fied, an appropriate valuation model is used. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life. An impairment loss, if any, is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is identified as impaired. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Note 4.3 (vii): Borrowing Cost Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as a part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily requires a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur at amortised cost using Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with borrowing funds. Note 4.3 (viii): Taxes Current tax Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022115 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it becomes probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss account is recognised either in OCI or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Note 4.4: Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for the purpose of statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and cheques in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are held for the purposes of meeting short-term cash commitments (rather than for investment or other purposes). Note 4.5: Property, Plant and Equipments All items of property, plant and equipments are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss if any. The cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in Ind AS 115. Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value Depreciation on the property, plant and equipments is provided on straight line method using the rates arrived as per estimates made by the management supported by technical assessment which coincides with the useful lives of assets as specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, except for the assets specified below. The Company has used the following useful lives of the property, plant and equipments to provide depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: AssetUseful Life as Prescribed by Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013Estimated Useful Life by Company Office Computers and Electronic Equipments (including Plant & Machinery)3 Years 4 Years Vehicles 8 Years 5 Years Furniture, Fixtures and Other Office Equipments 10 Years 7 Years Office equipment 5 Years 4 Years Software 6 Years3 years (However it may vary based on tenure of license) Leasehold Improvements Over the primary period of the leaseLower of 3 Years or primary period Useful life of assets different from prescribed in Schedule II has been estimated by management supported by technical assessment. Depreciation on assets acquired / sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the Statement of Profit and Loss from/ till the date of acquisition or sale.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022116 Aditya Birla Finance Limited The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipments are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. Note 4.6: Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses if any. Intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over a period of 3 years. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as finite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. Note 4.7: Provisions and Contingencies Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. Note 4.8: Contingent Liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be con firmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an out flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the fi nancial statements. Note 4.9: Earnings Per Share The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of Company (after adjusting for interest on the convertible preference shares and interest on the convertible bond, in each case, inclusive of tax) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. Note 4.10: Segment Reporting Operating business segment results are reviewed regularly by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Business segment is the primary segment comprising of 'Financing activity'. As the Company operates only in a single business segment, no segment information thereof is given as required under Ind AS 108. Note 4.11: Dividend The Company recognises a liability to make cash to equity holders of the Company when the dividend is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, an interim Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022117 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSdividend is authorised when it is approved by the Board of Directors and final dividend is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity. Note 4.12: Business Combination under Common Control A common control business combination, involving entities or businesses in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and where the control is not transitory, is accounted for in accordance with Appendix C to Ind AS 103 'Business Combinations'. Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method as follows: The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognize new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made only to harmonize significant accounting policies. The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods are restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. The identity of the reserves are preserved and appear in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the financial statements of the transferor. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves with disclosure of its nature and purpose in the notes. NOTE 5: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. In particular, information about signi ficant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signi ficant effect on the amounts recognized in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes: Note 5.1: Business Model Assessment Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the Solely Payments of Principal and Interest and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company's continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. Note 5.2: Estimation of defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) Refer Note 4.3 (ii) Note 5.3: Fair value measurement: When the fair values of fi nancial assets and fi nancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022118 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedrisk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of fi nancial instruments. Note 5.4: Impairment of loans portfolio The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes which can result in different levels of allowances. It has been the Company's policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when necessary. The impairment loss on loans and advances is disclosed in more detail in Note 10. Note 5.5: Provisions other than impairment on loan portfolio and contingent liabilities The Company operates in a regulatory and legal environment that, by nature, has a heightened element of litigation risk inherent to its operations. As a result, it is involved in various litigation, arbitration and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. When the Company can reliably measure the outflow of economic benefits in relation to a specific case and considers such outflows to be probable, the Company records a provision against the case. Where the probability of outflow is considered to be remote, or probable, but a reliable estimate cannot be made, a contingent liability is disclosed. Given the subjectivity and uncertainty of determining the probability and amount of losses, the Company takes into account a number of factors including legal advice, the stage of the matter and historical evidence from similar incidents. Significant judgement is required to conclude on these estimates. Note 5.6: Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows of the financial instrument through the expected life of the financial instrument or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount. The future cash flows are estimated taking into account all the contractual terms of the instrument. The calculation of the EIR includes all fees paid or received between parties to the contract that are incremental and directly attributable to the specific lending arrangement, transaction costs, and all other premiums or discounts. For financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL), transaction costs are recognised in the statement of profit and loss at initial recognition.

The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company's risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk are explained in Note 52. NOTE 8.2 : DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Cash flow hedges The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from its External Commercial borrowings amounting to 1,46,367.54 Lakhs. Interest on the borrowing is payable at a floating rate. The Company economically hedged the foreign currency risk arising from the debt with a 'receive floating pay fixed' cross-currency interest rate swap ('swap'). The notional amount of swap is disclosed in the table below. The swap contract converts the cash outflows of the foreign currency borrowing as per table below to cash outflows in INR with a notional amount of 1,46,367.54 lakhs at fixed interest rate.

The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the cross currency swap are identical to the hedged risk components. To test the hedge effectiveness, the Company uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the changes in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The hedge ineffectiveness can arise mainly if there is a change in the credit risk of the Company or the counterparty. The impact of the hedging instruments and hedge items on the balance sheet are, as follows Hedging Instruments (H in Lakh) ParticularsNotional AmountsCarrying amount of hedging instruments Assets/(Liabilities)Line item in the Financial StatementChange in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness for the period 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 31 Mar 22 31Mar21 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 Cross currency interest rate swaps 146,367.54 146,367.54 (7,770.64) (3,062.55) Derivative financial instruments (3,518.78) (1,265.08) (3,063.81) (3,518.23) (1,265.72)Notes of Balance 31st March 2022121 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSHedge Items (H in Lakh) ParticularsChange in fair value used for measuring ineffectiveness for the periodCash flow hedge reserve as at 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 Foreign currency denominated floating rate borrowing 5,447.99 (1,265.72) (570.18) (2,499.94) Total 5,447.99 (1,265.72) (570.18) (2,499.94) The effect of the cash flow hedge in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is, as follows: (H in Lakh) ParticularsTotal hedging gain / (loss) recognised in OCI Hedge ineffectiveness recognised in statement of profit and loss Year ended 31 Mar 22Year ended 31 Mar 21Year ended 31 Mar 22Year ended 31 Mar 21 Foreign currency denominated floating rate borrowing 1,929.76 (1,265.72) - - Total 1,929.76 (1,265.72) - - Movements in Cash Flow Hedging Reserve (H in Lakh) As at 1 April, 2021Add/Less: Changes in fair valueAdd/Less: Deferred TaxAs at 31 March, 2022As at 1 April, 2020Add/Less: Changes in fair valueAdd/Less: Deferred TaxAs at 31 March, Value Hedge Fair value hedges hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss. For designated and qualifying fair value hedges, the cumulative change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognised in the statement of profit and loss under Net gain on fair value changes. Meanwhile, the cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as part of the carrying value of the hedged item in the balance sheet and is also recognised in the statement of profit and loss under Net gain on fair value changes. The Company classifies a fair value hedge relationship when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments.

The reserve is utilised in accordance with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Special Reserve: Special reserve represents the reserve created pursuant to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the \"RBI Act\"). Appropriation from this Reserve Fund is permitted only for the purposes specified by RBI. Capital Reserve: Capital reserve refers to difference on account of net assets taken over and purchase consideration paid for merger of wealth management undertaking of Aditya Birla Money Mart Limited with the Company and the difference on account of net assets taken over and purchase consideration paid for merger of transaction business of Aditya Birla Capital Technology Services Limited, ABCTSL (formerly known as Aditya Birla My Universe Limited, ABMUL) undertaking with the Company. Capital Redemption reserve : Preference shares of Rs. 10 Crore were redeemed at the Board meeting held on January 30, 2020. As per the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, the preference shares were redeemed out of the profits of the company and therefore a sum equivalent to the nominal amount of shares redeemed were transferred to capital redemption reserve. General Reserve: This reserve is created on account of merger. As per court order, this reserve can be utilised for distribution of dividends. Retained Earnings: Retained earnings refer to the percentage of net earnings not paid out as dividends, but retained by the Company to be reinvested in its core business, or to pay debts. Other Comprehensive Income : The Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain instruments in equity securities and debt instruments in other comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated with the FVTOCI reserve within equity. The Company transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are de-recognised.The Company uses hedging instruments as part of its management of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated on borrowings. For hedging foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. To the extent these hedges are effective, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss (e.g. interest payments).

The primary objective of the Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. The Company monitors capital using a capital adequacy ratio, which is weighted assets divided by total capital derived as per the RBI requirements. As per the RBI guidelines, Company being a Non Banking Finance Company has to maintain 15% of capital adequacy ratio. The actual Capital Adequacy Ratio is as under: Particulars 31 Mar 22 31 Mar 21 Capital Adequacy Ratio 21.77% 22.70% In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company's capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current year.No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31 March, 2022 and 31 March, 2021.

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Short-term financial assets and liabilities: The carrying amounts of cash & cash equivalents, bank balance, trade receivables, other financial assets, trade payables and other financial liabilities are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short-term nature. Borrowings Floating Rate Borrowings: Floating rate borrowings are valued on the basis of Applicable Benchmark (viz; Tenor Linked T-Bill, Repo Rate, Tenor Linked MCLR, or any external benchmark as the case may be) + Spread, if applicable. Fixed Rate Borrowings: Fixed rated borrowing are valued on the basis of valuation report shared by ICRA.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022196 Aditya Birla Finance LimitedNote 49.2: Disclosure pursuant to Ind AS 113 \"Fair Value Measurement\" The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the consideration given or received). Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method, market comparable method, recent transactions happened in the company and other valuation models. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as explained below : Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed equity instruments, units of mutual funds (open ended) and traded bonds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity instruments (including bonds) which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at the reporting period. Level 2: The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.

In cases where debt securities are not actively traded company has used CRISIL corporate bond valuer model for measuring fair value i.e. fair value has been computed using the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India ('FIMMDA') data on corporate bond spreads and such instruments are classified as Level 2. Derivative Financial Instruments : A generally accepted framework for the valuation of the swap explains the position in each leg of the swap as a 'bond'. Therefore, a receive floating - pay fixed swap can be viewed as a portfolio consisting a short position in fixed bond and long position a floating rate bond. The value of the swap is the net proceeds from such bond positions i.e. Receipt - Payment. The swaps were valued on and with inputs from the swap providers using the terms of the swap contract.Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022199 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS Equity shares measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income: Unquoted equity shares are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the net worth of the investee company and are classified as Level 3.

NOTE 52: RISK MANAGEMENT (a) Financial risk management objectives and policies The Company's principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings (Including Debt Securities & Subordinate Libilities) and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company's operations. The Company's principal financial assets include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Company's senior management is supported by a Risk Management Committee that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The Risk Committee provides assurance to the Company's senior management that the Company's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company's policies and risk objectives. The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. The Company has identified and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Company. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis. Operational & Business Risk Loss of Risk that is related to activities carried out within an entity, arising from incomplete structure, failure of systems, untrained people, inefficient products or processes. To make the structure more robust a Board Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022201 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTSapproved Operational Risk Management Framework has been put in place which is implemented by a dedicated team within the Risk Management function. A bottom up risk control self-assessment process identifies high risk areas, potential gaps and serves as an early warning system so that remedial measures can be initiated in a timely manner. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. In the case of the Company, market risk primarily comprises of interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity, other post- retirement obligations and provisions.

The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates primarily relates to its External Commercial Borrowings. The Company uses derivative instruments like forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk. The Company has taken foreign currency floating rate borrowings, which are linked to LIBOR. For managing the foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, arising from changes in LIBOR on such borrowings, the Company has entered into Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) and forward contracts for the entire loan liability and tenure of the facility. Under the terms of the CCIRS, the Company pays interest at the fixed rate to the swap counterparty in INR and receives the floating interest payments based on LIBOR in foreign currency. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual obligations. The Company manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31 March, 2022 and 31 March, 2021. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity Since the Company manages its interest rate risk on domestic borrowings by ensuring, at maximum, its long term borrowings from domestic banks at floating rate of interest and in case of reduction in interest rate, it initiates negotiations with bankers for realigning the interest rate and/or repaying the high interest rate exposures, the interest rate change in market as such doesn't affect Company's profitability materially. of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical and industry concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. The Company has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision. The credit quality review process aims to allow the Company to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action. Impairment assessment The ECL model Credit loss provisioning approach has now moved from incurred model. This forces entity to understand the significance of credit risk and its movement since its initial recognition. This model ensures (a) timely recognition of ECLs (b) assessment of significant increase in credit risk which will provide better disclosure (c) ascertainment of better business ratios. The references below show where the Company's impairment assessment and measurement approach is Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022202 Aditya Birla Finance LimitedIt is specified by RBI on credit risk management that lenders should have an internal rating framework and the lenders must have independent Credit Risk Control Units (CRCU) or equivalents that are responsible for the design or selection, implementation and performance of their internal rating systems. Accordingly the Company also have an internal rating framework developed along with CRISIL, with ratings being assigned to all the customer/ portfolio pool - (eligible customers for Ratings) and used extensively in internal decision-making. b. It is further specified in the policy that Internal rating/ grading/scoring of the borrower/client is at least Investment grade rating as per the Company's internal credit rating model or valid/live external rating. Probability of Default (PD) PD is calculated basis likelihood that the borrower will default within one year horizon (Basis for Stage 1), For Stage 2 - it is defined as significant increase in credit risk and probability is defined as borrower's probability to default in lifetime. Exposure at Default Gross exposure/potential gross exposure under a facility (i.e. the amount that is legally owed to the lender) at the time of default by a borrower. Exposure at Default gives an estimate of the amount outstanding. Loss Given Default (LGD) LGD is usually shown as the percentage of Exposure at Default that the lender might lose in case the borrower defaults. It depends, among others, on the type of collateral, it's value and the expected proceeds from the sale (e.g. sales proceeds from sales of collaterals/securities) of the assets, NPV net of recovery costs. Significant increase in credit risk a. There is significant increase in credit risk, when there is deterioration in account performance and expected resolution is not available. b. Further, for large borrowers after assessing the following Risks in totality and deterioration in each factor, it is then assessed whether there is a significant increase in credit risk i.

It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies in Note 5. - An explanation of the Company's internal grading system (Note 'Definition of default below) - How the Company defines, calculates and monitors the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default) (Note 'The Company's internal rating and 'Exposure at Default' below)\" - When the Company considers there has been a significant increase in credit risk of an exposure (Note 'Significant increase in credit risk' below) - The Company's policy of segmenting financial assets where ECL is assessed on a collective basis (Note 'Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis' below) - The details of the ECL calculations for Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 assets (Notes 'Probability of default', 'Exposure at default' and 'loss given default' below) Definition of default The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit impaired) for ECL calculations generally in most cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments. As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate. Such events include: a) Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; b) A breach of contract such as a default or past due event; c) The restructuring of a loan or advance by the company on terms that the company would not consider otherwise; d) It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or e) The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties and the customer has delay in his repayments over a month. The Company's internal rating and PD estimation process a. Internal Rating: A robust internal credit rating framework is vital for effective credit risk management. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022203 Annual Report 2021-22FINANCIAL STATEMENTSCORPORATE OVERVIEWSTATUTORY REPORTS c. Significant increase in credit risk is also gauged through Credit rating. Credit rating is an opinion of capacity of borrower to meet its financial obligations to the depositor or bondholder (i.e. lender of money) on a particular issue or type of instrument (i.e. a domestic or foreign currency: short-term or medium or long-term, etc.) in a timely manner. The rating measures the relative risk of an issuers ability and willingness to repay both interest and principal over the period of the rated instrument. i.e. rating signifies the risk of default of the borrower that is rated. Collateral Security: The Company's net exposure to credit risk, after taking into account credit risk mitigation, have been tabulated below: (H in Lakh) ParticularsAs at March 31, collateralNature of Non-cash collateralOutstandingCash collateralNature of Non-cash assets Cash and cash equivalents 59,571.14 - 151,098.56 - Bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents9,681.37 - 1,913.09 - Derivative financial instruments 19.02 - Trade Receivables 1,243.96 - 998.86 - Loans 5,360,746.02 - Refer footnote below4,759,743.36 - Refer footnote below Investments 169,403.56 - 79,290.90 - Other financial assets 5,361.81 - 5,117.95 - Total 5,606,026.88 - 4,998,162.72 - The Company by way of loan sanction letter and other loan securing documents agrees with its customers on collateral security to be provided by the customers in secured loan exposures that are subject to credit risk. Collateral security enables us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the borrower is unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations. Collateral security accepted by the Company could be in the form of: a) Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies; b) Current assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods c) Fixed asset (in the form of immovable properties - real estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment's) d) Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party); e) Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) f) Assignment of borrower's rights and interests under agreements with third parties. In addition, the Company also stipulates escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans Collateral serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default or substituting the borrower. As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction is evaluated and decided upon. The Company's processes includes verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation by technical experts where warranted. The Company accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally effective and enforceable documentation. For guarantee's taken, the guarantor's creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the transaction. The Company has collateral type specific haircuts in place which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type of collateral. The Company recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022204 Aditya Birla Finance Limitedreplace or dilute the underwriting standards the company adopts to underwrite credit exposures. (b) Forward looking Information : The Company is required to provide for impairment allowance basis expected credit loss (ECL), which is calculated using empirical portfolio performance and adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic factors, as prescribed by Ind AS. The overall provisioning made through this approach, continues to be in excess of the floor provisions as prescribed by RBI for NBFCs. The assessment of credit risk and estimation of ECL is statistically validated. It considers all relevant information about past events, current conditions and some elements of predicted performance of the portfolio. ECL has been calculated using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). In the process of determining the PD, the macro economic impact is intrinsically built in in our current approach. The overall performance through the life cycle of the loan, considers the impact of macro-economic parameters like GDP or once in events like de-monetisation etc. Most of the portfolios have seen one to two complete economic cycles and hence the default probabilities experienced by the Company takes into account the upturn, downturn and central (balanced) economic scenario. In the internally rated portfolio, the Industry rating module (sourced from CRISIL under agreement) recognizes factors like demand prediction, supply side glut / constraints, impact of imports and exports and the government policies which are more forward looking and making the through-the-cycle default probabilities to point-in-time default probability. Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis The Company calculates ECLs either on a collective or an individual basis. Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on an individual basis include: 1. Corporate Portfolio Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on a collective basis include: 1. Retail Portfolio The ECL methodology allows for individual assessment for corporates and therefore these loans are generally measured individually as each of these exposures have unique characteristics and structuring. For retail exposures and exposures which can be clubbed in homogenous pools, ECL is measured on a collective basis. This has been arrived at based on common characteristics like nature of product, customer profile etc . (c) Analysis of risk concentration Concentration analysis are presented for Portfolio pool, Location, Top borrower exposures, Group exposures etc. These are regularly analysed and presented for further review/action.

(d) Liquidity risk and funding management Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. The Company manages its liquidity requirement by analysing the maturity pattern of Company's cash flows of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Asset Liability Management of the Company is periodically reviewed by its Asset Liability Management Committee. Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31st March 2022206 Aditya Birla Finance Limited The Company maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that are assumed to be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The Company also has lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs. In accordance with the Company's policy, the liquidity position is assessed under a variety of scenarios, giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in general and specifically to the Company. Net liquid assets consist of cash. The ratios during the year were, as follows: Advances to borrowings ratios Particulars 114.83% Borrowings from banks and financial institutions and issue of debentures are considered as important sources of funds to finance lending to customers. They are monitored using the advances to borrowings ratio, which compares loans and advances to customers as a percentage of secured and unsecured borrowings.
