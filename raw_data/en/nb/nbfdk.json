She then did postdoctoral research and subsequently joined the academic staff at the University of Rochester, before returning to Canada where she is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Medicine and an Associate Member in the Department of Pathology at McGill. Research Interests: The research in her laboratory is aimed at identifying novel intracellular and molecular pathways that control the pathogenesis of chronic lung diseases associated with environmental exposures, particularly cigarette smoke. Her main focus is understanding how cigarette smoke-induced inflammation and cell death (apoptosis) are regulated. Chronic and persistent inflammation and the death of lung cells are involved in the etiology of lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is almost always caused by cigarette smoke (>90% of cases). There is no cure for individuals afflicted with COPD and there are no effective therapies that can reduce disease progression. This is due, in part, to a lack of novel intracellular targets for the development of pharmacological therapies. In this regard, her lab was the first to publish that the mere presence of a cellular receptor called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) attenuates lung inflammation caused by cigarette smoke. This was a novel finding, as the normal physiological function of this receptor, which is best known for its ability to respond to synthetic toxicants, had not previously been described. Beyond its regulation of inflammation in the lung caused by cigarette smoke, they also investigate the role of the AhR in attenuating apoptosis, a feature that is characteristic of lung tissue destruction in COPD. Using genetic, molecular and biochemical approaches, together with in vitro and in vivo models of smoke exposure, her research is focused on establishing that the AhR is a novel and important regulator of apoptosis and understanding in vivo, and the role of the AhR in preventing morphological features of emphysema in the lung. Chawki Benkelfat Professor, Department of Psychiatry Senior Scientist, Brain Repair and Integrative Neuroscience (BRaIN) Program Faculty of Medicine Dr. Benkelfat's research focuses on the neural determinants, brain circuits and mechanisms of normal and abnormal human behaviour, with an emphasis on depressed mood, anxiety and addictive behaviour. His work is concerned with etiology, and the opposition between state versus trait behaviours, with DSM neuropsychiatric disorders emerging from the former. In his lab, observations derived from human research are enriched by a complementary stream of research in animal neurobiology. His work capitalizes on the progress made with neuroimaging techniques, radioligands and positron emission tomography (PET), which permit the study of brain events and chemicals, in real time, in-vivo, in animals and/or in humans.

Indeed, synthetic formulations of cannabinoids have shown efficiency in clinical trials aiming to treat chronic and inflammatory disorders. Moreover, several widely used therapeutic interventions in chronic disease management such as acetaminophen (one of the most popular antipyretic and anti-inflammatory drugs on the market), R-profens or ketamine (potent analgesic drugs) have been found to affect the endocannabinoid system and act through it. Dr. Fritz's research within the McGill Research Center for Cannabis focuses to investigate detailed immunological mechanisms of the endocannabinoid system at steady state and during chronic disease and further explore the pharmacology of the various C. sativa-derived cannabinoids and assess their potential for clinical use, specifically aiming to; (i) investigate the molecular and cellular activities instructed by the endocannabinoid system at steady state and during inflammatory diseases including pulmonary disorders; (ii) determine the endocannabinoid-receptor mediated pathways triggered by isolated and defined phytocannabinoids; (iii) evaluate distinct phytocannabinoids using in vivo preclinical rodent models of chronic inflammatory diseases. These studies will provide a comprehensive immunological understanding of endo- and phyto-cannabinoids at steady state and during pulmonary immune challenge and develop novel cannabis-based therapies for chronic inflammatory diseases and assess their potential for clinical use. | | angela.genge [at] mcgill.ca (Angela Genge) Director of the ALS Clinic and the Clinical Research Unit at Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital | | Newfoundland-born, Dr. Angela Genge completed her medical degree at the Memorial University of Newfoundland.

His research team is based in the Neuroscience Division of the Douglas Mental Health University Institute. He specializes in the neurochemical mechanisms involved in the regulation of the physiological and behavioural responses to stressors in relation to drug addiction. | The focus of his group's research is on the brain circuitry that controls how we cope with life's many stressors. The group are primarily interested in the role played by the medial prefrontal cortex, a brain region that reaches its full development relatively late in life, that is during late adolescence/early adulthood. This brain region is interesting for several reasons. First, it controls several complexe tasks such as decision-making, planning, memory and the control of impulsivity. Second, in part because it matures slowly, the prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to a host of traumatic events which can cause it to develop abnormally and lead to a number of mental disorders. Third but not least, the prefrontal cortex plays an critical role in organizing and managing our coping responses to stressors. Interestingly, the left and right prefrontal cortex appear to control different aspects of our coping responses. His research is aimed at understanding the mechanisms by which the prefrontal cortex is activated by stressors and in particular how the left and right sides of this brain area communicate with each other when coping with stressors. | || | Dr. Hendricks' lab studies neural circuits and behaviour in Caenorhabditis elegans, a small nematode with just 300 neurons. Despite the size of its nervous system, the C. elegans brain works on fundamentally the same evolutionarily conserved signaling systems as other animals, and it is capable of sophisticated behaviour and learning from experience. The reduced scale of this system allows us to trace how changes in individual cells or neuronal connections lead to changes in behaviour. We are particularly interested in plasticity in the brain and behaviour across time scales, from short term learning to long term changes based on developmental experience to microevolutionary differences between different C. elegans strains. We use behavioural analysis, neuronal imaging, and genetics to probe the relationship between neural circuit activity, behaviour, and the environment. | | srividya.iyer [at] douglas.mcgill.ca (Srividya Lyer) Scientific-Clinical Director, ACCESS-Canada Researcher, Douglas Mental Health University Institute Clinician and Researcher, Prevention and Early Intervention Program for Psychosis (PEPP-Montreal) Assistant Professor, Department of Psychiatry | | Srividya's research and clinical interests are in youth mental health and early intervention, including for serious mental illnesses such as psychosis, in Canada and beyond.

Baglole, Fritz, Piccirillo and myself, we are studying how cannabis and cannabinoids influence innate and adaptive immune response in various pathological conditions. My main interest within this highly active group, is to study the impact of cannabinoid derivatives on the inflammatory and microbicidal functions of macrophages. A cell type with a cardinal role in innate immunity and in the regulation of various inflammatory conditions. Impact of cannabinoids on IFNg- and LPS-mediated macrophage functions is studied in culture and in animals, as well as the effect of cannabis derived molecules to confer protection against various pathogens. In addition to microbicidal and inflammatory molecules released by macrophages during innate immune response, we have developed an important interest in the study of extracellular vesicles named exosomes. These nanosized vesicles are released by any eukaryotic cells including cells of the immune system. Exosomes are now recognized for their important role in intercellular communication. We are interested to investigate whether cannabis and cannabinoids may influence their release and contents. Such study should permit to reveal how innate immunity and inflammation can be modified by these vesicles released by cannabinoids-treated immune cells bringing about new ways to treat various inflammatory disorders. | | jordi.perez [at] muhc.mcgill.ca (Jordi Perez) Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine | | Dr. Jordi Perez, MD, PhD, FIPP is an anesthesiologist specialist in pain management.

Her group uses a combination of neuroimaging approaches, such as MRI and EEG, to help characterize the underlying structural and functional mechanisms associated with these impaired processes. In parallel, we are also modeling the longitudinal trajectory of neurocognitive function and neurobiological changes that occur with short-term and protracted abstinence. More insight into the complex interplay between drug use, the brain, cognitive function, and behavior may help to elucidate novel therapeutic targets as well as pinpoint optimal windows for treatment efficacy for individuals suffering from (comorbid) substance use disorders. | | pedro.rosa [at] mcgill.ca (Pedro Rosa-Neto) Associate Professor Departments Neurosurgery and Psychiatry Translational Neuroimaging Laboratory McGill Centre for Studies in Aging Stop-AD Centre (Deputy Director) |Dr. Rosa-Neto is an Associate Professor of neurology, neurosurgery and psychiatry at McGill University, and is affiliated with the Douglas Research Centre.

How is pain affected by prior expectations and ongoing emotional states? Why do some people experience more pain than others, and why does sometimes pain seem to endure despite the absence of peripheral injury. We currently have a good understanding of the mechanisms by which noxious stimuli are encoded in the periphery and transmitted to the brain, but little is known about how those nociceptive signals ultimately cause our subjective experience of pain: the age-old mind-body problem! However, for pain this is more than a just philosophical question since an increased understanding of the cerebral mechanisms giving rise to pain could have important implications for treatment. Why do certain people seem to suffer from excruciating pain in the absence of injury? How can certain people tolerate severe pain without taking any pain killers? While certain brain structures may be, perhaps, necessary for experiencing pain, it seems that no single structure is at the same time both necessary and sufficient for pain. Rather, pain seems to emerge from large-scale interactions between several brain regions - the hallmark of consciousness. His lab is tackling these important questions using a variety of brain imaging (MRI, EGG, MEG) and psychological/psychophysiological methods (pain ratings, response times, decision-making, nociceptive flexion reflexes, skin conductance responses, facial EMG, heart rate, cortisol, etc.). His research projects also span across a more clinically-oriented axis and a more fundamental research axis. Projects with patients with chronic pain investigate topics such as the role of the central nervous system in the effects of physical exercise training on pain, brain predictors of the transition from acute to chronic pain, as well as brain markers of chronic pain and their potential relationships with other genetic and epigenetic markers of chronic pain. Projects in cognitive neuroscience investigate phenomena such as the interactions between pain and cognition, pain and emotions, the effects of music on pain, how we learn to predict and avoid pain, and how we take decisions between and competing rewards. | | stan.shapiro [at] mcgill.ca (Stan Shapiro) Emeritus Professors Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Occupational Health | | Reza.Sharif [at] mcgill.ca (Reza Sharif-Naeini) Associate Professor Department of Physiology & Cell Information Systems Group | | Dr. Sharif's lab is interested in understanding the molecular bases of mechanotransduction, and the role of mechanosensory neurons in normal and pathological pain transmission. Mechanotransduction, the process through which cells convert a mechanical stimulus into an electrical signal, is of fundamental importance to physiological functions such as our senses of touch (including pain) and hearing, as well as our ability to regulate our hydromineral homeostasis (thirst), baroreflex function and myogenic tone (regulation of blood pressure). Mechanosensitive ion channels are membrane proteins responsible for most mechanotransduction processes, yet their molecular identity has not been fully resolved. Because these channels are involved in several pathologies of the nervous (chronic pain, deafness) and cardiovascular (hypertension) systems, the molecular identification of these channels, and understanding their activation properties may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies in several clinical areas. There are three main themes: 1) Identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal mechanotransduction. 2) Defining the role of MSCs in physiology and pathophysiological conditions 3) Defining the neuronal circuits in the spinal cord and how changes in the function of these networks changes in the setting of chronic pain. | | yoram.shir [at] muhc.mcgill.ca (Yoram Shir) Professor of Anesthesia Edwards Chair in Clinical Pain Director - Alan Edwards Pain Management Unit |Following training in anesthesiology and pain medicine at Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Shir served as Director of the Pain Relief Unit at Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem prior to assuming his Chair at McGill.
