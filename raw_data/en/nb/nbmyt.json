It is based on the belief that illness can occur when the flow of life force energy known as Qi, which runs through the body in meridians or channels, become stagnant. During the acupuncture treatment, very fine sterile needles are carefully inserted into specific acupuncture points located on different areas of the body to restore the flow of Qi and in turn restore health. Scientifically, acupuncture treatment is proven to stimulate nerves under the skin and muscular tissues. As a result the body produces natural pain killer chemicals, such as endorphins, when inserting needles into acupuncture points. Some studies have shown that acupuncture has a regulatory effect on body functions by stimulating several areas of the brain. Acupuncture has been known to treat a range of health conditions. According to the [World Health Organisation (WHO)](http://www.evidencebasedacupuncture.org/who-official-position/), there are over 40 different conditions and symptoms that are treated effectively by acupuncture, including rheumatoid arthritis, nausea, TMJ, headache, menstrual pain, and lower back pain. Based on scientific evidence, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends acupuncture as a treatment for chronic lower back pain, chronic tension headaches and migraines. However, the most important benefit of acupuncture is to support your body's healing ability and restore the balance of physical, psychological and spiritual wellbeing of each individual. Traditional Acupuncture is a holistic therapy meaning rather than treating only the symptoms, it aims to treat the person as a whole by addressing the underlying imbalance and root causes of symptoms. You might not necessarily have specific health conditions, yet acupuncture can be beneficial for you as a preventive or therapeutic treatment to improve your overall wellbeing. At chi yu, before your first acupuncture session, you will receive a detailed comprehensive consultation with your practitioner. This includes the main concerns about your health as well as your general wellbeing, diet and lifestyle. Your acupuncturist will take your pulses and observe your tongue to assess the quality of your energy, so as to help determine the most appropriate acupuncture points for treating your health concern. Each session can last from 30 minutes to 60 minutes depending on the concerns and conditions. Other types of therapy, such as massage, moxibustion or cupping, may be combined with the acupuncture treatment to enhance effectiveness. After the treatment, you will be given lifestyle and dietary advice by your practitioner to enhance the benefits from the treatments. Even though you may experience some improvement after the first session, a course of one or two sessions per week for several months is usually recommended for a long term or chronic condition. If you have any questions, contact a registered acupuncturist to discuss whether acupuncture may be helpful for you and of, course, you should always consult your GP first if you have any concerns about your health. At Chi Yu Wellness Centre, we have four fully qualified and registered acupuncturists. For more information, visit chi yu's website. "}
