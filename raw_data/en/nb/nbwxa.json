For this, secondary research was adopted in which secondary data were collected through an inclusive literature review. This review consists of tourism journals, newspaper articles, blogs, World Health Organization statistics, governmental data and website materials. In early 2020, the rapidly spreading Covid-19 (coronavirus) pandemic has wreaked global disaster. With no vaccine and limited medical capacity to treat the disease is a big challenge to the world. International, national and regional travel restrictions immediately affected the tourism industry. Even war, economic downturn, terrorist attack and various other diseases are all futile to cause an absolute decline in overall (international and domestic) tourism like Covid-19. This virus has enormous impacts on the tourism industry as the most crowded tourist destinations or overtourism in the world are deserted due to shut borders, no domestic or international flights or transport systems, and mix up to deal with the biggest impact in the history of the world - Covid-19. Overtourism means an extreme number of tourists at a specific destination at a particular point of time, or the excessive spread of people at various tourist spots has led to a situation known as overtourism. Due to Covid-19, the economic consequences on many destinations will be harsh, but some destinations suffering from overtourism might feel short-term relief, but it is a big hit in the long run. Overtourism will take a back seat during the crisis. Now post-Covid-19, people will be very particular while choosing their holiday destinations; likewise, there will be a shift from mass tourism to alternative tourism. Only a few people will wish a return to overtourism. Keywords [Sharma, A.](/insight/search?q=Anukrati Sharma) and [Hassan, A.](/insight/search?q=Azizul Hassan) (Ed.)
