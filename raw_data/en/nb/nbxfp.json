People always are asking us, \"What can I do to get rid of pain?\" \"What can I do to have more [energy](https://www.druglessdrs.com/blog/increase-your-energy)?\" Then it's, \"What can I do to clean my body out?\" So where do you even start? It can be quite confusing, actually daunting. In our practice, we use a protocol from Biotics Research Corporations. You can choose to do it in a variety of ways. They have a bottle or a container of detox packs, which include 30 of them. And in those packs, which is very interesting, they have a digestive enzyme Bromelain with CLA. They have a liver support, they have an optimal EFA, and a product that's gonna help improve the dysfunction of your gut when it comes to abnormal flora. Their whole approach with the packs is to support the liver, and add oil. And you say, \"Why oil, Dr. Bob?\" Because so many of you have inflamed gut walls, and oil puts the fire out. They've developed some other proprietary blends. We happen to use either NutriClear Free, or use a fiber product and various proteins. Here's what you have to understand, your [liver](https://druglessdoctor.com/health-topics/liver/) does need protein, it needs protein to get rid of all of the different toxins. What we encourage people to do, we could do this one of two ways: - You can take a pack a day for 30 days, or - You could take three packs a day for 10 days. With the NutriClear or the fiber product, you could put a scoop of the detoxification product with a scoop of the protein of your choice, put it in your blender, blend it up, and drink it in the morning. And you can repeat the process in the afternoon. It really is simple, but it's gonna take discipline. Now, you can say, \"Why do I want to [detox](https://store.druglessdoctor.com/dr-bobs-drugless-guide-to-detoxification/) Dr. Bob?\" You may have smelly farts, you may have skin tags. You may be sweating profusely. If you have digestive distress an hour or two after you eat, you probably have [gallbladder ](https://store.druglessdoctor.com/dr-bobs-guide-to-prevent-surgery-gallbladder/)dysfunction. If you burp with cucumbers and radishes, you probably have liver/gallbladder dysfunction. Do you have a metal taste in your mouth? You probably have liver/gallbladder dysfunction. Are your stools loose? Do you have mucus in the toilet that's floating on top? That's an issue. Are you having digestive distress with certain foods? So, you can go through this process and, let's say over time, you're not feeling necessarily 100%. We've been doing [food sensitivity testing](https://store.druglessdoctor.com/fit-test/). It is amazing how many of you are sensitive to foods. And I'm beginning to see it's because of all the chemicals they're putting in this food. And we're also adding another test, which is a urine test called [MycoTOX](https://store.druglessdoctor.com/mycotox-profile-mold-exposure/) because so many of you are loaded with mold that can be quite toxic from wet homes, even to the grains of cereals that have these molds on them. We're here in Westlake, Ohio and [Naples, Florida](https://www.druglessdrs.com/florida) to create this wellness, this optimal guide to optimal health.
