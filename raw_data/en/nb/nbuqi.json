This is why we offer various mosquito, tick, and flea control treatment options - ones that best fit the needs of your yard and surrounding area. One of these options is our natural treatments for pest control. Natural Treatments for Mosquito Control - What is It? Some people may be sensitive to certain chemicals, while others have concerns about their pets. For a number of reasons, mosquito control is not a one size fits all proposition. Mosquito Joe works with several highly effective treatments, so we can always offer you the best treatment for your specific property and needs. Mosquito Joe offers [natural treatments for mosquito repellent](https://mosquitojoe.com/blog/whats-in-natural-mosquito-yard-sprays-and-do-they-really-work/) as an alternative to our synthetic treatment. The natural treatment uses powerful pest-repelling essential oils, such as lemongrass, peppermint or rosemary, and garlic to repel mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas from your property. These substances have been used for hundreds of years to repel mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. Using just the essential oils, we concentrate the pest-fighting properties these plants have evolved and harness them to make your property bite-free! When we apply the natural treatments, the essential oils are diluted in water and become a low-dose product so that your children and pets can use the yard just an hour after the treatment dries, allowing you to enjoy a bite-free yard. Natural Treatments for Mosquitoes and Ticks - How is it Applied? The natural treatment application to control pests on your property is administered through a barrier spray system. We target shrubs, plants, flowers, vegetable gardens, and areas around ponds where mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas like to rest, feed, and breed. Your Mosquito Joe will spray your property, paying particular attention to the places with mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, and gnats. While treating adult pests, we also inspect your property for active larvae populations and tackle them accordingly. Your technician will help you [learn to combat mosquitoes](https://mosquitojoe.com/learning-center/how-to-combat-mosquitoes/), allowing you to manifest a holistic approach to solving your pest problem. For example, we'll show you how to identify potential mosquito breeding grounds in your yard and recommend ways to eliminate standing water. If you are not at home at the time of your natural treatment, your Mosquito Joe technician will write up the observations made and describe recommendations for addressing them. These notes will be left on the post-service door hanger at the end of the treatment. Is Natural Treatment for Mosquitoes Effective? Our natural treatment options kill mosquitoes immediately and deter them effectively, just like our [traditional barrier treatment](https://mosquitojoe.com/services/barrier-sprays/). Options range from all-natural garlic to botanicals derived from natural plant oils and range from 14 to 21-day cycles to maintain the same effective outdoor pest control. When you schedule a natural treatment for pest control, plan for the smell of garlic or essential oils to linger for two hours. After which, you and your family will be free to enjoy your garden, pool, and patio free from blood-sucking, nasty biting pests! Why Choose Mosquito Joe for Natural Treatment?
