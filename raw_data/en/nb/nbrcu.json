I can't put myself in more trustworthy hands for healing and prevention I've recently turned to Jorga for my many (MANY) sports-related injuries. He has healed a very bad hamstring issue as well as done wonders as a regular body maintenance Ritual so that I can continue to be an extreme athlete. One should note that his treatments are not a fluffy and new age treatment. He is a healer and a problem solver, which can sometimes be an intense experience! However, he is spot on with his diagnosis and finds the very intricate soft tissues that are plaguing you, leaving you feeling loosey goosey and wonderful after. I am so grateful for you Jorga. Jorga is a real healer. I've been to a few acupuncturists, but none have been able to heal me like he can. I suffer from persistent sciatica which he has been able to treat by relieving my pain. When I leave an acupuncture session with him, I'm extremely relaxed - often times on the edge of sleep. Never have I experienced that with anyone else. I feel calm and peaceful. It's almost like how I feel after I've gotten a really good massage. I'd recommend him to anyone that needs pain relief and relaxation. Jorga is an amazing acupuncturist! I visited him three times post hip scope. I was having some joint stiffness and tightness and he took the time to figure out exactly which muscles needed healing. In addition, he helped break up scar tissue surrounding the hip joint. His diligence and skills loosed both my muscles and relieved my hip joint of stiffness. His facility is clean, professional and incredibly relaxing - felt like home after my first session! I would definitely recommend Jorga for any sports-related injury Jorga Houy is one of the best healers and acupuncturists I have ever worked with. He is able to address problems of the physical body and problems of the spirit. Compassionate and willing to work on any level with a person. He has been able to adjust his treatment according to my level of sensitivity which varies from one session to the next. I am seeing Jorga for crippling tendonitis in my wrists and his treatments are helping me very much. I would recommend him to any one for any ailment. I have a license in Chinese Medicine myself. I have personally worked with some of the most renowned doctors in our field. I have great respect for him as a practitioner. Miracle. I went to Jorga two weeks after a life-saving major surgery, because even though I was on high-dose opiate pain-killers I was experiencing severe, debilitating pain still and really struggling to simply move around my home. My whole body had shut down. Within 12 hours after my first session with Jorga, my pain level dramatically decreased, and my internal system seemed to \"reboot\". I continued to work with Jorga daily for the next five days and then for a month every few days - each time seeing a significant change in my condition either immediately or within a few hours. I cannot recommend Jorga highly enough. He is extremely experienced, 100% professional, compassionate and tenacious. He focuses on the cause of the pain, not just treating the symptoms but working to \"fix\" the real underlying issue. I was astonished at the progress I made each time Jorga treated me - he really is extraordinary. I feel sure I wouldn't be back at work and doing daily yoga just two months after surgery if I had not received treatments from him. And of course, I intend to continue to work with Jorga in the future for regular tune-ups! He is fantastic, "}
