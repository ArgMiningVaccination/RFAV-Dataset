Bos er, Jr., EdI.D.Superintendent of Public InstructionVirginia Department of Education ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Appreciation is expressed to individuals in the Virginia Department ofHealth and Virginia Department of Education who took a special interest in thenutrition grant project which produced the first edition of this manual. Sincerestthanks are extended to Doris Clements, M.S., R.D., Jane Logan, Ph.D., and MarleneCulpepper, M.S., R.D. for their advice, time, and support throughout the project andtheir many contributions which made this interagency project a reality.Special thanks are extended to Josephine Cialone, M.S., R.D., C.S., andHarriet Cloud, M.S., R.D. for their expertise in the area of nutrition and feedingdisorders of children with disabilities and chronic illnesses. They provided guid-ance for the development of the second edition of the manual.Finally, gratitude is expressed to the families of children with special needswho have taught us about the challenges and joys of this field of nutrition. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this manual is to assist school personnel to plan nutritionservices for students with special needs. The information contained in this manualwill facilitate the management of special diets and the expansion of nutritioneducation in the school curriculum. Information pertaining to the following topicswill be discussed:Common Nutrition Problems and Interventions During the SchoolDay;Dietary Considerations Related to Specific Conditions; andNutrition Goals and Objectives for the Individualized Educationand 504 Plans.Child nutrition programs operate under the National School Lunch Act andthe Child Nutrition Act of 1966. This federal legislation stipulates that in a mealpattern certain types of food substitutions may be made which will allow theprogram to remain eligible for reimbursement. In response to Section 594 of theRehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, federalregulations permit food substitutions to accommodate a student with a medical orspecial dietary need. Students with disabilities requiring special diets must have awritten order from a physician which identifies the disability, provides a statementof how the disability affects the diet, and states the dietary changes and suggestedmeal modifications. The child with special needs who is not identified as a student with a disability must have a written order from a recognized medical authority (i.e.,physician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, or other specialist identified bythe state) according to federal regulations 7 CFR 210.10.Child Nutrition Program (CNP) personnel play an important role in thehealth and physical well-being of the students with chronic illnesses and disabilities.School breakfast and school lunch programs provide nourishing meals and thecafeteria becomes a learning environment for the child with a special feeding ordietary need. Coordination between the CNP personnel, the school staff and thechild's family will ensure that the child learns about his nutrition and feeding needsand has a pleasant mealtime experience. Cooperation between the home and schoolenvironments will provide consistent support and reinforcement for a successfuldietary program.A dietary management record is available in Appendix A. This may be usedby school personnel to outline the dietary program at school, and at home forstudents with special needs. NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS I.PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONSDURING THE SCHOOL DAY - AN OVERVIEW to3 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONS DURING THESCHOOL DAY - AN OVERVIEW4 Nutrition related problems are medical risk factors for all children, but areespecially significant for children who are disabled, chronically ill or developmen-tally delayed. The inherent nature of a disability or illness places additionalstresses on a child's growth and development. Problems include inadequateintake of calories and nutrients, delayed growth, underweight or overweightconditions, dental problems and chronic constipation. Proper nutritional interven-tion may prevent, control or correct these conditions.Meeting the nutritional needs of children with special needs is a challengingtask and can be accomplished with appropriate education and resource materialsavailable to school personnel. Moreover, coordination with the families and healthcare providers of these children is essential. Typical nutrition problems, com-monly associated conditions, and suggested intervention strategies are provided.

If untreated a child with a metabolic disorder is susceptible to developing conditions whichcan lead to coma or neurological damage. Many inborn errors of metabolism require specific diets fortreatment. PKU is one of the more frequently occurring metabolic disorders.

Problems related toCP vary depending on the severity and complexity of the injury. These problemsmay include hearing and visual impairments, seizures, learning disabilities ormental retardation and nutrition problems (1).Children with CP may have multiple nutrition related health problems.These nutrition problems include the following:Feeding problems such as poor mouth closure, sucking, swallowingor chewing difficulties, and abnormal reflexes such as a bite reflex,gag reflex or tongue thrust may be present (2).Vomiting, aspiration, and refluxing may occur. ( Refluxing is bring-ing the food from the stomach into the esophagus or food pipe.)These problems may cause pneumonia when food is caught in thelungs (3).Delayed growth may be related to the severity of the muscle im-pairment, nutrition disorders and feeding problems (2, 4, 5).Dental problems including cavities and gum disease may also com-plicate feeding difficulties (2). NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 12 Constipation may be caused by abnormal muscle tone, immobility,side effects from medications, decreased activity level, and pooreating habits (2).Calorie needs for children with CP will vary according to the type anddegree of motor dysfunction they are experiencing. Spastic CP causes limitedmobility and may result in lower calorie needs. As children with spastic CP growolder, they may have problems with obesity; however, it is not uncommon to see achild with severe spasticity who is underweight. Spasticity is caused by increasedmuscle tone which may increase the child's need for calories. Children withathetoid CP have continuous involuntary movements. This extra movementcauses them to use more calories and raises their daily energy requirements (2, 3, 6).In addition, CP children with feeding problems, as described above, may useextra energy during the feeding process which will affect their calorie needs.

NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 15 CYSTIC FIBROSIS Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an inherited metabolic disorder characterized by theproduction of mucus which interferes with the function of the lungs and digestiveorgans.Children with CF are considered to be at high risk for nutrition relatedhealth problems because the disease is closely associated with the digestion andabsorption of foods and eventually affects the growth, development and health ofthe child. Nutrition problems associated with CF include:poor weight gain and growth related to problems absorbingnutrients and foods;malabsorption of fats and proteins due to an inadequate level ofenzymes to digest these nutrients;high calorie needs due to frequent infections, fevers and laboredbreathing;intolerance of lactose, a sugar found in milk and milk products,which can cause cramping and diarrhea;intolerance of simple sugars in advanced stages of the diseasewhich may develop into diabetes; andvitamin or mineral deficiencies due to poorly absorbed foods con-taining important nutrients (1, 2).22 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 16 Children with CF take enzyme capsules which replace the enzymesneeded to digest and absorb food. The capsules should be taken with meals andwith snacks. Each child requires different amounts of enzymes depending onMs/her individual needs and the content of the meal ingested. In addition tothe enzyme therapy, children with CF usually follow a high calorie and highprotein diet which may include three meals plus supplemental snacks. Severalyears ago, fat was restricted from the diet of children with CF; however, now withthe improved enzyme therapy, most children with CF can handle moderate to highlevels of fat in their diets.Fat is an important part of their diet because it provideshigh amounts of calories and essential fatty acids which are needed in the body (1, 2).RESOURCES: National Chapter6931 Arlington RoadBethesda, MD 208141-800-FIGHT Arlington RoadBethesda, MD 20814(301) 951-4422 or (800) FIGHT CF NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 17 The Power-Packed Packet.

NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 18 DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes Mellitus is an endocrine disorder in which the body is unable toproperly use sugar to provide energy for the cells of the body. It is caused bya shortage of insulin, a substance which transports blood sugar into the cells.Without adequate amounts of insulin, the blood sugar will rise to high levels.Normal fasting blood sugar levels should be less than 115 mg /dl and after ameal, blood sugar levels should be less than 140 mg/ dl. With uncontrolleddiabetes, these levels are exceeded.The two types of diabetes are Type I or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus(IDDM) which occurs in youth, and Type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetesmellitus (NIDDM) usually appears in middle-aged adults. The main differencesbetween these two types of the disease are that Type I begins abruptly withsevere symptoms which require insulin to control; whereas, Type II developsgradually with milder symptoms which can often be controlled by changing thediet and following a weight control program. This manual addresses the nutri-tional concerns for the school age child with Type I or IDDM.Early symptoms of IDDM include increased hunger and thirst, excessiveurination, weight loss and fatigue. Untreated diabetes causes more severe medi-cal problems (1). NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 19 The treatment of IDDM involves medication (insulin), self-monitoring ofblood sugar levels, exercise and diet. The diabetic diet is basically a well-balanceddiet which restricts foods containing simple sugars, controls fat sources, andprovides adequate amounts of complex carbohydrates and proteins for growthand development. The diet should be designed according to the child's age, sex,activity level, growth rate and lifestyle. Calorie levels are calculated to promotenormal growth and to prevent excessive weight gain.There are several methods for teaching children their individualized mealplan. Frequently, dietary principles are taught using an \"exchange system\" inwhich foods are grouped according to their similar calorie and nutrient content.The six exchange groups include meats, breads, vegetables, fruits, milk and fats.A meal plan of three meals plus snacks is designed with a specified number ofservings from each food exchange group. Effective control of blood sugar is bestaccomplished through even distribution of a child's calorie intake throughout theday; and meals and snacks should be eaten at regular times each day (1, 2).The diabetic diet is based on the following dietary principles:Concentrated sugars and sweets are usually kept to a minimum.These include candy, sugar, syrup, soft drinks, frosting, pastries,cookies, pies and cakes. Children with good control of their diabetes NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS may tolerate small amounts of these foods to allow some flexibilityin their diet (1-3).Artificial sweeteners provide some food options for a child withdiabetes and may be used in moderation (1-3).Fat sources should be controlled in the diabetic diet. In addition tohigh blood sugar levels, individuals with diabetes have high fatlevels (i.e., cholesterol and triglycerides) in their blood and are atgreater risk for developing heart disease in later life. To prevent orcontrol these problems, it is important to decrease saturated fats andcholesterol sources in the diet (e.g., eggs, cream, whole milk prod-ucts, butter, lard, organ meat, red meat, palm and coconut oils, etc.) (1-3).Some research shows that high fiber foods help to control bloodsugar and to lower blood cholesterol levels. Soluble fibers found infruits, legumes and oat products have this effect. A gradual in-crease of fiber is beneficial. It is generally recommended that bloodsugar levels be carefully monitored when making these dietarychanges (1-3).Snacks are an important part of the diet for many young childrenwith diabetes. The timing of the snacks depends on the child's meal2720 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 21 pattern; the schedule of insulin injections; and the child's exercisepattern. Snacks should be eaten at scheduled times. Extra snacksmay be needed prior to vigorous or prolonged exercise (1, 2).Nutrition education is an essential part of the health care for the child withdiabetes. Nutrition goals for the student with diabetes are 1) to control blood sugarlevels, 2) to achieve normal growth and development, and 3) to follow a well-balanced program incorporating diet, self-monitoring of blood sugar levels, medi- cation and exercise (1-3).

Character-istics of Down Syndrome are listed below:Mild to moderate mental retardation may cause delays in feedingskill development. Children with Down Syndrome may need ther-apy and training to attain independent feeding skills (1, 2).Low muscle tone may interfere with sucking, swallowing andchewing, and may also contribute to problems with constipation (1, 2).Growth retardation and low muscle tone causes these children to beat risk for obesity (1-5).Growth charts for children with DownSyndrome, ages one month to 18 years, have been designed for moni-toring their height and weight (3, 4).Delayed dental development, structural differences of the mouth,and gum disease may interfere with feeding. Textural changes offoods may help the feeding process (1, 2).Congenital heart disease may affect the nutritional needs of the child.Increased calories are often needed until corrective surgery isperformed or the heart condition is stable (2). NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 24 Nutrition services are important for children with Down Syndrome forassisting with the monitoring of growth, adjusting calorie needs and helping withfeeding skill training.

Symptoms of JRA mayinclude inflammation, heat, pain, swelling and stiffness in one or more joints.There may be periods of disease activity when children have mild to severesymptoms and periods of remission when they are symptom-free (1-3).There are many fad diets and folk remedies promising quick relief andcures. These diets and remedies offer false hope for those who live with arthritis.Specific nutrition problems which need to be evaluated in children with JRAinclude the following:Poor weight gain is related to many factors such as fevers andinflammation which increase the child's calorie needs. Side effectsfrom medications may decrease appetite. If there is arthritis in thejaw, chewing may be painful, and the child may develop fatiguewhile eating and refuse food (4, 5).Growth failure may be caused by the factors mentioned previouslyand may be compounded by periods of inflammation or by steroidmedications which can impair growth (4, 5). In general, childrenwith JRA are smaller and leaner than their healthy counterparts.32 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 26 Anemia in children with JRA may be related to disease activityrather than to iron deficiency states (2, 3, 5).Side effects such as vitamin deficiencies, stomach upset, indiges-tion, altered taste, increased or decreased appetite levels, and waterretention caused by medications may result in problems for chil-dren with JRA. Many of the medications need to be taken with foodor milk to avoid stomach upsets (3). (Refer to Appendix E. JuvenileRheumatoid Arthritis: Diet and Drugs.)Obesity may be a problem for a small percentage of children withJRA. This may result from overeating, limited activity levels, orwater retention and increased weight gain from steroid medications (2, 5).Many factors put the child with JRA at risk for nutrition related healthproblems. Routine nutrition evaluations and dietary counseling are an importantpart of their health care. $53 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 27 NUTRITION EDUCATION MATERIALS:Arthritis Information Children (#4141)Diet Answers questions about the role of diet in arthritis (#4280)The Arthritis FoundationP.O.

Proteins are made ofbuilding blocks called amino acids. Phenylalanine (PHE) is an amino acid. A childwith PKU cannot process the PHE found in protein foods, and as a result, PHEbuilds up in the blood stream. Normal blood levels of PHE are within the range of4 to 10 mg/ dl. All children need a certain amount of PHE for growth. When a childwith PKU has elevated PHE levels he may appear restless and have a short atten-tion span.High levels of PHE over a long period of time can cause seriousproblems. If left untreated, PKU can prevent normal brain development and resultin mental retardation.PKU is usually diagnosed at birth through a simple blood test which is partof a routine screen on all newborns. The treatment for PKU is a low PHE diet.Through good dietary control mental retardation will be prevented, and the PKUchild can grow and develop normally.The PKU diet is a low PHE diet and the basic principles are described below:High protein foods are not allowed. These include milk, cheese, eggs,meat, fish, chicken, peanut butter, beans, nuts and ice cream.Products containing Nutrasweet\u00ae or aspartame are not allowed.Nutrasweet\u00ae contains PHE. NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 29 Medium protein foods are allowed in controlled amounts. Theseinclude fruits, vegetables, fruit/vegetable juices, breads, cereals,crackers, popcorn and special low protein commercial products.Certain \"free foods\" (foods that do not contain PHE) are al-lowed to provide calories and variety in the PKU child's diet.These foods include soft drinks, lemonade, jelly, gum candy and popsicles.(Refer to Appendix G. Phen-ylketonuria (PKU) Diet: Free Food List.)Special formulas are used to provide the main source of caloriesand protein in the diet. These formulas are made without PHE.Examples of these formulas include Phenyl-Free\u00ae, Phenex\u00ae Periflex\u00ae.Each child with PKU has a special diet prescription which gives instructionson how much formula must be consumed and how many milligrams of PHE isallowable each day. As the child with PKU grows, the diet should be adjusted andbased on age, growth and PHE levels.Each child with PKU should have a diet prescription on file at schoolexplaining what foods are allowed and the meal pattern to be followed. Somechildren with PKU will bring to school their formula and a packed lunch. Othersmake selections from the school lunch and supplement this with formula.6 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 30 Depending on the age of the child, assistance and/or supervision may be neededat mealtime in selecting appropriate foods. The school lunch can provide an excellentopportunity for nutrition education for the student with PKU; otherwise, the childwith PKU should function as a normal, healthy student in the classroom (1, 2).

NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 32 SEIZURE DISORDERS A seizure is a sudden, involuntary, time-limited alteration of neurologicalfunction. Most seizures have no identified cause, but they may be part of adisability or the result of an injury to the brain. Seizures are usually brief, lastingonly seconds or minutes. They result in a disorganization of one or more brainfunctions causing a change in behavior, muscle tone, speech, mood or level ofawareness. There are many different types of seizures. Epilepsy is a term whichidentifies a chronic condition in which the individual has recurring seizures (1).The primary nutrition problems of children with seizures are related tothe side effects of their anticonvulsant medication and the interaction of thismedication with foods. These side effects depend on many factors such as thelength of time the drug has been taken, combined interactions with other medica-tions, and the child's general nutritional health. Certain anticonvulsants causedrug-nutrient interactions which include:changes in appetite levels;low levels of folic acid in the blood;interference with vitamin D activity which can lead to low levels ofcalcium in the blood and decreased bone mass; andswollen or tender gums which may interfere with feeding (1, 2). NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 33 In very specific cases children with seizures may be prescribed a ketogenicdiet for the treatment and control of seizures. Usually this diet is prescribed forchildren with poorly controlled seizures who cannot tolerate the side effects oftheir seizure medicine.The ketogenic diet is designed to maintain a state of ketosis which happenswhen the body relies on fats as a source of energy and produces compounds calledketones. Ketosis has been found to improve seizure control in certain cases. Thediet is very high in fat and low in carbohydrates. It is a carefully calculated diet andrequires daily monitoring to maintain ketosis. A child on a ketogenic diet shouldbe followed by a registered dietitian and have a prescribed meal plan to followdaily. This meal plan should be on file at the school. Coordination between thechild's family, the neurologist, the dietitian, and the school is recommended (1, 3).

In normal developmentthe spinal cord forms in a column along the back and is surrounded by membranesand the bone of the spine. In spina bifida, membranes form a sac on the back.The spinal cord grows into this sac and spinal nerves below the sac are not properlyconnected to the spinal cord and brain. As a result, there are many problems whichmay develop. The type and severity of these problems vary depending on the sizeand location of this sac and the presence of hydrocephalus (fluid on the brain) (1,2). Certain types of this birth defect are now considered preventable if folic acid issupplemented in the mother's diet prior to conception (2).Nutrition related health problems which are often seen in children withspina bifida include the following:Obesity is a common problem for children with spina bifidabecause they are often short for their age, and they have a limitedactivity level which results from partial or complete paralysis intheir lower body. Children with spina bifida have lower calorieneeds than other children their age which interfere with weight control (1, 4).42 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 36 Feeding problems may occur due to a malformation of a part of thebrain called the Arnold Chiari malformation. It may cause swallow-ing problems and reflux (1, 2, 4).Urinary tract infections (UTI) are frequent problems. Approxi-mately 95% of children with spina bifida do not have control oftheir bowel or urinary bladder because nerves controlling thesefunctions are impaired. To prevent UTI, children with spina bifidamay be instructed to drink extra fluids and to maintain an acidicurine with prescribed medicines and diet (1-4).Bowel management is a problem for children who may not be ableto feel that their rectum is full or that they are passing a stool. Bowelmanagement programs are designed to prevent and treat bowelaccidents through a combination of diet, toileting habits and medi-cation (1, 3, 5). (Refer to the section on Constipation.)Skin care is especially important for persons confined to a wheel-chair because pressure sores may develop on the skin. If a childwith spina bifida has no feeling in his lower body a sore can developand become infected without the child seeing it or feeling the pain.A well balanced diet is needed to keep skin healthy and to help thehealing process (1, 4).43 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS RESOURCES:37 Spina Bifida Association of America4590 MacArthur Boulevard, NWSuite 250Washington, DC 20007(800) 621-3141 NUTRITION Fruit, Veggies, and Water (booklet)MCH /WIC Nutrition ServicesDivision of Maternal and Child HealthNorth Dakota Department of Health600 East Boulevard AvenueBismark, ND 58505-0200(701) 328-2493Family Education Series on Nutrition for Childrenwith Special Health Care Needs:(1) Fluid Needs(2) Relieving ConstipationCivitan International 313Birmingham, AL 35294-0017(205) 934-5471 44 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS REFERENCES:38 1.Brizee, L.:Nutritional concerns associated with spina bifida.

Constipation may be characterized by hard, dry stools which are difficult orpainful to pass; infrequent bowel movements; and/or, the passage of small amountsof stool daily without completely emptying the bowel. Constipation may becaused by one or a combination of factors including:lack of dietary fiber and fluids;abnormal muscle tone (i.e., low tone or spasticity);decreased or significantly altered physical activity level;irregular bowel patterns or toileting habits;behavioral problems such as anxiety or tiredness which mayinterfere with regular bowel patterns;medical conditions causing lack of sensation in the rectum sothat the child cannot feel that the rectum is full (i.e., spina bifida,imperforate anus, spinal cord injury, etc.); andside effects of medication (1-3).A successful bowel management program to prevent and/or treat bowelaccidents and constipation usually includes a combination of diet, toileting habitsand medications.The dietary recommendation for preventing constipation is to increase fiberand fluid in the diet. Fiber (roughage) is a non-nutritive substance found in foods46 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 40 which is not digested in the small intestine. Fiber absorbs water and helps to forma larger, softer stool for easier passage through the bowel. It also increases themovement of food through the intestines (3). Fiber and fluid may be added to thediet through a variety of ways depending on the child's feeding skills. Foods witha high fiber content should be incorporated into each meal. Because there is awide variety of high fiber foods, different textures are available and should beselected according to the child's oral-motor skills.If a child is unable to manage high fiber foods, unprocessed wheat bran maybe added to the diet by mixing it with foods. Wheat bran should be introduced insmall amounts and gradually increased in the diet. A good starting point is oneteaspoon per day which is slowly advanced or one or two tablespoons daily whilemonitoring the child's stool pattern. For the best results, the unprocessed wheatbran should be added to food throughout the day, and fluids should also be increased (1-3).Liquids and/or high fluid foods should be offered frequently during theday. Nutritious fluids such as water, fruit juice and milk are recommended (1-3).Sometimes milk and milk products may cause problems with constipation. If thishappens, milk should be used in limited amounts (i.e., approximately 16 ouncesdaily). Fluids may also be present in the form of foods such as fruit popsicles,fruits, yogurt, pudding and gelatin.47 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 41 NUTRITION EDUCATION MATERIALS:Booklet on Bowel ManagementPatient Education CenterMedical College of VirginiaMCV 828-2139Fresh Fruit, Veggie and WaterMCH/WIC Nutrition ServicesDivision of Maternal and Child HealthNorth Dakota State Department of East Boulevard AvenueBismarck, ND 58505-0200(701) 328-2493Management of Constipation Avenue, NorthBirmingham, AL 35234Attention: Tina Shaddix, R.D.(205) 251-0165Family Education Series on Nutrition for Children withSpecial Health Care Needs(1) Fluid Needs(2) Relieving ConstipationCivitan International 313Birmingham, AL 35294-0017(205) 934-5471 MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE SPECIAL NEEDS REFERENCES:42 1.Feucht, S., ed.:Constipation.

Feeding abnormalities aremore frequently identified in children with Down Syndrome, cerebral palsy, spinabifida and developmental delay.There are many factors which make the feeding experience successful andenjoyable. These include the coordination of the tongue, jaw and lips to chew andswallow foods; proper positioning to provide support for the head and body;and the progression of age-appropriate feeding skills for independent self-feeding.In addition, the feeding environment should be relaxing and pleasant so that thechild may focus on the task of eating, and enjoy the socialization of the feeding ex-perience (1-4).Feeding abnormalities include the following problem areas.An exaggeration of a normal feeding skill: -tonic bite reflex- tongue thrusttongue retractionhyperactive gag reflex NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 44 A delay in the normal progression of feeding skills: -inability to grasp food or to finger feeddifficulty in cup drinkingdifficulty using a spoonPoor coordination of the jaw, lips and tongue for swallowing andchewing:poor lip closurepoorly controlled tongue movementspoor chewing patternInability to sit independently in an upright position:poor head controlpoor trunk control- involuntary movementsProblem behaviors at mealtime:mouth stuffingrumination (the act of bringing food from the stomachinto the mouth to chew again)defensiveness during feedingsfood refusalself-abusive behavior -inability to stay on task- prolonged feeding periods 51 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 45 Many of these problems will prevent a child from consuming adequateamounts of calories and nutrients; therefore, children with feeding abnormalitiesare at risk for poor growth and malnutrition.Children with feeding abnormalities need feeding and nutrition evalu-ations to identify and correct the specific problems through appropriate interven-tions. This is best accomplished by a school-based feeding team which may becomposed of an occupational therapist, speech therapist, physical therapist, psy-chologist and nutritionist.Input from the child's parent and teacher is alsoessential. The evaluation should include a review of motor skills or patterns whichinterfere with or enhance feeding; positioning at mealtime; sensory patterns whichshow defensive or receptive behaviors at mealtime; oral-motor skills whichcontrol chewing and swallowing; and, the feeding environment. Recommenda-tions should be made about the amount of calories a child needs for growth anddevelopment.Textural modifications of foods may be needed to aid in thedevelopment of a child's chewing and swallowing skills (Refer to Appendix D.Textural Modifications.) Special equipment may be ordered for the developmentof self-feeding skills and proper positioning of the child. These recommendationsshould be integrated into a plan to enable the child to 1) receive adequatenourishment for a well-balanced diet, 2) develop self-feeding skills and, 3) enjoythe social interaction of the feeding experience (1-5).52 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 46 NUTRITION EDUCATION MATERIALS:Oral-Motor Development and Feeding 1986 (brochure)United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Birmingham, Inc.2430 11th Avenue, NorthBirmingham, AL 35234Attention: Tina Shaddix, R.D.(205) 251-0165Clinical Management of Gastroesophageal Reflux A Guide for ParentsChildren's Hospital and Medical CenterOccupational Therapy DivisionP.O.

NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 48 TUBE FEEDINGTube feeding is an alternative route of feeding when feeding by mouth isinadequate or unsuccessful and the gastrointestinal tract is functional. Somechildren are not able to meet their calorie needs for growth and development bytaking food only by mouth. Other children are unable to eat or swallow safely dueto problems with reflux (the action of bringing food from the stomach into theesophagus or food pipe); aspiration (inhaling food into the lungs); or, neuro-logical disorders which may interfere with the development of safe and effectivefeeding and swallowing skills. For nourishment and growth, these children re-quire feeding tubes to transport energy, nutrients and fluids into the stomach orintestinal tract (1-3).There are several types of tubes and routes of feeding. Three of the morecommon types of tubes are defined below:Nasogastric (NG) Tubeis a small flexible tube which is passed from thenose through the throat and into the stomach. This tube is usually selectedfor short term or temporary use for tube feeding.Gastrostomy (G) Tube - is a rubber-like tube that is surgically placedthrough the stomach wall into the stomach. It delivers fluids and formuladirectly into the stomach. When a gastrostomy tube is put in place, aprocedure called a Nissen fundoplication is sometimes performed todecrease problems with refluxing. This is a surgical procedure in whichI.5 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 49 tissue from the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower endof the esophagus. This creates a smaller opening to prevent food from beingbrought up from the stomach into the throat. If a child has this procedure,problems with gas building up in the stomach may occur. This can berelieved by releasing air from the tube. A gastrostomy is used for long termtube feeding, but it may be removed if the child becomes able to consumecalories and nutrients safely and effectively by mouth and can sustainoptimal growth.Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) is a modified prodedurefor the placement of a gastrostomy tube into the stomach (1).Button - is a type of feeding device which is used to replace the G tube. Thebutton is a T-shaped plastic device which is placed in the opening of thestomach wall to replace the G-tube. It is shorter than the G-tube and is lessnoticeable under clothing. The button is inserted by a surgeon and remainsin place at all times. When feedings are given a tube is inserted through thebutton and into the stomach. When feedings are finished, the tube isremoved and the button is capped (1).When a child is fed through a tube over a long period of time, carefulconsideration should be given to feeding skill development and oral-motor stimula-tion. Children should learn to associate the feelings of fullness with oral stimulationby using a pacifier or therapeutic exercises during feeding. This feeding programU. NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 50 should be developed with the child's occupational or speech therapist (2, 3).Tube feedings may be administered by two methods, bolus or drip. Abolus feeding is poured into a large syringe which connects to the feeding tube.The flow of the formula is controlled by the size of the tube, the height of thesyringe and the thickness of the formula. A drip feeding is administered using acommercial feeding pump. The formula is released into the tube by regulatinga clamp on the tube. This provides for controlled feedings which may be admini-stered for specific periods. Depending on the child's needs and the type of formulaselected, a drip method can be regulated to provide large volumes of formula overa long period, or to provide a very slow administration of formula (1-3).Intermittent feedings may be administered over a 20 to 30 minute period atscheduled intervals during the day, much like meals. Other children requirecontinuous drip feedings administered 16 to 24 hours throughout the day. Somechildren will receive continuous tube feedings for 8 to 12 hours at night while they sleep (1).Tube feeding formulas should be selected based on several factors. Theformula should provide adequate nutrition in the form and volume that the childcan tolerate; it should be prepared and administered with ease and under hygienicconditions; and, it should be affordable for the family. A tube feeding formulamay be homemade from a blenderized recipe or it may be a commercially preparedproduct (2, 3). Potential problems with a blenderized recipe include inaccurate57 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 51 mixing of the formula which will alter the nutrients and calorie content of the diet;separation of the semi-solid ingredients from the liquid portion of the formulawhich will clog the tube; and increased risk of contamination from improperhandling and sanitation in the preparation, transport and storage of the formula (3).To prevent these problems, it is preferable to use a commercially prepared productfor at least the portion of the feeding administered at school. These products areavailable in ready-to-feed cans which are easy to handle and to store away fromhome.Frequently, vitamin/mineral supplements are prescribed with tube feed-ings. These supplements are usually given at home. Fluid is a very importantcomponent of the tube feeding. Specific calculations are used to estimate the fluidneeds of a child. Fluid needs are increased during hot weather, periods of fever orepisodes of fluid loss from vomiting or diarrhea. Extra fluid may be added to theformula or may be used to flush the tube (2). When a tube-fed child is enrolled inschool, instructions should be given for attending to the child's fluid needs. Schoolpersonnel should also monitor the child for signs of dehydration.Complications from a tube feeding can usually be avoided or resolvedwith proper formula selection, careful administration of the formula and monitor-ing of the child's tolerance. Appendix F: Complications of Tube Feeding de-scribes possible problems and solutions. Whenever a problem is identified, thechild's parent and physician should be notified.

The IEP is designed toensure that each student with a disability is provided special education and relatedservices appropriate to his /her learning needs. It sets forth in writing a commit-ment of resources which are necessary to enable these students to benefit fromspecial education and related services. Further, it is a communication tool toensure that all service providers have knowledge of the student's academic prob-lems and the services to be provided. In addition, the IEP establishes a systemby which families of students with special needs work as part of an interdiscipli-nary team to develop health related services.The IEP includes annual goals, short-term objectives and a schedule forevaluation.It is to be reviewed periodically and its provisions revised, whenappropriate. A meeting must be held, at least once a year, for this purpose.Participants in the meeting shall include a representative of the local schooldivision, other than the child's teacher, who is qualified to provide or supervisethe provision of special education, the child's teacher, one or both of the child'sparents, the child when appropriate, and other individuals at the discretion ofthe parents or the local school division. For example, a nutritionist may beinvolved when a nutrition problem is identified for a child with special needs.61 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 55 The IEP provides an ideal tool for integrating nutrition education into the schoolcurriculum.It is important to note that every student with a chronic illness may not belabeled disabled and, therefore, would not have an IEP. Special consideration isneeded to ensure that resources and services will be provided for chronically illchildren with special nutritional needs or feeding problems. For example, astudent with diabetes will require special dietary considerations during the schoolday. Nutrition services should be available to this student through a 504 accom-modation plan. Feeding or nutrition modifications would be considered \"neces-sary accommodations\" for a chronically ill child.Incorporating nutrition goals and objectives into the education programwill facilitate the delivery of services to improve the nutritional status of childrenwith special needs. These goals and objectives will facilitate instruction on dietaryneeds and compliance.An outline of IEP goals and special considerations for writing objectives forchildren with nutrition or feeding problems is provided. This is followed bycase studies which describe children with special nutritional problems. Examplesof IEP nutrition goals and objectives which may be incorporated into their educa-tion plan are included.

They are not intended to be guidelines for everystudent on these particular diets. Each child should have an individualized mealplan. The child's parent and/or physician should be contacted to clarifyany questions about the diet. 83 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 77 APPENDIX B 1.LOW CALORIE DIETThe following low calorie menu adaptations would be acceptable for anoverweight or obese student. Each child has individual calorie needsaccording to his/her height, weight, age and activity level. The modifiedmenus presented below are possible suggestions. They are not standards tobe used for every overweight child.

Calories may beincreased by adding proteins, carbohydrates or fats. Experiment withdifferent combinations of food and calorie booster ideas to determine whatis well accepted by each individual student.Original pineapple 3 tablespoonsof powdered milk addedLasagna with extra cheeseRollTossed salad with extra dressingChilled pearsWhole milk blended withpureed fruit* A simple way to increase calories at mealtime is to add extra margarine to the meat,bread, soup or vegetables.85 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 79 APPENDIX B3. HIGH FIBER DIETThe following menu modifications show substitutions that can be easily made to increase the fiber content of the diet. Many high fiber foods are difficult to handlefor children who have chewing or swallowing problems. Care should be taken tooffer food that is appropriate for the child's feeding skills. If a child receives onlystrained or pureed foods the best way to increase the fiber content is to useunprocessed wheat bran mixed in or sprinkled on foods in controlled amounts.Remember that when fiber is increased, fluids should also be beansFresh peachWhole milk* When unprocessed wheat bran is added to recipes it should be used in limitedamounts.86 NUTRITION MANAGEMENT OFSCHOOL AGE CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS 80 APPENDIX B 4. DIABETIC DIETThe following menus are examples of lunches that are possible substitutions fordiabetic students. Each diabetic student should have a diet order from a physi-cian which includes a meal plan and the number of snacks needed.
