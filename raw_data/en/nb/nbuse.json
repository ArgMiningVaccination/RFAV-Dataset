The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:18 a.m., in room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Dan Burton (chairmanof the committee) presiding. Present: Representatives Burton, Gilman, Morella, Davis, San- ford, Hutchinson, and Staff present: Binger, staff director; Daniel R.

Mr. B URTON . The committee will come to order. We have a Republican conference going on at this time and we 'll probably have Members coming in and out. I was going to wait onthem, but because we have a number of witnesses that have timeconstraints, I thought we would go ahead and get started. A quorum being present, the committee will be called to order. I ask unanimous consent that all Members and witnesses writtenopening statements be included in the record and without objec-tion, so ordered. Today, we continue our inquiry into American 's access to com- plementary and alternative medicine. Alternative medicine con-tinues to increase in popularity and use in the United States. A1997 survey in the Journal of the American Medical Association re-vealed that over 42 percent of Americans used at least 1 of 16 al-ternative therapies during the previous year. Last year, we looked primarily at the research area. We focused on the ability of seriously ill patients to get access to FDA-approvedclinical trials in alternative medicine. This may be a relatively VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May of the overall population, but it is one that is des- perately in need of our help. There are millions of Americans who are suffering from terminal or crippling diseases. For many of them, conventional treatmentslike chemotherapy do not work, or may be fatal themselves. Forthese people, alternative drugs and therapies are the only ray ofhope that they have. I believe in my heart that we have an obliga-tion to those people to invest the money that 's needed into research and clinical trials to find out which treatments work and whichones do not. I believe that if someone is seriously ill and wants totry an experimental drug that safety has been established, the Fed-eral Government has no business in blocking them. After all, it 's their life. I have a special interest in this area because of how my own fam- ily has been affected in just the last few years by cancer. Last Sep-tember and October, I lost both my mother and my father to lungcancer. My wife struggled through breast cancer 5 years ago, andthanks to an experimental alternative cancer treatment, she hasbeen in remission for 5 years. One of the things that has reallytroubled me over the past 5 years is this experimental programwhich has been so effective in helping my wife. The Food and DrugAdministration, because of technicalities, tried to close the programdown. I had about 70 women calling me who were crying on thephone and very upset because the last ray of hope they had wasDr. Springer 's alternative therapy which stimulated the immune system. We had to literally have a real hard talk with the Food andDrug Administration because they were not going to relent. Fortunately, they did review the situation, the problem was solved and the program has been ongoing. So those 70-some womenwho are in this experimental program are still happy and they aredoing well, but it is unfortunate that you have to fight for a pro-gram like that when so many lives depend on it. I'd be willing to bet that every member of this committee has lost a family member to cancer, heart disease, or some other serious ill-ness. There is not anyone in this room whose family has not beentouched by cancer, heart disease or some other devastating disease. Last year, we began looking at the level of funding for alter- native medicine cancer research through the National Institutes ofHealth. We learned that less than $20 million of the $2.7 billionthat is the budget for the National Cancer Institute, was devotedto research in alternative medicine. This is less than 1 percent oftheir total budget, and I think that 's deplorable. This year, we are expanding our investigation to include patient access to alternative medicine through Government-funded healthprograms. Between 25 and 40 percent of Americans receive at leastpart of their health care through federally funded programs. Thisincludes our active-duty military, veterans, and their families. Italso includes Americans who receive medical care through Medi-care, Medicaid, public health clinics, and Indian Health Services. Are research results translating into access to alternative treat- ments by the average American? Well, the Health Care FinancingAdministration estimates that national health care expendituresfor the United States will double by the year 2007 to exceed $2.13trillion. Almost $1 trillion of those estimated dollars will be public VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May is imperative that the Government reduce these healthcare costs while working to improve the health and wellbeing of the American people, and that 's where alternative therapy comes in. With the epidemic-level increases of chronic conditions such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, arthritis, asthma, and depression,as well as the high percentages of cancers such as lung cancer,breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and melanoma, wehave to be aggressive and open-minded in looking for additional op-tions in medical care. We have to find effective and efficient waysto treat chronic and debilitating illnesses. We have to find betterways to treat pain. We have to find ways to reduce the use of anti-biotics. We just read the last week that many strains of viruses arebecoming resistant to antibiotics, and so there has to be alter-natives looked at very, very thoroughly. We have to find betterways to treat pain. We also need to better care for the terminallyill. We need to integrate the wisdom of the ages with the knowl-edge of this century and move forward into the next millennium ex-pediently. I remember when I was a State legislator, I had about 300 or 400 cancer patients who had been adjudged terminally ill come downto the Indiana State Legislature when we were debating an issuecalled Laetrile, and I know that 's a very controversial issue. But many of those people had been helped because they had used alter-native therapies and many had used Laetrile with some success.And the thing that frustrated me the most was the whole deter-mination of those who opposed Laetrile as well as any alternativetherapy. And the way they just ignored these people who were ter-minally ill, and it seemed to me at the time and it seems to metoday that if somebody is adjudged terminally ill, they ought to beable to do anything they wish to try to save their life. After all,hope is one of the major ingredients in keeping people going. Andwhen you take away that hope and just say go home and die, that 's just what they are going to do. Since a substantial portion of our population receives their healthcare through these agencies, it 's important to look at the level of integration of complementary and alternative medicine inthese programs. We 've heard the cry here in this chamber of ''Show me the science '' in hearings of this committee as the mantra of why alternative medicine should not be used. Caution is important.Good scientific data is important, and thousand of years of safe andeffective use of alternatives are also important. We will hear today from two esteemed physician researchers. Both Dr. Ornish and Dr. Berman have conducted clinical trials inalternative medicine. Each hold teaching positions at highly re-spected U.S. medical schools. Each has published in peer-reviewedjournals. Each has extensive experience and expertise in theirfields, and we 'll hear that there is good scientific research in alter- native medicine and an ever-increasing amount of that reported inpeer-reviewed medical journals. We'll also hear from the Department of Health and Human Serv- ices, the Federal Government 's principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans. The Department of Health and HumanServices is responsible for providing essential human services, es- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May who are least able to help themselves. Among these services is the Medicare program, the Nation 's largest health insurer. Many of these services are provided at the local level byState or county agencies or through the private sector grantees. For many Americans, especially those on Medicare and Medicaid, the denial of coverage is a restriction of access and in some cases,ultimately is a death sentence. The Department of Veterans Affairsprovides benefits and services to the country 's veterans. This is a population of over 25 million. They also provide care for approxi-mately 44 million family members. Given the increased demand bypatients to have access to alternative therapies, in April 1998, theVeterans Administration initiated a survey to determine the levelof alternative medicine availability and to assess what, if any, al-ternative therapies should be offered with the Department. Thatreport was due out in December 1998 and it has still not been re-leased and we 're going to find out why. The Department of Defense provides health care to its active- duty service members and active-duty dependants, retirees andtheir dependants, and survivors of deceased members and formerspouses. There 's an increasing number of healthcare providers within the Defense Department that have specialized training incomplementary and alternative therapies. Today, we have one of the foremost actresses, Jane Seymour, with us and she will present testimony regarding her experiencesin integrating natural healing approaches into her life. Ms. Sey-mour has had numerous experiences with alternative medicinesthat have helped her family. She will talk about her father 's cancer experience and her experiences of integrating herbs, homeopathy,and other complementary methods with conventional medicines. Dr. Brian Berman is the Director of the NIH-funded Complemen- tary Medicine Program at the University of Maryland in Baltimore.Dr. Berman has been a long-time advisor to the Federal Govern-ment on alternative medicine and he has conducted clinical re-search in acupuncture, mind-body and relaxation techniques, andcoordinates the complementary medicine field group of theCochrane Collaboration. We are in a time of change in this country. Healthcare is impor- tant to all of us. How can we, as a Government, provide qualityand effective care and not increase costs to the point of cripplingour system? Complementary and alternative medicine may be alarge part of the answer. As I have said before, we 've heard the mantra ''Show me the science '' and we are moving to do that today. We will show that there is already scientific data to validate theeffectiveness of several complementary and alternative therapies.We have moved to a point of looking at broader availability to ourarmed-services families and their veterans, and to those who relyon the Federal Government for part or all of their health care. Itis time that we assume and assure that scientifically validatedhealthcare moves out of the ivory towers of research communityand into the lives of the American people. We look forward to hearing from today 's witnesses. There has been a great desire by many patients, healthcare providers, asso-ciations, and researchers to speak to the committee on this topic.And we 're not able to bring them all in today, but we will hold the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May March 10 to allow for written submissions to be included in the record. And I want to thank all of our guests forbeing here today. I really appreciate it. I know it takes a lot of timeout of your busy schedule and we really, really appreciate that. I'll now turn to Mr. Waxman, our ranking minority member, who just arrived for an opening statement. [The prepared statement of Hon. Dan Burton follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. There is no denying the growing popularity of alternative medi- cines. They constitute a rising proportion of our healthcare expend-itures. The number and diversity of alternative products and serv-ices in the healthcare marketplace are increasing dramatically. Today 's hearing is focused on the right questions about alter- native medicines. It is important that we seek information abouttherapies that can help improve our well being and to encourageaccess to safe and effective treatments. At the same time, we mustpromote thorough testing and review of therapies to prevent unnec-essary harm and expense to consumers. I believe that a quote from a recent editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association provides the appropriate frame-work for today 's discussion. The Journal of the American Medical Association recently wrote ''there is no alternative medicine. There is only scientifically proven evidence-based medicine supported bysolid data or unproven medicine for which scientific evidence islacking. '' This is the test to which we must hold alternative medi- cine. Medicine of any kind must undergo the crucible of scientificinvestigation from clinical trials to publications in reputable peer-reviewed journals before it can gain a place in routine practice. Wemust place our trust in credible evidence and not mere speculation,or tradition, or popularity when we decide how best to care for thesick. The Federal Government and others have invested millions into research on alternative medicines. Some research has had prom-ising results. For example, the Journal of the American MedicalAssociation recently reported on a preliminary study indicatingthat yoga stretching can relieve some symptoms of carpal tunnelsyndrome. On the other hand, other therapies have proven ineffective or dangerous. For example in 1997, the deaths of three cancer pa-tients were linked to a Manassas physician who had been treatingthem by injecting them with concentrated aloe vera, a treatmentthat is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Pa-tients reportedly had learned about this physician 's treatment through the internet, word of mouth, or an aloe vera supplier. In highlighting ongoing research, examples of scientifically vali- dated forms of alternative medicine and positive personal experi-ences with alternative treatments, today 's witnesses will help sift through the positive and the negative aspects of this area of medi-cine. I join my colleagues in welcoming the witnesses here today and I just want to comment on the fact that we have a change of thelist of witnesses and their order which we were never advised ofuntil the very last minute. Not only were we not advised, but theGovernment witnesses \u2014and it would have been helpful for them to know when they were to appear \u2014were suddenly put on a third panel. And, I think for the record, I want to point out that weought to be courteous to all of the witnesses try to accommodatethem and also discuss with our colleagues, if we are going to havecollegial hearings, how we 're trying to treat the witnesses so we can get the opportunity to hear from them and not have them mis-treated by having the schedules changed on them. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May much, Mr. Chairman. I do appreciate the hear- ing. I think the hearing is a worthwhile one and I will try to behere as much as possible, but I certainly will review the record forthose witnesses where I am not present in the room because of con-flict of schedule. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Let me just say that wherever possible, we always have our agency and administration officials testify first. We do have sometime constraints which are a little unusual today. So, for that rea-son we 've changed our panel structure around a little bit. So if that inconvenienced you, we apologize for that. Mr. Hutchinson, do you have anything you would like to say?Mr. H UTCHINSON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm just delighted to participate in this hearing. I thank you for conducting this and I look forward to the testimony. And so in theinterest of hearing the testimony, I yield back the balance of mytime. Mr. B URTON . Are you saying the chairman talked too long? Is that what you 're saying? [Laughter.] Mr. H UTCHINSON . I would never say that, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kucinich.Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Wax- man, fellow committee members, and members of the panel. I ap-preciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing on com-plementary and alternative medicine. I applaud the chairman 's willingness to address this issue and I thank him for providing uswith this forum. As a witness to the theories and practice of alternative medicine, I support the committee 's efforts concerning this issue. With this in mind I look forward to exploring opportunities that will advancemedical care and expand the treatment options afforded to today 's doctors. I think that all of us in Congress are fully aware that our healthcare system is on the verge of radical change. The directionthat we are going remains to be seen, but with rising costs, withmore and more Americans not having access to adequatehealthcare, and with more and more Americans questioning wheth-er they have any availability to healthcare, I think there is becom-ing a greater and greater interest in alternative methods. This, in no way, is an attempt to denigrate allopathic practice be- cause I think that, at a minimum, many allopathic practitionerswould agree that alternative healthcare methods and therapies area proper adjunctive theory. I have great respect for allopathic prac-tice, but at the same time, I think that you will find that allopathicpractitioners who are candid will admit that there are limitationsto their own practice. I think that we are fully aware that the United States enjoys some of the most advanced health care in the world, but yet we areunable to provide relief for a number of common ailments. The cur-rent standards of practice occasionally fail to recognize that medi-cine is an ancient art that encompasses all methods of healing.Somewhere along the road to advance medicine we sometimes for-get that there are methods of treating those who need help. It 's time to help widen the vision of modern medical doctrine and ex- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May have to let go of the fear that alter- native medical practices will replace and endanger standards andinstead embrace the idea that any method that is proven a safeform of treatment ought to be available to the people. American citizens have a right to health care and as Members of Congress, we have a duty to ensure that they have every avail-able proven treatment option. Complementary and alternativemedical care encompasses numerous forms of studies and testedprocedures and practices and it is gaining support from main-stream medicine. Unfortunately, there is some unwillingness tosupport its practice and research. We must ensure nonprejudicialdisbursement of research funds to all disciplines of medicine, in-cluding alternative medicine. We must utilize this research notonly to educate practitioners and the public, but to provide themwith access to proven methods of alternative medicine. I hope these hearings will broaden our understanding of alter- native medicine; will expose and end any bias that may exist with-in our current system of medical doctrine. All citizens deserve ac-cess to safe and proven methods of medical care and I thank thechairman and the panel for expanding our understanding of medi-cine that some would deem, unfortunately, the alternative. Finally, Mr. Chairman, these hearings present a wonderful op- portunity. We have to think creatively about healthcare; to thinkdynamically; to draw new worlds toward us using a higher con-sciousness of the potential we have within us to make this a betterworld. I think that we need to urge Government officials to keepan open mind on alternative therapies. Anyone who is watching orlistening knows that once an individual has experienced a profoundshift in his or her health as the result of a new approach towardhealth care, it is important that the story of the miracle of an indi-vidual 's transformation be available to study, certainly, and also to share. So, I welcome Ms. Seymour and the other witnesses and I thank you for participating in these hearings. Thank you.[The prepared statements of Hon. Joe Scarborough and Hon. Ber- nard Sanders follow:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you, Mr. Kucinich. Well, we now finally are at the stage where we hear from our witnesses and the first witness, Ms. Seymour, would you come for- ward and sit in this chair right here in the middle, and if youwould like to have anybody with you, that 's fine. First of all, before you start your statement, let me just say how much we appreciate you being here. I especially appreciate youbeing here because I am one of your biggest fans. I watched youin East of Eden and I thought you did extremely well in that, andI saw you in ''Somewhere in Time, '' which is a very romantic movie. I saw your picture on the wall in that movie theatre and justswooned. So I just want you to know you have a big fan here inthe chairman and \u2014\u2014 Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Although we usually limit testimony to 5 minutes, you can have all the time you want. Ms. Seymour. STATEMENT OF JANE SEYMOUR, ACTRESS Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you very much, Chairman Burton, and thank you all for giving me this opportunity. This is, obviously,very unusual for me and something I am very excited to be a partof. My first experience with alternative medicine involved my father, Mr. John Frankenberg, a fellow of the Royal College of Obstetri-cians and Gynecologists in England. He specialized in infertilityand prided himself in being a good doctor, with extraordinary re-sults in his field, greatly due to the time he would spend listeningto his patients. When he himself was diagnosed with lung and bonecancer and treated with radiation, his oncologist told him that thatwas it. He had no more options. Distressed and desperate to find an answer, I found the Virginia Livingston Clinic in San Diego, a complementary medicine programwhich was heavily criticized by mainstream medicine. I offered thisoption to my father not believing that he would accept. However,after reading their brochure he did. On his arrival in California, he was frail, gray, and lifeless. Not the man I had always known, but rather a man who appearednearly dead, both physically as well as spiritually. After only 1week there undergoing complementary medicine therapies andantibiotics, he regained his strength and his spirit. He decided tovisit Sea World. He walked out of this wheelchair to look moreclosely at the exhibit. He was healthy looking and happy and wewere all, including his oncologist, dumbfounded. Many months later, he died of complications including heart problems, but he had a much longer life than predicted and, with-out question, a higher quality of life. He visited the opera 2 daysbefore his death. He was happy and comfortable until the end. Be-fore he died, I spoke with him asking if he had any regrets in hislife. And he said that his strongest regret was his not knowingmore about alternative medicine as he felt he could have been abetter doctor with that knowledge to complement his own. Since then, my sister Anne, who is with me today, has trained as a homeopath in England. I have seen her help many people. One VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May with fibroid tumors declared unable to conceive and told she needed surgery. Anne treated her homeopathically, andshe has just delivered a healthy child and the doctors found nofibroids present in her body. When alternative medicine finally ar-rives, how many surgeries like this will be prevented? My nephew with chronic Eczema has found relief at last with ho- meopathy instead of steroids. My sister, Sally, had a brain aneu-rysm and after surgery was given Arnica for the swelling with thepermission of her brain surgeon who admitted he didn 't really un- derstand what Arnica was. He was then astounded, as were all thenurses, who determined her swelling to be one-tenth that of theother patients who had received the identical surgery that day. In my own life, I 've used high-quality herbs, vitamins, and home- opathy. During my 16-hour a day, 5 day-a-week job on Dr. Quinn,I rarely got sick. Indeed, even pregnant with twins at 45, I wasable to support my immune system with this regime and not missa single day of work. I have recommended remedies to friends for headaches and flu symptoms with amazing success, even to the non-believers. Mychildren, both teens and babies, routinely use alternative medicinefirst. More often than not, it has solved their problems. My pedia-trician suggested homeopathy to avoid the excessive use of anti-biotics. One of my twins did so well with this that he was anti-biotic-free for over 6 months when all around him were sufferingfrom the flu. Recently, both twins with ear infections received antibiotics due to the severity of the case, but also took a series of other therapieslike herbal medicine to support their immune systems. They sailedthrough this as if they were never sick and needed far less anti-biotics rounds. It was amazing. Another friend with chronic migraines would vomit uncontrol- lably and lie in a fetal position crying for help. Medicine prescribedfor her did little. Only Codeine gave her some pain relief and sleep.The following day, she consulted a naturopathic medicine practi-tioner who after the session gave her a single remedy. She felt bet-ter within a half an hour and has remained pain and headache freeever since. About 9 years ago, I almost died of anaphalatic shock from an injection of Cephliosporin prescribed for bronchitis. Needless to saysince that close call, I 've been more inclined to ask questions and seek options in my medical health. Do we all need a severe wake-up call? I have managed to avoid antibiotics on many occasions bycatching early warning symptoms of viral infections using provenherbs such as echinacea, vitamins, and homeopathy. Two years ago, I was very ill with Leptospirosis, a bacterial in- fection contracted while filming in a swamp. I was eternally grate-ful to have Tetracycline, which absolutely saved my life. I am alsopositive that by my abstaining in the past from antibiotics when-ever possible and using complementary medicines, the antibioticworked more effectively in that crisis. The world of alternative medicine has become a major spark in my life and I am here to suggest the integration of western and al-ternative medicine within our medical establishments. It would bean injustice to deny America the information about and access to VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May particularly as it has now been proven through laboratory and clinical research and has shown to be costeffective with 100 to 500 years of reproducible clinical results. I am not standing here as a scientist, but as a concerned member of the public who has had the privilege to try these options whichare supported by scientific evidence. A recent article in JAMA estimated that there were 110,000 deaths annually from the use of medical drugs. It is the fourthcause of death in America. That is not to say that miracles havenot been achieved with the use of prescription drugs, and I am nothere to vilify western medicine. I am looking for inclusion, not ex-clusion. I propose every hospital in America include a complemen-tary medicine department consisting of two or three licensed practi-tioners who direct the complement to unassisted treatments suchas chemotherapy side effects and chronic, but not life-threatening,diseases. I propose the NIH stop withholding its billions of dollarsin research funds from the implementation of natural medicinesand protocols. When I get sick, my children, or my friends, I want to know that ''all'' has been done to protect their health. Everything! I don 't want to feel that I have to choose one medical system over the other.Each of us can benefit from a portfolio of medical choices and Iwant all the medical options available to me, to my family, and toyou. There must be room for all remedies that bring health to thepatient. Isn 't this hearing about healing? Alternative no longer needs to mean one or the other. There should be no alternativeother than the best health care known to man. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Ms. Seymour follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you very much, Ms. Seymour. That was a very, very enlightening statement. We are going to ask you somequestions now. Ms. S EYMOUR . OK. Mr. B URTON . You didn 't think you were going to get off scott free, did you? [Laughter.] I'd like to know a little bit more about your father 's situation. Do you know what kind of therapy they provided for him when he be-came deathly ill with cancer and they gave up hope? Ms. S EYMOUR . I have the data here somewhere that I can show you. He had a number of therapies, but the main ones were intra-venous vitamin C, which many people have poo-pooed, which I nowbelieve is done all over the country. And a special vaccine madethat was also at that time not allowed. In fact, he was very fortu-nate to get it. I believe the vaccine is now being used elsewhere inthe country routinely for cancer. He also had an enormous amountof emotional counselling, which I think was a very large factor, too. In his case, of course, the cancer was not caught early enough for him to go into remission. However, I think the point I am tryingto make here is that he was given the quality of life, a comfort, anda sense of living until the end which I think that every one whogoes through cancer should be entitled to, and especially if that ex-ists. And I think one of the reasons I am here today is because he was an eminent surgeon who did not necessarily believe or know any-thing about alternative medicine before. The fact that his only re-gret in life was that he didn 't get to know more about these options until just before he died is really one of the reasons I am heretoday. I meet an enormous number of medical practitioners whoreally believe that there are holes in what they are doing and thatthere really is a great need for alternative medicine as a com-plement to what they are doing, particularly as you mentioned, incancer. I have three friends who just went through breast cancer. All three of whom were told at one point by their oncologist that theirwhite blood cells were at a level that they, basically, were going todie. There was nothing more that could be done for them. And theyall said, ''well, what do you mean? What do we do now? '' And their oncologists said, ''well, there is nothing we can do now. We are fin- ished. This is it. We 've done our best. That 's all we can do. '' And my friends said ''well, are we supposed to walk out of door and die?'' And their oncologists said, ''well, we don 't like to put it that way, but there is nothing more that we actually can do. '' In all three cases, they found alternative medicine and, in fact in all three cases, it was Chinese herbal medicine that broughtback their immune system. All three of them are incrediblyhealthy. All in remission and all of them would swear by alter-native medicine, and that is another reason I am here. Mr. B URTON . Those are very impressive stories and it is not un- like the situation that my wife went through 5 years ago. Theygave her less than a 50-percent chance to live 5 years and she justcelebrated her 5th year and she is very healthy. So, I 'd like to make just one more comment along the lines of your father. He was a doctor and he was not enthralled with alter- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 until he became ill. For those who are from HHS and FDA, I hope you listen to this story. We had a Governor in Indiana who was deaf on alternative therapies and he supported the AMA 's position right down the line. And I fought with him when I was a legislator and he was Gov-ernor over some of these alternative therapies. His wife became illwith cancer and he went and used every alternative therapy hecould possibly use to save her life and I do not fault him for that.The only thing that bothered me was that that is the way it oughtto be for everybody. And he later became the head of HHS, inciden-tally. You mentioned in your testimony that you use alternative treat- ments in your children. How do you decide what is safe for yourchildren? Ms. S EYMOUR . My pediatrician is actually the person who started me out on this. She is a regular M.D. She does not practice anyalternative medicine. Her name is Dr. Lisa Stern, a prominent pe-diatrician in Los Angeles. She said to me that the use of antibioticsfor small children was not safe to do on a regular basis. That theywere trying to find other options and she suggested that I consulta homeopath. I consulted Dr. Asa Hershoff in Los Angeles with mytwins and we 've been using homeopathic and herbal remedies for them really pretty much since they were born. We use, obviously,things like chamomile for teething; Arnica for bumps and bruises;pulsatile for flu. They really are incredibly healthy considering bothof them were on heart monitors. Both of them were born early; 6weeks early and being twins, you know, they are not as resistantusually as other children to infections that are around them be-cause they had low birth weights. I generally will go to the pediatrician first and then I will take them to the homeopath and we 'd look at what the options are and, invariably, we 'd try homeopathy for at least a couple of days. Usu- ally it works and, therefore, we don 't end up having to use the anti- biotics. Mr. B URTON . Let me just ask one more question here. What would you say right now to mothers all across America about theuse of antibiotics? You just talked about that. I presume you wouldjust tell them to be very careful; not to use them unless it is abso-lutely necessary. I mean, how do you judge that and what wouldyou say to them? Ms. S EYMOUR . I think you go to your regular medical practitioner and I personally believe you also have a homeopath or someonelike that, a naturopathic doctor that you can consult. As a moth-er\u2014for me, I would check their ears and make sure there is no major ear infections or problems that way. And most pediatricianswill now agree and say that antibiotics should be used very spar-ingly in small children and they are very happy to have alternativemeans to try first. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Mr. Waxman. Mr. W AXMAN . Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Ms. Seymour. We are delighted to have you here and I appreciate yourtestimony. I think the important point that I get from what you had to say is that we don 't want one medicine here and another medicine VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May want the best healthcare possible for all of our people. And that means that everybody has to be open-minded enough toreevaluate information, and if new information comes out, weought to accept it. I gather your father had a feeling that as a med-ical person, he wasn 't open to some of these alternatives because he had been trained in a particular way and didn 't think about some of these other things that were being suggested. Is that a correct statement?Ms. S EYMOUR . Yes, I think the temperature has changed in America today. I think people are aware now that they can takehealth into their own hands and that preventive medicine is prob-ably a very important part of their lives. I think people are veryaware of how diet, nutrition, health, exercise, and all kinds of pro-tocols can really help them. My father discovered rather late in life that this is an area he wished he had known more about. Mr. W AXMAN . Well, I 'm not a scientist, but as a lay person and a consumer, I want to be able to have more of a say over what myfamily has in terms of healthcare and what decisions they wouldmake and I would make about whatever medicine that I may ormay not decide to pursue. But I also want the doctors to be opento other \u2014we call them alternatives \u2014but other indications of good health care. To me, one of the shocking things is that how little in medical schools they teach doctors about nutrition. Even though now weare learning so much more about the value of nutrition. Dr. Ornishwill be testifying and I know his long record in this area. It's important that we not look at medicine as one sort or another science \u2014good science to me ought to be open to alternatives and then those alternatives ought to be tested and accepted wisdomought to be retested as well so that we try to get the best that wecan for all of our people. Have you had any obstacles or members of your family encoun- tered any difficulties in trying to get access to these different rem-edies or different alternative practitioners? Ms. S EYMOUR . I have had no difficulty whatsoever. There are \u2014 you know, we were talking about studies. There are 3,000 blindand double studies, you know, done worldwide on the effects ofherbal medicine and these studies comes from countries like Ger-many, Japan, France, and England. So there are studies that canbe evaluated and I think it is rather remarkable that we accepttheir studies on making fair Mercedes or a German car and thatis acceptable to us, but we disregard what the Germans have to sayabout homeopathy and they are really, probably, the foremost inthe world in this area. I, obviously, have had no problem in finding help. No, and none of my friends. I would like to see the general public be able to havethis. My sister just brought with me a very interesting report fromEngland \u2014from a part of England which is close to a house that I own where the National Health did a study to see the cost effec-tiveness and how it would affect the general public in terms ofhealth. And they took half of that area of the National Health.They gave them regular medicine and the other half they used ho-meopathy and natural medicine and the results were astounding. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May 's response were as that 90 percent of them were very happy with the alternative medicine. Far less of them came backfor repeated visits to the doctor afterwards and the cost was somuch less to the National Health. So in England, they are takingthis very seriously. Mr. W AXMAN . And we should take it seriously here. There is no question that if we can prevent disease, we are far better off. AndI'm encouraged by the amount of attention I see in the press about encouraging people to exercise; watch their diet; to take care ofthemselves; and to understand the value of nutrition. This is, itseems to me, the direction that we ought to go as we learn moreinformation. I am going to ask you one other question. Do you have any sug- gestions on how the Government can help individuals obtain accessto alternative treatments that are safe and effective? Ms. S EYMOUR . I think that it would be very useful to have a panel of maybe 200 to 300 practitioners that is decided within al-ternative medicine \u2014as you know, there is 40 or 50 different forms of it\u2014that they should decide who this panel is. And they should be the people who should monitor amongst themselves as to whois actually doing the right alternative medicine and who isn 't. And I would like to see in the hospitals when you go to an oncologist,when you go to a hospital for cancer and you are offered chemo-therapy, that someone talks to you about how you can support yourimmune system while you are going through this. It is very cost effective. In fact, I think you will find less people becoming sick if we educate them in what they can do with alter-native therapies as a complement to, of course, the brilliant rem-edies that we do have in allopathic medicine. Mr. W AXMAN . I agree with you and \u2014\u2014 Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. I 'm glad you do. [Laughter.] Mr. W AXMAN . I was pleased that you mentioned the point about spirituality because I think that is very important in how peopleaddress their ailments because we don 't know why, but we do know that those who have an optimistic view of the world often are ableto heal themselves. Ms. S EYMOUR . It is called holistic medicine because wellness is about the whole being. I personally have discovered that homeop-athy and Chinese herbs do work for me and for everyone aroundme with remarkable results. So I do hope that money will be spentto enable this to be shared with the rest of the population. Thank you.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Waxman. Mr. Gilman.Mr. G ILMAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for bringing on this important issue be- fore our committee. The hearing should help to stress the need foralternative and complementary treatments into the mainstream ofhealth care and provide patients with a variety of treatment op-tions. And I 'm pleased that Dean Ornish is here to tell us about how he 's attacked the problems with regard to heart situations. And I want to thank Ms. Seymour for coming with her examples of how homeopathic treatment has helped her. How did you findthe homeopathic physician that you needed? Were they referred by another pa- tient? Ms. S EYMOUR . No, they are listed. They are quite easy to find. In fact, there is a brilliant thing called the Alternative MedicineDigest which is a phenomenal book that will tell you where you canfind any practitioner and how all the different methods work. Buthomeopathy is quite easy to find all over the world. Mr. G ILMAN . One of the things I 've found, Mr. Chairman, is that there is so little education on pharmaceutical agendas at the med-ical schools and I 'm just wondering whether alternative medicine has reached the training in the medical schools. Would you know that Ms. Seymour?Ms. S EYMOUR . I do know that my homeopath teaches, I think \u2014 is it at UCLA? Yes, he teaches at UCLA and I just recently, 2nights ago, spoke to one of the top doctors at UCLA, Dr. Becker,who said that they were about to instigate a program there inves-tigating the use of alternative medicine as a complement to whatthey were doing. Mr. G ILMAN . And maybe Dr. Ornish, in his testimony, can tell us a little bit more about the kind of training that exists in our Nationon alternative medicines. Studies have found, Mr. Chairman, that more than 40 percent of all of our people try alternative and complementary medical treat-ments, seeking out the advice of physicians with regard to thesetreatments. Many who have suffered through the agonizing effectsof traditional cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy and radi-ation. We all know some of those examples are now turning moreand more to complementary and alternative treatments like herbaltherapy, meditation, and nutritional therapy. In a bill I introduced several years ago \u2014and I 'll keep introducing it until we get some place \u2014is a preventive medicine to make cer- tain we do more in prevention that can save us more dollars on thecure if we apply prevention appropriately. And I 'm pleased that more and more nutritional advice is finding its way into our med-ical system. In our Nation, it is some sort of a stigma when we talk about alternative medicine, and as a result, funding alternative studieshas been difficult for physicians and researchers. Significantachievements are being made, though, in the cures for cancer thatare occurring overseas and in Europe and Asia. I think it is longoverdue that our Nation works together with its foreign counter-parts, sharing information, sharing strategies and treatments, andto provide our Nation with easy access to those treatments. Some patients in our Nation have the ability to travel overseas to receive alternative treatments, and we continually hear abouthow they go to great lengths to try to find some proper remedy. Butall Americans should be afforded that opportunity to access allforms of treatments, both traditional and alternative. We shouldpool our resources to create affordable, beneficial alternatives, toestablish treatments in an alternative form, from which all of ourpatients can benefit. So, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for focusing attention on the studies that have shown that these alternative complementarytreatments create positive results. It is our hope that, with hear- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 this, these treatments will be integrated into our healthcare system. I thank our panelists, Ms. Seymour and Dr. Ornish, for coming before us. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Gilman. Mr. Kucinich. Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I want to again state for the record that I think that the Chair is performing a veryvaluable public service, as is Mrs. Seymour for her participation.This is a subject that we are only beginning to get into on a na-tional level, and Congress has a great ability here to coordinate alot of knowledge. Again, it needs to be said that Mr. Burton isdoing something here that is important for the country. I thinkthat he should be supported in his efforts. That is why I am here. I also think that there is something about alternative medicine which is uniquely symmetrical with democracy and democratic tra-dition. We in this country believe in individual responsibility. Al-ternative medicine certainly does that. Would you agree, Ms. Sey-mour? Ms. S EYMOUR . Absolutely. Mr. K UCINICH . What would be your view as to how those who you love and your family have had more control over their ownlives by being able to seek alternative therapies? Ms. S EYMOUR . Well, for example, it was pointed out to me the other day that mammograms, which are routinely done on women,are now shown to be causing cancer unnecessarily. There are otherways of discovering the breast health with thermography andultrasound used together, and then the mammogram used to bol-ster that, to make sure that the symptoms are discovered. There are other options in so many different areas. I think the whole feeling of wellness, the whole concept of holistic medicine isto want to be healthy and to want to be in a well state, rather thanconstantly patching one 's self up with bandaids that will take away symptoms. Somebody once described homeopathy to me as, if youdrove a car and the oil light went on to tell you that something waswrong with your oil, you could have that light removed or youcould actually go to the garage and find out what part of your car,what part of the oil system is not working. I think this is what weare talking about in alternative medicine, that if we become intune with our health, then we may not get to such severe cases sooften. Mr. K UCINICH . Would you say that is self-empowering? Ms. S EYMOUR . Yes, I think there 's a lot of things we can do for ourselves, and we can empower people to take care of their ownhealth. Rather than bandaiding it with things that take awaysymptoms, I think they can listen to their bodies and probably hearthe symptoms and be able to notify the doctors as to what is reallyhappening in their bodies. Mr. K UCINICH . I think, Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, one of the values of this hearing, and hearing from Ms. Seymour and otherwitnesses, is that we start to shift our view of how health is de-fined. One could almost ask at the beginning of this hearing, alter-native to what? Because as we broaden our knowledge of VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May things that appeared at one time to be on the fringe or alternative suddenly become part of the mainstream. Ms. S EYMOUR . I think also a huge issue today for all of us is the support of the immune system. We never really thought of the im-mune system until we had viruses and AIDS and hepatitis C,which I believe is to be the next huge problem we have here. Ithink we all have a responsibility to ourselves and to our familiesto keep ourselves in as good health as we can, so that we are able,our bodies are able to withstand these viruses. Mr. K UCINICH . Mr. Chairman \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . If the gentleman will yield to me just for one com- ment \u2014years ago, when I was in the Indiana General Assembly and we were working on the laetrile bill, I called Dr. Linus Pauling \u2014 and I am sure you have all heard of him. He won two Nobel Prizes.I think one was for cancer research or scientific research. I wastalking to him about laetrile, and he interrupted me in mid-sen-tence and said, ''Well, that does have some promising qualities to it,'' he said, ''but the thing that I am convinced is going to save a lot of lives and prevent heart attacks and cancer is megadoses ofvitamin C. '' More and more people today are agreeing with what Dr. Linus Pauling said, and this was about 20 years ago. I might add that he lived to be 92 years old and didn 't have can- cer or heart trouble. So thank you very much for yielding, Mr. Kucinich.Mr. K UCINICH . Just in conclusion, so that we can move on here, what comes from any study of holistic medicine is an under-standing that healthcare is a profoundly personal matter. In linewith what I indicated previously about a symmetry with demo-cratic tradition and personal responsibility, we learn, as we explorealternative practice, that there is something, a process that beginsinside of each of us. Mr. Waxman referred to the potential for spiritual considerations in that. Belief systems, faith, and hope are all part of that processthat, in effect, happens before we meet that outside world, whichoffers us a variety of choices. So I think that as we look at this,the many options which are available to us begin, first, with ourown decision to be open-minded in approaching the possibilities ofbetter healthcare, which begin with ourselves. Ms. S EYMOUR . Yes, we don 't want to be statistics. We want to be considered as human beings, as people. You are very right; if youbelieve that you are going to be well and that you can be healthy,an enormous amount can be done. The mind can override enormoussymptoms. Mr. K UCINICH . Thank you again. Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Kucinich. Mrs. Morella. Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, this is a very informative hearing. Ms. Seymour, it is a delight to have you here.You are a role model. So, therefore, what you say has a tremendouseffect on attitudes. I just guess I want to try to synopsize your feeling, and that is that attitude is altitude; as we approach something, attitude iscritically important; that balance is important and openness. Forinstance, I think the American public has reached the point where VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May skeptical. We just don 't know what to believe. One day we hear about St. John 's Wort or something that is going to take the place of the antidepressants. We hear about other possible medica-tions or herbs that could be used for arthritis. From one day to thenext week, we find that there are differences in approaches. So ourconfidence is kind of eroded. We just don 't know what to believe. I guess what you are saying is you have got to continue to use mammograms, using that just as an example, since you mentionedit; you have got to continue to have co-rectal examinations, but atthe same time you should be open to the totality or the homeop-athy. Is this correct? Ms. S EYMOUR . To some degree. There are other options to mam- mograms. I think the point I am saying is, rather than the routinemammograms that we blithely all take without considering the costto ourselves healthwise in terms of the radiation and the fact thatit could cause cancer, there are other ways of doing this which arefar more cost-effective, which are thermography. I tried it the otherday, and it is amazing how they can discover what is wrong withdifferent parts of your body and accurate they were. I had a blindtest done on me because I didn 't believe in it. Sure enough, we called up my internist and my dentist, and the findings were abso-lutely agreed up. So there are other ways of detecting disease likethat, without necessarily hurting the human being. So I guess it should be investigated anyway.Mrs. M ORELLA . It is an openness, that we look to the various fac- ets, the various aspects. I just don 't want people to think that they can't go off and get these examinations regularly, or that they should not be part of their routine. Ms. S EYMOUR . No, but I do think that it would be nice if we could spend some of those billions of dollars on looking atthermography. There are only 30 people practicing that in thiscountry right now, whereas there are thousands in Europe, wherethey are doing this very successfully. This would also be a wonder-ful option for people in Third World countries, where they couldreally detect what was wrong with patients very inexpensively,very quickly. A lot of people could be helped. Mrs. M ORELLA . I want to thank you. Also, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the articles that you have given us all, too, thatI think are very uplifting in terms of the number of opportunitiesthat are open with regard to alternative medicine. Thank you.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Would you yield to me just real quickly? Mrs. M ORELLA . Indeed, yes. Mr. B URTON . I don 't have the exact figure in front of me, but I think $20 million is being used for alternative therapies and alter-native therapy research by the departments of health in our coun-try, and $2.3 billion is being used for conventional medicine. Ithink one of the things that we need to do, and I hope we arestressing today, is giving more funds for the alternative therapy re-search and complementary research, instead of just going aheadwith the conventional approach that we are taking. We had a doctor named Dr. Barry Marshall. Dr. Barry Marshall came up with a theory that stomach ulcers were not caused bynerves; they were caused by a bacteria. Well, conventional wisdom VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May medical profession for years and years and years and years was that it was caused by nerves. They said that bacteria could notlive in the acidity of your stomach. Well, he did some research andfound that it could. He gave a speech \u2014I think it was in Belgium \u2014 about this and he was laughed off the stage, literally. He then wenthome and drank the bacteria, became deathly ill, and cured himselfwith a combination of bismuth and some antibiotics. But the point is, there are billions of people in this country that are suffering from stomach ailments that can be cured because ofhis research. But he was ignored, not unlike what Pasteur was, fora long time. He proved that the bacteria does live in the stomach,and this alternative therapy research that he did alone is going tosave thousands, maybe millions, of lives and millions of peoplefrom this kind of pain. That is why I think, and I hope, these hearings that we are going to continue to have will point out the fact to the National Institutesof Health, to FDA, and everybody else, that we need to have morefunds used for research into alternative therapies. Because if we dothat, we are going to find, like Ms. Seymour has said, that thereare alternatives out there that are not as dangerous that are goingto help humanity. I thank the gentlelady for yielding.Mrs. M ORELLA . Thank you. NIH is in my district, and I know that they are moving ahead with alternative medicine. I just wanted to point out there is no one panacea. So we need to look at the entirety, and not just one little facet of it. Ms. S EYMOUR . Yes, if I may quickly add \u2014I didn 't know if I had time in my 5-minute speech, but we see incredible results withacne, which a lot of people suffer from acne and adult acne. Home-opathy can cure this within 4 days \u2014it is amazing \u2014without the use of injections and steroids and antibiotics and birth control pills andAccutane, which, of course, is very bad for women. There are options also with migraines and things like these. These are huge issues for the American public that can be helpedvery inexpensively and very quickly without any adverse effects. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mrs. Morella. Ms. Norton, do you have any questions? Ms. N ORTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I think these hearings are very important, and I appreciate that you havecalled them. And I appreciate your last statement about research, because in a very real sense oppositional thinking about alternative medicineand traditional medicine is very unhealthy, is not good for yourhealth. Hearings like this I think are important for the way inwhich they \u2014for particularly the notion of what is necessary in order to have an informed public. Ms. Seymour, I think we are very fortunate that you have been willing to come forward. By your own high profile, you raise theprofile of this very important subject. Our country is abysmally behind on coming to grips with alter- native medicine. It is hard for me to criticize my country in thisregard when I realize what it has done in traditional medicine;that in a real sense it is like being ahead in soccer, and I thinkyou neglect the other sports. We are so ahead on what we have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May world in everything from AIDS to \u2014that we let this slide. We are only now coming to grips with it. I have read books that \u2014I must tell you, the only books that con- vince me about anything are books that have been written by peo-ple trained in medicine who have something to compare it with. I have a question about the way we go about this. I have to con- fess that, without scientific evidence, I have myself often been veryopen to alternative suggestions about what to do, and, anecdoctally,have found some of them to be effective. I am more inclined to in-sist upon the scientific medicine when it comes to traditional medi-cine than I am to alternative medicine. That is proper, becausewhat the public kind of reads in the newspaper, in the magazines,gets absorbed as what kind of alternative medicine should be done. That is why what the chairman said about research is no less im- portant for alternative medicine than it is for any other kind ofmedicine \u2014I want to just take issue with your notion, for example, about mammograms. Some of us who are women in this Congresshave had a hell of a time getting women to be sufficiently unafraidto get mammograms because of all this stuff about radiation; thatthe whole notion that anybody without research would say, ''Well, I think I am going to wait until thermo-something ''\u2014look, all the scientific evidence now tells us that there is not radiation danger,and that if there is, it pales beside the danger of not getting amammogram. It is very important that there be research into alternative meth- ods. I would support that. But, again, the public really is just leftout there now. Whatever comes through the microphones, includingwhat we say here today, becomes what you ought to go out and do.That is not the case with traditional medicine, because there hasbeen some regulation. I associate alternative medicine as well with preventative medi- cine. That is one of the reasons why I am a great supporter of it.I applaud what NIH is doing. I don 't think it is enough, and I think it came too late, but I think it is important to do. I don 't agree that more training is necessary in order for doctors to do this. I have a young doctor. Young doctors who keep up withgood medicine will prescribe alternative medicine. If you go to adoctor who does not know anything about alternative medicine, youought not go to that doctor, because if she is reading in the lit-erature, she ought to know what is effective and not effective. Idon't think people should listen to anybody except a doctor or a sci- entist about what is effective or not effective, although I applaudthe notion of doing what I do. As an intelligent consumer, if youall don 't know yet, and nobody tells me that this is harmful to me, well, I am going to do what I think is good for my health. Thatdoes not stand in the place of research. Now I have a question to ask you, because I found your testi- mony very balanced. For example, you report in your testimony 110deaths annually from the use of medical drugs. Well, you know, we can get to the point where somebody is going to report, becausethere are no controls, because there is no good information aboutdeaths from alternative medicine. We are already getting thosekinds of reports. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 for society for alternative medicine is the same question society had when it had to decide whether or not youought to have x rays for your teeth or whether you ought to listento these people that say that, if you do, something will happen; youwill float into the universe. You have to intelligently decide whether or not there has been sufficient investigation, and there is no way for the public to knownow. Thus, the public does what I do. Look, if you say a megadoseof A, B, C vitamin will help me feel better in some way, well, fine,let me do this because nobody told me it will kill me. So I am goingto use a megadose. It is not very good, Eleanor, but that is whatI do. Now in your testimony you also said something very important here. You said, ''I am not here to vilify western medicine; I am looking for inclusion, not exclusion. '' And that is where our country has failed \u2014exclusion of alternative medicine. I would like to ask you whether or not \u2014I noted that in your breast cancer example these three women who used alternativemedicine had found that the doctors had said to them, ''There is nothing more we can do for you. '' Now, of course, there are women all over America, and these stories are beginning to come out, forwhom something can be done, who believe that this kind of tradi-tional medicine or that kind of traditional medicine for breast can-cer isn 't what they should do. So they are more likely to go into some alternative which has not been scientifically shown. I am asking you whether or not you would feel more comfortable if there were far more \u2014if our country engaged in a regime of great- ly increased controlled studies, so that the public could make in-formed decisions, instead of anecdotal decisions, about what is bestfor their health. Ms. S EYMOUR . There are studies, conclusive studies in \u2014\u2014 Ms. N ORTON . I am not talking about where there are studies. I am talking about where there are not studies. Ms. S EYMOUR . We should make studies, yes, and I would like that. I think this is what we are asking for today. Let 's appropriate some of those funds and get onto it right away, and have thosetests done, maybe even blind testing, the way they did it in Eng-land. Ms. N ORTON . It must be blind testing. Ms. S EYMOUR . Do it in the hospitals, and allow the people to have it, rather than waiting another 20 years and then find outthat what they were doing for 500 years did work. I am certainly not saying that mammograms shouldn 't be done, and I am certainly not saying that in breast cancer you should nothave chemotherapy. What I am saying, and what I testified \u2014and I am sorry if I was misunderstood \u2014is that we are talking about in- clusion here. We are talking about doing chemo alongside Chineseherbal medicine, which will help the patient to survive not only thecancer, but the chemotherapy. We have seen countless stories ofpeople where this has worked. I guess while we are eventually, however this happens in govern- ment, appropriating those funds, so we can investigate these andfind out who the true practitioners are, what the real scientificdata, and everyone gets happy about it. Meanwhile, Americans are VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May things. You, indeed, yourself are trying these things. You, indeed, are sort of admitting that they do work for you. Ms. N ORTON . Absolutely do. Ms. S EYMOUR . Absolutely. Ms. N ORTON . I want to make sure that I am not having an effect in my mind rather than in my mind. Ms. S EYMOUR . Well, the other people are the doctors, and they will tell you, but, from what I have been told in my data, maybeone or two people, if that, died last year from homeopathy, fromside effects of homeopathy. It is almost impossible to die from aside effect from those forms of alternative medicine, whereas it isvery easy and has been scientifically proven that over 110,000 peo-ple died last year from adverse drug reactions. These are not peo-ple who took drugs without being told by the doctors. These werepeople who were specifically designated to take those drugs forthose specific things, and at the time it seemed to be appropriatefor them to take those things. Ms. N ORTON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Ms. Chenoweth. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. Seymour, I can 't tell you how very pleased I am that you are here today. John Kennedy, back in the 1960 's, who was not the President of my party, but I am deeply grateful to him for raising the aware-ness of how important exercise is in our life. And perhaps you willhelp supplement how important it is that we control our ownhealth and stay ahead of the power curve in terms of boosting ourimmune systems and staying healthy. You may very well be onewho will take us on into the next century in boosting the publicawareness that we need alternative forms of medicine. You, like I, we are both very busy women. We shake a lot of hands, and we see a lot of people. We fly on a lot of airplanes. Weare exposed to a lot of things. I find it interesting, Mrs. Seymour,that I am 61, and my 30-something-year-old staff have to follow meout to Idaho and back for a weekend and take 2 days to recover.[Laughter.] Now the only difference is that I believe in homeopathy and I take massive doses of vitamin C. The reason I did, after havingworked for physicians for 18 years and really appreciating all thatthey do for their patients and the love they have for their patients,and how much they give \u2014nevertheless, there was such an entire freeze-out of other alternative forms of medicine from the statusquo institutional form of medicine, that when someone suggestedto me, when I had a very severe case of Manieres disease, that Isee a naturopath, I thought they were crazy. Finally, when thephysician suggested surgery in the head for a shunt to relieve thesymptoms of the Manieres disease, I finally went to a naturopath,who took a hair analysis and put me on zinc. The symptoms dis-appeared. I went out of obligation to the naturopath because of the deep re- spect I had for the person who just begged me to do it. Now noteverybody can have a miracle cure like that, but it certainly mademe realize alternative forms of medicine are so important to usbeing able to stay healthy and not ever have to, hopefully, expend VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 of money as we reach the final years of our life, which I don 't expect will be for quite a while for me, but I intend to stay healthy. Thank you very, very much for your contribution. It is deeply ap- preciated. I want to share with you the fact that there was a recent deci- sion in the 10th circuit court of appeals involving two litigants,Dirk Pearson and Sandy Shaw, who challenged the FDA on thefirst amendment rights for people involved in homeopathy to beable to talk about the results of their alternative medicine. Thecourt agreed with them that it is a first amendment right. In fact,the court bifurcated the decision and said, we will deal first withthe constitutional issue of first amendment rights, and then we willcome down after with a decision on the Administrative ProceduresAct. That was significant in the way the court did that. The court,obviously, felt very compelled about first amendment rights in thisissue. I was thrilled to see the way the court dealt with it. If youhaven 't seen that case, I recommend it to you. I think that it is important, Mrs. Seymour, that the government, the Congress recognize the importance of alternative form of medi-cine. I think that we need to support it in research. But, lookingdown the pike, if we give government money for supporting re-search, I want to make sure that those first amendment rights areguarded, and that government does not exert undue control, to thepoint that, again, we lose control of our own ability to stay healthy. Thank you so much for what you are doing, and thank you very much for being here. Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Chenoweth. Ms. Norton has an in- troduction, I think, real briefly here. Ms. N ORTON . I thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me to in- troduce some youngsters who I am very glad have gotten to hearthis. I do want to say to Ms. Chenoweth that the reason that the young people who travel back are so much more tired than youmay be the same reason that you don 't look 61. [Laughter.] Good genes.Mrs. C HENOWETH . Very good genes. Ms. N ORTON . Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the youngsters from the Knolle Elementary School had an opportunity to sit in.They are part of a program that I run for D.C. youngsters, who,after all, live in the District, called D.C. Students in the Capital.I want to welcome them. I will take them out in the hall now tosay a few words to them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Ms. Norton, and welcome to you, stu- dents. It is nice that you are here learning more about your govern-ment. Mr. Davis.Mr. D AVIS. Thank you very much. I know it has been a long morning for you, Ms. Seymour, but thank you very much, because I think what you have to say is veryimportant. Sometimes somebody of your stature coming up hereand saying it just wakes everybody up to something we have beenhearing anecdotally for some time. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 an OB/GYN. She was a tenured professor of obstetrics and gynecology, but I think she would agree with everything thatyou have said today. I don 't think there is any reason we can 't, up here in Congress, direct some money for the complementary medicine departments orcourses in the medical schools, so at least doctors will have someexposure to this. Right now they don 't seem to get it. In fact, con- ventional medicine, there is almost a push on against some of this. Your coming up here and speaking about it, and opening up that a lot of us have anecdotal information, I think helps that a lot. The key here is that Washington and Congress, and even the medical establishment, doesn 't always know best. We are dealing in some very changing areas where we are learning new thingsevery day. We want to enable consumers to make their best choice.We best do that by the kind of things that you have outlinedhere\u2014giving them the full gamut of information, so they can make intelligent choices, and letting our doctors and medical community,NIH, and others do some exploration to see why some of thesethings seem to work; that it is not necessarily in somebody 's head if it is working medi-physically as well. So you have done a great job. I appreciate your being here, and I hope that we can followup legislatively to some of that. I knowit has been a long morning. I won 't use all my time. But thank you very much. Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Mr. Davis. Ms. Biggert. Ms. B IGGERT . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mrs. Seymour, I was in Bolivia over our break on another issue, but we had the opportunity to stop by a museum, which was a mu-seum of preventative medicine by the natives, Indians, of Bolivia.It was quite interesting to see the bottles of herbs and the way thatthey addressed \u2014by looking at animals and the organs, how they would determine whether somebody had that illness. I wondered if that really is a part of homeopathic medicine. Has there been any movement to categorize what is used in, well, Na-tive American or other countries, the types of medicines that theyuse that has been of help to us? Ms. S EYMOUR . Well, I think, obviously, the people to ask about homeopathy are here today. You should address them on thatissue. I always found it amusing, when I was playing Dr. Quinn, that digitalis is what the Native Americans suggested as one of theherbs that she used. Then, of course, the Native Americans hadherbs which, of course, are now used in synthesized form in ourregular medicines today. So, yes, very much, I think these are things that we should look into. I mean, we all now take echinacea, a large number of the pop-ulation. Not very long ago, everyone said ''echinacea what? '' What is this stuff? As he said, Linus Pauling and vitamin C, and I am sure Bolivia has a lot of things to offer us and I am sure there areexperts here who can answer you exactly on that. Ms. B IGGERT . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 have a vote on. So what I think we will do is we will have the committee break, go down and vote, and come back. Assoon as we return \u2014and I apologize to the second panel \u2014we will have the second panel come forward. Dr. Ornish, I understand you have limited time. You have time constraints. So we will have you testify first and see how we aregoing on time. Then, at around noon, we have food and refresh-ments back there for the panelists. So we will break around noon,and then we will come back and finish right after we have lunch. Ms. Seymour, you have been a lovely witness. We really appre- ciate your being here. If you can stay around later, fine. If not, wewill see you later on today. Ms. S EYMOUR . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you very much. We stand in recess to the fall of the gavel.[Recess.]Mr. B URTON . Because of Dean Ornish 's time constraints, I would like to go ahead and get started with his testimony. Then we willbreak shortly after that for about 20 -25 minutes, so everybody can get a bite to eat. Then we will come back and finish with the sec-ond panel. Would the second panel come forward.So, Dean Ornish, welcome. We really appreciate your being here. I have read a great deal about you. Since we want to save sometime and get you on your way in a timely fashion, we will go aheadand let you testify now. STATEMENT OF DEAN ORNISH, M.D., PRESIDENT AND DIREC- TOR, PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, ANDCLINICAL PROFESSOR OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CALI- FORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO, CA Dr. O RNISH . Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don 't know how much time you want, but I am available until 10 after 1, just soyou know. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, Ms. Clay, thank you very much for the opportunity to be here today. My name is DeanOrnish. I am a physician. I am founder, president, and director ofthe nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute and a clinicalprofessor of medicine at the University of California, San Fran-cisco, School of Medicine, where I am also one of the founders ofthe new Osher Center for Integrative Medicine there. The theme of all of my work is simple, and that is, if we don 't treat the underlying cause of a problem, any problem \u2014in this case, heart disease \u2014that more often than not, the same problem comes back again. We get a new set of problems or side effects that wehadn 't counted, or on a social and health policy level we are often faced with painful choices. Whenever I lecture, I often start by showing a cartoon of doctors mopping up the floor around a sink that is overflowing, and nobodyis turning off the faucet \u2014a little like ignoring the oil indicator light on the car that Ms. Seymour was talking about. During the past 22 years, my colleagues and I have conducted a series of clinical trials demonstrating for the first time that theprogression of even severe coronary heart disease often is actually VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May making comprehensive changes in diet and lifestyle. These include a low-fat vegetarian diet, moderate exercise, stop-ping smoking, a variety of stress management techniques, includ-ing stretching and breathing and meditation exercises, and a lot ofemphasis on psyho-social and emotional support. This was a radical idea when I began my first study 22 years ago. It has now become mainstream \u2014the idea that heart disease is often reversible. It has become generally accepted by most cardi-ologists. In my testimony and in my research I am going to focus on heart disease, but I think it is also a much bigger issue. It is an exampleof how powerful changes in diet and lifestyle can be. We oftenthink it has to be a new drug or a new laser or a new surgical tech-nique, or something really high-tech and expensive to be powerful.We often have a hard time believing that these simple choices thatwe make in our lives every day can make such a powerful dif-ference, but they do. In the research that my colleagues and I have done, we have used these very high-tech, state-of-the-art measures to prove thepower of these very ancient and low-tech, and low-cost interven-tions. Within a few weeks after making these changes, the patients in these studies showed a 91 percent reduction in the frequency ofchest pain. Most of them became essentially pain-free, includingthose who had been unable to work or even walk across the streetwithout getting severe chest pain. Within a month, we found thatthose patients not only felt better, but in most cases they were bet-ter in ways we could actually measure. We found that the bloodflow to the heart improved. We found that the ability of the heartto pump blood was better. After a year, we found that even se-verely blocked arteries began to become measurably less blocked,became improved, in 82 percent of the patients. These research findings were published in the most respected peer review medical journals, including the Journal of the AMA,the Lancet circulation, the American Journal of Cardiology, andothers. This research was funded in part by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of NIH. Although it is very difficult to get fund-ing to do this kind of work, and early on, when I began doing it,it was a bit of a catch -22, because it was thought impossible to re- verse heart disease. So it was hard to get funding from the govern-ment and from the conventional major foundations. Without thefunding, we couldn 't show it was feasible. And since they didn 't think it was feasible, they didn 't want to fund it. And then they said, well, where 's the evidence to show that we should fund it? It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. I might add, by the way, that in order to get the studies under- way, we said, let 's just raise the money as we go along and hope that we can do it. As we began to get more data showing it wasworking, initially financed by just individuals who thought this wasan interesting idea, over time we later got major foundation andmuch later NIH support. In our latest report, which was published in the December 16, 1998 issue of the Journal of the AMA, we found that these patients VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May to stay with it for 5 years, not just for 1, and, on average, they showed even more reversal of heart disease after 5 years thanthey did after 1 year. In contrast, the patients who were in the comparison or control group, who were making more moderate changes, got worse after1 year, and even worse after 5 years. So moderate changes don 't go far enough even to stop heart disease from getting worse. Butthe good news is that, if people are willing to make bigger changes,they can stop and in most cases even reverse it. We also found that the incidence of cardiac events, like heart at- tacks and strokes and operations, was 2 12times lower in the pa- tients who made these lifestyle changes than in the control group. There has been strong interest in the general public as well, as Ms. Seymour has alluded to. A 1-hour documentary of our workwas broadcast on NOVA, the PBS science series, and was featuredin Bill Moyers' series, ''Healing in the Mind.'' I think these research findings have particular significance for older Americans and the Medicare population. One of the mostmeaningful findings was that the older patients who made lifestylechanges in our research improved as much as the younger ones.When I began doing this work, I thought that the younger patientswith milder disease would be more likely to show reversal, but Iwas wrong. The major determinant of improvement wasn't how oldor how sick they were; it was how much they changed. In fact, theoldest patient, who is now 83, showed more reversal than anyone. This is, I think, a very hopeful message for people in the Medi- care population, because it says, since the risk of bypass surgeryand angioplasty increase with age, that the benefits of changinglifestyle occur at any age, I think that this has particular benefitfor older Americans and offers many of them new hope and newchoices that they didn't have before. I think these findings have particular significance also for women. This is by far the leading cause of death in women, espe-cially in the Medicare population. They have less access to conven-tional treatments like bypass surgery and angioplasty. I spoke forthe Surgeon General's Conference a couple of years ago on thisvery issue. When women do get operated on, they don't do as wellas men. They have higher rates of mortality and morbidity fol-lowing a bypass or an angioplasty. So that is the bad news. But the good news: Women seem to be able to reverse heart dis- ease easier than men can, whether through diet and lifestyle oreven through lipid-loren drug therapy. If you give a woman estro-gen to lower the risk of heart disease, you raise their risk of breastcancer. But if you change lifestyle to lower the risk of heart dis-ease, you lower the risk of breast cancer and osteoporosis. Hereagain, when you treat the cause, you don't have to make thesepainful choices that often occur when we literally or figurativelyjust bypass the problem without also treating the cause. The next research question, once we demonstrated that heart disease was reversible, and that became generally accepted, was:How practical is this? People said, well, sure, you can reverse heartdisease, but you live in California; they will do anything there; noone else can do this. So we began training hospitals around thecountry. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 know, there has been bipartisan interest in finding ways of controlling healthcare costs without compromising the quality ofcare. Many people are concerned that the managed care approachis simply shortening hospital stays and shifting to outpatient sur-gery and forcing doctors to see more and more patients in less andless time, while compromising the quality of care, because, hereagain, they are not treating the cause. It is frustrating for physi-cians, and it is frustrating for patients as well. Beginning 5 years ago, my colleagues and I established the Multi-Center Lifestyle Demonstration Project, a nonprofit institute.We wanted to find out: How practical is this? Can we train otherhealth professionals in other parts of the country to do this? Canthey motivate their patients to the same degree that we did? Canthis be not only a medically effective, but also a cost-effective alter-native to things like bypass surgery and angioplasty? In the past, lifestyle changes have been viewed as prevention, but we are showing they can also be an alternative treatment. Iwent to insurance companies and I said, ''Would you pay for these kinds of interventions? '' They said, ''No, we don 't pay for diet and lifestyle. '' ''Why not? '' ''We don 't pay for that because that is prevention. We don 't pay for prevention. '' ''What is wrong with prevention? '' ''Twenty to thirty percent of people change companies every year. It may take years to see the benefits. So why should we spend ourmoney today for some future benefit that may occur years later,when chances are some other company will get it? '' And I said, ''It is the right thing to do. '' That wasn 't persuasive enough. So I said, ''It is not just prevention. It can be an alter- native treatment. For every patient, every man or woman, whochooses to change lifestyle rather than, say, undergoing bypass sur-gery, you save $50,000 immediately \u2014real dollars today, not just theoretical dollars years later. '' They replied, ''That sounds great in theory. We don 't think peo- ple can do it. So it is too hard to change lifestyles. So if we payfor your program, most patients who can 't follow it, we will end up paying for their bypasses anyway. Now our costs have gone uprather than down. '' So the missing links really were the data on adherence. Then not only the immediate savings, but also the long-term savings canoccur because so many bypasses and angioplasties clog up afterjust a few months or a few years; 40 to 50 percent of angioplastiedarteries clog up again within just 4 to 6 months. There is potentially a lot of money to be saved. In 1994, over $15 billion in the United States was spent just on those two operations.So that even if only 20 or 30 percent of the people were willing tomake these changes, it is a savings of billions of dollars per year \u2014 real dollars today, because it is a direct alternative to these treat-ments. So we have trained a diverse selection of hospitals \u2014Alegeon Em- manuel Center in Omaha, and Mercy Medical Center in Omaha,Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, Mercy Hospital in Iowa,Broward General Hospital in Ft. Lauderdale \u2014a whole list of them VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 written testimony. Also, High Mark, which is west- ern Pennsylvania Blue Cross/Blue Shield is both providing the pro-gram as well as covering it. Over 40 other insurance companies arecovering this program as a defined program at the sites that wehave trained. We have been approved by the Technology Assessment Commit- tees of Blue Cross and of Blue Shield of California separately twoseparate times, and found to be reimbursable and noninvestiga-tional. What we found, which we published in the American Journal of Cardiology 3 months ago, was that 77 percent of men and womenwho were eligible for bypass surgery were able to avoid it by chang-ing lifestyle, by going on our program. Mutual of Omaha, which was the first insurance company to cover this program, calculated savings almost $30,000 per patientimmediately. These patients reported reductions in chest pain orangina comparable to what you can get with bypass surgery orangioplasty, but without the costs and the risks of going throughthat. Now what about Medicare? Over half a million Americans die an- nual from coronary heart disease, making it by far the leadingcause of death in both men and women. As I mentioned, $15.6 bil-lion was spent in 1994, more than for any other surgical procedure.Not everybody is interested in changing lifestyle, but a lot of peopleare, and billions could be saved if people changed. But, as you said in your opening remarks, Mr. Chairman, for many Americans the denial of coverage is the denial of access. Sur-gery is covered; angioplasty is covered, but lifestyle changes arenot. Because of the success of our research and demonstration projects, we asked HCFA, the Health Care Financing Administra-tion, to consider providing coverage for this program, or ones likeit, if they had the evidence to prove that they were. I really believethat this can help provide a new model for lowering Medicare costswithout compromising the quality of care or access to care. It is anew model that is more caring and more compassionate and morecost-effective and competent, because we are treating the cause; wedon't have to have these painful choices. This approach empowers the individual. It can immediately and substantially reduce healthcare costs by billions of dollars, whileimproving the quality of care, rather than limiting access to it. Itoffers the information and tools that allow individuals to be indi-vidually responsible, personally responsible, for their ownhealthcare choices and decisions, and it provides access to quality,compassionate, and competent, affordable healthcare to those whomost need it. Now, without going into the details \u2014and I am happy to elabo- rate in the question-and-answer period \u2014I first began meeting with officials from HCFA in June 1994, almost 5 years ago, and I havehad many, many meetings and conversations with them since then.Then, as now, the concern was that, if we start to pay for anythingother than surgical procedures, and so on, if we start to pay foranything that is, ''alternative '' medicine, then a Pandora 's box would be opened. In other words, anyone who had any kind of al- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May say, well, you are covering this program; why don 't you cover ours? Or, even in a more limited way, people who had one for treating heart disease would say that.I understand this concern. It is a valid one. In the first meeting almost 5 years ago with people from HCFA, I was accompanied by the medical director at that time with Mu-tual of Omaha. He said, We have the same concerns and here is how we dealt with it: We only pay for programs that have scientific data to support them, whether they are traditional ornontraditional approaches. And this right now is the only lifestyle intervention thathas scientific data from randomized control trials showing that it can reverse heartdisease. So we paid for it. And when other people develop those data or they haveprograms that are similar enough, we will pay for those, too. I appreciate very much the leadership of Honorable Nancy-Ann Min DeParle and her colleagues, Dr. Jeff Kans, Dr. Bob Berenson,Dr. John Whyte, and others at HCFA. After going back and forthwith them for years now, during which a variety of different op-tions have been considered, including a demonstration project, I amrespectfully requesting that HCFA now make a decision to coverthis program for selective patients. Another demonstration project would, in effect, duplicate largely what we have already done and what we have already publishedin peer review journals. It would cost millions of dollars. It wouldtake years before a coverage decision could be made, and I thinkthe time is right to do it now because Americans can benefit fromthis. Coverage can be limited to those people who are choosing this program as a direct alternative to a bypass or angioplasty, becausethese are the patients for whom the cost savings are the most dra-matic and the most immediate. It, also, can reduce the likelihoodof fraud and abuse because you have to get a letter from your doc-tor saying that this person is sick enough to need a bypass. Youhave present test data from angiography and other tests showingthat this person really is qualified to have a bypass or angioplasty.Because the program is difficult, people who aren 't interested in changing lifestyle to this degree aren 't going to do it, and they self- select, which is good. Because the real question is not, how manyAmericans are willing to change; the real question, if I were atHCFA, would be, how likely is it, if we pay for someone, that theyare likely to succeed? If they self-select for people who are likelyto succeed, that is OK. That is part of the reason why we found that almost 80 percent of people were able to avoid these oper-ations. Then my colleagues and I would be happy to work with an out- side group. I am meeting in 10 days with the heads of the Amer-ican College of Cardiology at their annual scientific meeting in NewOrleans to say, you could be a credentialing group to certify whohas the scientific evidence \u2014not just as anyone who has the evi- dence to support that their program works. That can meet HCFA 's understandable need for credentialing of programs, to make theprogram available to the people who most need it. In response to an earlier request from Bruce Vladeck, Honorable DeParle 's predecessor, Dr. Claude Lenfant, the Director of the Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute at NIH, evaluated this program, VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May be safe \u2014actually, had to go through a process saying it was safe for older Americans to walk and meditate and quitsmoking and eat vegetables, but we have been through that proc-ess. We also have strong bipartisan letters of support from some of the most conservative Republicans, some of the most liberal Demo-crats, and everyone in between. I think this committee is an exam-ple of how this is a basic need that affects all Americans. This isan area we can all come together, I think at a time when our coun-try really needs that kind of bipartisan support. We have support from some of the country 's most eminent med- ical authorities: Dr. Alexander Leaf, who was the chief of medicineat Harvard; Dr. Christine Cassel, who is the immediate past presi-dent of the American Board of Internal Medicine in the AmericanCollege of Physicians; Dr. Marion Nestle, the chairman of nutritionat NYU, and so on. We also appreciate very much a recent appropriation from Con- gress to the Department of Defense to make this program availableat the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I am very grateful to Dr.James Simbol, who is the president of the Uniformed Services Uni-versity, and Dr. John Mazzuchi, in the Office of the Secretary ofDefense, who are here this morning. Because if heart disease can be reversed, not only can it save money in the military, but the implications for prevention are evengreater. As we have talked about, we focused on heart disease asa model, but I think the same kind of lifestyle interventions canreduce the likelihood of diabetes, hypertension, obesity, breast can-cer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer. I am directing a study now, in collaboration with Dr. William Fair from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, who has beenthe chief of urology there, and Dr. Peter Carroll, the chairman ofurology at UCSF, to see whether the progression of prostate cancermight be stopped or reversed. It is the first randomized controltrial to look at that. Our preliminary data are very encouraging,and if it is true for prostate cancer, chances are it may be true forbreast cancer as well. A recent editorial by the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine last year said, ''There can 't be two kinds of medicine, con- ventional and alternative. '' This is very similar to what was said earlier about the JAMA editorial. There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not; medicine that works and medicine that may or not work. Once a treatment hasbeen tested rigorously, it no longer matters whether it was considered alternativeat the outset. If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective, it will be accepted. Now this program, our lifestyle program, has been tested rigor- ously. It has been found to be safe and effective. It works. So,therefore, I respectfully submit that it should be covered by Medi-care for selective heart patients as an alternative to a bypass orangioplasty. Everyone benefits. Patients have access to new choices that em- power the individual. Health professionals have new options toserve their patients. Medicare does something innovative to lowerhealthcare costs without compromising the quality of care, and VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May demonstrate bipartisan leadership in an area that is important to so many Americans. I appreciate very much the opportunity to be here today. I would be delighted to answer any questions you may have. [The prepared statement of Dr. Ornish follows:] VerDate Dr. Ornish. Now HCFA has been unresponsive to your request, is that cor- rect? Dr. O RNISH . No, sir, I wouldn 't put it quite like that. I think Honorable DeParle has been very responsive, and I have great ad-miration and appreciation for what she and her colleagues aredoing. But I think that to make this a covered benefit will require con- gressional statutory authority because it currently isn 't. They don 't cover, just like many insurance companies didn 't cover, lifestyle interventions. Mr. B URTON . I wasn 't aware of that. So, without congressional authority, they can 't expand the funding for this kind of a pro- gram? Dr. O RNISH . Well, these are things we don 't learn much about in medical school, so I am not sure. Mr. B URTON . I will have to check into that. I will tell my staff to check into that, but we will try to contact the people at HCFAand HHS to see if we can have a dialog about that. We may havesome people from those agencies here today; I think we do backthere. I will be happy to talk to them about that as well. Dr. O RNISH . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . I have a number of my colleagues and friends who have had bypass surgery and have had angioplasty, and it is de-pressing and surprising for me to hear you say that, within 4 to6 months after angioplasty, the arteries can once again close up. Dr. O RNISH . Yes, in 30 to 50 percent of the cases. Mr. B URTON . In 30 to 50 percent of the cases? Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Is that widely known? I was not aware of that. Dr. O RNISH . Well, there is a lot that isn 't widely known. This is widely known within the medical profession. But, you know, it goeseven further than that, sir. Mr. B URTON . If it is fairly wide known in the medical profession, why is that not communicated to patients and the public, becauseI don 't think it has been? Angioplasty, at least the people that I have talked to that have had it, is seen as a panacea. Obviously,they ask them to have dietary changes, and so forth, to try to keepit from coming back, and they take an aspirin and all that sort ofthing. But the fact is, I don 't think anybody I have ever talked to that has had angioplasty knows that there is a good chance it will reoc-cur within a short period of time. Dr. O RNISH . Well, that is the problem, getting the information out, and that is part of why I write books and give lectures andthings, and why I appreciate the chance to be here today. But if you actually look at all the scientific data, if we talk about we want evidence-based, randomized, double-blind \u2014or not double- blind, but placebo-controlled studies. There have been three majorrandomized trials of bypass surgery, and in every one of them theyfound that bypass surgery prolongs life or prevents heart attacksin only about 2 percent of people. Those are the most severe dis-eases. Mr. B URTON . Only in 2 percent of the people. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May Two point one percent, to be exact. These are people with left main coronary artery disease and poor left articular func-tion. No study has ever even been conducted that compares angioplasty with just drug therapy to see whether it prolongs lifeor prevents heart attacks. So for the vast majority of Americanswho get operated on for these two operations, for which billions ofdollars are spent every year, there is no evidence that it prolongstheir life or prevents heart attacks. What it does do is relieve theirchest pain or their angina. So it has value. But we found in all ofour studies a greater than 90 percent reduction in angina or chestpain within weeks when people make bigger changes in diet andlifestyle than most doctors recommend. Mr. B URTON . Within weeks, you say? Dr. O RNISH . Within weeks. Mr. B URTON . Usually, when people go in and they are diagnosed with arteries that are closed or almost completely closed, the doc-tors prescribe surgery or angioplasty within a very, very short pe-riod of time. Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . The danger is, somebody says, I have been diag- nosed with 90 percent closure in one artery and 100 percent in an-other, and the doctor says, if we don 't act pretty quickly, you are going to have a heart attack. The fear factor is very great. Dr. O RNISH . That is correct. Mr. B URTON . For them to talk to somebody like you, who says, if you change your diet and change your lifestyle, in 4 to 6 weeksthings will get better \u2014they worry about being around in 4 to 6 weeks. Dr. O RNISH . That is right. Mr. B URTON . So how does a person who goes in, they say you have got closed arteries; you run the risk of a heart attack \u2014how does he get that information, when his doctor says you have tohave surgery; you have to have angioplasty? Dr. O RNISH . Well, it is a very important question. Let me re- spond on two levels. The first is, how do you get the informationout? And the other is, what does the medical science show us? Interms of how to get the information out, I think you change reim-bursement, you change medical practice, and you change medicaleducation. I used to think that good science was sufficient, and Iwas naive. I think good science is important, but generally suffi-cient to motivate lasting changes in physician behavior. I think wehave to change reimbursement. And I want to make it clear, mostdoctors are motivated by service, but if you are trained to do thesethings and you get reimbursed to do these things, then that is whatpeople do. So if Medicare were to cover this, it would have implications that go far beyond this. It would change medical education as well asmedical practice. Now it turns out that the 90 percent lesions are not as dangerous as the 30 percent ones. That is the conventional thinking nowamong some of the leaders in the field, like Dr. Valentine Fusterat Harvard, and so on. It seems a little counterintuitive becauseyou think that, the more blocked it is, the greater the danger. The VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May it is, the more likely it is to cause chest pain. But it is actually the more mild lesions, the 30 to 40 percent, that aremore likely to cause heart attacks because they are more unstable. Now no one is going to bypass the 30 percent blockage, and yet, those are the ones that may be the most dangerous. But when aperson changes diet and lifestyle to the degree that we do, or evenwhen they go on cholesterol-lowering drug therapy, the endo-thelium, the lining of the artery, stabilizes, and the risk of a heartattack goes down dramatically. Most patients don 't know that the surgery is unlikely to prolong their life, unless they are unstable, which is a separate category,which most patients are not, or they are the 2.1 percent of patients.For most patients, the surgery is not going to prolong their life orprevent a heart attack. They don 't know that, if they were willing to change their lifestyle, they could accomplish the same reductionin angina. Mr. B URTON . Let me ask you two quick questions. Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . If a person who normally would have a very small chance of survival, like you said, it is not going to change their life-and-death situation if they have the heart surgery or theangioplasty. If they have the heart surgery or if they took the alter-native therapy, do you have any studies or any figures that showhow long their lives would be extended, or do you have any kindof an average? Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir. We found, in the study that came out in the Journal of the American Medical Association 2 months ago in De-cember 1998, there were 2 12times fewer cardiac events in people who changed their lifestyle compared to the control group thatmade more moderate changes. So people not only feel better, butin most cases they are better. We used quantitative arteriography to measure the blockages. We used cardiac PET scans, positron emission tomography, tomeasure blood flow to the heart. The state-of-the-art showed thesepatients got better and better over time. Now not everybody wants to change lifestyle. I don 't even tell my own patients to change. But I do believe in freedom of choice. Ithink it is a very American idea. For those people who don 't want to change, I find a good surgeon or a good interventional cardiolo-gist or I put them on drugs. But for that subset of patients whoare willing and who are motivated to change \u2014and that subset is a lot bigger when people really know what the facts are \u2014I think it would be nice to give them the freedom of choice, too, by coveringprograms like this. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Ms. Norton, do you have any questions?Ms. N ORTON . Yes, Mr. Chairman. This hearing is very well-struc- tured, Mr. Chairman, I think, because we are going to get to ques-tions of representatives of the Federal Government to establish re- sponsibility here. I am glad we heard of your own testimony before-hand, Dr. Ornish. I think it is very valuable testimony, preciselybecause you are a credentialed and experienced physician. Dr. O RNISH . Thank you. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 The balance that you bring to the table is very im- portant, particularly as we try to play catch-up, it seems to me, onmaking available these approaches. What you have spoken aboutis hard to call an alternative approach because it is also a preven-tive approach. Dr. O RNISH . Yes. Ms. N ORTON . It is what most fascinates me about homeopathic medicine. I appreciate the full information you have given us. Forexample, the chairman asked an important question: Well, how inthe world, if 30 to 50 percent close back up again, as it were, butyou indicate that they do bring some relief. Obviously, a physicianwants to bring some relief to the chest pains. So he wants to dowhatever he can; he wants to do it quickly. So he has somethingthat works and he hopes that the next thing will work. I want toask a question about that. I do believe what you say about, well, let those who will; most people won 't. Well, let 's do it for those who will. I do think there is a very strong case to be made, since I do believe \u2014and here you are talking about what we do have evidence about \u2014that these changes, if you are willing to make them \u2014can both prevent heart disease and help retard it once you have had a heart attack. This morning there was a report \u2014I heard it on the National Public Radio; it was a very informative report \u2014about autopsies that were done on young men. I think it was young men from theKorean War. Now they have done all of the studies. Dr. O RNISH . Yes, ma 'am. Ms. N ORTON . It was quite amazing. Essentially, it is not about old fogies like me. It is about how young people like my legislativeassistants are getting their arteries all clogged up, as I speak \u2014\u2014 Dr. O RNISH . Yes. Ms. N ORTON [continuing]. And won 't pay any attention to it until they get to be middle age, and then they have found that these peo-ple in their twenties are showing signs, significant signs, of heartdisease. By the time they got as old as 35, they just had it. Nobodyeven thinks about heart disease at those ages. Two questions: One is, if this information is available, so that physicians, who also don 't concentrate on young people, in part, be- cause they don 't go to the doctor, if physicians look to young people as a way of dealing with heart disease, a runaway problem in thissociety, won 't this, in turn, get us to the point that you want to get, which is the change in the lifestyle will become more automatic? I ask this question because young people became environmental- ists when it took old people, who had been so used to being waste-ful, to understand it. So they became teachers, as it were, for olderpeople. Is there a way, now that we know that heart disease it not sim- ply a disease of middle and old age, to get to where you want toget simply by changing our focus from the pool that has been thetarget to a younger pool, in which case some of the problems get prevented and the others, it seems to me, we are able to deal within a lifestyle you indicate. I would like to hear you discuss how thismight be done, if it could be done, if it would be effective. Second,how it might be done, given the fact that young people not only be- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May immortal, but have no reason to seek the help of physicians, for the most part? Dr. O RNISH . Well, Ms. Norton, I appreciate so much the question. You are absolutely right; studies have shown that American sol-diers killed in Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, even at the ageof 19, had significant plague in their coronary arteries. A studydone by Dr. Gerald Berenson in Louisiana found that children whodied in accidents, that half of them had severe plaque, and all ofthem had blockages in their aortas. So this is a problem that be-gins in childhood and progresses over a period of decades. So youare quite right; that is where we have to begin. Now the old joke is, if I change my lifestyle, if I eat this way, am I going to live longer or is it just going to seem longer? Youknow, that is what a lot of young people think, that lifestylechanges \u2014\u2014 Ms. N ORTON . Either will do. Dr. O RNISH . Pardon me? Ms. N ORTON . Either will do at this point. [Laughter.] Dr. O RNISH . Well, there is this myth that the good life is eating a high-fat diet and getting drunk and using cocaine and smokingand getting under a lot of stress, and that it is boring to have ahealthy lifestyle. Part of what I have learned is that telling ayoung person they are going to live to be 86 instead of 85 does notmotivate them. In fact, it hardly motivates people who are 85 \u2014 [laughter] \u2014because people want to feel better. The paradox I have found is that it is actually easier to make big changes than to make small ones. That is why I began chang-ing when I was 19, growing up in Texas, eating meat a lot, becauseI found I felt better. I had more energy. I could think more clearly. Now you know Viagra came out last year at the same time the Nobel Prize was awarded to the doctors who discovered a com-pound called nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels. One of thethings that happens when people change their diet is that theirsexual function often improves, particularly in older men, becauseit is not just your heart that gets more blood flow. People find thatthey think more clearly. They have more energy. Now, as a sci-entist, those are harder things to measure than arteries in coro-nary blood vessels getting better, but from the motivational stand-point, one of the most effective anti-smoking ads was not ''smoking causes cancer, '' but ''do you want to taste like you have been licking an ashtray when someone kisses you? '' It puts it into the here and now. That is what younger people really respond to, changes that af- fect their quality of life in the short run. We doctors like to talkabout risk factor reduction and prevention, but most young peoplefind that boring. I have found that we need to talk about changesin lifestyle that improve the quality of your life very quickly. Thatis what happens when you make changes. I think it is never tooearly to begin making these changes, and it is never too late tobegin making them. Ms. N ORTON . Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. Thank you, Doctor. Mrs. Chenoweth.Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. VerDate was fascinated as you gave your testimony because you almost gave it word for word with rarely looking at your notes.[Laughter.] Interesting observation.I wanted to ask you, it seems that the dog in the manger seems to be the insurance companies. You said it better than I did. Youwere more politically correct. You said, once reimbursements get inline, then the rest of the policy will follow. I couldn 't agree with you more. On page 4 of your testimony, you mention that 77 percent of the patients who were candidates for bypass surgery or angioplasty re-sponded very positively to your recommendations or those types ofrecommendations, and that Mutual of Omaha said that it saved$30,000 per patient. Dr. O RNISH . Immediately. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Immediately. These guys look at the bottom line\u2014why aren 't they responding to this? What is wrong? That startled me. Dr. O RNISH . Well, they are responding. That is why 40 insurance companies are now covering this program in the hospitals that wehave trained. But if HCFA, if Medicare were to cover this, thenmost of the other insurance companies would follow suit. That isreally the Rosetta Stone. That is where the leverage point is. Thatis where the opportunity for change is the greatest. If we can focus on the area where the cost savings were the most immediate and the most dramatic, then I am hoping it will be amuch smaller step for them to see that there is value in paying forpreventive services as well. But let 's start in an area that I think is where the cost savings can really be shown the most quickly andthe most dramatically. That is why we focused on that area, butit is by no means limited to that in terms of the benefits. Mrs. C HENOWETH . I have been frustrated because other alter- native forms of medicine, such as the practice of chiropracty andnaturopathy, and so forth, there seems to be so much manipulationin terms of what will be paid for and what won 't be paid for, and what takes certain approvals, and so forth. So I hoping that shortlywe will see people working together \u2014MD's working in consultation with other people who have an expertise in an area that they couldoffer great advice. That is my hope. In following up with the chairman 's comments, this 77 percent figure fascinated me. Doctor, does that mean that 23 percent of thepeople would be eligible and would need bypass or angioplastic sur-gery because they were the unstable candidate, those that may notlive for the next week or so? Dr. O RNISH . The patients, for whatever reason, 23 percent ended up getting operated on during that 3-year period. It was a 1-yearprogram. We followed them for 3 years. Now an interesting fact is that, because the cost differential be- tween a bypass and paying for lifestyle intervention is so great \u2014 it is, say, maybe $50,000 for a bypass and, say, $7,000 for a yearof lifestyle training \u2014if we just delayed surgery for a year and a half, and then 100 percent of people failed, the interest saved onthat $50,000 would more than cover the cost of a lifestyle program.We have certainly done a lot better than that. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May economic, hard-dollars standpoint, this makes sense. I would love to see coming out of these hearings two things. Onehas already been discussed, which is increased funding for re-search. I am a scientist. That is what I do. I have great apprecia-tion for the value of science to help sort out what works and whatdoesn 't work, and for whom and under what circumstances, so we can cut through a lot of the hype and say, what really is thescience here? The other thing that I would like to come out of this is that there are a few so-called alternative approaches, like what we have done,that have been proven to work, that are both medically effectiveand cost-effective. Let 's now take them to the level of reimburse- ment, which is where change really can happen. Then I think youwill find it will affect medical education, as well as medical prac-tice, as well as medical research. Mrs. C HENOWETH . Thank you, Doctor. Mr. B URTON . We are going to break for lunch for about 20 -25 minutes because I can hear people 's stomachs growling, and we have some food for the panelists along with some refreshments. But I would like to end up by asking you just one really hard question. Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . Do you believe, as a scientist and a doctor, that there is resistance from some areas of government and medicinebecause of the profit that is to be made by pharmaceutical compa-nies and the medical profession in performing these types of oper-ations and prescribing these types of medicines? Dr. O RNISH . Well, time for lunch. [Laughter.] Mr. B URTON . I don 't want to take too much time, but this is very serious, because there has been some suspicion among some of usin Congress that people who work at the Food and Drug Adminis-tration and at Health and Human Services have been influencedunduly by pharmaceutical companies, for instance. Many of themhave been paid fees for some forms of research. They have put onboards by some of the pharmaceutical companies, and that tie kindof concerns us, because what we want, as Members of the Con-gress, is the best quality of healthcare, whatever it is, for theAmerican people. That emanates, in part, from the pharmaceuticalcompanies and the research they do, but it also emanates from ho-listic approaches. So I am concerned that maybe our health agen-cies in the Federal Government might be unduly influenced, andthat is why I would like to have your opinion about that. Dr. O RNISH . Well, let me put it in a slightly different context. I think most doctors are genuinely interested in doing what is bestfor their patients. I believe the vast majority of doctors are gen-erally interested in service. But, at the same time, having beentrained very conventional \u2014you know, I went to medical school at Baylor and did my course surgery medical surgical rotation withMichael DeBakey, the eminent heart surgeon. I did my post-grad-uate training at Harvard and Mass. General, and I am at UCSFnow. I understand that training process, and I also understand how hard it is to be a doctor these days, when you are getting squeezedfrom all sides. If managed care says you have to see a new patient VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May minutes, even if you are interested in nutrition or dealing with the psychosocial and the emotional and spiritual dimensionsof health and well-being, you don 't have time to do it. In 7 minutes, you don 't have time to talk to about the problems with the mar- riage or the problems at work or the problems with the kids ondrugs, whatever it happens to be. You, basically, have time to lis-ten to the heart and lungs. You write a prescription for a choles-terol-lowering drug. You are on to the next patient. It is profoundly unsatisfying for most physicians and for most pa- tients. Most physicians, according to the latest surveys, which I amsure you have seen, wouldn 't recommend medicine as a career for their sons or daughters because it is not fun. Now we are trying to say, look, if you treat the cause of the prob- lem, if we change reimbursement, we offer different approaches. Ofcourse, there is an economic incentive the way things are set upnow, but why can 't there be an economic incentive to do things dif- ferently. We always have the money to pay the $50,000 for a by-pass. Why not the $7,000 for a year of lifestyle training, which isa whole team of people, not just a physician, but a dietician, an ex-ercise physiologist, a stress management instructor, a psychologist,and so on, to deal with the cause of the problem? If we can make it economically reimbursable, then we change those other incentives. Some patients do need surgery. Some pa-tients do benefit from drugs. But I think we also need to includethese other approaches which are of permanent benefit, which canreally empower the individual and make such a huge difference inboth their quality of lives and in their survival. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Dr. Ornish. That was a great state- ment, and it had some real political overtones. Have you thoughtabout entering politics? [Laughter.] Dr. O RNISH . Well, I am trying to build bridges here. Mr. B URTON . Yes, I know you are, and I appreciate that. We have some people from HCFA here, don 't we? Do we not? Don't we have somebody from the Department here? Can you come back and have lunch with us? I would like for Dr. Ornish and youand I to talk a little bit. OK, I think we will break now for about a half an hour and have a little bite to eat. You have to leave at 10 after 1? Dr. O RNISH . Yes, sir, but I just want to say, in closing, how grateful I am to you for organizing these hearings and for the op-portunity to be here today. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. We will reconvene in about 30 minutes.[Recess.]Mr. B URTON . We will reconvene. We will have other Members, I believe, coming back here shortly. They are running all over the place because there 's a number of hearings going on today. So I apologize for the people coming in and out. But I would like to have Dr. Brian Berman of the University of Maryland and Mr. Ollie Johnson and his lovely wife, Barbara, comeforward. We will have your testimony now. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 much your patience and hope you did get some- thing to eat. We normally don 't provide that service, but today we did. Why don 't we start with Dr. Berman? Dr. Berman, do you want to start and give us an opening statement? If you want to, you cansubmit your statement for the record, and then summarize. STATEMENTS OF BRIAN BERMAN, M.D., ASSOCIATE PRO- FESSOR AND DIRECTOR, PROGRAM FOR COMPLEMENTARYMEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND SCHOOL OF MEDI- CINE, BALTIMORE, MD; AND OLLIE AND BARBARA JOHNSON,DEAN ORNISH PATIENT AND SPOUSE, COLUM-BIA, SC Dr. B ERMAN . Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, I am extremely honored to be here today and giventhe opportunity to provide testimony to the Committee on Govern-ment Reform. I am a board-certified family physician and pain management specialist, and I am also trained in acupuncture and homeopathyat the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital. I went on to look atsome of these therapies and incorporate those into my practice be-cause I was frustrated that I didn 't have all the answers for my patients \u2014excellent training for acute care, trauma, but not for a lot of the chronic diseases that we see every day. I have been practicing integrated medicine for the past 17 years. I am also associate professor at the University of Maryland Schoolof Medicine and director of the complementary medicine programthere, and principal investigator on the National Institute ofHealth-funded Center for Alternative Medicine Pain Research andEvaluation, as well as CAM research grants from the NIH and theDepartment of Defense. So I have been asked to present today fromthe three perspectives as a clinician, as a researcher, and as an ad-visor to the government for the past 6 or so years. Our center was started in 1991, and we really started it because of some of the remarks that were made today. Back then, I reallyfelt that these types of therapies weren 't going to be brought into the mainstream of medicine unless there was a proven scientificbase to these therapies. So we started back then, in a time whenthere was a great deal of public interest, but the medical commu-nity's interest was low, if not hostile. As we all know, and it has been said today by you, there has been a great sea of change overthe past 7 or 8 years. It has gone from 3 in 10 to 4 in 10 Americansusing these therapies, and worldwide 75 percent of the world usesthese forms of therapy as their primary form of healthcare. In thiscountry, we see that there has been an increase in expenditures to$21 billion just for the providers ' side, and another $13 billion for the other out-of-pocket expenses of herbs, vitamins, books, and soforth. What has also changed over this period of time has been the gov- ernment 's support, and that started really with the opening of the Office of Alternative Medicine at the NIH in 1992, through the sup-port of Senator Harkins and others. Thanks to the efforts of thisCongress, now it has become a center with increased autonomy, in-creased budget, which has brought the much-needed funding or the VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 much-needed funding to an area that does not have ac- cess to the deep pockets of an industry, the sort of research anddevelopment industry, of a pharmaceutical industry that we havewith modern medicine. So I became involved with the Office of Alternative Medicine at its start through chairing the Ad Hoc Advisory Committee, the con-sensus meetings in Chantilly and then the report for the NIH ''Al- ternative Medicine: Expanding Medical Horizons Report, '' and as an advisory council member. Over these years, I have seen tremen-dous progress in the field. One has been the Office of AlternativeMedicine 's funding 11 centers of research, and that has started the infrastructure. Over the past 2 days, I was at meetings of the prin-cipal investigators, and the excitement to see people representingthe field of cancer, heart disease, pediatrics, pain, many areas,women 's health, and having from 7 to 10 projects, really getting out information that the Congress and the public really wanted to see. Pilot projects have been funded, and now definitive studies in several promising areas are underway, such as osteoarthritis oracupuncture in the use of osteoarthritis in the elderly, St. John 's Wort clinical trial, and some of these definitive studies that wehave all been wanting to see happen. At the University of Maryland we focus on the area of pain, and particularly the modalities of acupuncture and mind/body thera-pies. I would like to use these right now as an example of theprogress that has been made in some areas of complementary med-icine, and then give a picture of where they stand as regards thegovernment policy. We at our place are building a mosaic of information, of evidence, basic science information, looking at how does acupuncture actuallywork, studies ongoing there; randomized controlled trials. Is acu-puncture and mind/body therapy safe, effective for acute pain con-ditions such as post-operative dental pain, as well as chronic painproblems like osteoarthritis in the elderly, lower back pain,fibromyalgia? Also, what is going on in the actual clinical setting,tracking the outcomes and the real-life experience of patients? We are also collecting and evaluating the existing literature. One of the criticisms of complementary medicine, as we heard alludedto today, is the general lack of scientific evidence. We have foundand collected over 11,000 citations in complementary medicine andpain alone. The difficulty, in part, has been finding this literature,that it is in either foreign journals or nonmainstream journals. So our investigations to date, they paint the picture that acu- puncture and mind/body therapies, part of which we heard earlierby Dean Ornish, mind/body therapies and acupuncture have greatpotential, whether alone or as adjunct to therapies, for many of thepain problems. More research is needed to complete this pictureand fill in the gaps. While this research is important and the building block for prac- ticing evidence-based healthcare, how is it being brought into the public arena, where it can be useful in setting clinical guidelinesand affecting healthcare policy? Some of the things that have oc-curred \u2014back in 1994, the NIH and the FDA held a joint conference looking at acupuncture. The outcome of that meeting was that they VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May was enough evidence to say that acupuncture was no longer going to be listed as an experimental device. The NIH Acupuncture Consensus Conference was held in 1997. The outcome there was they found there was sufficient evidence toexpand its use into conventional medicine and to conduct futurestudies. They listed a whole range of conditions, from addiction, toasthma, to pain conditions, where there was fairly good evidence. There was also a Technology Assessment Conference in Mind/ Body Therapies for Pain and Insomnia, held through the NationalInstitutes of Health, for which I was a panel member. There thefindings were that there was strong evidence for treating a widerange of chronic pain conditions. Both conferences recommended these therapies be covered by healthcare payers. This is far from the reality today. So the recur-ring theme of coverage comes up. Insurers and healthcare compa-nies, they put them on today sometimes as additional riders or re-duced rates. Over the 7-year increase in patients usage that wesaw from those surveys, there wasn 't any change in the coverage. What about the government-funded healthcare programs? I would like to just give you a quick story about one of my patients.Before I came here, last week when I was preparing for this testi-mony, one of my patients, an elderly gentleman with chronic backpain, whose insurance is Medicare, called me, and he said, ''I won 't be able to come for treatment any longer. '' Now he had tried all the conventional treatments for his chronic back pain without success.He came to me. We treated him with acupuncture. Maryland hasacupuncture licensing laws. I am licensed in the State of Marylandto practice acupuncture. He benefited greatly over the course ofabout 4 months ' time. Now he has to come back and say, it is not going to be covered, so he has to go back to the treatment whichhe had before, physical therapy, which really didn 't benefit him. And as a side, there isn 't much in the way of strong evidence to show the efficacy of physical therapy for chronic back pain. At the end of the day, who is being served by this? Certainly, not the patient, who now has to give up an effective treatment for him,and certainly not Medicare. I think it is time to start consideringcomplementary and alternative medicine as viable healthcare op-tions in our healthcare system. So how do we do this? With over 200 modalities under this broad umbrella ''complementary medicine, '' it could seem an over- whelming task to know what information there is, which treat-ments merit consideration based on solid evidence. At our univer-sity, part of our program, one of our main efforts has been in gath-ering the best information and trying to disseminate that. Part of that effort is through the Cochrane Collaboration, which is an international organization dedicated to evaluating all medicaltherapies. So we are coordinating this international field for com-plementary medicine as part of the Cochrane Collaboration, andthrough these efforts, there now exists a specialized registry of ran-domized controlled trials that is available worldwide of about 4,000clinical studies and another 4,000 we are considering. We and others worldwide are involved with reviewing this evi- dence with a systemic review and then drawing conclusions thatcan help guide clinical decisions and future research. There have VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May of these reviews completed, and it is this type of informa- tion that can help guide the integration of complementary medicineinto the mainstream. So, in conclusion Mr. Chairman, I offer the following: We need continued proactive funding by the government. Most complemen-tary alternative medicine therapies are not patentable, and there-fore, of little interest to industry. We need to continue to inves-tigate the safety, efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and use the full rangeof methodologies from randomized controlled trials to basic sciencesto health services research. No. 2, we need quality information that is succinct and evidence- based made available to the public, to researchers, payers, and pol-icymakers. No. 3, based on this research and quality information, we need to make complementary therapy more accessible, especially tothose with little disposable income. I think this can be accom-plished, one, through coverage, through Medicaid/Medicare, and,two, through setting up demonstration programs at places like theVA system, military medicine, the Bureau of Primary Health Care. Then, last is setting up the President 's commission. There was language to set up the President 's commission. I think we should go forward with that. I think that will help us facilitate other gov-ernment agencies become involved in this field. I think the continued interest and support of your committee and other government programs will help ensure that ours and futuregenerations benefit from the availability of effective healthcare ap-proaches, regardless of whether they are labeled alternative, com-plementary, or conventional. Thank you very much.[The prepared statement of Dr. Berman follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I have some questions, but we will go ahead and hear the other panelists, and I will ask you about those in just amoment. Mrs. Johnson, ladies before gentlemen.Ms. B ARBARA JOHNSON . Thank you. Mr. B URTON . Would you pull the microphone pretty close? Thank you very much. Ms. B ARBARA JOHNSON . Mr. Chairman, members of the com- mittee, thank you for the kind invitation to allow me to testify atthis hearing today. My name is Barbara Johnson, and I have beenmy family 's caregiver for 42 years. I appreciate the opportunity to share with you mine and Ollie 's journey to the Dr. Dean Ornish 's Program for Heart Disease Reversal. In 1987, my husband, Ollie Johnson, was diagnosed with heart disease. He had a heart catheterization at Richland Memorial Hos-pital in Columbia, SC, which showed that he had a 70 percentblockage in one artery and a 90 percent blockage in another. Hisdoctor did not think that he was a candidate for any kind of sur-gery, so he prescribed medication for him. All of the medicationwas provided by the pharmacy at Moncrief Army Hospital at Ft.Jackson, SC, since Ollie is retired from the Air Force. At my insistence, the doctor also provided a way for Ollie to go to the cardiac rehab program at the University of South Carolina.On my own, I bought cookbooks which were recommended by theAmerican Heart Association, because we didn 't really get any nutri- tional information from the doctor, and started cooking, ''heart healthy. '' We stopped eating beef and ate chicken, pork, and fish. We stuck to this regimen for several years. He exercised periodi-cally by walking 3 to 5 miles a week. In 1991, I began to see Dr. Dean Ornish on various talk shows and became intrigued with his program. I bought his book, ''Dr. Dean Ornish 's Program for Reversing Heart Disease, '' and knew that the program would work for us. When Ollie had his next regularly scheduled appointment with his cardiologist, we mentioned the book and program to him, andexpressed a keen interest in trying it. The doctor quickly dismissedus and said, ''You can 't do that program. It 's too harsh. '' I did not believe this, but was powerless against his suggestion. So for thenext 4 years, we followed the American Heart Association diet witha 30 percent fat intake. By June 1995, when Ollie had his yearly checkup, it was discov- ered that his heart disease had gotten worse, and now a third ar-tery had significant blockage. Knowing that the Dean Ornish pro-gram would stop the progression of the disease, I asked the doctorwhat did we need to do to stop the disease from getting any worse.By this time, the Richland Memorial Hospital offered the program.The doctor said that the only way that he knew of to get the dis-ease to stop was to enroll in the Ornish program. So I asked himto please get us in the next class, and he did. We started the program in July 1995. For the first 3 months, we were required to go to the hospital 3 nights a week for lectures, ex-ercise, stress management, and supper. This is how we learned tolive the program. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 point, our family members were invited to the hospital and they were given information on the program. Their questionswere answered, and we all had a meal together. This event was in-valuable to us because it emphasized the value of staying with theprogram and how family support was so important. I do not have heart disease, but I entered the program to support my husband and to ensure his success. In our home we eat and livethe Ornish lifestyle. When we started the program in July, we weretold that Ollie 's insurance, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, would not pay for our participation. We had to pay $5,000 for Ollie and $1,000 forme. We paid $3,000 down and were given 2 years to pay off theremaining $3,000. We paid a monthly payment to the hospital. During the first year in the program, we faithfully stayed in com- pliance with all of the dietary, exercise, and stress management re-quirements. We filled out program compliance sheets daily andmailed them to the hospital monthly. We actually filled out theseforms for 3 years. The first year was a year of learning \u2014learning how to cook so that meals were tasty and satisfying. We also had to give ourselves time to adjust to the new lifestyle. Travel and eating out were challenges that we were up to andslowly but surely mastered. During the first 2 12years, whenever we traveled, we took an electric cooler and a two-burner stove andall of our food with us. If we couldn 't find a restaurant to serve us, we would cook in our hotel room. We made this fun and never sawit as a hardship. After 3 years, I am very good at preparing our meals and we are both energetic and healthy. Ollie walks 15 to 20 miles a week andlifts weights three times a week. I walk 30 to 35 miles a week,work out at the gym on weight machines three times a week, andtake an aerobics class twice a week. And by the way, I am in train-ing for the Cooper River Bridge Race. Another plus of this program is that our food bill has gone down dramatically. When you do not have to buy meat, you realize a sub-stantial savings at the grocery store. When Ollie had the thallium stress test and blood work after 1 year, his test results were so favorable that his doctor took him offthe Procardia and reduced the Tenormin from 50 milligrams to 25milligrams daily, and the doctor tells us on the side that he doesn 't really think Ollie needs the Tenormin, but he is scared to take himoff of it. Eliminating the Procardia amounted to a savings of $40 a month to the U.S. Army. The current cost of Tenormin is less than 1 centper day. Every thallium stress test that he has had since then hasbeen more favorable each year. The hospital had been sending Ollie 's medical test results and our compliance sheets to the insurance provider. After we had paidon the remaining $3,000 for 13 months, the insurance companypaid off the balance. The insurance provider currently pays forsome patients to participate in the program. However, when we en-tered the program, the insurance provider would only pay if theparticipant had previously had a heart attack, bypass surgery,angioplasty, or stints. We are fortunate and grateful that the Dr. Dean Ornish program is available in Columbia. In July 1995, Columbia was one of only VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May in the United States. However, there is a need for this program to be available throughout the United States. I be-lieve that participation in this program has eliminated the poten-tial of my husband having a heart attack or bypass or some otherkind of invasive measure. I wholeheartedly recommend that this,the Dean Ornish program, be authorized under Medicare. I thank you for your attention, and I will be glad to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Mrs. Johnson follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 you care to comment? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I 'm Ollie John- son, and I am the patient here. I appreciate the opportunity toshare with you my experiences overcoming my heart disease andalso my thoughts as a taxpayer. It is very sobering when one is told, ''You are going to have a heart attack. '' I was told that by my cardiologist, and later by a nurse while I was in the cardiac rehab. unit at the University ofSouth Carolina. Fortunately, at this time in my life I feel very cer-tain that it is not going to happen. My initial attempt to seek treatment in 1987 was at the Moncrief Army Hospital at Ft. Jackson. I was seen by a clinical nurse whoadministered an at-rest EKG. There were no visible symptomssince I was not put under stress. Consequently, I was told that Ihad no problem. We were not satisfied with this diagnosis, and subsequently, saw my current cardiologist, who at that time diagnosed blockage aftera more thorough examination and verification by cardiac catheter-ization. After completing the cardiac rehabilitation in 1987 andchanging my lifestyle, the possibility of a heart episode still re-mained. When I started the Dean Ornish program to reverse heartdisease in 1995, initial tests showed that my heart disease had pro-gressed, but simply at a slower pace. After the first 6 months in the Ornish program, tests showed a significant lowering of my cholesterol levels, favorable levels of myHDL, LDL, and triglycerides. This was viewed by the Heart Centerstaff as the environment in which reversal takes place. After 1 year, the progression of my disease completely stopped. After the second year, there was evidence that the area served bythe blockage was getting more blood. After the third year, evenmore blood flow was noted. In addition, my ischemia had dis-appeared. My cardiologist commented that, if you didn 't know that I had heart disease, he could not tell from my electrocardiogram stresstest. I feel confident that my disease is being cured, and that I willnot require a catastrophic heart procedure. I am healthy and ener-getic. I walk 15 to 20 miles a week. I meditate for 1 hour 4 to 6days each week, and I adhere to the Ornish diet. My wife and I are involved in our community. I do part-time con- sulting work. We travel, occasionally visit and enjoy our grand-children, and enjoy our lifestyles. I would be remiss if I did not thank the many people who have helped save my life. Dr. Dean Ornish, who invented and developedthis program, and weathered the rocky road to get this programwidely accepted; the Heart Center at Palmetto Richland MemorialHospital for making this program available in South Carolina; themedical directors, Drs. Don Sanders and Joe Collins; my cardiolo-gist, Dr. Stephen Humphrey; the wonderful staff at the Heart Cen-ter: Susan Bevron, who coordinated the Ornish program when weentered it; Colleen Wracker, a nutrition specialist who patientlytaught us how to eat Ornish and answered all of our many ques-tions; Brent Schell, our stress management specialist, and JeanHumphrey, our group support volunteer \u2014and last, but by no means least, my wife, Barbara Johnson, who determined long be- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May knew that this was the program that would save my life. She is my advocate, my cook, my motivator, my caregiver, and she isthe mother of my children. I am truly blessed, and I am gratefulfor this program. I just want to share with you as a taxpayer that I feel very strongly that when the government invests in the health and well-being of its citizens, there should be specific outcomes. The pro-gram should have a favorable impact on the society that it serves.It should be cost-effective, and it should be measurable. I believe that the Dr. Dean Ornish Lifestyle Program meets these outcomes. I am healthier. There is evidence that my blockage is re-gressing, and I am avoiding a catastrophic bypass procedure costof about $45,000 to me and my insurance carrier. I have some data from the South Carolina Budget and Control Board, Office of Research and Statistics. These figures show car-diac procedures, angioplasty and bypass, and their average costsfor the period October 1997 through September 1998. There were6,587 procedures at a cost of more than $228 million. If one-fourthof that population had early access to, and embraced, the DeanOrnish Heart Disease Reversal Program, there was a potential sav-ings of more than $57 million in medical costs within South Caro-lina; and, 1,646 people might have avoided catastrophic invasiveprocedures. I would certainly urge this distinguished panel to support Medi- care coverage of this program. I thank you for allowing me to par-ticipate. I will answer any of your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Johnson follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Thank you, Mr. Johnson. Your wife must be an ex- traordinary woman, as well as a good cook. Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Yes, she is. Mr. B URTON . Mr. Sanford ought to be very proud of you as con- stituents, because you make a very strong case, and you are exam-ples of what people ought to do to make sure their lifestyles areenhanced. So congratulations. Let me just ask you a couple of questions, and then I will yield to Mr. Sanford. What is your cholesterol level now?Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . 196 or 195. Mr. B URTON . Is that right, below 200? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Oh, yes, it has been down to 170, but I had some tests last week and it was about 195 or 190, somewhere inthere. Mr. B URTON . Your LDL and HDL are at acceptable levels as well? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . They are all in acceptable levels, yes. Mr. B URTON . What were they before? Do you recall? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . I don 't know because I didn 't pay too much attention to it until I got them, and when I first was checked, itwas 3 or 4 months into the program; they had all just kind of got-ten into compliance. Mr. B URTON . What about your blood pressure? Is it pretty good? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Yes, my blood pressure \u2014they have to sort of wake me up. Mr. B URTON . 120 over 80 or \u2014\u2014 Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Yes, it is usually somewhere at 120 over 80, 78. Mr. B URTON . But it was higher than that when you first started taking Tenormin, I guess? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Yes. Yes, it was higher than that. But I haven 't had a problem in 312years. Mr. B URTON . Did you take Zocor or any of the cholesterol-control- ling drugs at any time? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . No. I took Procardia that dilutes your blood vessels. They took me off that medication and they reduced myTenormin from 50 milligrams to 25 milligrams. Right now I amtaking 25 milligrams of Tenormin and a baby aspirin, and I takea multiple vitamin. Mr. B URTON . But the doctor really doesn 't even think you need those; it is just a precaution? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . That is correct. He doesn 't really think I need that, but he won 't take me off of it. Mr. B URTON . OK, very good. Well, I can tell you right now that we are going to be having meetings with Dean Ornish and peopleat HCFA. I have already talked to some of the people over thereabout that. It sounds like to me that there is not a lot of oppositionover at Health and Human Services and HCFA to the Ornish pro-gram. The problem, I guess, it looks like to me, is that we needsome legislation to enable them to approve this program being paidfor by the Medicare system. If we can get HCFA and Health andHuman Services, FDA, and everybody onboard, then it seems to mewe ought to be able to get the Congress to go along with that. We VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May able to get that done. So maybe your wish and Dr. Ornish 's wishes, will be realized before too long. Anyhow, we are going to be meeting with them in the not-too-distant future. I would like to ask Dr. Berman a couple of questions about the acupuncture. You said in your testimony that \u2014I may be para- phrasing what you said \u2014but, because it is not profitable, a lot of the companies are not interested in this, or a lot of the providersare not interested in this. Maybe you could clarify that. I mighthave \u2014\u2014 Dr. B ERMAN . I think what I was saying was that a lot of these therapies or complementary alternative medicines are not patent-able. So because there is no patent, there is no great incentive fora drug company to put the amount of money that it takes to gothrough the steps to have it. So, therefore, they don 't really get evaluated and taken to that sort of stage from people 's observa- tions \u2014yes, it seems to work anecdotally \u2014all the way through to the clinical trials that we need. I was more talking about that research dollars are really needed, and it is not going to come from \u2014a lot of our research is from the drug industry, and that is where a lot of the dollars come from. Mr. B URTON . Do you think that some of the opposition to the pro- cedures that you provide comes from pharmaceutical companies be-cause there is no real profit incentive? Dr. B ERMAN . We are back to that question again. Mr. B URTON . Well, you know, I ask that question, and I asked it of Dean Ornish, and the reason I ask it is because it is very im-portant that we get that out in the open. That is not something youcan hide behind, because if agencies of the Federal Government arebeing controlled, in part even, by pharmaceutical companies, be-cause they invest large amounts of moneys in research, and theyare afraid their research dollars are going to go down the tube be-cause somebody finds bark off a tree that is going to cure cancer,instead of their product, then if they have that kind of influence,it is unseemingly. I think in the process \u2014and I am going to go off on a little tirade here\u2014I think in the process of getting alternative therapies accept- ed, we may have to, as a government, figure out some way to pro-tect pharmaceutical companies against making great investmentsin scientific research, and then have something come along thatdidn't cost anything that knocks their research out of the box, and there is maybe $2 or $3 billion that has gone down the tubes. I am sympathetic to the problem that they face. If they patent something, they go through all the research; they come up with acompound that works, and then somebody comes up with some-thing that is homeopathic that works just as well, but doesn 't cost anything. So they are out all that money. So I am sympathetic tothat. But, at the same time, I think we need to know in the Congress if pharmaceutical companies, if medical facilities in this countryare using their influence to keep a lid on alternative therapies, sothat they can still make the almighty dollar. Dr. B ERMAN . I think that does exist. I think we would have to say straight that there is a great profit motive, and it is not therefor many of these therapies. So while some of them are now \u2014quite VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 of the big pharmaceutical companies are starting to look at this field, they are coming along with a big net to see where is themarket, and beginning to start their own lines of vitamins andminerals, and have not yet gone the other way to say, let 's put in the research dollars, because of these concerns: Where is that pat-ent going to be, and their payout at the end of the line. Mr. B URTON . Well, perhaps we can wade through that and figure out some way to be able to encourage them, so that they can makemoney and still get to the final conclusion we all want. Let me ask you a little bit about acupuncture, because I am not that familiar with it. How does it work on joints and pain? If youuse acupuncture, for instance, if you have knee problems or tenniselbow or shoulder problems or back problems, does it give long-last-ing relief or is it just a temporary thing, like aspirin or acetamino-phen or something? Dr. B ERMAN . What we have found is that it generally, in the be- ginning, the treatments are maybe \u2014if somebody has a chronic problem \u2014if it is an acute problem, often it lasts. But if it is a chronic disease, let 's say, like somebody with osteoarthritis of the knees, and they have had this for many, many years. Initially, youmay find that the treatments last for just a couple of days, andthen as you go along, if this treatment is working for this par-ticular patient, they tend to last longer and longer, and there ismore of a carryover effect. From some of our studies, it has lastedsort of for 12 weeks before we saw any decrease in the effects fromthe treatment. Mr. B URTON . Does it ever provide a complete cure or is it just like some kind of pharmaceutical that would provide a cure for ashort period of time, and you have to take it again? Dr. B ERMAN . Well, in the traditional way of looking at it, they would say the cure might be that you come in once a season even-tually, and it has to do with not just your local knee pain, but yourgeneral health. Whether or not it can \u2014it really depends on which problem. I mean, I have seen it cure tennis elbow quite effectivelyand some problems of chronic headaches. But something where it is really \u2014looking at osteoarthritis, part of the joint is gone, and they are waiting to have joint replacement,it is not going to regenerate that joint. There is some evidence thatglucosamine and some of the other compounds might have some ef-fect there, but for acupuncture you are not going to regenerate it,but you will decrease the inflammation around that joint. You willdecrease the pain, and you will increase the quality of life, so thatthe person is really perhaps able to not have the surgery or avoidhaving the surgery. Mr. B URTON . Very good. Mr. Sanford.Mr. S ANFORD . I guess I would ask this of my fellow South Caro- linians. We grew up not only in the Sunbelt, but in the stroke beltas well. Growing up where we did, I have a particular love of friedchicken, country fried steak, fried okra. My hope that is, as youlook at the Ornish program, a part of it is what you eat; a part ofit what you do in terms of exercise, and a part of it, I suppose, iswhat you think with meditation, and maybe there are other ele-ments in terms of herbs. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 it is the nutrition part? Can I skip out on the nutri- tion part and still be OK, or, no, it is all three? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . It is all of them. We asked that question. It is like we can only have one drink a day. I asked, could I savethem up until Saturday? They said, no, you can 't. [Laughter.] But the food part, we don 't eat meat; we don 't eat seafood. We go to a restaurant and we talk to the cook or we say, ''Look, can you fix up the meal? '' They will say, ''We can fix you a vegetarian meal. '' But if they are going to put ''fat-back '' into it, we have a problem there. So we actually just leave. Mr. S ANFORD . So is it equal, a third, a third, a third, or is it real- ly more relying on what you eat than anything else? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . No, sir. I don 't know that they have an an- swer for that, because we never got one that is one-fourth exercise,one-fourth meditation, one-fourth diet, and one-fourth group sup-port. I don 't believe they have any evidence to say which is the most influential. We have not at this point. So we do all of it. Wedo all of it, and it is working. Mr. S ANFORD . What would you say to folks that say \u2014detractors, in essence, of alternative medicine who say, wait a minute, theFederal Government can only fund so many things. This is notmagic. I know that fried okra probably isn 't the best thing in the world for me, but I grew up eating it; I love eating it. In other words, since it is not magic, since I know it is not good for me, therefore, you could have figured this out earlier. Whatshouldn 't government involvement be reserved for the very end of things? In other words, what would you say to a detractor thatsaid, only so many dollars; save it for the end because people, ifthey are really disciplined, could be doing this stuff without havinggovernment involved in a program of Dean Ornish or others? Mr. O LLIE JOHNSON . Well, I think the evidence of it, good or bad, is the cost in South Carolina right now, $228 million, just last yearalone. All of those people \u2014I didn 't have any figures on what their ages were, but I would suspect that they are maybe older people.I sort of crossed that bridge. I have a lot of friends who still eatKentucky Fried Chicken, or ''KFC '' now \u2014we don 't say, ''fried '' any- more. [Laughter.] And we don 't perceive it as being a hard thing. It is really very difficult to convince another person that this is a good way that isnot so bad. Most of my friends do not eat Ornish, and they knowI eat Ornish. We go to a restaurant, and I may end up eating asalad, but that is it. Every now and then, when they say, ''Your weight, you look pretty good, '' I say, ''Well, it is part of the program that I am in. '' They will ask me a few more questions. I know that they are eating better. They probably gave up the double ham-burgers and stuff like that, and they are eating more turkey, be-cause they see me every day and they believe that something ishappening with that guy; he is a better person because I know he is meditating. He is a little bit better to get along with. So I don 't criticize their lifestyle. I am willing to tell them about mine. Mr. S ANFORD . Right. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 I have had that question, ''Well, I can 't do that because I am enjoying this lifestyle, '' but we are both at the concert or the theater, you see. Mr. S ANFORD . I would ask the question, I suppose, to Mr. Ber- man, unless you want to throw in your thoughts. That is, howwould you guard against quackery, though? In other words, if youopen up government to doing a lot of other things, surely, therewould be a lot of folks that maybe \u2014AMA has pretty strict guide- lines. How you have an AMA-like control over who does or doesn 't do acupuncture or herbal remedy? Dr. B ERMAN . There is a lot of efforts in that way. There is certifi- cation. You look at certification, regulation, licensing, education,experience, and there are the acupuncturists, the chiropractors,massage therapists, they do have national \u2014and many of the States have their own regulations. So you would go look at that. I thinkthat is very important. You could set up many things. You could set up looking at the adverse reactions of many of these therapies, so you could look atwhat goes on with them adversely. And you would also continue todo the research, so you could separate out what doesn 't work and discard those, and then keep in the ones that do work. So I think there are many ways that we could really improve, both from a conventional as well as a complementary medicineside, to separate out the quackery. Mr. S ANFORD . Mr. Chairman, thank you. Mr. B URTON . Thank you. I would just like to say, Mr. Sanford, that we had Dean Ornish in earlier, and, of course, I think youwere in other committee meetings or something. I hope that youand some of the other members will take advantage of an invita-tion Dean Ornish made, and that was that he said he would bewilling to come back from San Francisco to meet with a numberof Congressmen to tell them about his specific program, and if youare interested, get you on it, because it has had substantial results. In addition to that, they have scientific research in his program that backs up, in Dean Ornish 's case, what these people have said here today, that it does eliminate in many cases, but certainly re-duces the necessity for heart surgery and bypass surgery and alsoangioplasty. They estimated that it would save $30,000 to $35,000for each case. When you put a pencil to that, if we could get Healthand Human Service, HCFA, and all the health agencies to incor-porate this into Medicare, it would probably save billions of dollarsfor the Medicare program that could be well used elsewhere. It isone of the things that I know that you will want to work with us,and I will talk to you about that. Let me just thank you very much. I am going to have to find out, Mrs. Johnson, what you cook that tastes so good that doesn 't have cholesterol in it. [Laughter.] Maybe I can get you to come to Indiana and teach me and my family. But, anyhow, I am just teasing you. Thank you very much for being here, and I am sorry you had to wait so long. We will take to heart what you said. We are goingto meet with Dean Ornish. What you are requesting is going to belooked into very thoroughly and, hopefully, we will get some resultson it. So thank you very much. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 We are going to check into the acupunc- ture. I may be talking to you about acupuncture myself. Dr. B ERMAN . OK. Mr. B URTON . Why don 't we have the next panel come forward? We will get started with the next panel. We are going to have a vote coming up here right now.The next panel is Dr. Kamerow, Dr. Holohan, and Dr. Mazzuchi.Dr. Kamerow, we talked earlier today. You know, Dr. Kamerow, I only wish the Army had as nice of uniforms as you guys. I wasin the Army and our uniforms never could measure up to you orthe Marines. Why don 't we start with Dr. Kamerow, since we will just go from left to right? Did I mention everybody or did I leave someone out? Mr. M AZZUCHI . Dr. Zimble is here with me, sir. He is the presi- dent of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences. Mr. B URTON . Oh, Doctor, well, I apologize for that. OK. Dr. Kamerow. STATEMENTS OF DOUGLAS KAMEROW, M.D., DIRECTOR, CEN- TER FOR HEALTH CARE TECHNOLOGY, AGENCY FORHEALTH CARE POLICY RESEARCH, DEPARTMENT OFHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES; THOMAS V. HOLOHAN, M.D.,CHIEF, PATIENT CARE SERVICES OFFICER, VETERANSHEALTH ADMINISTRATION; JOHN F. MAZZUCHI, DEPUTY AS-SISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR HEALTH AFFAIRS,CLINICAL AND PROGRAM POLICY, DEPARTMENT OF DE-FENSE; AND JIM ZIMBLE, M.D., PRESIDENT OF THE UNI- FORMED SERVICES UNIVERSITY FOR THE HEALTHSCIENCES Dr. K AMEROW . Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the com- mittee. I am Dr. Douglas Kamerow, testifying on behalf of the De-partment of Health and Human Services. Our Department, HHS,has a number of roles related to complementary and alternativemedicine. NIH, the National Institutes of Health, facilitates re-search into new health therapies that may someday be options forthe treatment of illnesses. FDA, the Food and Drug Administra-tion, is responsible for approving new medical devices or drugs thatare safe and effective in the treatment and prevention of disease. I work in another public health service agency, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, AHCPR. Unlike my colleagues onthe panel here today, we at AHCPR neither deliver care nor regu-late care. Our mission is to access the evidence for what works andwhat does not work in healthcare. We support and conduct research that improves the quality, the outcomes, and the appropriate use of healthcare services. We pro-vide the scientific foundation that is necessary for informedhealthcare decisions. We want those decisions, which are beingmade every day by patients, by clinicians, by purchasers,healthcare system leaders, and policymakers, to be based on solidevidence about what works, when it works, and for whom it works. The study of complementary and alternative medicine is squarely within AHCPR 's mission. While we have done some work in this area, we have really just begun to look at it. Let me tell you a lit- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 3 minutes ' worth, of what it is that we have done and what we are doing. First, we are working to provide accurate statistics about the use of complementary and alternative medicine in the United States.One of our surveys, the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, has col-lected information on persons who consult with complementary andalternative medicine providers. This is the largest available surveyof persons who have used alternative care, and when we release re-sults, they will provide the most accurate estimates yet about theuse of complementary and alternative care providers. Second, we supported a number of early studies on the effective- ness and cost-effectiveness of alternative therapies for treatment oflow back pain, including chiropractic, acupuncture, and spinal ma-nipulation. We have also evaluated patient satisfaction with theircare compared to patients treated with conventional therapies. Third, we are working closely with our colleagues at NIH, at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, toco-sponsor two studies on acupuncture: one looking at the effective-ness of acupuncture on back pain and, second, in treating depres-sion during pregnancy. Fourth and finally, we are helping to document and synthesize the scientific and clinical evidence that supports complementaryand alternative medicine. In 1997, we established 12 evidence-based practice centers around North America to systematicallyanalyze important clinical topics. Let me give you one example. I am a family physician. A patient recently asked me about using garlic preparations to help reduce his blood pressure and his cho-lesterol. I was frustrated because there really was nowhere I couldturn for reliable information about this substance, which is com-monly used in this country and abroad. I am pleased to say thatnow we at AHCPR have commissioned what we call an evidence re-port on garlic. One of our EPCs will scour the world 's literature about it, systematically review that research, and authoritativelytell us what is known about what works and what doesn 't work about garlic. In addition to this report, we are also reviewing other com- plementary and alternative medicine topics for future reports, andwe are discussing further collaboration with our colleagues at NIH. Now AHCPR is a small agency, and therefore our investment in this area only scratches the surface. What is needed to create thescientific foundation for CAM, for complementary and alternativemedicine? We need to develop better, more reliable methods forstudying and evaluating these therapies, and much more researchis needed on their effectiveness and outcomes. We need to increasethe available data on their use, and we need to know how patientsfeel about the care they receive and why. We at AHCPR believe that the best evaluation of medical care is one that measures the impact on the outcomes that patients careabout and what they care about most. The bottom line is that allof us \u2014doctors, other health professionals, patients, health systems, and payers \u2014need evidence. We need to know what works and for VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May at AHCPR to provide this evidence. These ef- forts will allow us to identify complementary and alternative thera-pies that improve health, improve health care, and enhance thequality of life of our patients. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Kamerow follows:] VerDate Thank you, Doctor. We have 5 minutes before this vote expires. So I apologize to the panelists. I mean, how would you like to live this life where yourun back and forth? The only good thing about it \u2014\u2014 Dr. K AMEROW . Exercise. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. Is exercise, yes. We will be back in 5 or 10 minutes. [Recess.]Mr. B URTON . We will reconvene. Thank you, Dr. Kamerow, for your testimony.We will hear from Dr. Mazzuchi now.Mr. M AZZUCHI . Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just high- light some pieces of my testimony for you, in the interest of time. Mr. B URTON . Thank you, Doctor. Mr. M AZZUCHI . One of the questions that you had asked that I cover in my testimony, and I have covered it in some detail in thewritten testimony, deals with a chiropractic demonstration pro-gram that the Department of Defense is operating in response tothe Defense Authorization Act of 1995. We now have 13 sites. Weuse two different models: a patient choice model and a managedcare model. In addition to those 13 sites, we have 3 comparison-sites where we also ask similar questions to patients who are un-dergoing care, but from traditional providers, and not the chiro-practic providers. The data-gathering phase of that will continuethrough September 30, 1999, and then we will report to Congress,which we are required to do by the act, which requires us to reporton both the feasibility and the advisability of adopting the chiro-practic care into the military health system. We don 't have enough data for me to give you the answer to that yet, but I can say, from the information that we have gathered,that the patients who are receiving chiropractic care are quitepleased with that care. In my opinion, one of the most beneficial aspects of complemen- tary and alternative medicine is that these therapies tend to focuson self-care and stress a balance in living. We in the DOD continueto initiate and implement programs that recognize that personalhealth behaviors are extremely important in reducing the incidenceand severity of disease, injury, and disability. The first step in any comprehensive healthcare plan to promote a healthy lifestyle is to evaluate current health status. The HealthEnrollment Evaluation Assessment Review [HEAR], is an age-ap-propriate tool that surveys the general health status of each of ourbeneficiaries. The HEAR gathers information on current health sta-tus, family medical history, currency of immunizations, preventionscreenings, mental health, use of alcohol and drugs, et cetera, andhas become a very important instrument to us as we look at life-style, so that we can initiate prevention programs that meet theneeds of our population both individually and our population as awhole. Let me address the fact that you asked about training of our DOD providers. Overall, there are many elements of CAM offeredin DOD facilities throughout our Department. Our physicians havebeen trained in acupuncture techniques. They have been appro- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 treat patients with acupuncture in DOD facilities. For example, selected providers at both Walter Reed Army Med- ical Center and Andrews Air Force Base, both here in Washington,at the Family Practice Clinic, treat patients who have chronic painwith acupuncture. Another example: a radiation oncologist assigned to Edwards Air Force Base conducts an acupuncture practice every morning in hispractice and has accommodated about 1,200 visits for the treat-ment of pain, smoking cessation, and obesity. Many of our hospitals and clinics offer stress management pro- grams that include relaxation training, visualization, breathingtechniques, exercise information, and cognitive therapies. Our psy-chology clinics within the Department offer biofeedback and otherbehavioral modification services. Some mental health professionalsand other staff use meditation techniques with our patients. T 'ai Chi, for instance, is used by some of our facilities as a routine forrelaxation therapy. Many therapies considered to be complementary or alternative have not been adopted as mainstream medicine because of the cur-rent lack of evidence for their scientific support for their efficacyand safety. We are held accountable to a particular standard forthe services we cover outside of our medical treatment facilities. And just so that you understand, we have a military health sys- tem that involves not only the MTFs, or the medical treatment fa-cilities, that we ourselves run and operate, but we also have amanaged care program as well as the standard CHAMPUS pro-gram, which is a piece of that program, that offers care outside ofour facilities. So what we can cover on the outside is governed by a standard that requires us to show the cost-effectiveness and scientific effi-cacy and safety of those products. Inside the house, we do have ourphysician community who are trained in many CAM techniques.They do actually provide those techniques within our healthcaresystem, but we do not pay for them outside of our system. To uphold our accountability, we have regulations and program policies that restrict covered benefits. However, the DOD will fol-low very carefully the research done through institutions such asthe Office of Alternative Medicine within the National Institutes ofHealth, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences,and programs of other medical schools, such as the one we heardabout at the University of Maryland 's Complementary Medicine Center, for answers to the questions that CAM therapies pose tous. Many of our beneficiaries are interested in complementary and alternative medicine, and our providers realize that within eachperson there is the natural recuperative power that is the key toall healing, and that taking charge of one 's own health and well- being, both physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually, iswithin the grasp of each of us. Moreover, the Department does not restrict the practice of pro- viders who are knowledgeable, willing, and able to provide alter-native medicine therapies to their patients. The spectrum of CAM,however, is broad, involving many things, and the truth is that VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May no one single definition that can clearly define what is al- ternative medicine. Moreover, the line between what is alternativemedicine and mainstream therapy is not consistently clear in theminds of patients and providers alike. We remain a society that is built upon science and depended upon science to solve many of the problems that we, as well as ourfuture generations, will be facing. As therapies which are currentlyconsidered complementary or alternative are tested and shown tobe safe, efficacious, and cost-effective, they will be integrated intothe DOD health system. Dr. Zimble is with me here today. He is the president of the Uni- formed Services University and is here to talk about two particularaspects that you asked in your program, mainly, medical schooltraining, since he operates our military medical school, as well asthe Dean Ornish Demonstration Project, which funds were justtransferred this week, so we can move on with that \u2014if Dr. Zimble would like to do that. Dr. Z IMBLE . Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you very much for allowing me to be a strap-hanger with Dr. Mazzuchi. I havelearned a great deal here today about the sense of this committeeand, also, some of the great contributions that are being toward theintegration more and more into mainstream medicine. We have started at the Armed Services University interest in CAM in 1994, when we began seminars for the complementary andalternative medicine. We have had about 64 seminars since thattime in 1994. Also, in 1996, we had what I consider to be a really good begin- ning in getting involvement of other medical schools and schools ofnursing into an interest in CAM. We held a 3-day Consensus Con-ference with representation from about 33 different institutions,looking at various aspects of all types of alternative/complementarymedicine, including workshops by many of the practitioners. Now we are beginning an elective 4th-year curriculum to teach complementary medicine and then alternative medicine. We haveabout 13 research projects, protocols, currently underway withinour school of basic sciences and clinical sciences that deal with var-ious aspects of complementary medicine. Now we want to do moreof this, and, as I listen to the Ornish that is described, I have agreat deal of difficulty in accepting this as an alternative medicine.I think this is mainstream medicine that is currently underfundedand under-recognized. As the evidence accrues, we need to learn how to integrate that into the practice of medicine. We try to teach that to our students.By the way, one out of every five physicians in on active duty todayis a graduate of your Uniformed Services University. So we are agrowing enterprise, and we are part of the academic health centerof the military health system. I am very pleased that the first Director of the Office of Alter- native Medicine, Dr. Wayne Jonus, is now a member of our facility.He is a lieutenant colonel, family medicine physician in our Depart-ment of Family Medicine. I was very pleased when Mr. Waxman VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May from his editorial in the November 11th Journal of the American Medical Association. I have a full statement that is included in the written report to you, and I stand by to answer any questions you might have. [The prepared statement of Drs. Mazzuchi and Thank you. We will get back to questions in just a moment. Dr. Holohan.Dr. H OLOHAN . Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am glad to be sitting next to the president of USUHS, which has a superb faculty, I amtold, as well. First, permit me to note that Dr. Kizer, the Under Secretary for Health, yesterday sent letters to the committee Chair and rankingmember in which he emphasized some points that we made in ourwritten testimony, and complimented the committee for addressingthis topic. A conflict in his schedule prevents him from beingpresent to testify today. Public interest in alternative medical practices is increasing, and there are likely many reasons for this, including dissatisfactionwith limitations of conventional medicine, desire for treatment di-rected toward the whole person, distrust of drugs and side effects,and some understandable frustration in search for a cure on thepart of patients afflicted with chronic or serious disorders. Conventional medicine 's interest is evidenced by the fact that an entire recent issue of the Journal of the American Medical Associa-tion was devoted to this topic. Of note, VA participated in one ofthe trials that was reported in that issue. Alternative medicine is a very nonspecific term that has been used to describe a heterogeneous group of practices. While their un-derlying philosophies and the manner in which their agents andtechniques are employed diverge from mainstream medical prin-ciples and practices, that separation is not distinct and absolute, aswe shall later discuss and as has been mentioned several times byprevious witnesses. VA recently awarded a contract to evaluate alternative practices as they might apply to our system of healthcare in VA. At present,that report hasn 't been completed, but we do, however, have some preliminary survey data regarding the state of alternative practicesin VA facilities. While knowledge and even awareness of alternative practices varied widely among providers and facilities, most of the 131 facili-ties surveyed provide some such treatments. These practices usu-ally reflected the presence of a practitioner or practitioner advo-cates and managerial willingness to accept the implementation ofthose programs. Most of the facility management teams were re-ported as pragmatically oriented and described as having no biasesfor or against alternative treatments. The main concerns VA personnel expressed related to the highly variable training and credentialing of practitioners, the lack ofsound scientific evidence supporting the use of many alternativetherapies, and uneasiness about the budgetary impact of alter-native practice in an environment of constrained resources. We note that many practices often considered as alternative have been or are also used by conventional medicine. For example, phys-ical and manual treatment significantly overlap with modalitiesthat are widely used in the current practice of physical medicineand rehabilitation. Many nutritional therapy models have counter-parts in allopathic medicine, such as the use of hyperalimentationas an adjunct to conventional cancer treatment. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 literature contains numerous studies of vitamin supplementation, the use of zinc and antioxidants, amongmany others. Many drugs that are used by conventional practi-tioners are, in fact, botanical preparations which have been evalu-ated in clinical trials and approved for marketing by FDA. Theseinclude vincristine from the periwinkle plant, digitalis fromfoxglove, and taxol, which was originally extracted from the Pacificyew tree bark. Moreover, mind/body interaction is not a phenomenon that is only recognized by alternative practitioners, as there is, in fact, along history in medicine of appreciation of those mutual effects. Asignificant body of mainstream research has provided data that in-dicate the prognosis for coronary disease patients with depressionis worse than for those without; that breast cancer patients who at-tended a support group had measurably better outcomes than thosewho did not, and that single male cancer patients had poorer prog-noses than married patients. Many similar findings are published, and currently, in VA we are developing a formal systemwide strategy to fully integrate mentalhealth and medical services throughout our system of care, basedupon our belief that all diseases or disorders exist within an indi-vidual who is the unit of the care. At the same time, one cannot ignore alternative or unconven- tional care that may be extreme. There are a number of therapieswhose advocates have proposed unreasonably optimistic claims andwhose treatments have been ineffective and often harmful. Ourwritten testimony provided specific examples of a number of suchregimens. Indeed, in the early 1980 's, a committee chaired by the late Con- gressman Claude Pepper published a comprehensive, sobering, yetremarkable, report on the wide variety of ineffective treatmentsbeing sold to the public. We do not mean by imply that all uncon-ventional treatments are ipso facto suspect. The critical point to bemade is that the advocate of any treatment, conventional or uncon-ventional, allopathic or homeopathic, surgical or psychological, hasan ethical and moral obligation to provide high-quality evidencethat satisfactorily demonstrates the treatment is effective, and thatthe benefit is clearly proportionate to the risk. This is true for con-ventional treatment, and it is true for alternative practices. Claims that assert that scientific research standards are inappro- priate or irrelevant to alternative practices are wrong. Science isnot a belief system, but merely a disciplined method of investiga-tion that enables one to test the hypothesis, and its applicabilityis virtually universal, we feel. The scientific method is the only instrument that permits a mathematically sound statement of the probability that a par-ticular cause will result in a specific effect. A casual and anunsystemic linkage of cause and effect is too often erroneous, andfor those reasons, prudent clinicians are loathe to accept anecdotalevidence, a few cases, or subjective judgments as proof of efficacy. VA believes we have a serious responsibility to demand evidence of benefit and safety for treatments we provide to veteran patients,and we have invested considerable resources to that end. We alsobelieve that opinion or beliefs do not constitute scientific evidence VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May anecdotes or small series studies represent the weakest forms of evidence and only serve to provide a hypothesis that canbe tested in a well-designed trial. While such positions are not in accord with the opinions of some in both the conventional and alternative medical fields, they areratified by how most of us, tacitly or overtly, rely on the scientificmethod in our daily lives. When we step into an airplane, we areaware of our dependence upon the research and experimentationunderlying the engineer 's theories and upon the repeated testing of materials and design of the airframe, engines, and controls. We ex-pect the Federal Aviation Administration to provide serious over-sight of aircraft manufacture, and that design and construction willrely in the application of scientific investigation. We also expectthat production will be accomplished by technical experts qualifiedby training and experience, and certified as competent by reliableand responsible authorities. It is dangerous to assume that so-called natural or nonpharma- ceutical products are by nature safe. In our written testimony, wenoted the recent recall of a dietary supplement, gamma butyro-lactone, or GBL, which has caused comas, seizures, cardiac andrespiratory arrest, and death. Undoubtedly, most consumers madeill or killed by GBL assumed its production and sale implied atleast some research demonstrating safety, if not effectiveness.Sadly, they were mistaken. At present, there is a paucity of rigorous, reliable, and valid clin- ical trial data supporting many alternative interventions. Indeed,that was identified as a major concern of VA personnel in our con-tractors ' survey. We believe that evidence is critical in our deter- mination as to the role alternative medicine may play in the careof our patients. To that end, our research and development pro-gram will continue to fund scientifically meritorious investigator-initiated research related to alternative practice at all levels. Inconsistent alternative provider credentialing, licensing, and regulation pose serious problems in the utilization of those practi-tioners and techniques. And, Mr. Chairman, you asked a questionabout this a minute ago of Dr. Berman. Acupuncturists are licensedin 35 States; massage therapists in 27; naturopaths in 4, and ho-meopaths in 14 States. I did some surfing of the internet on naturopathy and found an internet site that provided naturopathy information \u2014actually, two sites \u2014that made a statement that, ''Certified naturopaths may complete a 4-year program of study or they may be someone withnothing more than a diploma from a diploma mill or a correspond-ence school. '' VA has set high standards for practitioner education, credentialing, and certification. All newly hired VA physiciansmust be licensed and board-certified. Advanced practice nursesmust possess licensure, national certification, and a graduate de-gree; and registered nurses, licensure and a bachelor 's degree. We believe that all providers in VA should meet appropriate com-parable standards, irrespective of their practice focus. In closing, VA is investigating alternative medicine practices and is presently gathering data to address the interest of our cliniciansand the extent of alternative medicine use in our system. We ex- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May reviewing information developed from the literature base for alternative practices, the appropriateness of employment for ourpopulation, and information on cost and cost-effectiveness. VA expects that any treatment offered to veteran patients, whether conventional or alternative, and provided outside the con-text of a clinical trial, will be chosen on the basis of objective evi-dence sufficient to permit the conclusion that it is both safe and ef-fective. Thank you.[The prepared statement of Dr. Dr. Holohan. Dr. Kamerow, why is it that, if there is a program like Dr. Ornish 's that has substantial evidence that shows that it is effec- tive in reducing conventional therapies, such as open heart surgeryand\u2014what is the balloon thing again \u2014angioplasty, why is it that there is not some mechanism for the Department of Health andHuman Services to contact Congress and suggest to us that wetake legislative action that will enable you to put that under theMedicare program? I guess the point I am trying to make is this: We are finding out today that most of the people here agree that that program hasmerit, is effective, and is going to save a lot of money in the areaof reduced heart surgeries and angioplasties. If that is the case, weare finding out about it, and we are going to be getting togetherwith you and others at the Department of HHS, along with the doc-tor, to figure out some way to provide the passage of legislation,so that you can put that into the Medicare program. My question is, why is it, when something like this happens, do you have to wait for Congress to come to you and take the initia-tive? Wouldn 't it be better, if you know that there is something that works, for you to tell people in Congress about it, so that wecould start the wheels rolling that will enable you to incorporateit into your procedures? Dr. K AMEROW . I think that is a good idea, Mr. Chairman. I will certainly check with the Health Care Financing Administrationand suggest that to them. I think that in this particular case it is only really recently \u2014and I mean quite recently, such as the last several months \u2014that there have been good randomized control studies in fairly large popu-lations of the kinds of interventions that Dr. Ornish is talkingabout. It is a very intensive regimen \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . I understand. Dr. K AMEROW [continuing]. And it has been done successfully in small numbers of people. My understanding is that the people atHCFA are looking at it closely and would be glad to talk to youabout it. Mr. B URTON . I understand it takes a lot of discipline. I wish you would suggest to them \u2014I know that the agencies are not supposed to lobby Members of Congress. However, I can tellyou, as one Member of Congress and chairman of one committee,that I would not consider it lobbying if, for instance, the Depart-ment of HHS came to us and said, ''Here is a procedure that will help people, reduce medical costs, and one that we could use in theMedicare program with great efficiency and effectiveness, if Con-gress would allow us to do it, but right now we are prohibited fromdoing it because there is a legislative prohibition against it. '' Dr. K AMEROW . I will be glad to take that message \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . And, really, I don 't think anybody would consider that lobbying \u2014it is that you gave us some ideas or suggestions \u2014 and I certainly wouldn 't. I wish you would tell them that over there, because there may be other things that we don 't know about besides this program that might be very advantageous to the Medi-care program, to HHS, and to the populace in general. Dr. K AMEROW . I would he happy to do that. VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May Let me ask you just a couple more questions. I know that you are pinch-hitting for the Secretary, since there is noone on her staff that covers alternative medicine. Do you think thatit would be helpful for HHS to have an Associate Secretary forComplementary or Alternative Medicine? Dr. K AMEROW . I think that the Department is working to coordi- nate these issues at multiple levels, and that they would be gladto consider those kinds of suggestions from you. As I said in thetestimony, there certainly are a number of activities going onthroughout the Department and a number of agencies. I think theyare working together to try to coordinate them. The Director ofNIH, Dr. Varmus, does have a committee that he convenes acrossthe Public Health Service, with representatives from the differentagencies, to talk about research in complementary and alternativemedicine. So I think there are some mechanisms that are in placenow to coordinate the different activities. Mr. B URTON . I guess the question I am posing is \u2014I am not talk- ing about a person who is an advocate for alternative therapy, butsomeone who would constantly peruse the medical journals andcheck to see if there are new alternative ways that are coming on-line that have been proven effective that they could point out to thepeople who are in charge of HHS, who will be making decisions onwhether or not to move into different areas or new areas thatmight help the population. So you might throw that out to them, as well as some idea on how to keep Congress informed, as well as the upper echelons ofHHS, on new therapies that may be coming along of an alternativenature. Dr. K AMEROW . I would be happy to do that. Mr. B URTON . In 1997, the NIH consensus panel, their consensus was that acupuncture was effective in the treatment of post-opera-tive and chemotherapy nausea. Why is it that they are still not al-lowing acupuncture to be utilized through the Medicare program? Dr. K AMEROW . My understanding about acupuncture and Medi- care is that there is a national noncoverage statement and policy,and that, in light of the recent Consensus Conference and otherevidence, that they are looking at this, and when they feel that theevidence is strong enough, that they will change that. It is important to point out that evidence from one source, such as an NIH Consensus Conference, may not be all that is necessary.It may be the opinion of some experts, and HCFA often requiresthat there be the kinds of randomized control trials that Dr. Ornishtalked about before they will cover interventions. But that is onekind of evidence, and they certainly are taking that under consider-ation. Mr. B URTON . Well, I have some personal experience. My wife had chemotherapy. My mother and father, who both died last Sep-tember and October, had chemotherapy. And I know the kinds ofproblems that you have when you take that after a period of time.You regurgitate. You have all kinds of complications. It just seemsto me if acupuncture has been helpful \u2014even though they took medication, they still had these kinds of problems. If acupuncturerelieves those kinds of symptoms, and it has been proven to do so,as we believe it has, it seems to me that that ought to be some- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 considered. You might want to put some lim- itations on acupuncture until other things are proven, but if it ishelping in those areas, I wish that you would at least talk to themabout that and look into that. Dr. K AMEROW . I certainly will. Mr. B URTON . How much money has VA invested in alternative medicine research? Dr. H OLOHAN . I will pass that question over to our representative from the Office of Research, Dr. Burris. Mr. B URTON . Doctor, why don 't you come over to the microphone, so that I can hear you? Do you know how much they have spent?Dr. B URRIS . In fiscal year 1998, there were over 100 individual research products in the area of complementary and alternativemedicine being conducted in VA facilities. They were funded at ap-proximately $5.5 million by VA, and an additional over $9 millionfrom all other sources of funding combined, other Federal agenciesas well as nonprofit organizations. Mr. B URTON . So the total for VA as well as other Federal agen- cies was about $14, $15 million? Dr. B URRIS . In fiscal year 1998, that is correct. Mr. B URTON . What percentage of that would be the total expendi- ture for conventional healthcare therapies? Dr. B URRIS . It would be a little less than 2 percent of the VA re- search budget for that fiscal year. Mr. B URTON . As well as the other agencies you were talking about? Dr. B URRIS . No, I don 't know what the figure would be of the other agencies. Mr. B URTON . OK. But it is about 2 percent? Dr. B URRIS . Of the VA budget. Mr. B URTON . In the area of cancer research, didn 't you say that it was about 1 percent, that we are putting $2.3 billion into conven-tional cancer research and about $20 million into alternative thera-pies? So we are looking at somewhere between 1 and 2 percent foralternative therapies. Is there any suggestion that VA or the Department of Defense or at HHS that we increase that percentage? Because some of thesealternatives have been very, very effective. Dr. Mazzuchi? Mr. M AZZUCHI . Well, there is a way of doing that, I think, with- out necessarily increasing the percentage. I wish I had better datafor you, and I can get it for you. As part of the DOD 's breast cancer research program, where the Congress has appropriated consider-able amount of money to the Department for breast cancer re-search, some of those moneys are set aside for IDEA grants. I haveforgotten what the IDEA acronym stands for, but, basically, it isresearch moneys given to researchers who do not have a proventrack record in the business; they have not been in the business ofcancer research, or who are looking at alternative therapies or newtechniques. It is basically meant to stimulate research in areasfrom people who have not been in this area before and with ideasthat are different from some of the more mainstream researchideas. I think that is a good way to go with alternative medical re-search, is that you open the door, not necessarily setting out a cer- VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 certainly encourage, as part of your over- all grant, that some areas would be in places that were not \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . See, the concern I have is that to encourage is kind of a nebulous thing. If there are specific funds that are allocatedfor a project or an area, that money is going to be used for thatspecific area. If you do it any other way, then the money, in allprobability, won 't get to that. Mr. M AZZUCHI . Our IDEA grants actually are a certain amount of money that is set aside. It is not really percentage, but I guessyou could make it a percentage of the money. Mr. B URTON . OK, what amount of money is set aside for that? Mr. M AZZUCHI . I have to get the number for you. It is quite large. It is about a quarter of the research grants are done with IDEAgrants. Now all the IDEA grants aren 't alternative medicine. They are simply with people who have not done this kind of research inthe main or are trying to attract both new scientists and newmethodologies, which some of that would go into. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Well, we know that in the area of HHS and cancer it was about 1 percent, and we know now that at VA it is about2 percent. So that is a very, very small percentage of the overallspending. There is a growing sense in the country among peoplewho are veterans, at the VA, people in the Defense Department,and the general population that alternative therapies are some-thing that they really want to take a hard look at before they gowith conventional therapies. So it seems to me that there ought tobe more money spent in that area instead of just a mere pittance;1 or 2 percent is not going to cut it. Yes, sir?Dr. Z IMBLE . Mr. Burton, I just wanted to mention, I overlooked one fairly important fact, and that is that, in the 1999 appropria-tion to the Department of Defense, $2.5 million was appropriatedto our university to support the Ornish program. We will be bring-ing that to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, which will be doingsome work specifically for that. Mr. B URTON . So you are very supportive of that program? Dr. Z IMBLE . Oh, yes, sir. Mr. B URTON . What I would like for you to do, if you would, for me\u2014because we are going to be meeting with the people at the HHS about that program, and we are going to have Dr. Ornishcome back from San Francisco to meet with us, to try to figure outsome way to legislatively get that program online, so we can incor-porate it into the Medicare program. If you are sympathetic towardthat end with the VA and the Department of Defense, if you couldsend me a letter to that effect, I would sure like to have that, justsaying that you think it has worked; it has been effective. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 Let me ask you one more question regarding the veterans. Is saw palmetto available to veterans? We understandthat that has had a positive impact on prostate problems. Dr. H OLOHAN . Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I don 't know. Mr. B URTON . Well, could somebody maybe check into that and let me know? Because that is one thing that there is some evidencethat has been helpful in a number of prostate problems in men. [The information referred to follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 You mentioned that the Defense Department will begin integrating alternative therapies when they have been testedand shown to be safe and cost-effective. Since acupuncture hasbeen shown by an NIH consensus panel to be effective for post-op-erative and chemotherapy nausea, as well as dental pain, whenwill the Defense Department begin making acupuncture in certaincases available systemwide? Mr. M AZZUCHI . We have begun the process to do that. Based on the Consensus Conference at NIH, we communicated that informa-tion to the office in Aurora, which is the benefits office, which tendsto look at new technologies and does technology assessment withus. That office is looking at the literature right now, and is lookingat perhaps doing some clinical trials to determine whether thisshould be a covered benefit. It is a process that takes between 1and 2 years. We are about 8 or 9 months into that process now.My expectation is that, based on the literature we have seen so far,it looks fairly favorable that at least in some circumstances itwould be covered. Now, as I have said, we do cover it inside theMTFs, our medical treatment facilities, like Walter Reed, and soforth. But in terms of being paid for, if you receive your care exter-nal to our military hospitals, that we still do not do, but that iswhere we are heading. Mr. B URTON . Let me just make one more comment, and then we will let you folks go. I am sorry you had to wait all day. I reallyappreciate your patience. One of the things that I believe Dr. Ornish mentioned was that they had a very difficult time \u2014I think it was Dr. Ornish \u2014they had a very difficult time getting the funds to get the body of evidencethat was necessary to show that the program was effective. He saidhe had to go to private foundations to get the money, which wasvery difficult. He could not get any from the Federal Government,even though we now know, in retrospect, that the program doeswork and it does have real benefits. Are any of the funds that you are allocated being used to look into these alternative therapies, so that people like Dr. Ornish canget the results that you require, so that they can be incorporatedinto your programs? Do you see what I am saying? I mean, if avery small percentage is dedicated for alternative therapy research,and somebody like Dr. Ornish comes up with a new procedure thatis going to be very effective and save money and help save lives,and everything else, how can we allocate more of our resources sothat they can get that kind of testing result finalized, so that youcan have it for your review, and, ultimately, for getting the proce-dure into your practices and your policies? Did I make myselfclear? Maybe I didn 't. Dr. Z IMBLE . At the Uniformed Services University, we work with a statutorily created 501(3)(c) foundation, the Henry M. JacksonFoundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine. Mr. B URTON . Who puts the money into that? Is that a govern- ment funded \u2014\u2014 Dr. Z IMBLE . That can come through government. It comes from both the private sector and can come from the government. The$2.5 million I mentioned to you previously will go from me to thefoundation. The foundation will give some of that to the Walter VerDate 11-MAY-2000 08:40 May Center. Some of that will go to Dr. Ornish for his preventive medicine research. Mr. B URTON . I am not just talking about Dr. Ornish. I am talk- ing about the other \u2014\u2014 Dr. Z IMBLE . Right, but we can use that \u2014that paradigm can be used for other methodologies. Mr. B URTON . OK. So the Department of Defense, even though the funds are not high \u2014\u2014 Dr. Z IMBLE . Right. Mr. B URTON [continuing]. It is a very small amount \u2014you do have a way of doing that. How about NIH and HHS? Dr. K AMEROW . HHS has a number of mechanisms for either new investigators or small grants for novel ideas, sometimes more off-the-wall ideas, that they can use. I know that AHCPR, we have asmall grants program for just those kinds of pilot programs or earlyresearch, where people can apply if they don 't have the credentials that Dr. Ornish was talking about before to get funding for thesekinds of projects. Mr. B URTON . How do they make the judgment on who gets those grants? Dr. K AMEROW . They are reviewed in study sections, which is typ- ical. Mr. B URTON . By whom? Dr. K . By peers. Peer review. Mr. B URTON . Peer review, doctors. Are any of those doctors on any boards of any pharmaceutical companies, or have they everbeen employees of any pharmaceutical companies? Dr. K AMEROW . I believe that is a pretty \u2014\u2014 Mr. B URTON . Broad question? Dr. K AMEROW [continuing]. Pretty broad question. I am sure somewhere there is, but they are generally university and other re-searchers. Mr. B URTON . Well, I think you know why I asked that question. There is a concern that, if an alternative therapy or alternative vi-tamin or drug, or whatever it might be, comes on the market, thatthere might be some impediments to them getting that approvedor even getting a grant to have it tested thoroughly because of in-fluence being exerted by people who have a vested interest. Dr. K AMEROW . I think that this is an important point that you have made a couple of times during the hearing, and my responsewould be that I think it is through the government research wherethis kind of nonprofitable, if you will, research gets a chance, be-cause the R&D that gets paid for by the drug companies won 't pay for this kind of work. So really it is very important for us in thepublic sector to fund this research in the most impartial way pos-sible. Mr. B URTON . Toward that end, if we can be of any help at all, and if you think that there is any way, any of your agencies, thatwe could be of help, I wish you would let me know. Dr. Kamerow, I look forward to talking with you further about HHS and Dr. Ornish 's program and some legislation that we might be able to put together, together, that might get that thing into theoverall Medicare program. Dr. K AMEROW . Yes, sir. VerDate Well, thank you very much for being here. I really appreciate it. Thank you very much.We stand adjourned.[Whereupon, at 3:16 p.m., the committee was adjourned.][Additional information submitted for the hearing record follows:] VerDate 11-MAY-2000 "}
