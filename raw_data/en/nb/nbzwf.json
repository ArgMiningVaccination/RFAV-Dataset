The practice is said to date back over 2,000 years and was first used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) as a way to treat a range of health problems.

The [therapist](https://mantracare.org/therapy/therapist/therapist/) will lubricate your skin with oil and then press the instrument against your muscles in a scraping motion. The therapist may also use their fingers or knuckles in a similar fashion. During the session, it is usually combined with other techniques such as cupping and massage. Muscle scraping is said to break up adhesions in the muscles and improve blood circulation. The therapist may also scrape along your tendons and ligaments.
