The center is located in the Southern High Plains and is centrally located in the largest crop area in New Mexico. The center is comprised of 156 acres of land, which has an ap proximate 0.8% slope to the southeast. The center is located at 34.60o N, -103.22o W, at an elevation of 4,435 feet above sea level. The Olton clay loam soil at the center is representative of a vast area of the High Plains of New Mexico and the Texas Panh andle. Research at the center began in 1948, originally as dryland field research. Irrigation studies were initiated in 1960, when an irrigation well was developed. Water for irrigation is derived from the Ogallala Aquifer. Since 2005, the center has impro ved its irrigation delivery by developing two center pivot irrigation systems and subsurface and surface drip irrigation systems. Center Events and Activities Advisory Committee Meeting: The Clovis Agricultural Science Center Advisory Committee met on April 28, 2017 at the Center Conference Room. After a sponsored lunch, Dean Rolando Flores gave an update on the University and the recent legislative session. Abdel Mesbah, Superintendent gave an update on the Center and ongoing research. After the update s, Dean Flores had a listening session with only the Advisory Committee Members. \"Cultivating Young Minds \" is an annual event targeting 5th grade student from Clovis Elementary Schools. The students will have a chance to visit the Center and learn about plants and plant parts. At the end of their visit, students will have a chance to go to the center's pumpkin field and pick a pumpkin or two to take home. In 2017, ten schools participated with a total of 610 students.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted at the Agricultural Science Center, Clovis NM. The study had a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement of eight treatments and three replications. Two phases of WW -SF rotation were present at each year. The first phase of the rotation starts by planting winter wheat in October, which is harvested in July of the following year. The second phase of the crop rotation starts by planting cover crops (CCs) in a fallow field in February, which is terminated in May followed by planting winter wheat in the October. The CC treatments included a fallow (no cover crop), three sole CCs (pea, oat, canola), and four CC mixtures [pea + oat (PO), pea + canola (PC), pea + oat + canola (POC), and six species mixtures (SSM) of pea + oat + canola + hairy vetch + forage radish + barl ey]. Winter wheat variety TM113 was planted using a plot drill (Great Plains 3P600, Moline, IL) at a seeding rate of 55 lbs/ac. Wheat was planted in a field of sorghum stubble on October 2015 and in a CC residue on October 2016. All the treatments received 60 l bs/ac and 62 lbs/ac nitrogen in 2016 and 2017, respectively and 11 lbs/ac Sulphur each year. Each plot received 10\" and 12\" irrigation water in 2016 and 2017, respectively, at critical growth stages of wheat: crown root initiation/tillering, jointing, head ing, flowering and grain filling stage. Soil samples were collected seasonally from top 6 inches, homogenized, composited, and brought to the laboratory for analysis. Laboratory analysis for included inorganic nitrogen, mineralizable nitrogen (PMN), micro bial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and total nitrogen. Available N was analyzed as a sum of KCl extractable NO 3- and NH 4+ in an automated flow injection N Analyzer (Timberline Instruments, LLC). Soil PMN was analyzed in an automated flow injection N Analyzer as described for available N after 14 -days of aerobic incubation . Soil total N was analyzed in a LECO CNS analyzer (Ellington and Associates, Inc). All data were analyzed by using a mixed procedure in SAS (SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. 2013) for a rando mized complete block experiments . All statistical analyses were performed at significant probability (p) <0.05. RESULTS There was no significant year \u00d7 CC treatments interaction effects on available N analyzed between 2016 and 2017 in response to CC treatments in a CC -WW phase however, there was significant effect of the CC treatments (Figure 1). Available N was 69% to 203% greater in Fallow than all 20 CCs while no significant difference was observed between CCs. The analysis of available N at different sampling dates following the CC planting showed significant effect of the CC treatments \u00d7 sampling date interaction (Figure 2 ). At May 2016, fallow had 69% to 91% greater available N than all the CCs while there was no significant difference between the CCs (Figure 2). The PO had 57% more available N than PC while other CCs including fallow were not significantly different from both PO and PC in October 2016. Available N was consistently reduced in February 2017 and July 2017 across all treatments compared to respective treatments at WW planting time. Fallow had 58%, 79% and 48% greater available N than pea, PC and POC respectiv ely while oat, canola, PO and SSM were not significantly different from fallow, pea, PC and POC at jointing stage of WW in February 2017. The PO and oat had 52% and 48% more available N, respectively than PC while other CCs and fallow were not significantl y different at wheat harvesting in July 2017. There was a significant difference between treatments, but no significant difference between sampling dates and the CC treatments \u00d7 sampling date interaction in PMN. Averaged across the sampling dates, fallow had 22%, 31%, 35% and 42% more PMN than POC, pea, SSM and PC respectively, but it was not significantly different from oat, canola and PO (Figure 3). Similarly, PC had the least PMN value but it was not significantly different from pea, canola, POC and SSM . There were no significant effects of CC treatments on MBN. MBN values ranged from 31 -38 kg ha-1. There was significant effect of the CC treatments on soil total N. It was significantly greater in oat than PC, pea, POC and SSM but it was not significantly difference than fallow and PO (Figure 4). Figure 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted at the Agricultural Science Center, Clovis NM. The study had a randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement of eight treatments and three replications. Two phases of WW -SF rota tion were present at each year. The first phase of the rotation (WW -CC hereafter) starts by planting winter wheat in October, which is harvested in July of the following year. The second phase of the crop rotation (CC -WW hereafter) starts by planting CCs i n a fallow field in February, which is terminated in May followed by planting winter wheat in the October. The cover crop (CC) treatments included a fallow (no cover crop), three sole CCs [pea, oat and canola, and four CC mixtures; pea + oat (PO), pea + ca nola (PC), pea + oat + canola (POC), and six species mixtures (SSM) of pea + oat + canola + hairy vetch + forage radish + barley]. Winter wheat variety TM113 was planted using a plot drill (Great Plains 3P600, Moline, IL) at a seeding rate of 55 lbs/ac. W heat was planted in a field of sorghum stubble on October 2015 and in a CC residue on October 2016. All the treatments received 60 lbs/ac and 62 lbs/ac nitrogen in 2016 and 2017, respectively and 11 lbs/ac Sulphur each year. Each plot received 10\" and 12\" irrigation water in 2016 and 2017, respectively, at critical growth stages of wheat: crown root initiation/tillering, jointing, heading, flowering and grain filling stage. Soil samples were collected seasonally from top 6 inches depth, homogenized, composited, and brought to the laboratory for analysis. Laboratory analysis included potentially mineralizable carbon (PMC), Potassium permanganate oxidzable carbon (POXC) and tota l soil organic carbon (SOC). All the data were analyzed by using a mixed procedure in SAS (SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. 2013) for a randomized complete block experiments . All statistical analyses were performed at significant probability (p) <0.05. RESULTS Soil PMC was 20% greater in 2016 than 2017. When averaged across two years, Canola had 25%, 30%, 52% and 83% greater PMC than PO, pea, POC and fallow respectively while oat, PC and SSM were not significantly different from canola (Figure 1). Fallo w had the least PMC content. Comparison of PMC between treatments over different sampling dates after CC termination revealed no significant CC treatments \u00d7 sampling date interactions. The PMC content was reduced 24 by 108% and 27% at wheat planting and joint ing stage respectively than at CC termination. However, it was 50% greater at wheat harvesting than at CC termination. Similarly, the SSM had 13%, 19% and 27% greater POXC than fallow, PC and canola respectively while it was not significantly different fr om pea, oat, PO and POC in 2016. However, POXC was not significantly different between CC treatments in 2017. In CC -WW phase, there were no significant CC treatment \u00d7 sampling date interactions but CC treatments and sampling date had significant effects on POXC (Figure 2). When averaged across sampling dates, oat had significantly greater POXC (4% to 20%) than all CC treatments including fallow. The PO was not significantly different from fallow and SSM while canola was not significantly different from PC with least value of POXC than all CC treatments. POC was not significantly different from pea but was significantly lower than PO, fallow and SSM. POXC was 7% to 10% greater at CC termination than other sampling dates while it was the least at wheat harvest ing. POXC was not significantly different at wheat planting and jointing stage of wheat. There were significant effects of CC treatments on total SOC at wheat harvesting (Figure 3). Oat had significantly greater total SOC than pea, canola, PC and SSM while the lowest total SOC was observed in PC which was not significantly different from pea and canola. Implications of the study The results from soil properties at CC termination in both WW -CC and CC -WW phase showed that CCs can improve SOC pools. In particular, oat decomposed slowly, gradually recycled soil nutrients, and contributed to SOM accumulation, while pea and canola resid ue favored early mineralization and rapidly recycled the soil nutrients. 25 Figure 1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Study site and treatments The study was conducted at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Clovis, NM ( 34\u00b035' N, 103\u00b012' W, 1,348 m elevation). The cover crop (CC) study was established in 18 m x 12 m plots in a randomized complete block design with eight treatments and three replications per treatment nested within each crop rotation phase. The crop phases were arranged as a main plot and CC treatments were arranged as a split plot. The CC treatments included fallow (no cover crop), three sole CCs (pea, oat, canola), and four CC mixtures [pea + oat (PO), pea + canola (PC), pea + oat + canola (POC), and six species mixtures (SSM) of pea + oat + can ola + hairy vetch + forage radish + barley]. The CC study had two phases of the rotation. In the first phase of the study, wheat was planted in October 2015 and harvested in July 2016, followed by planting CCs in February 2017 which were terminated in May 2017. In the second phase of the experiment, CCs were planted in a fallow field in February 2016 and terminated in May 2016, followed by planting winter wheat in October 2016, and harvesting in July 2017. Cover crop and weed biomass sampling The CC above ground biomass and weed biomass samples were collected from 1.2 sq. yards, one day prior to CC termination on May 21, 2016 and May 24, 2017. Three replicated samples were collected from each CC treatment, fresh weight was taken and all the samples were oven dried at 130oF for 72 hours to estimate dr y matter yield. Weeds from each treatment were identified and counted to determine the weed density. Weed suppression potential of CCs was determined and interpreted based on cover crop weed index, defined as the ratio of dry mass of CC and dry mass of wee d. Wheat yield estimation Wheat yield in the CC study was estimated by harvesting 4 ft x 10 ft area with a Sickle Bar Mower (Santa Fe Equipment Sales Inc, Santa Fe, NM) at maturity (~14% moisture). Wheat was harvested on June 24, 2016 and July 13, 2017. Wheat aboveground biomass (straw and grain) was collected in bags, brought to the laboratory and thrashed using a plot combine thresher to estimate grain yield and harvest index. The moisture content of wheat grain was determined with a moisture meter while straw was over dried at oven dried at 130oF for 72 hours to estimate moisture content and dry matter yield. Wheat grain yield, harvest index (HI) and 1000 grain weight were then calculated at 14% moisture. 28 Statistical Analysis All the data were analyzed by using a mixed procedure in SAS (SAS version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. 2013) for a randomized complete block experiments . RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS Cover crop and weed biomass The CC biomass production was significantly different between CC treatments and years, while there were no significant interactions between the treatments; therefore, CC treatment means were averaged across years, and year means were averaged across all CC treatments (Table 1). Among CC treatments, oat and treatment combinations with oat produced greater biomass than pea, canola and their mixtures, while SSM was intermediate between these treatments. Oat dry biomass was 142%, 132%, 73% and 19% greater than pea, canola, PC, and SSM respectively. These results were comparable with the observations of an average yield of 4164 lbs/ac in Lubbock Texas with a seeding rate of 90 lbs/ac and full irrigation. Pea, canola, and PC produced the lowest biomass compared to other treatments in our study because of the frost kill and poor stand establishment. Weeds present in CC plots included kochia, marestail, redroot pigweed and Russian thistle, with kochia being the dominant weed species comprising two thirds of total col lected weed biomass in both years. Weed dry biomass in 2016 was significantly greater in canola (616%) than fallow, while other CC treatments were not significantly different from fallow. Weed dry biomass in 2017 was 650%, 610%, 540%, 502% and 413% greater in pea, canola, PC and SSM respectively than in fallow, while POC was significantly greater than fallow but intermediate between CC treatments. Weed dry mass was consistently low with Oat that produced greater biomass in both years, while pea and canola w ith lower biomass performed poorly in reducing weed biomass (Table 1). The cover crop weed index was also greater in oat than other CC treatments except PO, and provided outstanding weed control. Wheat yield The average wheat grain yield before CC plantin g in 2016 was 2986 lbs/ac, while HI was 0.27. There were no significant effects of CC treatments on wheat yield and HI in 2017 (Table 2). However, the average wheat yield following CCs in our study was 5660 lbs/ac in 2017, which was 17 % greater than the a verage irrigated wheat yield in variety trials in at the Agricultural Science Center Clovis. Oat produced greater biomass, provided greater surface residue cover and excellent weed suppression compared to other treatments. Oat residue, characterized by gre ater C:N ratio might have slowed the decomposition and provided soil cover for longer period of time; thus, improving soil moisture retention, although we did not see significant CC treatments effect. Similarly, pea had greater lignin content which may hav e delayed mineralization and sustained nutrient cycling. We observed greater biomass production with oat in the CC mixture; therefore, the efficacy of CC mixtures can be improved by increasing proportion of oat, thereby providing better ground cover, susta ining nutrient cycling and improving wheat yield quality and quantity. Implications of the study The results of this study showed that CCs can suppress weeds and thereby support crop production. In particular, oat or CC mixture with oat was efficient in co ntrolling weeds. While pea and canola residue favored by providing soil nutrients, and other benefits having oat in the mixture can suppressed weeds and mixture was cover crops (SSM) produced the highest yield. 29 Table 1.

Thapa Agricultural Science Center, Clovis, NM INTRODUCTION The typical cropping system in the Eastern New Mexico involves intensive tillage and produces one crop in two years or two crops in three years, leaving the land fallow for a long time, to conserve soil moisture and restore soil fertility. However, fallowing has contributed to increasing water and wind erosion and loss of soil fertility and crop yields. Studies have shown that about 20 to 40 % of s oil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen storage have been lost due to cultivation in the last 100 years. By the mid -1960s, many farmers in the central and southern Great Plains region started using fertilizers, herbicides, and improved crop varieties. These changes increased crop production at the expense of further deterioration in soil fertility and productivity. Reduced tillage and alternative cropping practices have been shown in last several decades to overcome soil fertility challenges associated with d ryland cropping systems which rely on intensive tillage and fallowing. The alternative cropping practices involve reducing soil disturbances, reducing the fallow period, and maintaining soil cover with diverse residues. Diversifying the dryland cropping sy stems while reducing fallow period and soil disturbance can improve soil fertility and sustain crop production. The reduced tillage and cover cropping also help in soil conservation and soil fertility improvement by increasing soil aggregation and aggregat e stability, improving soil water infiltration and water retention, microbial activity, and buffering capacity. Residue accumulation in soil surface also affects N cycling. Leaving crop residues on the soil surface can increase total soil N compared to cle an tillage. The decay of crop residues in conservation tillage systems is delayed, resulting in slower release of residue N to the soil in comparison to the tilled systems. Less organic residue mixed into the soil with reduced tillage systems reduces the m icrobial energy supply resulting in depressed microbial activity, and thereby SOM mineralization and loss. Eventually, SOM content is enhanced along with its ability to conserve N. Thus, if yearly residue production is increased within a cropping system, a nd the tillage frequency is decreased, SOC levels may be maintained or increased with time, depending on the quantity and types of residue input into the soil. MATERIALS AND METHODS The study was conducted at the New Mexico State University, Agricultural S cience Center (ASC) Clovis, NM (34o35' N, 103o12' W, and 1,348 m elevation). The study area has a semi -arid climate with an average annual rainfall of 466 mm, about 70% of which occurs during May to September. Average annual maximum and minimum temperature s are 22.1oC and 4.28oC, respectively. The study area experiences high seasonal and inter -annual variability in precipitation with short -term drought periods often occurring within the growing season. The study was established in 2013 with NT and ST in a corn ( Zea mays ( Secale cereal L.) cover cropping treatments (cover cropping or no - cover cropping) were nested within each tillage system in 2016/17 and 2017/18. Both phases of the rotations (corn and sorghum) were present each year, and the treatments were replicated three 31 times. The total experimental area was seven acres in which two crops, two tillage systems, and two cover cropping treatments were designed as a randomized complete block experiment with split-split plot arrangement of treatments. The size of the individual plot was 80 ft. \u00d7 100 ft. Cover crop was planted in the first week of November 2016 at 20 lbs/ac rate and terminated in the third week of April 2017. The main crops (corn and sorghum) were planted in the last week of May 2017 using a no -till drill (John Deere, Moline IL) in NT and strip planter (Twin Diamond Industries, LLC, Minden NE) in ST plots. Corn and sorghum were planted at 13,000 seeds and 28,000 seeds per acre rate. Row spacing was maintained at 30 inches for both crops. All corn and sorghum plots were fertilized with 20 lbs/ac nitrogen and 3.5 lbs/ac sulfur at the time of planting, and no P and K fertilizers were applied. Soil samples were collected from 0 -6 inch depth of each plot using a soil core sampler in February, May, and October and analyzed for inorganic N, gravimetric water content, water stable aggregates (WSA), potassium permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), soil pH, and electrical conductivity (EC). Soil inorganic -N co ntent was determined by extracting 5 -g soil in 25 -ml 1-M KCl solution and measuring nitrate (NO 3-) and ammonium (NH 4+) ions in an automated flow injection N analyzer (Timberline Instruments, LLC). The PMC was estimated by aerobic incubation of 20 -g soil sa mples in 1 -L mason jars for two weeks (Ghimire et al. 2017) , and PMN was determined as inorganic -N on the incubated samples. Soil moisture content was determin ed by oven drying approximately 20 -g soil samples at 105oC for 24 -hr. The POXC was determined on 2.5 -g air dried samples mixed in 20 ml of 0.02 mol L-1 KMnO 4. The WSA were measured by using a Cornell Sprinkle Infiltrometer. Soil pH and EC were determined on a 1:5 soil to water suspension using pH electrodes and conductivity meters. Tillage and cover cropping effects on soil properties were analyzed using a GL M procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., 2013). Sources of variation in ANOVA included tillage, cover cropping, and their interactions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Soil inorganic N content was significantly different between tillage systems in May sampling for both crop rotation phases (Figure 1). No -cover cropping plots had 29.1 % and 7.9 % greater inorganic N content than cover cropping plots in corn and sorghum, respectively. However, soil inorganic N content was not significantly different between tillag e, cover crop, and tillage \u00d7 cover crop interaction in February and October sampling for both crop rotation phases. Soil EC content was significantly different between tillage treatments under sorghum, and no difference between tillage treatments was obse rved under corn in May sampling. EC was not significantly affected by cover cropping and tillage \u00d7 cover cropping interaction for both crop rotation phases. Other soil properties such as WSA, POXC, soil pH and soil moisture content were not significantly d ifferent between tillage and cover cropping treatments for either corn or sorghum rotation phases. The WSA were in the range of 88.3 % to 92.1 % and 85.5 % to 90.9 % in corn and sorghum rotation phases respectively. The POXC was in the range of 754 lbs/ac to 894 lbs/ac. The SMC varied at different sampling dates but did not differ between treatments within each sampling date. Soil pH was in the range of 6.4 - 6.8, and not different between treatments. 32 Fig.1 Tillage effects on inorganic nitrogen content u nder corn and sorghum. Implications of the study Greater inorganic N in ST than NT for both crop rotation phases can be attributed to the soil disturbances that took place in the strips of the ST treatments, because soil disturbance can increase the N mineralization from soil as well as crop residues. Gr eater inorganic N content observed for May sampling compared to February sampling, irrespective of tillage and cover crop treatments is as result of increased N mineralization as the soil warms up in the spring. ASC Clovis soils have high pH and contain hi gher amount of calcium carbonate. Low precipitation along with extensive dry periods causes evaporation of water and accumulation of salts on the soil surface. Soil disturbance under ST may have favored higher concentration of salts in the surface soil, as indicated by high EC, than under NT. There was no significant difference between tillage and cover cropping treatments within the rotations, and suggests that it may take several years to see the effects of tillage and cover cropping on these soil measure ments. The tillage systems have been in place only for four years and cover cropping was established for just one year. Long -term study is necessary for the realization of benefits of ST, NT and cover crops. This study shows that cover crop can increase N cycling and release for crop uptake. 0102030405060 Feb May OctSoil inorganic N (mg kg-1) Sampling datesCorn ST 0102030405060 Feb May Oct Sampling datesSorghum33 NuMex -02 - A High Oleic Valencia Peanut with Partial Resistance to Sclerotinia Blight and L.

Plots were sown as four rows, 4.0 m long by 3.0 m wide, and a spacing of 0.15 between plants to 0.75 m between rows. The design was a randomized complete block with 3 replications. No irrigation was applied complete rainfed crop. Seed were treated with captan (N -tricholoromethylthio - 4- cyclohexene -l,2dicarboximide) at the commercial rate of 2.5 g/kg of seed. 34 In Haiti field studies were conducted at Meds and Foods for Kids campus located in Quatier Morin, Cap Hatian Haitiin 2015 and 201 6. The experiment was a two factor split plot design replicated 3 times. Factor A was under a two spray fungicide regime (40DAP & 72 DAP) with untreated control for Factor B. Two row plots with a plot length of 3.1 m x 1.2 m wide. Seed rate used was Flori da 1-10 scale and Rust 1 -9 scale was used to identify levels of severity. Flavor tests were conducted by a private laboratory, J. Leeks and Associates, using 500 -g seed samples and a panel of human subjects trained in assessing peanut flavor. Statistica l Analysis Data for each variable were analyzed using PROC MIXED model in SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute). A LSD t text was used for mean separation involving entries (Steele and Torrie, 1989). Results and Discussion NuMex 02 is a high oleic Valencia ) cultivar, developed by the New Mexico Agricultural Experiment Station located at Clovis, New Mexico. NuMex 02 originated from a cross made between NM Valencia A and Olin. Pedigree selection was practice d based on oil quality as determined by high oleic (O)/linoleic (L) fatty acid ratio, pod size and shape, seeds per pod, seed size, testa color, market type (Valencia), maturity, yield and grade characteristics. The selected segregrants with these characte ristics were advance by single -seed descent method until F6. Phenotypically uniform progenies were bulk harvested to conduct yield trials in F7 and F8 generations. Performance tests in replicated trials across eastern New Mexico and west Texas began in 201 2 and continued until 2016. NuMex02 was tested under identity as NM308 -2. It matures in 128 days similar to Valencia A. Average across 15 tests, NuMex 02 produced 18% higher pod yield and showed to Sclerotinia blight (Sclerotinia sclerot iorum ). NuMex 02 showed potential for a yield advantage with 18% higher yields compared to Valencia A in eastern New Mexico and west Texas. NuMex 02 did not show any yield advantage compared to their locals checks in Haiti, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia but has a potential advantage compared to other types due to short growing season, sweet taste and in -shell market. NuMex 02 O/L ratio was 23:1 compared to 1:1 in Valencia A. Marker data revealed that NuMex 02 is partially resistant to Sclerotinia blight 35 Table 1.

Stock suspensions (ml) of each of the four selected fungicides was prepared according to the recommended field rate: Propulse, 0.99 L/ha; Fontelis, 1.75 L/ha; Endura, 0.70 Kg/ha. The recommended dilution rate of for Propulse Based on the recomme nded field rates, the area and volume doses for a Petri plate were calculated. A dose of 0.69 \u00b5l of Propulse in water and 0.49 \u00b5g Endura in 66 \u00b5l water were used to prepare fungicide suspe nsions which were then filtered through a 0.2 -\u00b5m microfilter. Sources and maintenance of S. sclerotiorum cultures . Sclerotia of S. sclerotiorum recovered from infected peanut and cabbage plants and stored at 5oC were used. To establish fresh cultures, a sclerotium from each isolate was placed separately on PDA in 9 -cm diameter Petri plates and incubated at room temperature (25 -27oC). After 2 days, mycelium growth was observed and 5 days after mycelium reached the edge of the Petri plate. These cultures we re used in all the experiments described below. The use of an isolate of S. sclerotiorum from cabbage in this study was used to ascertain the ability of this isolate to infect peanut, and to compare the response of both isolates to fungicides. In vitro growth of S. sclerotiorum (peanut and cabbage isolates) on fungicide -amended growth medium. Potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium was prepared based on standard procedures using 9 -cm diameter Petri plates, and then amended or not amended (control) with fungicides . To amend PDA, 25 ml of each fungicide suspension was spread on the surface of the medium, which was air dried under a laminar flow hood. Then, a 1 -cm mycelium plug from each of three days old isolate of S. sclerotiorum was separately placed at the cente r of the amended and non -amended PDA plates and the plates were incubated at a temperature range of 25 -27\u00b0C. Mycelium growth (measured from center of the mycelium plug) and pigmentation, and sclerotia production were recorded daily for a week. The experime nt was conducted four times (four trials) with each S. sclerotiorum isolate. Within each trial, there were five replications (a PDA plate served as an experiment unit) of each treatment (four fungicides and a control). 38 Oxalic acid production test on potat o dextrose -blue plates (PDABB): Thirty ppm of bromophenol blue was added to 500 ml of molten PDA media to make PDABB plates. The fungicide suspensions or sterile distilled water (control) were spread over the surface of PDABB plates as d escribed above. A 1 -cm mycelium plug from both isolates of S. sclerotiorum from peanut and cabbage were placed centrally on the amended and non -amended control PDABB plates. The plates were covered with aluminum foil and kept in the dark for 72 h. The pl ates were observed for the presence or absence of a yellow halo, which signifies oxalic acid production. In vitro growth of S. sclerotiorum isolates on fungicide -treated peanut leaflets. var was sown in a double sterilized 1:1 mixture of potting mix and sand in 9 cm \u00d7 6.5 cm pots and then placed in a growth chamber at 25\u00b0C. Leaflets were collected 20 days after sowing, and surface sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for one minute, wash ed with sterile distilled water, and then air dried. Each leaflet was then dipped in a fungicide suspension or water (control) and placed on a sterilized filter paper in a 9 -cm diameter Petri plate. The leaflets were incubated at a temperature of 27 -29\u00b0C at relative humidity of 95 -100%. The relative humidity was not measured but the dishes were sprayed with sterilized water and immediately Para filmed, so we assumed 95 -100% relative humidity conditions. The experiment was conducted twice (two trials) with each isolate of S. sclerotiorum . Within each trial, there were three replications of each treatment (four fungicides and a control). Statistical Analysis . The study consisted of five fungicide treatments (four fungicides and a control), and two isolates of S. sclerotiorum . Variables measured included were mycelium growth, mycelium pigmentation, and sclerotia production. Data collected on mycelium growth was subjected to analysis of variance using the general linear model procedures (PROC GLM) in SAS (SAS v ersion 9.3, SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to identify differences among treatments. Trials were considered as random effects and treatments (fungicides and control) were considered as fixed effects. To conduct an F -test, all the treatments were not pooled becau se three treatment groups (Fontelis, Omega and Propulse) had no variability for the mean growth of mycelium. Only two treatment groups (Control and Endura) were pooled to avoid the underestimation of MSE. The real issue with this data is not non -normality or unequal variance, the real issue is zero variance. Mean separation was performed using Fisher's protected LSD test, and mean differences were considered statistically significant at p 0.05. Data collected from mycelium pigmentation and sclerotia production was treated as a qualitative data in two categories i.e., yes or no. RESULTS In vitro growth of S. sclerotiorum (peanut and cabbage isolates) on fungicide -amended growth medium. Both peanut and cabbage isolates of S. sclerotiorum showed signific ant growth variations on PDA amended with each of the four fungicides (Figures 1 and 2). Mycelium growth was faster on non -amended control plates, with mycelium reaching the edge of the plates in three days. No mycelia was observed on the Propulse -amended plates, whereas those amended with Fontelis showed reduced mycelium growth, as compared to the control PDA plates. The PDA plates amended with Omega showed much reduced mycelium growth as compared to the control PDA plates and PDA plates amended with Fonte lis. In contrast, PDA plates amended with Endura showed similar mycelium growth, reaching the edge of the plate in 3 days, as of the control PDA 39 plates. Mycelium pigmentation on the control PDA plates was noticed three days after inoculation with both the isolates of S. sclerotiorum . In case of PDA plates amended with Propulse, Fontelis and Omega fungicides, growth resulted in mycelium pigmentation. Mycelium pigmentation was noticed on the PDA plates amended with Endura, four days after inocu lation with both isolates of S. sclerotiorum. Sclerotia on the control PDA plates were produced four days after inoculation with both isolates of S. sclerotiorum , whereas sclerotia production was not observed on the plates amended with fungicides. In vitro growth of peanut and cabbage isolates of S. sclerotiorum on fungicide -treated Valencia -C leaflets. Leaflets of peanut cultivar Valencia -C treated with each of the four fungicides showed significantly different effects on the growth of both isolates of S. sclerotiorum (Figures 3 and 4). Lesions were not observed on the leaflets treated with Propulse, Omega and Fontelis inoculated with both peanut and cabbage isolates of S. sclerotiorum . Leaflets treated with Endura showed lesions similar in size to the inoc ulated control, but no production of sclerotia was observed with either isolate of S. sclerotiorum . The results of two replications of the leaflet study in the growth chamber showed that all the fungicides were effective in controlling the leaflet infectio n by both isolates of S. sclerotiorum . However, lesion development was noticed on control (untreated) leaflets inoculated with both isolates. Sclerotia were produced on the control leaflets four days after inoculation with both isolates of S. sclerotiorum , whereas sclerotia production was not observed on leaflets treated with any of the four fungicides.

Materials and Methods The cotton variety trial was planted May 5, 2017 in 30 -inch rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton silty clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of single, 30 -inch rows 30 feet long. There were four replications for each entry, planted in a random complete block. Individual plots were planted at a seed rate of 5 seeds/foot. Plots were planted with a John Deere Max Emerge planter fitted with cone metering units. On April 28, the planting area was treated with herbicide Treflan @ 1.5 pt/ac as pre -plant application. After planting Dual magnum (0.8 and Caparol (1.6 pt/ac) were sprayed and Fertili applied was Nitrogen 125 lb/ac, P 2O5 40 lb/ac and 20.5 lb/ac of Sulphur. Growth regulators applied were, Stance, 3 oz/ac, on July 10, Pix 1 pt/ac on August 30, Prep 1 Qt/ac along with Def 6 on October 14 at 1 pt/ac. Total irrigation amount was 7.3 inch applied over the growing period. Precipitation received during the growing period was 19.3 inches. The plots were harvested on November 20, 2017 with a cotton stripper. Individual plot weights were recorded. For fiber quality each individual plot was hand harvested with 25 bolls randomly picked within a plot. The fiber samples were sent to Louisiana State University ginning lab after calculating the lint percent from 25 boll samples. Statistical Analysis All data were subjected to SAS\u00ae procedures for te st of significance difference between varieties. Mean separation procedures ((protected (P<0.05) least significant differences)) were used to determine where differences exist. Results and Discussion Yield data for the 2017 cotton trial are presented in Table 1, lint yield for the 16 varieties in the trial, ranged from 401 to 613 lb/ac with a trial average of 480 lbs/acre. 43 Table 1.

High temperature is one of the major factor that affects canola productivity worldwide. Therefore, understanding effect of different environmental condit ions on the productivity of diverse canola cultivars is important for including it in the crop rotation in the region. The project assumes that delaying flowering will expose it to higher daytime temperature. Canola is also a new crop in the area and info rmation related to the environment on canola involving varieties is limited. Identifying a cultivar that does good when flowering is delayed will be of great importance to the region. Objective: The objective of this project is to assess effect of delayin g flowering by mechanically removing inflorescence from diverse open pollinated and hybrid cultivars of winter canola on biomass, seed and oil formation in semiarid conditions of the Southern High Plains. Materials and Methods: This is first year of the study. The soil type at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results, recommended fertilizer of 135 -0-25-28 lbs ac-1 (N-P-K-S) was pre -plant incorporat ed into soil. Canola was planted on September 20, 2016 into a conventionally tilled seedbed using a plot drill (Model 3P600, Great Plains Drill) under center pivot irrigation; and s eeding rate was 4 lbs ac-1. Limited irrigation was provided as needed ( 11 inches in total). Treflan herbicide at 1.5 pints ac-1 was applied for weed control before planting and this is a good and commonly used herbicide for weed control in canola and some hand weeding was also done as needed. Insecticides were applied as needed f or insect control. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split plot arrangements with four replications. Stress treatments imposed through cutting of inflorescence at different stages (none/control, bolting and full - bloom) were th e main plots and winter canola cultivars (hybrid and open pollinated) were sub -plots . The trial involves 10 varieties representing both hybrid (5 varieties) and open pollinated (5 varieties) coming from diverse seed companies (such as DuPont Pioneer, Cropl an Genetics, DL Seeds Inc/Rubisco Seeds LLC, Monsanto, Kansas State University). Stress treatment imposed through cutting of inflorescence at different stages was done on April 3, 2017 (bolting stage; cutting height of 7 inches) and on April 12, 2017 (full - bloom stage; cutting height of 14 inches). Seed yield and biomass were determined on samples of canola hand harvested (June 12, 2016) at ground level from an area of 1 m2 from each plot. Plant samples were dried to a constant weight at 65\u00b0C before thresh ing with a plot combine (Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger. Yield components were determined on five randomly harvested plant samples for 45 each plot. Harvest index, calculated as the ratio of grain to total biomass (grain plus aboveground dry matter), was also determined for each plot. Seed samples from each plot was sent to the lab for oil content analysis and samples processing is underway. Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of split -plot design (stress treatment as main and canol a variety as sub -plot factors). To detect differences between stress treatments and their interactions with variety types, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion The main assumption in this trial was if we cut the inflorescence at bud formation or flowering stage, the canola plant will regrow from auxillary buds and reproduce inflorescence at a later stage. Typically, daytime temperatures increase in the region during March to May months. Thus, delayed flowering in inflorescence treated treatments will be exposed to higher temperature stress. Which significantly affects seed and oil formation. Crop established well an d reached to the recommended stage (6 -8 leaf stage) for good winter survival before the first killing frost which is critical for successful winter canola production. The most important variables, seed yield and pods numbers including biomass are presented in Tables 1 and 2. It will be interesting to find seed oil content and oil yield response to the different stress treatments included in the Tables but seed oil analysis processing is still underway. There were significant differences among inflorescence removal treatments for seed yield, pod numbers per plant, biomass and harvest index. Averaged over varieties, seed yields were 1856, 991 and 725 lbs ac-1 for control (no cutting), cutting at bolting, and cutting at full -bloom treatments, respectively (Tabl e 1). Imposing stress through cutting at flowering reduced seed yield by 61 % while cutting at bolting reduced seed yield by 47 % compared to the control (no cutting) treatment. However, there was no difference among plant cutting at bolting and full -bloom treatments for seed yield, biomass and seeds per pod. The treatment at full bloom was the least efficient plant with harvest index of just 11%, which was 50% and 26% lower compared to control and cutting at bolting treatments, respectively. Nevertheless, the result suggests that canola is sensitivity to stress at both stages to result in significant yield reduction but more so at flowering than bolting stages. Averaged over variety types, hybrids produced more seed yield than open pollinated not only und er control (no cutting) (16%) but also under cutting stress imposed at bolting treatment (7%). The highest yielding varieties from hybrid types were Hekip and Mercedes producing over 2000 lbs ac-1 while Riley and Wichita were high yielding from open polli nated group producing seed about 300 lbs ac-1 less than the hybrids. Yields of open pollinated are comparable to hybrids given the higher seed costs of hybrids. Stress imposed through cutting at bolting (47% vs 23%) and flowering (61 % vs 23%) had a less p ronounced effect on biomass than on seed yield. These results suggest that plants stressed through cutting at bolting and flowering were limited more by sink (less pods and seeds) than source (biomass) since sufficient source was produced by the plants with cutting treatments at both stages. Oil yield response of canola in relation to stress imposed through cutting is to be seen although seed yield is the major oil yield determing factor. 46 Table 1.

The crop is new for New Mexico and hybrids are being introduced into the Great Plains in recent years. Agronomic management practices like plant population, row spacing need to be standardized for both open pollinated and hybrid varieties. Canola seeds are expensive and seed cost is one of the major factor in deciding whether to grow canola or wheat by farmers in the region. In addition, an open pollinated variety seed cost is half of the cost of hybrid seeds. Therefore, seeding rate info is needed. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the response of open pollinated and hybrid canola varieties to plant population and row spacing under limited irrigation. Materials and Methods: The study was conducted during the 2015 -2016 and 2016 -2017 growing seasons at NMSU - Agricultural Science Center at Clovis. The soil type was an Olton clay loam (fine, mixed, superactive, thermic Aridic Paleustolls). Based on soil test results recommended fertilizer (N -P- K-S) was p replant soil incorporated at 65 -0-40-28.5 and 135 -0-25-23.1 lbs ac-1 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Canola was planted on September 8 and 16 for 2015 and 2016, respectively in a conventionally tilled seedbed using a commercial field drill (Model 2010HD, G reat Plains Drill) under center pivot irrigation. Irrigation was limited with total irrigation of 11. 0 and 11.7 inches in 2015 -16 and 2016 -17 growing seasons, respectively (almost the same amount). Rainfall received in 2015 -16 was 18.1inches while in 2016 -17 it was only 5.4 inches, obviously a much dryer year than that of the 2015 -16 experimental year. In both years, s eeding rate ranged from 1.9 lbs ac-1 to 3.5 lbs ac-1 depending on the variety and plant population combinations. Target plant population for hybrids was 120,000 plants per ac and for open poliinated it was 200,000 plants per ac, respectively. Hybrid variety (Safran) was planted using1.9 and 2.5 lbs ac-1in 75% and 100% population treatments, while open pollinated variety (Riley) was planted usi ng 2.5 and 3.5 lbs ac- 1in 75% and 100% population treatments, respectively. Herbicide Treflan was applied at the rate of 1.5 pints ac-1 before planting and Prowl H 2O at a rate of 3.0 pints ac-1 in late February in 2015 - 16 while in 2016 -17 growing seasons Treflan at a rate of 1.5 pints ac-1 were applied before planting for weed control. This is a good and commonly used herbicide for weed control in canola production. Hand weeding was also done as needed. Insecticides were applied as needed for insect contr ol in both years. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a split -split plot arrangements with four replications. Variety (open pollinated, Riley; and hybrid, Safran) was the main plots and plant population (75 % and 100%; target plant population of 100% for open pollinated and hybrid 48 were 200,000 and 120, 000 plants ac-1, respectively) as sub -plot. Row spacing (10 and 20 inches) was the sub -sub-plot. At plant maturity a large area of 115 ft2 was harvested (June 20 and 22, in 2016 and 2017 respectively) using a plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Ried, Austria) from each plot for seed yield determination. The seed yield was adjusted to a standard seed moisture content of 10%. Seed samples tak en from each plot was also sent to the lab for oil content analysis and samples processing for 2016 -17 growing seasons is underway. Oil content will be used for oil yield determination. Data Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed on a yearly basis a nd followed a split -split-plot design (variety type, plant population, row spacing as main -, sub -plot and sub -sub plot factors, respectively). To detect differences between the factors and their interactions, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Ins titute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion Seed yield, one of the most important variables in crop production, was significantly affected by year, reflecting the huge difference in growing conditions (rainfall in particular) occurred between the two experimental years. Similar irrigation amount was applied in both years. Seed yield produced, averaged over varieties, plant population and row spacings treatments, in 201 5-16 growing season (3481 lbs ac-1) was significantly higher than that of the 2016 -17 growing season (1356 lbs ac-1). This indicates that having enough moisture in the form of irrigation or rainfall or both is critical for achieving high seed yield in cano la. Seed yield was 11% higher in Safran compared to open pollinated variety Riley. However, in the 2016 -17 growing seasons, varieties were not significantly different for yield (Table 1). This was perhaps resulted from poor stand observed in hybrid variet y Safran than in open pollinated Riley. Previous studies reported a 10 to 20% yield advantage with hybrid than open pollinated. On the other hand, plant population (75 % 100%) and row spacing (10 and 20\") had no effect on seed yield in both years (Table 1) . Oil yield reflected the seed yield response to hybrids, plant population and row spacing. Seed oil content was not affected by any of the factors tested in this study. Results suggests that growers can achieve similar yield, even if they reduce seeding r ate by 25%. Row spacing had minimum effect on canola yield. Small yield benefit with hybrids doesn't seem to justify higher cost of seed under low input management. 49 Table 1.

Begna New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM Objective To study the effect of different soil profile moisture contents with and without pre -season irrigation as well as stage -based irrigation treatments, on seasonal water extract ion patterns, total water use, oil content and seed yield of three winter canola cultivars . Material and Methods First year study was planted on Sept 19, 2016 at the NMSU Agricultural Science Center in Clovis NM. Trial was planted using a seeding rate of 4 lbs/acre with a row spacing of 6 inches. Main plot size was 30'\u00d7 18' with 3 passes per plot and sub plot size was 30'\u00d76'. Crop was planted under centre pivot system. Fertilizers were applied upon soil testing. Three varieties, Riley, Hekip, and DKW - 46-15 were planted and subjected to different irrigation treatments. Split -split-RCBD design was used with four replications. Main factor: Pre -season Irrigation (Pre -irr) and No -Preseason Irrigation (NoPre -irr) and DKW -46-15) Neutron access tubes were installed on Sept 21, 2016 for determining soil water content. Probe readings and biomass samples were collected at differen t times throughout the growing period. For yield components, 5 plants were harvested per plot. Crop was harvested using plot combine (Model Elite Plot 2001, Wintersteiger, Reid, Austria) for seed yield, and yields was then adjusted to 10% seed moisture. Results and Discussion On an average, a soil profile refilled with pre -season irrigation increased seed yield of winter canola by 41% compared to soil profile exhausted by previous crop. Pre -irr had higher number of pods per plant and seeds per pod. While, there was no differenc e in thousand seed weight between two treatments (Table1). In general, benefit of pre -irr was more significant when in season irrigation was limited (may happen when rainfall is low). Thus, in a fully irrigated treatment, Pre -irr increased seed yield by only 15% compared to NoPre -irr (Table 2). However, in unirrig ated rainfed treatment the same increase due to Pre -irr was 81%. If the profile was refilled with water as in Pre -irr, skipping Table 1. Seed yield and yield components under main plot treatment (2016 -17).

In contra st, if there was no profile water as in NoPre -irr, even Vstss reduced seed yield by 30%. . Among varieties, Hekip performed better than others, except for Rainfed and Vstss (both under NoPre -Irr). Among yield components, pods per plant and seeds per pod influenced seed yield more than thousand seed weight. First year results showed the positive effect of pre -season irrigation on seed yield. Sesonal pattern of biomass production showed significant effect of pre -irrigation and critical stage based irrigation management, but effect due to two cultivars was not significant (Fig.1). Pre-season irrigation effect becomes more prominent during later stage of crop growth. Even, effect of stage based irrigation becomes more prominent at later growth stages. These observations suggest that winter canola tries to extract soil moisture to com pensate for lack of irrigation water. When most of the soil water is exhausted at later growh stages, irrigation treaments become more prominent. Table 2.

Forage corn is the main row crop for dairy industry, but the production system removes most of the vegetation out of field and leaves soil exposed to wind and water erosion. With wide row spacing of 30\", 3 to 6\" silage cutting height and long fallow period, the system is inefficient to conserve so il and water resources and hence corn silage system is unsustainable. Recent observations are also suggesting that bottom portion of the stem in corn is of lower quality and it lowers overall quality of forage. We hypothesized that increasing corn cutting height and decreasing row spacing has the potential to conserve soil and water and also improve forage quality without affecting forage yield significantly. Objective: On-farm demonstration research to evaluate effect of increased forage corn cutting heig ht (6 vs. 20.5\") and reduced row spacing (15 vs. 30\") on forage yield, forage quality, soil quality (soil organic matter components), soil moisture, wind dynamics and economics. Materials and Methods The project was established in spring of 2017 in dairy producer's (co -operator, Heritage Dairy Farm) field near Clovis, NM in a half -circle of a center pivot. The field has seven spans encompassing two corn row spacing, two forage corn (silage) cutting height. The experimental design is a split -plot design wi th four replications (span 4, 5, 6 and 7); row spacing and silage cutting height as main and sub -plots, respectively. Corn was planted on May 12, 2017 into no - tilled field (previous crop canola) using commercial planter (model DB60, John Deer Planter, Moli ne IL, USA). The corn variety ' 9678VT3P' was selected for the trial for both years. It was planted at 22000 seeds ac-1. Liquid fertilizer blend (32 -0-0) was pumped through sprinkler at a rate of 5.35, 6.58 and 5.59 tons in June 16, 24 and July 27, 2018 resulting in total equivalent of 187 lbs ac-1 of nitrogen. Herbicide Glyphosate and Keystone nxt at 32oz and 1.4 qt ac-1 in May 13 and Glyphosate and Status at 32 oz and 2 oz qt ac-1 in June 24, 2017 were applied for weed control. The field operation foll ows producer's management practices. Crop was irrigated although the availability of irrigation water was limited (13 inches in total). Soil samples were taken in May 18, 2017 before fertilizer application and after final harvest in fall. Samples were take n by a graduate student (partially funded by this grant) guided by supervisor (Co -PI) with the GPS grid mapping approach prepared earlier. Samples processing/analysis for soil organic matter components (such 54 as mineralisable carbon, nitrogen, available pho sphorus, and inorganic N (NH 4 and NO 3) is underway and to be continued including on soil samples taken in October of 2017 after forage harvest. Soil quality, forage yield and quality will be assessed each year. A strip of 20 ft wide in the center of each p lots of varying length depending on the span size (ranging from 1983 ft to 3680 ft) was harvested using producer's commercial forage chopper and collected in a separate truck. Plot weights were determined by weighing the truck with and without forgae from the plot. Two samples of about 500 grams were collected from each plot harvest and placed in paper bags and plastic bags for estimation of moisture content and nutritive value. After fresh weights were recorded, samples were dried to a constant weight at 6 50C. Dried and fresh weights were used to estimate forage biomass production per acre. The dried samples were ground to pass through a 1 - mm screen using a Wiley Mill (Thomas Manufacturing) and submitted to the certified Laboratory in University of Wisconsi n to estimate nutritive values using near -infrared spectroscopy and Milk 2000 technology. A cover cropping (Rye -winter pea mixture, variety Elbon and Austrian, respectively) treatment was also added in the section of the field (span 1, 2 and 3) in conj unction with short cut/stubble height and narrower spacing after forage harvest for comparisons with other treatments mentioned above. The rye -pea mixture (65:35 %) was planted at 41 lbs ac-1 rate. Cover crop was planted in November of 2017. Once cover cro p was established sensors were set for wind and soil moisture dynamics monitoring. Sensors (wind and soil temperature) for microclimate observations were set in December of 2017 and monitoring of wind, temperature and periodical soil moisture readings (wi th portable soil moisture reader) under the different corn cutting/stubble height -row spacing combination treatments including cover crop treatment is underway. Since the project is being conducted in producer's field it involves a lot of coordination. Col lection of production records (such as seeding rate, seed type, irrigation events, and nutrient and pesticide applications) is going on and a process to continue until the end of the second year of forage production cycle in 2018. Many phone calls and text ing were done between the principal investigator, researchers and farm managers, between PI and producer's farm manager, in particular, to coordinate activities for a smooth operation. Data Analysis Forage yield and quality data were analyzed using SAS pro cedure. Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of split -plot design (row spacing as main and silage cutting height as sub - plot factors). To detect differences between row spacing treatments and their interactions with silage cutting heights types, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion Forage yield and quality results involving row spacing and silage cutting heights are presented in Table 1.The row spacing by silage cutting height interaction effect was not significant for both forage yield and quality. Significant difference was detecte d between 15\" than 30\" row spacing for dry and green forage yield, and moisture at harvest, crude protein, starch and milk per acre. The two row spacings, however, were not significantly different for the other measured parameters although modest improveme nt in forage quality existed with the wider than the narrower spacing. 55 Dry forage yield was higher with 15 than 30\" row spacing (7.3 vs. 6.2 t/ac) which was also reflected in milk production per acre (24210 vs. 20494 lbs/ac). Similarly, significant difference was detected between 6\" than 20.5\" silage cutting heights for dry and green forage yield, moisture at harvest, nitrate and milk per acre. Dry forage yield and milk production per acre were reduced by 15 % with silage cutting height of 20.5\" comp ared to the 6\" cutting height although no significance difference was detected between the two cutting heights for milk production per ton. In general, a modest improvement in forage quality was observed with increasing silage cutting height including redu ction in fibers content (5%), an increase in starch content (5%), a reduction in nitrate content (46%) in forage. In a separate trial conducted at NMSU - Agricultural Science Center at Clovis involving three silage cutting heights (6, 13, 20.5\") and five corn varieties revealed similar reduction in dry forage yield with the highest silage cutting height. However, yield reduction with 13\" cutting height was only 5% suggesting producers can cut corn at this height with minimum yield loss. In the long run, tall stubble (with higher silage cutting heights) in conjunction with narrow row spacing is expected to leave more plant residue in the field potentially resulting in better soil coverage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestr ation, and in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming systems and rural economies in New Mexico. The study will be repeated in 2018.56 Table 1. Effects of corn row spacing and silage cutting height on forage y ield and quality on producer's field near Clovis.

To evaluate diverse forage corn varieties response to three silage corn cutting heights on forage yield, quality, and economic profitability. Materials and Methods This is a two years project and the first year of the study was conducted at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis in 2017. Based on soil test results recommended fertilizer was applied at a rate of 15 (N), 50 (P 2O5) lbs ac-1, 3qt ac-1 (Zn) in April 18 and 152 (N), 27.5 (S) lbs ac-1 at plant. Additional 50 (N), and 9 (S) lbs ac-1 was pumped through sprinkler in August 2, 2017. Herbicide mixture Atrazine, Balance Flex, Diflex, Charger Basic, Glyphosate was applied at plant at 1 pint, 2 oz, 8 oz, 1 pint and 40 oz ac-1, respectively for weed control. Additional herbicide mixture of Diflex and Brawl at 10 oz and 1 pint ac-1 was applied for weed control in June 20, 2017. The experimental design was a split -plot design with three replications with forage corn cutting heights and corn varieties as main and sub -plots, respectively. Three forage cutting heights (6, 13, and 20.5\") and five diverse corn varieties differing in forage yield potential and quality were used in the study. Corn varieties used were 9678VT3P, 1151AQ, D58QC72, P1449xr (brown mid rib, BMR) and 1197P. Corn was planted in May 19, 2017 at seeding rate of 27,000 seeds ac-1. Forage harvest was done in September of 2017 with a tractor -drawn commercial forage chopper and forage mater ials were collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. About 500 grams sample was used for quality of forge by using the methods mentioned in previous trial conducted on farmers field. Data Analysis Forage yield and quality data were ana lyzed using SAS procedure. Statistical analysis was performed on the basis of split -plot design (silage cutting height as main and variety as sub -plot factors). To detect differences between row spacing treatments and their interactions with silage cutting heights types, PROC GLM procedures were used (SAS 9.3, SAS Institute Inc.). Significance was considered at P < 0.05, and Fisher's protected LSD was used to separate means. Results and Discussion Forage yield and quality results involving silage cutting he ight and variety are presented in Tables 1 and 2. The silage cutting height by variety interaction effect was not significant for both forage yield and quality. Significant difference was detected between the cutting height treatments for dry and green forage yield, milk per acre and nitrate content in forage. The three silage cutting heigh t treatments, however, were not significantly different for the other measured parameters although modest improvement in forage quality existed with an increase in silage cutting heights. Dry forage yield was higher with 6.0 than 20.5\" silage cutting heigh t (9.3 vs. 7.8 t/ac) which was also reflected in milk production per acre (30758 vs. 26435 lbs/ac). In general, a modest improvement in forage quality was observed with increasing silage cutting height including reduction in fibers content (5 to 12%), an i ncrease in starch content (13 to 15%), a reduction in nitrate content (34 to 56%) in forage. Dry forage yield of 13.0\" silage cutting height treatment was not significantly different 58 from that of 6.0\" (8.8 vs. 9.3 t/ac) suggesting raising the cutting heigh t to13\" (5% reduction in yield) can be used as a strategy to improve soil and water conservation with a modest improvement in forage quality and minimum forage yield loss in forage corn production systems. Four of the five corn varieties were not significantly different for forage yield and milk production per acre but produced higher forage and milk per acre than corn variety P1449xr (brown midrib variety). The five varieties tested in the study, however, were not significantly different for the other measured parameters. In the long run, tall stubble (with higher silage cutting heights of at least 13\") in conjunction with a corn variety of producer choice is expected to leave more plant residue in the field potentially resulting in better soil cov erage, improvement in soil conservation and moisture retention, carbon sequestration, and in overall improvement and sustainability of forage corn production and hence dairy farming systems and rural economies in New Mexico. The study will be repeated in 2 018.59 Table 1. Effects of corn silage cutting heights on forage yield and quality at NMSU -Agricultural Science Center at Clovis.

Scott1 1 New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM 88101 Objective To evaluate dry matter and green forage yield and nutritive value of dryland forage sorghums submitted for testing in the New Mexico Corn and Sorghum Performan ce Trials. Materials and Methods All 16 forage sorghum entries were planted on June 20, 2017 into 30 -in rows under center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton clay loam and elevation is 4,435 ft. Individual plots consisted of two, 30 -inch rows, 20 fee t long. Plots were planted with a two -cone planter at a rate of 50,000 seeds/acre. Prior to planting, the planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 30 and 20 lbs/acre of nitrogen and P 2O5, respectively. Micronutrients of sulfur and zinc al so were applied pre -plant at rates of 4.4 lbs/ac and 1 qt/acre, respectively. Fertilizers were incorporated into soil immediately after application. Total irrigation amount was 1.0 inch applied immediately following planting to ensure successful emergen ce. Glyphosate and Detonate herbicides were applied to plots for weed control prior to plant at rates of 48 oz/acre and 8 oz/ac. Sharpen, atrazine and, glyphosate were applied on June 19 at 1.5 oz/ac, 1.5 pt/ac, and 48 oz/ac, respectively. Dimilin was app lied at plant at a rate of 2 oz/ac and Sivanto at 7 oz/ac was applied on August 30. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the plots was 17.0 inches. Plots were harvested on October 25, 2017 with a tractor -drawn commercial forage chopper and forage material was collected in a large basket where plot weight was determined. After plot weight was recorded, approximately 500 grams of freshly cut forage were placed in brown paper bags for later estimation of moisture content and nutri tive value. Samples were dried for 72 hours prior to dry matter determination. Dry forage was ground with a Thomas -Wiley Mill to pass a 1 mm screen and ground material was sent to the University of Wisconsin for quality analyses via near infrared reflect ance spectroscopy (NIRS) and Milk 2000 technology. Results and Discussion Data for the forage sorghum performance trial are presented in Table 2. Highest yielding varieties exceeded 5.80 tons of dry matter. Mean dry forage and wet forage yields for the 16 varieties were 4.70 and 15.4 tons/acre, respectively, and varieties differed (P < 0.05) with respect to yield. All forage quality parameters were significantly different among the varieties. Crude protein averaged 8.5 percent for the test. 61 Table 1.

Mesbah1, B. Niece1, A. Scott1, 1 New Mexico State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM 88101 Objective To evaluate ensilage production potential through dry matter harvests and nutritive value of cool - season, small grain varieties submitted for testing at the Agricultural Science C enter at Clovis. Materials and Methods Plots were established under center pivot irrigation in an Olton clay loam soil. All varieties were planted on October 14, 2016 at the rate of 100 lb/acre with a plot drill. Individual plots consisted of 11 rows, 6.25 inches apart and 8 feet long and were arranged in a RCB Design with three replications. One entry of SlickTrit II triticale was planted at 120 lb/acre. On October 10, 2016, the planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 40, and 25 lbs/ac re of nitrogen, and P 2O5 respectively. Plots were topdressed with 52 lbs/acre of nitrogen February 17, 2017. All fertilizer applications were based on soil test results and recommendations. Lorsban (1pt/acre) was applied on March 4, 2017 in order to con trol greenbug populations. Herbicides applied during the study period included Affinity BroadSpec (0.6 oz/ac), Lo -Vol 6 (12 oz/ac), and Prowl H2O (3pts/ac) on March 4, 2017. These small grains were managed for a one -cut, silage oriented harvest in sprin g of 2017. Harvests began on April 10, 2017 with the earliest maturing species (rye and triticale) and continued through May 4. Plants were harvested at boot stage (Feekes scale: 10.0 -10.3; Zadoks scale: 45 -53) for maximum forage quality. Although yield is maximized at later growth stages, cutting earlier at boot to early head stages allows for a balance of good yields and optimum nutritive value. Considering the high nutritional needs of dairy cattle in the region and the common practice of double crop ping with corn or sorghum, an early cutting of forages was deemed most appropriate for the area. All plots were harvested with a sickle bar mower set at a height of 2 inches, and total plot weights were obtained to estimate yield on both a green forage an d dry matter basis. Canopy height and lodging data were collected at harvest. Results and Discussion Yield data are presented in Table 1 and forage quality data are presented in Table 2. Total precipitation and irrigation amounts were less in 2016 -2017 (4.07 in.) than in the previous year (10.58 in.). Yields from the 2016 -2017 season were slightly lower than 2015 -2016 and averaged 12.7 and 4.7 tons/acre for green forage and dry forage, respectively. Forage nutritive value declined with increased yield. The general trend was that as dry matter yield increased, crude protein and dNDF were reduced and fiber proportions increased. Although all varieties were harvested at the same maturity stage, often times greater yields result in proportionately less pro tein and increased fiber. 69 Table 1.

Scott1, 1New State University, Agricultural Science Center at Clovis, NM 88101 Objective Test the adaptability and yield performance of newly developed wheat varieties and selections grown under irrigated and dryland conditions at Clovis, New Mexico. Materials and Methods The irrigated winter wheat trial was planted October 13, 2016 into a conventionally tilled flat bed plots for center pivot irrigation. Soil type is an Olton clay loam and elevation is 4,435 feet. Individual plots consisted of 11 rows, 6.25 inches apart, 30 feet long. There were three replications for each entry, planted in a randomized complete block design. Individual plots were planted at a rate of 70 lb/ac irrigated and 30 lb/ac dryland. Plots were planted with a Great Plains solid stand plot drill (3600). The irrigated planting area was fertilized with a pre -plant mixture of 40, and 25 lb/ac of nitrogen, and P 205 respectively. Fertilizers were incorporated into soil immediately after application. Additional nitrogen was applied on February 17, 2017 at a rate of 52 lb/ac, respectively. Affinity, Lo-Vol6 (2,4 -D), and Prowl H20 herbicides were applied at a rate of 0.6 oz/ac and 12 oz/ac, and 3 pt/ac respectively on March 4, 2017. Lorsban 4E (chlorpyrifos) insecticide was applied at a rate 1 pt /ac on March 4, 2017. Prosaro\u00ae fungicide was applied at a rate of 6.5 oz/ac on April 27 to control the spread of leaf and stripe rust. Total irrigation amount for the trial was 24.1 inches. The amounts were applied during October, February, March, April , May and June. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest of the irrigated plots was 7.2 inches. Height, lodging, and date of bloom measurements were collected during the growing season. The trial was harvested on June 22, 2017 with a WinterSteiger combine. A Harvest Master HM 800 Classic Grain Gage was used to determine percent moisture and test weight (lb/bu). The dryland trial was planted on October 11, 2016 in the same manner as described above, except at a seeding rate of 30 pound s/acre. The planting area was not furrowed. 36 lb/ac of nitrogen was applied pre -plant. Fertilizers applied on March, 9, 2017 were 30 lb/ac, and 5.5 lb/ac of nitrogen and sulphur respectively. Herbicides applied on March 9, 2017 include Affinity, Lo -Vol6 (2,4 - D), and Govern at a rate of 0.6 oz/ac and 12 oz/ac, and 1 pt/ac respectively. Precipitation during the period after planting until harvest was 7.7 inches. Dryland plots were harvested on June 14, 2016 in the same manner as described above for the irrigated trial. Results and Discussion Yield data for 2016 -2017 are presented in Tables 1 and 2 for the irrigated and dryland trial. Grain yields for the irrigated trial averaged 61.8 bushel/acre.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor with l imited experience in working in agriculture. Dairying is vastly becoming a highly technical, highly automated industry characterized by extended periods of very low margins. Highly skilled and technically proficient labor is an absolute must for optimal pe rformance. However, limited educational opportunities exist for training and educating the next generation of owners, managers and employees to prepare and refine a skilled and able dairy workforce to continue to provide wholesome dairy products for New Me xico, the nation and the world, while sustainably managing animals, employees and the environment. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Given the unlikelihood of re -establishing an on -campus dairy herd for training and education, NMSU Dairy Extension established in 2008 t he U.S. Dairy Education and Training Consortium (USDETC) together with the Univ. of Arizona and Texas A&M Univ. The USDETC, located in Clovis, NM utilizes Clovis Community College facilities and commercial dairy operations in the New Mexico and Texas bord er region to teach the next generation of dairy owners and managers during a 6 -week, hands -on, capstone summer class advanced dairy herd management (ANSC 468). Students are instructed by leading faculty in the nation. The program is an intensive combinatio n of classroom instruction, laboratory training, on - farm practice and allied industry input. Many of the students leave Clovis with internships and job opportunities in hand. Area dairy producers, center to the success of the program, fully recognize and s upport the unique value, freely allowing students access and insight to their operations. REACH: Reach of the program in 10 years: 427 students from 48 different universities. A survey of former students was conducted in 2017 to determine the impact of th e consortium on their careers (62% response rate). Of the 213 respondents, 99 were currently still enrolled at a university, 111 were employed and 3 were not employed. Of the students enrolled at a university 37% were undergraduate students, 30% were worki ng towards advanced degrees and 30% were obtaining a veterinary degree. Of those employed, 87 students had obtained a BS, while 11 completed their MS, 2 students were Ph.D.'s and 9 students had graduated with a DVM degree. Key finding: of the students who had entered the job market 34% had found employment on a dairy, 33% were employed in a dairy related position (allied industry), 5% were in a non -dairy livestock positon, 6% were in a non -dairy ag position and 21% were employed outside of agriculture. In s hort: 4 out of 5 former USDETC students are employed in agriculture, 2 out of 3 students are employed in the dairy industry, and 1 out of 3 students are working on, or managing a dairy. IMPACT: When asked \"What impact attending the consortium had on their current status\", 92% replied important, very important or extremely important. When asked about the impact the classes and experiential learning experiences had on their course work and subsequent careers, 44% replied extremely helpful, 35% very helpful a nd 15% helpful. When asked to rank the consortium 75 classes as compared to other courses taken, 55% gave the consortium an A+ and 36% an A. When asked for comments, the hands -on experience and access to exceptional faculty were the student's main responses. In short: the USDETC has proven to be a positive alternative, or complementary education opportunity for students who do not or have limited access to dairy courses or the related experiential learning experiences at their home universities. NEXT: with th e Dairy Consortium as a capstone dairy course, NMSU's College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences in June of 2017 reinstated an undergraduate minor in Dairy Science. As the Dairy Consortium continues to grow opportunities for expansion are being considered to in addition to the open -lots of the Southwest, add learning experiences in the barns of the Midwest and the free -stall operations of the West. All with the goal to provide the next generation of dairy owners and managers with excellent educational opportunities.

NM dairy owners employ approximately 1 employee/100 cows: predominantly hired, immigrant labor. A large majorit y of dairy employees have or had little or no experience working in agriculture or with large animals or large equipment. Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing AFF) ranks among the most dangerous industrial sectors with an incident rate of 5.7 non -fatal occupa tional injuries per 100 FTE's and a rate of 23.2 fatal work injuries per 100,000 FTE's (BLS). In addition, about one -fifth of fatalities in 2016 were to foreign -born workers and roughly two -thirds of fatal work injuries were foreign - born Latino or Hispanic workers. Effective training and education of both current and future dairy employees is imperative for both safety and performance. However, limited educational opportunities exist to train and certify a skilled and able dairy workforce. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: Beginning in 2011 -12 with the development of two dairy safety awareness training DVD's in English and Spanish to accomplish multiple goals: 1. being able to document employees are trained on dairy safety issues, 2. improve job performance through understanding the \"why\" of work - and safety -procedures and 3. to prevent safety incidents through heightened safety awareness. To date approximately 6,000 copies have been distributed worldwide, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC) subsequently transl ated the DVD's into a number of other languages for placement of refugees on dairies. The remaining question: what is the training effectiveness of viewing a DVD? Delivery of training content became center in training effectiveness evaluation. In collabora tion with Dr. David Douphrate, UT School of Public Health, San Antonio Campus, small interactive video/audio vignettes were created in Articulate 360 and subsequently loaded on an IPad for individualized training purposes (m -learning). REACH: As part of t wo DOL Susan Harwood projects a total of 2,090 dairy employees in 7 states on 60+ farms were trained using mobile technology on iPads. The large majority of trainees were foreign -born with the majority from Mexico (52.4%), and 27.4% from Guatemala, Hondura s and El Salvador. About 88% male and 12% female. Average age 34.4 +12.0. About 6% had not received any education, 28% had attended (some) elementary school, 24% (some) middle school, 29% (some) high school, and 13% had received (some) higher education. As anticipated, reading comprehension was a challenge, making the video/audio delivery method critical. We realized soon that many of the Central American trainees didn't speak any English or Spanish, but communicated in a Mayan language (K'iche). Training ef fectiveness evaluation (Kirkpatrick Four - Level Training Evaluation) analysis suggests that participants rated the m -learning training favorably (level -1). Pre -test to post -test scores changed from a 74.2% to a 92.5% (level -2). Interview results at about 3 -6 months post -training (level -3) indicate workers were applying the knowledge gained from the training in their work activities, as well as reporting safety hazards when identified. Findings suggest the utilization of m -learning techniques is an effective means to deliver safety awareness training content to dairy workers in remote and challenging work environments. 77 IMPACT: NMSU Dairy Extension has now provided safety awareness training to about one -third of the NM dairy workforce. We have added safe anima l handling with live demonstration to our training tools, and are rolling this out in 2018. In 2016 as a result of a several highly publicized dairy fatalities in the Northwest, Idaho Dairymen's Association (IDA) took the lead in adopting our program with significant processor and co -op support. We were asked to help recruit and prepare a dairy safety specialist for IDA. The person was hired in July of 2017, and is currently providing safety awareness training for Idaho dairy producers. Recognizing we were missing about 1 out of 3 -4 workers due to language issues, we just completed full translation and voiceover of all video materials into K'iche, a menu option to be added to the iPad library. NEXT: Sparked by consumer questions, National Milk Producers Federation representing the majority of the U.S. milk supply has just formed (Nov. 2017) a Dairy Safety Task Force looking at national adaptation and implementation of the program. Continued content d evelopment: safe feeds and feeding (2018) , safe young stock handling, safe hospital care and safe maternity care are the next items on our list. In Feb. 2018 a 5 -yr. leadership development project will commence, addressing the needs of frontline superviso rs and middle managers to learn more about managing people vs. managing cows.

Each year in the United Sta tes, 2 million people are infected with antimicrobial resistant organisms resulting in 23,000 deaths and 70 billion dollars in medical costs. As resistance becomes more common, cost is expected to continue to rise in order to fight infections. To combat re sistance, the Obama administration generated The National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic -Resistant Bacteria aimed at better surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, better diagnostic testing, and the development of new vaccines and antibiotics, amon g other things. Antimicrobial drug resistance is of great concern for both animal and human health. Using antimicrobials to treat illness is a key element used by veterinarians and physicians alike to combat bacterial diseases. The Food and Drug Administr ation (FDA) is charged with evaluating both the effectiveness and safety of these compounds. During the process of approving new animal drugs, a slaughter withdrawal period is established for each drug. The slaughter withdrawal time is the number of days b etween the last time an animal is treated and when the animal can be slaughtered for meat to go into the human food supply. To date, the slaughter withdrawal time has been based upon the duration of time when a drug is still in the animal tissue. There has been little to no consideration as to what management practices might be needed to minimize the risk of antimicrobial drug resistance. WHAT HAS BEEN DONE: This research project is to evaluate whether a voluntary extended withdrawal time could potentially reduce the level of bacteria resistant to an antibiotic (the specific antibiotic used for this study will be ceftiofur) that are being shed at time of slaughter. The ultimate goal of the project is to identify viable management options for producers to re duce the potential exposure of consumers to resistant bacteria and to develop strategies that result in voluntary adoption of those management options. Overall, the goal is to ensure cattle are released to slaughter with levels of antibiotic resistant micr obial populations comparable to their resistance level before being given an antibiotic. A decision -making tool will subsequently be created and made available for dairy farmers and veterinarians to use for the development of antimicrobial stewardship programs. Additionally, developing a stewardship protocol beneficial to farmers, ranchers, and veterinarians is important for food safety. REACH: To date, we are nearing the completion of both sampling periods on the 4 cooperating dairies. Samples have been p repared and submitted for further analysis at Texas A&M University.
