We're covering every single category of your home so no matter what you're cleaning, we've got a non-toxic option. When it comes to the food we eat, by now most of us are aware of the harmful effects of chemicals like pesticides, additives, and preservatives. We know that ingesting those harmful chemicals and toxins can be detrimental to our health. And we try to avoid them as much as possible. We're also starting to become more aware of the chemicals that are going into beauty and skincare products as well. Since our skin is our largest organ, we know that what we're putting onto our skin is getting soaked up and into our bloodstream. So again, trying to avoid those chemicals whenever possible. But what about the products we're using inside our home? Are we even considering the harsh and toxic chemicals that we're using to clean our counters, wash our dishes, clean our clothes, use on our floors, etc.? I would say for many of us, the answer is no. Luckily, there are TONS of options out there for non-toxic cleaning products. And across every category as well! So today I'm rounding up some of the best non-toxic cleaning products and sharing some of my favorites (including which I use in my own home). Even if you just swap one of the products you're using for one of these non-toxic options, my heart will be so happy! NOTE: this post has been updated since the original publishing and all products have been approved through EWG Best Non-Toxic All-Purpose Cleaners All-purpose cleaners are just as they - used on most surfaces! That means you're likely using these cleaners are surfaces that are getting used frequently, like counters, coffee tables, handles and other things you're touching all the time. If you're using traditional cleaners, then not only are you getting them on your hands, but they're probably also getting on some of your food. I have found this to be the easiest switch, as there are so many fantastic options out there! The best non-toxic all-purpose cleaners I have All-Purpose Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2r7ZOTp) Best Non-Toxic Disinfectant Wipes The next category I want to share is disinfecting wipes. I use these constantly in my kitchen to clean up the counters, so their one of those things that are almost always going to get on my food. I have a few different options for non-toxic wipes, but I also included some non-toxic sanitizing wipes and some non-toxic screen wipes (for your computer or cell phone). [Seventh Generation Disinfectant Wipes](http://l.thrv.me/ar-seventh-gen-disinfectant-wipes) [CleanWell Hand Sanitizing Wipes](http://l.thrv.me/ar-cleanwell-hand-sanitize-wipes) [Spruce & Co Screen Clean Wipes](http://l.thrv.me/ar-spruce-co-screen-cleaning-wipes) Best Non-Toxic Kitchen Cleaning Essentials The kitchen is where we prepare our food, so even if we're eating super clean, organic food, if we're cleaning with toxic chemicals, we're negating that. If you think about all the things you're using in your kitchen to clean, you'll quickly see where the chemicals add up. It's not just our counters - it's the soap we're using to clean our pots, pans, and cutting boards, is the detergent we're using to clean all of our dishes and silverware. Each of those things is touching our food and therefore transferring their chemicals into our bodies. I'm giving you a pretty big list of non-toxic kitchen cleaning products, so feel free to pick and choose what makes sense for you: [Thrive Market Lavender Dish Soap](http://l.thrv.me/ar-thrive-market-lav-dish-soap) [Honest [Thrive Market Fragrance-Free Dishwasher Detergent Packs](http://l.thrv.me/ar-thrive-market-dishwasher) Best Non-Toxic Bathroom Cleaners This one to me is a little less important because I'm not necessarily ingesting things that are touching the surfaces in my bathroom. But nevertheless, I am physically touching these surfaces, so it's another one of those areas to think about cleaning up. One of the things I recently thought about was the importance of a non-toxic toilet bowl cleaner as sometimes Trevi drinks the freshwater in our toilet (yes, it's gross, but it's a reality for many pet owners). I want to make sure that she's not ingesting chemicals as well, so I instantly made the switch. On this list of non-toxic bathroom cleaners, we have tub/tile cleaners, as well as the toilet bowl cleaners: [Branch Basics Bathroom Cleaner](https://bit.ly/3dSa75x) [Seventh Generation Tub + Shower Cleaner](https://amzn.to/37qtWj5) [Seventh Generation Toilet Bowl Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2PVdDTS) [Ecover Pine Fresh Toilet Bowl Cleaner](http://l.thrv.me/ar-ecover-pine-fresh-t-cleaner) Best Non-Toxic Laundry Detergent This category is a biggie, friends! Why? Because you are wearing and touching these chemicals all the time! Think about it... you wash your clothes, your towels, your sheets, your kitchen rags, your pillowcases. Pretty much everything that you're coming in contact with on a constant basis. Unfortunately, this isn't something many of us think about, but luckily there are non-toxic laundry options for all the categories. We've got detergents, brighteners, stain removers, softeners, and even non-toxic [Branch Basics Oxygen Boost Stain Remover](https://bit.ly/31vrdkC) Best Non-Toxic Glass Cleaners Next, we'll talk about glass and mirror cleaners. I would say for me, these are the lowest priority on the list because frankly I'm just not using them much. I don't have many mirrors in my apartment and we don't clean our own windows (that's a building thing), so I've had the same non-toxic glass cleaner for about 3 years. Either way though, there are some good options out there: [Branch Basics Glass Cleaner](https://bit.ly/3dSa75x) [Thrive Market Glass & Mirror [Green Shield Organic Glass Cleaner](https://amzn.to/2FGX6ys) [Biokleen Glass Cleaner Spray](https://amzn.to/2P39ubi) Best Non-Toxic Household Cleaners And finally, we're finishing out our non-toxic cleaning post with a general category. These are the cleaning items you might not use often but still have stashed away in your cupboard. Things like furniture cleaner, wood cleaner, stainless steel cleaners, drain cleaners, etc. All those things we don't think about - and maybe don't use often - but can still be full of harmful chemicals. If you don't use these types of items often, here's what I suggest doing: Go through your cupboard. If you've had something for 3+ years, toss it and get a new one. If not, wait until you've finished the bottle of the stuff you have and replace it with the non-toxic version!

Also, just a reminder that you don't have to make the switch all at once. I would suggest doing an audit of what you have and determining what items you want to switch out first. Items I think you should change out immediately include: - All-purpose cleaner - Disinfecting wipes - Dish soap - Dish detergent - Laundry detergent Otherwise, you can take it a little slower and change them out as you use older ones up! What's Your Favorite Non-Toxic Cleaning Product? So I'd love to hear from you: do you use any of these products at home? Is there a brand I might be missing? Let me know "}
