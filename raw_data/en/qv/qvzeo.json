HDLT can treat all areas of the body.", "sitename": "Bodyology", "date": "2021-02-02", "cleaned_text": "High Dose Laser Therapy High Dose Laser Therapy (HDLT) is one of the most powerful medical lasers available on the market that is used for [treating sports injuries](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3799051/), [chronic pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6454183/), [wounds](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8276284/), and [neuropathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6689877/). Often referred to as a \"Cold Laser\", High Power Therapeutic Lasers take a high amount of laser energy, but instead of beam collimation you get beam divergence resulting in tissue stimulation. The laser is pain free and each session only takes about 10-15 minutes. Patients are able to experience immediate pain relief because of the lasers ability to calm the nerves. Most importantly, the laser actually repairs injured tissue instead of just providing temporary relief. This is possible because of the depth the laser is able to penetrate under the surface when applied; thus stimulating ATP. - Improved healing and recovery times by 50-75% - Immediate pain relief - Reduced numbness and tingling - Improved blood flow and oxygenation to tissues - Decreased inflammation - Drug free, non-invasive, safe to use daily, no downtime, no side effects - Accelerated Tissue Repair - Accelerated Cell Growth - Faster wound Healing - Reduced Scar Tissue Formation - Improved Vascular Activity - Increased Metabolic Activity - Improved Nerve Function - Immunoregulation Results come from the laser's ability to \"bio-stimulate\" tissue growth and repair. This results in accelerated wound healing with a dramatic decrease in pain, inflammation and scar tissue formation. Unlike all other treatment modalities, laser therapy actually \"heals\" tissue and is a powerful non-addictive drug free form of pain management. HDLT's superior results come from its ability to deliver healing laser energy to the target tissues at any depths. Simply put - when it comes to traditional neuro-musculoskeletal medicine or wound care, HDLT is outperforming traditional therapy, safely and without side effects. "}
