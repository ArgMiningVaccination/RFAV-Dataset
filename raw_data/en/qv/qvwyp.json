Administration Don't dilute with dextrose-containing solutions or mix with other drugs. Obtain CBC before each dose; increase frequency in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia before starting therapy. Don't administer day-1 or day-8 dose if any of the following occurs: Absolute neutrophil count less than 1,000/mm3, platelet count less than 75,000/mm3, or Grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities. Delay day-8 dose for maximum of 1 week. If toxicities don't resolve or improve to Grade 2 severity by day 15, omit dose. If toxicities resolve or improve to Grade 2 severity by day 15, give drug at reduced dosage and initiate next cycle no sooner than 2 weeks later. Delay drug administration and reduce subsequent doses in patients who experience febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days. Withhold drug in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to Grade 2 or less. Don't reescalate dosage after it has been reduced. Adverse reactions CNS: headache, dizziness, asthenia, fatigue, peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, depression CV: prolonged QT interval EENT: increased lacrimation GI: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, stomatitis, dry mouth back pain, bone muscle spasm, muscular weakness Respiratory: cough, dyspnea, upper tract infection Skin: alopecia, Interactions Drug-diagnostic tests. ALT: increased level Potassium: decreased level Patient monitoring Monitor CBC with differential and renal and hepatic function tests closely. Monitor serum magnesium and potassium levels periodically during therapy. Monitor ECG in patients with congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, or if patients are taking drugs known to prolong QT interval, including Class Ia and III antiarrhythmics. Monitor patients closely for signs and symptoms of peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy. Patient teaching Instruct patient to immediately report abnormal heartbeats, dizziness, or faintness. Advise patient to promptly report fever, chills, burning or pain on urination, cough, or numbness, tingling, or burning of hands and feet. Advise female patient of childbearing age of potential hazard to fetus if drug is used during pregnancy and to inform prescriber if she becomes pregnant while taking drug. Advise breastfeeding patient that she should decide whether to discontinue breastfeeding or discontinue drug, taking into account importance of drug for her treatment. As appropriate, review all other significant and life-threatening adverse reactions and interactions, especially those related to the tests mentioned above. eribulin(e-rib-yoo-lin) , Halaven(trade name) counts) to 2 wk| Contraindications/Precautions Adverse Reactions/Side Effects Central nervous system - fatigue (most frequent) - weakness (most frequent) - depression - dizziness - headache - insomnia Ear, Eye, Nose, Throat - lacrimation Cardiovascular - QTc prolongation (life-threatening) - peripheral edema Respiratory - cough (most frequent) - dyspnea (most frequent) - upper respiratory tract infection Gastrointestinal - pancreatitis (life-threatening) - anorexia (most frequent) - constipation (most frequent) - nausea (most frequent) - abdominal pain - abnormal taste - dry mouth - dyspepsia - mucusitis - diarrhea - vomiting Dermatologic - alopecia (most frequent) - rash Fluid and Electrolyte - hypokalemia Hematologic - anemia - neutropenia Musculoskeletal - arthralgia (most frequent) - myalgia (most frequent) Neurologic - peripheral neuropathy (most frequent) Miscellaneous - fever (most frequent) - urinary tract infection Interactions Drug-Drug interaction risk of bone marrow depression with other antineoplastics or radiation therapy. antibody response and risk of adverse reactions with live virus vaccines.

Availability Nursing implications Nursing assessment - Assess for peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy (numbness, tingling, burning in hands or feet). Withhold eribulin in patients who experience Grade 3 or 4 peripheral neuropathy until resolution to Grade 2 or less. - Monitor ECG periodically as indicated. - Lab Test Considerations: Monitor CBC prior to each dose; frequency of monitoring in patients who develop Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias. Delay administration and reduce subsequent doses in patients who develop febrile neutropenia or Grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer than 7 days. - Monitor electrolytes periodically during therapy. Potential Nursing DiagnosesActivity intolerance Implementation - Correct hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia prior to initiating therapy. Intravenous Administration - Do not administer on Day 1 or Day 8 if: ANC <1000/mm3, platelets <75,000/mm3, or Grade 3 or 4 nonhematological toxicities occur. - Day 8 dose may be delayed for a maximum of 1 wk: If toxicities do not resolve or improve to Grade 2 severity by Day 15, omit dose. - If toxicities resolve or improve to Grade 2 by Day 15, administer eribulin at a reduced dose and initiate next cycle no sooner than 2 wk later. - If a dose has been delayed for toxicity and toxicities have recovered to Grade 2 severity or less, resume eribulin at a reduced dose of 1.1 mg/m2. - Permanently reduce 1.4 mg/m2 eribulin dose to 1.1 mg/m2 if: ANC <500/mm3 for >7 days, ANC <1000/mm3 either fever or infection, platelets <25,000/mm3, platelets <50,000/mm3 requiring transfusion, nonhematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicities, or omission or delay of Day 8 eribulin dose in previous cycle for toxicity. - Permanently reduce 1.4 mg/m2 eribulin dose to 0.7 mg/m2 if: occurrence of any event requiring permanent dose reduction while receiving 1.1 mg/m2 dose. - If occurrence of any event requiring permanent dose reduction while receiving 0.7 mg/m2: discontinue eribulin. - Diluent: Administer undiluted or dilute in 100 mL of 0.9% NaCl. Store undiluted in syringe or diluted eribulin for up to 4 hr at room temperature or for up to 24 hr under refrigeration. Discard unused portion of vial. - Rate: Infuse over 2-5 minutes on Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. - Y-Site Incompatibility: Do not dilute in or administer through an IV line containing solutions with dextrose or other medications. Patient/Family Teaching - Advise patient to notify health care professional if fever of 100.5\u00b0 F or other signs or symptoms of infection (chills, cough, burning or pain on urination) occur. - Advise female patient to use effective contraception during therapy and to notify health care professional immediately if pregnancy is planned or suspected or if breast feeding. - Instruct patient to notify health care professional of all Rx or OTC medications, vitamins, or herbal products being taken and consult health care professional before taking any new medications. - Advise patient not to receive vaccinations without consulting health care professional.
