[Dr. Bennett presents the second paper from the N3C:](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.12.21249511v3) This multi-center dataset supports robust evidence-based development of predictive and diagnostic tools and informs critical care and policy. Using machine learning (ML) to predict clinical severity and risk factors over time to create a foundation for ML models for generalizable clinical decision support tools. [The N3C Data Enclave has released its public dashboard. ](https://covid.cd2h.org/)It is a secure platform through which the harmonized clinical data provided by our contributing members is stored. N3C invites you to begin your journey with the Enclave and join the collaborative efforts of our partners to better understand and address the most pressing COVID-19 clinical questions. Help make science go faster and save lives. [First paper published from Data in the National COVID Cohort Collaborative- ](https://news.cuanschutz.edu/news-stories/cu-anschutz-physician-publishes-first-paper-from-data-in-the-national-covid-cohort-collaborative)N3C Data Enclave is a cloud-based data and computing environment designed to facilitate virtual access to clinical data provided by hospitals nationwide. Tell Bennett, MD, associate professor of pediatrics and informatics director for the Colorado Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, is a co-lead of the clinical scenarios and analytics team of the [National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C)](https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C). The collaborative is an initiative of the National Institutes of Health that is focused on analyzing patient-level data from many clinical centers to reveal patterns in COVID-19 patients. N3C will contain data from hospitals across the country, providing the largest database of COVID-19 affected patients in the nation. Our campus clinical sites, UCHealth and Children's Hospital Colorado, are included. CU has signed a data use agreement with the N3C that will ensure CCTSI researchers may access the data with relative ease. N3C has a [support desk website](https://covid.cd2h.org/help_desk) and is offering office hours on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 10 a.m.-11 a.m. Mountain Time. For questions about our campus "}
