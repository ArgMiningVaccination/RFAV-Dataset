Vaccine detoxification is important for people who have been vaccinated due to the toxicity inherent in vaccines, along with the volatility of heavy metals and other inorganic compounds. Some of us may have a stronger reaction to a vaccine than others, depending on allergies, how high the inflammation is and how heavy the toxic load is. One person may have a totally different reaction than the other, but it may be the same trigger, the vaccine. Many people are even allergic to components of vaccines, such as eggs and metals, and this causes even more trauma to the body. Everyone's body must detoxify all the time, but some of us have a harder time based on our toxic load or inflammation. Toxins accumulate when the body's detoxification mechanisms cannot keep up with cellular waste or the absorption of toxins from the intestine. Basically, this means that garbage arrives faster than your body can process it and safely remove it from the body. Vaccines include ingredients that do not belong to the body and are toxins that the body needs to remove. These toxins accumulate in the liver and its organs, further impairing the body's function and detoxification process. This affects your body's ability to function, leading to more serious illnesses. What are some of those toxins? It all depends on the vaccine, so be sure to read the insert. Someone has to read it, and since it is being injected into your body, it should be you. These ingredients can be found on the [CDC website.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htm) (3) Aluminum Egg protein Formaldehyde Monosodium glutamate Thimerosal Vaccine detox: 8 things you need to know - For everyone, we would start testing to see what your body needs and how it works. If someone has a reaction, we need to find out where the inflammation comes from. The only way to know is to test. It will be necessary to detoxify the body, but if done too early, these toxins can really make you sick. That's why we carry out the tests to find out where your body is and how you can prepare it for a detox. Once done, we would do everything to support the detoxification process and these liver pathways. Remove toxic foods and other chemical toxins - Your body cannot heal itself if it is bombarded with other toxins. First remove all chemicals in your daily life. Exchange your personal products, kitchen utensils, cleaning products, detergents and other commonly used items for cleaner versions. It is also time to detox your diet. We recommend a 30-day detox to improve your diet and redefine your body. Foods that contribute to the toxic load are removed to relieve the body, so it can focus on cleaning heavy metals / toxins. We always recommend that you pay special attention to organic and GMO-free products, especially during this period. Add fats to your diet - As heavy metals are attracted to fat, we add a fat like fish oil to get them out of the body. If we don't get them out of the body, they will remain in your body, fat or brain. Add good healthy fats to your diet to help your body detoxify. Don't worry, fats don't get fat. Your body needs fat. Supplements to support detoxification - Based on the patient's individual tests and allergies, we recommend supplements that support the patient's individual body. We would use supplements to support the detoxification process, create glutathione and others that are tailored to the patient and maximize their detoxification pathways. - There are also supplements and foods that bind to metals in the body. Activated charcoal, chlorella, coriander, garlic and other binders help to pick up these heavy metals and bring them with you when you leave the body. Chiropractic is more than a fit - Don't skip your chiropractic appointments during detox. Chiropractors make sure that your nervous system works and your body works. Your nervous system is the signaling system that tells your body what to do. This includes the important organs that support the vaccine detoxification process. Adjustment is another way to reduce inflammation that can inhibit the detoxification process. Massage bath, sauna, light exercise and detox - You want to keep your blood moving during the vaccine detox. Techniques like massage, sauna, light exercise and a detox bath can support your body during detox. Massage transports toxins from your muscles and tissues to the lymphatic system. Light exercise moves the body, but think of easy walks and easier exercises. Epsom salt baths help remove these toxins from the body. The sauna increases your heart rate and sweating is a way to remove toxins from your body. - Smoothies can be incredibly useful to detox your body, keep you healthy and help lose weight safely. A detox smoothie is like drinking a liquid vitamin! Smoothies are carefully selected to flood your body with nutrients without using special powders or expensive supplements. Instead, you just need some fruits and vegetables. A program that has been especially effective for me and helped me detox my bodie from vaccines and lose weight, was the [Smoothie Detox Challenge,](https://bit.ly/detoxyourbodywithsmoothies)I do know that this may sound like a promotion but honestly I would feel guilty if didn't talk about it.
