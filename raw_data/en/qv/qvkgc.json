She specializes in Pain Management, Sports Medicine, Anti-Aging, and of course, Stress Management. She is teaming up with [Rebel Med NW ](https://rebelmednw.com/about/)to expand her services to the Ballard community with her integrative approach to acupuncture and massage. Khai takes a multidisciplinary approach to building a personalized and effective treatment for each of her patients. She uses a combination of TCM acupuncture, injection therapy, bodywork therapies such as massage and cupping, lifestyle and diet counseling, and Chinese herbal medicine to help optimize the health of her clients. She has skillfully combined multiple techniques to create her own unique and effective modality. A great example of the evolution of acupuncture as a healing art. Khai grew up in the foothills of Mount St. Helens in Washington and got her Bachelor's degree in Environmental Science at Western Washington University's Huxley College. Going on to Bastyr University to achieve her Masters of Science in Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. Khai strives to keep learning and attends conferences and seminars regularly to stay absolutely current in her areas of specialty. Besides acupuncture and massage, she is also trained in injection therapy and medical microneedling. As a person with deep roots in action sports and the outdoors, Khai whole-heartedly understands the drive to function optimally on a physical and mental level. She believes that everyone deserves to live life to their fullest potential, in the best health they can maintain, as happily and actively as possible. In her free time, she enjoys snowboarding, downhill mountain biking, backpacking, and enjoying nature. This active lifestyle immediately informs her understanding of sports injuries, rehabilitation, and improving her patients' recovery time from injury. She gets it! Detailed Specialties When it comes to acute and chronic pain, a typical session with Khai involves acupuncture with electrical stimulation, cupping or other body work and injection therapy. She focuses on improving circulation, treating scar tissue, and kick starting your body's natural healing process. Acupuncture works with the body's Qi, or bio-electric energy and vital force. Electrical stimulation of acupuncture points works on a cellular level to initiate healing and give your cells ATP (energy) in order to initiate regeneration. Injection therapy is used with Procaine, which has the unique ability to breakdown scar tissue and realign the cellular matrix and by doing so reestablish electrical impulses and cellular communication. Your body then metabolizes the Procaine and uses it as a regenerative nutrient (Para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA). For treatment of stress or emotional imbalances, acupuncture can calm the nervous system and release negative energy from the body. One of the ways it can do this is by activating the parasympathetic nervous system response. Khai will also recommend lifestyle changes that will assist in normalizing your stress response. She puts an emphasis on letting negative emotions and stress pass through the body so we are not holding on to them. Stress is a normal part of our lives, it's when we hold it in our bodies for more than 30 minutes that it starts to impact our health negatively. It is common to somatamize our emotional trauma into physical symptoms. This is the very real mind-body connection. We actually now have evidence to show that we hold memories and emotions in the connective tissue of our bodies. Acupuncture has the ability to release these emotions so we can process them in a healthy way. Acupuncture, by nature, will always treat both the physical and emotional aspects of the person as a whole. Khai's approach to Anti-aging comes from a holistic view of the physical, emotional and environmental impacts on the body. As we age we lose our innate ability to regenerate, it is important to start your anti aging journey as soon as possible. It is much easier to prevent signs of aging than it is to reverse them. However, she is able to meet you wherever you are in your aging process and help set reasonable and achievable goals. Khai offers a variety of cosmetic and dermatology treatments as well as diet and lifestyle counseling specific to your needs. All of these treatments are based on stimulating collagen and elastin production, increasing circulation and reducing inflammation. These are regenerative techniques that utilize your own body's healing system. As opposed to botox and fillers, Khai uses an all natural and holistic approach. This is a great natural alternative to invasive surgeries, face lifts or toxic injection techniques that can have long term negative effects. I am text block. Click edit button to change this text. Cosmetic acupuncture is a subtle but effective way to prevent and treat signs of aging on the surface as well as addressing the body internally. Most commonly cosmetic acupuncture treats the face by lifting and plumping skin as well as targeting fine lines and blemishes. Any part of the body can be treated such as abdomen or stretch marks. Subtle changes can be seen after one treatment, but long lasting results usually take 6-10 treatments. There is no down time after a cosmetic acupuncture visit. Lymphatic stimulation using cups or a gua sha stone can assist in draining excess water retention and toxin accumulation. Facial cupping is a great addition for treating dark circles or puffiness around the eyes. Using a gua sha stone helps with muscle tone and shape for the jaw line, cheek bones and neck area. Khai can also teach you how to do lymphatic massage, cupping and gua sha at home so you can add these techniques to your daily routine. This can also be helpful for those suffering from headaches, jaw pain or sinus pain. Khai also offers intradermal facial injections. This is a similar technique to mesotherapy, where she injects all natural substances into the dermal layers to rejuvenate the skin. When administered by an acupuncturist, these injections enhance the effectiveness of acupuncture by stimulating acupuncture points for a longer period of time. They also bring nutrients into the area of the face that most need them, providing a regenerative healing process. Substances used include homeopathic injectables like placenta comp and collagen. These are mild and safe for the body, with no known negative side effects. Because acupuncture and bio-injections are regenerative, they can actually reverse the effects of botox. Botox paralyzes the muscles in the face in order to slow down aging, acupuncture increases collagen production and circulation, which can reverse the actions of Botox. Natural treatments generally work slower but last longer and are more in balance with the overall health of the body long term. Khai is trained and experienced in medical microneedling. She uses a high RPM (18,000) AcuMicro pen with 12 needle adjustable tip (up to 2.5 ml) and Chinese herbal serums as well as Vegan Apple Stem Cells. Microneedling increases keratinocytes and stem cells which produce collagen and elastin in the face. It's better at treating wrinkles, age spots, scars, skin tone, acne and other blemishes. A Medical micro-needling treatment includes facial massage, application of numbing cream and body acupuncture for relaxation and full body circulation. Generally results are seen with 3-4 treatments that require one day of down time (no makeup, sweating or sun and some redness). Each treatment must be done at least three weeks apart to allow for healing. However, cosmetic acupuncture or nano needling can be done in between to enhance results and speed up recovery. Nano-needling uses the same AcuMicro pen but utilizes a more gentle needle tip that does not penetrate into the dermal layers of the skin. There is no down time so this is a great treatment to do the same day before a social event or photo shoot. A step up from regular microneedling is the latest microneedling technology utilizing Radio Frequency (RF). This is a non-invasive and highly effective way to treat wrinkles, skin tone, texture, scars, acne and to remodel sagging skin and adipose tissue. Khai uses the [Potenza RF microneedling](https://rebelmednw.com/aesthetics/potenza-microneedling/) device that can treat all skin types, anywhere on the body. The Potenza microneedling treatment delivers focused radiofrequency (RF) technology to heat your skin. Using RF technology will trigger your body's natural response to create an increased level of collagen and elastin production, resulting in an enhanced skin revitalization treatment versus microneedling alone. RF energy produces a change in the electrical charges of the treated skin creating an electron movement. The resistance (impedance) of the tissue to that electron movement generates heat, resulting in soft tissue coagulation. A Potenza RF microneedling treatment involves an individualized treatment plan specific for your goals. Acupuncture for relaxation or a hydration IV is also provided during your treatment. There is one day of down time but redness usually only lasts for a few hours after the treatment. Khai also offers recommendations for your skin care routine to maximize and protect your results. As your natural collagen and elastin production is stimulated, you will continue to see results improve over the next 6 months. A full course of treatments consists of 3 - 5 sessions depending on your individual needs. Generally, one treatment for every decade of life is recommended.
