Levy Place, Box 1260 New York, NY 10029 -6574 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Q: Why isn't my immunization history sufficient for proof of immunity? A: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai adheres to the guidelines of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention for healthcare workers. Proof of immunity must be verified via blood titers for Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Varicella and Hepatitis B. Immunity for Tetanus and Pertussis are verifiable by a recent dose of Diphtheria Tetanus Acellular Pertussis (TDAP) vaccine received in the past 10 years. Q: If I need blood titers, why should I subm it my immunization history? A: Immunization dates are important in the event that your blood titers are negative. Each required titer has a specific number of doses needed to complete a series. For example, New York State requires the following: Either two doses of MMR, or two doses of Measles, one dose of Mumps and one dose of Rubella. If a titer is negative for any of the required immunizations, specific CDC guidelines are available for attempting to boost one's immunity. In most cases, an additional dose of the vaccine will be administered and the titer rechecked after 30 days, if it is not medically contraindicated. Q: If any of the Immunization titers are Negative, Equivocal or Inconclusive, what will I need to do? A: 1. Measles, Mumps and Rubella - An additional MMR vaccine booster will be required. 2. Varicella - An additional v aricella vaccine booster will be required. 3. Hepatitis B - Initiating the 3 dose series booster may be required. Q: What if I had the Varicella infection (chickenpox) as a child? A: In most cases, your titer will prove immunity if you had the infection in the past. Otherwise you will be required to complete a 2 dose series for Varicella. Q: I started the Hepatitis B series but never completed it. Do I need to start the s eries over? A: Generally, we don't restart the series. The most common approach would be to give the missing remaining doses in Student Health, wait 30 days and then get a Hepatitis B Surface Antibody drawn. Q: I had a PPD (TB skin test) last year. Do I need another one? A: A TB screening within 1 year of your enrollment date is required. A PPD/TB screening will then be required annually for all medical students. Q: What if I have had a positive PPD in the past? A: You must attach a copy of a chest x -ray report dated within 1 year of your enrollment with your immunization record. Please note that receiving the BCG vaccine does not always present a positive reaction. Therefore, a chest x- ray is required for positive PPD reaction (greater than 10mm). Q: Why does the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai require so much proof of immunization? A: All medical colleges require the same. It is our intent to maintain healthcare and provide knowledge of communicable diseases within the profession you have chosen. It is important in healthcare to KNOW YOUR STATUS.
