There are many ways to support IBS and the best way will look different for everyone based on their personal situation. I feel that a often over-looked, yet highly impactful, factor is HOW you are eating. Are you scarfing your food down? Eating in a distracted way? Not paying attention to hunger and satiety cues. These are harder to tackle than a simple diet switch but when practiced regularly, they can lay a beautiful foundation to find long-term relief. Some simple strategies to begin to incorporate: -pause for a few deep/slow breaths before eating -put away the distractions (phone, TV, reading material...) -put your fork down between bites and savor the flavors -pay attention to the flavors, textures -take note of how your stomach feels as it begins to fill with food. These are just for starters. Choose 1 or 2 that land for you and begin to practice. It takes time but again, it is a necessary foundation to build in order to find long term success. "}
