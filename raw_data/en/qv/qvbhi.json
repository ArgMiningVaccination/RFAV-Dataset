The USFA is located at the National Emergency Training Center (NETC) in Emmitsburg, Maryland, and includes the National Fi re Academy (NFA), National Fire Data Center (NFDC), National Fire Programs (NFP), and the National Preparedness Network (PREPnet). The USFA also provides oversight and management of the Noble Training Center in Anniston, Alabama. The mission of the USFA is to save lives and reduce economic losses due to fire and related emergencies through training, research, data collection and analysis, public education, and coordination with other Federal agencies and fire protection and emergency service personnel. The USFA's National Fire Academy offers a diverse course delivery system, combining resident courses, off-campus deliveries in cooperation with State training organizations, weekend instruction, and online courses. The USFA maintains a blended learning approach to its course selections and course development. Resident courses are delivered at bo th the Emmitsburg campus and its Noble facility. Off- campus courses are delivered in cooperation with State and local fire training organizations to ensure this Nation's firefighters are prepared for the hazards they face. This course is designed to give the first responder at a hazardous materials incident basic concepts and techniques for appropriate be havior before, during, and after the inci dent. The course will define hazardous materials, and will describe roles, responsibilities, and risks associated with the incident. Additionally, the course will discuss the limitations of, and identify re sources appropriate to, emergency and nonemergency situations.

INTRODUCTION SM 1-2 INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION Hazardous mater ials incidents are not the sam e as fire suppression or other \"normal\" em ergency operations. The nature of the hazard requires different protective equipm ent, ope rational approaches, skills, and attitudes. F or you to re spond safely to a hazardou s materials incident, you have to be trained and prepared m entally. What you don't know can kill you. A hazardous m aterial (i. e., haz m at) is any sub stance (e.g., solid, liquid, or gas) capable of causing harm to peop le, property, and the environm ent. A haz m at incident involves the actual or potential rele ase of hazardous materials. As in m ost em ergencies , local government is the first line of defense against haz m at incidents. Local governm ent is responsible for planning and developing an em ergency m anagem ent system that is capable of effective and tim ely response in a haz mat em ergency. Although other levels of governm ent--Sta te and Federal--m ay be called in to help, on ly local gov ernment can f ulfill this c ritical role. The prim ary resource available to local governm ent to defend against hazardous m aterials em ergencies is well-trained and motivated first responders. The first responder is the individ ual who ar rives first on the scene of a haz mat incident with the responsibility to act . For our purposes, first responders are em ergenc y response personnel, not m embers of the public, who m ay arrive on the scene first. This includes fire service, law enforcem ent, Em ergency Medical Services (EMS), pub lic works, a nd industry personnel. THE ROLE OF THE FIRST RE SPONDER The role of hazardou s materials first responders is lim ited because, by definition, they are trained to func tion prim arily in a defensive mode. Their f oremost goa ls are to act saf ely, lim it potential exp osure to a ll persons, and provide tim ely inform ation to the prope r autho rities. Additional training is required for more aggressive actions. The first responder' s responsibilitie s can be defined under the following four general categories. Recognition and Identification recognize th e presen ce of hazardous m aterials; identify the m aterial, possible; and gather inform ation. SM rities; call for assis tance; and provide updates. Isolation set per imeters/zone s; deny entry; and evacuate. Protection initiate the Incident Command System (ICS); protect responde rs/public; initiate decontam ination; and only (no intentional contact).

NOTES: SM 1-11 INTRODUCTION INTIAL RE SPONS E TO HAZARDS M ATERIALS INCIDENTS: BASIC CONCE PTS PROGRAM OVERVIEW Training for first responders is mandated by Federal regulation-- Occupational Safety and Health Ad ministration (OSHA) 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.120 and Environm ental Protection Agency (EP A) 40 CFR 311. (Excerpts from these regulations can be found in the Appendix of this m anual.) The National F ire Academy (NFA) has developed two integrat ed field courses that provide progressively indepth training to help potential responders meet or exceed levels of knowledge and com petency specified in OSHA/EPA regulations and National Fire Protection A ssociation (NFPA) standard s: Basic Concepts ; and Concept Implementatio n. Course I: Basic Con cepts In general, basic concepts and tech niques related to hazardous m aterials first response are covered in Course I. Instruction is designed to prepare first respon ders to ens ure persona l saf ety an d to initiate appropriate actions. In addition, the course contains basic materials that m ay be of use or in terest to techn icians, specialist s, Incid ent Commanders (IC' s), special employees, and trainers. No prior comprehensive hazardo us materials knowledge is assum ed. Course II: Concept Implementation Inform ation presented in the first 2-da y course is reinforced and expanded upon in Course II through general applic ation in an operational context. More detail and new c oncepts are provided on procedures, usage, and related considerations, f ollowing th e basic chronology of a hazardous materials in cident. It is recomm ended that students have taken NFA's Incident Command System (ICS) course or equiva lent training prior to taking this course. Goals for Course I: Basic Con cepts Goals for th e Initial Response to Hazardous Materials Incidents: Basic Concepts course, which are derived from applicable Federal regulations, have been id entified a s follows: SM 1-12 INTRODUCTION Define hazardous m aterials and de scrib e associated risks to personal safety.

It describes Federal regulations that apply to the use and disposal of hazardous chem icals, as well as governm ent responsibilities in hazardous m aterials in cidents. The unit also discusses levels of traini ng for first responders in hazardous materials incidents and the concept of Standard of Care. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND Chemicals in Society Society has studied and used chem icals in various form s for thousands of years. Docum ented evidence ex ists of the ancien t Greeks nam ing, studying, and finding uses for m any diffe rent chem icals available in their time. As the hum an race progresse d in knowledge and technology, so did our knowledge and use of che micals. Early Efforts By the tim e we reach ed the Dark Ages, our curiosity and desire to manipulate nature led to the beginnings of modern chem istry. The nobility of the tim e was looking for ne w ways to acquire w ealth. To that end, a specialized group, the alchem ists, arose. They had one prim ary goal--the creation of gold from base materials, (lead, iron, copper, etc.). The work of early alch emists was most definitely a hit-or-m iss affair. They understood little if anything about what they were doing. There are accounts of extrem ely violent and ev en lethal ex perim ents taking place. It is saf e to say that as the se tinke rers tried different chem ical concoctions, the poten tial existed for very rap id turnover in the position. Over tim e, the alchem ists becam e more and m ore m ethodical and scien tific in their ap proach, an d they m ade trem endous strides in understanding the world around them. Th e alchem ists and their trial-and- error investigations evolved into chem istry. In 1869, the Russian chem ist, D.I. Mendeleev (1834-1907) established the principle of periodicity. As his work continued, Mendeleev developed the first periodic table of elem ents, the fo rerunner of today' s periodic chart. So accurate was his principle that Me ndeleev predicted the exis tence of several elem ents not proved to exis t until much later. Mendele ev's contribution to m chem SM 2-3 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS Chemical Revolution Today we have reached a point of de velopm ent that would have astounded Mendeleev. As of 2003, approxim ately 24.5 m illion d ifferent com pounds were reg istered with the Chem ical Abstract Service (CAS) of Colum bus, Ohio. In 1988 alone, CAS added over 600,000 substances to its files, an average of 60,000 per month . Over the 22-year period, from 1981 to 2003, an average of over 720,000 substances have been added annually to the CAS listing. This is not to say that all of these compounds are hazardous o r found in comm ercial production, but rath er that th ey have been deve loped. Many, if not m ost, will som e day f ind th eir way into production. To understand m ore fully the phenom enal growth in the num ber of synthetic substances, let' s exa mine so me figures. In 1965 (the first year that such inf ormation was availabl e), CAS listed 211,934 substances in its files. At the end of 2002, the number had increased to 2,500,000. The estim ated to tal for 1989 was appro ximately 10 m illion su bstances. In essence, we find that the num ber of com pounds listed with the CAS has increased o ver 114 fold in only 38 years. It is im portant to keep sight of one simple factor in this discussion. Simply stated, our problem s with hazar dous m aterials have not been with us for very long. As we created m ore and m ore chem icals, we increased the magnitude and altered the nature of the problem that we face. CLAS SIFICATION S YSTEMS F OR CHEMICALS Different system s have been develope d for classifying this overwhelm ing number of c ompounds and m ixtures of chemicals. These system s evolved over the past 15 to 20 year s, as ou r experien ce with chem icals grew. Mo st of the commonly us ed classifica tion system s were developed by governm ent regulatory agencies, such as the U. S. Departm ent of Transportation (DOT), the Environm ental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Departm ent of Labor' s Occupationa l Saf ety and Health Adm inistration (OSHA). Each of these regulato ry agencies addresses a different set of problem s. As a result, there are m ajor differences in how com pounds are classified, depending upon who does the classification. Th is situation can lead to confusion and m isinterpreta tion. So, let' s take a m oment to exam ine som e of the different term s that m ay be encountered. SM 2-4 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS Hazardous Materia ls term \"hazardous m aterials\" wa s first d efined by DOT in 1975. Hazardous m aterials are defined and re gulated in the Co de of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 49, Part s 100 to 180 (49 CFR 100-180). The specific definition for hazardous m aterials is found in Section 171 .8, which states that a hazardous m aterial is \"a substance or material which has been determ ined by the Secreta ry of Transportation to be capable of posing an unreasonable ri sk to health, saf ety, and property when transported...\" A specific listing of hazardous m aterials is found in 49 CFR 172.101 and its appendices. Remember, i n this defi nition, the term \"haz ardous mater ials\" refer s to materia ls being transported. Hazardous Substances The term \"hazardous substances\" is defined b y EPA, DOT, and OSHA and in related Federal legislation, including the Comprehensive Emergency Response, Compensation, and Liability Ac t (CERC LA) o f 1980. By OSHA' s definition, a hazardous substance is \"any m aterial that can produ ce an advers e effect on the health or safe ty of the person exposed.\" Included in this definiti on are materials listed in section 101(14) and 101(33) of CERCLA and h azardou s materials as listed in 49 CFR 172.101 and appendices. Hazardous Waste The term \"hazardous waste\" is defin ed by EPA and DOT and regulated in 40 CFR, se ction 261 et al. In essen ce, a hazardous waste is any waste material that is ign itable, corros ive, reactive, or \"toxic\" and \"which m ay pose a substantial or potential hazard to hum an health and safety and to the environm ent when im properly m anaged.\" Basically, this m eans that hazardous waste has the ability to cause dam age to liv ing org anism s and/or the environm ent. One of the prim ary differences between hazardo us wastes, substances, and materials is the intended usage of the m aterial. If the material is intended to be used in production, m anufactur ing, and so on, it is a hazardous material or substance. However, if it is inten ded for disposal, it is a hazardous waste. Consider gasoline. When gasoline is used as a fuel and is in its in tended container, it is a hazardous m aterial. However, if the same gasoline is spilled or has le aked into the gr ound, it is now a hazardous w aste, because it is no lon ger intended for use. SM 2-5 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS Extremel y Hazardous Substances The term \"extrem ely hazardous sub stances, \" as the nam e implies, refers to products that have an extrem ely high degree of toxicity. The EPA estab lished a system to identif y thes e materials. The list ha s included a s many as 403 che micals, but now totals about 360. Due to the high degree of toxicity involved, facilities ar e mandated to repor t the presence of specified q uantities of these chem icals to local, State, and Federal authorities. The purpose of this re porting is to help State and local officials identify locations requiring immediate atten tion for respon se planning. If you find this series of definitions confusing, you are not alone. It is not necessary to know the specific d efinition of each of these types of chem icals. Rather you need to understand the following: There are different term s used t o classify various che micals depending upon their intended use, type of hazard, and degree of hazard. When we use the term \"hazardous mate rials\" in this cou rse, we are generically referring to any chem ical that f alls in to one o r more of the four categories. For the purposes of this course, hazardous m aterials (haz m at) are defined as any chem ical that, if improperly handled, is capable of harm ing people, anim als, plants, or the environm ent. STANDARD OF CARE It is im portant that you understand the basic concept of Standard of Care (SOC) and, specifically, what is invol ved. This section will provide you with a better understanding of the following: what is m eant by the term \"Standard of Care\"; what specific laws, regulations, standards, and guidance m ake up the Standard of Care; and how the Standard of Care affects th e way respo nse agencies and personnel m ust operate. SM 2-6 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS What is the Standard of Care? Suppose som e morning you wake up and ju st don' t feel quite right. You feel sick enough that you decide to call your fam ily doctor for an appointm ent, only to find he/she is on vacation. You a re referred to another doctor. W hen you arrive at the other doctor' s office, you explain your sym ptoms and the doctor proceed s to give you a very quick, rough exam ination. Upon completing the ex amination, the doctor states that obviously you are suffering from a viral infection. He/She goes on to state that the on ly ef fective way to treat this virus is to run arou nd an oak tree three tim es and then p lace ice on y our ear s. Y ou are told to repeat this practice three tim es a day. At that point you say, \"Thank you, no,\" and immediately leave the office. Why would you leave the office and not follow the doctor' s advice? You would leave because yo u expect a cert ain level of perfor mance when y ou go to see a doctor, and you know that the prescribed rem edy is not standard tre atment. This particu lar doctor is obviously not providing the level of perform ance nor displaying the com petence expected by or fro m the m edical profession. This little story addresses the primar y concepts involved in Standard of Care. In general, Standard of Care is the level of competen cy anticipated or mandated in the per formance of a service or duty . Thi s definition provides on ly part of the a nswer. Def ining Standa rd of Care is straightforward, but fully understanding what it im plies is som ething more elusiv e. Components of the Standard of Care First , how do you define \"com petency? \" Competency involves m any factors. \"A ccepted p ractices\" foun d within a profession, trade, etc., are one factor. Such accepted practices are often reflected in profession al, industrial, or governm ental standards and licensing requirem ents. Another factor includ es moral, ethical, and p olitical issue s. Norm ally, these f actors involve legislative requirem ents set fo rth in laws or ordinances. A fina l factor includ es the cou rt's interpretations and opinions. Second , it is vital that you understand that the Standard of Care for any given situation or profession is not static but dynam ic--in other words, changing. The change in Standard of Care usually is due to a change in what is deem ed \"competent.\" As our knowledge and understanding change and expand regarding a specific problem or situation, so does competence. On the other hand, we m ay also find that our m oral or ethical beliefs change. And w e may find ch anges in how the judicial system interprets, defines, or ets exam ple of knowledge-based change involves the use of aspirin for the reduction of fever. As recently as th e past 15 to 20 years, th e Standard of Care stated that children suffering from fever should routinely receive aspirin. However, the m edical profession found a high correlation between the use of aspirin and a potentially fatal neurological complication known as Reye' s syndrom e. As a result of this new inform ation, the Standard of Care has been m odified drastically. Now, children with fever should not receive aspirin, but, rather, may be treated with a nonaspirin pain reliever. An exam ple of a m oral or ethical-b ased change in the Standard of Care involves punishm ent for theft. In the old days, a thief may have been hanged for stealing a horse. This puni shment would not be allowed today, at least no t in this coun try. Finally, the courts can c hange the Standard of Care sim ply by m aking a ruling on a specific cas e. An example of a court-m andated change in the Standard of Care involves an individua l's right to rem ain silent. Before the Miranda decision, police were not required to infor m persons of their rights. However, after Miranda, police not only have to read a suspect his or her rights, they also have to make sure that the in dividua l fully understands those rights. Hazardous Materia ls Standard of Care Unfortunately, the chem ical revolutio n went relatively unnoticed by m ost people outside of the chem ical and rela ted industries. The public was left wondering what was going on. How big and bad is this problem ? Who do we believe: those who say there is no problem or those who say we are on the verg e of a catastroph e? The incident at Bhopal, India, in 1984 brought the potential for disaster into clear focus. The release of m ethyl isocyanate (MIC) led to between 3,000 and 5,000 deaths and possibl y as m any as 200,000 to 300,000 long- term health impacts. This one in cident, probably m ore than any other single event, points out that we live in a world that has the potential for major chem ical disasters. There were m any other incidents prior to Bhopal that spurred a change i n national policy and directly affected emergency responders. For exam ple, in the late 1960' s and into the 1970' s, a large num ber of rail incidents occurred that involved li quefied petroleum gas (L PG) and fire. Very often, the re sult of such situa tions w as a Boiling Liquid Vapor Explosion (BLEVE). SM 2-8 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS As the causes of these BLEVE' s were identified, steps were taken to prevent f uture occu rrences. This process inv olved railcars with th ermal protection, head-shields, and shelf-couplers. As a result, the number of de railm ents involving BLEVE' s has dram atically decreased. In 1968, an oil tanker, the Torrey Canyon , ran aground of f the shore of England. A pproxim ately 36,000,000 gallons of crude oil were lost from the ves sel. (Note: The Exxon Valdez only lost about 11,000,000 gallons.) This m assive oil spill and environm ental nightm are caused of ficials in the United Sta tes to question our ability to handle suc h a cata strophic re lease. As a result of this histo ry of chem ical emergencies, it becam e evident that something had to be done. In 1968, after the Torrey Canyon incident, the governm ent started to take steps to develop a system atic methodology or standard for response to chem ical incidents. The system that developed can be referred to as the \"Standard of Care\" for em ergency response to hazardous m aterials incidents. With the events that occurred in the late 1990' s and i n 2001 with Oklahom a City, The World Trade Cent er, and Pentagon it has becom e painfully ob vious th at Standard of Care has beco me a dynamic en tity and brought this concept to a global level. Legal Implications of the Standard of Care The existence of a haz ardous m aterial s Standard of Care has potential legal im plications for em ergency response agencies and employees. One of the prim ary im plications is liabilit y. W ebster defines liability as, \"the state of being liable.\" Being liable means that som e individual, group, or agency is legally bound or responsible to perform or provide a function, duty, or service. The Standard of Care establishe s duties and respons ibilities. But assigning responsibility does not necessarily im ply liab ility. The pri mary concern with regard to liability is ne gligenc e. Negligenc e is the f ailure to perform one's duty or responsibility with reasonable regard for foreseeable harm to another. Gross negligence is the willf ul or, in som e cases, alm ost willful failu re to perform one's duty or respons ibility. In order to establish negligence, a party m ust prove that: A duty or responsibility was owed. SM 2-9 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS There was a f ailure to perf orm that duty within the rea lm of a Standard of Care. Damage occurred. The failure to perform the duty or responsibility resulted in the damage. In most negligence laws uits, th ere are only four avenues of defense. 1. The defendant m ay try to prove that no duty or responsibility exists. Obviously, this would be difficult if the suit revolved around one or m ore of the respon sibilities identif ied in existing laws, regulations, and standards. 2. The defendant m ay try to prove th at no Standard of Care exists. Again, this could be very difficu lt to prov e in light o f these docum ents. 3. The defendant m ay try to prove that the Standard of Care was not viola ted. Th is def ense will n eed to s ubstantiate these claim s. 4. The defendant m ay try to prove no injury o ccurred or that injury did not result from a violation of the Standard of Care or was not foreseeable. There are f ew case law preceden ts in th e area of hazard ous m aterials. Most legal actions have not invol ved governm ental agencies as the plaintiffs (other than chem ical re porting noncom pliance). Rather, private citizens, public interest groups, and othe rs at the local le vel have initiated most of the action s. This trend m ost like ly will c ontinue. As time passes , employees will probab ly constitu te a m ajor gro up of plaintif fs. It would be a m istake for anyone to think that the prim ary liability concern is with Federal or S tate governm ent. The great est potential liability exposure is definitely at the loc al level. It is im portant to understand that, not only must respon se agencies or organizations m eet the S tandard of Care , so m ust the first responder. Your actions during an em ergency m ust be in line with the Standa rd Opera ting Procedures (SOP' s) dev eloped for hazardous m aterials response. T he SOP' s must be developed in conform ity with the requ irements of the regula tions and standa rds. If this is not the c ase, a potentia l liability exis ts not only for the agency, but for the responder as w ell. Hazardous m aterials response indeed is dangerous and difficult. That is precisely why the Standard of Care has developed. SM 2-10 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS Standard of Care Ma trix As we have said, the past 20 to 25 year s have led to a trem endous increase in our knowledge about hazardous m aterials an d related problem s. As a result, we have seen the growth and developm ent of num erous laws , regulations, and standards specifically aim ed at m eeting the challeng es faced by em ergency responders. In e ssence, the laws, regulations, and standard s come together to form the fram ework for the Standard of Care by which y ou will be judged. They are summarized in a m atrix on the next page and discussed in the following sections. SM Resp onde r Health and Safety Right-To W ater Act CERCLA (Superfund) SARA HMTUSA Federal Regulations EPA 40 CFR 30 0 OSHA 29 CFR 19 10. 120 EPA 40 CFR 311 DOT to iations: Clean Water Act--Federal Water Polluti on Con trol 1970 and Amendments CERCLA--Comprehensive Env ironmental R esponse, Compensati on, and Liability Act of 1980 SARA--Superfu nd Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 HMTUSA-- Hazardous Mater ials Transport ation Uniform Safet y Act 1990 EPA 40 CFR 30 0--The N ational Oil and Hazardo us Substance Co ntingen cy Plan OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120/EPA 4 0 CFR 311--Hazardous Wa ste O perations and Emergency Response NFPA 471-- Recommended Practice for Responding to Hazardous ents NFPA 472-- Standard for Profess Hazardous Materials In ciden ts NFPA 473-- Standard for Competencies for EMS Personnel Responding to Hazardous Materials In ciden ts NRT-1--Hazard ous Materials Emergenc y ND STANDARDS FEDERAL LEGISLATION Federal Water Pollution Control Act (The Clean Water Act) of 1970 and Amendments In 1970, a law comm only referred to as the Clean W ater Act (CWA) was passed. T he CW A (and its subsequent am endm ents) m andated the estab lishm ent of a National Respo nse System (NRS) prim arily f or the managem ent of oil spills in navigab le waters an d their tribu taries. This legislation required the Fe deral governm ent to deve lop \"a coordinated and effective action\" to minim ize th e dam ages resulting from oil and hazardous substance releases. Additionally, CW A established the National Response Team (NRT) , tasked to im plem ent the Federal r esponse to such emergencie s. The NRT is com prised of representatives of various Federal agencies with m ajor environm ental, transportation, em ergency m anagem ent, worker safety, and public health responsibilities. The NRT is responsible for developing and maintaining the Nation al Continge ncy Plan (NCP). The NRT does not respond to the incident. It is a coordination team and usually works out of W ashington, DC. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liabilit y Act of 1980 In 1980, the Com prehensive Environm ental Response, Com pensation, and Liability Ac t (CERCLA), was pass ed. Most people a re familiar with CERCLA because it started the o riginal Superfund for the cleanup o f hazardous w aste dum p sites around the country. CERCLA al so m andated changes to the NCP and extended the lia bility of the spiller to cover the costs of the cleanup. In general, the act broadened the scope and scale of Federal inv olvem ent in hazardous m aterials situations. However, the prim ary focus was still hazardous waste dumps and oil spills in nav igable waters. Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 In 1986, the Superfund Am endments a nd Reauthorization Act (SARA), was passed. As the na me im plies, SARA acted to a mend and reauthorize CERCLA. Again, a m ajor focus was on hazardo us waste site cleanup, bu t this a ct added many requirem ents that never ex isted before. In essence, SARA established a national baseline with regard to planning, response, manage ment, and training for chem ical em ergencies. SM 2-15 REGUL ATIONS A Title I r equires OSHA to estab lish train ing req uirements f or hazardous waste and em ergency respons e personnel (Sec. 126). Title III of SARA mandates the estab lishm ent of State and local planning groups specifically to rev iew or develop hazardous m aterials response plan s. Title III also requires that th e NRT develop gu idance docu ments to ass ist in the p reparation and implem entation of e mergency plans. As part of the planning process, facilit ies th at ha ve specif ied quantities o f specific hazardous substances m ust provide certain inform ation, including inventories or Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) to local and State planning groups and the local fire depart ment. If sufficient quantities of these m aterials ex ist, the facility also must identif y a con tact person f or the State and lo cal p lanning groups. Add itionally, the facili ties and p lannin g groups are required to provide inform ation regarding inventories or lists of chem icals to the m edical comm unity, citizen groups, or individual members of the public. SARA m andates that States establish a m echanism through the State Emergency Response Comm ission (SERC) to ensure that planning and training tak e place and to provide assis tance to local gov ernm ents. The SERC is responsible for developing a nd m aintaining the State' s response plan. As part of the plan, States ge nerally provide an im portant source of technical specialists, infor mation, and coordination. H owever, they typically provide only m inimal operationa l support to local jurisdictions in the form of equipm ent, m aterials, or personnel. Local governm ent is assigned a role in planning and training through the Local Em ergency Planning Comm ittee (LEPC). The LEPC is responsible for developing the local response syst em and capabilities. A pri mary focus is the identification, coordina tion, and effective managem ent of local resou rces. Hazardous Materia ls Transportation Uniform Safety Act Origina lly HMTUSA, but now sim ply referred to as HMT A, this p iece of legis lation integra United materials shipping requirem ents. It e nhanced the nine-dig it hazard class system with divisions and packing groups. It added m ore and different placa rding and packag ing catego ries as well as additio nal lic ensin g requirem ents. It required addition al planning to be developed, and provided a m echanis m for the funding of training programs. Finally it requir ed the crea tion of Nationa l Curricu lum SM 2-16 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS FEDE RAL REGULATIONS Federal or State regulations also play a m ajor ro le in es tablishing the Standard of Care. This portion of th e text add resses the sp ecific Federal regulations that apply to hazardou s materials planning, p revention, or response. However, before we go on, it is im portant to understand exactly what Federal regulations are a nd the role that they play. Regulation s are mandatory standards . They are autho rized by specific legislation (laws) and are writte n by the responsible agencies or departm ents. Although regulations are not law s, they carry the same weight as law s due to the legislative author izatio n for their d evelopm ent. Federal regulations are printed by th e governm ent and ar e available for purchase. The regulations are bro ken into 50 \"Titles \" and published in books called the \" Code of Federal Regulations \" (CFR). Changes , additions, or deletions in the CFR ar e published on an alm ost-daily basis in a docum ent known as the Federal Register . Environmental Protection Agency 40 CF R Part 300--The National Oil and Hazardous Substance Contingency Plan As previously m entioned, the NCP deals with the NRS and how it functions. In today' s system , regul ations underlying the NCP are found in the EPA 40 CFR Part 300. The NRS is a tiered system . At the t op is the NRT, which was previou sly discussed. At the next level is th e Regional Response Team (RRT), which coordinates Federal and State agencies in each of 13 region s. The RRT becom es involved in large incidents and actually m ay respond to the scene. The Federal Onscene Coordinator (OSC) also is found at this level. The OSC is a predesignated m ember of EPA or the Coast Guard (depending on the location of the em ergency). T his pers on has the au thority to br ing Federal resources to bear on the in cident. T he OSC m ay or m ay not respond to the actual incident site. SM 2-17 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS Occupational Safet y and Health Administration 29 CFR Part 1910.120, Environmental Protection Agency 40 CF R Part 311-- Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response OSHA 1910.120 and EPA 311 are iden tical regulations m andated by SARA. The reason both OSHA and EPA prom ulgated these regulations is that OSHA regulations apply only in States with their own OSHA agencies, while EPA regulations would a pply to all other S tates. In short, these regulations apply to everyone , whether you are in an OSHA State or not. Many of the provisions in these regula tions apply specifically to hazardous waste site operations. However, th e final portion addresses em ergency response. These regulations includ e som e very im portant concepts, includ ing th e def inition of an em ergency re sponse, the or ganiza tion of work groups using the \"buddy system ,\" what constitutes a hazardous materials response team, what is included in the term \"hazardous substance, \" health h azards considerations, and so on. The regulations m andate m edical monitoring and annual physicals for specific response personnel. Requi rements for the developm ent of specific em ergency response plans for response agencies are exam ined. A type of response m anagem ent system, known a s the Incident Command System (ICS), also is m andated. (The IC S will be d iscussed in Unit 6: Site Managem ent and Sc ene Setup.) At the center of the ICS is the us e of an overall commander known as the Incident Commander (IC). The I C is responsible for coordinating and contro lling all onsc ene r espon se ac tivities and op erations. A know ledgeable Safety Officer also must be assigned to identify and evaluate hazards and to ensure the safe conduct of the operation. T he regulations also address requirem ents for protective clothing and operational procedures, as well as em ergency m edical support. Finally, the regulations address the need fo r com petency-bas ed training for personnel. With regard to the training requirem ents, all responders m ust receive minimum levels of training, depending upon the roles and functions they will f ill and perf orm. There a re five basic levels of training: SM 2-18 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS 1. First responder at the awareness level. 2. First responder at th e operations level. 3. Hazardous materials technician. 4. Hazardous materials specialist. 5. Onscene Incident Commander. First Responder at the Awareness Level First respon ders at the awareness leve l are individuals who are likely to witness or d iscover the release of a hazardous substance. Their prim ary functions are to notify prope r authorities that a rel ease has occurred, and to initiate an appropriate response. They also m ay establish isolation areas. This category of responder includes all police officers and m ay include emergency m edical personnel as well as private sector em ployees. First Responder at the Operations Level First responders at the operations leve l are part of the in itial response to a hazardous substance release for th e pur pose of p rotecting p eople, property, and the environm ent. They function prim arily in a defensive mode, without actually trying to stop the releas e. Their function is to contain the release (keep it from spreading ) from a safe distan ce an d to preven t exposures. First responders at th e operations level m ust understand an essential form of ICS. This category of responder typicall y includes all firefighters, and m ay apply to emergency m edical personnel, police officers, and private sector employees, depending on the duties the individuals m ust perfor m. Defensive actions inclu de those tak en during a hazardous m aterial incid ent in which there is no inte ntiona l contact with the material in volved. They involve notification and possible evacuation, but not plugging, patching, or cleanup o f spilled o r leaking m aterials. Examples in clude, but are not limited to: SM REGUL sources; vapor suppression; and diking or diverting to keep a release to a confined area. Hazardous Materials Technic ian Hazardous m aterials technicians are pe rsonnel who respond to releases or potential releases for the purpose of stopping the release. They can assum e a more aggressive (offensiv e) m ode of operation than first responders at the operations level. Th ey m ay approach th e release in an effort to plug, patch, or in som e othe r fashion stop the release. Training includes the use of appropriate chem ical protective clothing. This category of responder includes a ll personnel on haza rdous m aterials response team s. Hazardous Materials Specialist Hazardous m aterials sp ecialists perfor m activities sim ilar to those of t he technician, except that th e specialists' responsib ilities require a greater depth of knowledge of the substances i nvolved. The specialist acts as the liaison f or Federa l, State , and local g overnm ental authorities regarding site activ ities. This category of re sponder includes personnel who are hazardous materials team leaders/officers or specialized industrial response personnel. *Note: The def inition s of technician and s pecialist are not clear ly delineated and som e overlapping occurs depending on who is interpreting the law. Onscene Incident Commander IC's are individuals who assum e cont rol of the incident scene beyond the first responder. Norm ally, this individua l is a fire chief, police officer, or plant s afety m anager representing th e lead ag includ es all p ersonnel who m ay fill the command position at so me time during the em ergency. F irst responders awareness m ay act as the initial IC, but the initiation of a multileve l ICS is the dom ain of the operations level. Department of Transportation 49 CFR Parts 100 to 180 49 CFR consists of DOT regulations involved in the transportation and classificatio n of hazardous m aterials. Specifically, this part of the CFR provides infor mation about speci fic hazardous materials, their identification, and classification. The regu lations iden tify the types of cargo co ntainers req uired for th e transportation of various types of chem icals in different m odes of transpo rtation. They contain specific infor mation about compatibilities of cargos as well as requirements for identifying hazardous m aterials shipm ents through placarding and labeling. Additionally, these regulations establish requirem ents for shipping papers and product infor mation needed in case of an e mergency during transportation. As such, 49 CFR i s the primary enforcemen t tool used in the transp ortation of hazardous m aterials. Consen sus Standards As m entioned before, regulations are standards, in particular, m andatory governm ental standards. There are othe r types of standard s as well. Here we will address what are known as consensus standards. Consensus standards are standards that are de veloped by representatives of a specific industry, trade, professi on, etc. In other words, a group of people with related competencies an d backgrounds m eets in order to reach consensus on to how to produce, perfor m, or specify som ething. It is v ital to conside r the poten tial implications of the term \"consensus. \" Consensus m eans that the group reached general agreem ent with respect to the spec ification establis hed in the st andard. As such, consensus standards carry consid erable weig ht when it comes to lega l consid erations. In essence, even though consensus st andards m ust be adopted by an authority having jurisdiction to be mandatory, they still should be considered and properly im plemented. The reason is simple. Although they are not m andatory, consensus st andards represent w hat has been deem ed to be appropriate behavi or by representative m embers of a SM 2-21 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS profession or trade. As such, thes e standards explain \"the way the job should be done\"--the Standard of Care. In short, in a legal setting, you will be judged not only by m andatory standards (regulations), but also by consensus standards. National Fir e Protection Association 471, Recommended Practice for Responding to Haz ardous Materials Incidents National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 471 is a standard generated by the NFPA Technical Comm ittee on Hazardous Materials. This standard outlines minimum operational considerations and guidelines for incidents involving hazardous m aterials. This standard, w hich applies to all responders, addresses considerations such as: incident response planning; response levels; control ination; and safety and comm unications. National Fir e Protection Association 472, Standard for P rofessional Com petenc e of Responders to Hazardous Materials Incidents NFPA 472 is also a stan dard gen erated by th e NFPA Technical Comm ittee on Hazardous Materials. This stand ard establish es specific k nowledge an d competence levels that response pers onnel need in order to respond to hazardous m aterials in cidents safely and effectively. In essence, this standard is the basic training m anual for hazardous m aterials response. The standard classifies response personne l into four basic levels identical to those in OSHA 1910.120--first re sponder awareness, first responder operations, hazardous m aterials tec hnician, and hazard ous m aterials specialist. Any training program based upon the goals and objectives set forth in this docum ent will, in m ost cases, com ply with OSHA m andates. Additionally, in Appendix B, the standard identifie s broad knowledge recomm ended the IC . SM 2-22 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS As with most NFPA training standard s, this particu lar standard is competency-based. This m eans that the personnel receiving training m ust demonstrate the ability to perform specified tasks or functions. Additionally, these personnel will have to demonstrate that they have attained a given level of knowle dge regarding specific term inology, concepts, procedures , and activ ities. National Fir e Protection Association 473, Standard for Com petenc ies for Em ergency Medical Serv ices Personnel Responding to Hazardous Materials Incidents NFPA 473 addresses the specific com petencies needed by Em ergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel for the m anagem ent of responders and victim s at hazardous m aterials incident s. This standard is set up in a fashion sim ilar to other NFPA standards. Guidance Document s and Other Programs Many guidance docum ents and related pr ograms exis t to p rovide direc tion or to outline specific pr ocedures on various aspects of the hazardous materials problem . Some of these docum ents and prog rams will be d iscussed later. However, at th is point, several are m entioned becaus e of their correlation to the hazardous m aterials Stan dard of Care: Hazardous Materials E mergency Planning Guid e--NRT-1. Criteria for Review of Hazardous Materials Em ergency Plans-- NRT-1A. Federal E mergency Managem ent Agency Preparedn ess Guide (CPG)--CPG 1-8 and CPG 1-8a. Chemical Manufacturers Asso ciation (CMA) Community Awareness and Em ergency Response (CAER) Program . These guidance documents and program s provide information for the system atic analysis of hazards and specific ways to develop em ergency operations system s and plans needed to addres s the hazards. As such, they comprise an im portant component of the Standard of Care. SM 2-23 REGUL ATIONS A ND STANDARDS STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.120, paragraph (q )(1) contains a requirem ent for emergency response agencies to develop Emergency Response Pla ns (ERP) . These ERP' s must include Hazard ous Materials Em ergency Response Standard Operating Procedures (SOP's). Stated more sim ply, the ERP is a plan including nothing more com plicated than written SOP' s. These SOP's are a series of guidelin es that describe how a hazardous materials incident will be m anage d by the agencies involved. For our purposes, w e will ref er to the ERP' s as SOP' s. Paragraphs (q)(1) and (2) of 1910.120 o ffer specific recomm endations and guidance on the developm ent of the haz mat SOP' s. It is importan t to note that spec ific inf ormation regardin g local approaches and procedures should be available through the E mergency Response and Operations Plans developed by your LEPC. As the SOP' s are developed, it is crucia l to integ rate them into the operational system deve loped by the LEPC in its plan. The LEPC plan i s available to everyone, including the pub lic, em ergency response agencies, the m edical comm unity, the press, etc. This availab ility is mandated in SARA Title III a s part of the co mmunity planning and right-to -know requirem ents of the Act.

PERSON AL SAFETY SM 3-2 PERSON AL SAFETY INTRODUCTION Personal safety is what this is all about. Specifical ly, the courses that make up the Initial Response to Hazardous Materials Incidents (IRHMI) program are designed to provide firs t responders with the basic knowledge and com petencies needed to p rotect them selves from the hazards encountered during a hazardous m aterials response. By protectin g them selves, responders will be able to help protect other em ergency responders, the general pub lic, and the community. In order to protect yourself, you have to understand som e basic concepts concerning: the nature of em ergency response; the natu re of the chem ical hazard; an d the psychology of res ponders like yourself. This unit discusses these concepts and describes how your knowledge, awareness, and attitude can affect personal safety. The unit concludes with a discussion of safety standards. THE NATURE OF EMERGENCY RESPONSE What m akes an e mergency response diffe rent from a day-to-day or routine situa tion? The answer is simple: control . During day-to-day situations, a relatively high degree of control exis ts ove r most, if not all, of the surroundings. This is especially true with regar d to ch emicals. Man y chem icals in routin e use are extrem ely hazardous substances in term s of toxicity, reactivity, a nd flammability. Yet milli ons of people work with or around these produ cts all the tim e. The only wa y tha t this is poss ible is throug h the use of controls. Controls Controls f all into th ree p rimary categ ories : 1. Physical. 2. Environm ental. 3. Procedural. SM 3-3 PERSON AL SAFETY Physical Controls Physical co ntrols are de signed to keep a chem ical in a giv en location an d under the specific co nditions require d. Norm ally, physical controls involve containers and containmen t systems . Environmental Controls Environm ental controls are designed to detect, elim inate, or m inimize the accum ulation of chem icals in the en vironment. One of the best exam ples of this type of control is the use of ventilation and scrubbers to m inimize the concen tration of vap ors in th e work atm osphere. Other exam ples are containm ent ponds, tanks, and liquid separators. Procedural Controls Procedural controls are used to prot ect people from possible exposures or dangerous reactions. S pecifically, pro cedural contro ls are action s that people take to protect them selves fr om chem icals. Procedures include the wearing of protective e quipm ent (respirators, chem ical aprons, gloves, etc.) o r follo wing specific steps in th e actual han dling of a ch emical. In many situations, com plex and interdependent control systems involving many different ind ividual con trols ar e used. Often, the more dangerous the chem ical, the m ore com plex the contro l sys tem. These contro ls are what allow our society to produ ce, transport, use, and dispose of vast quantities of chem icals with li ttle or no negative effects. Chemical Emergenci es As long as the appropriate controls are in place and functioning properly, things are just fine. However, when one or more cont rols are lost, for whatever reason, there is a problem . This problem can be referred to as an incident. For our purposes, an incident is any situation in which a product (chem ical) escapes or threatens to escape its container. Not all su ch incidents are e mergencies. If the situation can be brought under control readily and easily by those in the immedi ate area, with no potential health hazard, th ere is no em ergency (OSHA 29 CFR Part 1910.120 ). By far the vast m ajority of chem ical releas es or potential releases f all into th is catego ry. SM 3-4 PERSON AL SAFETY For exam ple, a quart co ntainer of mo tor oil slip s from a mechanic' s hand while it is being poured into the oil fill. The can falls on the floor and spills on to the surface. This is an incident becau se produ ct has escaped its intended location. Yet this is not an emergency. The m echanic can very readily, eas ily, and saf ely clean up the spill with a rag or abso rbent clay. However, certain inciden ts accelerate in to em ergencies of varying degree. In som e cases, an incident starts when the f irst con trol fails, and a n unfortunate series of events b egins. Becau se m any of the co ntrols function as system s, the loss of one contro l often crea tes a domino effect w ithin the entire system . If control cannot be regained in a relatively short p eriod of time, the domino effect can be extensive; an emergency now exists. In other ins tances, a simple chang e in the quantity or hazard of the product produces an entirely different situ ation. For exam ple, consider the previous m otor-o il sp ill scena rio. This tim e, inste ad of a 1-quar t spill inside the g arage, th e mechanic sp ills a 55-gallon drum of the sam e motor oil. There is so m uch oil that it flows fro m the garage out onto the ramp and park ing area. In most lo cation s, this would be considered a lim ited- scale em ergency, not b ecause it will necessarily hurt or k ill peop le, but because it cannot be readily and easily handled by those in the immediate area. It is a lso a po tential th reat to the environm ent. Therefore, the spill may not be a critical emergency, but it must be m anaged ac cording to the Standard of Care and standard operating procedures (SOP' s). Now, suppose that instead of m otor oil, the m echanic spills a 55-gallon drum of ant ifreeze, con taining ethy lene glycol. At the curb is a storm sewer inlet. This is now not only an e mergency, but potentially one with far-rea ching implication s. Ethylene glyc ol is tox ic and wate r-soluble. By entering the storm sewe r, the product could be transported to a body of water, where it could kill m ost aquatic life and spread over an even greater area. The point is that when contro l is los t, a series of even ts star ts to take pla ce. Even subtle changes in the scenar io can produce a m ajor impact upon the magnitude and hazard o f the incident. Each in cident m ust be treated as a unique situation. Unfortunately, the old adage, \"fam iliarity breeds contem pt\" is all too true. If e mergency responders treat an em ergency situation without the respect it deserv es, they are asking for an injury or worse. If the enemy is underestim ated, your defenses m ay be overwhelm ed. SM 3-5 PERSON AL SAFETY The Nature of Chemical Incide nts Incidents involving chem icals can be nasty situations that provide no graphic clu es about th e true n ature of the h azard. In other words, responders often totally underestim ate the dangers involved. In m any incidents, responders even have failed to identif y that an unusual hazard exists. How m any tim es has a fire engi ne driven through a chem ical spill, a police officer lit a flare near a fla mmable liquid spill, or an unprotected medic rushed right up to a contam inated victim ? Such seem ingly silly or m inor lapses can be and have been lethal! Do not underestim ate the poten tial hazard when chemicals are inv olved. W hen you ask the driver, \"W hat is this stuff? \" and receive the re sponse, \"It' s like lime,\" do not settle for that answ er. That is not what you asked or need to know. Sodium fluoride could be said by the uninformed to be like sodium chloride. Sodium chloride is table salt; sod ium f luoride is a deadly poison. Psychology of Response Besides understanding em ergency situati ons and variables, it is crucial to understand som e basics about em ergency responders. During an emergency response, certain psy chologi cal o ccurrences take place within the m ind of the responder. Needless to say, a wide range of possibilities exists depending on the individual, th e am ount of training and education, length of service, experience, and type of incident. It may seem odd to have to m ake this statem ent, but emergency scen es are dangerous and po tentially lethal ! W hy? Because of the lack of contro l. There is no other job that allows or requires its employees to work in an uncontrolled environm ent, but that is what em ergency response is all abou t. If events were not to som e degree out of control, e mergency responders would not be necessary. It is vital to understand that the way a chem ical is handled and its hazards are identif ied in th e day -to-day settin g may be totally differen t during an em ergency. Because this sim ple fact often is ignored, m any people have been and will be injured or killed needlessly. This includes em ergency responders. Although the range of psychological responses varies, responders generally s hare certain reactions. First, upon being dispatched, m ost individuals have a basic ad renaline rush: there is excitem ent. The m ore extraordinary (due to m agnitude, type, etc.) the response, the m ore the adrena line is likely to f low. On th e other hand, the m ore ordinary and routine the response is fo r the individual, the less adrenaline is likely to flow. Either case can be extrem ely dangerous to responders if they do not realize what is happening. SM 3-6 PERSON AL SAFETY At whichever end of the em otional spectrum the res ponder is found, emotion has the tendency to put the brai n in neutral. The responder is not thinking but, rather, react ing. As a result, the responder is at the m ercy of the em ergency situation. When responders perceive the incident to be highly unusual, dangerous, or emotionally charged, they often experience tunnel vision . Tunnel vision occurs when responders focus on one aspe ct of the situation and lose sight of the overall incident. On the othe r hand, if the responde rs perceive the incident to be routine, they m ay go on autopilot . In eith er cas e, the y becom e oblivious to their surroundings and thus are at the m ercy of the incident. Laziness can figure prom inently in both situations. This trait is found in responders who have not been appropr iately trained or who have been allowed to settle into a pa ttern. W hatever the reason, laziness can be just as deadly as emotion . THE COMPONENTS OF SAFETY To ensure safety in emerge ncy response situations, both organiz ational and persona l factors m ust be addressed. Th e major com ponents of safety, summarized in the table below, are d iscussed in the following sections. COMPONENTS OF SAFETY Organizational Personal Discipline Knowledge Comm and Awareness Managem ent Attitude Organizational Components of Safet y The nature of e mergency response suggest s that som e lack of control m ust always be assum ed in t he work envir onment. Key factors that em ergency response organizations must address to maximize control (and thus safety) include discipline, command, and m anagem ent. Disciplin e must be m aintained by all personne l in order to ga in procedural contro l esse ntial to saf ety. In par ticular, \"freelancing\" by individuals-- \"doing your own thing\" at an em ergenc y incident--m ust be avoided. W ays SM 3-7 PERSON AL SAFETY in which o rganiz ations can m aintain dis cipline includ e nd education, developm ent of com prehensive SOP' s, and assignm ent of a Safety Officer at every incident. Command structures (chain of comm and) and procedures must be defined clearly to ensure that all pe rsonnel understand their roles and responsibilities. Th is requirem ent helps ensure the integrity of work crews and the acco untability of individu al responders. Management by officers or team leaders m ust be adequate to evaluate the operation continually and to id entify potentia l saf ety pro blems for the members. If an assignm ent is questi onable due to safety considerations, the IC and/or Safety Offi cer m ust be consulted. Personal Components of Safe ty In order to operate safely during any situation, res ponders need three personal attributes of safety: 1. Knowledge. 2. Awareness. 3. Attitud e. Know ledge com es from training, educati on, and experience. Responders need to know specifically how to do their jobs. This m eans an indepth understanding of the SOP' s of the agency. They m ust be intim ately familiar with what they are expected to do, how they are expected to do it, and how to use the equipm ent needed for the job. Know ledge is essentia l. Awareness is closely tied to knowledge and to other cog nitive skills . Responders must be aware of exactly what is occurring at the incident scene and b e able to extrapo late h ow that m ay affect them and others. They m ust be aware of the poten tial da ngers asso ciated with specific types of situations, even when those dangers are not readily apparent. Attitude is the psychological approach you bring to th e incident. A responder needs to h ave an appropriate attitud e abou t em ergency response--not an attitude problem . This attitude m ust refl ect the fact that the poten tial hazard s associated with a giv en situation are not always obvious. As a result, responders must follow the ir SOP' s, even when the y seem to be tim e-consuming or a total pa in. Do not allow la ziness to enter SM 3-8 PERSON AL SAFETY the pictu re, because the incident can deterio rate in the wink of an eye. Those changes can and do kill! Knowledge and awaren ess, com bined w ith an ap propria te attitude, are the bridge to personal safe ty. Attitude is th e key--you will not g ain knowledge or awareness without the proper attitude. Developing a good attitude is up to you! It is personal. You are the only one who can do anything about it. Em ergency response is your job! Safety is your job! Having the right attitud e backed u p with know ledge and aw areness is your responsibility .

In Unit 2: Regulation s and Stand ards we reviewed sev eral stand ards that were specific to h azardous m aterials em ergencies. We now briefly exam ine a series of standards that address gene ric safety aspects of o perations an d protective equipm ent. NFPA 1500 Standard on Fire Department Occupational Safety and Health Program. NFPA 1500, adopted in 1989 to help addr ess the safety needs of the fire service, has broad application to all responders. Relevant topics include the develop ment of written SOP' s for incident command a nd other areas, the designation of a safety supervisor, safety con sidera tions for all phase s of department operations, physical f itness, baseline medical testing, medical m onitoring, a system of s upervision during operations, and so forth. NFPA 19 70 Series In the 1970 series, NF PA addresses the various protective equipm ent components for structural firefight ing. These standards include NFPA 1971, Standard on Protective Ensemb le for Structural Fire Fighting . NFPA 1972, Standard on Helmets for St ructural Fire Fighting. NFPA 1973, Standard on Gloves for Structur al Fire Fighting. NFPA 1974, Standard on Protective Footwe ar for Structural Fire Fighting. NFPA 1975, Standard on Station/Work Uniforms for Fire Fighters. NFPA 1980 series The NFPA 1980 series addre sses the precise safety equipm ent to be used in conjunction with the personal protective equipm ent (PPE) identified in the 1970 series. These standards include SM 3-17 PERSON AL SAFETY NFPA 1981, Standard on Open-Circuit Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus for Fire Fighters. NFPA 1982, Standard on Personal Alert Safety Systems (PASS) for Fire Fighters. NFPA 1983, Standard on Fire Service Life Safety Rope and System Components. NFPA 19 90 Series The NFPA 1990 series addresses m inimum design and m anufacturing specification for various types of chem ical protectiv e equip ment (CPE). These stand ards include NFPA 1991, Standard on Vapor-Protecti ve Suits for Hazardous Chemical Emergencies. NFPA 1992, Standard on Liquid Splash-Protective Suits for Hazardous Chemical Emergencies. NFPA 1994, Standard on Protective Clot hing for Chemical/ Biological R esponse to T errorism Incidents In general, chem ical protective clothi ng is not for use by first responders. More on Chem ical protective eq uipm ent (CPE) and related training requirem ents is in Unit 7: Personal Protective Equipm ent. OCCUP ATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALT H ADMINIST RATION S AFETY- RELATED REGULATIONS Various saf ety regulations have been developed by OSHA and other agencies. Specifically, in the context of hazardous su bstances an d emergency response, tw o regulations m ust be identified. Both regulations are found in 29 CFR Part 1910, Subpart s L and Z. (Rem ember, this regulation correlates to the EPA 40 CFR Part 311.) 29 CFR 1910 Subpart L, Fire specific requirem ents fo r the developm ent, operation, and manage ment of fire brigades. Subpa rt L ad dresses requirements that include m inimum equipm ent, positive -pressure self-contained breathing apparatus (S CBA' s), PPE, extinguishi organizational operations, and training Z, 1910.1000 to 1910.1048 address toxic and hazardous substance ex posure lim its and protectiv e measures. This section cons ists of a series of charts that lis t exp osure lim its and prote ctive equipm ent requirem for specific chem icals. The subsequent section s describ e specific action s, precau tions, procedu res, surveillan ce, etc., for employees exposed to the listed substances. SUMMARY The key characteristic of em ergency re sponse situations that m akes the m different and dangerous is lack of control. Three typ es of chem ical controls exist during ro utine operations: physical, environm ental, and procedural. During em ergency conditions, the prim ary m ethod is procedural. Inappropriate psychological responses during an em ergency can get you killed. The organizational com ponents of safety in a hazardous m aterials inciden t are discip line, command, and m anagem ent. The personal components of safety are knowle dge, awareness, and attitude. Knowledge com es from training and e xperience. Awareness of the overall situation an d specific hazards grow s out of knowledge and experience. Attitud e is the approach you take to the inciden t. There is no margin at an inciden t scene for lazin ess and lack of attention to procedures. Inform ation on safety procedures is based on NFPA standards and OSHA regulations.

It discusses their m easur ement, e ffects on the hum an body, a nd the im plications of contam inating yourself and others. The purpose of learning about toxico logy is to enable you, the first responder, to understan d the risks associated with hazardou s materials so that you can respond saf ely and appropriately. TOXICOLOGY What is Toxicolog y? Toxicology is the science of poisons: their effects on the body, their detection in body fluids and tissues, and the various antidotes for their effects. Hippocrates, the \"Father of Medicine\" (460 to 377 B.C.), discussed the toxic effects of drugs. He pointed out that the only difference between a toxic dose and a therapeutic dose w as the quantity prescribed or taken by the patient. As early as the 1500' s, scientists st arted to m ake a connection between certain substances and hea lth hazards. In the 1700' s, scientists began to see the relationship between worker exposure to certain substances and health problem s. At that tim e, though, health problem s were considered an accep ted risk of an occupation. Despite its history, m odern toxicology is considered a new science. It wasn' t until the e arly 20th cen tury that a genuine awarenes s of hazards related to occupational exposure to cer tain substances developed. This awareness evolved into the di scipline of industrial hygiene. Industrial Hygiene We can' t discuss toxicology without discussing industrial hygiene. Industrial hygiene is the science involved with the protection of workers' health th rough m easurem ent of the wo rk enviro nment to determ ine if and where hazards exist. Scientists use various scientific m ethods and instrum ental equipm ent to m easure ga ses, v apors, and du sts in th e air, extrem es of heat or cold, noise, repetitive motion, and other work environm ent hazards. SM 4-3 TOXICOL OGY Simply stated, industrial hygi ene is the m easurem ent of \"how much\" for \"what duration of time.\" This translates to the dose . Infor mation on dose is co mpared pr ovided by toxicological studies to determ ine the effects of a substance on the body. Such analyses are better known as dose/response studies. Industrial hygiene is th e application of toxicology to the work environm ent. As such, the study of industrial hygiene has led to better understanding of approaches for safe and efficient response to chem ical incidents. Thus toxicology and i ndustrial hygiene for m the foundation for the hazardous m aterials Standard of Care. The Occupational Safety and Health Act In 1970, the Occupational Safe ty and Health Act established guidelines for worker saf ety. Until that tim e very few guidelin es existed. The Act also estab lished the Occupational Saf ety and Health Adm inistration (OSHA), the Federal agency tasked with enforcing existing guidelines. Today, exposure lim its exist for m any known hazardous m aterials. Th ese standard s and guidelines protec t workers from the hazards of overexposure. Types of Hazards Generally speaking, chem ical substan ces present two types of hazards: physical (mechanical) h azards; and health (bio logical) hazards. Physical hazards act indirectly to cause ha rm. They include fires or explosions or other effects created by m echanical m eans. Gasoline is a good exam ple. Classified as a flammabl e liquid, it is both a fire hazard and an explosive hazard. Even the vapors can be explosive. Health hazards cause direct harm . If these products contact your body directly, they cause biological reac tions, destroying tissue or m aking you ill. The response or adverse reaction m ay be immed iate or delayed . Acids are go od exam ples of imm ediate hazards. If an acid contacts sk in, it immediately burns the area with whic h it com es in contac t. Toxicity Most people understand the word \"toxic\" to m ean i mmediately life threatening. However, a toxic subs tance is any substance, which can cause a h armful effect once it reaches a susc eptible ta rget, such as th e SM 4-4 TOXICOL OGY human body (eyes, lungs, skin, etc.) or other living organism by other than physical m eans. Toxicity is a health hazard. Tox ic substances and criteria for classifying them are described in 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1910.1200. It is im portant to understand how toxi city is determ ined (or measured ) for a particu lar substance. The tox icity of a substance depends on the concentration of the substance , type of exp osure, route of exposu re, susceptible target orga n, and other health-related variab les. In other words, how much, where, and for how long? Concentration Concentration is the amount of one substance found in a given volum e of another substance. Depending on th e materials involved, there are m any different ways of expressing concentr ation. Two of the m ost comm on ar e parts pe r million (ppm ) and m illigrams per kilogram (mg/kg). Parts Per Million One m ethod to m easure con centratio n is in com parison with a giv en volum e of a ir or liqu id. In other wo rds, you need one m illion parts of air or liqu id and a certain nu mber of parts of the substance. Milligrams Per Kilogra m Dose by ingestion is determ ined by comparing the unit weight of the poison ( in milligram s) to un it bo dy weight ( in kilogram s). Fo r skin absorption, surface area would be measured. Type of Exposure Exposure is defined as direct bodily contact with a substance. For purposes of this course, there are three types of expos ures: acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute Acute exposure is of short durati on. Exposure to a substance with duration m easured in seconds, m inutes , or even hours m ay be considered acute. As applied to inges tion, it m eans a single dose. SM 4-5 TOXICOL OGY Subacute Subacute ex posures are a series of acute expo sures th at occur with an interval of tim e in between. Chronic Chronic exposure m eans exposure of long duration or prolonged or repeated exposures that occur over hour s, days, m onths, a nd years. F or exam ple: A 10-m inute exposure to benzene, depending on concentration, probably would not cause cancer; howe ver, 40 hours a week for 10 years is known to cause cancer at certain c oncentrations. This is a chronic exposure. Note : Repeated exposur es can result in sensitiz ation . For exam ple: Form aldehyde exposure can result in allergic reactions to future exposures. Routes of Exposure Routes of exposure are the paths by which a substance enters the body. There are four prim ary routes of exposure: inhalation, ingestion, absorption/contact, and injection. Inhalation Inhalation involves the breathing in of a substance, leading to direct contac t with tis sues in the resp iratory tra ct (nose, th roat, trachea, and lungs). Ingestion Ingestion is the swallowing of a s ubstance, r esulting in contact with the digestive tract (m outh, throat, esoph agus, stom ach, and intestines). Absorption/ Contact Absorption/Contact involves direct contact with the skin and the destruction and/or passage of the m aterial through the skin and eyes. SM 4-6 TOXICOL OGY Injection Injection is the entry of a subs tance through a break in the skin. Susceptible Target Organ A target organ is an organ, such as lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys, liver, central nervous system , etc., upon which a subs tance has a toxic effect. OSHA has specific standards in 29 CFR 191 0.1200 that describe target organs. Do not confuse target organs and routes of exposure. For exam ple, if you breathe a pesticide the route of exposure is inhalation. The m aterial enters the lung, yet the target organ is the central nervous system . The following graphic shows the m ost im portant targ et organs for chem ical exposure. Target Organs And Body Parts Nervous System Skeleton & Marrow Thyroid Lungs Heart Blood Veins Liver Kidneys Intestines Skin Other Health Variables Other im portant factors in determ ining toxicity are body weight, age, physical co ndition, and gender of the potential victim . The very youn g and the very old tend to be weak er and more susceptible. So me substances, such as thalidom ide, cause cancer or birth defects. Other substances affect m ale reproductive organs. SM 4-7 TOXICOL OGY Dose/Response These five factors (concentration, type of exposure, route of exposure, susceptible target organ, and other health-related v ariables) affect dose/response, the relationship between the exposure and the biological effect that is produced. Dose Dose is the concentration of a substa nce considered with regard to th e length of tim e of the exposure. For exam ple, if you follow the doctor' s prescription for taking a m edicine, you will receive a th erapeutic dose. This is because the medicin e will be in a safe concentration when absorbed by the body. However, if you exceed the doctor' s prescriptions--for exam ple by taking a whole bottle of pills a t once- -the result could be a toxic dose. The concentratio n of the m edicin e will be m uch higher because a greater amount is absorbed in a lim ited period of tim e. In both cases, th e medicine was th e sam e, but the response was very different, depending on the dose. Even seem ingly nontoxic substances can have a negative health effect if the dos e is too great (e.g., table salt). It is also im portant to rem ember that indivi duals can differ significantly in their response to various chem icals or doses. Immediate Versus Delayed Response Some substances affect your body upon contact, or imme diately ; other substances take tim e to react with your body, som etimes as long as 24 to 72 hours ( delayed reaction ). Som e substances do both. An exam ple of an immediate effect would be chlorine. It causes an immediate reaction: co ughing, cho king, or unconsciousness. It could also conceivably cause delayed reaction: edem a--fluid buildup in the lungs. Another example of delayed reaction w ould be the pesticide Malathion. It causes a delayed reactio n because it is a system ic poison. It takes tim e to go through the b loodstream and to reach its targ et organ, the central nervous system . Som e products (e.g., carcinogens) m ay have an effe ct many years down the road. SM 4-8 TOXICOL OGY Measures of Toxicity In an attem pt to establish a m ethod fo r com paring the relative toxicity of substances, specific m ethods and te rms have been developed. The following term s are widely used when discussing and com paring toxicity. Values for different products can be found in m any reference books and in shipping papers, Material Safety Data Sheets (M SDS) for ms, etc. MLD (Median Lethal Dose) is a m ethod de veloped by scientists to determ ine a substanc e's toxic ity o r to com pare the toxicity of different substances. MLD is determ ined by exposing a group of test anim als to a predeterm ined am ount of a substance, e.g., 10 mg/kg. If 50 percent of the anim als die, the m edian lethal dose would be determ ined. LD50 (lethal dose to 50 percent of those exposed) is determ ined by ingestion or skin absorption . LC50 (lethal concentration to 50 percen t of those exposed) is determ ined by inhalation . Note : The lower the number, the more toxic the dose/concentration. - For LD 50, less than 200 ppm (mg/kg) is considered a poison. - For LC 50, less than 150 ppm (mg/kg) is considered a poison. A resource f or this da ta is the Na tional Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) book called, Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). The Am erican Conference of Governm ental Industrial Hygienists (ACG IH) also puts out in its pocket guide the testing inform ation to determ ine exposure lim its. The following definition s are taken from the publication, 2002 7th Edition Threshold Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents and Biological Exposure Indices . Threshold Lim it Value/Tim e W eighted Averag e (TLV/TWA) is the time-weighted average con centration for a norm al 8-hour workday and a 40-hour workweek, to which nearly all workers m ay be repeatedly exposed, day after day, without adverse effect. Threshold Lim it Value/Short-Term Exposure Lim it (TLV/STEL ) is the concentration to which wor kers can be exposed continuously for a s hort period of tim e without suffering from 1) irritation, 2) chronic or irreversible tissue damage, or 3) narcosis of suff icient degree to increas e the likelihood injury , impair self-rescue, or SM 4-9 TOXICOL OGY materially reduce work effici ency, and provided that the daily TLV/TW A is not exceeded. It is not a separate independent exposure lim it, rather it supplem ents the TWA limit where there are recogni zed acute effects from a substance whose toxic effects are prim arily of a chron ic nature. ST EL's are recomm ended only where toxic effects have been reported from high short-term exposures in either hum ans or anim als. A STEL is defined as a 15-m inute TW A expos ure which should not b e exceeded at any tim e during a workday even if the 8-hour TWA is within the TLV/TWA. Exposures above the T LV/TWA u p to the STEL should not be longer than 15 m inutes and should not occur m ore than four tim es per day. T here should be at least 60 m inutes between successive exposures in this rang e. An averaging period other than 15 m inutes m ay be recomm ended when this is warranted by observed biological effects. Threshold Lim it Value-Ceiling (TLV-C ) is th e concentratio n that shou ld not be ex ceeded during any part of the working exposure. Perm issible Exposure Lim it (PEL) is the am ount of product that you m ay be exposed to without toxic effect over a given period of tim e. Imm ediately Dangerous to Life and Health (IDLH) is another m easurem ent used by NIOSH. IDLH determ ines the highest concentration of a substance and the length of exposure before it is imm ediately dangerous. SM Monitoring and Detection Equipment By now you m ust be wondering how you are going to know if you are overexposed or under the TLV? Only trained personnel using specialized equipm ent over tim e can determ ine th at. If a substance has a TLV, an LD50, or an LC 50, wear your personal ective ent (PPE). Num erous detection dev ices are availa ble on the m arket. Som e specialize in detecting a group of s ubstances, others detect one particular substance. Some give direc t quantitative readou ts with m argins f or error. Still oth ers measure total volum e of all substan ces. Mo st of these devices are expensive, com plicated, have lim ited use and capability, and, m ost importantly, m ust be operated by pr ofessionals trained to use the instrum ents. Unless you know how to in terpret the data and apply them to some standard as they relate to health ha zards, the data are of no use to you. This is not an area in which a fi rst responder should be involved. Avoiding Expos ure If you find yourself in an area that may be contam inated, avoid exposure- - then you don' t have to worry about the concentration. Avoid breathing the substance. SM 4-11 TOXICOL OGY Don' t smoke, eat, chew , or put your hand in your m outh or near your face. Don' t touch anything that m ay ha ve com e in contact with the substance. Remember, vapors, m ists, and dusts can travel lo ng distan ces, and leave residues behind! If you do get contam inated, get decontam inated and get m edical attention. If there is a source of inform ation available, take it with you. Call a poison center or chem ical regional center. Material Safety Data Sheets An i mportant source of toxicological information is th e MSDS, Of ten these m ay be found with transporta tion shipping papers or at fixed facilities. Copies also m ay be availa ble through the local fire departm ent or Local Emergency Planning Comm ittee (LEPC). MSDS contain specific inform ation m andated by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.1200 that can be very valuable to emergency responders. This information include s chem ical and common nam es; physical and chem ical properties; physical and health h azards; prim ary routes of exposure; exposure lim its; safe handlin g precau tions; emergency and first easures; and contact person/com pany.

HEALTH HAZARD DATA Emergency Overview : Brown liquid with m ild odor. Can evolve irritating and/or sensitizing vapors when heated. Hot liquid can react vigorously with water, generating CO 2. Exposure Limits: Not established f or this product. Use the exposure lim its listed below for MDI. For MDI: OSHA PEL: 0.02 ppm Ceiling ACGIH TLV: 0.005 ppm Ti me Weighted Average NE = Not Established NA = Not Availab le SM 4-15 TOXICOL Revised: Primary Routes of Entry: Inhalation, eye contact, skin contact, and ingestion. Effects o f Overexposure: Note: Airbo rne levels of MDI are no t anticipated to exceed exposure lim its under norm al conditions of use unless m aterial is heated or sprayed. Inhalation : Acute Exposure: Vapors or m ist at con centrations above the exposure lim its for MDI m ay irritate the m ucous m embranes in th e respiratory tract cau sing runny nose, sore throat, coughing, chest discom fort, shortness of breath, and reduced lung function. May also cause vom iting and possibly fever. Individuals with preexisting, nonspecific bronchial hyperactivity m ay respond to conc entrations below the T LV with sim ilar symptoms as well as asthm a attack. Exposure well above the TLV m ay lead to bronchitis, bronchial spasm and pulm onary e dema (fluid in the lungs). These effects m ay be irreversible. Sym ptoms may occur up to several hours after exposure. Chronic Exposure: As a result of previ ous repeated overexposures or exposure to a single large dose of isocyanate, susceptibl e individuals may develop MDI sensitization (chem ical asthm a) which will caus e them to r eact to later exposure to isocyanates at levels well below the TLV. These sym ptoms, which can inc lude chest tigh tness, wheezing, cough, shortn ess of breath or asthm a attack, cou ld be imm ediate or delayed up to several hours after exposure. There are reports that once sensitized an individual can experience these sym ptoms upon exposure to dus t, cold air or othe r irritants. This increased sensitivity can persist for weeks and in severe cases for several years. Overexposure to isocyanates has also been reported to cause l ung dam age, including decrease in lung function, which m ay be perm anent. Sensitization can either be temporary or perm anent. Skin Contact: May cause irritation with reddeni ng, swelling, rash, scaling or blistering. Cured m aterial is difficult to rem ove. Some individuals m ay develop skin se nsitization. Individuals who have developed a skin sensitization may develop these sym ptoms as a resu lt of contact with very sm all amounts of liquid or following exposure to vapor. SM 4-16 TOXICOL OGY Page Revised: Eye Contact: May cause irritation, including exces s redness an d swelling o f the conjun ctiva. Swallow ing: May resu lt in irr itation and possibly corrosive action in the m outh, stom ach tissue and digestive tract. Based on anim al studies, m aterial has low oral toxicity. SECTION 4. FIRST AID MEAS URE S Breathing: Re move victim to an ar ea where no further exposure can occur. Adm inister oxygen or artificial respiration as needed. Get m edical attention. Skin Contact: Imm ediately rem ove contam inated clothing and shoes, and wash affected area with plenty of soap and water for at least 15 m inutes. Use em ergency shower if needed.

Face it, there is nothing flashy or enthralling about placards and labels. Unfortunately, as a result, responders have a tendency to downplay the importance of the inform ation. This is a pot entially lethal mista ke! R&I clues are your first line of defense against hazardous m aterials and their potential effects on you, the em ergency responder. If you do not recognize that hazardous materials are or m ay be involved in the incident, you alm ost certainly will put yourself and other responders in a position that is po tentially lif e threatening. You risk unnecessary exposures to all of the h azards p resent in the danger zone o f the incident. You will not recognize the need to is olate the immediate incident scene, establish a perim eter, and deny entry. In other words, if you, the first resp onder, do not recogni ze the presence or potential presence of hazardous subs tances on the incident scene, you are now part of the problem and cannot be part of the solution . RECOGNITION AND IDENTIFICATION CLUES Generally speaking, there are six es tablished R&I clues available to emergency responders: 1. Occupancy and/or location. 2. Container/vehicle shape (size and configuration). 3. Markings and colors. 4. Placards and labels. 5. Papers (shipping papers, MSDS). 6. Senses. The clues we are about to discuss can enable you to becom e part of t he solution and not part of the problem . Learn them well becaus e they are as much a part of your \"personal protectiv e ensem ble\" as a bulletproof vest, a set of turnouts, or steel-tipped shoe s. The better you know and understand these c lues, the saf er you will be in the chem ical world in which we live. SM 5-4 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Occupancy /Location Occupancy and location are not ne w term s to m any responders. Occupancy is the type of use to which a structure or location is dedicated. In other words, the building serves as a dwelling (single fam ily, apartm ent, condo, townhouse, etc.), a busine ss (office, etc.), an industry (manufacturer of some product), mercantile center (s ales), sto rage (warehousing, etc.), farm, and so on. Location is the sp ecific geographic area, address, installation, etc., of the inciden t. The location can be alon g an Interstate highway, a rail line, or a pipeline; it can be a spot within a speci fic building or facil ity; or it can be the street address of a private dwelling. Knowledge of the occupancy/location can provide vital inform ation about the potential for th e presence of hazardo us materials. Consider the following occupancies and locations and the potential f or the pres ence o f hazardous substances in each: an outbuilding on a farm; a swimm ing pool sales store; a greenhouse; a metal plating or finishing shop; a woodworking shop; a personal garage; a vehicle a \"you-store-it\" facility; a pharm aceutical house; and the loading dock at a factory. The bottom line is tha t all of these occupancies or locations have a strong probability of involving hazardous subs tances. From the occupancy an d location, you also m ay get clues on the type of hazard involv ed. If you respond to such a location a nd do not at least consider that hazardous substances may be present, you are part of the problem . It is the responsibility o f all response pe rsonnel (for their own protection) to be fa miliar with their area of respons e and the types of occ upancies an d locations within that area th at may contain hazardou s substances. Knowledge about occupancy and locati on can provide critical inform ation. SM RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Container/Vehicle Shape Various types of containers are used to transport, handle, and store specific typ es of hazard ous and nonhazar dous m aterials. The appearance of these containers can tell you a lot about the produc t they hold and related hazards. Clues inclu de the con tainer' s shap e, size, and com position; transpo rt vehicle type ; smoothness of the surface or \"skin \"; and visibility of re lated valving or piping. These clues can gi ve some indication of the hazard class, type of product, level of pr essurization, am ount of product, etc. In general, it is useful to classify containers by the ma ximum pressure they norm ally contain. In ad dition, because of certai n fundam ental differences between fixed facility and transporta tion incidents (highway, rail, water, air, or pip eline), it is h elpful to look at these two cate gories separately. We will exam ine in more detail the various types of containers found in each category later in this unit. Markings and Colors Markings and colors are R&I tools th at can assist you in recognizing the possible presence of hazardous m aterial s. Various system s are used by different producers and for different purposes. Except for those m andated by law or regulations, these system s are voluntary and can change with little o r no n otice. Several im portan t syste ms of markings and colo rs: container markings and stencils; National Fire Protecti on Association (NFPA) 704 Standard System for the Iden tification of the Fire Hazards of Mater ials marking system ; hazard com munication system s; and military sys tem. Railcar Stencils All DOT specif ication conta iners must have m arkings indicating the particular D OT specifications th ey m eet. The specifications must be m et in order to transport DOT-regulated m aterials. Other m arkings can include vehicl e identification num bers and Railcars a GATX 55512 identifies the specific car. DOT 105 is the DOT specification. NFPA 704 System The 704 system uses a diam ond si milar to a DOT placard su bdivided to four s maller diam onds. The diam onds are color coded to indicate specific hazards. FLAMMABILITY (red) REACT IVITY (yellow) SPECIAL (white)HEALTH (blue) NFPA 704 Hazard System INTRODUCTION ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Within each diam ond is a num ber from 0 to 4 indicating th e hazard lev el in em ergency situati ons. Zero indicates no hazard and 4 indicates a major hazard. For exam ple, gasoline is li sted as a 3 un der flamm ability. Special hazards in clude oxidizers, pol ymerization, water reactivity, etc. Most commonly the 704 system is used at fixed facilities. Hazard Communications (HazCom) System This system commonly referred to as the Hazard ous Materials Inform ation System (HMIS) is u sed to m eet Occupational Safety and Health Adm inistration (OSHA) em ployee ri ght-to-know requirem ents that are part of the hazard co mmunicatio ns m andates. In general, the sy stem provides basic inform ation regard ing the substance' s nam e, hazards, safe handling and use. There are often i ndications as to appropriate personal protective equipm ent (PPE). The HMIS uses a color and num ber system similar to the 704. In the case of HMIS, the color/number system can be found in th e \"diamond-within- a-diam ond\" or a color bar form at. HMIS or HazCom inform ation, colors, and m arkings are found on individual containers. The containers can range from pint jars to 55-gallon drum s, and in s ome cases, to railcars. It is vital to know that the inform ation provide d is specifically designed to inform employees of the hazards fou nd in the \"n ormal\" work environm ent and not during an emergency . Other co lor system s also exist. Howe ver, these system s generally are not uniform because usually they are voluntary. For example, there is supposedly a uniform compressed gas cy linder color-coding system that can be used by the entire industry. Unfortunately, m ost producers use their ow n color codes. Another example is the \"candy stripes,\" the white rail tank car with red stripes used by certain manufacturers to transport hydrocyanic acid. Many m anufacturers did not color code their cars this way. As of 2003, this color coding system has bee n phased out completely, although if ther e are still cars bearing th is type of m arking and they ar e still within spe cs., they can still be used as such. Military System The m ilitar y system , like the NFP A system , is spec ifically designed to address f ixed loca tions. It g enerally is used on m ilitary installa tions, and not in trans portation. You should be familiar with details of the military system if you have a base within your jurisdiction. SM 5-8 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Placards and Labels Labels are sym bols (at least a 4- inch square diamond) which are affixed to the package being shipped . Every business which offers a m aterial class ified as hazardou s by the DOT m ust mark the pack age contain ing the material with the appro priate labe l or labels, unless otherwise specified. Additional requirem ents include When required, the label(s) m ust be affixed to, or printed on, the surface of th e package n ear th e prop er shipp ing nam e. When two or m ore diffe rent warnin g labels are required, they must be displayed next to each other. These are known and pri mary and subsidiary h azards. Placards are larger symbols (10-3/4- inch square diam ond) which are applied to the sides and end o f a motor vehicle, railcar, freight container, or portable tank containing hazardous materials (640 cubic feet or m ore). Addition al requ irements inc lude Placards generally are no t requ ired on highway transportation until 1,000 kilogram s or 2,205 pounds or m ore of a m aterial is being transpo rted. Exception: Explosives 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, Poison G as 2.3, Dangerous When W et 4.3, Organic Peroxide 5.2 (Type B, liquid or solid temperature controlled), Poison Inhalation Hazard 6.1 (Inhalation Hazard Zone A or B), Radioactiv e Yellow III must be pla carded when any amount is transported. Hazardous m aterials are grouped by m ajor hazard into nin e classes, which are defined as follows: Class 1--Ex plosives : any substance or arti cle, includ ing a device, which is designed to function by explosion. Division 1.1--Mass detonating Exam ples: Dyna mite, TNT, black powder Division 1.2--Mass detonating with fragment s Exam ples: Propellant explosives, rocket motors, spec ial fireworks Division 1.3--Fire hazard with m inor blast or projectile hazard Exam ples: Common fireworks ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION 1.4--Substances which present no significant hazard Exam ples: Sm all arm s ammunition Division 1.5 --Very in sensitive explosives Exam ples: Ammonium nitrate fuel oil mixtures Division 1.6--Extrem ely insensitive explosives Exam ples: Class 2--Ga ses: materials that are flammable, nonflammable, or poisonous gases. Division 2.1--Flamm able gases Exam ples: Propane, anhydrous Division Exam ples: Arsine, phosgene, hydrogen fluoride Class 3--Flammable Liquids : any liquid with a flashpoi nt at or below 140\u00b0 F. Exam ples: Gasoline, acetone, m ethyl alcohol, tolu ene, am yl acetate Class 4--Flammable Solids and Substances : materials that are wetted exp losives, self - reactive, spontaneously com bustib le, reactive. W et Exam ples: Metallic sodium , potassium , calcium carbide Class 5--Ox idizers: materials that may, generally by yielding oxygen, cause or enhance the com bustion of other m aterials. Division 5.1--Oxidizing substances Exam A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Class 6--Poisons : materials, other than a gas, wh ich are known to be so toxic to humans as to afford a hazard to h ealth during transportation. Division 6.1--Poisons Exam ples: Carbon tetrachloride, aniline, Exam ples: Anthrax, botulism , rabies , tetanu s Class 7--Radioactive Materials : materials or c ombinations of materials that spontaneously em it ionizing radiation. Exam ples: Plutonium , cobalt, uranium hexafluoride Class 8--Co rrosives : a liquid or solid that causes vi sible destruction or irreversible alterations in hum an skin tissu e at th e site of contact, o r a liquid that has a severe corrosion rate on steel or alum inum . Exam ples: acid Class 9--Miscellaneous Haz ardous Materials : materials th at pres ent a hazard du ring transpo rt, but which are not included in any other hazard class . Exam ples: Unslaked lim e, metallic mercury, dry ice, bleach ing powder, molten sulfur, PCB' s, nitrous oxide ORM-D--C onsumer co mmodities Exam ples: Household ammonia, spot remover Both labels and placards denote only the major haz ard. Many m aterials have properties th at meet the criteria of more than one class. The DOT has established the following class priority fo r mater ials having more than one hazard class : radioa ctive flammable gas; material INTRODUCTION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION irritating m aterials; combustible liquid (containers m ore than 110 gal.); and combustible liquid (containers less than 110 gal.). Exceptions to this priority sequence are provided by the DOT for explosives, etiologic agents, and or ganic peroxides (see 49 CFR 173.2). Shipping Papers/Material Safet y Data Sheets Different types of ship ping papers are used for different m odes of transpo rtation. In general, the person in charge of the vehicle is the person who will ha ve the pape rs. The papers should be located In the cab of a truck or with the driver in highway transport. Papers are called a bill of lading . In the engine (or caboose if pres ent) or with the cr ew in rail transpo rt. Papers are called a cons ist. In the wheelhouse or a special container on a barge, or with the crew in ship s. Papers are called a dangerous cargo manifest . In the cockp it or with th e pilot of an aircraft. Papers are called an air bill . As previously discussed, MSDS' s are also an important so urce of R&I inform ation for responders. They m ay be found with the shipping papers. Other possible sources of MSDS' s include your State Em ergency Response Comm ission (SERC), Local Emergency Response Comm ittee (LEPC), product m anufacturers, fixed facilities that use or store th e chem ical, and fire departm ents. Re member: Emergency services have the right to req uest cop ies of MSDS fo rms for use in incident planning and operations. Human Senses Vision plays a key role in all clues we have discussed so far, and in determ ining the presence of fire, sm oke, va por or gas clouds, etc. Unfortunately, our sense of vision is lim ited when light or visibility is poor. SM 5-12 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND , esp ecially when witne sses are p resent or th ere are unusual sounds. However, rem ember to rem ain at a safe distance when trying to gain infor mation a bout an incident through vision or hearing. The use of other senses--taste, touch, or sm ell--risk s an exposure to the substance. These senses should not be used intentionally in an incident. Summar y of the Six Clues Consider the following situations. 1. No police officer would respond to a reported silent alarm at a bank or a store withou t at leas t sus pecting that there may be a robbery/burglary in progress. The officer would not sim ply go to the front door and walk in, unless he or she was rather foolish. 2. No m edic would respond to a re ported severe laceration of a patient at an AIDS clinic wit hout donning disposable gloves and possibly other protective clothing as well. To do so also would be foolish on the part of the m edic. 3. No firefighter would walk into the living room of a house with smoke banked down to the floor w ithout wearing full structural firefighting equipm ent. Again, to do so is nothing short of foolish. In each case, the actions described go aga inst all of the norm al saf ety procedures for the agencies involv ed. A responder who would take the actions described would be a danger to him /herself and certainly not a credit to th e profession . The sa me is true for hazardous m aterials. A responder who does not consider th e six clues of R &I--occupancy/ location, container shape, m arkings and colors, placa rds and labels, shipping papers and MSDS, and senses --places his/her lif e and that of his/her coworkers in danger. TRANSPO RTATION CONTAINERS Hazardous m aterials are transporte d in m any for ms and quantities throughout our country. As a result, ev ery community m ust be prepared to deal with a broad spectrum of trans portation incidents that occur random ly and that can be particularly difficult to handle. However, most situations provide a trem endous num ber of clues for em ergency responders if you know what to look for. SM 5-13 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC for hazardou s materials va ry som ewhat am ong t he five m odes of transportation : highway, rail, water, air, and pipeline. We will look at each briefly. Highw ay Transportation Approxim ately 50 percent of all highway transports carry hazardous materials (not counting the gasoline in their f uel tanks). Th is percen tage may increas e sign ificantly at nigh t when there is less local traf fic. Of those that carry hazardous m aterial s, only 50 percent are required to display placards. For these reasons, highway incidents are comm on and can be difficult to analyze. Many different types of highway transpor t vehic les exis t. The basic typ es include the box trailer, f latbed, dry bulk, van, tank tr ailer, tube trailer, and personal vehicle. Box Trailer Box trailers are one of the m ost common types of vehicles found on the highways. They m ay contain m aterials that fall into one of the f ollowin g hazard class es: flammable various combin ations of these materials. INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Most commonly, a box trailer is f illed with sm aller containers. These containers m ay be cylinders, drums, cardboard or wooden boxes, paper and plastic bags, glass jars , or alm ost any other im aginable type of sm all container. One of the problems with these vehicl es is tha t the true n ature of the problem is hidden by the w alls of the trailer. The approach and/or opening of these trailers can be extrem ely dangerous due to the inability to see what is, or has happened, inside the trailer. Flatbeds most comm only transpor t large obje cts tha t are difficult to loa d on any other type of transport. Thes e objects can be larg e contain ers of hazardous m aterials (all classes). Flatbed Dry bulk units carry solid m aterials in th e form of dusts, powder, pellets, etc. These m aterials can be corrosi ves, oxidizers, and other hazard class material app ropria te for the unit. Dry Bulk SM 5-15 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Vans are very sim ilar in all respects to the box trailer except that instead of a tractor and trailer, the box trailer and tractor are on the sam e frame. Often these units car ry relatively small quantity containers of hazardous materials and do not require placards. Van Tank vehicles pres ent a slightly different situa tion co mpared to the previously m entioned types. In mo st instances, these cargo tankers are intended to ship haza rdous m aterials. As such, they are regulated by the DOT in 49 CFR. A helpf ul way to exam ine tanke rs is to cons ider the m aximum pressure s that should be found in the unit. In highway transportation, there are three bas ic types of tankers with regard to pressure--atm ospheric, low pressure, and high pressure. Atmospheric can have m aximum internal pressures of from 0 to 5 psi. Low pressures can have m aximum in ternal pressures of from 5 to 100 psi. High pressures can have m aximum in ternal pressures of from 100 to 3,000 psi. Atmospheric tankers are used to tra nsport low-v olatility liqu ids (in othe r words, low vapor pr essure). They will hav e an elliptical cross-section al shape and the surfaces of the tank are sm ooth. Common materials transported in tanke rs are gasolin e, diesel fuel, and other liquid fuels. In som e cases, mild poisons and other haza rd-class materials also can be transported in these units. SM 5-16 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND (Low Volat ility Liquids) Low -pressure tan kers handle corrosive and high- volatility liquids. They may have a round or \"horseshoe\" shaped cross-section . The round units have ribs at various points, going around the tank. The horseshoe units have a sm ooth skin. Low Pressure A ND IDENTIFIC ATION High-pres sure tankers have a round cross section but the skin will be smooth. The ends of the unit are hemisp herical. Norm ally, th e maximum pressure is 250 psi. These units will transport products such as liquefied petroleum and other liquefied com pressed gases. As such, they are sus ceptible to Boiling-Liquid, Expanding Vapor Explosions or BLEVE (pronounced blev-ee). High Pressure Special hig h-pressure tankers are unique for two reasons. The first reason is th at the liquefied gases inside them are at temperatu res from -150\u00b0F to below -450 \u00b0F (-101\u00b0 to -2 68\u00b0C). The second reason is that the pressure m ust be reduced to 25 pounds per square inch (psi) or less during the transportation of the product. However, during onloading and of floading, the pressure comm only goes above 100 psi to aid in the transfer process. These units can be round, or round and s quare , depending upon the m anufacturer. Special High-Pressu re (Cryogenics) Tube trailers are nothing m ore than a group of overgrown compress ed gas cylinders attached to a trailer fram e. They contain gases under high pressure. Tube Trailer SM 5-19 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Personal vehicles found on the road s cannot be overlooked. People will often put almost anything that will f it into their vehicles. I n other words, you can find alm ost anything under th e sun in personal vehicles and norm ally you will not kn ow it. What appear to be pr ivate vehicles often are used to transport radioactive pharm aceuticals, v arious industrial chem icals, househo ld-use gases, flammable liquids, flamm able gases, etc. Consider what you have carried in your car or truck. Rail Transportation The prim ary types of railcars are box, flat, hopper, bulk, tank, and tube. In most cases, these cars are similar in use to their co rresponding highw ay counterparts and haul the sam e types of hazardous m aterials, except in larger quantities. The primary exception is the hopper car which is used to haul bulk quant ities of products such as coal. Rail Tank Cars The rail ind ustry class ifies tank cars in two classes: non pressure an d pressure. The term \"nonpressure\" is a m isnom er because no npressure cars can have pressures up to 100 psi. Nonpressure cars carry liquids or solids that can be liquefied by heating for onloading and offloading. The liqui ds can be flammables, corrosives, poisons, oxidizers, etc. The soli ds can b e materials like su lfur, phosphorous, etc. Nonpressure Cars A ND IDENTIFIC ATION All pressure cars can carry liquefied com pressed gas es that m ay be flammable: poisons, oxidi zers, asphyxiants, or a ny com bination of these hazards. Unlike highway transportation, the only good m ethod at the first responder' s level to tell the differe nce between nonpressu re and pressure cars is by the arrangem ent of the at tachm ents found on top of the car. Pressure cars have a large, round de vice on the top referred to as a bonnet , which contains all of the valvi ng assemblies for the car. On th e other hand, nonpressure cars norm ally have several different shaped devices readily visible. All pressure cars are designed to tran sport hazardous m aterials, while not all nonpressure cars are so designed. Again, just like in the cargo tanks, if they are des igned to haul hazardou s materials, the tank car specificatio ns must m eet the DOT regulations found in 49 CFR. Pressure Cars Other Transport Ty pes Water Transport Ships and barges are us ed in water tr ansportation. The primary difference between a ship and a barge is that a ship has its own powerplant, while a barge m ust rely upon a ship for its m ovem ent. SM 5-21 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Either a sh ip or a barge can carry phenom enally large quantities of product, causing trem endous pr oblem s during an incident. Combination Mode Shipments Some types of containers can be tran sported by highway, rail, or water. These containers are referred to as interm odal containers. They m ay be trailers, box-like containers, or a tank supported by a fram e. In rail transport, the con tainers are often affixed to f latcars. In this settin g, they are referred to by s pecial nam es. If the co ntainer is a truck trailer, it is referred to as a tra iler on flatcar, or TOFC. If the con tainer is s imply a large box, it is referred to as a container on flatcar, or COFC. Trailer on a Flat Car (TOFC) INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION Container on a Flat C ar (COFC) Air Transport In air transp ort, the primary carrier is the airp lane. They m ay be dedicated cargo ships or, in a few situations, passe nger service p lanes. In any ev ent, the spec ific requirem ents f or the shipm ent of materials are close ly regulated by DOT in 49 CFR. Generally, the quantities are lim ited to less than 50 pounds even on dedicated cargo transp orts. An ever-presen t hazard with planes is the presence of fuel that is u sed to power the plan e. Pipeline The last mode of transportation is the pipeline. There is scarcely a location in this country that does no t have a pipeline running through the area. These pipelines range from the natur al gas mains in the stree t to massive interstate pipelines that han dle millions of gallons of product each day. SM 5-23 INTRODUCTION TO RECOGNIT ATION Activity 5.1 Recognizing Transportation C ontainers Purpose To practice recognizing container types, uses , hazard classes, and other inform ation.

Fixed facility c ontainers can be classified by their pressure rating in a fashion sim ilar to those found in transportation. However, a new category--ultrahigh pressure--is added. The pressure types: atmospheric-- 0 to 5 psi; low pressure--5 to high pressure--100 to 3,000 psi; and ultrahigh pressure--above 3,000 psi. Atmospheric containers can include all type s such as bags, boxes, drums, or tanks. They contain products th at are liquids or solids under normal conditions. Size can range from extremely sm all to quite large. Configuratio ns vary and multicontai ner packages are common. Many liquid fuel storage tanks, above and belowground, fall into this category. Low -Pressure containers such as storage tanks are designed to contain volatile liquids and solids, and in so me cases, gases (pipelines). Common locations include equipm ent/processing facilities. Only c ertain drums, most of whi ch have pressure reli ef valves, are in this RECOGNIT ION A ND IDENTIFIC ATION High-pres sure containers such as propa ne and other compressed gas cylinders can be found as spheres or cylinders above or belowground. A common exam ple is m edical oxygen cyli nders. High-pressure containers norm ally hold gases, liquids, or pow ders. Ultrahigh-p ressure containers such as tube tanks, pipelines, or cylinders are not common and contain m ostly ga ses and a few liquids. They are usually aboveground and horizontal. Ultrahigh-Pressu re When used as ultrahigh-pressu re containers, these containers are reinforced.Ultrahigh-Pressu re When used as ultrahigh-pressu re containers, these containers are reinforced.

It contains guidance helpful prim arily during the initial phases of a hazardous materials incident. The DOTNAER G wa s designed for use in highway or railroad inc idents, but it will, with certain lim itations, be u seful in other emergency situations. A num bered guide is assigned to each hazard ous m aterial listed in th e index. Each guide provides only th e most vital inf ormation in a br ief practical form , including the m ost sign ificant potential hazards and inform ation concerning recomm ended initial action s. Basic steps for using the gu ide are 1. Identif y the material u sing the product nam e or the f our-d igit ID number on placards or shipping papers. 2. Look up the m aterials' two-digit guide num ber. 3. Turn to and read the numbered guide. The DOTNAERG is an invaluable resource for all first responders. You should be fam iliar with its form at, use, and lim itations in a hazardou s materials incident.

SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP SM 6-2 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP INTRODUCTION Federal reg ulations on hazardous m aterials response co ntain specific mandates describing how the incident will be set up and m anaged. Many of the concepts expres sed in the reg ulations and standards are som ewhat unfamiliar to m any responders. This is true for two reason s. First, un til recen tly, th e specified m anagem ent system has generally been a fire- service system . Second, hazardou s materials scene setup consideratio ns and related concepts are quite dif ferent from m ost routine e mergency response situations. In this un it, we will explore som e of the sim ilarities and differences. Both the O ccupational Safety and Health Adm inistration' s (OSHA) 29 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR ) Part 1910.120 and the Environm ental (EPA) 40 CFR Part 311 state: \"The Senior Emergency Response Official responding to a (chem ical) emergency shall becom e the individual in charge of the Site Sp ecific Incident Command System .\" This m eans that all haz ardous materia ls emergen cy responders must opera te using th e Incident Command System (ICS) . The obvious question is: \"W hat is the Incident C ommand System ?\" The term inology used in this program is that used by the National Fire Academ y (NFA) in its incident comma nd training. This is done strictly for the sake of unifor mity during classr oom delivery. It is recognized that different term inology m ay be used depending on the location or jurisdiction. The particular term inology adopted is not critical, but one unified system must be established in your standard operating procedures (SOP' s). Al l parties m ust use the sam e system and term inology for that system . HISTORY OF THE INCIDENT COMMAND SYST EM In the early 1970' s, Southern Californ ia experienced several devastating wildland fires. The overall cos t and loss asso ciated with the se fires totaled $18 m illion per day. This m ultijuris dictional dis aster was th e impetus for the developm ent of an improved intera gency incident m anagem ent system known as the ICS. ICS is one of the beneficial results of a federally funded project called FIRESCOPE that was convened after these fires, and whose charter was to exam ine various aspects of interagency response to incidents. FIRESCOPE derives its nam e from : FIre RES ources of California Organized for Potential Emergencies. The FIRESCOPE ICS is prim arily a comm and and control system delineating job responsibilities and organizational structure f or the purpos e of m anaging day-to day operations for all types of em ergency incidents. W hile originally developed f or SM 6-3 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP wildland incidents it was f ound that the system could be applied easily to day-to-day f ire and rescue operations. It also is flexible enough to m anage catastrophic incidents involving thousands of emergency response and manage ment personnel. The National Inter-Agency Incident Managem ent System (NIIMS) is another system using ICS that was developed by the wildland comm unity in order to provide a common system for wildland fire protection agencies at the local, State, and Federal levels. The NIIMS organization includes the Bureau of Land Managem ent, the Bu reau o f Indian Affairs, the U. S. Fish and W ildlife Servic e, the U.S. Fore st Serv ice, represen tatives of State Foresters, and the National Park S ervice. NIIMS consists of five m ajor subsystem s that collectively prov ide a to tal s ystem s approach to ris k manage ment: The ICS which includes operating re quirem ents, eight interactive components, and procedures fo r organizing and operating an onscene m anagem ent structure. Training that is standardized a nd supports the effective operations of NIIMS. A qualification and certification system that provides personnel across the N ation with standard tr aining, experience, and physical requir ements to f ill sp ecific position s in the ICS. Publications m anagem ent that in cludes developm ent, publication, and distribution of NIIMS m aterials. Supporting technologies such as orthophoto m apping, photography , and a m ultiagency coo rdination sy stem that supports NIIMS operations. Since the developm ent of the ICS, the fire service has experienced several challenges in understanding its applicati on. As a result, in consistencies in the system began to develop; other hybrid system s came into existence, further distancing a common appr oach to incident comm and. A single incident m anagem ent system is criti cal for effective comm and and control of m ajor incidents. At these incident s, a single departm ent m ay interface with other agencies on the local, State, and Federa l level. In order to reduce the inherent confusion that m ay be associated with larger s cale incidents, using a common command system is a m ust. Recognizing the challenges that w ere occurring in the fire service in applying a common approach to in cident command, the National F ire Service Incident Managem ent System Consortium was created. Developed SM 6-4 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP in 1990, its purpose is to evaluate an approach to developing a single Comm and s ystem . The Consortium c onsists of m any individual fire servic e leaders, rep resentatives of most m ajor fire serv ice organiz ations, and representatives of Federal agenci es including FIRESCOPE. One of the significant outcom es of the wo rk done by the Consortium was the identificatio n of the need to develop operational protocols w ithin ICS, so that fire and rescue personnel would be able to apply the ICS as one common system . In 1993, as a result of this, the IMS Consortium completed its f irst doc ument: Model Procedures Guide for Structural Firefighting. FIRESCOPE adopted this in pr inciple as an application to the Model F IRESCOPE ICS. The basic pr emise is that the o rganiz ational structure found in the FIRESCOPE ICS now is enhanced with operational protoco ls that allow th e Nation' s fire and rescue personnel to apply the ICS effectively regardless of what area in the count ry they are assigned. The NFA, having adopted the F IRESC OPE ICS in 1980, has incorporate d this m aterial in its training curric ulum and will continue to reach th e thousands of fire service personnel with one common incident comm and and control system . It is im portant to no te that th e FIRESCOPE Model ICS has had other applications or m odules similar to th e structural firefighting applications that hav e been in place for som e time. These create a fram ework for other activ ities to operate in a nd further enhance the use of ICS. As an example, there are the Multi-Casualty, Hazar dous Material, and the Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) applications. The Federal Em ergency Managem ent Agency (FEMA) form ally adopted FIRESCOPE ICS as the incident m anage ment system for any Federal response required by the agency. Since then, several other Federal agencies have adopted FIRESCOPE ICS. Need for a Comprehensive System Throughout the coun try, multiagency or multijurisdictional disasters led to the developm ent of i mproved interagency incident m anagem ent capabilities that could be used at m ajor incid ents. All agencies recogn ized the advantage of combining resour ces under a comm on organizational structure. They also recognized th at this system should not be f or multiagency , major emergenc ies o nly, but should be a day-to-da y operational system for each agency . The ICS requires mutual agreem ent and/or acceptan ce of: 1) organizational structure, 2) comm on operating procedures, 3) comm on terminology, and 4) personnel qualifications (trained in the system ). Such a system represents a giant s tep not only for t he fire servi ce but for SM 6-5 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP emergency response in general. It allows the coordinated use of personnel from many different agencies to operate as a single unit. In other words, the ICS provides a un iform national em ergency incident manage ment capability. To ensure proper incident m anage ment through coordi nation of overall operations, a responsive or ganization m ust be developed. T he IC m ust be able to co mmunicate effectively with in the organization and to assess feedback from all involved in the in cident. The use of a specific command structure and term inology is vital to the m anagem ent of the system . Because hazardous m aterials in ciden ts, like m ost incid ents, are dynam ic, frequent shifts within the plan of action can be anticipated. The ICS provides an effective and efficient system that is capab le of managing even the most com plex s ituation with a gre at degree of flexibility, control, and reliability. Advantages of the Incident Command System Expandability --An all-hazards incident managem ent system can be readily adapted to the incident. The ICS is expandable from routine to complex incidents. The person in charge, the Incident Commander (IC), may be an engine company lieutenant, captain, the chief of the departm ent, a police officer, the comm issioner, an advanced first aider, or a param edic supervisor. Commonalities in organization, term inology, procedures, and qualifications--The ICS provides a comm on fram ework under which different ag encies and discip lines can function effectively during an emergency. Established roles a nd procedures al so f acilita te interorgan izationa l comm unications and planning. Unified Command --A key attribute of ICS is the unity of purpose and command available through shared and defined responsibilities. Single Versus Unified Command In a single comm and situation, only one agency has legal responsibility. Hazardous m aterials in cidents, m ass casualty incidents, natural disasters, or wildland fires, am ong others, m ay involve a number of jurisdictions and/or ag encies that hav e a legal or f unctional need to be involved directly in the decisionm aking process. The worst thing that can happen is to allow each of these responsible ag encies to establish a C ommand Post (CP) of its own, separate a nd distinct from the others. In th is instan ce, it is critical that there be a Unified Command. SM 6-6 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP What Cues the Need for a Unified Command? More than one agency responsib le for decisionm aking within a single jurisdiction. Exam ple: A passenger airline crash within a national f orest. Local fire, local m edical, Federal fore stry, and National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are all involved. More than o ne jurisdiction is invo lved. Exam ple: A m ajor flood, hurricane, etc. All agencies with responsib ility to m anage the inci dent contribute to the Comm and process. Together they de termine overall inc ident objec tives and strategies, and plan tactics join tly. This m ethod ensures the m aximum use of assigned resources. The location of the incid ent.

Depending on the type of incident, someone m ust determ ine which agen cies ac tually have It is SM 6-7 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP important to recognize prior traini ng and experience when staffing the Unified Command Post and Operations function. Single/Unified Command Differences In Single Comm and structure, a sing le IC is solely responsible for manage ment strategy of the incident. In a Single Comm and structure, the implem entation of strategy and tactics to achieve op erational cont rol is the responsibility of one person--the Operations Section Chief. In a Unified Comma nd structure, individuals designated by involved jurisdictions/departm ents jointly determ ine objectives, strategy, and priorities. The determination of which juri sdiction/agen cy the Operation s Section Chief represents m ust be made by m utual agreem ent of the Unified Command.

As the size of the incident increases, so does the need for personnel, resources, notifications, tim e expe nditures, etc. For this reason, estab lishm ent of a relatively un iform set of incident level designations can assist em ergency responders greatly in predeterm ining the needs of th e incident. Inciden t leveling sys tems are used in many types of e mergency response situa tions : Emergency m edical services identify various levels of disasters based on the num ber of victim s and the seve rity of the injur ies. The fire service uses alarm s to request m ore personnel and resources and to identify speci fic notification needs. Nuclear po wer facilities use four levels of em ergencies depending on the severity of the problem . All of these system s have one thing in common: they te ll others with in the response system , at least to a degree, what to expect. They provide specific predesignated inform ation about the incident and proper responses, including m agnitude, complex ity, notification, resource needs, staffing requirem ents, etc. No specific num ber of levels is requi red. Some source s such as the National Fire Protection Asso ciation (NFPA) Standard 471, Recommended Practice for Responding to Hazardous Materials Incidents, list th ree, while other sources list four. W hatever system is chosen is basica lly up to the loca lity. The f ollowing provid es one example of an incident leveling system . Level I Level I is a routine emergency co ndition . Such situations norm ally can be controlled by first responders due to the s mall m agnitude of the inciden t and the m inimal degree of the hazard. No evacuation is indicated other than the iso lation of the imm ediate inc ident a rea. The inc ident is confined to a sm all geo graphic area. Full protective equipm ent (turnouts) is adequate for response. Organizations typically involved coul d include a fire brigade, fire departm ent, security, law enforcement, EMS, the Chem ical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC), State environm ental agency, or others.

SM 6-33 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP SM 6-34 SITE M ANAGEMENT AND SCENE SETUP SCENE SETUP A basic approach used f or the protec tion of responders and the public at hazardous m aterials in cidents i nvolves th e establishm ent of zones and perimeters . These designated areas are de signed to help responders deny entry into th e hazard area a nd initiate evacuation . A zone is a defined area whose peri meter is its outer boundary. This principle is common i n emergency response; other examples include collapse zones (firefighting) and line-of -fire zones (law enforcem ent). In both cases, zones are designed to protect responders and others. The basic approach for setting up hazardo us m aterials zones and perim eters is to es tablis h three dis tinct areas of dim inishing hazard : the hot, warm , and cold zones. Figure 6-5 Basic Scene Setup Hot Zone The hot zone has the highest degree of hazard. This zone is closest to the actual incident location and m ust be considered by fi rst responders as extrem ely dangerous and possibly life threatening. E verything and everyone currently in or later entering the hot zone is considered to be contam inated. Everything and everyone contam inated m ust be decontamin ated before leaving.

Warm Zone The warm zone is an interm ediate zone between the hot (very dangerous) and cold (relatively safe) zones. Th is zone contains the access points and decontam ination corridor through whic h more highly trained and equipped personnel w ill enter the hot zone. Although a lesser degree of hazard is associated with the warm zone, specific levels of knowledge and protection are needed by anyone entering this are a. Since the dec ontam inatio n corridor will becom e contam inated to som e degree where more highly trained and equipped personnel enter the hot zone, first responders without adequate training and equipm ent shall not en ter the w arm z one either !

For the firefighter, this generally means turnout gear. Param edics m ay think about latex gloves, splash protection, and adjunctive airway equipm ent. Police use firearm s, nightsticks, and bulletproof vests. All are PPE for different purposes and situations. PPE provides protection from three b asic types of hazards : mechanical--physical protection; therm chem protection. Therm al and chem ical protection can be further divided into body and respiratory protection, depending prim arily on the type of m aterial used and the availability of positiv e-pressure self -contained bre athing appara tus (SCBA). The m atrices on the next page summarize the protective capabilities of the m ajor ca tegor ies of PPE and chem ical pro tective equipm ent (CPE) which are discussed below. CATEGORIES OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Structural Firefighting Equipment PPE used by firefighters for structur al firefighting is known as \"bunker gear,\" \"turnout gear,\" or by other nam es. Firefighters' PPE include a hood, helm et, coat, gloves, pants, boots, Pe rsonal Alert Safety S ystem (PASS) device, and positiv e-pressure SCBA. Turnout equipm ent is designed to cover the body and the respiratory system totally. It provides a high level of protection against physical injury and lim ited, short- term protection against heat and toxic atmospheres; it is not designed for di rect fire entry. High levels of respiratory protection, both therm al and chem ical, are provided by positiv e-pressure SCBA. Any use of respiratory protective equipm ent requires that personnel receive an initial training program in its proper use, care, and handling. This tr ainin g must include f it testing and subsequent certification of the user. The fit test ensures that th e equipm ent does not l eak. Additionally, there m ust be routin e followup tr aining and use of the equipm ent to maintain competency.

Training requirem ents are found in 29 Code of Federal Regulatio ns (CFR) 1910 and NFPA 1500. An NFPA publication excerpt is included in Appendix C. While \"turnout gear\" or \"bunker g ear\" is intended for structural firefighting, it is not fireproof. It is not designed for fi re entry. NFPA 1971, Standard on Protective Ensemble Fo r Structural Fire Fighting states that structu ral firefightin g equipm ent shall be capable of withstanding heat of 1,500\u00baF (816\u00baC) for 15 seconds. This m eans that in the event of high heat, as in a flashover, it will pr otect you for a short time while you get out. Proximity and Entr y Suits Therm al-resistant clothing and equi pment includes prox imity suits a nd entry su its. Proximity (or approach) suits are designed to withstand high temperatures for a lim ited period of tim e. It is important to note th at the se are not firep roof suits an d are not designed for fire entry rescue. They are used for firefighting in areas prim arily involving flammable or combustible liquids. Proxim ity suits provide little body protection against mechanical and chem ical injury, but high levels of therm al protection. Respiratory protection, both therm al and chemical, is hig h because of the use of positiv e-pressure SCBA. Entry suits are designed to perform critical functions that require lim ited direc t flame contac t. Even thes e suits no rmally are lim ited in the amount of time direct flam e contact is perm itted--from 30 to 60 seconds over the lifetime of the suit. Entry suits provide protection sim ilar to proxim ity suits; however, therm al body protection is even higher. Th ey provide a low level of body protection from chemicals, yet a high le vel of respiratory protection due to use of positive-pressure SCBA. Chemical Protective Equipmen t CPE is special clothing designed to prot ect the wearer in ch emical or to xic environm ents. The Environm ental Pro tection Agency (EPA) has established f our levels of pr otection: A, B, C, and D. Level A is the highest level of chem ical protection. A full coverage suit with positiv e-pres sure SCBA inside or outside the su it is worn when there SM 7-5 PERSON AL PROTECTIVE E QUIPMENT is danger of absorbing chem icals through the skin. However, this type of equipm ent provides virtually no m echanical or therm al body protection. Level B protection provides increased body protection, usually in the form of a splash suit e ither designed in a one-piece full coverage garm ent or a two-piece design. A positiv e-pressure SCBA is required for respirato ry protection. Special chem ical gloves are used with Level B protection. Leather gloves should not be used si nce they absorb chem icals and cannot be decontam inated. Level B doe s not provide protection against chem icals that are absorbed through the skin, such as certain poisons. Level C CPE provides lim ited body and re spiratory protection. Body protection is in the for m of overalls or splash suits. Respiratory protection is in the f orm of an air- purif ying re spira tor, which is inef fective in m any atmospheres and should not be used during the em ergency response phase of an incident. Level C is not ap propriate for th e first respo nder. Level D protective equipm ent is the le vel of least protection. It is generally work clothes w ithout respiratory protection. As such, Level D provides som e minimal mechanical, a nd even chem ical protection, but no therm al or respiratory protection. A wide variety of m aterials are used to m anufacture CPE. Care m ust be taken when choosing the m aterial for any level of CPE. Chem icals can attack and destroy CPE if the mater ials are not com patible with the chem icals o n the s cene. Before a su it is cho sen, the chem ical in ques tion must be positiv ely iden tified and its characteristics fully understood. All components of the CPE m ust be compa tible with the chemical--not just the suit, but the gloves, b oots, and facepiece. Two questions need to be asked wh en CPE is need ed: W hat is the appropriate level of protection (A, B , C, or D)? What m aterial (n eopren e, butyl rubber, Teflon\u00ae, etc.) should be used for the CPE? Assistance in this process can be obtained from Chemical Transportation Em ergency Center (CHEMTREC) or the ch emical m anufacturer. LIMITATIONS OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT Several lim itations m ust be considered when using all form s of PPE. Persons wearing PPE usually experience a loss of p hysical dexterity a nd mobilit y. A responder cannot m ove ea sily in protective clothing. The loss become s more severe as the level of protection increas es. To com bat this problem the wearer must be well trained in the proper donning , wearing, and doffing of all PPE. Careful planning of the job at hand is also im portant. It m ay take m uch longer than anticipated if PPE are worn. SM 7-6 PERSON AL PROTECTIVE E QUIPMENT Reduced dexter ity and mobility als o increase s tress, both physical and m ental. Careful m onitoring of medical vital signs before and after use of PPE is critical. To tal tim e in PPE also shou ld be monitored closely. A rest and recuperation (R&R) area should be designated away from the scene, and tim e in the R&R area should be m andatory. Signs and sym ptoms of heat s tress and possible heat exhaustion should be m onitored. T his should be done even if it is not a war m day. PPE can get very warm inside, becau se, as the hazardous environm ent is being kept out , body heat is being kept in. Heat stress results from the body' s inability to cool itself through the norm al perspiration and eva poration process. The four progressively serious levels of heat stress are heat rash, heat c ramp, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. Replenishm ent of body fluids is very im portant. W ater or an el ectrolyte replenishm ent should be available. Vision is limited when PPE is worn. There is also a ch ance that facepieces m ay fog. Communic ation is affected when wearing SCBA and PPE because the facepiece ob structs th e mouth. It is very im portant for responders, es pecially those wearing PPE, to keep physically fit. Em ergency response work is usually very difficult, and it is even m ore physically dem anding when wearing PPE. NFPA 1500 provides guidance on establishing a nd m aintaining a ph ysica l fitness program . The care and m aintenance of PPE is extrem ely im portant--a responder' s life m ay depend on it. T he care and m aintenance program should include regular (daily, weekly , monthly, and yearly) inspections. Visual inspection o ften can catch a problem be fore it gets too big. Keeping the equipm ent clean and s tored proper ly will he lp pre vent dam age. Testing and recertification should be done to equipm ent manufacturers' specification s. Careful records should be kept on all m aintenance and recertification activities. The person respons ible for establishing such a program should consult the m anufacturers for assistance. The program should be written down in the form of standard operating procedures (SOP' s) and adhered to carefully. SM 7-7 PERSON AL PROTECTIVE E QUIPMENT First Responder Uses of Haz Mat Personal Protectiv e Equipment In general, first respond ers will not have access to specialized therm al or chem ical protective equ ipment. Use of this type of equipm ent requires special train ing, both in hazardous m aterials an d in proper techniqu es for selection, m aintenance, storage, and use. In short, firs t responders should not be using therm al or chem ical protective equipm ent under any circum stances. First respon ders generally will be in limited firefighting tu rnout gear or norm al wor k clothes. At the first responder level, this equipm ent is adequate because these personnel should be acting prim arily in a defensive mode. However, properly trained personnel m ay use turnouts for limite d contro l activ ities.

Descri be how cross -contamination occ urs an d the ass ociated dangers. 4. Identify specific steps t hat must be t aken to prevent contamination of responde definitions for dec ontam inatio n are in widespread us e today: The Occupational Sa fety and He alth Admin istration (OSHA) defines decontam inatio n as \"the removal of hazardous sub stances from employees and their equipm ent, to the extent n ecessary, to preclud e foreseeab le health effects.\" ination as the \"physical and/or chem ical process of reducing or preventing the spread of contam ination from persons and/or equipm ent.\" When com pared, both d efinition s address a s lightly dif ferent focus a nd meaning of the term . For the purpose of this course, decontam ination will be defined as a \" chemical o r physical process used to remove an d prevent the spread of contaminan ts from an emergency scene due to their ability to cause ha rm to livi ng beings and/or the environment .\" In other words, decontam ination is th e process of rem oving or chem ically changing a contam inant to prevent its spread an d elim inate the possibility of exposure to others. A contaminant is any chem ical or biological agent that is capable of caus ing harm to people, other form s of life, or the environm ent. The si mple fact that a contam inant is capable of har ming people and other living things is the exact reaso n why it m ust be rem oved from people or equipm ent. Concepts of Decontamination Decontam ination is likely to be requi red whenever chem icals are involved in an incident. This is true even if contamination is not apparent . This rais es an inter esting question: \"Must everyone on a ha z mat incident scene undergo decontam ination?\" The answer is a qualif ied no! If the incident scene has been set up with zones following appropriate standard operating procedures (S OP's), and no one has entered the hot zone, there should be no need to decontam inate anyone. Decontam ination m ust be conducted if: The incident is not zoned appropriately. There has been a change in the incident status. SM 8-3 DECONT AMINATION Personnel have entered the hot zone. Victim s were found in the hot zone. Regarding decontam ination, these f undam ental points m ust be stressed Anything or anyone entering the hot z one is considered to be contaminated and mus t be deco ntaminated before leavin g that zone . This includes responders, victim s, onlookers, and equipm ent. The best approach to decont amination is to PREVENT contamination in the first place. How is contam ination prevented ? By f ollowing established SOP's, includ ing se tting up zo nes, denyin g entry, and isolating the imm ediate area. By ap proaching f rom uphill a nd upwind and staying out of visible product. In fact, all resp onders should stay out of the hot zone com pletely unless adequately trained and appr opriately equipped. Following these simple procedures can m ake a great difference in the m agnitude of the decontam ination problem. Methods of Contamination During the initial response phase, emergency services personnel sometimes approach the scene from the wrong d irection (from downhill or downwind) or approach too closely w ithout realizing that the incident involves hazardous m aterials. They often demonstrate tunnel vision in their rush to aid a victim or to assess the situatio n. As a result, personn el, vehicles, and equipm ent becom e contam inated. The contam ination may be the result of driving or walking through released toxic materials found on the ground or by breathing air contam inated by dusts, powders, gases, or vapors. At this point, the resp onder becomes the victim, frequently without even knowing it. There are two ways in w hich responders can becom e contaminated : direct and cross-contam ination. Direct con tamination occurs when a person or an object enters the hot zone (before or after it has been es tablished o fficially) an d com es into direct con tact with the released substance (contam inant). W henever personnel or bystanders com e too close to the actual incident scene, the potential for direct contam ination contam inated p erson or object. Re member: Cross-contamination, by definition, occurs whenever a victim, responder, or equi pment that has been in the hot zone is touched prior to being decontaminated! It is vital not to underestim ate the pot ential harm of cross-contam ination. Many incidents have been com pounded when contam inated victim s wer e transported to m edical facilities w ithout undergoing decontam ination. In those situations, the trail of cross-co ntam ination led f rom the scene to th e medic unit and its equ ipment, to th e medics, to the em ergency room and its equipm ent, and to em ergency room personnel. The im pact can be staggering. Cross- contam ination has led to the deaths of m edics, em ergency room personnel, and even e mergency responders' family m a poss ibly sm all, easily managed situation to a large, com plex, and tra gic dis aster with m ultiple victim s. The best w ay to prevent responder c ontam ination is to follow the basic scene setup and control procedur es ou tlined pr eviously. Identify the level of incident involved, ins titute the in cident comm and system, isolate and evacuate (where possib le) the immediate area, request as sistan ce, an d provide infor mation. Reme mber, the best w ay to han dle decontamin ation is to prevent contamination in the firs t place. Phases of Decontamination The decontam ination procedures descri bed below require specific training and expertise to perform. This particular discussion is not to imply that first respo nders are capable of perfo rming decontamination procedures , nor to provide the necessary skil ls, but is designed to give an idea of what is involved in the process . The decontam ination process involves two specific phases: 1. decontam ination. 2. Secondary decontam ination. Gross deco ntaminat ion, as the nam e implies, is the process of re moving or chem ically altering gross contam inants found on a person or object. Simply stated, gross con taminants ar e nothing m ore than the m ajor portion of the contam commonly, rem oval of only surface contam inants, and not necessarily all of the contam inations. This m eans that even after going through the pro cess of gross decontam ination, some amount of c ontam ination will remain. This fac t should m ake it obvious that a need exists for another round of decontam ination, known as secondary decontam ination. Secondary decontamin ation is the rem oval or chem ical altering of most if not all of the residual contamina nt left on the person or object. Again, this im plies that before undergoing secondary decontam ination, som e contam ination still is present. In any even t, the two ph ases of deco ntam ination apply to both people and equipm ent. It is vital to rem ember that if people or equipment have only undergone the gross decontam ination phase, the process has not been completed. As a resu lt, there is the potential for cross-contam ination and all of the associated problem s. TYPE S OF DECONT AMINATION Depending on the incident situation, people , equipment , and/or the environmen t may require som e degree of decontam ination. Again, anyone or anything that is in or enters th e hot zone m ust be decontam inated before leaving that zone. Normally, response personnel are only involved in decontam ination of people and, to a lesser degree, equipm ent. In m ost locations, environmen tal deconta mination (cleanup) is not the job of respons e personnel . One exception to this general rule is an indus trial Em ergency Response Team (ERT). Routinely, ERT' s conduct a specific degree of environm ental deconta mination on the grou nds of their own f acility. However, most ERT' s defer the cleanup of larger release situations to contractors that specialize in environm ental cleanup. An im portant poin t is that no t all things that are contam inated can be readily decontam inated. For the case of environm ental decontam ination, contaminated soil mo st often cannot be decontam inated and m ust be excavated and disposed of as hazard ous waste. Many other m aterials also are extrem ely diffic ult, if not impossible, to decontam inate, depending on the sp ecific chem ical involved. Exam ples of such m aterials include leather goods (alm ost always impossible to decon); street clothing; rubber m aterials, (including m oney) and som e plastic products; carpeting, such as that found in vehicles; drug boxes; electronic equipm ent; and blankets, sheets, towels. Materials th at canno t be decontam inated m ust be approp riately pack aged (over-packed, drummed, bagged, etc.), to prevent cros s-contam inatio n. Then they must be disposed of, sin ce they have becom e hazardous waste. Proper procedures m ust be followed for packaging, transport, and disposal. Personnel Decontamination People are the prim ary focus of e mergency response decontam ination. Individuals who require decontam ination fall into two prim ary catego ries: 1. Protected persons. 2. Unprotected victim s. Protected means that potential victim s were pr otected by an appropriate type of personal protective equipm ent (PPE). As a re sult, they did n ot receive direct body contact with the contam inant. Unprotected means that individuals were not protected by appropriate levels of PPE. In this situation, the individual may receive direct body contact with the contam inant. Obvi ously, such a situ ation potentially holds dire health im plicati ons for the unprotected person. In general, the only persons wh o fall in to th e protected category of contam inated people are em ergency responders who wea r appropriate PPE. All other contaminated pers ons, whether responders or the public, are classified as unprotected and must be considered victims of the incident. It is hoped that the full im plications of this statem ent are clear. Specifically, response personnel w ho are not equipped with adequate PPE--such as law enforcem ent, Em ergency Medical Services (E MS), public work s, secur ity, etc.,- -or tho se who have the equipment but do not use it, will be consider ed victims if they en ter th e hot zone. Additionally, if such personnel arrive first on the scene and do not establish a large enough perim eter, they are responders about to becom e victim 8-7 tial dangers o f chem ical exposure and the resulting contam ination often are not obvious or easily proven. As a result, all incidents involving chemicals must be considered capable of causing exposure and contamin ation until information proving otherw ise is obtained. Remember, a contaminated responder is jus t another victim to be managed during a chemica l incident! Protected Person Decontamination Two-step decontam ination for protecte d persons is by far the easiest and least tim e-consum ing t ype of decont aminatio n. This statem ent is not intended to imply that the decon tamination process is easy and quick. Rather, it in dicates that decontam ination of unprotected persons is quite difficult. Gross deco ntaminat ion for a protected person invol ves a series of steps. These steps include alternating wash es and rinses of the barrier provided by the protective equipm ent worn by the re sponder. This series of washes and rinses is intended specifically to rem ove enough contam ination to allow wearers to rem ove clothing without becom ing cross- contam discussion addresses a maximu m decontam ination setup. Normally, the process starts in the hot zone with a gross wash. This initial wash is f ollowed by entry in to the decontam ination cor ridor and the warm zone, where a series of two washes a nd two rinses takes place. Once the washes and rinses are co mpleted, th e protective equipm ent is rem oved. Secondary decontamin ation starts at this point. The individual leaves the decontam ination corridor and warm zone and enters the cold zone. The first step is to remove neces sary cloth ing and wash at leas t the exposed skin. This step m ay require th e individual to re move all clothing and take a full shower, depending upon the exact chem ical and the situation. From here, the individual puts on clean clothing (often disposable paper) and goes for medical monitoring . In this step, the physical condition of the person is assessed to ensure that no apparent m edical problem s exist. At first, it m ay appear that th e process just outlin ed is excessiv e or impossible to accom plish. Nothing can be further from the tru th. Granted, no t all of thes e steps are necessa ry in all situations, but first responders norm ally do not have the inform ation, knowledge, or SM 8-8 DECONT AMINATION experience n eeded determ ine steps can b e elim inated. As a resu lt, the responder m ust be prepared to participate in the m aximum decontam ination process. Contaminated Victim Decontamination The unprotected person m ust undergo the same phases of decontam ination, but the si tuation is quite different and often trickier. There are several reasons why it is difficult to decontam inate unprotected persons (victim decontam ination). First , most people equate chem ical contam ination with pain or severe discomfort. An exam ple would be burns by contam ination of the skin with an acid. Unfo rtunately, such imme diately apparent symptoms often are not present. Many chem icals have substantial latency periods. Latency, the de lay between the tim e of exposure to the contam inant and the tim e when sym ptoms develo p, can range anywhere from minut es to hours, days, or even y ears. As a result, a person who receives an exposure may not realize an exposure has occurred. W hen this t ype of contam inated victim is instructed to go through a d econtam ination process, an uncooperative response can be anticipated. Second , since th e ind ividual is no t protected, exposure can be both internal and external . Alm ost without exception, victim decontam ination will address only external contam ination. The same is true , even in a health -care facility. The only exception may be for certain types of ingestion route exposures. Third , as long as the contam inant is in contact, the victim experiences ongoing chemical attack . In ess ence, th e chemical exposure no rmally will take precedence over any other medical problem exhibited by the victim . Rem ember, until decontamin ation is co mpleted, ongoing che mical attack will occur . Finally , because these people are victim s, a strong likelihood exists that they m ay not be am bulat ory (able to move them selves). Obviously, a nonam bulatory victim requiring decont amination is a major diffic ulty. Ambulatory contam inated victim s have a tendency to leave the hot zone or perim eter. I f the conta minant causes pain o r discom fort, the victim may actually \"rush\" the responders. This action risks cross-contam inating the responders, their vehicles, a nd expanding the hot zone. SM 8-9 DECONT AMINATION Such a mbulatory victim s must be ordere d to s tay at the pe rimeter or the edge of the hot zone if it has been established. The use of bullhorns or a PA syste m may be required. The vict ims should be told why they must not approach responders and what is going to be done for them . The y need to know what actions are being taken to establish decontam ination and what they are to do. In any event, both gross and secondary decontam ination m ust be perform ed on these victim s. Nor mally, we s ee gross decontam ination taking p lace the f ield with s econ dary decontam ination taking place at the health -care faci lity. It is im perative to note that prior to transport of a contamin ated victim, decontamination must occur . Gross decontam ination of a victim is rather straightforward, but you m ust remember that during the process of decontam ination, the potential for cross-contam ination always exists. Because of cross-contam ination, personnel perform ing victim dec ontam ination or any associated emergency m edical personnel must be protected by appropriate PP E! If protective equipm ent is not w orn, the personnel perfor ming the decontam ination will becom e contaminated v ictims as well! Two primary steps are involved in victim decontam ination. One is the removal of contam inated clothing and the other is the flushing of the victim with large quantities of water for a m inimum of 15 m inutes. Although both of these steps sound rath er straightforward, there are m any considerations involved in their im plem entation. Removing Clothing It is of ten very dif ficult to de termine if and exactly where clo thing is contam inated. As a result, it is better to remove m ore clothing than initially m ay appear necessary. Rem ember, contam inated clothing left in place will allow the co ntam inant to contact th e body and continue the chem ical attack. Another im portan t con sidera tion is the protection and modesty of the victim . Attem pts should be m ade to shield the victim from weather conditions and public onlookers. T his shielding should not com promise the safety of the victim or the decon personnel by allowing extended contact with the contam inant. Flushing with Water The rem oval of contaminated clothing norm ally is followed by rinsing with re latively large quantities of water for a m inimum of 15 to 20 minutes. This particular subject is an area of som e controversy. Many SM 8-10 DECONT AMINATION believe that in any situation, includi ng water-reactive chem icals, flushing with water is an absolutely essential part of decontam ination. Others disagree. It is im portant to rem ember that local protocol m ust be considered when perform ing decontam ination procedures. In any event, w henever flush ing of contaminants is p erformed, the runoff must be containe d for furth er eva luatio n. In m ost instances, the runof f water will conta in contam inants and must be held and proper ly disposed of after the flushing process. Secondary victim dec ontam ination norm ally occurs at a health-care facility. Som e location s have desi gnated and engineered receiving a reas for contam inated victim s. In others, secondary decontam ination occurs outside the building itself. In any event, plan ning m ust take place to identify the capabilities of local heal th-ca re facilities and the requir ements of specific local protocols. Transporting Victims Since gross decon occurs in the fiel d, and secondary decon occurs at the health -care facility, an o bvious m issing step is trans porta tion. In the c ase of contam inated victim s, transportati on from the scene to the health -care facility creates som e unique problem s and requires som e special procedures. First , no victim is t ransported wi thout first undergoing gross decontamin ation . The reasons should be obvious by now: continued chem ical attack on the victim and inevitable cross- contam ination. Second , the health-care facil ity must be no tified as soon as possible that a contam inated victim is coming, the product(s) involved, and any other pertinent in form ation. Early notification is vital becaus e most health-care facil ities require 15 to 30 m inutes to have the needed personnel, equi pment, and supplies ready. The local or regional Poison Control Ce nter also should be notified to provide specific data on stabili zation, treatm ent, decontam ination, etc. Third , the victim must be packaged to prevent cross- contam ination from the residuals th at rem ain. Packaging norm ally involves wrapping the victim in wa rm, absorbent m aterial (such as a disposable blanket) and then c overing this lay er with a plastic material. This plastic m aterial can range from sheeting to a body bag. The covering should allow the victim to m aintain an airway, SM 8-11 DECONT AMINATION IV's, and vitals. (In other word s, do not zip the body bag all the way up.) Fourth , the transport unit and crew must be prepared. Norm ally, all nonessential equipm ent m ust be removed from the unit and the interior draped with plastic sheeting. The dr aping should cover the floor and any other exposed surf aces. The crew also m ust determ ine what types of personal protective equipm ent m ay be needed. Specific atten tion m ust be paid to respiratory, hand, skin, and face pro tection. Finally , it is imperative f or the trans port c rew to bring any and all product-specific inform ation to the health-care facility. This inform ation should include product na me(s), Material Safety Data Sheets (MS DS's), UN bers, Chem ical Abstrac bers other pertinent information. Decontamination/Access Corridors A decontam ination corridor m ust be established before trained and protected personnel enter the hot zone. The reas on is sim ple: before anyone can leave the hot z one, he/she must be decontaminated . If the decontam ination corridor is not establis hed prior to entry into the hot zone, there is no safe way anyone , even in an emergency, can leave the hot zone. The graphic on the next page pr ovides an overview of a m odel decontam ination cor ridor. Som e specif ics to con sider a re the location of the z one perimeters --hot zone perim eter, w arm and decontam ination corridor perim eters. The relationship of the access and decontamination corridors also is im portant. In essence, each corrido r is one-w ay. Personnel enter the hot zone only through the access corridor and leav e only through the decontam ination CORR IDORCOLD ZONE 1st 1st 2nd 2nd Desuiting WASH RINSE WASH RINSE Hand & Face Wash Medical Monitori ng & RedressGlove Wash Oute r Bootie & Glove Drop Tool & Equipm ent DropAbsorbent Pad Overpack o r DisposalMedical Monitor ing & Suiting HOT ZON EACCESS CO RRIDOR DECO NTAMINATION CORR 1st1st 2nd2nd 2nd Desuiting WASH RINSE WASH RINSE WASH RINSE Hand & Face Wash Medical Monitori ng & RedressGlove Wash Oute r Bootie & Glove Drop Tool & Equipm ent DropAbsorbent Pad Overpack o r DisposalMedical Monitor ing & Suiting Figure 8-1 Access an d Decontamination S etup The exact size of the co rrido rs genera lly depends on the number of steps that are n eeded to accomplish d econt amination. Under the conditions seen in the graph ic, the dis tance from the hot zone perim eter to the war m zone perim eter norm ally would range from 35 to 50 feet. The decontam ination corridor would be 18 to 30 feet wide. The access corridor would be 10 to 25 feet wide. The decontam ination corridor has va rious stations where different activ ities ta ke plac e. Special attention should be given to wash/rinse locations an d absorbents that are pr ovided to stop runoff. It is also important to note tha t the entire decontam ination corridor is covered with plastic sheeting. In any event, decontam ination must take p lace in a d esignated a rea following specific, designated procedures. A maximum layout for gross decontam ination norm ally would include the following: tool and equipm ent drop; glove redres s; and medical m onitoring. The specific steps and procedures that are followed depend upon m any variables such as the ex act product involved, the type of PPE worn, the type of contam ination, and so on. Each organization involved m ust determ ine and develop SOP' s to address its ow n needs and resources. If the capability to perform appropriate decontam ination for a specific typ e of operation does not exist, then that operation sh ould not be performed! Again, first responders do not have the level of training needed to perform decontamination procedures. SOURCES OF INFORMATION When it com es to an actual incident , product-specific inform ation about decontam ination m ay or may not be readily ava ilable.

RESOURCES SM 9-2 RESOURCES INTRODUCTION Broadly defined, resources are people and m aterials that you can turn to for support or help. They include people, supplies, equipment, inform ation, funding--anything you can use in a hazardous m aterials emergency. But one characteristic is critical: resources m ust be readily available to draw upon when needed. This unit describes categories of res ources, which are im portant to you as a first responder. It discusses ways you can identify available resources in each catego ry, and pres ents guidan ce for m aintain ing accu rate resource lists. CATEGORIES OF RESOURCES Resources can be categorized usefully in two ways: by source --organiz ation or sec tor wh ere the resource can be obtained; and by type--based on the nature or purpose of the resource. Maintaining lists of resources by source and by type, or using a database that allows you to sort the inform ation by these categories, is extrem ely valuable in an inciden t. We'll disc uss resour ce lists in m ore detail la ter. For now, let' s take a closer look at each of these categories. SOURCE OR LOCATION OF R ESOURCES Many organizations, both in governm ent and the private sector, have resources available to response agenci es. Som e of these organizations, including addresses and phone num bers, ar e listed at the end of this unit. Government Resources The governm ent provides num erous types of resources. T here are three basic levels of governm ent: 1. Local. 2. State. 3. Federal. SM 9-3 RESOURCES Local Government As discussed previously, local govern ment is the first line of defense agains t all hazards, the level at w hich the ap plication of all em ergency efforts occur. Local governm ent is responsible for developing an organized, com prehensive em ergency m anage ment system capable of efficient and effective treatm ent of potential and actual em ergencies. Local governm ent is the first line of planning and training as well. Various agencies m ay be involved, including em ergency m anage ment, fire, police, e mergency m edical se rvices, water departm ent, general counsel, and building and zoning. Each has an im portant role to play in hazardous m aterials plan ning and response. An important governm ent resource for em ergency response agencies is the Local Em ergency Planning Committee, or LEPC (discuss ed in Unit 2: Regulations and Standards). This organization is re quired by law to maintain preplans and resource lists. First responders should know how t o access this infor mation in an em ergency. State Government State governm ent is a source of legisl ated authorities and extraordinary powers affecting d isasters. S tates al so possess adm inistrative sk ills an d other resources to supplem ent and facilita te loca l efforts. In their role as a condu it between local and Fede ral levels of governm ent, States interpret and enforce national laws and program s. They provide planning, funding, and operational suppor t to local governm ent. Various agencies--in ental ment, National Guard, transportation/highw ay departm ent, and the S tate Emergency Response Comm ission (SERC)--will be involved . Keep in m ind that each State and co mmunity m ay have different resou rces available or m ay call sim ilar resources by different nam es. For exam ple, the State of New York has the Depart ment of Environm ental Conservation (DEC). The State of New Jersey ha s the Departm ent of Environm ental Protection (DEP). Basically, the tw o agencies perform similar functions. Federal Government The Federal governm ent provides legal authorities, fiscal resources, research, technical inform ation and se rvices, and specia lized personnel. Emergency program s of various Federa l agencies are coo rdinated th rough the Federal Em ergency Managem ent Agency (F EMA). SM 9-4 RESOURCES Federal agencies with a role in ha zardous m aterials planning and response include the Environm ental Protecti on Agency (EPA), Departm ent of Transportation (DOT), National Response Team (NRT), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG), M eteorological Services, and the Departm ent of Defense (DOD). For exam ple, under 40 Code of Fede ral Regulations (CFR) 310 (found in Appendix D), local governm ents can request financial restitution for certain cos ts from EPA. Private Sector Resources The private sector p rovides an extrem ely large and diverse bas e of specialized personnel, tec hnical assistance, equipm ent, and other m aterial, which can b e called upo n in an em ergency. Examples of valuable private sector sources, which vary from community to community, include contractors--waste haulers, clea nup com panies, technical experts, consultants; manufacturers--chem ent, other national associations; public utilities--telephone, electr ic, water, bro adcast and cable television, radio, natural gas; common carriers--tru cking com panies, railroads , airlines, shipping firms, pipelines; and local institutions- -universitie s, colleges, hospitals, and other health -care facilities, res earch centers. CHEMTRE C Of particular im portance to hazardo us materials e mergency responders is the ical Transp ortation E mergency Center, or CHEMTREC. CHEMTREC, a service of the Chem ical Manufacturers Association (CMA), operates around the clock to receiv e toll-free calls from the United States and Canada, which can be dialed directly at 1-800-424- 9300. (For guidebook users in the Washington, DC calling area, chang e all guide references from the 1-800 number to 703-527-3887.) Em ergency collect calls are accepted by the center at 0-703-527-3887. For em ergencies involving chem icals, CHEMTREC provides imm ediate advice for the onscene commander. CHEMTREC can usually provide hazard inform ation, warnings, and g uidance when given the identificatio n number or name of the product and the nature of the problem . If the product is unknown, give the CHEMTREC communicator as m uch inform ation about the incident as you know. CHEMTREC then will contact the s hipper for more detailed assis tance. SM 9-5 ation Transm ission (HIT) program , can fax a hard copy of chem ical-sp ecific inform ation. This information m ay include any of more than 400,000 Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS' s) currently on f ile at CHEMTREC. This service is available only for ch emical em ergency situ ations. F or add itional inform ation on the enhanced H IT program, call the CHEMTREC nonem ergency num ber, 1-703-741-5525. Types of Resources Resources also can b e categorized b y type. One or m ore types m ay be available through the various organiza tional sources discussed above. In gene ral, the f ocus o f this d iscussion is on local resou rces av ailable through the private sector , although State and F ederal capabilities m ay be brought to bear in a larger incident. For our purposes, five basic types of resources have been identified 1. People. 2. Services. 3. Equipm ent/Supplies. 4. Publications. 5. Com puter resources. People and Services People and services vary by location. People who can assist at a haz mat incident range from em ergency re sponders (fire, police, Em ergency Medical Services (EMS)) to personnel from local businesses and industry. The next-door neighbor who has a Ph.D. in chem istry or a heavy equipm ent operator from a local c onstruction fir m can be im portant resources in a hazardou s materials em ergency. Finding people and services can be as easy as opening the phone book and being resourceful. Som e specialized service resources are spill or cleanup contractors, catering s ervices, technical or analytical as sistan ce, an d hazardous w aste hau lers. SM 9-6 RESOURCES Equipment and Supplies Equipment and supplies som etimes overlap services. For example, cleanup crews m ay bring their ow n equipm ent and supplies, such as trucks, absorbent m aterials, etc. This saves the responder from making multiple pho ne calls. Exam ples of equipm ent resou rces are bulldozers, trucks, generators, handtools, and personal protective e quipm ent (PPE). Useful supplies include cat litter, speed y dry, other absorbent m aterials, and firefighting foam. Depe nding on the situation, th e list can be alm ost endless. Publications Hazardous m aterials in clude thousands of chem icals, each with com plex characteristics and related response re quirem ents. No one, not even the experts, can know everything. For th is reason, reference m anuals are particularly im portant in haz m at operations. Many different publications are av ailab le. So me useful ones are lis ted below, although others m ay be equally or m ore ap propriate in specific situations; you should investigate pub lications available or recomm ended in your community. More detail on the following reference m aterials is included at the end of the unit. DOT 's North American Emergency Response Guidebook (DOTNAER G); National Fire Protection Association' s (NFPA) Fire Protection Guide on Hazardous Materials; National In stitute for Occupation al Safety and Health /Occupational Safety and Health Administra tion's (NIOSH/OSHA) Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards; The Condensed Chemical Dictionary; DOT 's CHRIS Hazardous Chemical Data ; Dangerous Properties of Industrial Materials, by Sax; Emergency Handling of Hazar dous Materials in Surface Transportation from the Bureau of Expl osives of the Association of Am erican Railroads; and Patty's Industrial Hygiene and Toxicology . SM 9-7 RESOURCES Computer Resources Com puter resources can be useful in emergency planni ng and response by helping to sim ulate complex chem ical reactions (e.g., plum e dispersal, chem ical id entification, spill contr ol, etc. ). They also ca n be used f or storage and rapid retrie val of great volum es of data (e.g., resource inventory lists, MSDS form s). Som e programs have been developed by private sector com panies and m ay be e xpensive. Others are available from Federal and State governm ents at little or no cost. Important com puter resources th at you should know about as first responders are CAMEO; CHRIS or OHM/TADS; MICROME DIX (TOMES); and (CAMEO)--a Macintosh- and PC-com patible system providing highly detailed air modeling and chem ical searching a nd prof iling capabilities. CAMEO addresses the requirem ents of the Superfund Amendm ents and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA) Title III for m anaging community right-to-know surveys and the e mergency response and planning inform ation on chem ical handling facilities. Chemical Hazards R esponse In formation System (CHRIS)--a PC- compatible program that displays a nd/or prints e mergency response data on several thousand chem icals. CHRIS often is used in tandem with the Oil and H azardous Materials Technical Assistance Database System (OHM/TADS). MICROME DIX (TOMES) is a computer database or an online service dedicated to providing chem ical a nd drug effects and interactions for hazardous Hazardous Materials Infor mation Exch system is a nationwide electronic bu lletin board sponsored by FEMA and DOT. The HMIX was designed for the distribu tion and exchange of hazardous materials inform ation by first responde rs, private industry, State and local planners, contractors, and others interested in haz mat issu es a nd program s. SM 9-8 RESOURCES IDENTIFYI NG RESOURCES As part of preincident planning, co mmunities decide ho w to catego rize resources an d then create a lis t of what is av ailable locally. The two m ain categories of government and privat e sector resources subdivided by resource type (people, services, eq uipm ent/supplies, publications, others) is a good place to start. As a first responder, you should do the sam e. Prep are a list of resource names and phone num bers before an in cident occurs! Also, identify the basic resources that you should carry w ith you at all tim es. Then \"never leave hom e without them.\" During the incident, be careful to se lect the ap propria te re source f or the situation and use the resources effectively Remember, resources are all around you, lim ited only by your imagination. The term s \"re source s\" and \"resourceful\" go hand in hand. Being reso urceful m eans the ability to act effectively in a difficult situation. A difficult situation m ay be just what you, as a first responder, encounter in a hazardou s materials in cident . It is im portant to stay as calm as possible and use your avai lable resources effectively. One exam ple of an ineffective u se of a resource is using 100 gallons of water to wash down a spill area when absorbing the product with 50 pounds of c at litter would do the job more effic iently. Although it would be faster to wash down th e spill, that action would create an environm ental cleanup 10 tim es the size. Always think about the consequences. The regular m aintenance of your resour ce list is critical. The infor mation should be updated reg ularly, inco rporating additions, d eletions, and /or changes. By keeping accurate inform ation and using the lists effectiv ely, you can ensure access to the assist ance you need during an incident.

Established in 1971, it is a public serv ice of the Chem ical Ma nufacturers Association (form erly Manufacturing Che mists Association) in W ashington, D.C. CHEMTREC operates in two stag es: First, on receip t of infor mation regard ing th e nam e of a chem ical, it provides imm ediate advice on the nature of the product and steps to be taken in handling the early stages of a problem . Second, CHEMTREC prom ptly contacts the shipper of the material inv olved f or more deta iled information and appropria te follow- up, including on-scene assi stance when feasible. While the C enter's prim ary m ission is to help in transpo rtation inciden ts, it also provid es support a nd hazardous m aterials em ergencies in non-transportation situations. CHEMTREC operates 24 hours a day, seve n days a week to receive calls on phone num bers shown above. The num ber is widely circulated in professional literature dist ributed to em ergency serv ice per sonnel, ca rriers, the chem ical industry, bulletins of govern ment agencies, trade associations and others who m ay have need. It is not circulated in the public press. The public need is best served through the em ergency services. CHEMTREC is not a reporting center. The Departm ent of Transportation handles this function. CHEMTREC s hould be called only in those cases where assistance is n eeded. CHEMTREC, in its years of operati on, unfortu nately h as received m any calls that were not pertinent to em ergencies.
