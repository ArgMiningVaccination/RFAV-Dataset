This formula is a combination of homeopathic ingredients formulated by our holistic veterinarian, Dr. Jean Hofve. There are many potential causes for a pet's skin irritations or itching, but the most common one is flea bite allergy. If your pet is allergic to flea saliva, then a single bite can produce severe itchiness that may last for weeks. Mange mites, particularly scabies, can also be incredibly itchy. Effective parasite control is the top consideration. There are very few pets that don't itch now and then, and the occasional scratching here and there is not unusual. But when it becomes frequent, and/or you see visible skin irritations, hot spots, or fur loss, your pet may have a health condition that needs addressing. Constant scratching is annoying for you, and can be quite miserable for your pet, so finding a solution is important. Prolonged licking and scratching damages the skin's barrier function and only make the problem worse. Available in a 1 oz liquid. Country of origin: USA Manufacturer: Only DOSAGE INSTRUCTIONS - Typical dosage amount is 5 to 10 drops administered orally 3 times daily. - Homeopathic remedies are best given at least 20 minutes before or after a meal. - Drop the liquid directly into the animal's mouth or on the gums. - If this is difficult to do with your pet, you may also administer it by mixing it with drinking water, milk, a treat, or food. For acute injuries, trauma, and illnesses, the remedy can be given every 15 minutes for the first hour, reducing to every 30 minutes for the next hour, then to once in the third hour. This may be all that is needed to stimulate the healing process and resolve the imbalance. For chronic conditions, administration 3 times daily is the general recommendation. As the symptoms resolve, you may reduce the frequency of the dosage. Other allergies may also cause skin symptoms, particularly inhalant allergies. In humans, inhaled allergy particles, such as pollen or mold, usually result in \"hay fever\" symptoms like sneezing and a runny nose. However, we almost never see that reaction in pets; they usually respond with itchy skin, hot spots, flaky skin, scabs, and even red itchy ears. Even food allergies can cause skin symptoms. True food allergies are uncommon in pets, though cats seem to be affected more often than dogs. Many ear infections are probably the result of underlying allergies. Other common causes of itchiness in pets include ringworm (which is actually a fungus), endocrine (hormone) disorders, drug reactions, and autoimmune disease. Nerve irritation from a collar may be a trigger; you may want to consider using a harness instead. Infections of irritated skin by bacteria and yeast are common; but usually these are secondary, and the primary cause must still be determined and treated. Because some of these conditions can be serious, it is important to try and determine the cause and deal with that issue directly if possible. A healthy skin and coat depend on a healthy diet; many times simplifying the diet or changing foods will make a big difference. An essential fatty acid supplement (like fish oil) can also be very helpful. Bathing your pet more frequently (to remove allergens, parasites, bacteria, yeast, and skin secretions) may also be needed. Whatever the cause, this homeopathic formula can be a good way to help relieve the irritation and itchiness, while you address the underlying cause. About Homeopathy Homeopathy is a natural, holistic system for healing that works by eliminating the underlying imbalance in a pet?s body that is causing unwanted symptoms. In homeopathy, health is defined as not just the absence of symptoms, but a feeling of well-being and vitality. Homeopathy has been used for more than 200 years. It follows Aristotle?s theory that 'like cures like.' For example, ipecac in large doses will cause nausea, salivation, and violent vomiting in a healthy person. In contrast, homeopathic ipecac can cure those same symptoms in a sick patient. In addition, homeopathy uses the principle of the ?minimum dose.? Homeopathic remedies are made from natural substances such as plants and minerals that are highly diluted (potentized) and shaken (succussed), which eliminates any toxic effects of the natural substance. It is literally impossible to overdose with a homeopathic formula, and they are generally safe for use with other remedies or medicines. "}
