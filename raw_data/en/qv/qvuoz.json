The proposed minor modification would allow the following changes to the Approved Site Plan (collectively, the \"Proposed Modifications\"): (i) expansion of the boundaries of the LSCFD to incorporate three out parc els, comprising approximately 7,513.5 square feet (\"sf\") of lot area, on Parcels E and M on Block 5631 (Lots 9, 71 and 73) that were not previously included on the Approved Site Plan; (ii) development of a new 7- story building (the \"New Building\") containing Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care facilities and/or hospital related facilities, accessory off -street parking and related accessory uses on a zoning lot consisting of Lots 1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 74, 75, 76, 77 and 78 on Block 5631 (the \"Development Site\" or \"Parcel E\") on the western edge of the LSCFD fronting 9th Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets; (iii) removal from the Approved Site Plan of a previously approved (but unbuilt) 10- story building containing Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care facilities, hospital related facilities, accessory off -street parking and related accessory uses (the \"Previously Approved Building\") that was proposed to be developed on Lots 65, 69 and part of Lot 38 on Block 5631 (the \"PAB Site\") and elimination of height and setback and rear yard waivers for the Previously Approved Building; and (iv) change in the approved uses of the PAB Site to allow the existing attended accessory off -street parking and Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnost ic and treatment health care uses to remain. Purpose and Need of the Proposed Action The Development Site and the PAB Site are part of the LSCFD that was established in 1967 by the Commission pursuant to then ZR Sections 78- 31 and 78 -41 (curr ent ZR Sections 79- 21 and 79-31). New developments or enlargements of existing buildings, not shown on the Approved Site Plan require Commission approval, even if the new or enlarged buildings would otherwise be permitted as -of-right. Since 1967, the Com mission has approved seven applications for additional authorizations, special permits and modifications to the LSCFD boundaries, two applications for minor modifications and five applications for the grant, renewal and modification of revocable consents f or pedestrian and service tunnels and bridges across 10th Avenue and 48th Street (collectively, the \"Prior Approvals\"). The Proposed Modifications would not require any new authorizations or special permits to be granted or any relief granted Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 2 Sustainable Management LLC under the Pr ior Approvals to be increased. The New Building has been designed to comply with all applicable zoning requirements, including requirements governing floor area, lot coverage, height and setback, and off -street accessory loading and parking. Removal of t he Previously Approved Building from the Approved Site Plan would eliminate the need for the height and setback and rear yard relief for the Previously Approved Building (the \"PAB Waivers\") originally granted by the Commission in 1989 pursuant to an author ization under ZR Section 79- 21 (N880525 ZAK). As discussed below, the proposed modifications could result in a net incremental increase in the With -Action scenario of 16,817 sf of additional diagnostic and treatment health care facilities over the No- Action\\ scenario. The buildings on the Development Site are currently occupied by various administrative and support departments of MMC, including Patient Representatives, Academic Affairs, Security, Planning, Design and Construction, Psychiatry Residency as well as a variety of out -patient treatment facilities and physician offices including Vascular Surgery, Pediatric Urology and Plastic Surgery. During construction of the New Building, these uses will be relocated to other existing facilities within the LS CFD. The MMC's existing treatment and diagnostic facilities, administrative offices and accessory parking facilities operate at or beyond capacity. The New Building will provide much needed space for state- of-the-art facilities serving a variety of med ical, surgical and pediatric sub - specialties, including the practices noted above as well as other existing practices currently located in other buildings in the LSCFD. Because the New Building has been designed specifically to house Use Group 4 ambulator y diagnostic and treatment health care uses, as compared to the existing buildings on the Development Site, which were designed for residential uses, it will allow for significantly greater efficiency in operations, staffing and patient services. The proposed 263- space off -street parking facility will help alleviate demand for parking in the existing parking garage on Parcel B. Larger, more efficient floor plates with modern electrical, plumbing, HVAC and communications systems will be able to house diagnostic and other equipment that cannot be accommodated in the existing buildings. Likewise, the New Building would provide a superior alternative to the Previously Approved Building that was previously proposed and approved. The New Building allows for s ignificantly larger floor plates than the Previously Approved Building (approximately 19,700 gsf versus 10,550 to 14,140 gsf). The larger floor plates allow the New Building to be only 7 stories instead of 10 stories for the previously approved building , which reduces height as well as construction and operating costs and increases efficiency and flexibility for programming of uses. The corner location of the New Building is also superior to the mid -block location of the Previously Approved Building. It provides excellent light and air on 3 sides of the building and allows for traffic circulation to be significantly dispersed. For the PAB Site, all vehicle trips (inbound, outbound and drop- offs) would travel along 49th Street. For the New Building, drop- offs can be made along 9th Avenue, while in- bound and out -bound trips would be split between 48th and 49th Streets. T he Previously Approved Building would partially fulfill the programmatic and parking needs of the MMC, which would be fully addressed by the New Building. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 3 Sustainable Management LLC Background The LSCFD spreads over five blocks that are generally bounded by 47th Street to the north, Fort Hamilton Parkway to the east, 49th Street to the south and 9th Avenue to the west. The following table identifies the parcels comprising the LSCFD site by tax block and lot (the LSCFD Site), including the project site for the proposed Medical Office Building (Parcel E). Lots marked with an asterisk would be incorporated into the LSCFD as part of the proposed modifications. The site plan (Drawing Z -1) in Attachment 5 depicts the location of the parcels. Parcel Block Lots A 5625 27, 44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52 B 5626 1 E (Project Site) 5631 1, 6, 9*, 10, 11, 12, 13, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 F 5631 38, 55, 65, 69, 70 G 5632 1, 19, 27 H 5638 19 L 5631 14 M 5631 71*, 72, 73* The LSFCD Site has an aggregate lot area of 298,206 sf and is located entirely within an R6 residential district, which would permit a maximum of 1,431,388.7 sf (4.8 FAR) of community facility uses in the aggre gate. A C1 -3 commercial overlay is mapped along the west side of Fort Hamilton Parkway, to a depth of 100 feet, covering a portion of Parcel G. The project site (Parcel E) consists of multiple tax lots that will be merged into a single zoning lot with an aggregate lot area of 29,152.4 sf. The Project Site, which lies within the R6 district, generates a maximum base community facility floor area of up to 139,931.4 sf. The project site is currently improved with 12 2- story semi- detached buildings, origi nally constructed for residential uses but now used for ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care facilities and related uses, containing an aggregate of approximately 45,966 gross square feet (gsf) of floor area. Project Description The proposed modifications would allow for the demolition of existing improvements on the project site and replacement with a new 7 -story plus mechanical penthouse medical office building (the New Building ) containing approximately 201,563 gsf of floor area for Use Gro up 4A ambulatory diagnostic or treatment health care facilities and related accessory uses, which is approximately 1,940 zsf less than the maximum 139,931.4 z sf of community facility floor area permitted on the site. The height of the proposed building, including the penthouse, would be 116 feet above ground level and would have two below ground parking levels with off -street accessory parking. The Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 4 Sustainable Management LLC parking facility will provide up to approximately 263 attended parking spaces. Vehicles would enter the park ing facility from 48th Street via a 16 -foot curb cut. Vehicles would exit the facility via a 19.4 foot curb cut on 49th Street. One off -street loading berth will be accessible from 49th Street. Under ZR Section 25- 18, the maximum number of parking spaces permitted for community facility uses in R6 zoning districts is 1 space per 400 sf of lot area, or 73 spaces for the Project Site. The number of spaces may be increased under ZR Section 25- 19 by demonstrating to the DOB that the additional spaces are needed for visitor s and employees of the proposed development and that the parking facility is designed to minimize traffic on residential streets. DOB has indicated that the 263 space facility proposed f or the New Building meets these conditions and that it wi ll approve the request for the additional spaces when an application is made to the DOB for a new building permit for the New Building. The previously approved site plan for the LSCFD included a proposed 10- story building containing approximately 104,421 sf of Use Group 4A ambulatory diagnostic or treatment health care facilities and related accessory uses (the Previously Approved Building ) to be developed on the north side of 49 th Street to the east of the Project Site, on a portion of Parcel F (Block 5631, Lots 65, 69, 70 and part of Lot 38 (PAB Site )). The site currently contains an accessory off - street parking lot, containing spaces for approximately 46 vehicles, and three 2 -story buildings containing approximately 7,965 sf of medical and administrative offices. Under the proposed modifications, the New Building would be constructed on the Project Site in lieu of the Previously Approved Building and the existing uses on the PA B Site would remain. Although the Project Site allows for a more efficient floor plate, lower building height and better parking layout in the New Building than the PAB Site permits for the Previously Approved Building, it is reasonable to assume that Maimonides would move forward with construction of the Previously Approved Bui lding in the absence of the Proposed Modifications, given its need to consolidate and upgrade existing uses that are currently scattered throughout the LSCFD Site. Under the previously approved site plan, the LSCFD was permitted to contain an aggregate of 1,009,655 sf of floor area, including the floor area allocated for the Previously Approved Building. Under the proposed modifications, the LSCFD would be permitted to contain an aggregate of 1,025,842 sf of floor area, a net increase of only 16,187 sf. Accordingly, the proposed modifications would be expected to generate only a de minimis number of additional employees visitors and vehicle trips under the future build condition as compared to the future no-build condition. Analysis Framework Accordin g to the CEQR Chapter 2 -320 \"Discretionary actions sometimes permit a range of project characteristics, or development scenarios to occur, even though the action may be sought in order to facilitate a specific development. From the range of possible scena rios that are considered reasonable and likely, the scenario with the worst environmental consequences is chosen for analysis. This is considered to be the RWCDS, the use of which ensures that, Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 5 Sustainable Management LLC regardless of which scenario actually occurs, its impacts woul d be no worse than those considered in the environmental review.\" In accordance with the CEQR Chapter 2 -320, the following analyses will be made for the project site area by comparing a Reasonable Worst Case Development Scenario ( RWCDS ) of the future without the project in place (No- Action scenario ) with a RWCDS with the project in operation (With -Action scenario ). Potential impacts will be determined based on the incremental differences between the two scenarios. The existing condition, No- Action, With -Action scenarios and the incremen tal differences between the No -Action and With- Action Scenarios are presented below . Existing Condition Development Site The development site consists of twelve (12) 2- story existing buildings and outdoor uses, comprising a pproximately 45,966 gross square feet ( gsf) of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and off -street acc essory parking (35 spaces) in the aggregate . PAB Site The existing buildings and outdoor use s on Lots 65 and 69 consists of a n aggregate of 7,956 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and 46 off -street accessory parking spaces on part of Lot 38. RWCDS No -Action Scenario Development Site On the Development Site, the existing buildings and outdoor uses, comprising approximately 45,966 gsf (30,644 sf of floor area (\" zsf\")) of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and off -street accessory parking in the aggregate, would remain. PAB Site On the PAB Site, t he Applicant would construct the Previously Approved Building within the same footprint and maximum permitted building envelope for the Previously Approved Building depicted on the Approved Site Plan. In doing so, the Applicant would rely on the PAB Waivers, which wai ve the requirement under ZR Section 24-382 to provide a 60- foot deep rear yard equivalent on the PAB Site and which allow the 6 th through 10th Stories and mechanical penthouse of the Previously Approved Building to penetrate the sky exposure plane beginning a t a height of 60 feet above curb level set by ZR Section 24-522. The Previously Approved Building would contain approxi mately 139,312 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and 150 attended off -street accessory parking spaces, which would be consistent with the Approved Site Plan. Since the Previously Approved Building would comply with the Approved Site Plan and PAB Waivers, the Applicant could construct the Previously Approved Building without the need for any discretionary approval by the Commission or other City agency. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 6 Sustainable Management LLC Accordingly, under the No- Action Scenario, the Development Site and the PAB Site would contain 185,278 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and 185 off -street accessor y spaces. RWCDS With -Action Scenario Development Site The twelve (12) existing buildings would be demolished and replaced with the New Building, containing approxi mately 201,563 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses, including 263 off -street accessory parking spaces in the cellars . PAB Site The existing buildings and outdoor uses on Lots 65 and 69 would remain, as would the existing accessory off -street parking lot on part of Lot 38, comprising an aggregate of 7,956 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and 46 off -street accessory parking spaces. Accordingly, under the With- Action Scenario, the Development Site and the PAB Site would contain 209,519 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnosti c and treatment health care uses and 309 off- street accessory parking spaces . Increment al Difference between the No -Action and With- Action Scenarios The incremental differences between the RWCDS No-Action and RWCDS With -Action Scenarios ional 24,241 gsf and 124 off- street accessory parking spaces . The incremental difference of square footage is below the CEQ R threshold for trip generation screen . Shadows A. INTRODUCTION The RWCDS No -Action s cenario (the twelve 2 -story buildings at the development site and the 10-story building at the PAB site) would not result in a significant shadow impact (see Attachment 9) . The RWCDS With -Action building would reach approximately 116 feet in height. The shadow study examines whether the RWCDS W ith-Action building would cast shadows on any publicly accessible sunlight -sensitive resources. Sunlight -sensitive resources can include parks, playgrounds, gardens, and other publicly accessible open spaces; sunlight dependent architectural features of hi storic resources; and important natural features such as water bodies. As described under \"Project Description\", this analysis has been prepared using the RWCDS With -Action Scenario. The analysis provides a conceptual analysis of the potential impacts of t he proposed the RWCDS With- Action Scenario. The detailed analysis concluded that the proposed project would not result in any shadows on sunlight -sensitive resources, at any time of year. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 7 Sustainable Management LLC B. DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGY Incremental shadow is the additiona l, or new, shadow that a structure resulting from a proposed action would cast on a sunlight -sensitive resource. Sunlight -sensitive resources are those resources that depend on sunlight or for which direct sunlight is necessary to maintain the resource's usability or architectural integrity. Such resources generally include: Public open space (e.g., parks, beaches, playgrounds, plazas, schoolyards, greenways, landscaped medians with seating). Planted areas within unused portions of roadbeds that are part o f the Greenstreets program are also considered sunlight -sensitive resources. Features of architectural resources that depend on sunlight for their enjoyment by the public. Only the sunlight -sensitive features need be considered, as opposed to the entire resource. Such sunlight -sensitive features might include: design elements that depend on the contrast between light and dark (e.g., recessed balconies, arcades, deep window reveals); elaborate, highly carved ornamentation; stained glass windows; historic landscapes and scenic landmarks; and features for which the effect of direct sunlight is described as playing a significant role in the structure's importance as a historic landmark. Natural resources where the introduction of shadows could alter the resource 's condition or microclimate. Such resources could include surface water bodies, wetlands, or designated resources such as coastal fish and wildlife habitats. Non-sunlight -sensitive resources include, for the purposes of CEQR: City streets and sidewalks ( except Greenstreets); Private open space (e.g., front and back yards, stoops, vacant lots, and any private, non- publicly accessible open space); Project -generated open space cannot experience a significant adverse shadow impact from the project, according to CEQR, because without the project the open space would not exist. However, a qualitative discussion of shadows on the project -generated open space should be included in the analysis. A significant adverse shadow impact occurs when the incremental shad ow added by a proposed project falls on a sunlight -sensitive resource and substantially reduces or completely eliminates direct sunlight, thereby significantly altering the public's use of the resource or threatening the viability of vegetation or other re sources. Each case must be considered on its own merits based on the extent and duration of new shadow and an analysis of the resource's sensitivity to reduced sunlight. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 8 Sustainable Management LLC METHODOLOGY First, a preliminary screening assessment must be conducted to ascert ain whether a project's shadow could reach any sunlight -sensitive resources at any time of year. The preliminary screening assessment consists of three tiers of analysis. The first tier determines a simple radius around the proposed building representing t he longest shadow that could be cast. If there are sunlight -sensitive resources within this radius, the analysis proceeds to the second tier, which reduces the area that could be affected by project shadow by accounting for the fact that shadows can never be cast between a certain range of angles south of the project site due to the path of the sun through the sky at the latitude of New York City. In New York City, this area lies between - 108 and +108 degrees from true north. If the second tier of analysis does not eliminate the possibility of new shadows on sunlight -sensitive resources, a third tier of screening analysis further refines the area that could be reached by project shadow by looking at specific representative days of the year and determining t he maximum extent of shadow over the course of each representative day. If the third tier of analysis does not eliminate the possibility of new shadows on sunlight sensitive resources, a detailed shadow analysis is required to determine the extent and dur ation of the incremental shadow resulting from the project. The detailed analysis provides the data needed to assess the shadow impacts. The effects of the new shadows on the sunlight -sensitive resources are described, and their degree of significance is considered. The results of the analysis and assessment are documented with graphics, a table of incremental shadow durations, and narrative text. C. PRELIMINARY SCREENING ASSESSMENT A base map was developed (see Figure 1 ) showing the location of the proposed project and the surrounding street layout. In coordination with the land use and historic resources sections of this EAS, potentially sunlight -sensitive resources were identified and shown on the map. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 9 Sustainable Management LLC Figure 1 Project Site and Play ground TIER 1 SCREENING ASSESSMENT For the Tier 1 assessment, the longest shadow that the proposed structure could cast is calculated, and, using this length as the radius, a perimeter is drawn around the project site. Anything outside this perimeter representing the longest possible shadow could never be affected by project generated shadow, while anything inside the perimeter needs additional assessment. According to the CEQR Technical Manual , the longest shadow that a structure can cast at the latitude of New York City occurs on December 21, the winter solstice, at the start of the analysis day at 8:51 AM, and is equal to 4.3 times the height of the structure. Ther efore, at a maximum height of 116 feet above curb level, the proposed buildi ng co uld cast a shadow up to 498.9 feet in length (116 x 4.3). Using this length as the radius, a perimeter was drawn around the project site (see Figure 2 ). Since a playground lies within the perimeter or longest shadow study area, the next tier of screening assessment was conducted. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 10 Sustainable Management LLC Figure 2 Tier I Screening TIER 2 SCREENING ASSESSMENT Because of the path that the sun travels across the sky in the northern hemisphere, no shadow can be cast in a triangular area south of any given project site. In N ew York City this area lies between -108 and +108 degrees from true north. Figure 3 illustrates this triangular area south of the project site. The complementing area to the north within the longest shadow study area represents the remaining area that coul d potentially experience new project generated shadow. A number of sun- sensitive resources are located in the remaining shadow study area, and therefore the next tier of screening assessment was performed. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 11 Sustainable Management LLC Figure 3 Area That Cannot Be Shaded By T he Proposed Action TIER 3 SCREENING ASSESSMENT The third tier of assessment uses three -dimensional computer modeling software to more accurately refine the area that could be reached by project shadow by looking at specific representative days of the year and determining the maximum extent of shadow over the course of each representative day. The direction and length of shadows vary throughout the course of the day and also differ depending on the season. In order to determine whether project gen erated shadow could fall on a sunlight -sensitive resource, three- dimensional computer mapping software is used in the Tier 3 assessment to calculate and display the proposed action's shadows on individual representative days of the year. A three -dimensiona l representation of the proposed building was developed based on plans and elevations provided by the applicant. REPRESENTATIVE DAYS FOR ANALYSIS Shadows on the summer solstice (June 21), winter solstice (December 21) and spring and fall equinoxes (March 21 and September 21), which are approximately the same in terms of shadow Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 12 Sustainable Management LLC patterns) are modeled, to represent the range of shadows over the course of the year. An additional representative day during the growing season is also modeled, generally the day halfway between the summer solstice and the equinoxes, i.e. May 6 or August 6, which have approximately the same shadow patterns TIMEFRAME WINDOW OF ANALYSIS The shadow assessment considers shadows occurring between one and a half hours after sunrise and one and a half hours before sunset. At times earlier or later than this timeframe window of analysis, the sun is down near the horizon and the sun's rays reach the Earth at very tangential angles, diminishing the amount of solar energy and producing shadows that are very long, move fast, and generally blend with shadows from existing structures until the sun reaches the horizon and sets. Consequently, shadows occurring outside the timeframe window of analysis are not considered significant under CEQR , and their assessment is not required. TIER 3 SCREENING ASSESSMENT RESULTS Figure 2 illustrates the range of shadows that would occur, in the absence of intervening buildings, from the proposed building on the four representative days for analysis. For informational purposes the boundaries of the analysis area are shown on Figure 2 . As they move east and clockwise over the landscape, the shadows are shown occurring from the start of the analysis day (one and a half hours after sunrise) to the end of the analysis day (one and a half hours before sunset) . On the March 21/September 21 and December 21 analysis days, the RWCDS With -Action's shadow would be long enough to reach the playground if there was no 5-story school building blocking the angle of the shadow . The shadow st udy is presented in Attachment 9 . Project -generated shadow s would not reach the playground on the May 6 and June 21 analysis day s. The Tier 3 screening assessment concluded that shadows from the RWCDS With -action building would reach the playgro und on the March 21/September 21 and December 21 analysis days. Therefore, a detailed analysis was conducted for those analysis days. D. DETAILED SHADOW ANALYSIS For the detailed analysis, the computer model used in the Tier 3 assessment was further developed with three -dimensional representations of the RWCDS With -Action building and the John J Pershing School IS 220 building in the study area to determine the shadows that would result with the proposed action. Shadow analyses were performed for each of the representative days and analysis periods indicated in the Tier 3 assessment. Shadows are in constant movement. The computer simulation software produces an animation showing the movement of shadows over the course of each analysis period. The analysi s is with the animation of the RWCDS With - Action condition to determine the time when the shadow would enter a sun- sensitive resource, and the time it would exit. March 21/September 21 : The shadow from the proposed 7- story building c ould reach the playgr ound from 6:30 AM to 9:30 AM. However, the existing 5-story school building located between the proposed building and t he playground would block all of the shadow s from the proposed 7- story building . Therefore, the shadow would not be cast on the playground. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 13 Sustainable Management LLC December 21: The shadow from the proposed 7- story building could reach the playground from 8:51 AM to 9:21 AM. However, the existing 5 -story school building located between the proposed building and the playground would block all of the shadows from t he proposed 7- story building. Therefore, the shadow would not be cast on the playground (see Attachment 9 ). CONCLUSIONS The proposed building would not cast any shadows on the playground. Therefore, given all these factors, the playground would not be s ignificantly impacted by project -generated shadow s. There would be no significant incremental difference between the RWCDS No -Action and RWCDS With -Action Scenarios. Urban Design and Visual Resources METHODOLOGY Based on the CEQR Technical Manual , a preliminary assessment of urban design and visual resources is appropriate when there is the potential for a pedestrian to observe, from the street level, a physical alteration beyond that allowed by existing zoning. Examples include projects that permit th e modification of yard, height, and setback requirements, and projects that result in an increase in built floor area beyond what would be allowed \"as -of-right\" or in the future without the proposed project. The Proposed Development (RWCDS With- Action) would result in physical alterations to the proposed development site observable by pedestrians. According to the CEQR Technical Manual , the study area for urban design is the area where the project may influence land use patterns and the built environment, and is generally consistent with that used for land use analysis. For visual resources, the view corridors within the study area from which such resources are publicly viewable should be identified. A view corridor is defined as a connection from the publi c realm to significant natural or built features, including views of the waterfront, public parks, landmark structures or districts, otherwise distinct buildings or groups of buildings, or other natural features. The land use study area may serve as the initial basis for analysis; however, in cases where significant visual resources exist, it may be appropriate to look beyond the land use study area, to encompass views outside the area, as is the case with waterfront sites or sites within or near historic d istricts. Views to the Proposed Development site are limited to the immediately surrounding streets. Therefore the study area focuses on a 400 -foot area study area, consistent with the land use study area. The CEQR Technical Manual recommends an analysis of pedestrian wind conditions for projects that would result in the construction of large buildings at locations that experience high wind conditions (such as along the waterfront, or other locations where winds from the waterfront are not attenuated by buildings or other natural features), which may result in an exacerbation of wind conditions due to\" channelization\" or \"downwash\" effects that may affect pedestrian Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 14 Sustainable Management LLC safety. As the Proposed Development would not result in a large building in a location that experiences high wind conditions, a pedestrian wind conditions analysis is not required. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT Existing Conditions PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT SITE The subject site for the proposed development consists of twelve (12) 2- story red brick residen tial buildings and outdoor uses, comprising approximately 45,966 gross square feet (gsf) of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care uses and off -street accessory parking (35 spaces) in the aggregate. The proposed project site is genera lly bounded by the 48 th Street to the north, 10th Avenue to the east, 49th Avenue to the south and fronts on 9th Avenue to the west. The study area is defined as being within a 400- foot radius of the project site and is presented in the following figure. The proposed development site and 400 foot study area are located in a typical mixed- use residential and community facility neighborhood in the Borough Park neighborhood in Brooklyn, with a mix of building types, styles, and uses. Within the 400- foot radi us study area the predominant building types include, between 48 th and 49th streets and 9th and 10th avenues: a 6- story public school located on the west side of 9th Avenue across from the proposed project development site and some 2 -story brick residentia l buildings behind it. On the East side of 9th Avenue there are various buildings in the Maimonides Medical Center LSCD plan area, including the 6- story building at 920 East 48th Street(adjacent to the proposed development site), and adjacent to the East o f that the 4/5 -story Elson Research Center on 48th Street, two 2 -story red brick residential buildings, a parking lot enclosed with a metal fence on 49th street that was the site scheduled for the previously approved building (PAB) site, and a portion of a n existing 6 -story MMC building located immediately to the East. Opposite the subject block on the south side of 49th street is 950 East 49th Street, a 10 -story apartment building. The other structures on the south side of 49th street are predominately 2 -story red brick residential structures. The remaining buildings within the study area are 2 -, 3- and 4- story red brick residential buildings, some of which are in institutional use. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 15 Sustainable Management LLC Figure 4 Existing Condition Study Area No visual corridors are affected in the study area. As described below, the community facility expansion resulting from the proposed action would be consistent with the predominant uses in the study area, and not result in significant adverse impacts related to Urban Desi gn and Visual Resources. FUTURE NO -ACTION SCENARIO Under the future No -Action Scenario, the proposed development site would remain in use with twelve 2 -story red brick residential style buildings in use by the medical center for ambulatory care and of fices (see photos below). The previously approved project (PAB) site which is currently a parking lot on 49 th Street located to the east of the proposed development site, and backing on the 4/5- story Elson Research Center on 48th Street would be developed with the previously approved 10 -story building (158 feet high). PAB STUDY AREA Within the 400- foot study area for the PAB site the urban landscape would include the 4/5- story Elson Research building, a 6- story MMC building at 920 East 48th Street adjacen t to the proposed development site, a 6- story MMC building adjacent to the PAB site to the East and a 4- story apartment building on 10th Avenue. On the opposite side of 10th Avenue to the East are MMC institutional buildings ranging from 7 - to 10- stories, a 5-story parking garage at 48/47 streets, a 4 -story apartment building and a 4- story Yeshiva school located at 10th Avenue and 47th Street. There is a 5 -story bridge over 10th Ave. between 48th and 49th streets connecting MMC buildings on either side of t he avenue (see photo). The remainder of the PAB study area has 2 -Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 16 Sustainable Management LLC story, mostly red brick, residential buildings and two 2- story commercial buildings on 10th avenue (see photos below). There would be no effect on natural features that are enjoyed by the community or are designated as special resources in the Zoning Resolution. No significant effect on public open space, landmarks or landmark districts, or distinct buildings or groups of buildings would result from the action. The proposal would not have a significant effect on wind pressure or down- washed wind pressure or on sunlight. The pedestrian experience at street level would be similar to that on nearby streets as to street wall, building heights, regularity of street grid, site planning and configu ration, parking and streetscape.

FUTURE WITH -ACTION SCENARIO The twelve (12) existing buildings on the development site would be demolished and replaced with the proposed 7- story b uilding (116 feet high) , containing approxi mately 201,563 gsf of Use Group 4 ambulatory diagnos tic and treatment health care uses, including 263 off -street accessory parking spaces in the cellars . Maimonides Medical Center (MMC) is seeking a minor modification to the previously approved site plan within the existing large -scale community facility de velopment (LSCFD) for the MMC. The Proposed Building has been designed to comply with all applicable zoning requirements, including requirements governing floor area, lot coverage, height and setback, and off -street accessory loading and parking. The proposed project would increase the community facility floor area by approximately 24,241 gsf (the incremental difference between the RWCDS No-Action and With- Action scenarios). The proposed 7- story building (116 feet high) would have 3- stories less than the 10- story (158 feet high) previously approved building (PAB) that would have been located on 48 th Street. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 26 Sustainable Management LLC NORTHFigure 10 RWCDS With -Action Scenario 0 100' 200' 200' Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 27 Sustainable Management LLC The proposed development of a 7- story medical building fronting on 9th Avenue between 48th and 49th streets would be contextual or similar to other buildings in the study area, particularly the institutional 6 -story medical building at 920 East 48th Street immediately adjacent to the subject site, the 4/5 -story institutional Elson Research building adjacent to that on 48th Street, the 10-story apartment building at 950 East 49th Street and the institutional character of the public school located on the opposite side of 9th Avenue to the West of the subject site. The street wall will be generally consistent with the street walls on 48th and 49th Streets and on 9th Avenue. The building fa\u00e7ade will be brick masonry and gray limestone with clear glazed windows and will have a first story base of gray quartz.

No v isual corridors would be affected within the study area . There would be no effect on natural features that are enjoyed by the community or are designated as special resources in the Zoning Resolution. No signifi cant effect on public open space, landmarks or landmark districts, or distinct buildings or groups of buildings would result from the action. The proposal would not have a significant effect on wind pressure or down- washed wind pressure or on sunlight. The pedestrian experience at street level would be similar to that on nearby streets as to street wall, building heights, regularity of street grid; site planning and configuration, parking and streetscape (see photos below). The proposed project would ther efore not result in a significant impact related to Urban Design and Visual Resources and no further analysis is warranted. An aerial photograph of the project site is presented below.

Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 33 Sustainable Management LLC Looking at the site from 49th Street The No -Action and the With- Action Scenario development are present ed below: No -Action Scenario on 9th Avenue With -Action Scenario on 9th Avenue Neither the proposed project nor the PAB would result in significant changes to the urban landscape of the area. Buildings in a R6 zoning district allow a maxim um allowable FAR of 4.8 for a typical height of 6- stories for community facility uses. The total allowable zoning floor area permitted on the proposed development site would amount to 139,931.42 zsf (29,152.38 zsf x 4.8 allowable FAR). The operational, le gal and construction related limitations on the projected Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 34 Sustainable Management LLC development site would constrain the proposed development to approximately 137,991.98 zsf or 201,563 gsf . Therefore the proposed building is in compliance with the zoning regulations. The increment al differences between the previously approved RWCDS No- Action and the RWCDS With -Action scenarios would not be significant. Further, the proposed building, which would be contextual with various institutional buildings in the surrounding area, would not negatively impact the built environment since it is similar to predominate building types in the area. The proposed building would not be significantly taller than the 6- story public school located opposite on 9 th Avenue or the building immediately adjacent to the proposed building on 48th Street. Further, the previously approved (RWCDS No- Action) 10- storiy building would be 3- stories taller than the proposed building (RWCDS With - Action). The proposed building is also in keeping with other medical center buildings within the adjacent medical center LSCFD. The proposed action would not de -map an active street or map a new street. The action would result in no significant effect on street hierarchy. The action would not have a significant effect on view corr idors or visual resources because the proposed building would not block any existing view corridors or visual resources as (see the above photo views). There would be no effect on natural features that are enjoyed by the community or are designated as special resources in the Zoning Resolution. No significant effect on public open space, landmarks or landmark districts, or distinct buildings or groups of buildings would result from the action. The proposal would not have a significant effect on wind pressur e or down- washed wind pressure or on sunlight. The pedestrian experience at street level would be similar to that on nearby streets as to street wall, building heights, regularity of street grid, site planning and configuration, parking and streetscape. The proposed action would therefore not result in a significant impact related to Urban Design and Visual Resources and no further analysis is warranted. Hazardous Materials Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) reports dated July 23, 2012 we re prepared by Sustainable Management LLC in accordance with current ASTM standards for the subject property. The Phase I ESA found multiple 275- gallon aboveground oil tanks for boilers and an unidentified container. The Phase I ESA reports were submitted to the NYC DEP for review. Based on the New York City Department of Environmental Protect (NYC DEP) comments on the Phase I ESA reports, a Phase II Subsurface Investigation was conducted for soil, groundwater and soil vapors. The Phase II Subsurface Inve stigation report had following conclusions: The soil analysis results indicated that all soil sample results including Volatile Organics (VOCs ), Semi -Volatile Organics ( SVOCs ), Pesticides, PCBs and Metals are below the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation ( NYSDEC ) Part 375- 6.8(b) Restricted Residential Soil Cleanup Objectives (SCOs). The SVOCs, Pesticides and PCBs are all below the NYSDEC P art 375- 6.8(a) Unrestricted Use SCOs . All results except Dioxane are the NYSDEC P art 375- 6.8(a) Unrestricted Use SCOs. All Metal results except for Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 35 Sustainable Management LLC Chromium/Hexavalent and Lead are below the NYSDEC P art 375- 6.8(a) Unrestricted Use SCOs. The analysis results indicated that the groundwater sample results did not detect VOCs, SVOCs, Pesticides or PCBs. All filtered sample results of Metals are below the DEC water quality standards except for Antimony and Sodium. All unfiltered sample results of Metals are below the DEC water quality standards except for Antimony , Iron and Sodium . The soil NYC DEP comments on the Phase II Subsurface Investigation report, a Remedial Work Plan (RAP) and Construction Heal th and Safety Plan (CHASP) were prepared and submitted to the NYC DEP for review and subsequently approved. Soils will be excavated to a depth of approximately 28 feet at the proposed building footprint. The excavated contaminated soil will be mechanical ly screened to remove debris. Screened soil will be stockpiled within a bermed area covered by heavy layers of polyethylene sheeting. Soil samples will be collected from the stockpiles for laboratory analysis to determine characterization for disposal if the disposal facility requires additional analysis. It is anticipated that the soil will be analyzed for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semi volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), TAL metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure (TCLP), RCRA characteristics, and other methods as required by the disposal facility. The stockpiles will be covered by layers of polyethylene sheeting that will be secured to the area outside the berm to prevent exposure of the soil to the elements and collection of runoff. Any runoff liquid generated during the remedial activities will be containerized, analyzed and properly disposed of. If use of in -place and stockpiled soil is planned, permission will be obtained from NYC DOHMH in ac cordance with NYCRR 360- 1.15. All known or found USTs and ASTs (including dispensers, piping, and fill -ports) will be properly removed/closed in accordance with all applicable NYSDEC regulations. If the NYSDEC requests any additional investigative/remedia l measures, then all pertinent documentation will be forwarded to DEP for our files. If any petroleum impacted soil (such display petroleum odors and/or staining) are encountered during the excavation/grading activities, the impacted soils will be removed and properly disposed of in accordance with all federal, state and local regulations. If de -watering into NYC storm/sewer drains will occur during the proposed construction project, a NYCDEP Sewer Discharge Permit will be obtained prior to the start of a ny de -watering activities at the site. For the proposed project, groundwater sampling for NYCDEP Sewer Discharge Criteria will be completed in any areas where de- watering is expected. The NYSDEC will be notified of groundwater contamination. Any further re quirements from the NYSDEC will be met. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 36 Sustainable Management LLC Air monitoring will be conducted in accordance with the approved CHASP using dust monitors and a PID, and will take place in accordance with the New York State Department of Health guidance values. Monitoring for background levels will take place at the start of each work day. The monitors will then be moved to the downwind side of any ongoing work to monitor for excessive levels of dust or flammable gasses. Dust suppression will be maintained by the contractor d uring the excavating and grading activities at the site. The PID will be used to monitor for any potentially explosive vapors. Upon receipt of the analytical data for soil characterization that satisfies the disposal facility requirements and facility ac ceptance, the soil will be loaded for transport to the disposal site. The actual volume of stockpiled soil may vary based upon actual field conditions encountered. In the event that certain contaminated soils are saturated and free draining, the use of r oll-off containers with built -in sumps will be used to collect the liquid and will be utilized to transport the contaminated soils for treatment or disposal to an appropriately permitted facility. The disposal facility has not yet been determined as more than one type of facility may be required. Based on the known nature of the soil contamination, disposal facilities and options are readily available. Any liquids (liquid drained from soils) generated in the course of the remediation may involve transport to an appropriate disposal facility. The final decision on a disposal facility has not been reached at this point in time. The final disposition of contaminated materials will be in accordance with all applicable federal state and local statutes and r egulations. Disposal facilities will be selected based on the results of laboratory analysis for disposal parameters, distances to facility and cost of disposal. The New York City Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) will be notified in writing ( five days prior to the removal of any contaminated materials) with the names of the waste transporters and disposal facilities and their respective licenses and permits for review. The excavation equipment will be visually brushed clean upon completing ex cavation of the contaminated area and handling of contaminated soils. This will be done to minimize the generation of wash water at the site that would need off -site disposal The areas of the site that will be excavated for construction will be remedied. Upon completion of the contaminated soil excavation activities, all areas to be landscaped or unpaved areas will be covered by a two -foot thick cover of clean fill soil that is underlain by an indicator such as an orange plastic snow fence to delineate th e cover soil from the subsurface soil. The two feet of clean fill/top soil will be imported from an approved facility/source and graded across all landscaped/grass covered areas of the site not capped with concrete or asphalt. The clean fill/top soil will be segregated at the source facility, have qualified environmental personnel collect representative samples at a frequency of one (1) sample for every 250 cubic yards, analyze the samples for Target Compound List (TCL) VOCs, SVOCs, Pesticides/PCBs and TA L Metals by a NYCDOH -certified laboratory, compare to the NYSDEC Part 375- 6.8(a) Unrestricted Used Soil Cleanup Objectives, and receive DEP written approval to use the clean fill/top soil. Upon receipt of DEP's written approval, the clean fill/top soil will be transported to the site for grading. Dust suppression activities will be implemented if conditions indicate that dust may Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 37 Sustainable Management LLC become problematic during the grading activities at the site. The clean fill/top soil will not be comprised of any constr uction and demolition (C&D) debris. The source facility for the clean soil has not yet been determined but it is readily available. Non -vegetated area (buildings, roadways, parking lots, etc.) will be covered by a paving system or concrete at least six i nches thick. Should the remedy result in residual contaminated soil staying in place, a site management plan may be required. A site management plan addresses future disturbance or contact with contaminants remaining in soil following the remedial actio n. The plan would require soil characterization and, where applicable, disposal/reuse in accordance with applicable regulations. Evaluation of the potential for vapor intrusion for any buildings developed on the site may be required, including the provis ion for mitigation of any impacts identified. The site management plan can also identify any use restrictions, and provide for the operation and maintenance of the components of the remedy. Imposition of an institutional control in the form of an environmental easement could be also required as part of the site management plan. An appropriate vapor barrier system will be incorporated into the design plan for all structures during the proposed construction project. The conceptual design of the vapor b arrier system to include manufacture specification and a sample will be submitted to the DEP for review and approval. Upon completion of all DEP requested remedial requirements, a P.E. certified Remedial Closure Report will be submitted to the DEP. This report will demonstrate that all remedial activities have been implemented appropriately. At a minimum, the report will include all transportation manifests, soil disposal/recycling certificates, proof of importing and grading certified clean fill/top soil for all landscaped areas, all preapproved soil analytical testing results for the imported fill/top soil, proof of depressurization and vapor barrier system installation (including photographs) and any other supporting documentation necessary. A copy of the CHASP (construction health and safety plan) is included in the appendices. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.120, each individual involved in field activities potentially exposing them to hazardous substances and/or situations have received 40 -hours of OSHA HA ZWOPER training as well as medical surveillance. The Health and Safety Manager and Site Health and Safety Officer shall be responsible for overall implementation and coordination of the Health and Safety Program for field personnel at the site. The Healt h and Safety Manager is Chunyuan Li (646- 380-1939) of Sustainable Management LLC. The Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO) is Chunyuan Li (646- 380-1939) of Sustainable Management LLC. If the Site Health and Safety Officer must leave the project site, he may designate another qualified employee as an alternate Site Health and Safety Officer. The anticipated duration of the work period will be established prior to daily activities. The work will only be performed during daylight hours. Ambient temperature and weather conditions should also be considered. When ambient temperatures rise or fall to a level which may hinder personnel performance or becomes a threat to personal safety, consideration should be given to stop work and recommence work when temperatures or conditions are less severe. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 38 Sustainable Management LLC There will be no hazardous materials E -designation placed on the subject site since DEP will handle site closure and sign- off. The DEP correspondence letters and incident log form are presented in Attachment 10. With implementation of the RAP and CHASP the proposed action would not result in significant hazardous material impacts. No incremental difference between the RWCDS No -Action and RWCDS With- Action scenarios would occur since either scenario would require a RAP and CHASP. Transportation TRAFFIC The proposed modifications to the LSCFD would allow for the demolition of existing improvements on the project site and replacement with a new 7- story plus mechanical penthouse medical office building containing approximately 201,563 gsf of floor area for Use Group 4A ambulatory diagnostic or treatment health care facilities and related accessory uses. The proposed building would have two below ground parking levels with off -street accessory parking. The proposed parking garage will provide up to approximately 263 attended parking spaces. Vehicles would enter the parking facility from 48th Street via a 16 -foot curb cut. Vehicles would exit the facility via a 19.4 foot curb cut on 49th Street. As shown in the section of Analysis Framework, the incremental difference between the RWCDS No -Action and With- Action scenarios would be 124 off -street accessory parking spaces. The following analysis is based on the incremental difference of 124 off -street accessory parking sp aces. Maimonides Medical Center (MMC) has an existing accessory parking garage with a licensed capacity of 538 spaces which is located at 4723 10 th Avenue (between 47th and 48th Streets). The proposed accessory parking garage would have a total of 263 spaces. The proposed garage would be used for accessory parking for the MMC and is similar to the existing medical center garage. The garage survey at the existing garage with a capacity of 538 parking spaces was conducted from 7AM to 7 PM. The survey data is presented in attachment and is summarized in Table 1. The in and out vehicle trips for the proposed garage are calculated based on the survey at the existing garage with a capacity ratio of 0.4888 (263/538). The calculated in/out vehicle trips for the proposed garage are presented in Table 1.

Survey taken on January 20 and 25, 20111/20/2011 Survey 1/25/2011 Survey Proposed Garage (263 Spaces) Standardized at Existing Garage Survey Average Incremental (124 Spaces) The incremental 124 parking spaces would result in 51 vehicular trips (34 in and 17 out) for the AM peak hour (7- 8 AM), 6 vehicul ar trips (2 in and 4 out) for midday peak hour (1- 2 PM) and 34 vehicular trips (19 in and 15 out) of the PM peak hour (6- 7 PM). It should be noted that proposed garage is only one block away from the existing garage. The existing garage utilization exceed s the licensed capacity as shown in the survey (see Table 1). Some vehicles using the existing garage are already in the study area and will go to the proposed garage. Therefore, the actual project generated vehicle trips should be lower than those in Tab le 1. As shown in Table 1 the project generated vehicle trips would be below the CEQR threshold of 50 trips for the midday and PM peak hours. Trip assignments for the AM peak hour at adjacent intersections of 9 th Avenue at 48th and 49th Streets are pres ented in Figure 18. As shown in Figure 1 the vehicle trips at the adjacent intersection of 9th Avenue and 48th Street would be 40 for the AM peak hour. The vehicle trips at the adjacent intersection of 9th Avenue and 49th Street would be 34 for the AM peak hour. The project generated vehicle trips would be below the CEQR threshold of 50 at any intersections for the AM peak hour. Therefore, no further traffic study is required. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 40 Sustainable Management LLC Figure 1 8 Project Generated Trip Assignment -AM Peak Hour 49th Street9th AvenueSITE9 8Project Generated Traffic Volumes - AM Peak Hour 3 20 13 5 6 10 7173 3448th Street MASS TRANSIT The incremental difference of 124 parking spaces would not generate any mass transit users. The number of project generated bus riders from the incremental floor area of 24,241 gsf would be below the CEQR threshold of 200 trips. The number of project generated subway riders would be below the CEQR threshold of 200 trips. Therefore, no significant mass transit impacts are anticipated. PEDESTRIAN The incremental difference of 124 parking spaces would not generate any pedestrians since there are elevators and stairwells in the garage. The project generated pedestrians from the incremental difference of 24,241 gsf would be below the CEQR threshold of 200 trips. Therefore, no significant pedestrian impacts are anticipated. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 41 Sustainable Management LLC Air Quality STATIONARY SOURCE The RWCDS With -Action scenario would be a new 7-story medical office building with the gross floor area of 201,563 square feet. The proposed building would use natural gas fired boilers for heating. However, both natural gas and fue l oil #2 are assumed to be used in order to conduct a conservative analysis. A screening analysis was performed in accordance with 3Q - 322.1 of the CEQR Technical Manual to determine the potential for significant stationary source air quality impacts from the HVAC systems. The height of the boiler emission stack on the proposed buildi ng would be at a height of 119 feet (the penthouse building of 116 feet + stack height of 3 feet). The closest adjacent building with similar or greater height is located at 9 26 49 th Street (see attachment 7 ). The closest distance from the proposed building to the adjacent building (926 49th Street) is approximately 120 feet. Based on intervening distance the NO 2 (natural gas) and SO 2 (fuel oil #2) emissions would be below the threshold value (Attachment 7) . The proposed building would not result in significant air quality impacts. The project site is located within R6 zoning district. The surrounding area within 400- foot radius from the project site is also in R6 zoning distri ct. There are no manufacturing uses or processing facilities within the 400- foot radius area. GARAGE EMISSIONS The With -Action scenario would have a two- level parking garage located on two cellars below . The proposed garage would have 263 parking spaces , 116 spaces in the cellar and 147 spaces in the sub- cellar. The total floor area of the garage is 47,738 square feet. Garage air quality analysis was conducted for the RWCDS With -Action scenario in accordance with the CEQR Technical Manual. The garage a ir quality analysis results (see Attachment 7 ) indicate that the proposed garage would not result in significant air quality impacts . Therefore, in accordance with the CEQR Technical Manual, the proposed project would not result in significant air quality impacts. Noise The project site is located on the east side of 9 th Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets. 9th Avenue is a two -way roadway with traffic volumes of more than 500 for the weekday AM, midday and PM peak hours. 48th Street is a one way eastb ound roadway with traffic volumes of more than 200 for the weekday AM, midday and PM peak hours . 49th Street is a one way westbound roadway with traffic volumes of more than 200 for the weekday AM, midday and PM peak hours . The proposed action would add 124 off -street accessory parking spaces. The project generated vehicle trips would not result in doubling of the exi sting traffic volumes on any streets . According to the CEQR Technical Manual, n oise from the project generated and/or rerouted vehicular t raffic is not expected to result in significant adverse noise impacts . Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 42 Sustainable Management LLC Construction Impacts Construction of the new building will take 18- 24 months to complete. During excavation and construction there may be periods when trucks entering or ex iting the site might temporarily impede traffic. Such periods would be of short duration. It is not anticipated that there will be any long term narrowing of street access. The proposed action will follow the RAP and CHASP. Hours of Work Construction ac tivities would be carried out in accordance with New York City laws and regulations, which allow construction activities between 7 Am and 6 PM on weekdays. Construction work would typically begin at 7AM on weekdays, with most workers arriving between 6 AM and 7 AM. Normally weekday work would end between 3:30 and 4 PM, but it can be expected that in order to meet the construction schedule or to complete certain critical tasks, the workday may occasionally be extended beyond normal work hours. Any extended work hours would generally end at 6PM and would not include all construction workers on- site, but only those involved in the specific task requiring additional work time. Night and weekend work would not be scheduled regularly, but may occur occasionally t o make up for bad weather delays, unforeseen circumstances, or special activities such as erecting/dismantling cranes. In such cases, appropriate work permits from DOB and DOT, would be obtained and advance notice to local residents would be made. Similar to an extended work day, the number of workers and pieces of equipment in operation would be limited to those needed to complete the particular task at hand. If required, the typical weekend workday would be on Saturday from approximately 9 AM to 5 PM. Deliveries and Access During construction, access to the construction site would be controlled. The work areas would be fenced off, and limited access points for workers and trucks would be provided. Security guards and flaggers would be posted as necessary . After work hours, the gates would be closed and locked. Security guards may patrol the construction site after work hours and on weekends to prevent unauthorized persons access. Material deliveries to the site would be controlled and scheduled. It is ant icipated that the majority of the truck deliveries would enter and leave the site via 48 th and 49th streets. In a letter dated February 21, 2014 (see appendices) from Anthony M Tigre, Principal of Americo n Construction Inc. to Robert Dobruskin, DCP Direc tor of Environmental Review, the following is stated: \"The placement of the construction entrance to the site will be placed at the farthest feasible point on the opposite side of 9 th Avenue away from the school. The proposed construction will mostly tak e place on the frontage of 48th and 49th street. Therefore most construction deliveries Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 43 Sustainable Management LLC and materials will be a good distance away from the school entrance on the opposite side of 9th Avenue.\" \"With respect to pedestrian flow, at least one side of every s treet affected by the proposed work will be fully accessible to pedestrians and bicycles. Only the proposed building site will have sidewalk and lane closure at any time during construction.\" \"No sidewalk or lane closures will take place adjacent to the s chool. It is not anticipated that any construction vehicles will drive on 48 th or 49th streets adjacent to the school.\" Closures and Staging Similar to other construction projects within New York City, temporary curb -lane and sidewalk closures would be r equired adjacent to the proposed development site. Flag persons may be present at active driveways, where needed, to manage the access and movement of trucks, and to ensure the safety of pedestrians. The staging and laydown of materials would be done eithe r within the subject site or along the perimeter of the site within delineated areas. Maintenance and Protection of Traffic (MPT) plans would be developed for any temporary curb- lane or sidewalk closures. Approval of these plans and implementation of the c losures would be coordinated with NYCDOT. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF PROJECT CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES Construction can be disruptive to surrounding areas for periods of time. Because the proposed medical building would be near a school the following analyse s describe potential construction impacts associated with the proposed medical building development with respect to transportation, air quality, and noise. Number of Construction workers and material deliveries. Excavation Phase During the excavation phase of the project an estimated 21 workers will be on site. An estimated 60 trucks per day (120 trips) between 8AM and 4PM (approx.7.5 trucks per hour) will be involved in the excavation process. Construction Phase During construction an estimated 7 0 workers per day will be on site during the peak construction period. Various trades may come and go at different times during the day. Transportation The construction transportation analysis is based on a study of peak worker and truck trips taking into account several factors, including: worker modal splits, vehicle occupancy and trip distribution; and truck passenger car equivalents (PCEs) and arrival patterns. Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn Page 44 Sustainable Management LLC Based on the latest available U.S. Census data (2000 Census) for workers in the construction and excavation industry it is anticipated that 51 percent of construction workers would commute by private auto at an average occupancy of 1.3 persons per vehicle. Therefore the number of vehicles (36) will not exceed the CEQR threshold of 50 trips during the peak hour for the requirement of a traffic study. The combination of construction traffic and construction w orker vehicles would be not more than 44 (numbers rounded up) trips. The distance from the school to the frontage of the proposed medical bui lding is approximately 70 feet. No construction traffic will occur on the side of 9 th Avenue adjacent to the school and no construction traffic will occur on 48th or 49th street on the side of 9th Avenue adjacent to the school, therefore there will be no significant impact on traffic in the immediate vicinity of the school. Noise . All construction equipment will comply with existing noise standards for such equipment. Since the number pf PCE's will not exceed the requirement for a traffic study according to the CEQR Technical Manual there will be no significant impact from traffic generated noise . Air Quality Because the of the low number of PCE's the mobile source air quality threshold for construction vehicles will not be exceeded, Therefore, the proposed action would not result in significant Construction Impacts.

PARKING GARAGE AIR QUALITY ANALYSIS 1. Intro duction The proposed action is a minor modification of the existing Large Scale Community Facility Development Plan specia l permit for the Maimonides Medical Center to include a proposed 7-story plus mechanical bulkhead medical office building . The proposed building would have ambulatory diagnostic and treatment health care facilities, offices and reception areas plus a 263-space underground accessory parking garage . The Build year of the proposed pr oject is 2016 . The proposed building would have a gross floor area of 201,567 square feet (SF). The project site is located on the east side of 9th Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets. The proposed parking garage would be located on two cellar level s of the proposed building. This air quality analysis was conducted to determine if there would be impacts from the garage emissions . The total proposed garage parking area is 47,738 SF. The parking area of the cellar is 23,505 SF with 116 parking space s. The parking area of the sub -cellar is 24, 233 SF with 147 parking spaces . The site plan and the proposed garage space layout are presented in Appendix A. The e ntrance of the proposed garage is located on 48th Street and the exit of the proposed garage i s located on 49th Street. The garage ventilation vent location is not determined yet. In order to conduct a conservative analysis it was assumed that there would be only one ventilation vent although a second vent could be added on the design. The first floor is 16 feet in height. It is also assumed that the single ventilation vent would be located near the first floor ceiling and it is approximately 12 feet above the sidewalks on either 48th Street or 49th Street . The garage emissions are related to ve hicle activity within the garage . The higher vehicle volumes result in the more carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from the garage. The proposed accessory parking garage would have a total of 263 spaces. The proposed garage would be used for accessory parking for the medical center and would be similar to the existing medical center garage which is located at 4723 10 th Avenue (between 47th and 48th Streets) . The garage survey at the existing garage with a capacity of 538 parking spaces was conducted from 7AM to 7 PM. The survey data is presented in Appendix B and summarized in Table 1. The in Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 2 Sustainable Management LLC . and out vehicle trips for the proposed garage are calculated based on the survey at the existing hospital garage . The calculated vehicle in/out trips for the proposed garge are presented in Table 1. The highest 8 -hour vehicle trips would occur during the period of 11 AM to 7 PM with a total of 317 vehicular trips ( 91 ins and 226 outs) . The averag e peak hour vehicle trips are 11 ins and 28 outs. In order to conduct a c onservative analysis, the highest entering vehicles of 72 during the 7- 8 AM and highest exiting vehicles of 57 during 5- 6 PM were used in the analysis although they would never happens in the reality.

Incremental difference between RWCDS No-Action and With-Action scenarios would be 124 parking spaces. 4. The proposed garage in/out is based on the ratio of garage capacity (263/538 = 0.4888).5. Survey conducted on January 20 and 25, 20111/20/2011 Survey 1/25/2011 Survey Project Gemerated Proposed Garage (263 Spaces) Standardized at Existing Garage Survey Average The garage air quality analysis is based on inbound and outbound vehicle trips during the 8- hour periods in accor dance with the CEQR guideline . The peak hour truck trips generated from the proposed project would be below the threshold of 12 truck trips per hour. Therefore, a PM2.5 impact analysis is not required. It should be noted that the project generated trucks would not use the proposed garage. 2. Methodology The air quality impacts of the proposed parking garage were evaluated by calculating the auto emissions under the Build C ondition (year of 2016 ) within the garage. T he vehicle trips which would go into and out of the garage were Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 3 Sustainable Management LLC . analyzed . The MOVES 2010b computer model (an EPA approved model) was used to compute emissions. In order to conduct a conservative analysis, it is assumed that a ll departing autos are in a cold start state and all arriving autos are in hot start. All departing autos are projected to idle for one minute before traveling to the exit of the parking garage, and all arriving and departing autos are assumed to travel at 5 miles per hour within the parking garage. The carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations resulting from these emissions were then determined using the methodology described in the CEQR T echnical Manual -Air Quality/ GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AIR QUALITY IMPACTS FROM PARKING GARAGES (see Table 3 ). Basic data for MOVES inputs is presented in Table 2. Table 2 MOVES Input Data Location County Kings County, New York Calendar Year 2016 Month January Time 5:00 PM to 5:59:59 PM (hour 18) Weekday/Weekend Weekday Temperature 43 \u00b0F Humidity 57.3% Road type of links Link 1: Off -network Link 2 (inbound): Urban unrestricted access Link 3 (outbound): Urban unrestricted access Roadway link len gth Link 2 (inbound): 611 feet (0.116 miles) Link 3 (outbound): 611 feet (0.116 miles) Off-Network Idling Time Link 1: Idling for 1 minute Link Traffic Volume Inbound (Link 2) 72 vehicles per hour Link Traffic Volume Outbound (Link 3) 57 vehicles per ho ur Link Average Speed Inbound (Link 2) 5 miles per hour Link Average Speed Outbound (Link 3) 5 miles per hour Average Road Grade Inbound (Link 2) -0.07 Average Road Grade Outbound (Link 3) 0.07 A mean winter temperature of 43 \u00b0F and a persistence fac tor of 0. 7 (8-hour) were used in accordance with the CEQR Technical Manual. The mean travel distance used in the emission calculation was 611 feet (including 180-foot ramps ) which are calculated as following: Mean Travel Distance Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 4 Sustainable Management LLC . = 2/3 x (garage le ngth + Garage width) + Average Ramp Length = 2/3 x (200' + 145') + (180' x 116 +540' x 147)/(116 +147) = 611 feet where 180' is the ramp le ngth for the cellar, 540' is approximately three times the ramp length for the sub-cellar since a vehicle has to make approximately three times the ramp length to get to the sub- cellar , 116 parking spaces are planned for the cellar and 147 parking spaces are planned for the sub -cellar. The emission dispersion was performed in accordance with the CEQR Technical Manual A ppendices -Air Quality/GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATING AIR QUALITY IMPACTS FROM PARKING GARAGES . CO concentration at a receptor was calculated using the closed garage methodology. It should be noted that the MOVES outputs are in grams per hour. The dispersion in put as shown in Table 4 is in grams per second. The MOVES output divided by 3,600 seconds /hour result s in grams per second (g/s) . 3. Background CO Levels The background CO levels are from the NYC Department of City Planning. The CO concentration of 3.1 parts per million ( ppm) was used f or the background concentration. The mobile line source CO concentration for 48th or 49th Streets was calculated based on the MOVES2010b results for 348 vehicles and the CEQR Technical Manual. The MOVES2010b output for 348 vehicles is 1,484 grams/mile -hour which is equal to 0.0002561 g/m -s. The CEQR method for maximum mobile source emission results in: 307.7 x (8-hour persistence factor) x MOVES (g/m 307.7 x 0.7 x 0.0002561 = 0.055 ppm 4. Receptor Locations The adjacent s idewalk s are approximately 15 feet in wi dth on 48th and 49th Street s. Both 48th and 49th Street s are approximately 30 feet in width. The first floor is 16 feet in height. Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 5 Sustainable Management LLC. Three (3) receptors were selected to represent the wo rst case scenario and are described below: 1 Rec eptor 1 is located on the south side walk of 48th Street , approximately 7 feet from the garage vent and assuming at the 6 feet below the garage vent. 2 Receptor 2 is located on the no rth sidewalk of 48th S treet, approximately 52 feet from the garage vent and assuming at the 6 feet b elow the garage vent. Receptor 3 is located on the window on the second floor and is assumed to be just above the garage vent (0 feet from the garage vent). The receptor locations are presented in Appendix A. The CO concentrations due to the parking garage emissions were superimposed onto the background concentrations to determine total concentrations on the receptors. 5. Comparison to and Confor mance with Air Quality Standards The one -hour and eight -hour CO standards of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS ) are 35 ppm and 9 ppm, respectively. CO levels from the parking garage emissions were superim posed on the background concentrations to determine the total concentrations for each receptor. The total concentrations were compared to the NAAQS. In addition to the NAAQS, the City of New York applies a de minimis impact criterion to determine the significance of the incremental incre ase in CO concentrations that would result from the proposed project. These set the minimum change in eight-hour average carbon monoxide concentrations that constitutes a significant environmental impact. According to these criteria, significant impacts are defined as follows: An increase of 0.5 parts per million (ppm) or more in the maximum eight -hour average carbon monoxide concentration at a location where the predicted no action eight- hour concentration is equal to 8 ppm or between 8 ppm and 9 ppm; or An increase of more than half the difference between baseline (i.e., no-action) concentrations and the 8 -hour standard, when no -action concentrations are below 8 ppm. The CO levels due to the project were co mpare d to the de m inimis criterion. 3 Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 6 Sustainable Management LLC. 6. Analysis R esults The M OVES2010b outputs for mobile line source emissions are presented in Appendix C. The emission factors from MOVES2010b and dispersion analysis results for the proposed garage are presented in Table 4 . The total 8-hour concentrations consist of the combination of the background concentration, mobile line source emission concentration and the garage emission concentrations . The analysis results are summarized in Table 3 . Table 3 Total Concentration Receptor location Background ppm Mobile Line Source, ppm Analysis Result, ppm Total Conc. ppm 1 3.1 0.0 0.58 3.7 2 3.1 0.06 0.44 3.6 The highest total 8 -hour concentratio n would be 3.9 ppm (3.1 ppm b ackgroun d level + 0.80 ppm garage emissio n concentration) at Receptor 3 (the receptor at the 2nd floor window). Th e predicted eight-h our CO level of 3.9 ppm is below the NAAQS standard of 9 ppm. The potential impact of the project on CO levels was evaluated at the three receptor locations. The re sults of the air quality analyses indicate that the proposed garage would not result in a significant impact on CO levels in the Study Area with an air ventilation flow rate of 2 cubic feet per minute per square foot of garage area. In addition to the NAAQS, the City of New York applies a de minimis impact criterion to estimate impacts on air quality. The analysis results show that the de minimis criterion would not be exceeded. 7. Conc lusions The propo sed accessory garage with 263 spaces would not result in significant air quality impacts. 3 3.1 N/A 0.80 3.9 Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, New York Page 7 Sustainable Management LLC .

Page 1 Sustainable Management LLC Construction Health and Safety Plan Maimonides Medical Center 4802 10th Avenue Brooklyn , New York 1.0 Purpose The purpose of this Construction Health and Safety Plan ( CHASP ) is to establish a protocol for protection of Sustainable Management LLC employees and other on- site and off -site personnel from incidents that may arise while performing field activities related to soil excavation for the redevelopment of the Maimonides Medical Center site located in Brooklyn , New York. This CHASP has been prepared in accordance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) document \"Emergency and Remedial Response Division's Standard Operating Safety Guides\", November 1984. This plan establishes personnel protection standards, mandatory operations procedures, a nd provides contingencies for situations that may arise while field activities are being conducted at the site. All field personnel will be required to abide by the procedures set forth in this CHASP . Adherence to this CHASP will minimize the possibility that personnel at the site or in the surrounding community will be injured or exposed to site - related contaminants during field activities. Subcontractor personne l will be provided with a copy of this CHASP for their consideration. A copy of this CHASP will be maintained at the site for the duration of the field activities. Personnel performing the field activities involving chemical substances may encounter conditions that are unsafe or potentially unsafe. In addition to the potential risks associat ed with the physical, chemical, biological and toxicological properties of the material(s) which may be encountered, other types of hazards (i.e. electricity, water, temperature, heavy equipment, falling objects, loss of balance, tripping, etc.) can have a n adverse effect on the health and safety of field personnel. It is important that personnel protective equipment (PPE) and safety requirements be appropriate to protect against potential and/or known hazards. PPE will be selected based on the type(s), c oncentration(s), and routes of personnel exposure from identified hazardous substances at the site. In situations where the type of materials and possibilities of contact are unknown or the potential hazards are not clearly identifiable, a more subjective and conservative determination will be made of the PPE required for initial safety. 2.0 Site Conditions The subject site is located at 901 -913 49th Street and 902 -916 48th Street, Brooklyn, Kings County, New York. The subject site is referred to as Block 5631, Lots 1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 74, 75, 76, 77 and 78 by the City of New York Tax Assessor's Office. The land area is 29,152 square feet. The subject site is located o n the east side of 9 th Avenue between 48th and 49th Streets in the Borough Park section of Brooklyn, New York. Currently the subject site consists of twelve (12) 2- story medical office buildings . The environmental conditions of the site known to date ha ve been presented in the following reports: Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 2 Sustainable Management LLC Phase I Environmental Site Assessment Report ( Sustainable Management LLC, July 23, 2012); and Phase II Subsurface Investigation R eport ( Sustainable Management LLC, August 30, 2013). Based on the soil and groundwater sampling results as shown in the Phase II Subsurface Investigation Report ( August 30, 2013), the site related contaminants of concern and the maximum concentrations detected are listed as follows: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in parts per million (ppm) in soil 1,4-Dioxane 0.13 ppm Metals in parts per million (ppm) in soil Chromium/Hexavalent 16.0 ppm Lead 113.0 ppm Metals in parts per (ppb) 6.3 ppb Iron 2,340 ppb Sodium 39,500 ppb Other contaminants detected at the site are not considered a health and safety concern because the concentrations were below the NYSDEC Part 375- 6.8(a) Unrestricted Use Soil Cleanup Objectives or the NYSDEC Groundwater Quality Standards. This CHASP is prepared for soil excavation . 2.1 Proposed Field Activities The field activities will be conducted at the site with the overall objectives of pe rforming soil excavation . The routes of potential exposure include inhalation, ingestion, and adsorption through dermal contact. Since intrusive field activities ( soil excavation ) are not anticipated to disturb any known source areas where elevated concentrations of petroleum constituents may be encountered, it is not anticipated that site activities will pose a hazard to field personnel. All proposed work will be completed in Leve l D PPE. Ambient air will be monitored using a photoionization detector (PID) for the petroleum compounds during any intrusive field activities (soil excavation ). Upgrading to Level C PPE (air -purifying respirators) will be considered if ambient air conc entrations exceed appropriate guidelines. Guidance for Level s C and D are summarized in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4, respectively. Hard hats, hearing protection, gloves, and steel -toed safety boots will also be required during soil excavation activities . Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y.

All designees will be familiar with all aspects of the CHASP and their responsibilities. 4.0 Levels of Protection Anyone entering the site must be protected against potential hazards. The purpose of the personal prote ction clothing and equipment is to minimize exposure to hazards while working on site. Careful selection and use of adequate PPE should protect the respiratory system, skin, eyes, face, hands, feet, head, body and hearing of all personnel. The appropriate level of protection is determined prior to the initial entry on site based on available information and preliminary monitoring of the site. Subsequent information may warrant changes in the original level selected. Appropriate equipment to protect personnel against exposure to known or anticipated chemical hazards has been divided into four categories (Levels A, B, C and D) according to the degree of protection afforded (highest protection to least protection). The following subsections provide a general overview of the various levels of personal protection and their generic requirements associated with each (Level A, B, C and D), that are available for potential use during hazardous waste operations. Determination of the site specific level s of protection, and the rationale for selection is described in section 6.0 of this CHASP . 4.1 Level A Protection The highest degree of protection is used in a Level A situation. It should be worn when the highest available level of respiratory, skin a nd eye protection is needed. This level of protection is placed in effect when there is no historic information about the site and it is assumed that the worst possible conditions exist. 4.1.1 Personal Protective Equipment a.

Total atmospheric concentrations of unidentified vapors or gases in the breathing zone are below established concentration levels on a photoionization detector or other monitoring instrument. 4.4.4 Minimum Decontamination Procedure Station 1: Equipment drop. Station 2: Hand and face wash. 4.5 Duration of Work Period The anticipated duration of the work period will be established prior to daily activities. The work will only be performed during daylight hours. Other factors that may affect the length of time personnel may work include: a. Air supply consumption (However, SCBA assisted work - Level A and Level B is not anticipated); b. Suit/ensemble, air purifying chemical cartridge, permeation and penetration by chemical contaminants; and c. Ambient temperature and weather conditions. d. Contractual requirements. 4.5.1 Air Supply Consumption The duration of the air supply must be considere d before any SCBA -assisted work activity commences (However, SCBA assisted work - Level A and Level B is not anticipated). Although the anticipated operating time of an SCBA is clearly indicated on the breathing apparatus the following variables should be considered and work actions and operating time adjusted accordingly: Work Rate: The actual in -use duration of SCBAs may be reduced by one -third to one -half during strenuous work, e.g. drum handling, major lifting or any task requiring repetitive speed o f motion. Fitness: Well conditioned individuals generally utilize oxygen more efficiently and can extract more oxygen from a given volume of air than unfit individuals, thereby slightly increasing the SCBA operating time. Body Size: Larger individuals ge nerally consume air at a higher rate than smaller individuals, thereby decreasing the SCBA operating time. Breathing Patterns: Quick, shallow or irregular breaths consume air more rapidly than deep, regular spaced breaths. Heat induced anxiety and lack of acclimatization may induce hyperventilation, resulting in decreased SCBA operating times. It is not anticipated that site conditions warranting use of SCBAs will be encountered during the field activities. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 10 Sustainable Management LLC 4.5.2 Suit/Ensemble, Air Purifying Chemical Cartridge, Permeation and Penetration The possibility of chemical permeation or penetration of chemical protective clothing (CPC) ensembles and air purifying respirators (APR) chemical cartridges during the work period is always a matter of concern and may limit work period duration. No single clothing material is an effective barrier to all chemicals or all combinations of chemicals, and no material is an effective barrier to prolonged chemical exposure. Manufacturer recommendations should be followed. In addition, when performing work in Level C respiratory protection, care shall be taken to inspect the respirators prior to usage. The chemical cartridges should be changed, at a minimum, on a daily basis, or when the cartridge becomes dirty, damaged or when breakthrough is suspected. 4.5.3 Ambient Temperature The ambient temperature has a major influence on work period duration as it affects both the worker and the protective integrity of ensembles (see section 11.4.1) as well as the operation of the mo nitoring equipment. When ambient temperatures rise or fall to a level which may hinder personnel performance or becomes a threat to personal safety, consideration should be given to stop work and recommence work when temperatures or conditions are less se vere. 5.0 Ambient Air Monitoring The presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) will be evaluated using a photoionization detector (PID). Air monitoring shall be required during all intrusive activities (drilling of s oil borings) being conducted on si te. Ambient air quality monitoring will be performed continuously in the Work/Exclusion Zone and the Contamination Reduction Zone (see section 7.0). PID measurements shall be recorded hourly if levels are within 5 ppm of the background concentration. If concentrations remain greater than 5 ppm above background in the breathing zone, an upgrade in respiratory protection will be warranted. For PID readings above 5 ppm of background levels, readings shall be recorded in 15 minute intervals or whenever a new high PID reading is encountered. In addition, periodic air monitoring will be conducted in the Support Zone. Readings taken with a PID will be recorded every hour. The PID used for ambient air monitoring shall be calibrated at the start and finish of each workday. Calibration will be performed using Isobutylene gas in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. If necessary, the level of personal protection required will be upgraded based upon ambient air monitoring results. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 11 Sustainable Management LLC 6.0 Determination of the Site- Specific Level of Hazard and Level of Protection Categories of personnel protection required depend on the degree of hazard and probability of exposure by a route of entry into the body. For this site, the potential route s of entry are via inhalation , ingestion and dermal adsorption of contaminants released from drilling of soil borings, soil and groundwater investigation and sampling activities. Based upon information on the site generated to date, it is anticipated that Level D will be required for site activities. The determination of Level D protection is based on the fact that field work will be performed in open, well -ventilated areas and that the potential for accidents and injuries due to obstructions caused by and/or magnified by the use of level A, B, or C protection (i.e., slip/trip hazards) is greater than the potential for problems associated with potential exposure from suspected contaminants using Level D protect ion. Should conditions change, re - evaluation of personnel protection will be conducted. The following PPE are required for Level D: General work clothes or coveralls. Gloves. Disposable chemical resistant gloves (neoprene, nitrile, etc.) are required du ring soil and groundwater sampling or other direct contact. Otherwise during other activities such as soil excavation with heavy equipment, leather gloves may be worn due to no chemical hazards. Boots/shoes, leather or chemical -resistant, steel toe and sh ank. Boots (outer), chemical -resistant (disposable) are optional; and may be worn if site conditions are wet or muddy. Safety glasses or chemical splash goggles are required when there is a splash hazard or hazard from flying debris. Hard hat must be worn in the vicinity of all heavy equipment and during situations or activities that may pose a potential for head injuries (suspended loads). Face shields must be worn when there is a splash hazard. High -visibility vests must be worn when working in high traf fic areas. A PID will be used to monitor air quality throughout the course of field work. If PID readings recorded within the breathing zone during site activity are sustained at levels of 50 ppm above background concentrations, activities will be halted and the Work/Exclusion Zone will be evacuated. Monitoring of the Work/Exclusion Zone will continue until readings fall within 5 ppm of the background concentration. If concentrations are sust ained at 5 ppm above background in the breathing zone, consideration will be given to upgrading the level of protection to Level C. An upgrade to the appropriate level of protection for field personnel will be required before re- entering the Work/Exclusio n Zone. The Site Health and Safety Officer will be responsible for requesting an upgrade in the level of personnel protection. The final decision will be made by the Health and Safety Manager in conjunction with management personnel at Sustainable Management LLC and the appropriate regulatory authorities. Use of 50 ppm as the criteria for respiratory protection upgrade to Level C is conservative for this site since the OSHA Permissible Exposure Limits and ACGIH Threshold Limit Values for Leaded Gasoline and Heating Oil are 300 ppm and 400 ppm, respectively. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 12 Sustainable Management LLC In addition to potential chemical hazards, there also exist potentially greater physical hazards associated with activities at the site. The excavation equipment and trucks will be on the site during the soil excavation . Therefore, all personnel should always be aware of vehicular traffic while working at the site. Further, hard hats must be worn at all times around heavy equipment and/or in the vicinity of suspended loads. All work must be perform ed in strict accordance with OSHA regulations. 7.0 Designated Work Zone Work zones will be determined prior to commencement of field activities. An area large enough to encompass the activity will be demarcated as the Work/Exclusion Zone. If necessary, the Work/Exclusion Zone will be demarcated with temporary barriers. Only qualified field personnel with the proper PPE and training will be allowed into the designated zone. Within the Work/Exclusion Zone, ambient air quality will be periodically monitored using a PID to determine any changes from background air quality. If subsequent measurements suggest a significant change in air quality, the work area will be immediately evacuated. An upgrade to the appropriate level of PPE for field personnel will be required before re- entering the Work/ Exclusion Zone. 8.0 Decontamination Stations Decontamination stations will be located within the Contaminant Reduction Zone to be used for the cleaning of all heavy equipment, vehicles, tools and supplies required for completion of field activities. Personnel decontamination procedures for the appropriate levels of protection are described in section 4.0. 9.0 Site Access Control Appropriate traffic controls (traffic cones and other barricades) will be used in areas of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to provide safe work areas for the protection of both field workers and the public. 10.0 Personal Hygiene The following personal hygiene rules must be followed while performing work at the site: Eating, drinking, chewing gum or tobacco, smoking, or any other practice that increases the probability of hand- to-mouth transfer and ingestion of material is prohibited in the work area. Hands and face must be thoroughly washed upon leaving the work area and before eating, drinking, or any other activities. Whenever decontamination procedures for outer garments are in effect, the entire body should be thoroughly washed as soon as possible after the protective garment is removed. No excessive facial hair (i.e. beards), which interferes with a satisfactory fit of the mask -to-face seal, is allowed on personnel required to wear respiratory protective equipment. Contact with contaminated or suspected contaminated surfaces will be avoided. Whenever possible, walking through puddl es, mud and discolored surfaces, Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 13 Sustainable Management LLC kneeling on the ground, leaning, sitting or placing equipment on containers or vehicles, or the ground will be avoided. Medicine and alcohol can increase the effects from exposure to toxic chemicals. Prescribed drugs will not be taken by personnel on site where the potential for absorption, inhalation, or ingestion of toxic substances exists unless specifically approved by a qualified physician. Alcoholic beverage intake will be prohibited during all on- site field activities. 11.0 Contingency Plan The Contingency Plan in section 11.0 has been developed to identify precautionary measures, possible emergency conditions , and emergency procedures. The Contingency Plan shall be implemented by the Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO). 11.1 Emergency Medical Care and Treatment Site specific emergency medical care and treatment of field personnel, resulting from possible exposures to toxic substances and injuries due to accidents is provided in Appendix 2. The requirements include: a. Name, address and telephone number of the nearest medical treatment facility will be conspicuously posted. Directions for locating the facility, plus the travel time will be readily available. b. Names and telephone numbers of ambulance service, po lice and fire departments, and procedures for obtaining these services will be conspicuously posted. c. Procedure for prompt notification of the Site Health and Safety Officer . Material Safety Data Sheets for site related suspected contaminants (Leaded Gasoline, Heating Oil) and materials to be brought on site for calibration and lab preservat ion purposes (Isobutylene Gas, Hydrochloric Acid, Nitric Acid) are provided (see Appendix 3). In addition, the following emergency equipment will be avai lable at the site at all times when the field activities are being performed: 1. First aid equipment will be available on site for minor injuries. 2. Readily available dry -chemical fire extinguisher. 11.2 Off-Site Emergency Medical Care The Site Health and S afety Officer shall pre -arrange for access to emergency medical care services at a convenient and readily accessible medical facility and establish emergency routes. The Site Health and Safety Officer shall establish emergency communications with emergenc y response services. 11.3 Personnel Accidents Bodily injuries which occur as a result of an accident during the operation at the site will be handled in the following manner: Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 14 Sustainable Management LLC a. First aid equipment will be available on site for minor injuries. If the injur ies are not considered minor, proceed to the next step. b. The local paramedic unit, local hospital and the Site Health and Safety Officer shall be notified of the nature of the emergency. c. The injured employee shall be transported by an emergency vehicle to t he local hospital. d. Contact the Site Health and Safety Officer and Health and Safety Manager and management personnel for Sustainable Management LLC and subcontractors. e. A written report shall be prepared by the Site Health and Safety Officer detailing the events and actions taken during the emergency within 24 hours of the accident. f. The Site Health and Safety Officer will conduct a safety meeting with site personnel prior to continuing field activities . 11.4 Personnel Exposure In the event that any pers on is splashed or otherwise excessively contaminated by chemicals, the following procedure will be undertaken: a. Disposable clothing contaminated with observable amounts of chemicals residue is to be removed and replaced immediately. b. In the event of direct skin contact in Level D, the affected area is to be washed immediately with soap and water, or other solutions as directed by medical personnel. c. The Site Health and Safety Officer or other individuals who hold a current first aid certificate will determine the immediate course of action to be undertaken. This may involve using the first aid kit. 11.4.1 Weather Adverse weather conditions are an important consideration in planning and conducting site operations. Hot or cold weather can cause physical discomfort, loss of efficiency, and personal injury. Of particular importance is heat stress resulting when protective clothing decreases natural body ventilation. One or more of the following will help reduce heat stress: a. Provide plenty of liquids. To repl ace body fluids (water and electrolytes) lost because of sweating, use a 0.1 percent salt water solution, more heavily salted foods, or commercial mixes. b. Provide cooling devices to aid natural body ventilation. These devices, however add weight, and the ir use should be balanced against worker efficiency. Long cotton underwear helps absorb moisture and protect the skin from direct contact with heat absorbent protective clothing. c. Install mobile showers and/or hose down facilities to reduce body temperatur e and cool protective clothing. d. In extremely hot weather, conduct operations in the early morning or evening. e. Ensure that adequate shelter is available to protect personnel against heat, cold, rain, snow, etc. f. In hot weather, rotate shifts of workers weari ng impervious clothing. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 15 Sustainable Management LLC 11.4.2 Heat Stress If field operations are conducted in the warm summer months, heat related fatigue will be closely monitored. Monitoring of personnel wearing impervious clothing or wearing respiratory protection shall commence when the ambient temperature is 70 degrees Fahrenheit or above. Frequency of monitoring should increase as the ambient temperature increases or as slow recovery rates are indicated. When temperatures exceed 85 degrees Fahrenheit, workers should be monitored for heat stress after every work period. The following screening mechanism will be used to monitor for heat stress: Heart Rate (HR) will be periodically measured by the radial pulse for 30 seconds during a resting period. The HR should not exceed 110 beats per minute. If the HR is higher, the next work period should be shortened by 33 percent. If the pulse rate is 100 beats per minute at the beginning of the next rest period, the following work cycle should be shortened by 33 percent. Heat related illnesses range from heat fatigue to heat stroke, the most serious. Heat stroke requires prompt treatment to prevent irreversible damage or death. Protective clothing may have to be cut off. Less serious forms of heat stress require prompt attention or they may lead to heat stroke. Unless the victim is obviously contaminated, decontamination should be omitted or minimized and treatment begun immediately. Heat- related problems can be categorized as: Heat Rash: Caused by continuous exposure to hot and humid air and aggravated by chafing clothes. Decreases ability to tolerate heat as well as being a nuisance. Heat Cramps: Caused by profuse perspiration with inadequate fluid intake and chemical replacement (especially salts). Signs: muscle spasm and pain in the extremities and abdomen. Heat Exhaustion: Caused by increased stress on various organs to meet increased demands to cool the body. Signs: shallow breathing, pale, cool moist skin, profuse sweating, dizziness, and lassitude. Heat Stroke: The most s evere form of heat stress. The body must be cooled immediately to prevent severe injury and/or death. Signs and symptoms are: red, hot, dry skin, no perspiration, nausea, dizziness and confusion, strong rapid pulse, coma. Some of the symptoms of heat st ress are: hot dry skin, fever, nausea, cramps, red or spotted skin, confusion, lightheadedness, delirium, rapid pulse, convulsions and unconsciousness. For workers suffering from heat stress, the following actions should be taken: 1. Remove the victim to a c ool area. 2. Loosen clothing . 3. Thoroughly soak the victim in cool water or apply cold compresses . 4. Call for medical assistance. 11.4.3 Cold Stress If field operations are conducted in the cold winter months, cold stress will be monitored. Two factors that influence the development of cold injury: ambient temperature and the velocity of the Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 16 Sustainable Management LLC wind. Wind chill is used to describe the chilling effect of moving air in combination with low temperature. For instance, 10 degrees Fahrenheit air with a wind of 15 miles per hour is equivalent in chilling effect to still air at - 18 degrees Fahrenheit. As a general rule, the greatest incremental increase in win d chill occurs when a wind of 5 miles per hour (mph) increase s to 10 mph. Additionally, water conducts heat 240 times faster than air. Thus, the body cools suddenly when chemical -protective equipment is removed if the clothing underneath is soaked with pe rspiration. Local injury resulting from cold is included in the generic term frostbite. There are several degrees of damage. Frostbite usually affects feet, hands, nose, and ears. Frostbite of the extremities can be categorized as: Frost Nip or Incipient Fros tbite: Characterized by sudden blanching or whitening of skin. Superficial Frostbite: Skin has a waxy or white appearance and is firm to the touch, but tissue beneath is resilient . Deep Frostbite: Tissues are cold, pale and solid; extremely serious injury. Hypothermia: Systemic hypothermia is caused by exposure to freezing or rapidly dropping temperatures. Its symptoms are usually exhibited in five stages: (1) shivering; (2) apathy, listlessness, sleepiness, and sometimes rapid cooling of the body temperature to less th an 95 degrees Fahrenheit; (3) unconsciousness, glassy stare, slow pulse and slow respiratory rate; (4) freezing of the extremities; and finally, (5) death. When the ambient temperature is 36 degrees Fahrenheit or below, workers who are immersed in water or whose clothing becomes wet should immediately change to dry clothing and be treated for hypothermia. For workers suffering from the symptoms of cold injury, the following actions should be taken: 1. Remove the victim to a warm area. 2. Wrap victim in a coa t or blanket . 3. Call for medical assistance. 11.5 Fire The telephone number of the local fire department will be posted along with other emergency numbers conspicuously on- site at all times (see Appendix 2). In the event of a fire occurring at the site, th e following actions will be undertaken, and generally initiated by the Site Health and Safety Officer: a) Evacuate all unnecessary personnel from the area of the fire and site, if necessary. b) Contact the local fire and police departments informing them of the fire and any injuries if they have occurred. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 17 Sustainable Management LLC c) Contact the local hospital of the possibility of fire victims. d) Contact the Site Health and Safety Officer and Health and Safety Manager and management personnel for Sustainable Management LLC and subcontractors . e) The Site Health and Safety Officer will conduct a safety meeting with site personnel prior to continuing field activities. 11.6 Personnel Protective Equipment Failure If any site worker experiences a failure or alteration of PPE that affects the prote ction factor, that person shall immediately leave the Work/Exclusion Zone. Reentry shall not be permitted until the equipment has been repaired or replaced to the satisfaction of the Site Health and Safety Officer. 11.7 Spill Prevention and Containment Onsite personnel shall be adequately trained in the operation and maintenance of equipment used on the site. Equipment shall be inspected on a daily basis to minimize the potential for spillage of equipment related fluids. Personnel shall also be adequate ly trained to recognize and respond to a spill situation. Absorbent materials will be maintained on -site for potential spill containment and mitigation. 12.0 Summary This CHASP has been prepared for performing field activities (soil excavation at the site ). The appropriate level of protection is determined prior to the initial entry on site based on available information and preliminary monitoring of the site. Subsequent information may warrant changes in the original level selected. There are no kno wn contaminants of concern at the site. During the soil excavation, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and metals as shown in Section 2.0 above will be considered contaminants for the site. Material Safety Data Sheets for site related suspected contamin ants and materials brought on site are provided. The routes of potential exposure include inhalation, ingestion, and adsorption through dermal contact. All proposed work will be completed in Level D Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The determination of Level D protection is based on the fact that field work will be performed in open, well -ventilated areas and that the potential for accidents and injuries due to obstructions caused by and/or magnified by the use of level A, B, or C protection (i.e., slip/trip hazards) is greater than the potential for problems associated with potential exposure from contaminants using Level D protection. Level D PPE includes: General work clothes or coveralls; Gloves. Disposable chemical resistant gloves (neopren e, nitrile, etc.) are required during soil and groundwater sampling or other direct contact. Otherwise during other activities such as soil excavation with heavy equipment, leather gloves may be worn due to no chemical hazards. Boots/shoes, leather or chemical -resistant, steel toe and shank. Boots (outer), chemical -resistant (disposable) are optional; and may be worn if site conditions are wet or muddy. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 18 Sustainable Management LLC Safety glasses or chemical splash goggles are required when there is a splash hazard or hazard from flying debris. Hard hat must be worn in the vicinity of all heavy equipment and during situations or activities that may pose a potential for head injuries (suspended loads). Face shields must be worn when there is a splash hazard. Minimum decontamination procedures for Level D PPE include equipment removal and hand and face wash. Ambient air will be monitored using a photoionization detector (PID) during any intrusive field activities (drilling of soil borings). If necessary, the level of personal p rotection required will be upgraded based upon ambient air monitoring results. PID measurements shall be recorded every hour, at a minimum, if readings are within 5 ppm of background levels. If PID readings deviate from within 5 ppm of background, the re adings shall be recorded every 15 minutes or whenever a new PID reading is encountered. If PID readings are sustained at levels of 5 0 ppm above background concentrations, activities will be halted and the Work Zone will be evacuated. Monitoring of the Work Zone will continue until PID readings fall within 5 ppm of the background concentration and consideration will be given to upgrading to Level C PPE (air - purifying respirators). In addition to potential chemical hazards, there also exist potentially greater physical hazards associated with activities at the site. A ll personnel should always be aware of vehicular traffic . Hard hats, hearing protection, gloves, and steel -toed safety boots will be required during intrusive activities. Pursuant to 29 CFR 1910.120, each individual involved in field activities potentially exposing them to hazardous substances and/or situations have received 40 -hours of OSHA HAZWOPER training as well as medical surveillance. The Health and Safety Manager and Site Health and Safety Officer shall be responsible for overall implementation and coordination of the Health and Safety Program for field personnel at the site. The Health and Safety Manager is Chunyuan Li (646- 380-1939) of Sustainable Management LLC . The Site Health and Safety Officer (SHSO) is Chunyuan Li (646- 380-1939) of Sustainable Management LLC . If the Site Health and Safety Office r must leave the project site, he may designate another qualified employee as an alternate Site Health and Safety Officer. The anticipated duration of the work period will be established prior to daily activities. The work will only be performed during daylight hours. Ambient temperature and weather conditions should also be considered. When ambient temperatures rise or fall to a level which may hinder personnel performance or becomes a threat to personal safety, consideration should be given to stop work and recommence work when temperatures or conditions are less severe. The following personal hygiene rules must be followed while performing work at the site: Eating, drinking, chewing gum or tobacco, smoking, or any other practice that increases the probability of hand- to-mouth transfer and ingestion of material is prohibited in the work area. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y. Page 19 Sustainable Management LLC Hands and face mu st be thoroughly washed upon leaving the work area and before eating, drinking, or any other activities. Whenever decontamination procedures for outer garments are in effect, the entire body should be thoroughly washed as soon as possible after the protect ive garment is removed. No excessive facial hair (i.e. beards), which interferes with a satisfactory fit of the mask -to- face seal, is allowed on personnel required to wear respiratory protective equipment. Contact with contaminated or suspected contaminate d surfaces will be avoided. Whenever possible, walking through puddles, mud and discolored surfaces, kneeling on the ground, leaning, sitting or placing equipment on containers or vehicles, or the ground will be avoided. Medicine and alcohol can increase the effects from exposure to toxic chemicals. Prescribed drugs will not be taken by personnel on site where the potential for absorption, inhalation, or ingestion of toxic substances exists unless specifically approved by a qualified physician. Alcoholic beverage intake will be prohibited during all on- site field activities. Emergency equipment including first aid equipment and a dry -chemical fire extinguisher will be available on site. Site specific emergency contacts including a route map to the ho spital are provided. Health & Safety Plan, Maimonides Medical Center, Brooklyn, N.Y.

Thoroughly clean shoes before reuse. Get medical attention immediately. Eye Contact: Immediately flush eyes with pl enty of water for at least 15 minutes, lifting lower and upper eyelids occasionally. Get medi cal attention immediately. 5. Fire Fighting Measures Fire: Not combustible, but substance is a strong oxidizer and its heat of reacti on with reducing agents or combustibles may cause ignition. Can react with metals to release flammable hydrogen gas. Explosion: Reacts explosively with combustible organic or readily oxidizable as: alcohols, turpentine, charcoal, organic refuse, metal powde r, hydrogen sulfide, etc. Reacts with most metals to release hydrogen gas which can form explosive mixtures with air. Fire Extinguishing Media: Water spray may be used to keep fire exposed containers cool. Do not get water inside container. Special Information: Increases the flammability of combustible, organi c and readily oxidizable materials. In the event of a fire, wear full protective clothing and NIOSH-approved self -contained breathing apparatus with full facepiece operated in the pressure demand or other positive pressure mode. 6. Accidental Release Measures Ventilate area of leak or spill. Wear appropriate personal protective equipment as specified in Section 8. Isolate hazard area. Keep unnece ssary and unprotected personnel from entering. Contain and recover liquid when possible. Neutra lize with alkaline materi al (soda ash, lime), then absorb with an inert material (e. g., vermic ulite, dry sand, earth), and place in a chemical waste container. Do not use combustible materials, such as saw dust. Do not flush to sewer! US Regulations (CERCLA) require repo rting spills and releases to so il, water and air in excess of reportable quantities. The toll free number for the US Coast Guard National Response Center is (800) 424-8802. J. T. Baker NEUTRASORB\u00ae acid neutralizers ar e recommended for spills of this product. 7. Handling and Storage Store in a cool, dry, ventilated storage area with acid resistant floors and good drainage. Protect from physical damage. Keep out of direct sunlight and away from heat, water, and incompatible materials. Do not wash out container and use it for other purposes. When diluting, the acid should always be added slowly to water and in small amounts. Never use hot water and never add water to the acid. Water added to aci d can cause uncontrolled boiling and splashing. Containers of this material may be hazardous when empty since they retain product residues (vapors, liquid); observe all warnings and precautions listed for the product. 8. Exposure Controls /Personal Protection Airborne Exposure Limits: -OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL): 2 ppm (TWA), ppm (STEL) Ventilation System: A system of local and/or gene ral exhaust is recommended to k eep employee exposures below the Airborne Exposure Limits. Local exhaust ventilati on is generally preferre d because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, pr eventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices , most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): If the exposure limit is exceeded, wear a supplied air, full-facepiece resp irator, airlined hood, or full-facepiece self-contained breathing apparatus. Nitric acid is an oxidi zer and should not come in contact with cartridges and canisters that c ontain oxidizable material s, such as activated charcoal. Canister-type respirators using sorbents are ineffective. Skin Protection: Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, la b coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact. Eye Protection: Use chemical safety goggles and/or a full face shield where splashing is possible. Maintain eye wash fountain and quick-drench facilities in work area. 9.

Other Toxic Effects on Humans: Slightly hazardous in case of skin contact (irritant), of ingestion, of inhalation. Special Remarks on Toxicity to Animals: Not available. Special Remarks on Chronic Effects on Humans: Not available. Special Remarks on other Toxic Effects on Humans: Acute Potential Health Effects: Skin: Iron metal filings or dust: May cause skin irritation by mechanical action. Iron metal wire: Not likely to cause skin irritation Eyes: Iron metal filings or dust: Can irritate eyes by mechanical action. Iron metal wire: No hazard. Will not cause eye irritation. Inhalation: Iron dust: Can irritate the respiratory tract by mechanical action. Iron metal wire or filings: Not an inhalation hazard unless metal is heated. If metal is heated, fumes will be released. Inhalation of these fumes may cause \"fume metal fever\", which is characterized by flu-like symptoms. Symptoms may include metallic taste, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, cough, weakness, chest pain, generalized muscle pain/aches, and increased white blood cell count. Ingestion: Iron metal wire: Not an ingestion hazard: Iron metal filings or dust: The amount of ingested iron which constitutes a toxic dose is not well defined. Proposed toxic doses of elemental iron are 20 mg/kg for gastrointestinal irritation to greater than 60 mg/kg for systemic toxicity. Gastrointestinal effects are the first signs to appear, with hemorrhagic vomiting and diarrhea, hematochezia, abdominal pain, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, coagulaopathy, shock, coma and convulsions developing from 0 to 6 hours after ingestion. Leukocytosis may also occur. An asymptomatic phase may ensue at 6 to 12 hours postingestion, followed by hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, hepatic and renal failure, severe acidosis, cyanosis, fever, CNS depression (lethargy, restlessness and/or confusion seizures), hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse/cardiac failure in 12 to 48 hours. Hepatic cirrhosis, gastrointestinal scarring and/or strictures may arise in 2 to 6 weeks. It may also cause an anaphylactoid reaction. Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema also develop in severe cases of iron intoxication. Chronic Potential Health Effects: Inhalation: Chronic inhalation of iron dust can lead to accumulation in the lungs and a characteristic stippled appearance on X-rays. This condition, called SIDEROSIS, is considered benign in that it does not interfere with lung function and does not predispose to other disease. Chronic inhalation of iron dust may also cause fibrosis in the lungs. Ingestion: Clinical signs of iron overload appear when the total body iron is 5 to 10 times higher than normal. Neurobehavioral defects including depression, decreased activity, habituation, reflex startle, and conditioned avoidance response performance may occur. However, similiar effects were also seen in iron defficiency. It is therefore likely that these behavioral effects are secondary to general toxicity. High serum iron levels may be associated with an increased risk of fatal acute myocardial infarction (MI). Skin: Prolonged or repeated contact may cause hypersensivity.

Ar eas in which exposure to lead metal or lead compounds may occur should be identified by signs or appropriate means, and access to the area should be limited to authorized persons. Containers of this material may be hazardous when empty since they retain product residues (dust, solids); observe all wa rnings and precautions listed for the product. 8. Exposure Controls /Personal Protection Airborne Exposure Limits: For lead, metal and inorganic dusts and fumes, as Pb: -OSHA Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL): 0.05 mg/m3 (TWA) For lead, elemental and inorganic compounds, as Pb: -ACGIH Threshold Limit Value (TLV): 0.05 mg/m3 (TWA), A3 animal carcinogen ACGIH Biological Exposure Indices (BEI): 30 ug/100ml, notation B (see actual Indices for more information). For lead, inorganic: -NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit (REL): 0.1 mg/m3 (TWA) Ventilation System: A system of local and/or gene ral exhaust is recommended to k eep employee exposures below the Airborne Exposure Limits. Local exhaust ventilati on is generally preferre d because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, pr eventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices , most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): If the exposure limit is exceeded and engineer ing controls are not f easible, a half-face high efficiency particulate respirator (NIOSH type N100 filter) may be worn for up to ten times the exposure limit or the maximum use concentration sp ecified by the appropriate regulatory agency or respirator supplier, whichever is lowest. A full-face piece high efficiency particulate respirator (NIOSH type N100 filter) may be worn up to 50 times the exposure limit, or the maximum use concentration specified by the appropriate regulato ry agency or respirator supplier, whichever is lowest. If oil particles (e.g. lubr icants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. For emergenc ies or instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a full-facepiece positive-pressure, air-supplied re spirator. WARNING: workers in oxygen-deficient atmospheres. Skin Protection: Wear impervious protective clothing, including boots, gloves, la b coat, apron or coveralls, as appropriate, to prevent skin contact. Eye Protection: Use chemical safety goggles and/or full face shield where dusting or splashing of solutions is possible. Maintain eye wash fountain and quick-drench facilities in work area. Other Control Measures: Eating, drinking, and smoking should not be permitted in areas where solids or liquids containing lead compounds are handled, processed, or stored.
