This- this includes half an hour before & afterward (so NOT between 5:.30-6:.30 or 11:.30-12:.30 for both am & pm)!\" 3 Spiritual Cleansing Baths To begin, clean the tub carefully. Take a shower before taking the ritual bath. Then, wash thoroughly with positive energy in the following ways. Salt Water Bath There's nothing more relaxing than a nice, hot bath, and by adding saltwater, you can gain even more benefits for your skin. There's a reason why they say that floating in the Dead Sea is so good for your skin, because the high salt content helps repair damaged cells, stimulate blood flow, and provides for a general detox. Bath salts such as Epsom salts are also an option as these contain other minerals that benefit the skin such as magnesium potassium. - Make sure you won't be disturbed for at least an hour. Optional: light candles or incense or play relaxing music. Utilize what makes your aura lighter. - Fill your bath with warm water. The level is up to you. [Don't make it too hot](https://www.gaia.com/article/guide-best-bath-youve-ever-had). - Add 2-3 good handfuls of salt. Use a good quality unprocessed salt, such as unrefined sea salt or Himalayan salt. Do not use regular table salt, as this has added anti-caking agents and has been refined, which removes beneficial minerals. - Optional: Add a few drops of pure essential oils for aromatherapy purposes. Lavender is a good choice, as it will also help you to relax and unwind, and is generally very safe. - Soak for about 20-30 minutes. While you do so, make it your intention to let go of all negativity. You can pray for the release of any energy that you no longer wish to carry, or that is not for your highest good. You can also ask for spiritual support to raise your spiritual vibration. - For the best results, air dry when you get out of the bath. You may use a towel for your head and put a robe on, but do not towel dry. If possible, don't take another shower or bath for 24 hours. - Take a saltwater bath no more than once a week. As noted, once a month may be the perfect amount of time in between. By following these seven steps you'll be able to not only remove negative energy spiritually, but you'll give yourself a nice physical detox from any buildup of toxins your skin might have accumulated.
