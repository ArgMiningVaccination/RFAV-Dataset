(c)(e) General assistance medical care is not available for a person in a correctional facility unless the person is detained by law for less than one year in a county correctional or detention facility as a person accused or convicted of a crime, or admitted as an inpatient to a hospital on a criminal hold order, and the person is a recipient of general assistance medical care at the time the person is detained by law or admitted on a criminal hold order and as long as the person continues to meet other eligibility requirements of this subdivision. (d)(f) General assistance medical care is not available for applicants or recipients who do not cooperate with the county agency to meet the requirements of medical assistance. General assistance medical care is limited to payment of emergency services only for applicants or recipients as described in paragraph (a), clause (4), whose MinnesotaCare coverage is denied or terminated for nonpayment of premiums as required by sections 256.9356 to 256.9358. (e)(g) In determining the amount of assets of an individual, there shall be included any asset or interest in an asset, including an asset excluded under paragraph (a), that was given away, sold, or disposed of for less than fair market value within the 60 months preceding application for general assistance medical care or during the period of eligibility. Any transfer described in this paragraph shall be presumed to have been for the purpose of establishing eligibility for general assistance medical care, unless the individual furnishes convincing evidence to establish that the transaction was exclusively for another purpose. For purposes of this paragraph, the value of the asset or interest shall be the fair market value at the time it was given away, sold, or disposed of, less the amount of compensation received. For any uncompensated transfer, the number of months of ineligibility, including partial months, shall be calculated by dividing the uncompensated transfer amount by the average monthly per person payment made by the medical assistance program to skilled nursing facilities for the previous calendar year. The individual shall remain ineligible until this fixed period has expired. The period of ineligibility may exceed 30 months, and a reapplication for benefits after 30 months from the date of the transfer shall not result in eligibility unless and until the period of ineligibility has expired. The period of ineligibility begins in the month the transfer was reported to the county agency, or if the transfer was not reported, the month in which the county agency discovered the transfer, whichever comes first. For applicants, the period of ineligibility begins on the date of the first approved application. (f)(1)(h) Beginning October 1, 1993, an undocumented alien or a nonimmigrant is ineligible for general assistance medical care other than emergency services. For purposes of this subdivision, a nonimmigrant is an individual in one or more of the classes listed in United States Code, title 8, section 1101(a)(15), and an undocumented alien is an individual who resides in the United States without the approval or acquiescence of the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

[TRANSITION PLAN FOR MINNESOTACARE ENROLLEES.] (a) The commissioner of human services, in consultation with the legislative commission on health care access and the commissioners of employee relations, health, and commerce, shall develop an implementation plan to transition higher-income MinnesotaCare enrollees to private sector or other nonsubsidized coverage. In developing the plan, the commissioner shall examine the feasibility of using the health insurance program for state employees administered by the commissioner of employee relations as a source of coverage, and shall also examine methods to increase the affordability of private sector coverage for individuals and families transitioning off MinnesotaCare. The commissioner shall submit the implementation plan to the legislature by December 15, 1997. (b) The commissioner of human services shall report to the legislature by January 15, 1998, on the impact of the outreach efforts for the MinnesotaCare program, and on the reasons why enrollees are leaving the MinnesotaCare program, and make recommendations on: (1) the affordability of the MinnesotaCare premium schedule; (2) the eligibility income level for the MinnesotaCare program that will result in the greatest number of individuals having health coverage; (3) what will encourage greater availability of health coverage in the private market; (4) steps to increase the availability of health coverage in the small employer market; (5) the need, if any, and the feasibility of increasing the MinnesotaCare program income eligibility level for individuals and households without children; and (6) the possibility of alternative premium payments and of waiving the premiums for the MinnesotaCare program for certain low-income enrollees. Sec. 21. [INPATIENT BENEFIT LIMIT PILOT PROJECT.] The commissioner of human services shall develop a pilot project in a designated area of the state to determine whether the presence of the $10,000 inpatient hospital benefit limit prevents erosion of the private health insurance market by eliminating the $10,000 inpatient benefit limit for that area of the state. The commissioner shall work with the legislative commission on health care access in designing the elements of the pilot project. Sec. 22. [EFFECTIVE DATE.] Section 3, subdivision 7, clause (1), is effective July 1, 1998. ARTICLE 2 MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES TO HEALTH CARE REFORM Section 1. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 60A.951, subdivision 5, is amended to read: Subd. 5. [INSURER.] \"Insurer\" means insurance company, risk retention group as defined in section 60E.02, service plan corporation as defined in section 62C.02, health maintenance organization as defined in section 62D.02, community integrated service network as defined in section 62N.02, fraternal benefit society regulated under chapter 64B, township mutual company regulated under chapter 67A, joint self-insurance plan or multiple employer trust regulated under chapter 60F, 62H, or section 471.617, subdivision 2, persons administering a self-insurance plan as defined in section 60A.23, subdivision 8, clause (2), paragraphs (a) and (d), and the workers' compensation reinsurance association established in section 79.34. Sec. 2. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 62A.021, subdivision 1, is amended to read: Subdivision 1. [LOSS RATIO STANDARDS.] (a) Notwithstanding section 62A.02, subdivision 3, relating to loss ratios, health care policies or certificates shall not be delivered or issued for delivery to an individual or to a small employer as defined in section 62L.02, unless the policies or certificates can be expected, as estimated for the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage, to return to Minnesota policyholders and certificate holders in the form of aggregate benefits not including anticipated refunds or credits, provided under the policies or certificates, (1) at least 75 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums earned in the case of policies issued in the small employer market, as defined in section 62L.02, subdivision 27, calculated on an aggregate basis; and (2) at least 65 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums earned in the case of each policy form or certificate form issued in the individual market; calculated on the basis of incurred claims experience or incurred health care expenses where coverage is provided by a health maintenance organization on a service rather than reimbursement basis and earned premiums for the period and according to accepted actuarial principles and practices. Assessments by the reinsurance association created in chapter 62L and anyall types of taxes, surcharges, or assessments created by Laws 1992, chapter 549, or created on or after April 23, 1992, are included in the calculation of incurred claims experience or incurred health care expenses. The applicable percentage for policies and certificates issued in the small employer market, as defined in section 62L.02, increases by one percentage point on July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1994, until an 82 percent loss ratio is reached on July 1, 2000. The applicable percentage for policy forms and certificate forms issued in the individual market increases by one percentage point on July 1 of each year, beginning on July 1, 1994, until a 72 percent loss ratio is reached on July 1, 2000. A health carrier that enters a market after July 1, 1993, does not start at the beginning of the phase-in schedule and must instead comply with the loss ratio requirements applicable to other health carriers in that market for each time period. Premiums earned and claims incurred in markets other than the small employer and individual markets are not relevant for purposes of this section. Notwithstanding section 645.26, any act enacted at the 1992 regular legislative session that amends or repeals section 62A.135 or that otherwise changes the loss ratios provided in that section is void.(b) All filings of rates and rating schedules shall demonstrate that actual expected claims in relation to premiums comply with the requirements of this section when combined with actual experience to date. Filings of rate revisions shall also demonstrate that the anticipated loss ratio over the entire future period for which the revised rates are computed to provide coverage can be expected to meet the appropriate loss ratio standards, and aggregate loss ratio from inception of the policy form or certificate form shall equal or exceed the appropriate loss ratio standards. (c) A health carrier that issues health care policies and certificates to individuals or to small employers, as defined in section 62L.02, in this state shall file annually its rates, rating schedule, and supporting documentation including ratios of incurred losses to earned premiums by policy form or certificate form duration for approval by the commissioner according to the filing requirements and procedures prescribed by the commissioner. The supporting documentation shall also demonstrate in accordance with actuarial standards of practice using reasonable assumptions that the appropriate loss ratio standards can be expected to be met over the entire period for which rates are computed. The demonstration shall exclude active life reserves. If the data submitted does not confirm that the health carrier has satisfied the loss ratio requirements of this section, the commissioner shall notify the health carrier in writing of the deficiency. The health carrier shall have 30 days from the date of the commissioner's notice to file amended rates that comply with this section. If the health carrier fails to file amended rates within the prescribed time, the commissioner shall order that the health carrier's filed rates for the nonconforming policy form or certificate form be reduced to an amount that would have resulted in a loss ratio that complied with this section had it been in effect for the reporting period of the supplement. The health carrier's failure to file amended rates within the specified time or the issuance of the commissioner's order amending the rates does not preclude the health carrier from filing an amendment of its rates at a later time. The commissioner shall annually make the submitted data available to the public at a cost not to exceed the cost of copying. The data must be compiled in a form useful for consumers who wish to compare premium charges and loss ratios. (d) Each sale of a policy or certificate that does not comply with the loss ratio requirements of this section is an unfair or deceptive act or practice in the business of insurance and is subject to the penalties in sections 72A.17 to 72A.32. (e)(1) For purposes of this section, health care policies issued as a result of solicitations of individuals through the mail or mass media advertising, including both print and broadcast advertising, shall be treated as individual policies. (2) For purposes of this section, (1)(i) \"health care policy\" or \"health care certificate\" is a health plan as defined in section 62A.011; and (2)(ii) \"health carrier\" has the meaning given in section 62A.011 and includes all health carriers delivering or issuing for delivery health care policies or certificates in this state or offering these policies or certificates to residents of this state. (f) The loss ratio phase-in as described in paragraph (a) does not apply to individual policies and small employer policies issued by a health plan company that is assessed less than three percent of the total annual amount assessed by the Minnesota comprehensive health association. These policies must meet a 68 percent loss ratio for individual policies, a 71 percent loss ratio for small employer policies with fewer than ten employees, and a 75 percent loss ratio for all other small employer policies. (g) The commissioners of commerce and health shall each annually issue a public report listing, by health plan company, the actual loss ratios experienced in the individual and small employer markets in this state by the health plan companies that the commissioners respectively regulate. The commissioners shall coordinate release of these reports so as to release them as a joint report or as separate reports issued the same day. The report or reports shall be released no later than June 1 for loss ratios experienced for the preceding calendar year. Health plan companies shall provide to the commissioners any information requested by the commissioners for purposes of this paragraph. Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 62A.021, is amended by adding a subdivision to read: Subd. 3. [LOSS RATIO DISCLOSURE.] (a) Each health care policy form or health care certificate form for which subdivision 1 requires compliance with a loss ratio requirement shall prominently display the disclosure provided in paragraph (b) on its declarations sheet if it has one and, if not, on its front page. The disclosure must also be prominently displayed in any marketing materials used in connection with it.

[FACTORS.] (a) [GENERALLY APPLICABLE FACTORS.] In making a determination about cost, access, and quality, the commissioner may consider the following factors, to the extent relevant: (1) whether the proposal is compatible with the cost containment plan or other plan of the Minnesota health care commission or theapplicable regional plans of the regional coordinating boards; (2) market structure: (i) actual and potential sellers and buyers, or providers and purchasers; (ii) actual and potential consumers; (iii) geographic market area; and (iv) entry conditions; (3) current market conditions; (4) the historical behavior of the market; (5) performance of other, similar arrangements; (6) whether the proposal unnecessarily restrains competition or restrains competition in ways not reasonably related to the purposes of this chapter; and (7) the financial condition of the applicant. (b) [COST.] The commissioner's analysis of cost must focus on the individual consumer of health care. Cost savings to be realized by providers, health carriers, group purchasers, or other participants in the health care system are relevant only to the extent that the savings are likely to be passed on to the consumer. However, where an application is submitted by providers or purchasers who are paid primarily by third party payers unaffiliated with the applicant, it is sufficient for the applicant to show that cost savings are likely to be passed on to the unaffiliated third party payers; the applicants do not have the burden of proving that third party payers with whom the applicants are not affiliated will pass on cost savings to individuals receiving coverage through the third party payers. In making determinations as to costs, the commissioner may consider: (1) the cost savings likely to result to the applicant; (2) the extent to which the cost savings are likely to be passed on to the consumer and in what form; (3) the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to result in cost shifting by the applicant onto other payers or purchasers of other products or services; (4) the extent to which the cost shifting by the applicant is likely to be followed by other persons in the market; (5) the current and anticipated supply and demand for any products or services at issue; (6) the representations and guarantees of the applicant and their enforceability; (7) likely effectiveness of regulation by the commissioner; (8) inferences to be drawn from market structure; (9) the cost of regulation, both for the state and for the applicant; and (10) any other factors tending to show that the proposed arrangement is or is not likely to reduce cost. (c) [ACCESS.] In making determinations as to access, the commissioner may consider: (1) the extent to which the utilization of needed health care services or products by the intended targeted population is likely to increase or decrease. When a proposed arrangement is likely to increase access in one geographic area, by lowering prices or otherwise expanding supply, but limits access in another geographic area by removing service capabilities from that second area, the commissioner shall articulate the criteria employed to balance these effects; (2) the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to make available a new and needed service or product to a certain geographic area; and (3) the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to otherwise make health care services or products more financially or geographically available to persons who need them. If the commissioner determines that the proposed arrangement is likely to increase access and bases that determination on a projected increase in utilization, the commissioner shall also determine and make a specific finding that the increased utilization does not reflect overutilization. (d) [QUALITY.] In making determinations as to quality, the commissioner may consider the extent to which the proposed arrangement is likely to: (1) decrease morbidity and mortality; (2) result in faster convalescence; (3) result in fewer hospital days; (4) permit providers to attain needed experience or frequency of treatment, likely to lead to better outcomes; (5) increase patient satisfaction; and (6) have any other features likely to improve or reduce the quality of health care. Sec. 28. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 62J.2921, subdivision 2, is amended to read: Subd. 2. [NOTICE.] The commissioner shall begin a proceeding to revoke approval by providing written notice to the applicant describing in detail the basis for the proposed revocation. Notice of the proceeding must be published in the State Register and submitted to the Minnesota health care commission andthe applicable regional coordinating boards. The notice must invite the submission of comments to the commissioner. Sec. 29. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 62J.451, subdivision 6b, is amended to read: Subd. 6b.

(4) Administer and supervise all noninstitutional service to handicapped persons, including those who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, or physically impaired or otherwise handicapped. The commissioner may provide and contract for the care and treatment of qualified indigent children in facilities other than those located and available at state hospitals when it is not feasible to provide the service in state hospitals. (5) Assist and actively cooperate with other departments, agencies and institutions, local, state, and federal, by performing services in conformity with the purposes of Laws 1939, chapter 431. (6) Act as the agent of and cooperate with the federal government in matters of mutual concern relative to and in conformity with the provisions of Laws 1939, chapter 431, including the administration of any federal funds granted to the state to aid in the performance of any functions of the commissioner as specified in Laws 1939, chapter 431, and including the promulgation of rules making uniformly available medical care benefits to all recipients of public assistance, at such times as the federal government increases its participation in assistance expenditures for medical care to recipients of public assistance, the cost thereof to be borne in the same proportion as are grants of aid to said recipients. (7) Establish and maintain any administrative units reasonably necessary for the performance of administrative functions common to all divisions of the department. (8) Act as designated guardian of both the estate and the person of all the wards of the state of Minnesota, whether by operation of law or by an order of court, without any further act or proceeding whatever, except as to persons committed as mentally retarded. (9) Act as coordinating referral and informational center on requests for service for newly arrived immigrants coming to Minnesota. (10) The specific enumeration of powers and duties as hereinabove set forth shall in no way be construed to be a limitation upon the general transfer of powers herein contained. (11) Establish county, regional, or statewide schedules of maximum fees and charges which may be paid by county agencies for medical, dental, surgical, hospital, nursing and nursing home care and medicine and medical supplies under all programs of medical care provided by the state and for congregate living care under the income maintenance programs. (12) Have the authority to conduct and administer experimental projects to test methods and procedures of administering assistance and services to recipients or potential recipients of public welfare. To carry out such experimental projects, it is further provided that the commissioner of human services is authorized to waive the enforcement of existing specific statutory program requirements, rules, and standards in one or more counties. The order establishing the waiver shall provide alternative methods and procedures of administration, shall not be in conflict with the basic purposes, coverage, or benefits provided by law, and in no event shall the duration of a project exceed four years. It is further provided that no order establishing an experimental project as authorized by the provisions of this section shall become effective until the following conditions have been met: (a) The proposed comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs and the proposed order establishing the waiver, shall be filed with the secretary of the senate and chief clerk of the house of representatives at least 60 days prior to its effective date. (b) The secretary of health, education, and welfare of the United States has agreed, for the same project, to waive state plan requirements relative to statewide uniformity. (c) A comprehensive plan, including estimated project costs, shall be approved by the legislative advisory commission and filed with the commissioner of administration. (13) In accordance with federal requirements, establish procedures to be followed by local welfare boards in creating citizen advisory committees, including procedures for selection of committee members. (14) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions which are based on quality control error rates for the aid to families with dependent children, medical assistance, or food stamp program in the following manner: (a) One-half of the total amount of the disallowance shall be borne by the county boards responsible for administering the programs. For the medical assistance and AFDC programs, disallowances shall be shared by each county board in the same proportion as that county's expenditures for the sanctioned program are to the total of all counties' expenditures for the AFDC and medical assistance programs. For the food stamp program, sanctions shall be shared by each county board, with 50 percent of the sanction being distributed to each county in the same proportion as that county's administrative costs for food stamps are to the total of all food stamp administrative costs for all counties, and 50 percent of the sanctions being distributed to each county in the same proportion as that county's value of food stamp benefits issued are to the total of all benefits issued for all counties. Each county shall pay its share of the disallowance to the state of Minnesota. When a county fails to pay the amount due hereunder, the commissioner may deduct the amount from reimbursement otherwise due the county, or the attorney general, upon the request of the commissioner, may institute civil action to recover the amount due. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a), if the disallowance results from knowing noncompliance by one or more counties with a specific program instruction, and that knowing noncompliance is a matter of official county board record, the commissioner may require payment or recover from the county or counties, in the manner prescribed in paragraph (a), an amount equal to the portion of the total disallowance which resulted from the noncompliance, and may distribute the balance of the disallowance according to paragraph (a). (15) Develop and implement special projects that maximize reimbursements and result in the recovery of money to the state. For the purpose of recovering state money, the commissioner may enter into contracts with third parties. Any recoveries that result from projects or contracts entered into under this paragraph shall be deposited in the state treasury and credited to a special account until the balance in the account reaches $1,000,000. When the balance in the account exceeds $1,000,000, the excess shall be transferred and credited to the general fund. All money in the account is appropriated to the commissioner for the purposes of this paragraph. (16) Have the authority to make direct payments to facilities providing shelter to women and their children pursuant to section 256D.05, subdivision 3. Upon the written request of a shelter facility that has been denied payments under section 256D.05, subdivision 3, the commissioner shall review all relevant evidence and make a determination within 30 days of the request for review regarding issuance of direct payments to the shelter facility. Failure to act within 30 days shall be considered a determination not to issue direct payments. (17) Have the authority to establish and enforce the following county reporting requirements: (a) The commissioner shall establish fiscal and statistical reporting requirements necessary to account for the expenditure of funds allocated to counties for human services programs. When establishing financial and statistical reporting requirements, the commissioner shall evaluate all reports, in consultation with the counties, to determine if the reports can be simplified or the number of reports can be reduced. (b) The county board shall submit monthly or quarterly reports to the department as required by the commissioner. Monthly reports are due no later than 15 working days after the end of the month. Quarterly reports are due no later than 30 calendar days after the end of the quarter, unless the commissioner determines that the deadline must be shortened to 20 calendar days to avoid jeopardizing compliance with federal deadlines or risking a loss of federal funding. Only reports that are complete, legible, and in the required format shall be accepted by the commissioner. (c) If the required reports are not received by the deadlines established in clause (b), the commissioner may delay payments and withhold funds from the county board until the next reporting period. When the report is needed to account for the use of federal funds and the late report results in a reduction in federal funding, the commissioner shall withhold from the county boards with late reports an amount equal to the reduction in federal funding until full federal funding is received. (d) A county board that submits reports that are late, illegible, incomplete, or not in the required format for two out of three consecutive reporting periods is considered noncompliant. When a county board is found to be noncompliant, the commissioner shall notify the county board of the reason the county board is considered noncompliant and request that the county board develop a corrective action plan stating how the county board plans to correct the problem. The corrective action plan must be submitted to the commissioner within 45 days after the date the county board received notice of noncompliance. (e) The final deadline for fiscal reports or amendments to fiscal reports is one year after the date the report was originally due. If the commissioner does not receive a report by the final deadline, the county board forfeits the funding associated with the report for that reporting period and the county board must repay any funds associated with the report received for that reporting period. (f) The commissioner may not delay payments, withhold funds, or require repayment under paragraph (c) or (e) if the county demonstrates that the commissioner failed to provide appropriate forms, guidelines, and technical assistance to enable the county to comply with the requirements. If the county board disagrees with an action taken by the commissioner under paragraph (c) or (e), the county board may appeal the action according to sections 14.57 to 14.69. (g) Counties subject to withholding of funds under paragraph (c) or forfeiture or repayment of funds under paragraph (e) shall not reduce or withhold benefits or services to clients to cover costs incurred due to actions taken by the commissioner under paragraph (c) or (e). (18) Allocate federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions for audit exceptions when federal fiscal disallowances or sanctions are based on a statewide random sample for the foster care program under title IV-E of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, in direct proportion to each county's title IV-E foster care maintenance claim for that period. (19) Have the authority to administer a drug rebate program for drugs purchased pursuant to the senior citizen drug program established under section 256.955 after the beneficiary's satisfaction of any deductible established in the program. The commissioner shall require a rebate agreement from all manufacturers of covered drugs as defined in section 256B.0625, subdivision 13. For each drug, the amount of the rebate shall be equal to the basic rebate as defined for purposes of the federal rebate program in United States Code, title 42, section 1396r-8(c)(1). This basic rebate shall be applied to single-source and multiple-source drugs. The manufacturers must provide full payment within 30 days of receipt of the state invoice for the rebate within the terms and conditions used for the federal rebate program established pursuant to section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act. The manufacturers must provide the commissioner with any information necessary to verify the rebate determined per drug. The rebate program shall utilize the terms and conditions used for the federal rebate program established pursuant to section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act. Sec. 2. [256.955] [SENIOR CITIZEN DRUG PROGRAM.] Subdivision 1. [ESTABLISHMENT.] The commissioner of human services shall establish and administer a senior citizen drug program.

Subd. 4. [APPLICATION PROCEDURES AND COORDINATION WITH MEDICAL ASSISTANCE.] Applications and information on the program must be made available at county social service agencies, health care provider offices, and agencies and organizations serving senior citizens. Senior citizens shall submit applications and any information specified by the commissioner as being necessary to verify eligibility directly to the county social service agencies: (1) beginning January 1, 1999, the county social service agency shall determine medical assistance spenddown eligibility of individuals who qualify for the senior citizen drug program of individuals; and (2) program payments will be used to reduce the spenddown obligations of individuals who are determined to be eligible for medical assistance with a spenddown as defined in section 256B.056, subdivision 5. Seniors who are eligible for medical assistance with a spenddown shall be financially responsible for the deductible amount up to the satisfaction of the spenddown. No deductible applies once the spenddown has been met. Payments to providers for prescription drugs for persons eligible under this subdivision shall be reduced by the deductible. County social service agencies shall determine an applicant's eligibility for the program within 30 days from the date the application is received. Subd. 5.

Subd. 9. [PROGRAM LIMITATION.] This section shall be repealed upon federal approval of the waiver to allow the commissioner to provide prescription drug coverage for qualified Medicare beneficiaries whose income is less than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. Sec. 3. Minnesota Statutes 1996, section 256B.0625, subdivision 13, is amended to read: Subd. 13. [DRUGS.] (a) Medical assistance covers drugs, except for fertility drugs when specifically used to enhance fertility, if prescribed by a licensed practitioner and dispensed by a licensed pharmacist, by a physician enrolled in the medical assistance program as a dispensing physician, or by a physician or a nurse practitioner employed by or under contract with a community health board as defined in section 145A.02, subdivision 5, for the purposes of communicable disease control. The commissioner, after receiving recommendations from professional medical associations and professional pharmacist associations, shall designate a formulary committee to advise the commissioner on the names of drugs for which payment is made, recommend a system for reimbursing providers on a set fee or charge basis rather than the present system, and develop methods encouraging use of generic drugs when they are less expensive and equally effective as trademark drugs. The formulary committee shall consist of nine members, four of whom shall be physicians who are not employed by the department of human services, and a majority of whose practice is for persons paying privately or through health insurance, three of whom shall be pharmacists who are not employed by the department of human services, and a majority of whose practice is for persons paying privately or through health insurance, a consumer representative, and a nursing home representative. Committee members shall serve three-year terms and shall serve without compensation. Members may be reappointed once. (b) The commissioner shall establish a drug formulary. Its establishment and publication shall not be subject to the requirements of the administrative procedure act, but the formulary committee shall review and comment on the formulary contents. The formulary committee shall review and recommend drugs which require prior authorization. The formulary committee may recommend drugs for prior authorization directly to the commissioner, as long as opportunity for public input is provided. Prior authorization may be requested by the commissioner based on medical and clinical criteria before certain drugs are eligible for payment. Before a drug may be considered for prior authorization at the request of the commissioner: (1) the drug formulary committee must develop criteria to be used for identifying drugs; the development of these criteria is not subject to the requirements of chapter 14, but the formulary committee shall provide opportunity for public input in developing criteria; (2) the drug formulary committee must hold a public forum and receive public comment for an additional 15 days; and (3) the commissioner must provide information to the formulary committee on the impact that placing the drug on prior authorization will have on the quality of patient care and information regarding whether the drug is subject to clinical abuse or misuse. Prior authorization may be required by the commissioner before certain formulary drugs are eligible for payment. The formulary shall not include: (i) drugs or products for which there is no federal funding; (ii) over-the-counter drugs, except for antacids, acetaminophen, family planning products, aspirin, insulin, products for the treatment of lice, vitamins for adults with documented vitamin deficiencies, and vitamins for children under the age of seven and pregnant or nursing women; (iii) any other over-the-counter drug identified by the commissioner, in consultation with the drug formulary committee, as necessary, appropriate, and cost-effective for the treatment of certain specified chronic diseases, conditions or disorders, and this determination shall not be subject to the requirements of chapter 14; (iv) anorectics; and(v) drugs for which medical value has not been established; and (vi) drugs from manufacturers who have not signed a rebate agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to section 1927 of title XIX of the Social Security Act and who have not signed an agreement with the state for drugs purchased pursuant to the senior citizen drug program established under section 256.955. The commissioner shall publish conditions for prohibiting payment for specific drugs after considering the formulary committee's recommendations. (c) The basis for determining the amount of payment shall be the lower of the actual acquisition costs of the drugs plus a fixed dispensing fee; the maximum allowable cost set by the federal government or by the commissioner plus the fixed dispensing fee; or the usual and customary price charged to the public. The pharmacy dispensing fee shall be $3.85. Actual acquisition cost includes quantity and other special discounts except time and cash discounts. The actual acquisition cost of a drug shall be estimated by the commissioner, at average wholesale price minus nine percent. The maximum allowable cost of a multisource drug may be set by the commissioner and it shall be comparable to, but no higher than, the maximum amount paid by other third-party payors in this state who have maximum allowable cost programs. Establishment of the amount of payment for drugs shall not be subject to the requirements of the administrative procedure act. An additional dispensing fee of $.30 may be added to the dispensing fee paid to pharmacists for legend drug prescriptions dispensed to residents of long-term care facilities when a unit dose blister card system, approved by the department, is used. Under this type of dispensing system, the pharmacist must dispense a 30-day supply of drug. The National Drug Code (NDC) from the drug container used to fill the blister card must be identified on the claim to the department. The unit dose blister card containing the drug must meet the packaging standards set forth in Minnesota Rules, part 6800.2700, that govern the return of unused drugs to the pharmacy for reuse. The pharmacy provider will be required to credit the department for the actual acquisition cost of all unused drugs that are eligible for reuse. Over-the-counter medications must be dispensed in the manufacturer's unopened package. The commissioner may permit the drug clozapine to be dispensed in a quantity that is less than a 30-day supply. Whenever a generically equivalent product is available, payment shall be on the basis of the actual acquisition cost of the generic drug, unless the prescriber specifically indicates \"dispense as written - brand necessary\" on the prescription as required by section 151.21, subdivision 2. Sec. 4. [SENIOR DRUG PROGRAM.] The commissioner shall administer the senior drug program so that the costs to the state total no more than $4,000,000 plus the amount of the rebate. The commissioner is authorized to discontinue enrollment in order to meet this level of funding. The commissioner shall report to the legislature the estimated costs of the senior drug program without funding caps. The report shall be included as part of the November and February forecasts. The commissioner of finance shall annually reimburse the general fund with health care access funds for the estimated increased costs in the QMB/SLMB program directly associated with the senior drug program. This reimbursement shall sunset June 30, 2001. Sec. 5. [STUDY ON DUAL PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE.] The commissioner of human services shall study the implications to the senior citizen drug program if a health plan company offers within the state a product that provides a prescription drug benefit as part of the standard coverage for Medicare enrollees and shall make recommendations on how to address this issue to the legislature by January 15, 1998.

Sec. 7. [62T.07] [CRITERIA FOR GRANTING WAIVERS.] The commissioner may approve a request for waiver under section 62T.06 if the applicant demonstrates that the contracting arrangement between a health care purchasing alliance and an accountable provider network will meet the following criteria: (a) The arrangement would be likely to result in: (1) more choice in benefits and prices; (2) lower costs; (3) increased access to health care coverage by small businesses; (4) increased access to providers who have demonstrated a long-term commitment to the community being serviced; or (5) increased quality of health care than would otherwise occur under the existing market conditions. In the event that a proposed arrangement appears likely to improve one or two of the criteria at the expense of another one or two of the criteria, the commissioner shall not approve the waiver. (b) The proposed alternative methods would provide equal or improved results in consumer protection than would result under the existing consumer protections requirements. Sec. 8. [62T.08] [SUPERVISION AND REVOCATION OF WAIVERS.] (a) The commissioner shall appropriately supervise and monitor approved waivers.
