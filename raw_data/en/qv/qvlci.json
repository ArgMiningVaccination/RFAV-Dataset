Here are the FACTS : Vaccines are very safe. A child is far more likely to be i njured by one of these diseases than by any vaccine. M ost children will have no reaction to vaccines.

Vaccination is the safer choice. W hen children get sick \"naturally\" they can pass on t he disease to others who may be harmed.

Here are the FACTS : Our children are exposed to many diseases that could do them harm. Vaccines are the best way to protect against those diseases. Scientific data show that vaccination with multiple vaccines at the same time has no harmful effects on the normal childhood immune system. Children sometimes need additional shots (booster doses) of a vaccine to make sure they are still protected from the disease. Resources http://www.aap.org/immunization/index.html MYTH #8 : Healthcare providers give vaccines regardless of the child's health. Here are the FACTS : A healthcare provider checks whether a child is healthy enough to receive a vaccination. There are times when a vaccination may not be given to a child. This can include times when they are ill with a fever or other health problems. Parents are provided with Vaccine Information Statements to better understand the vaccination's purpose and the potential risks and side effects. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/vis/default.htm www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/ACIP-list.htm MYTH #9 : There is NO scientific proof that immunization prevents disease. Here are the FACTS : Scientific studies have shown that vaccines prevent many infectious diseases that were once common in this country, including polio, measles, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), rubella (German measles), mumps, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib). Vaccines have decreased deaths and hospitalizations by at least 90 percent. In the case of smallpox, diphtheria, and polio vaccines, deaths and hospitalizations related to these diseases have declined by 100 percent. In areas of the world where these vaccines are not available, vaccine preventable diseases still sicken and kill many people. Resources www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm MYTH #10 : Polio would have gone away without vaccines. Here are the FACTS : Before polio vaccine was available, as many as 20,000 new cases were reported each year. Polio has been eliminated in the United States but continues to be present in other countries with lower vaccination rates. Stopping vaccination before polio is eliminated world-wide would result in a return of polio in the United States. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/whatifstop.htm MYTH #11 : Vaccines contain thimerosal which causes autism. Here are the FACTS : No valid studies have ever shown that thimerosal causes autism. To address public concerns, thimerosal has been removed from most childhood vaccines. Since 1999, the use of thimerosal in vaccines has greatly declined. However, the rates of autism since 1999 have only increased. Numerous scientific studies have been conducted that show no link between autism and thimerosal. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/concerns/thimerosal/index.html http://www.aap.org/immunization/families/faq/VaccineStudies.pdf MYTH #12 : My child does not need the HPV vaccine because s/he is not having sex. Here are the FACTS : For best protection, children should get the vaccine between the ages of 11 and 12 years of age before they are sexually active and have been exposed to HPV. HPV is extremely common and can lead to cervical cancer and genital warts. The HPV vaccine does not cure an HPV infection if someone has already been infected with HPV. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/ MYTH #13 : Vaccines don't work. Here are the FACTS : Years of careful study have shown that vaccines, while not always 100% effective for everyone, are our best protection against disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Being vaccinated not only protects the child but also protects the community. People who are unable to be vaccinated themselves will be less likely to be exposed to disease if those around them are vaccinated. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/howvpd.htm MYTH #14 : Booster shots prove that vaccines don't really work. Here are the FACTS : One dose of a vaccine may not be enough to provide full protection against a disease forever. Overtime, some vaccines lose their ability to protect you against disease. Booster shots may be needed periodically to \"boost\" the immune system so that you will continue to be protected against disease. Resources www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm MYTH #15 : Vaccines cause Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). Here are the FACTS : Studies have shown that vaccines are not a risk factor for SIDS. Most SIDS deaths are caused by other factors such as newborns sleeping on their stomachs, sharing a bed, exposure to cigarette smoke, and mild respiratory infections. There have been fewer deaths from SIDS since the American Academy of Pediatric's recommendation to place healthy babies on their backs to sleep even though vaccination rates have remained the same. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/sids MYTH #16 : Vaccines are full of unnecessary and harmful chemicals. Here are the FACTS : Preservatives stop vaccines from becoming contaminated by germs. Adjuvants are substances added to a vaccine to strengthen your body's immune response to the vaccine. Additives are substances added in small amounts to stop vaccine from breaking down and sticking to the sides of the vial. These chemicals added to the vaccine have been tested for safety and contribute to the effectiveness of the vaccine. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/ http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vac-gen/additives.htmMYTH #17 : The live virus in the measles and mumps vaccine (MMR) causes brain swelling. Here are the FACTS : No. All well done studies on this issue have found no connection between the MMR vaccine and brain swelling. The CDC, which tracks possible bad reactions to vaccines, reports that brain swelling rarely happens after receiving the MMR vaccine. Unvaccinated children infected with the measles virus run the risk of severe brain swelling which can result in brain damage. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/vaers.html http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/ MYTH #18 : Vaccines are harmful to my child. Here are the FACTS : Vaccines go through careful safety studies before they are actually used. This process can take 10 years or longer. Vaccines must be proven to be safe and effective in children. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) monitors and investigates any harmful reactions from vaccine. Any problems identified result in additional investigation. Serious side effects from vaccines are very rare, while serious side effects from the diseases they protect against are far more common. Resources http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Activities/vaers.html http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Vaccine_Monitoring/Index.html http://www.vaccinesafety.edu/ MYTH #19 : Vaccinations have caused the increase in autism. Here are the FACTS : To date, there is no definite, scientific proof that any vaccine or combination of vaccines can cause autism. The well known study that linked autism and vaccination has since been proven to be a fraud. Just because the symptoms of autism begin to occur around the same time as the child's vaccinations does not mean that one caused the other.

Here are the FACTS : Hepatitis B is a real and serious risk for infants and young children that can go undetected. The younger you are when you get Hepatitis B, the greater the chance you will develop liver damage and cancer later in life. Newborns can get Hepatitis B from their mother during childbirth or contact with contaminated blood and bodily fluids. Hepatitis B vaccine is a safe way to protect against this dangerous disease. "}
