Well I was totally surprised after only about 4 days the skin on my face had a more even tone...it actually glowed...I was stunned...I've made up my own facial moisturizer with oils for years and never have I seen such an instant effect. I love these and also the smell is beautiful. Thankyou for being truthful about how amazing these are in your advertising!\" Almost 60 and these products have been Life Changing! \"I was exposed to a lot of sun as a young adult, born in Florida... My skin is extremely sensitive so I have to be cautious... I came across Ayurveda products and I thought maybe oils would help the dryness and skin damage. This is with out a doubt the best product I have ever used. iYURA Oils and they are incredible. I wake up with soft smooth skin. This line of products is excellent everything I have tried has amazing results. For all those who are skeptical about oils, Please give these products a try especially those with sensitive skin!\" \"I truly LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! this Ajara Sandalwood Rose Age Defying Eye Butter. I started noticing a difference within two weeks my dark circles under my eye are starting to get much lighter, I never thought that I would go out of the house WITHOUT makeup on I can now\" Amazing products with great results \"Love these products. After the first 5 days I did notice my fingertips much softer, then I saw the softness in my face. After 3 weeks of using these products I have noticed my age spots becoming lighter and less noticeable. With that being said I am now using both products on my chest and the back of my hands. I will be ordering again, referring to family & friends and enjoying the results. Love to finally find products that actually do what they say.\" ...more than EXCELLENT!! \"The Neroli Orange Nutritive Serum (For Dry/Vata Skin) is by far a product I will continue to order over and over again -- if not just for the olfactory dance with Neroli, but also the premium quality of this gorgeous serum. I admit to looking forward daily to the deep breath I take when I apply this nutritive serum. I admit to being a picky consumer and if the product or even the packaging does not meet my high standards I disregard the item and move on. This serum is by far the finest quality, vibration, and nutritive product I have yet to try in my 65 years of life.\" Smells like heaven and works perfectly \"The Yauvari Amplified Youth Serum works as promised. People tell me I'm glowing and ask me what makeup I'm wearing, even though I haven't used foundation makeup for years. The bonus? It smells like grown up Fruit Loops, and I can't get enough of the natural scent.\" Get A Free 15-Minute *For USA Phone Numbers Only* Come, visit our Store at Del Amo Fashion Center, Main Level, Torrance, CA Del Amo Fashion Center, Main Level, 3525 W Carson St, Torrance, CA 90503 Opening hours: 10 AM to 9 PM, daily Glendale Galleria Mall, 100W Broadway STE 1121, Glendale CA 91210 Opening hours: 10 AM to 7 PM, daily Authentic Ayurveda in a NEVER-seen "}
