We summar ised evidence from three previous reviews (to June 2014) and conducted a n updated search of nine databases and grey literature (2011 -19) (registration : CRD42017065933) for prospective studies of interventions aimed to alleviate symptoms , improve Qol or functional exercise capacity in fibrotic ILD . Data were synthesised through narrative synthesis or meta -analys ed as appropriate. Forty -seven studies with 2,527 participants were included. From 22 pharmacological studies of el even differ ent interventions (n=1 ,683) the most tested interventions were bosentan and sildenafil . From 25 non-pharmacological studies, t he most tested intervention was for pulmonary rehabilitatio n / exercise training (PR) (22 studies , n=748). An improvement in 6- minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) immediately following PR 39.9 m [18.2 to 61.5]) but not longer -term (3 or 6 months , 4 studies; n=147, MD 5. 3 m [-12.9 to 23.4]. Multiple, varied outcome measures were used, e.g. 37 studies assess ing dyspnoea used 10 different scales with lack of reporting of rate of deterioration in outcomes. Evidence gap mapping highlighted the most and least researched symptom s were dyspnoea and cough respectively. This evidence synthesis highlights overwhelmingly that the most researched symptom is dyspnoea and the strongest evidence base is for short -term PR. The least researched symptom was cough. Research going forward must focus on prioritising and standardising meaningful outcomes and focusing interventions on neglected symptoms. Social media take home message: Cough is a neglected symptom in ILD . Future research must prioritise and standardise mean ingful outcomes and focus interventions on neglected symptoms whilst ensuring dyspnoea is prioritised as a primary end point for future studies. Introduction Rationale Patients with Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) can live for many years , with some ILDs responsive to treatment. However, fibrotic ILDs (such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)) have a shorter disease trajectory which can be rapidly advancing. [1] The resulting physical and psychological burden with impact on quality of life (Qol) , can be substantial for both patients and carers. [2] A recent pivotal ILD position statement stressed the need to deliver early and effective palliative care and the importance of \" living as well as possible\" as disease advances .[3] Essential to achieving this is to improve symptom management and Qol as well as improving functional exercise capacity . Previous systematic reviews have summarised interventions to improve symptoms and Qol in ILD, [4, 5] [6] (see online Suppl1 for further details). As the importance of improving the symptoms, functional exercise capacity and Qol of these patients has become increasingly recognised [7, 8] , there has been a surge in intervention studies. There is therefore a need to synthesis e previous research with more recently published studies and highlight areas in which we may move research forward in a meaningful way. Objectives We aim to synthesise relevant studies from three previous systematic reviews with more recently published studie s and highlight gaps in research through an evidence gap map. Methods Protocol and registration The systematic review was carried out in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta -Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and the protocol is registered on the PROSPERO database ( CRD42017065933 ). The protocol stated that participants with a confirmed diagnosis of ILD would be included. However, after reflection within the Project Advisory Team, to limit heterogeneity, it was decided to focus on fibrotic ILDs only as the y all shared the commonality of shorter disease trajectory , severi ty of symptoms and poor functional exercise capacity . Eligibility criteria We included studies recruiting participants with a confirmed clinical or pathological/ radiological dia gnosis of a fibrotic ILD (including, but not restricted to IPF and non-specific interstitial pneumonia ). We excluded studies in people with connective tissue ILDs or obstructive sleep apnoea and those for which the breakdown of ILD diagnoses was not available. Eligible interventions were any pharmacological or non -pharmacological intervention aimed at managing symptoms or improving Qol (such as oxygen therapy, opioids, corticosteroids and non -invasive ventilation) or functional exercise capacity (as measured by 6MWD) . Radical disease modifying interventions , that were evaluated in studies primarily focused on improving survival and lung function, were deemed out of scope. We accepted any comparators/controls. Eligible outcomes were all symptom control outcomes ( such as breathlessness, cough and fatigue), Qol outcomes and 6MWD . Prospective efficacy and effectiveness studies of any design were eligible including observational (e.g. cohort studies) and interventional prospective studies (e.g. randomised controlled studies, controlled clinical trials, before and after studies) . Information sources : Two authors (AO & SB) independently screened studies that were included in the previous reviews [4, 5] [6] for inclusion . In addition, n ine electronic databases were searched for journal articles, meeting abstracts, ongoing studies and reviews from 2011 to January 2019 with no language restrictions : Ovid MEDLINE , Ovid EMBASE , Web databases , Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) , UK Clinical Trials Gateway and PROSPERO . Reference lists of included studies were screened and expert s in the field contacted to identify additional studies. Searches of grey literature , conference proceedings and research in progress databases were also conducted. Search A combination of MESH headings and keywords were used . For example in Medline, the following terms were combined: Lung Diseases, Interstitial/dt, pc, rh, su [Drug Therapy, Prevention & Control, Rehabilitation, Surgery] OR Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/dt, pc, rh, su Idiopathic Pneumonias/dt, OR interstitial lung letter or editorial).pt. The searche s were then limited to 2011 to current year. The full search strategy can be found in online Suppl1 . Study selection and data collection process Studies w ere selected for inclusion in a two -stage process using predefined criteria. The full literature search results were screened independently by at least two reviewers (JC, EL, AO & SB) in order to identify all citations that may potentially meet the inclusi on criteria, following which the full manuscripts of all selected citations were retrieved and assessed, again by two reviewers, against the inclusion criteria. Studies published as abstracts or conference presentations w ere only included if sufficient det ails to allow an appraisal of the methodology and an assessment of the results to be undertaken could be obtained . Study authors were contacted for missing information and authors of the abstracts published after 2015 were contacted if there w ere insuffici ent details to allow its inclusion in the review . Where authors did not respond, only abstracts with enough details of study participants, intervention and results were included . Where studies included a proportion of ineligible lung diseases , or where diagnoses were unclear, we contacted the authors for further information and only included these studies if this information became available. A list of potentially relevant but excluded studies is provided in online Suppl2 . An inclusion flow c hart and data extraction sheet were developed and used for each paper assessed . All data extraction was conducted independently by at least two reviewers. Disagreements were resolved by consensus or, if necessary, through arbitration by a third reviewer. Data items Data extracted included authors, intervention, comparator, diagnostic criteria, study design, quality rating and summary of results. Risk of bias in individual studies In assessing study quality, we used the Cochrane risk of bias tool [9] for RCTs and c ontrolled clinical trials (CCT) , with the risk of selection bias used to establish the overall risk of bias for each study. We used tools developed by the National Institute for Health, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NIH NHLBI) to assess the qua lity of other prospective studies , including cohort studies [10]. Summary measures , synthesis of results and analysis Studies w ere synthesised through a narrative synthesis , with tabulation of the results of included studies. Data were combined using Review Manager ( RevMan, Version 5.3). [11] Studies were exami ned for clinical, methodological and statistical heterogeneity . Only if sufficient homogeneity exist ed, meta -analysis was considered appropriate. If data permit ted meta -analysis, we assess ed statistical heterogeneity of the pooled effect size using the I - squared statistic, the chi -square test for heterogeneity, and through a visual inspection of forest plots. Possible reasons for heterogeneity w ere explored, and fixed effects and random effects meta -analyses w ere undertaken as appropriate . The choice of model was determined by the degree of heterogeneity, as judged by the I2 statistic and p value for the chi -squared test (a random effects model was used if P<0.10 and/or I2 >50%). Dichotomous outcome data were expressed as odds ratios or risk r atios. Continuous outcome data were expressed as mean differences or standardised mean differences as appropriate. For continuous variables, we consider ed presenting the results for end -point data or for the change from baseline. All meta -analyses w ere presented in forest plots, with point estimates and measures of variance (95% confidence intervals). Results Study selection The updated search es identified 18,133 publications after removal of duplicates . Titles/abstracts of th ese publications were screened for eligibility resulting in exclusion of 17,902 . 231 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility . Of these , 58 records (3 0 studies) were included in data synthesis . The reasons for exclusions of the remaining 173 articles are detailed in Figure 1. 18 records ( 17 studies ) were included from the previous reviews. In total, we included 47 primary studies reported in 76 articles (Figure 1). Study characteristics and risk of bias A detailed summary of study characteristics is included in online Suppl3 . 22 (46.8%) studies were RCTs, three (6.4%) were CCTs, 20 (42.3%) were before and after studies and two (4.3%) were cohort studies. The included studies analysed 2,510 participants in total, 2 7% to 85% were males, and mean ages from 54 -86 years. 33 studies included only people with IPF [12-44]. Of the remaining studies, 23 % to 85% had IPF and 7% to 46% NSIP (where reported). The mean percentage predicted FVC ranged from 49.8% -103.6%, and the 6MWD from 71 to 906 metres. 22 (46.8%) studies assessed 11 different pharmacological interventions [12-18, 20 -25, 39, 42, 43, 45 -50]. 25 (53.2%) studies assessed non-pharmacological interventions. Pulmonary Rehabilitation or exercise training (PR) was evaluated in 22 studies [27-32, 34 -37, 40, 41, 44, 51-59], while three studies used other non-pharmacological interventions [2, 26, 38] . Among 22 studies that assessed pharmacological interventions, the comparator was placebo in 10 (45.5%) studies [13, 14, 21 -23, 39, 42, 45, 48, 49] , while in three (13.6%) studies the comparator was another treatment [17, 25, 43] . In six (27.3%) studies, there was no cont rol group [12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 46] , while one (4.5%) study had a health y control group [16]. One study that assessed pharmacological interventions had room air as the control [47], while another study had \"no oxygen\" as control [50]. Three studies compared non -pharmacological complex interventions with usual care [2, 26, 38]. Among 22 studies that assessed pulmonary rehabilitation or exercise training (PR), one study compared PR in participants with IPF to PR in those with other ILD diagnoses [54], while another study compared P R in participants with IPF to those with sarcoidosis [31]. One study compared PR in participants with IPF to PR in those with COPD from a previous study [58]. Eleven (50%) PR studies had no control group. Three (13.6%) studies compared PR with usual care [28, 32, 35] , one study compared PR with a control group that did not involve PR or addition of new medicine [27], one study compared PR with a control group that did not involve any PR , [59] and one study compared PR with a control group that only involved regular medical treatment alone [34]. Two (9.1%) studies compared PR with another intervention [40, 41] . 25 (53.2%) studies did not specify their primary outcome ; 12 (25.5%) studies used 6MWD as their primary outcome [13, 22 -24, 28, 32, 34, 41, 48, 52, 53, 59] ; four (8.5%) studies measured cough as their primary outcome [21, 39, 42, 49] ; one (2.1%) study measured Qol as their primary outcome [50] and one (2.1%) study had both Qol and 6MWD as primary outcomes [29]; four (8.5%) studies used other primary outcomes besides cough, Qol and 6MWD [2, 14, 45, 46] . None of the studies examined dyspnoea as their primary o utcome. Table 1 presents study characteristics (study size, PICOS and follow -up duration ) with both a summary of risk of bias and outcomes. Online Suppl 3 describes detailed PICOS characteristics of included studies , Suppl4 provides detailed baseline characteristics of included participants while Suppl 5 presents a more detailed account of their quality assessment.

IPF defined by consensus criteria; advanced stage defined as a diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of < 35% of the predict ed value.2IPF considered the most likely diagnosis by the regional ILD MDT; cough; radiological features a restrictive ventilatory defect (VC) <90% predicted and/or transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLco) <90% predicted). In assessing study quality, we used the Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for RCTs and controlled clinical trials, with the risk of selection bias (i.e random sequence generation and allocation concealment) used to establish the overall risk of bias for each study. Where both random sequence generation and allocation conceal ment were rated low, the study was given a 'low' RoB; where either random sequence generation or allocation concealment was rated unclear, the study was given an unclear RoB; where both random sequence generation and allocation concealment were rated high, the study was given a 'high' RoB. Other p rospective studies were rated as 'good', 'fair', or 'poor' quality depending on the number of items rated positively. For before and after studies, where three items or less were rated positiv ely, a rating of 'poor' was given; where four to seven items were rated positively, a rating of 'fair' was given; where eight items or more we re rated positively, a rating of 'good' was given. For cross sectional studies, where six items or less were rated positively, a ra ting of 'poor' was given.

Pharmacological intervention s. Intervention, compared to, with f/u Bosentan Bosentan was assessed in three RCTs (reported in 5 papers [13, 14, 45, 60 , 61] ) and 8 08 participants : BUILD 1 [13, 61] showed no benefit of bosentan orally twice daily (62.5mg up titrated to 125mg twice daily after 1 month ) compared with placebo for 6MWD or dyspnoea in 154 participants followed up to 12 months . These findings were supported by a second larger RCT (BUILD 3) with 61 6 participants .[14] BUILD 1 [13] found no difference for any domain of the SGRQ at 12 months, 42% of bosentan treated participants had an improved SF-36 health transition score compared with 28% of placebo (p=0.084). Sub group analysis of participants who had undergone diagnostic biopsy however favoured bosentan showing a significant beneficial effect on Qol with mean total SGRQ scores favouring bosentan. [61] Significant treatment effects were observed at 12 months in the impact domain of the SGRQ (median treatment effect (MTE) -7.0 p=0.03), physical functioning p=0.01) and role emoti domains of the SF -36 (MTE 0.0 p=0.04). [13] However, none of these findings were supported in the larger BUILD 3 study. [14] A third RCT repo rted in two papers [45, 60] in 39 pa rticipants receiving similar doses of bosentan or placebo for 16 weeks , found no statistically significant difference in 6MWD or Qol. Sildenafil In the review by Bajwah et al [4], sildenafil was assessed in four studies (1 before and after study [24] and two RCTs [22, 23] , of which one of the RCTs [22] was followed by an open label study) and 378 participants : the before -and after study [24] found a significant mean (90% CI) improvement in 6MWD of 49.0m ( 95% CI 17.5 to 84.0) in 11 participants (receiving between 20 and 50mg sildenafil three times daily for 12 weeks) . However , meta - analysis of data from the two RCTs [22, 23] with 209 IPF participants did not support this finding (effect size 5.25 (95% CI 8.90 to 19.40) I2= 56% p=0.467 in the sildenafil group (receiving 20mg three times daily for 12 weeks) compared to the placebo group but overall bene fit was not supported by meta -analysis of data from Zisman et al and Jackson et al : effect size 5.25 (95% CI -8.90 to 19.40), [22] that SGRQ total score remained stable in the sildenafil group (receiving 20mg three times daily for 12 weeks ) whilst worsening in placebo group (mean difference [95% CI] -4.08 [ -7.3, -0.86]). The SF -36 general health sub score was better preserved i n sildenafil group than placebo (mean difference [95% CI] 2.86 [0.76, 4.95]). This was not seen during the 12-week open label phase. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) TCM was assessed in two RCTs [25, 43] and 197 participants: one RCT [25] assessed the therapeutic effects of Feiwei granules in 77 participants. T he intervention group (n=62) received Feiwei granules twice a day for 6 months , while the control group (n=1 5) received Jinshuibao capsules, also a TCM. Participants were followed up for 6 months. Dyspnoea and SGRQ total score were significantly worse in the Feiwei granules group at baseline, and between group change in dyspnoea scores from baseline to three months was not significant (TCM group mean difference (SD) -0.6 (0.7) , control group mean difference (SD) -0.3 (0.7); p = 0.111). However, between group change in dyspnoea scores from baseline to six months (TCM group mean difference (SD) -0.8 (0.8), control group mean difference (SD) 0.1 (1.0); p = 0.001) and from three months to six months ( TCM group mean difference (SD) -0.2 (0.7), control group mean difference ( SD) 0.3 (0.7); p = 0.009) showed significant improvement in the intervention group . SGRQ total score change from baseline to three months also showed significant improvement (TCM group mean difference (SD) -8 (14), control group mean difference (SD) -1 (6) ; p = 0.011). There was no difference in change in 6MWD from baseline to three months (TCM group mean difference (SD) 17 (124), control group mean difference (SD) 19 (38); p > 0.05), baseline to six months ( TCM group mean difference (SD) 48 (107), control group mean difference (SD) 30 (54); p > 0.05 ) and from three months to six months (TCM group mean difference (SD) 31 (82), control group mean difference (SD) 11 (41); p > 0.05) . The other RCT [43] evaluated the impact of TCM foot bath combined with traditional Chinese and Western medicine nursing in 120 participants. Zeng et al 2015 [43] randomly assigned participants to four groups. There was significant improvement in anxiety and depression of participants in the combined group (traditional Chinese and Western Medicine nursing + TCM foot bath) compared to individual treatments at six months (p<0.05). Riociguat Riociguat was assessed in one RCT [48] before -and-after [46] study and 169 participants: Hoeper et al [46] carried out a small study involving 22 participants and found a non-significant increase in 6MW D (difference (SD): 25 (64), 95% CI -8 to 58) at 12 weeks in those receiving riociguat three times daily . Authors stated that no significant changes compared with baseline were seen for other relevant outcomes but no data were presented. Nathan et al [48] conducted a RCT involving 147 participants receiving either riociguat three times daily for 26 weeks or placebo . No significant improvement was noted in 6MWD for the intervention group at 26 weeks ( MD 21 m, 95% CI: -9 to 52; p>0.2). Ambulatory oxygen Oxygen was assessed in two studies (both cross -over RCTs) and 87 participants : Visca et al [50, 62] compare d two week s of ambulatory oxygen to no ambulatory oxygen in 76 participants with fibrotic ILD. Health status measured by the King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (KBILD) was significant ly improved in the intervention group for the total score (MD 3.7; 95% CI 1.8, 5. 7.6; 95% CI 1.9, 13.2; p=0.009) but not for psychological symptoms. Significant improvements were also seen on the University of California San Diego shortness of breath questionnaire (p<0.0001) and St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score ( p=0.018 ); Schaeffer et al [47] compar ed oxygen with room air (dura tion and length of follow up not reported) in 20 enrolled participants ( 11 with IPF ), and did not find any significant difference in dyspnoea . However, it is unclear how many participants were included in analysis. Corticosteroids Corticosteroids were assessed in three non-randomised studies [16, 17] and 60 participants . Hope -Gill et al [16] conducted a small open label study of prednisolone (40- 60mg/day for at least 4 weeks) in six participants with capsaicin -induced cough and found a significant reduction in mean (SE) VAS score from 7.2 (0.8) to 2.2 (2.5) at 4 weeks (p<0.05). Fiorucci et al [17] conducted a 3 -arm before and after study of 30 participants receiving prednisolone alone (group 1), prednisolone and cyclophosphamide (group 2) and prednisolone and colchicine (group 3) for 18 months . There were significant improvements in dyspnoea in the prednisolone and colchicine group compared to the other two groups. Baseline dyspnoea mean (SD) was 8.4 (2.5) versus 18 months 6.3 (2.2) (P=0.001). Two participants of group 1 (18%), one patient of group 2 (11%) and eight participants of group 3 (80%) sho wed a significant decrease in dyspnoea (p=0.001). Papiris et al [15] conducted a cohort study of 24 participants and found no difference in 6MWD between participants with an acute exacerbation of IPF ever treated and never treated with steroids. The follow up duration was not stated. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy PPI therapy was assessed in two studies (1 RCT [42] and 1 before and after study [20]) and 68 participants: The before and after study [20] assessed the effects of omeprazole 40 mg BD or lansoprazole 30 mg BD, plus ranitidine 300 mg at night for eight weeks in 14 participants. The median 24 -hour cou gh count showed a non -significant increase from baseline (p = 0.7). The matched placebo RCT assessed the effects of 20mg omeprazole twice daily in 40 participants. This study found that geometric mean cough frequency at the end of treatment, adjusted for b aseline, was 39.1% lower (95% CI 66% lower to 9.3% higher) in the omeprazole group compared with placebo. Similar results were obtained for daytime and night -time cough frequency. There was no clinically meaningful difference for patient - reported symptoms of cough and reflux. There was no significant difference in change in 6MWD. Thalidomide Thalidomide was assessed in two studies ( an open label prospective cohort trial and a cross - over RCT [12, 39] ) and 34 participants . Horton et al [12] presented data in 11 participants with chronic cough caused by IPF . There was marked to complete resolution of cough in 10 participants who received thalidomide administered daily in 100 -400mg doses for 3 months . SGRQ data showed significant decrease on the cough question from baseline 4.9 (0.3) to 2.2 (1.6) at three months (p=0.03) . A cross -over RCT of 23 participants was conducted by Horton et al (37) where 50mg (increased to 100mg after two weeks if no improvement in cough) of thalidomide was administered orally once daily for 12 weeks in a cross -over design with a two week washout . There was a significant improvement in cough MD (95% CI) -11.4 ( -15.7 compared to placebo. PA101 (cromolyn sodium) PA101 was assessed in one crossover was administered via a high -efficiency nebuliser three times daily for 14 days with washout for 14 days before crossover. The intervention group had significantly reduced cough frequency (ratio of least -squares (LS) means 0.67, 95% CI 0.48, signi was assessed placebo RCT [21] and 20 participants . Participants with cough receive d either a single inhaled dose of VRP700 (100mg) or placebo as a single dose intervention with a 7 day washout . VRP700 significantly increased cough frequency within four hours of treatment compared to placebo (136.8 (95% CI 80.3, 233.1) vs. 110.6); p < 0.001) . Reported cough severity and urge to cough were not significantly different. The authors state dyspnoea severity at 24 hours was significantly better in the VRP700 group but the data was not presented. Opioids Opioids were assessed in one before -and-after study [18] and 11 participants : Allen et al [18] administered single subcutaneous diamorphine doses to 11 IPF participants and showed a substantial fall in dyspnoea score from mean (SD) baseline 83(13) to 36 (11) at 15min and 36(12) at 30min (p<0.001). The authors also reported decreased observed anxiety (no details given). Non-pharmacological interventions Pulmonary rehabilitation and exercise training Pulmonary rehabilitation or exercise training (PR) were assessed by 22 studies (6 RCTs [28, 32, 34, 35, 41, 59] , 1 controlled clinica l trial [40], 1 prospective cohort study [27] and 14 before -and-after studies [29-31, 36, 37, 44, 51 -58]) with 748 participants in total. Among studies assessing PR, six had participants with severe di sease (DLCO % pred < 45) [31, 37, 40, 55, 57, 59] , while one study comprised a mixture of participants with severe and non - severe disease. [29] The Cochrane review [6] included five RCTs measuring dyspnoea and combined three of these in a meta -analysis. These were screened and relevant data were extracted. We identified five additional controlled trials with new data on dyspnoea of which only one could be added to the three RCTs retrieved from the Cochrane meta -analysis, and one prospective cohort study; this was considered inappropriate, as a large proportion of evidence would be omitted. The PR studies assessed dyspnoea using seven different scales. These included four uni - dimensional scales such as the Bo rg scale [86] and modifications of it, activity domain of the St Georges Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [87], dyspnoea domain of the Chronic Respirator y Disease Questionnaire (CRDQ) [88] and the Oxygen Cost Diagram (OCD) [89] as well as three multi -dimensional scales including Baseline/Transition Dyspnoea Index (BDI/TDI) [90], the Me dical Research Council (MRC) scale [91] and modifications of it, and the University of California St. Diego S hortness of Breath (UCSD SOB) questionnaire [92]. Of the seven controlled studies, three had inconsistent results from the different dyspnoea scales they used [28, 34, 41] while one study [35] found no significant improv ement. The remaining three studies did not report any significant between -group difference [32, 40, 59] . 12 before and after studies [29-31, 36, 37, 44, 51 -56] assessed dyspnoea. One study [29] found significant differences in the magnitude of change in dyspnoea immediately after PR in participants with MRC dyspnoea grades 2,3, and 5 but not in participants with MRC dyspnoea Grade 4. No significant improvement was f ound on longer follow -up. Five of these studies [30, 36, 44, 54, 56] found a statistically significant improvement in dyspnoea immediately after the intervention but did not assess its long -term sustainability. Chehere et al[55] used one uni -dimensional (Borg scale one multi -dimensional (BDI/TDI) [90] to assess dyspnoea and found contrasting results: Results from the BDI/TDI showed significant improvement while that with the Borg scale was not significant. Three othe r studies [31, 37, 51] found no si gnificant improvement in dyspnoea. Only two studies [52, 53] reported longer f ollow -up (6 months) with inconsistent results. Six RCTs measured HRQoL immediately following PR [28, 32 -35, 41] , while four of these studies involved longer follow -up [28, 32, 33, 41] . However, meta -analysis was considered inappropriate. Overall, results were inconsistent with some RCTs finding no statistically significant improvement effect. Longer follow -up showed PR had no significant improv ement effect. Ten before -and-after studies measuring HRQoL [29, 30, 36, 37, 44, 53 - 56, 58] showed inconsistent findings. A statistically significant difference between PR and control was found for change in 6MWD immediately following the intervention (n = 6 studies with 200 participants , MD 39.85 m, 95% CI 18.17 to 61.53, I2 48%, Random effects) Figure 1. At longer -term follow -up (3 or 6 months), there was no significant difference in change in 6MWD between groups (n = 4 studies with 147 participants , MD 5.26 m, 95% CI -12.88 to 23.40, I2 6%, Fixed effects) Figure 2. 11 of th e 14 before -after studies reported 6MWD; most studies found improvement in 6MWD immediately following PR. Only three studies [52, 53, 84] reported longe r (6- month) follow -up and results were contradictory. Case conference One fast-track RCT [2] evaluated the effects of a palliative care case -conference in 53 participants . The intervention was a multi -professional, holistic case -conference including symptom control and developing a home -based nurse -led individualised care plan. Mean (SD) P alliative Care Outcome scores at 4 weeks were -5.7 (7.5) fast -track vs -0.4 (8.0) control, (mean change difference between the two arms was -5.3 secondary outcomes of Qol, anxiety and depression were superior in the intervention arm, and none were worse. Qualitative findings corroborated these data. Patient and Partner Empowerment Programme (PPEPP) A controlled clinical trial [26, 85] evaluated the effect of a short multidisciplinary empowerment programme, PPEPP in 23 participants. Results showed no statistically significant change in health status, dyspnoea or HRQo L at 3 weeks and at 3 months. Disease management programme One RCT [38] evaluated a disease management program in 19 participants with mixed results . Quantitative analysis showed the intervention negative ly affected perceptions of physical Qol and a tendency for greater anxiety. The mean end Beck Anxiety Index scores for the intervention w ere 15.13 (6.92) and control w ere 8.56 (6.95) (p=0.077 ) reflecting a non - significant increase in anxiety in the intervention group . Mean (SD) end score for the SF -36 physical component showed a statistically significant difference, intervention 31.06 (4.61) versus control 36.04 (4.63) p=0.038, reflecting a negative impact on perceptions of physical health related Qol. However , qualitative analysis found participants valued the intervention and did not feel isolated. Adverse events Adverse events were reported in 15 studies assessing pharmacological interventions , namely, [12-15, 17, 22 -24, 39, 42, 45, 46, 62, 93, 94] (see online Suppl 7 for details ). In particular, seven studies described serious adverse events in studies of bosentan while three studies reported deaths in studies of corticosteroids [ 15], bosentan [45] and oxygen [50]. Birring et al [49] and Yu et al [25] reported that there were no serious adverse events in studies of cromolyn sodium and Feiwei granules respectively . Five PR studies reported that there were either no serious adverse events [34, 57] or no adverse events [29, 36, 41] at all. Discussion We have conducted the most comprehensive evidence synthesis to date providing up to date evidence on pharmacological and non -pharmacological interventions to improve symptom control , functional exercise capacity and Qol for people living with fibrotic ILD. To aid reflection on the evidence base for practitioners, policy makers and researchers, we have mapped our findings on an evidence gap map (Figure 4). Pharmacological The most tested pharmacological interventions were bosentan and sildenafil. Data on pharmacological interventions to improve symptoms - particularly dyspnoea continue to be limited. O f the drug studies, there were only four studies (n = 106 participants ) with a primary outcome of cough [19, 21, 39, 42] , and no study with a primary outcome of dyspnoea. Interestingly, c urrent ILD clinical guidelines [7, 95] recommend the use of a number of pharmacological measures ( includ ing opioids and benzodiazepines) for symptomatic management of ILD despite limited evid ence in this group. However, a recent important study by Faisal et al [96] suggests that despite very different pathological processes, ILD and COPD patients perceptual responses ( including intensity and quality) to dyspnoea are similar. In addition, there are likely to be common mechanisms of dyspnoea. Therefore, we would suggest that it is reasonable to extrapolate evidence of effectiveness of pharmacological measures that act cen trally to improve dyspnoea (eg opioids and benzodiazepines) from COPD to ILD. However, we would recommend a word of caution - whilst evidence of effectiveness may be transferred, this does not mean that safety profiles of the drugs are the same in both popul ations - as demonstrated by analyses of opioids and benzodiazepines safety data in COPD [97] and ILD. [98] The British Thoracic Society recently endorsed the occasional use of oxygen by specialist teams when breathlessness is unresponsive to all other treatment [99]. This review shows there is now some evidence for oxygen in improving symptoms and Qol in ILD patients who desaturate on exercise . However, i t remains unclear if oxygen is any more effectiv e than non - pharmacological interventi ons such as fans or cognitive behavioural therapy. In light of the many negative psychological, social and financial aspects of oxygen, further research is needed before widescale adoption of oxygen in this group. Non-pharmacological As shown by Figure 4, the most tested intervention and for which there is the strongest evidence base was PR with 47% of all studies being PR related. Studies with PR achieved short -term improvements in 6MWD. This contrasts with COPD where a reduction in dyspnoea is more co nsistent .[100] The difference in effect for PR in ILD may be related to the more fluctuating and declining nature of the disease . Among studies assessing PR, six had participants with severe disease (DLCO, % pred < 45) [31, 37, 40, 55, 57, 59] while one study comprised a mixture of participants with severe and non -severe disease. [29] Participants with more advanced disease may be less able to participate in PR and therefore it is unreasonable to expect to see the improvement seen in COPD. In ILD , the more appropriate outcome is preservation in symptoms and Qol rather than improvement per se. Whilst no clear improvement in symptoms and Qol of life is seen, a slow ing of deterioration in rapidly depreciating disease or the attainment of individualised goals are more meaningful clinical outcomes .[101] We attempted to a nalys e rate of deterioration of outcome s but were unable to do so, limited by the values presented. Furthermore, a plethora of dyspnoea assessment tools limit ed generalisability. A total of 37 studies assessed dyspnoea using 10 different scales. Of these, 19 studies were in PR using seven different scales to measure dyspnoea. As noted by Similowski [102] , dyspnoea is a complex and multi -dimensional experience that warrants a multi -dimensional tool to assess the effect of complex interventions. PR may be having a positive effect on the affective dimensions of dyspnoea which are not captured by uni -dimensional tools focussing on the symptom of dyspnoea alone (eg VAS). In contrast, multi -dimensional tools (eg CRDQ) assess the impact of dyspnoea on various domains such as activities of daily living, emotional and mental function ing, sense of mastery or other person related outcomes . Of note, for the 19 PR studies that assessed dyspnoea, four unidimensional and three multidimensional dyspnoea measures were used. A review of breathlessness tools by Bausewein et al [103] notes that there is no one scale that can accurately reflect the far -reaching effects of breathlessness in a patient with advanced disease. T hey recommend combining a uni -dimensional scale with either a disease - specific scale or a multi -dimensional scale in conjunction with other methods such as qualitative methods to fully gauge psychosocial impact of interventions to improve dyspnoea. In this evidence synthesis , only seven PR studies used both unidimensional and multidimensional measures. Recommendations The evidence gap in Figure 4 demonstrates graphically that dyspnoea is the most researched symptom and cough, the least. Research now needs to focus on pharmacological interventions to improve neglected symptoms such as cough whilst ensuring that dyspnoea is prioritised as a primary end point for future studies. The ongoing presentation of limited data and focus on improvement of outcomes is leading to discounting of the effectiveness of interventions. Given the problem of powering and the multiplicity of uncertainties listed above, an international consensus is needed on the goals of palliative interventions, the ranking of candidate primary end -point in each domain and the selection criteria for studied populations. Failure to reach such consensus may lead to similar difficulties to those in studies of acute IP F exacerbations and ILD associated with occult connective tissue disease. In both areas, lack of standardisation hindered integrating a decade of published data into an evidence base. In both areas, international consensus statements were formulated to co nfront fragmentation of research. Based on this review, research into palliative care in ILD is arguably in danger of following the same pathway. We call for a major initiative, starting with a Delphi exercise, to agree on an ongoing research agenda. Strengths and limitations Strengths of this work include a registered protocol, and a systematic and comprehensive search across multiple databases, inclusive of grey literature, with no exclusions by publication year. All screening, eligibility , data extr action and quality assessment was conducted independently by two authors, and multiple stakeholders (researchers, clinicians and patient representative) contributed to the analysis and interpretation of these data. In addition, we have for the first time, clearly mapped the evidence gap to provide a visual overview of the evidence gap for types of interventions evaluated and outcomes reported. This allows the reader to explore findings and quality of the existing evidence and facilitate informed judgement a nd evidence -based decision making . Importantly, the evidence gap map has identified key areas where little or no evidence from research is available and where future research can be focused. The main limitation of this review is the low quality of the stu dies included. Many studies were uncontrolled, with small sample sizes and unclear quality aspects. Follow -up was often short and few interventions provided evidence that could be meta -analysed. However, we have only used high quality studies in the meta -analyses and presented studies clearly to allow readers to draw their own conclusions. To limit heterogeneity, we did not include connective tissue disease associated ILDs and it is possible that there are further relevant studies available. In addition, we included studies looking at both efficacy and effectiveness as we thought it important to assess and present both. Moreover, although we did not assess for statistical evidence of publication bias, there was evidence of selective reporting where study authors did not provide data for statistically non -significant findings. Conclusion and clinical implications This evidence synthesis highlights overwhelmingly that the most researched symptom is dyspnoea and the strongest evidence base is for short -term PR. The least researched symptom was cough. The research priorities going forward must focus on prioritising and standardising meaning ful outcomes and focusing interventions on neglected symptoms . We call for a sea change in the way we conduct research in this area starting in the first instance with a Delphi exercise concluding in recommendations of a core outcome measure set.

Relevant to present rev iew: 1 3 (in 12 publications) Sildenafil: (4 studies in 3 publications) Zisman 2010, N 2005, 19: 128 -30. Thalidomide : Horton 2008, Thorax;63:749 Results (relevant outcomes) Sildenafil: on 6MWD one study found a significant improvement, but a meta -analysis of two RCTs did not (5.25 (95% CI 8.90 to 19.40)). For dyspnoea there was no overall benefit from meta -analysis. Quality of life remained stable / was better preserved in the sildenafil arm of one study than in the placebo arm but this was not seen during longer follow -up. Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Meta -analysis showed an overall significant benefit of PR on 6MWD (2 studies, mean difference 27.4, 95% CI 4.1 to 50.7) which was supported in the non-randomised studies. Effects on dyspnoea and other symptoms were mixed with a few studies finding significant ef fects on dyspnoea. Four studies found significant effects on QOL, the remaining 2 studies did not. Disease management programme: There was mixed evidence of benefit for symptoms and QOL in the one study. Diamorphine: in one study there was a significant decline in dyspnoea (weak evidence). Thalidomide : cough and quality of life were improved (weak evidence). Review conclusions There is strong evidence for the use of pulmonary rehabilitation to improve 6MWD and moderate evidence for the use of sildenafil and pulmonary rehabilitation to improve QoL. 2 Author, year, EN# Loveman 2015 [2] Study population People with a confirmed diagnosis of IPF Intervention(s) Any available and currently used (in the NHS) interventions which aim to manage symptoms or modify IPF (relevant to the present review: thalidomide, sild enafil, disease management programme, PR) Included studies, N Reference details Total 14. Relevant to present review: 5. Thalidomide : Horton 2012, Ann Intern Med;157:398 J Crit : One randomised cr ossover trial (low risk of bias) found cough, cough -related QoL and respiratory -related QoL were significantly improved with thalidomide compared with placebo. Adverse events were experienced with thalidomide. Caution is required given the small sample siz e. Sildenafil: One RCT (unclear risk of bias) found no significant difference between sildenalfil and placebo in the proportion with a 20% improvement on 6MWT (primary outcome). Dyspnoea may be improved (depending on the measure used and test conditions). QoL was better in those treated with sildenafil when measured using the SGRQ, but not when using the SF -36 or the EQ -5D. Adverse events were similar between groups. Disease management programme: One pilot RCT (unclear risk of bias) found no significant dif ferences in dyspnoea compared to usual care. QoL appeared to be adversely affected on measures of physical health but not on measures of mental health. The study was unlikely to be sufficiently powered. PR: One RCT (unclear risk of bias) and one CCT (high risk of bias) provided uncertain results as to the effects of these types of intervention, and there were baseline differences between groups on many key outcomes. Review conclusions Few interventions have any statistically significant effect on IPF and a lack of studies on palliative care approaches was identified. Research is required into the effects of symptom control interventions, in particular pulmonary rehabilitation and thalidomide. 3 Author, year, EN# Dowman et al 2014 [3] Study population People with ILD of any origin (includes sarcoidosis) Intervention(s) Pulmonary rehabilitation (any prescribed exercise training, with or without education, supervised or unsupervised, co mbined with another intervention permitted) Included studies, N Reference details 9 RCTs (6 published as abstracts only), up to 5 included in meta -analysis. (Note: RCTs with sarcoidosis not in meta -analyses) Baradzina 2005 (abstract) Holland 2008 Jackson 2014 (ahead of print) Mejia 2000 (abstract) Menon 2011 (abstract) Nishiyama 2008 Perez Bogerd 2011 (abstract) Vainshelboim 2013 (abstract) Wewel 2005 (abstract) Results (relevant outcomes) In 8 trials (n=365) PR significantly improved functional exercise capacity immediately following the programme, no significant change on 6MWD in the other 1 study. Pooled analysis of change in 6MWD from 5 RCTs (168 participants) 14%. favouring PR. GRADEa: quality. No significant effect of PR evident on 6MWD in 2 studies reporting longer -term follow -up (3 and 6 months respectively). In 5 trials (n=281) 3 reported reduced dyspnoea following PR; 2 reported no change in dyspnoea. Pooled analysis of 3 studies (113 partici pants) SMD for change I2 49%, in favour of PR. GRADEa: low quality. No significant effect of PR evident on dyspnoea in 1 study reporting a 6 -month follow -up. In 8 trials measured HRQoL and 3 found significant d ifferences immediately following PR (2 others non -significant improvements, remaining 3 unclear). Pooled analysis of 3 studies (106 participants) SMD 0.59 (95% CI 0.20, 0.98) I2 0%. in favour of PR. GRADEa: low quality. No significant effect of PR evident on HRQoL in 2 studies reporting longer -term follow - up (3 and 6 months respectively). Subgroup analyses by subtype of ILD reported, not extracted. No adverse events in two studies that reported it. Review conclusions PR seems to be safe for peopl e with ILD. Improvements in functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea and quality of life are seen immediately following pulmonary rehabilitation, with benefits also evident in IPF. Because of inadequate reporting of methods and small numbers of included part icipants, the quality of evidence was low to moderate. Little evidence was available regarding longer -term effects of pulmonary rehabilitation. 4 Appendix B: Search strategy Medline search Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL 1946 to January 14, 2019 1. idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.tw. 2. interstitial Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis/dt, pc, rh, su [Drug Therapy, Prevention & Control, Rehabilitation, Surgery] 8.
