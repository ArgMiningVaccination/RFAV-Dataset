Today, I am thrilled to dive into a crucial framework that empowers organizations to understand and appreciate the value of nature, enabling them to make well-informed decisions regarding their impacts and dependencies. Join me on this enlightening journey as we explore the [Natural Capital Protocol](https://capitalscoalition.org/capitals-approach/natural-capital-protocol/?fwp_filter_tabs=guide_supplement) and its invaluable companion, the [Natural Capital Toolkit](https://shift.tools/contributors/551). The Natural Capital Protocol serves as a comprehensive guide for organizations, providing a structured approach to identify, measure, and value their direct and indirect impacts on natural capital. It revolves around four key stages, each centered around essential questions: Why is natural capital important to our organization? What are our impacts and dependencies on natural capital? How can we measure and value these impacts? And finally, what should be our next steps to address these impacts and dependencies effectively? It is inspiring to witness the increasing number of global businesses that are embracing the Natural Capital Protocol and utilizing the sector-specific guides. Prominent companies such as [The Coca-Cola Company], [HUGO BOSS], [Shell], [Nestl\u00e9], and many others have recognized the importance of integrating natural capital considerations into their business decisions. These forward-thinking organizations represent diverse sectors and operate across various regions worldwide. But that's not all. Complementing the Natural Capital Protocol is the [Natural Capital Toolkit](https://shift.tools/contributors/551), a treasure trove of over 50 tools designed to support businesses in conducting natural capital assessments across their operations. Accessible, interactive, and completely free, the Toolkit offers a wide range of methodologies and resources that enhance understanding, measurement, and decision-making related to natural capital. By leveraging these tools, organizations can gain a deeper appreciation of their true costs, true profits, and true value. It is worth noting that the Natural Capital Toolkit operates as a dynamic resource, constantly updated with the latest insights and innovations in the field of natural capital. This ensures that organizations have access to the most relevant and effective tools to guide their sustainability efforts. Furthermore, within the context of the logistics sector, the Protocol recommends utilizing the Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. I will delve deeper into the GLEC Framework in my upcoming newsletter, highlighting its significance in addressing emissions and environmental impacts within the logistics industry. By embracing the Natural Capital Protocol and leveraging the powerful Natural Capital Toolkit, organizations can enhance their understanding, measurement, and decision-making when it comes to addressing natural capital depletion.
