More than 20 new applications were accepted, and at least as many projects are ongoing. Our repository was enriched with new sample collections, and metabolomics data returned from Nightingale Health to be shared with the wider research community; thus demonstrating the value of biobanking. Our biobank team participated the Europe Biobank Week congress in Antwerpen with a talk and 6 posters to share ideas and enhance collaboration. We are lucky to have a dedicated and future-oriented team which has made it possible to aim high and meet the goals! GDPR We prepared our biobank for GDPR by carrying out a Privacy Impact Assessment and updating our processes. Our tasks to comply with GDPR were not too demanding, as the Biobank Act already set strict requirements for data processing since 2013. Given that the data protection compliance is not a one-time effort, it must be continuously embedded in everyday operations. SUPER The Finnish SUPER study on genetic mechanisms of psychotic disorders successfully achieved its goal by recruiting more than 10.000 Finnish participants in three years. THL Biobank's role was key both in the management of the field work and in processing all the collected samples. Warm thanks to the participants and the study nurses! FinnGen The FinnGen research project, which aims to combine genomic and health data from 500.000 Finnish individuals to promote drug discovery and disease prevention, started in autumn 2017. THL Biobank provided a huge kick-start for FinnGen: Existing genomic data from 76.000 sample donors formed the starting point for this large international collaboration project. Additionally, our DNA laboratory exceeded all expectations by processing ca 90.000 DNA samples for genotyping with top quality performance. Well done lab team! BBMRI.fi and the European Biobank Network BBMRI-ERIC THL coordinated successfully also this year the Finnish Biobank Network BBMRI.fi, which obtained top marks in the mid-term evaluation by the Finnish Academy. We thank BBMRI.fi coordinator Anu Jalanko for her outstanding work. THL Biobank also continued its contribution in developing BBMRI-ERIC's Common Service IT, leading the work on defining the MIABIS standard for sharing biobank data. THL Biobank's DNA sample collections were among the first to be awarded with quality grades by BBMRI-ERIC for meeting the quality criteria according to CEN/TS standards. Celebrating 5 year anniversary in 2019 In March 2019 THL Biobank has operated for five years and it's time to celebrate! We are thrilled to continue to develop our biobank's operations and services to meet the future demands of biomedical research and innovation activities in the post-GWAS era. Stay tuned to learn more about the festivities! We thank our great research community, collaborators and customers all over the world and look forward to seeing what we can achieve in the future by working together. Most importantly, we thank our sample donors for their generous support to Finnish research. Best wishes for the holiday season and Happy New "}
