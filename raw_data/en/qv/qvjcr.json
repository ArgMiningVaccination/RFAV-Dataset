Dr. Schreiber, a licensed chiropractor, founded Lux Vitae Wellness, LLC in Troy, Illinois on August 9th, 2010 with the vision of empowering each individual on their journey to health. She is excited about sharing what she has personally found as life-enhancing healthcare such as regular chiropractic adjustments paired with high-quality, fluoride-free H20 from the Tyent Water Ionizer, Doterra Essential Oils, the Richway Biomat, and Standard Process products. Growing up in a small Midwestern town just East of the Mississippi, Dr. Schreiber was first introduced to chiropractic care at the age of 16 after her vehicle was T-boned on the driver's side, throwing her into oncoming traffic. After going the traditional medical route and a few months of physical therapy, she was introduced to a local chiropractor, receiving complete relief in just a couple months. While attending Logan College of Chiropractic, she founded the Logan College Wellness Club and was later mentored by an upper cervical doctor in Des Peres, Missouri who introduced her to the history of chiropractic and the concept of upper cervical chiropractic care...scientifically, it made sense due to the high concentration of mechanoreceptors in the upper area of the spine. During that time, Dr. Schreiber met up with a few individuals at Dynamic Essentials in Marietta, Georgia who spoke about a \"Lasting Purpose\" and a \"Give, Love, Serve\" mentality. After learning more of how chiropractic came to be and the plethora of techniques out there, she decided to transfer to Life Chiropractic College West in California in order to be the most highly trained chiropractor possible. In order to best support her profession in protecting the foundational principles that chiropractic was founded on - no drugs or surgery - in 2018 as a member of the California Chiropractor's Association, Dr. Schreiber teamed up with chiropractors from all over the state to lobby for AB 888, which would require stricter regulations from medical doctors in prescribing an opioid for the course of a treatment. This bill also required that medical doctors recommend adjunct methods of treatment such as acupuncture and chiropractic care. In 2019, Dr. Schreiber became the President for the International Chiropractor's Association (Life West Chapter) to support this mission. She participated in various private healing retreats in Northern California, before relocating to her hometown in Troy, Illinois. Continuously advancing her efforts, she is an active member of the American Chiropractor's Association, the League of Chiropractic Women, the International Federation of Chiropractors and Organizations, the Illinois Chiropractic Society, the Association for the History of Chiropractic, and the Silver Creek Rotary Club. Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine that mainly deals with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. A chiropractor uses spinal adjustments, manipulation, and other techniques to manage patients' health concerns, including neck pain, back pain, headaches, vertigo and a long list of other ailments and conditions. They aim to improve patients' functionality and quality of life by properly aligning the body's musculoskeletal structure and enabling the body to heal itself naturally, without the use of medication or surgery.
