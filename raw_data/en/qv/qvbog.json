The EU could green light its first coronavirus vaccine on Monday, raising the prospect that many Europeans will soon get their shot. The BioNTech/Pfizer jab works like most vaccines by showing the body's immune system what the virus looks like so it can remember the next time it's infected. But it's based on a brand new messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology that makes it different from any other jabs we've had before. While scientists have been testing this process for years in other diseases like cancer, the urgent need for a coronavirus vaccine accelerated its development, not only for the BioNTech/Pfizer shot but also in coronavirus vaccines from Moderna, Curevac and Imperial College. Meanwhile, there are many non-mRNA options in the works too. POLITICO dug into the science behind the coronavirus vaccine. The guide below is based on a conversation with Zolt\u00e1n Kis, a research associate at Imperial College's Future Vaccine Manufacturing Hub. You may like Why is the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine unique? BioNTech/Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine is a world-first for use [in the U.K.](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1537441) and [the U.S.](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/11/fda-first-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-444668) earlier this month. Messenger RNA is the molecule that carries genetic information in our cells. It's the link between our genes (the DNA) and the product of the gene (the protein) \u2014 so our cells use it all the time to translate genetic code into the building blocks of life. Coronavirus vaccines that contain mRNA carry the genetic information to produce the spike protein, the antigen of the vaccine that gives you immunity. This is produced inside our muscles \u2014 so in effect, our bodies become mini-factories \"manufacturing\" the protein as opposed to scientists making it in a lab and injecting it into the body. What happens when you get injected? The BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine comes in a liquid injection, which contains natural tiny oily particles called lipid nanoparticles. Each of these microscopic spheres contains the mRNA molecule. The small droplets are the same structure as the cell membranes, so they can fuse with the membrane allowing the mRNA to enter the cells. The lipids also stabilize the mRNA, which is a very fragile molecule. Once inside the cells, they will produce the spike protein. Once you have the antigen, the immune system recognizes this as a foreign entity and attacks it using antibodies and T-cells. The immune system learns how to destroy the spike protein, so if the virus enters the body, it will recognize it and destroy it. What's the benefit of this new technology? Messenger RNA vaccines do not contain the virus, so there's less risk of the vaccination actually triggering COVID-19. But the trade-off is that the mRNA molecule is unstable. This is why some need to be stored at very low temperatures, otherwise the molecule can break down. The Moderna vaccine is the other frontrunner. Does that work the same way? Yes. The only difference is the composition of the lipid spheres. There are four types of lipid nanoparticles used to hold the mRNA \u2014 the ratios of these lipids as well as whether they are positively or negatively charged is what differentiates the vaccines, and also means they require different storage conditions. BioNTech/Pfizer's jab is stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius, and Moderna's at minus 20 degrees. This makes Moderna's jab easier to distribute. They also have different amounts of mRNA: Moderna has 100 micrograms per dose, while BioNTech/Pfizer has 30 micrograms. So the latter can manufacture more doses more quickly. Both require two doses i.e. two injections, several weeks apart. How do other mRNA vaccines compare? The BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna jabs use a process to modify one of the four building blocks \u2014 the nucleotides \u2014 that form the mRNA. Studies have shown this makes it work better inside cells and stops the immune system from attacking the fragile mRNA. This modification was [the big scientific ah-ha moment](https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/10/the-story-of-mrna-how-a-once-dismissed-idea-became-a-leading-technology-in-the-covid-vaccine-race/) back in 2005. Another shot from Curevac \u2014 the company that's been working the longest on mRNA vaccines \u2014 doesn't use a modified building block in making its mRNA. Instead, it uses naturally occurring nucleotides. It is also investigating using a lower dose of mRNA. Both of these differences could make Curevac's coronavirus vaccine cheaper to produce. Early signs [suggest](https://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/curevac_says_its_covid-19_vaccine_can_be_stored_at_standard_refrigerator_temperature_1356911) it could be stable in a regular fridge, at around 5 degrees Celsius. The vaccine is currently in Phase 2 trials. It's a similar story for a fourth vaccine in the works from Imperial College in London. It uses a much lower dose, at just 1 microgram of mRNA per injection, because the mRNA has been designed to make copies of itself once it's injected into the muscle. If successful, Imperial College's process could be the cheapest, requiring one-hundredth of the dose of Moderna's jab. It's currently in a combined Phase 1/2 trial, expected to complete early next month. Are there other options? Several other vaccines \u2014 Oxford/AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, Russia's Sputnik vaccine and some Chinese ones \u2014 are based on a more traditional, adenovirus viral vector technology. That involves injecting a modified version of the common cold, carrying genetic information coded in DNA, into the muscle to produce the spike protein. The risk with this technology is that the body recognizes the material as a foreign entity, resulting in an immune response that may destroy some of a second vaccine dose before it kicks in. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vector uses a common cold from a chimpanzee, so the human immune system should not recognize it. The Russian vaccine uses two very rare human cold viruses, and patients are given one of each in the two-dose regimen. Scientists are already talking about [combining](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1549359) these types of vaccines as part of a two-dose regimen, to avoid an immune response after the second dose. The upside is they are far easier to transport and deliver. While those named above are the leading contenders, the majority of coronavirus vaccines in clinical development today are actually protein-based vaccines, making up [30 percent](https://www.who.int/publications/m/item/draft-landscape-of-covid-19-candidate-vaccines) of the 56 being tested in people. Among them is Novavax's vaccine. This uses an older technology than the adenovirus vectors. The spike protein is produced in large bioreactors inside living cells. Novavax uses insect cells but yeast or human cultured cells are also commonly used, with cells made in a way so they can replicate forever \u2014 usually in a big liquid soup of 2,000 liters or more. Flu jabs, the hepatitis B vaccine and the HPV jab are made this way, as is GlaxoSmithKline/Sanofi's coronavirus vaccine. But in trials of that option, they recently [reported](https://www.politico.eu/?p=1548577) a setback. "}
