We had an interesting case: a patient who had a typical mite rash and a dead hamster with red mites. It is well documented in the dermatology literature that the red bird mite (D. gallinae) can cause a rash in humans. Could this mite also infest a hamster? I have attached a photo of the mite and hamster. Is it possible to identify the mite from the photo? or narrow the possibilities? Also, I have read a little about the tropical rat mite (O. bacoti) also affecting humans, could this mite be that? Anyone who could help with information would be appreciated. I am interested in presenting this case to other dermatologists. Thank you.

Some years ago, we had a case of O. bacoti infesting a captive colony of wild Microtus species. The rodents were largely wiped out, and some biting of the lab workers was reported. - Barry OConnor ------------------------------------------------------------------------- So many mites, so little time! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Barry M.

Parasites of Laboratory Animals. Iowa State University, Press Ames. p. 426. ;-)) Answering your questions: YES IT CAN, AND DO IT! I didn't see the mite's photo ;-(( YES!! it could! ;-) Please see these medicals aspects: These mites feed themselves with blood and cause debility, anemy, and hamster's dead. O. bacoti, can transmit the agents of murine typhus, (Rickettsia typhus), rickyysialpox (R. akari), Q fiver, (Coxiella burneti) and pestis (Francisella pestis),but it isn't the most important vector of those. It is the most common vector of Litomosoides carinii. There are possibilities of infection in \"lab mouses, hamsters\" of those above or others. When no mouse in the house ;-) they can attack men and causing very painful allergic dermatitis! Thanking in advance for giving me this opportunity to help, Your's Sincerely, Isaac Dr. Isaac Aisenberg Ferenhof M.D / D.V.M. >>>>ferenhof@intermega.com.br<<<< RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL. CC: Lincoln.smtp(\"naombc@yahoo.com\") Dear Slava ;-) It is a great honor to reply your question. Please have the kindness to read: YUNKER, C. 1973. Parasits of Laboratory Animals. Iowa State Univ. Press Ames.pp:14,426. In our studies we found that \"hamsters mites\" are from \"Mesostigmata's\" and \"Macronyssidae\" Sincerely, Isaac Dear Entomologist 1. This week we will display on our homepage all the abstracts received by the Scientific Committee. We will inform the address where you can check if yours was well received. 2. Due to unexpected requests for parallel meetings during the ICE, we were forced to change one of the locations of our congress. Hotel Carima isn't anymore official place or official hotel of the Congress, as we needed more room space. We moved to a brand new Event and Entertainment Center, at the same site of Bourbon and Mabu, the other officials hotels. Participants that had reservations at the Carima will be transferred to same or better category hotels, at the same price announced for Carima. Pls, wait the contact from Oliveira Travel, the Official Agency. Participants that would stay at Carima anyway will have his (her) right respected, but the Congress will not provide free transportation to/from this hotel. 3. Any of you facing problems with air ticket reservation should contact immediately the Official Agency (Oliveira Travel - oliveiratravel@pjeventos.com.br) to make the necessary arrangements. Pls inform you complete name, flight number date and time of arrival at Brazilian airports on your mail. Yours Decio Luiz Gazzoni President, XXI ICE Dear all in the list: I would like to consult your knowledge about tick control for prevention of transmission of diseases to humans. I have some information about the control of Ixodes scapularis, but none about the control of Dermacentor or Amblyomma for prevention of rickettsiosis, for example. Other doubt I would like to solve, is the identification of tick species of medical importance in Central and South America. I would greatly appreciate any help I can receive in this sense.

We are arranging a program and there is time to accept other registrations and abstracts. We hope that the scientific contributions, the discussion on them, and the exchange of stimulating ideas with colleagues will constitute a good reason to meet again. Dear colleague take account about the invited spekers lectures: - Salvatore Ragusa (Palermo, Italy) \"A survey on the Italian Acarologist (non definitive title)\" Session: Phylogeny and evolution - Richard H. Thomas (London, United Kingdom) \"Molecular biology and development of the oribatid, Archegozetes longisetosus\" - Brian Fenton of water mites (Acari: Parasitengona: Hydrachnidia) in running water and spring habitats - present state of our knowledge and needs for future research\". - Gerd Alberti (Greifswald, Germany) \"Reproductive systems of and parasitism. Medical and veterinary aspects\". - Serge Kreiter France) \"Future prospects in agricultural acarology\". - Danuta Kropczynska (Warsaw, Poland) (Non available title) Session: Evolutionary ecology and life-strategy - M.W. Sabelis (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) \"Life history plant inhabiting mites: ecological determinants and phylogenetic constraints\" Moreover we have found a few hours for a round table intitled \"How to see then future of Acarology\" (Chair: Serge Kreiter) which would be an occasion of constructive discussion on our research. Please, could you give this information to the colleagues we cannot contact by e-mail and that could be interested in EURAAC Symposium. So, if you are still interested we will be really happy to receive news from you. Sincerely yours, President Fabio Bernini PS. For more information you could contact the Scientific Secretariat (euraac2000@unisi.it) or visit our website http://www.unisi.it/ricerca/dip/bio_evol/sitoeuraac/siena2000.html Fabio Bernini Department of Evolutionary Biology University of Siena via P.A. Mattioli, 4 - 53100 Siena ITALY Dear Entomologist Pls find at www.embrapa.br/ice/abstract.htm the list of abstracts received at our secretariat. They are in alphabetical order of the name of the file. So Jerry London should look for the file j.london, jerry-london, jerry_london, london, or london1, usually the same filename as you sent to us. We estimate that 5% of the files arrived contaminated with viruses. Some we could identify and asked the sender to send it again after cleaning. But some viruses halted the system and deleted automatically the email, so we have no idea who sent it. So, pls look if your abstract is on the list. If you have any doubt, pls contact caio@cnpso.embrapa.br After this first confirmation, we will place information regarding the session to which the abstract is linked, and finally information regarding oral and poster presentation. Remember that June 30rd is the deadline for registering at the ICE with partially reduced fee. Follow the procedures on our homepage for registration. Yours Decio Luiz GazzoniPresident, XXI ICE Colleagues, John Kethley recently told me of the existence of this website concerning the American acarologist Maurice Farrier. There is a biography and guide to his paper/manuscript collection. Some of you may be interested. http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/archives/collections/html/farrier.html R. Norton Roy A. Norton SUNY-College of Environmental Science & Forestry 1 Forestry Drive Syracuse, New York USA 13210 Fax: (315) 470 6934 Email: ranorton@mailbox.syr.edu Dear Colleagues, As an \"Acarologist\" you get all kinds of questions from the audience. One is: How big can a tick be? Does anyone know the \"World-record\" of what a tick can consume? I have one statement of a Hyalomma asiaticum taking a blood meal of more than 8 ml (which, by the way, is close to the volume of my thumb up to the first joint!). Best regards Lars Lundqvist Lund University, Sweden Lars.Lundqvist@zool.lu.se ************************************************************************ It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. To know how to criticize is good, but to know how to create is better. -- Henri Poincare Hi Lars, With respect to \"the largest tick\" there is a brochure from the US National Tick Collection which feature a photograph of a \"female tick\" feeding on a gopher tortoise. These specimens (the tick, that is) can be up to an inch long and i/2 inch thick. Perhaps Jim Kierans could supply more information. I too am interested in these \"Gee Whiz\" figures as I call them. I am in the process of compiling a collection of tick superlatives. The most amazing to me is the number of ticks on one host. That is: Welch et al reported in 1990 that in a captive 2.5 yr old male reindeer that died in zoo in Edmonton Nov. 1988 had 411,661 Dermacentor albipictus ticks on it (=25 ticks/cm2). This fact is from Bill Samuels, a well known moose researcher (I believe). Best wishes, Jim Occi Many many thanks to everyone who helped me with my final year project - I got a first (Wahey!!) and couldnt have done it without your help. Cheers :o) Rachel (house dust mites project) List, Attached is a sketch of a mite that was sent to me from a Dr. whose house (and bed) these have been infesting. My attempts at keying them our using \"How to know the Mites and Ticks\" is limited by my current lack of a compound microscope. These might Dermanyssus or Ornithonyssus, but I cannot locate a similar appearing drawing. I realize the limitations of a crude drawing such as this, can someone suggest additional key characters that I might look for to properly identify these? I should be able to find my compoound microscope or use our college instruments soon. B. Hebert Pasadena, CA Date: Thu, 15 (Hans Klompen) Subject: ASA Annual Meeting update IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING SUBMISSION OF INFORMAL CONFERENCE (SUBMITTED/CONTRIBUTED) PAPERS AND ABSTRACTS FOR THE 2000 ASA MEETING IN MONTREAL. All regular and student-competition 10-minute oral papers for this year's meeting of the Acarological Society of America (ASA) in Montreal on Sunday, 3 December must be submitted through the Entomological Society of America's (ESA) electronic submissions system. This can be accessed from the ESA website at <www.entsoc.org>, then clicking on \"Annual Meeting\" and following the instructions for submitting your paper. Unfortunately, ESA did not set up a separate category for ASA Informal Conference paper submissions and has therefore asked that all such papers be added to the Acarology Formal Conference (Formal Conference 1). After the 27 June deadline for abstract submissions, ESA and ASA representatives will separate the Formal Conference papers from those destined for the Informal Conference. We apologize for this unorthodox method of submitting ASA Informal Conference (submitted/contributed) papers. Heroic measures were taken by ASA officers, particularly Hans Klompen, to ensure that a separate ASA Informal Conference category would be set up on the ESA electronic submissions site but, for unknown reasons, it did not happen. Even with the additional step of submitting all ASA papers into the ASA Formal Conference, the abstract submission system is user friendly. However, if any problems arise, Carolyn DeSimon at the ESA National Office has asked that you contact her either by telephone (301-731-4535 Ext. 3016) or by e-mail (<carolyn@entsoc.org>). CALL FOR 2000 ACAROLOGY STUDENT COMPETITION PAPERS AND TRAVEL AWARDS The ASA will hold its 2000 Outstanding Student Paper Competition during the Acarology Submitted Papers Session at the annual meeting of the ESA in Montreal, Quebec (Dec. 3-7, 2000). We invite all interested graduate students working on Acarines to submit a paper to the Contributed Papers Session of the Acarology Informal Conference. Please submit an abstract to ESA and to Dr. Ellen Dotson by June 27, 2000. To enter your contribution using the ESA electronic submission system, submit your contribution under \"Formal Conference Acarology\" (see above). In addition, the ASA is awarding a $150 of travel funds to an outstanding graduate student presenting their research at the Acarology Informal Conference. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is June 27, 2000. If you would like an application for a Travel Award or wish further information regarding either award, please contact Dr. Ellen Dotson, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NCID, ebd6@cdc.gov.

Judith Mendiola Instituto Pedro Kour\u00ed E-mail: mendiola@ipk.sld.cu Dear Lars, We semi- engorged Amblyomma pomposum females in the Onderstepoort measure plus/minus 2,5 X 2,5 X 1,5 cm. Maybe somebody who has worked in Angola will have some fully engorged specimens. Regarding many ticks on a host: Sir Arnold Theiler, 1st Director of the Onderstepoort Veterinary Laboratory, collected 6kg (14lb) of Boophilus decoloratus ticks from a horse over a period of 3 days. The horse died of subsequent acute anaemia. Heloise Heloise Heyne Tel no. 27 Vet. 2000 Dear Acarologist: The XIth International Congress of Acarology will be held in Merida, Mexico during September 8-13, 2002. This will be our first international congress of the 21st century and an appropriate venue to release an updated Directory of Acarologists of the World, which will both ensure communication between acarologists and help promote our discipline. The previous Directory, prepared by Dr. Cal Welbourn, and published in 1992, was a monumental compilation, including data on nearly 1900 acarologists from 84 countries. It has proved an invaluable source over the years; however, as with all Directories, it needs updating. We on the International Executive Committee (IEC) propose that the Directory 2002 will be available on the internet, and on computer disc, that will be free to the acarological community. Dr. Zhi-Qiang Zhang has kindly offered to host the Directory on the Acarology homepage (http://www.nhm.ac.uk/hosted_sites/acarology/) when it is compiled. The information we ask is the following: TITLE FIRST NAME LAST NAME ADDRESS E-MAIL ADDRESS HOME PAGE URL (WWW ADDRESS) PHONE FAX TAXONOMIC GROUPS STUDIED AREAS OF SPECIALIZATION (i.e., physiology, systematics etc.) Could you send me the above information (by letter, phone, fax, or e-mail) and I will ensure it is included in the Directory of Acarologists of the World 2002. We intend the Directory 2002 to be inclusive as possible, so please pass on this request to acarologists I may have overlooked. On behalf of the IEC, thank you for your participation. Val Behan-Pelletier Executive Secretary, IEC Biodiversity Program Eastern Cereal & Oilseed Research Centre K. W. Neatby Bldg., 960 Carling 2000 12:07:30 +0200 Dear readers, I was asked, if it's true that the house (?) mites Dermatophagoides spp. - which live in many of our homes - can't survive at an altitude of more than 2000 m a.s.l. due to the low atmospheric pressure. Thinking by myself that it's not the atmospheric pressure but the low temperatures (= low humidity in the houses because of heating) and the low density of habitats (= buildings), I'm asking you what's the reason and where these mites originally come from? Did they strongly \"co-evolute\" with human beings or do they also live outside buildings? Thanks a lot, Gernot! P.S. Do reply to my private email account, please, since I'm not subscribed to the list! are trying to standardize the determination of acaricidal properties of textile sold with the tittle \"anti-acariens\" Did anybody develop and publish this kind of acaricidal test? I should be pleased to get some new references or standard norma friendly christian.bories@cep.u-psud.fr EAD 398 Biologie et Controle Chatenay-Malabry cedex FRANCE phone. 33 (0)1 46 83 55 53 fax 33 (0)1 46 83 55 57 06 85 42 28 73 Although the phylogenetic work has not been completed within the family, it is clear from the natural distribution of species in the family Pyroglyphidae, and the phylogenetic position of the family in the Analgoid lineage, that the ancestral Pyroglyphid mite was a parasite of a bird. Early derivative pyroglyphids (subfamily Paralgopsinae) are intra-quill parasites, and some more derivative mites (subfamily Onychalginae) are skin ectoparasites of bird hosts. The remaining Pyroglyphidae form a likely monophyletic group whose ancestor left the bird host for the nest environment. Within that lineage, different mites have colonized human habitations on several occasions. This is clear because each of the common \"dust mites\" has close relatives which still inhabit bird nests rather than human habitations. So the answer is clear that these mites have not co-evolved with humans, but have repeatedly colonized habitations from the ancestral bird nest habitats. They have also colonized other mammal nest habitats as well (e.g. the genus Pyroglyphus (s.s.) inhabiting American wood-rat houses). +0200 > >Dear readers, > >I was asked, if it's true that the house (?) mites Dermatophagoides spp. - >which live in many of our homes - can't survive at an altitude of more >than >2000 m a.s.l. due to the low atmospheric pressure.

In an effort to kill potential parasites and pathogens that may be contaminants in the culture media, I am considering pretreating the media. However, I am also concerned that if, for example, I use a thermal treatment which is too severe, I may destroy some of the nutritional components of the media. Can anyone offer any guidance or suggest any publications which might help me to solve this problem. Thank you very much for your kind assistance. vespamg@aol.com Hello everybody, I am currently gathering a list of oribatid species living in caves. However, the ecology of 5 species doesn't seem clear to me. Muller, 1859 If somebody collected or read a paper speaking of one of these species, I would be very interested in knowing if it was from a cave or not.
