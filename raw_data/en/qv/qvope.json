Time hasnot diminished that challenge. By October 1987, acumulative total of 1,964 confirmed AIDS cases hadbcen reported among inmates in the nation's prisonsand its largest jailsan increase of 156 percent overthe first survey of inmate AIDS cases in 1985. (Thatstaggering increase is still less than the 187 percentincrease in confirmed AIDS cases among the generalpopulation during the same time period.) Correctionaladministrators thus continue to face tough decisionsabout institutional management, the best and mostequitable means of identifying and treating inmateswith AIDS, potential legal issues, and the costs ofmedical care. Policymakers and correcticns officialscannot afford to wait until medical science producesan ultimate answer. To effectively address the problemtoday, they need the most accurate and up-to-dateinformation available.In late 1985, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ)began its first study of AIDS in prisons and jails andhas, since then, annually surveyed and reported on theincidence and institutional management of AIDSwithin the federal and state prison systems as well asin the nation's largest jails. Over 8,000 copies of thefirst and second editions, and the 1986 Update havebeen distributed on request to date. This document,the third edition of AIDS in Correctional Facilities:Issues and Options, represents a complete revision ofthe original report. It provides the most current figuresand trend data on the incidence of AIDS among in-carcerated offenders. It reviews bath the policy optionsand the range of correctional practice with respect totesting, housing, medical care, and education pro-grams. Current information on costs is summarizedand the status of relevant legal issues and recent litiga-tion is discussed.This report is but one part of NIJ's ongoing effort toassist correctional administrators and other criminaljustice professionals in meeting the challenge of AIDS.NIJ's AIDS and the Law Enforcement Officer: Con-cerns and Policy Responses, examines AIDS-relatedpolicies, training programs, and appropriate precau-tionary measures in the context of current medicalknowledge and the day-to-day realities of law en-forcement. A study now underway is examining theissues which AIDS raises for probation and paroleprofessionals.In mid-1987, the Institute also established the NIJAIDS Clearinghouse to provide a centralized nationalsource of information about how AIDS affectscriminal justice professionals and their work. Withinthe first two months of operation, the Clearinghousereceived over 700 calls and requests from federal, stateand local criminal justice agencies. The Clearinghousegathers and disseminates AIDS-related informationdeveloped by NIJ, the Centers for Disease Control,other agencies of the U.S. Public Health Service, andthe Department of Justice, as well as selected materialsprepared by professional organizations, state and localgovernm, ts, and criminal justice agencies throughoutthe U.S. As part of the Clearinghouse, NIJ instituteda new publication series, AIDS Bulletin short,nontechnical summaries of AIDS-related criminaljustice topics.The HIV epidemic places enormous stress on alreadyoverburdened correctional systems. Current and ac-curate information can place corrections officials ina stronger position to address the problem of AIDS,provide sound education and training, ensure equitabledelivery of services, and develop reasoned and effec-tive management policies. Correctional administratorsand managers have already done much to meet thechallenge of AIDS. The National Institute of Justicehopes that this volume will be of assistance in theircontinued efforts.

This has been due to perceptionsthat prisons and jails hold high coacentrations of in-dividuals at risk of developing AIDS as a result of priorintravenous drug abuse and that correctional inmatesfrequently engage in behaviors likely to spread thedisease particularly homosexual activity.Purposes of this DocumentThis document is intended to be informational ratherthan prescriptive. The issues affecting the correctionalresponse to AIDS are too complex for simple policyformulas. In the two years since the first edition ofthis report appeared, most correctional systems haveadopted policies regarding AIDS. Certain principles,such as the importance of inmate and staff educationon AIDS, are indisputable. However, many key policyissuesparticularly HIV antibody testing, housing ofinfectedinmates, and precautionary measurescontinue to spark controversy both within and outsidecorrectional systems. Correctional systems have oftenfound themselves under political pressure to adopt cer-tain policies. The National Institute of Justice hassponsored this entirely revised edition of the report torespond to the continuing needs of correctional ad-ministrators for up-to-date information as they addressa range of difficult and complex policy issues. Thefollowing categories of information appear to be inparticular demand:up-to-date medical and epidemiologicalfacts on AIDS;concise statements of the major facts andissues affecting the correctional responseto AIDS;a broad base of information on AIDS-related policies and procedures currently inforce or in development in correctionalsystems nationwide; anddelineation of the range of specific policyoptions available to administrators fordealing with this complex and difficultproblem.This document seeks to provide these tyk n of infor-mation and to present as fairly and objectively as possi-b!e the rationales advanced for various policy options.It is also hoped that the report will facilitate informa-tion exchange across jurisdictions and, ultimately, thedevelopment of consensus on the most effective andappropriate poli :ies and procedures for addressingAIDS in correctional facilities.Intended Audiences for this DocumentThis document is directed to all officials who may beinvolved in making and implementing decisions regard-ing the correctional response to AIDS. This includesthe following groups: correctional commissioners;other correctional administrators at both the depart-mental and institutional levels; correctional medicaldirectors and other medical staff at both the depart-mental and institutional levels;public healthauthorities; legal staff of correctional departments;and legislators and other decisionmakers consideringlaws or policy initiatives related to AIDS in correc-tional facilitiese.g., budgets for prison constructionand staffing and laws or policies requiring confiden-tiality of AIDS-related medical information.Study MethodologyThe data and information presented in this report weregathered from the following major sources:responses to a national mail questionnaire;site visits to five correctional systems withvarying policies regarding AIDS;aggregate data provided by the Centers forDisease Control (CDC);interviews with medical authorities and cor-rectional officials; andan extensive literature review.A mail questionnaire was sent to the correctionaldepartments of all fifty states, the federal prisonsystem, thirty-seven large city and county jail systems,and twelve Canadian systems. (A list of the city andcounty jail systems and Canadian correctional systemswho responded to the questionnaire is included in Ap-pendix C.) The questionnaire included basic questionson inmate population, numbers of inmate cases ofAIDS and ARC, and aggregate results of HIV anti-body testing programs, as well as a series of questionson major policies regarding AIDS (training and educa-tion, testing, medical and psycho-social services, hous-Introduction and Summary xi ing, precautionary measures, confidentiality) andassociated legal and cost issues. We obtained an overallresponse rate of 96 percent to the questionnaire: 100percent for states and the federal system; 89 percentfor city/county systems; and 100 percent for Canadiansystems. Following extensive telephone callbacks torespondents to clarify answers, the questionnaires werecoded and analyzed using the microcomputer versionof the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences(SPSS/PC). All data in this report are current as ofOctober 1987 - December 1987, the period duringwhich all questionnaire responses were prepared.Questionnaire respondents were assured that data onthe numbers of AIDS and ARC cases would not bereported by state or jurisdiction. Thus, we do not iden-tify particular numbers of cases with particularjurisdictions. Moreover, respondent jurisdictions weregiven the option of remaining fully anonymous thatis, of not being identified in the report in connectionwith any policy, procedure, or piece of information.Several respondents chose full anonymity. This ex-plains why some policies, procedures, and items ofinformation mentioned in the report are not associatedwith named jurisdictions.The project made extensive use of CDC aggregate dataon AIDS case reports. These data form the basis ofthe summary epidemiological profile of AIDS and theAIDS incidence rates for the population at large whichare presented in the report. Project staff interviewednumerous physicians, medical researchers, correctionaladministrators, public health officials, attorneys, andothers to gather information on key issues and options.Finally, project staff reviewed a great deal of scien-tific literature, educational material, correctional andpublic health procedures, and newspaper and magazinearticles. We made use of several automated databasesearches to ensure that we had identified all relevantliterature and articles.AIDS in Correctional Facilities: KeyIssues and Organization of the ReportThis section summarizes key facts and issues regardingAIDS in the correctional settingwith reference to thesubsequent chapters that will provide detaileddiscussions.The Problem of AIDSChapter One of this report summarizes the latestmedical information and research on AIDS. AIDS isa serious communicable disease that undermines thehuman body's ability to combat infections andmalignancies. In 1983 and 1984, the cause of AIDS xiiAIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESnow called human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)was discovered by scientists. Most cases it, he UnitedStates have been among homosexual men and in-travenous drug abusers, although heterosexualtransmission has been clearly documented and thenumber of heterosexually transmitted cases has grownat a more rapid rate than cases in other transmissioncategories.End-stage AIDS isafataldisease.However, there is a range of milder forms of illness,sometimes called AIDS-related complex (ARC), thatmay also appear among those infected with the AIDSvirus.Infection with HIV istransmitted through con-taminated blood, semen, and vaginal secretions,primarily during sexual intercourse and needle-sharingrelated to intravenous drug abuse. The virus is difficultto transmit and there is absolutely no evidence of itstransmission through any form of casual contact.In 1985, tests became available to detect the presenceof antibodies (evidence of the body's attempts to fightoff an infection) to HIV. However, the test does notdetect the presence of the virus itself and there con-tinues to be substantial debate surrounding the ap-propriate uses of the antibody tests and the accuracyof their results. While significant progress has beenmade in medical research on AIDS, there is still novaccine or generally effective therapy for HIV in-fection.Chapter Two presents the epidemiology of AIDS inthe correctional setting and the outside world. OnJanuary 4, 1988, the 50,000th case of AIDS wasreported in the United States. Cases are still concen-trated in large metropolitan areas on the east and westcoasts, but the distribution is less skewed than it wasin 1985. Responses to the NIJ survey reveal that, asof October 1987, there have been a cumulative totalof 1,320 contIrmed AIDS cases in thirty-nine state andfederal correctional systems. In addition, thirty-onelarge city and county jail systems reported a cumulativetotal of 644 cases of AIDS among inmates. Thus,survey responses from the United States reveal a totalof 1964 correctional AIDS cases. There have been acumulative total of fifteen AIDS cases reported amongCanadian inmates. There have been no job-relatedcases of HIV infection or AIDS among correctionalstaff.Inmate cases have increased by 156 percent since thefirst NIJ survey in 1985 and by 59 percent since thesecond survey in 1986. These are large increases, butthe 1986-87 increase is, in fact, slightly lower than thatin the American population as a whole over the sameperiod (61 percent). These figures represent cumulativetotal cases since the responding jurisdictions began keeping records. According to questionnaire responses,as of October 1987, there were 295 currentcases ofAIDS among state and federal inmates inthirty-ninesystems and 126 current cases among city and countyinmates in thirty-one systems. There were four casesin Canadian systems. The majority of correctionalAIDS cases are believed to be associated with in-travenous drug abuse. This association is particularlystrong in the Middle Atlantic region.The distribution of AIDS cases across correctionalsystems is quite uneven, although less so than two yearsago. More than 70 percent of state/federal prisonsystems and almost two-thirds of city/county systemshave had fewer than ten cases. At the other extreme,four state and federal systems (8 percent) have had 73percent of the cases in those systems and four of theresponding city and county systems (12 percent) had67 percent of the cases in those systems.AIDS incidence rates are higher in the correctionalsetting than in the population at large. This is almostcertainly due to the higher concentrations of high-riskgroup members (particular intravenous drug abusers)in inmate populations than in the population at large.There is substantial debate, but little hard data, on theextent to which the AIDS virus is being transmittedwithin correctional institutions. Data from severaljurisdictionssuggest low ratesof transmission.However, logic and common sense suggest that, evenin the best-managed correctional facilities, there maybe at least some transmission of the infection occur-ring among inmates.Key Issues in Developing CorrectionalPolicies and ProceduresPart Two of the report covers the following majorpolicy areas: Education and Training (Chapter Three);HIV Antibody Screening and Testing (Chapter Four);Medical, Psycho-Social, and Correctional Manage-ment Issues (Chapter Five), and Confidentiality, Legal,and Labor Relations Issues (Chapter Six', The follow-ingissuesaffect decisionmaking in all of these majorpolicy areas:The importance of education and training.Effective educational programs, which ad-dress identified concerns and present ra-tional and practical measures to minimizerisk, can dramatically reduce the fears ofinmates and staff and thereby influence awhole range of policy options regardinghousing, work assignments, and the dailyroutine of the correctional institution.The relative importance of medical andcorrectional considerations in reachingpolicy decisions.Administratorsmustdecide among sometimes conflicting advicebased on medical guidelines designed forthe outside community, on the one hand,and the special circumstances of the cor-rectional institution, on the other. Suchconflicts may affect decisions regardingtesting, housing, medical management, andprecautionary measures.The extent and nature of the correctionalsystem's responsibilities for preventing thetransmission of HIV infection and AIDS.This issue requires administrators to decidewhether their institutions should bearresponsibilities for disclosure of informa-tion and other precautionary measures thatare not practiced in the community at large.This, in turn, depends on deciding whetherthere is more intrinsic risk that the diseasewill be transmitted in the correctional set-ting than in other settings in the outsideworld.The inter-relatedness of many key AIDS-related policy decisions.Administratorsshould t..asider picture\" of AIDSpolicy, because each individual policy deci-sion (such as whether to conduct mass HIVantibody screening) may drive others (suchas housing for seropositives and notifica-tion/disclosure of inmates' antibody statuswhen paroled or released).Key Policy OptionsThis section summarizes the findings and recommen-dations of the chapters on key policy options. Thesesummaries are drawn from the concluding section ofeach chapter.Education and TraitigChapter Three discusses education and training onAIDS for correctional staff and inmates. Educationand training represent the keystone of the correctionalresponse to AIDS. Virtually all responding correctionalsystems are now providing some AIDS education toboth inmates and staff. Live training has become muchmore prevalent in the two years since the first NIJstudy. Education and training are particularlynecessary because of the persistence of misinforma-tion, as well as rational concerns, regarding AIDS. Oursurvey results show that staff and inmate concern Introduction and Summaryxiii aboutAIDShavenotdeclined significantly in the lastyear.Chapter Three discusses the following key elements ofAIDSeducation and training:AIDStraining should be timelyif possi-ble, it should be presented before wide-spread concern takes hold.AIDStraining should be regularlypresented and regularly updated to respondto changing information and the oftenmisleading media coverage of AIDS.Misinformed fear willreassertitselfwithout frequent doses of accurate medicalinformation.AIDStraining should be mandatory forinmates and staff. This will be expensiveand logistically challenging, but the costand trouble are justified because the topicis of such great importance.Correctional systems should involve in-mates and staff in the development ofAIDSeducational programs. This can bedone by soliciting particular questions andconcerns and using them as the basis of thetraining.AIDStraining should be live, so that in-mates have a chance to ask questions andreceive answers from knowledgeablespeakers.Live training should be supplemented withvideotapes and/or written informationalmaterials.Alleducational programs and materialsshould use simple non-technical languageunderstandable to the intended audience.Credibility is absolutely critical to the suc-cess ofAIDStraining. Systems can buildcredibility by using knowledgeable andapproachable trainers, ensuring that alltraining is factual and consistent, and byusing peer trainers who are able to developstrong rapport with audiences.AIDS education should avoid extremes ofalarmism and complacency. Itshouldneither advocate unnecessary and inap-propriate measures nor encourage a falsesense of security in any group. Rather,training should emphasize that everyonemust avoid certain well-defined behaviorsand exposures.xiv AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESAIDStraining should be keyed to thespecific concerns of a correctional au-dience. Strictly generic materials are insuf-ficient.AIDStraining content should focus onspecific risks and specific practical precau-tionary measures for inmates and staff. In-mate training should stress abstinence fromdrug use and sexual activity. However, asa realistic response, many correctionalsystems also include \"safer sex\" guidelinesand information on cleaning needles.All AIDStraining and materials distribu-tion should be documented in case offuture lawsuits. This may enable systemsto counter claims that insufficient trainingon risks and precautions was provided.AIDStraining and education should beperiodically evaluated so it can be updated\"nd improved.H1 Antibody Screening and TestingChapter Four discusses the major applications of HIVantibody testing in the correctional setting and theperceived advantages and disadvantages of the rangeof testing options open to correctional administrators.The most controversial testing application is massscreening of inmates in the absence of clinical indica-tions. In the correctional setting, we define massscreening as the mandatory testing of all inmates orall new inmates. ,...There are a variety of possible applications for the an-tibody test besides mandatory mass screening. Theseinclude screening inmates with discernible histories ofhigh-risk behavior testing in response to incidents inwhich transmission of the virus may have occurred,voluntary testing, testing on request, and testing in sup-port of epidemiological studies. Finally, correctionalsystems rarely become involved in staff testing, exceptperhaps in response to possible transmission incidents.Twelve state correctional systems have implementedor are planning to implement mass screening programsfor inmates; no city or county systems have institutedor planned such programs for inmates. The FederalBureau of Prisons tests all inmates on release and a10 percent random sample of incoming inmates.However, almost all of the jurisdictions respondingto the survey do employ testing for more limitedpurposes, such as when clinically indicated or whenrequested. .15 WNW The issue of mass screening for antibodies to HIV incorrectional institutions has sparked an intense debate,involving the following major questions:Are HIV Antibody Tests Reliable andAccurate?Proponents of mass screening argue thatthe available tests are highly reliable andaccurate, with very few false positive andnegative results.Opponents point out that there continue tobe serious concerns about the number offalse positives and false negatives.Can Mass Screening Prevent Transmissionof HIV?Proponents argue that mass screeningfacilitates policies that will reduce transmis-sion of HIV in correctional facilities.Opponents reply that it is better to focusprevention and classification strz\".lies oninmates likely to be predatory or otherwiseprone to high-risk behaviors, rather thantrying to identify all infected inmates,many of whom may not pose behavioralproblems.Will Mass Screening Improve MedicalMonitoring and Care?Proponents suggest thatidentifyingseropositives will facilitate timely medicalmanagement.Opponents argue that it is unfair to sub-ject seropositives to inevitable stigma whenthere is no cure available, and that thereare reasonable alternatives for the proac-tive identification of inmates at high riskfor HIV infection.Is it Possible to Maintain the Confidentiali-ty of Antibody Test Results in CorrectionalFacilities and How Does Disclosure ofResults Affect Seropositive Inmates?Proponents of mass screening argue thatconfidentiality can be maintained.Opponents argue that confidentiality ofsuch sensitive information is impossible tomaintain in a correctional setting, and thatdisclosure of test results will inevitably leadto ostracism and serious discrimination.What are the Legal Implications of MassScreening?Proponents argue that mass screening islegal and proper and that failure to iden-tify potentially infectious inmates couldraise serious liability problems for the cor-rectional system.Opponents argue that mass screening isillegal in many jurisdictions and that anylegal liabilities could be effectively ad-dressed by better procedures for the pre-vention of sexual victimization.How Costly are Mass Screening Programs?Proponents argue that s stems can imple-ment screening quite monomically.Opponents respond that costs may be veryhigh, particularly when periodic follow-uptesting of seronegatives and separate hous-ing and programming for seropositives areconsidered.Will Mass Screening Support or Under-mine the Effects of Education and Preven-tion Programs?Proponents of mass screening argue thatpotentially infectious inmates must be iden-tified so that they may be targetted ineducation and prevention programs.Critics respond that;Itchdifferentialeducation and prevention programsneedlessly stigmatize one group of inmateswhile perhaps lulling the others into a falsesense of security. In fact, everyone shouldreceive the same educational messagesregarding high-risk behaviors.Will Mass Screening Allay or Inflame theFears of Inmates, Staff, and the Public?Proponents suggest that mass screeningcould help to calm the concerns of inmates,staff, and the public.Critics contend that mass screening willneedlessly inflame fears, particularly ifseropositivity rates are found to be high.Is Mass Screening the Best Way to Assessthe Extent of the AIDS Problem in anInmate Population?Proponents argue that mass screening is thebest way to determine the scope of theproblem.Critics reply that the same information canbe obtained from blind epidemiologicalstudies.a0Introduction and Summary xv Should Correctional Systems be TakingSteps Not Taken in Society at Large?Proponents contend that presumed highrates of infection with and transmission ofHIV in correctional facilities justify themandatory mass screening of inmates.Critics respond that infection rates are lowin many correctional populations and thatavailable evidence also suggests low ratesof HIV transmission among inmates.Decisions about whether or not to institute massscreening should be based on careful consideration ofthese issues, rather than on thesolitical pressure thathas arisen on the subject.Medical, Psycho-Social, and CorrectionalManagement IssuesChapter Five discusses four key areas of policy:medical management, counseling and psycho-socialservices, housing policy, and precautionary measures.Major findings and recommendations include thefollowing:Quality medical care should be provided toall inmates infected with HIV. AIDS pa-tients,I particular, need humane and sup-portive care and access to AZT and othertherapeutic drugs as indicated.Emphasis should be placed on proactiveidentification and monitoring of inmates athigh risk of HIV infection and AIDS. Thisshould be done through comprehensive in-take screening and regular follow-up.Comprehensive psycho-social services andpre-release planning are also essential forinmates with asymptomatic HIV infection,ARC, and AIDS. This must include pre-and post-test counseling and guidance onresponsible behavior to avoid the infectionof others.Costs of care for inmates with AIDS arevery high, but may be reduced by elimi-nating unnecessary hospitalizations. At thesame time, such reductions may be coun-terbalanced by the high cost of AZT, whichis becoming a major correctional costconcern.Most correctional systems still segregate orhospitalize inmates with AIDS, but therehas been a noticeable trend away from xviAIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESblanket segregation of asymptomaticseropositives and inmates with ARC.Systems should consider case-by-case hous-ing and programming decisions based onthe inmate's medical situation, need forprotection, and likelihood of engaging inbehaviors that may place others at risk.Correctional systems should establish\"universal precautions\" for blood and bodyfluids. That is, unprotected contact withthe blood or body fluids of everyoneshould be avoided.Reasonable and consistent precautionaryprocedures should be established to helpstaff safely deal with a variety of situations,including altercations, blood spills, search-es, CPR, and biting incidents.Correctional systems should not adoptprecautionary measures beyond thoserecommended by CDC for clinical staff.Several correctional systems currentlymake condoms available to inmates in in-stitutions, emphasizing that this is not tocondone prohibited behavior but only torecognize that it occurs and to provide forreasonable risk reduction. Other correc-tional systems may wish to assess this ex-perience in reaching their own policydecisions.Confidentiality, Legal, and LaborRelation IssuesChapter Six discusses the difficult issues surroundingconfidentiality and disclosure of AIDS-related medicalinformation in the correctional setting, as well as thekey legal and legislative developments regarding AIDSin corrections Among the findings are the following:Realistically, it is difficult to maintain theconfidentiality of sensitive AIDS-related in-formation in prisons and jails; however,because of the potentially serious conse-quences of unauthorized disclosure, it isessential that correctional authorities makethe strongest possible efforts to preserveconfidentiality. In many jurisdictions, con-fidentiality of AIDS-related information isspecifically required by law.No disclosures should be made exceptwhere clearly required by medical, safety,or institutional security considerations. Policies should be adopted and enforcedwhich specify clearly who is permitted toreceive informatics:, v:hat information is tobe disclosed, and under what circum-stances. Vague policies permitting dis-closure to those with a \"need to know\" areinsufficient.In conformance with recent CDC guide-lines, correctional medical staff shouldstrongly counsel persons infected with HIVto inform their sex partners; if an in-dividual refuses to notify his or her part-ners, then correctiona' medical staff shouldcarry out the notification in a confidentialmanner.Since 1985, there has been a great increasein litigation related to AIDS in correctionalfacilities. This has focused on the follow-ing areas, among others:1. challenges to segregation and conditionsof confinement;2. quality of medical care;3. attempts to mandate mass screening ofinmates for antibodies to HIV andsegregation of seropositives;4. confidentiality and disclosure of medicalinformation.Most disposed cases on these issues havebeen decided in favor of correctionalsystems, on the grounds that their policieswere in furtherance of legitimate medical,correctional management, or institutionalsecurity objectives. However, many casesremain pending.The legality of mandatory testing inresponse to potential transmission incidentsremains unclear; it is clearly prohibited inmany jurisdictions under current law, butmany judges believe that they can issuecourt orders to require such testing in cer-tain instances. laMany correctional systems are worriedabout their potential liability for HIV in-fections which occur among inmates whileincarcerated and among staff while on thejob. There are serious difficulties in link-ing infection with a particular episode;however, correctional systems can prob-ably eliminate any potent;91 liability, andmaximize safety in their institutions, bypreventing inmates from being victimizedand providing all inmates and staff withclear and complete training on how toavoid becoming infected with HIV.The most important AIDS-related laborrelations issueis whether correctionalemployees should or may be excused fromtheir duties out of fear of AIDS. Correc-tional and other law enforcement agencieshave been clear on this issue: such refusalsare unjustified and will result in disci-plinary action.As yet, there have been no AIDS-relatedemployment cases brought by correctionalstaff under federal rehabilitation laws.However, correctional agencies shouldkeep abreast of the caselaw which stronglysuggests that action against employees withAIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection onthe basis of their medical condition is im-permissible, unless directly tied to theirability to perform the job.There has been a great deal of legislativeactivity regarding AIDS in corrections dur-ing the last year. Most legislative proposalshave called for mandatory HIV antibodyscreening of inmates and segregation ofseropositives. While several more limitedtesting bills have passed, none of the man-datory mass screening proposals havebecome law. Introduction and Summary xvii Part One The Problem of AIDS Chapter 1: Essential Medical Information Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is aserious communicable disease that undermines thehuman body's immune system. It makes the individualsusceptible to a range of \"opportunistic\" infections,malignancies, and other diseases which would notgenerally be life-threatening to persons with normallyfunctioning immune systems. AIDS also directlycauses dementia and other disorders of the centralnervous system. While the overall incidence of AIDSin the American population is still relatively small (8.6cases per 100,000 population in 19871), the diseasenonetheless represents a very serious public health pro-blem. This is primarily because of the high mortalityrate, the continued lack of a vaccine or cure for thedisease, the potentially very large number of infected(and infectious) individuals, the uncertain but oftenprolonged incubation period, and the uncertainty asto what propeition of infected persons will developAIDS-related symptoms or the end-stage disease itself.AIDS was first recognized in the United States in 1981,although it may actually have appeared in this coun-try as early as 1969. The disease was identified throughstudies of several groups of previously healthy gay menwho developed an unusual form of pneumoniaPneumocystis carinii pneumonia) and a rare form ofcancer (Kaposi's sarcoma). In the absence of othercauses, the appearance of these diseases save evidenceof an underlying immunodeficiency in the patients.AIDS has a very poor prognosis: 85 percent of patientswhose cases were reported at least four years ago havedied. Although periods of survival vary considerably,no one has ever recovered from the disease. Researchis proceeding on many fronts and has provided somepromising results, but there is still no effective vac-cine or cure for AIDS. The statements that have beenmade by scientists and researchers since the beginn-ing of the epidemic remain just as true today: \"our onlyweapons against AIDS are education and behavioralchange.\" This prescription is equally applicable to thecorrectional setting and the society at large. Indeed,this report will stress that education and training mustbe the cornerstone of the correctional response toAIDS.The Cause of AIDS:Human Immunodeficiency VirusIn 1983 and 1984, scientists at the Institute Pasteur inParis and the National Institutes of Health identifiedand isolated the cause of AIDS: a virus first calledlymphadenopathy-associated virus (LAV), or HumanT-Cell lymphotropic virus Type III (HTLV-III), andnow generally known as Human ImmunodeficiencyVirus (HIV). HIV is a \"retrovirus,\" a type of infec-tious agent that had previously been identified as caus-ing many animal diseases. The designation \"retrovirus\"derives from the backward, or \"retro-\", flow of geneticinformation from RNA to DNA, which reverses thenormal flow of genetic messages.2While it is now universally believed that HIV is anindispensable requirement for the development ofAIDS, there is still a great deal of research being doneon \"co-factors\" that may render some individuals moresusceptible to infection and HIV-related illness thanothers. Possible cofactors include genetic factors, otherinfections such as hepatitis-B, alcohol or drug use,and malnutritibn.3HIV infects and destroys certain white blood cells (T4cells), thereby undermining that part of the body's im-mune system which normally combats infections andmalignancies. One can be infected with HIV for years,possibly even indefinitely, without ever developingsymptoms. However, asymptomatic (as well as symp-tomatic) persons can transmit the infection.HIV Antibody Tests and TheirApplicationsIn early 1985, a commercial test for antibodies to HIVbecame available. The basic test is an enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA or EIA), a methodwhich is used for other purposes besides detection ofantibodies to HIV. (However, for convenience, werefer hereafter to the basic HIV antibody test as theELISA test.) It is not a test for AIDS, nor does it evendetect the presence of the virus itself only thepresence of antibodies to the virus. Antibodies areevidence, present in the blood, of the immune system'sattempt to fight off an infection.Actual culturing of the virus (i.e., growing the virusfrom a specimen of body fluid or tissue) is very dif-ficult and expensive and is currently performed in onlya few research laboratories. Other blood tests for thevirus (e.g., T-cell tests) are also difficult and expensive.However, at this writing, new techniques for detectingHIV P,Itigen (part of the virus itself, as opposed toantioodies to the virus) are undergoing clinical trials Essential Medical Information 3 and may be available quite soon. A principal advan-tage of the antigen test is that it will be positive im-mediately upon infection, whereas the antibody testswill be falsely negative during the period betweeninfection and appearance of antibodies. This periodis generally thought to be between three and twelveweeks, although some recent data indicate that the lag-time may sometimes be significantly longer.4The ELISA test was developed to screen the bloodsupply, and it has been very effective for that purpose.The nation's blood supply is now considered safe.Several recent reports indicate that a small number ofinfected units of blood may have slipped throughundetected, because the donor was only recently in-fected and antibodies had not had time to appear bythe time the blood was donated. However, the Centersfor Disease Control (CDC) estimates that only about100 transfusion-associated infections will occur an-nually out of a total of sixteen million units transfused.The National Academy of Sciences report on AIDSestimates the risk of transfusion-associated infectionat fewer than one in 34,000 recipients of packed redblood cells.5HIV antibody tests are now being used to screen peo-ple rather than blood, as well as to complementdiagnostic procedures. The first widely publicizedapplication of the HIV antibody test to screen peoplewas the Defense Departm ;nes screening of all recruitapplicants for the armed forces. The government hasalso instituted screening of all active-duty and reservemilitary personnel. In the Spring of 1987, the Presi-dent recommended that all prison inmates and poten-tial immigrants be screened as well. Soon after, theAttorney General ordered the Federal Bureau ofPrisons to begin testing all new inmates and all inmatesabout to be released. A number of other correctionalsystems have followed suit. However, as discussed inChapter Four, there continues to be substantial con-troversy surrounding the accuracy of the tests and theirapplication to screening and diagnosis of individuals.Screening of donated blood and blood products isbased on a single ELISA test. Units of blood testingpositive are discarded. However, when people arebeing tested,careful confirmation of results isnecessary. The ELISA test may produce a significantnumber of false positives, particularly in populationswhere the true prevalence of infection islow.Therefore, the CDC strongly recommends that initiallypositive specimens be subjected to a second ELISA testand that a more accurate test typically the WesternBlot test be used to confirm the ELISA result.6 Aswill be discussed in Chapter Four, however, there 4 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIEScontinue to be concerns regarding the number of falsepositives even when Western Blot confirmation isperformed.A properly confirmed result on th HIV antibody testmeans that an individual was infected at some timein the past. However, the test cannot pinpoint the dateof infection. Notably, a negative result on the HIV an-tibody test means only that the individual had not beeninfected with HIV (or had been infected but had notdeveloped antibodies) as of the time Lhe blood samplewas taken. It says nothing about the likelihood offuture infection or susceptibility tc infection. Indeed,this is one of the key messages to present in post-testcounseling of seronegative persons. Individuals whohave engaged, and are continuing to engage, in high-risk behaviors should be told that their negative resultrepresents \"pure luck\" and that the on,y ways to reducetheir likelihood of becoming infecteu in the future areto discontinue these behaviors immeiiately or, at least,to begin taking appropriate precautionary measures.?DefinitionsAIDS is not a single disease: in ieed, there is a spec-trum of possible reactions to HT V, from no symptomsto \"end-stage\" AIDS. Terms have been given to scmebasic degrees of reaction along this spectrum: asymp-tomatic HIV infection; AIDS-Related Complex(ARC); and end-stage AIM. However, there are varia-tions in the definitions of these terms and, in fact,some researchers and physicians have defined alter-native points along the spectrum of illness. Moreover,according to the National Academy of Sciences, thepoints along the spectrum \"cannot be consideredsimply as stages of an orderly progression in the spec-trum of HIV infection. \"8 For those individuals whodo pass through these conditions sequentially, thereis no standard rate or pace of progression. Somepatients remain asymptomatic for long periodsperhaps indefinitely while others quickly developend-stage AIDS and die. What causes these wide varia-tions in clinical history is not known. However, a basicunderstanding of the complexities and variations ofthe definitions is a prerequisite for understanding theepidemiology of AIDS. The following categories arethe most important and widely used.AIDS (\"end-stage\")HIV infection has no independent symptoms excepta form of dementia (HIV encephalopathy) similar tothat found in Alzheimer's Disease. Otherwise an AIDSdiagnosis is based on the presence of \"indicatordiseases\" found in individuals whose immune systems2j are compromised, but not generally seen in individualswith normal immune systems. The two most commonindicator diseases continue to be Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma. The CDC\"surveillance definition\" of the definitionused for enumeration and epidemiological analysis ofAIDS cases in the United States) has been revisedseveral times since first being issued in 1981.9 The mostrecent CDC definition, issued in August 1987, isincluded in Appendix B. It makes three basic changesin the diagnosis of AIDS. First, it adds as AIDSindicator diseases some \"progressive, seriously dis-abling, and even fatal conditions\" that are neitherinfections nor cancers and were thus omitted fromprevious definitions. These conditions include AIDSdementia and HIV \"wasting syndrome,\" which ischaracterized by significant, involuntary weight lossplus either 1) chronic diarrhea or 2) chronic weaknessand persistent fever. These symptoms of HIV wastingsyndrome must be unexplainable by reference to anyother illnesses. Patients definitively diagnosed (i.e.,with laboratory confirmation) with any one from thisexpanded list of indicator diseases and with laboratoryevidence of HIV infection (typically, a properly con-firmed positive antibody test sequence) are to be con-sidered AIDS cases. In 1. articular, the inclusion of HIVwasting syndrome as an indicator disease for AIDSmay move a significant number of patients previous-ly considered to display AIDS-Related Complex(ARC) into the category of end-stage AIDS.Second, according to the new definition, the presenceof any one of this expanded list of definitively diag-nosed indicator diseases in a patient with laboratoryevidence of HIV infection now indicates a diagnosisof AIDS, regardless of the presence of other causesof immunodeficiency. Previously, such other causesof immunodeficiency disqualified a case from an AIDSdiagnosis.Third, the new definition specifies that patients inwhich certain indicator diseases (e.g., Pnewnocystiscarinii pneumonia and Kaposi's sarcoma) have been\"presumptively\" diagnosed (i.e., without the laboratoryconfirmation previously required) should be diagnos-ed as AIDS cases in the presence of laboratory evidenceof HIV infection.In short, these changes have significantly expanded thesurveillance definition of AIDS. Ultimately, they areexpected to add 10-20 percent to the total number ofAIDS cases. This definitional expansion became ef-fective September 1, 1987. As of December 28, 1987it had resulted in 2,700 additional cases, 13 percentof the AIDS cases reported to CDC since January 1,1987.10AIDS-Related Complex (ARC)The designation \"AIDS-Related Complex\" (ARC) hasnever been officially recognized, but is still widelyused. A diagnosis of ARC is based on the presence ofa combination of conditions, often quite mild, thattogether give evidence of infection with the AIDSvirus. The symptoms of ARC may subside, but the in-dividual remains infected. The most commonly useddefinition of ARC is from the National Institutes ofHealth: any two from a long list of symptoms in-cluding swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, and nightsweats, plus any two from a list of laboratory abnor-malities, including blood test results showing depressedhelper T-cells and depressed helper/suppressor ratio.(The complete NIH definition is also included inAppendix B.) As discussed above, the new CDCsurveillance definition of AIDS effectively incor-porates some patients previously considered to haveARC. However, many other individuals with symp-toms of HIV infection (such as those with night sweatsor persistent generalized lyr.,,hademcpathy [PGL]swollen lymph nodes) still do not qualify as AIDS casesand thus should be considered to have ARC.Asymptomatic HIV InfectionMany individuals (perhaps as many as 1.5 million inthe United States) are infected with HIV but have notdeveloped any symptoms of disease. Asymptomaticinfection is identified by antibody testing. The CDCrecommends that all confirmed seropositive individuals(i.e., those with a confirmed positive HIV antibodytest sequence) be considered infected, although, stricilyspeaking, the test results only show that the individualhas been infected with the AIDS virus at some timein the past.Seropositive individuals may never develop any symp-toms, let alone develop end-stage AIDS. However,they are capable of transmitting the infection to others,even if they never develop symptoms themselves.The Relationships Among Exposure,Infection, HIV Seropositivity, andDevelopment of ARC or AIDSiFigure 1.1 summarizes the meanings of exposure,infection, seropositivity, ARC, and AIDS and the rela-tionships among these stages. \"Exposure\" to HIVmeans that the individual has had contact wi'di the Essential Medical Information 5 StageExposure Infection Seropositivity ARC AIDSFigure 1.1RELATIONSHIPS AMONG EXPOSURE, INFECTION, HIVSEROPOSITIVITY, ARC, AND AIDS MeaningIndividual has contact withHIV in a way that makes transmissionpossible (e.g., sexual contact orneedle-sharing activity)Individual is infected withHIV. Infection is assumedto be permanent.Individual has antibodies toHIV, meaning that infectionhas occurred at some timein the past. Antibody testscannot pinpoint date of infection.It usually takes 3-12 weeksfrom the time of infectionfor the antibodies to appear,although significantlylonger have been reported.Presence a combinationof evidence of symptomaticinfection with HIV.(Note: New CDC AIDS incorporates manyindividuals previously classifiedas ARC toPrevious Unknown, although multipleexposures probably in-crease the risk of infection.CDC considers double ELISAtest confirmed with aWestern Blot to be anaccurate indicator of infectionstatus; however, there continuesto be concern about false positives,particularly in populations witha low prevalence of infection(See Chapter Four). National Academy of Sciencesestimates that 90% of seropositiveindividuals show someimmunodeficiency within 5 years. It is generally believedthat at least one-half ofseropositive individuals andindividuals with ARC will developAIDS. However, all estimates areuncertain due to the lengthyincubation period. virus in a way that would make it possible for him orher to become infected (e.g., sexual contact or needle-shai ing activity). It is not known exactly what frac-tion of exposed persons will become infected andremain infected. However, research on a cohort of sex-ually active homosexual males in San Francisco revealsvery high rates of seroconversion (i.e., becoming HIVseropositive over time), indicating that multiple ex-posure increases the risk of infection. A representativesample of the cdaort was 4 percent seropositive whentheir blood samples (collected in 1978) were first tested.By 1985, the seropositive rate in the sample had in-creased to an w,tounding 73 percent. Seroconversionin homosexual!, and been repeatedlylinked to number of sexual partners.11HIV seropos1.tivity means that an individual was in-fected at some time in the past, although the antibodytests cannot pinpoint the date of infection. Thus, the 6AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESview commonly presented in articles regarding AIDS(as well as in some correctional departments' educa-tional materials and policy statements) that HIVseropositivity merely indicates possible \"exposure\" tothe virusis considered by many physicians andepidemiologists to be a serious misunderstanding. In-deed, CDC's current position is that, for the purposesof counseling and making public health recommenda-tions, any seropositivc person should be consideredinfected and potentially infectious. The longpossiblyindefinite incubation period of AIDS makes sero-positivity a very serious problem because it is neverpossible for a seropositive individual to know for cer-tain that he or she is free from risk of becoming illor infecting others.Itis now generally believed that a majority ofseropositive persons will develop ARC and/or AIDS.Estimates have continued to increase with the passage 2 ,3 of more time to track infected individuals in cohortstudies. The National Academy of Sciences estimatesthat 25-50 percent of HIV seropositives will developAIDS within five-ten years of infection. The reportalso notes that more than 90 percent of seropositiveindividuals show some immune system deficiencywithin five years of seroconversion.12 Many physiciansnow believe that all individuals infected with HIV willultimately become ill unless an effective therapeuticintervention is introduced.Research findings are be\"ginning to suggest the quan-titative relationships among seropositivity, infection,and the development of illness. However, among themost puzzling questions about AIDS remain the deter-minants of actual infection among those personsexposed to the virus and the determinants of develop-ing symptoms or becoming ill among those personswho are infected. Intensive research continues to bedevoted to \"co-factors\" of infection and the mechanicsof i..iection. Possible co-factors under investigationinclude genetic characteristics, environmental charac-teristics, malnutrition, history of sexually-transmitteddiseases and/or drug and alcohol use which mayweaken the immune system, and the use of nitrateinhalants (\"poppers\").13 Mechanical issues include theinoculum size (amount of virus) and the number ofdoses required to transmit infection. Although theminimum dose of virus necessary to cause infectionis still unknown, there appears to be a developing con-sensus that a large inoculum given intravenously (suchas in a blood transfusion) poses an extremely high risk,while a single small inoculum given parenterally (i.e.,through the skin; as in an accidental needlestick) posesa very low risk of infection. At the same time, repeatedexposures to small doses (through repeated sexualcontact or sharing of contaminated needles) ultimatelypresent a grave risk of infection.14 Thus, the prob-ability of infection is based on the interaction of anumber of variables, including:inoculum size per exposure;virulence of the viral strain to which ex-posed (there may be different strains ofHIV with differing levels of virulence);number of exposures; andco-factors of infection present.On the other hand, some still subscribe to what Dr.Charles Rabkin, a New York City Health Departmentepidemiologist, terms \"the Russian-roulette theory\":that development of HIV infection is almost purelya matter of chance; a person who engages in sexualintercourse with an infected person or shares a con-taminated needle has a small chance, each time, ofbecoming infected.16 Under this theory, of course, thecumulative risk of infection increases as the numberof potential exposures increases.While these observations refer specifically to the rela-tionship between exposure and infection, similarhypotheses have been advanced regarding the relation-ship between infection and development of ARC orAIDS. In particular, it has been suggested that con-tinued exposures subsequent to initial infection mayincrease the chances that symptoms will develop.Incubation Period of AIDSAs more information is gathered and analyzed on thenatural history of AIDS, the more it appears that inmost cases the progression from asymptomatic infec-tion to end-stage AIDS occurs very slowly. Althoughin some cases the progress to AIDS is very rapid, theincubation period is usually two and one-half to fiveyears or more. Indeed, some researchers believe thatthere may be no real maximum incubation periodthat is, an infected person may develop symptoms atany time during his or her life. Because of the painfuluncertainties and anxieties involved, this is one of themost troubling aspects of the disease.The often lengthy incubation period of the disease alsoposes problems for epidemiologic analysis. The pat-terns of actual disease appearing now reflect the pat-terns of infection that were occurring several years ago;they do not necessarily reflect what the patterns of thedisease will be several years from now.Survival with AIDSAIDS is a fatal disease. Overall, 57 percent of personsdiagnosed with AIDS have died. However, amongcases diagnosed in 1981,the fatality rate is over 90per- cent, and over80percent among cases diagnosed in1984.16 A recent ,tudy of almost 6,000 New York City AIDS cases diagnosed before 1986found a medianlength of survival of just under one year from timeof diagnosis anc, a 15 percent cumulative probabilitycarviving five years. However, survival, particularlyin tiie first year after diagnosis, varied considerablyaccording to primary indicator disease, demographiccharacteristics, and transmission category. The mediansurvival foi patients with Kaposi's sarcoma only was750 days, while for those with Pneumocystis cariniipneumonia it was only 318days. (Earlier diagnosis andimproving application of existing clinical regimens,however, now appear to be increasing at least theshort-term survival among patients with Pneumocystis Essential Medical Information 7 carinii pneumonia.)') Other factors in combinationwith indicator disease also influenced survival. Forexample, black female intravenous drug abusers withPnewnocystis carinii pneumonia had a much shortermean survival period than white gay males 30-34 yearsold presenting with Kaposi's sarcoma only, and nohistory of intravenous drug use. Patients who wereboth homosexual and intravenous drug users hadpoorer prognoses than those with only one of theserisk factors.Transmission of HIV InfectionOne of the most serious problems affecting the publicresponse to AIDS has been the great amount of misin-formation and unfounded rumor about how the in-fectionistransmitted. There have been highlypublicized cases of parents refusing to send theirchildren to school with children who have AIDS orto permit their children to use swimming pools whichhad been used by persons with AIDS, and of officeworkers refusing to work with persons who haveAIDS. Public opinionpollsreveal continuedwidespread belief that HIV infection can be transmit-ted through casual contact in normal social settings.In the summer of 1987, the United States PublicHealth Service's Weekly National Health InterviewSurvey found that 47 percent of respondents believedHIV transmission was likely through shared utensils,31 perccnt thought transmission was likely throughpublic toilets, 25 percent believed that one could beinfected through donating blood, and 21 perccntthought they could be infected by co-workers in nor-mal workplace interaction.* Inmates and staff ofcorrectional institutions have not been exempt fromsuch misinformed fears. This section summarizesmedical knowledge on how HIV infection is and is nottransmitted.Known Means of Transmission: SexualContact, Iriuculation of Blood, andPerinatal EventsThere is extremely reliable information on the meansof transmission of HIV infection and AIDS. The ma-jor routes of transmission have been firmly establishedsince early in the epidemic. Skeptics often complainthat \"we can't really be sure\" about how the virus istransmitted, since \"new information comes out everyday.\" It is true that there is a steady stream of newinformation on many aspects of AIDS for example,on vaccines and therapeutic drugs, the proportion ofinfected persons who will develop symptoms, andpossible co-factors of infection and disease. Informa- 8 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIEStion on these subjects has, and will continue, tochange. However, there has been no new informationon means of transmission since 1981 or 1982. Theprimary means of transmission, as shown in Figure1.2, are the following:1. sexual intercourse;2. infusion or inoculation of blood; and3. perinatal events.*With the exception of one case apparently transmit-ted to an infant through breast milk and a smallnumber of cases lost to followup for various reasons,ali known casts of AIDS and HIV infection are at-tributed to one of the three means of transmissionlisted above. Figure 1.3 presents more detailed infor-mation on the precise types of contact included undereach of these three means of transmission and therelative risk of infection through such contacts.Almost 50,000 casts into tht epidemic, it is absolutelyclear that the overwhelming majority are attributableto contact with blood, semen, or vaginal secretions insexual relations or with blood in needle-sharing ac-tivities.

However, Hepatitis-B is transmittedmore efficiently than HIV infe...ion.20 Therefore,infection control measures (such as precautions regard-ing contact with blood and other body fluids) design,to prevent transmission of HepatitisB are more thansufficient. Indeed, CDC recommends that theseprecautions be used to prevent infection. Moreextreme measures than those ..,ommended forHepatitis-B are unnecessary and inappropriate forpreventing transmission of HIV infection.Sexual TransmissionIt is clear that HIV can be transmitted through male-to-male homosexual contact and through heterosex-ual contact, both male-to-female and female-to-male.As with any sexually-transmitted disease, the risk ofinfection with HIV increases as the number of poten-tial exposures increases. Thus, those who are extremelyactive sexually, with numerous partners and especiallywith partners not previously well-known to them, are almost certainly at higher risk. This applies toheterosexuals as weal as to homosexuals and bisexuals.There is strong evidence that anal intercourse (es-pecially for the receptive, as opposed to the insertive,partner) and other practices that may involve traumaor bleeding are especially risky. However, the risk oftransmission involved in vaginal intercourse and other 2,3Essential Medical Information 9 Figure 1.3RISK OF INFECTION THROUGH SPECIFIC MEANS OF HIV TRANSMISSION(continued) Body FluidsShown to HaveTransmitted HIVWhet: Exposure)Frequency TransmissionThrough This Means(Data on AIDS cases 28, 1987) BloodMucous Mem-brane (eye,mouth, nose)Accidental splashes 1 HIV infection worker not followiCDC-recommended precautions,0 intercourse of adult AIDS cases f Breast MilkMucousMembraneIngestion 1 case of HIV infection of sexual activity should not be minimized. CDCemphasizes that any unprotected sexual activity involv-ing exchange of body fluids should be avoided wheneither partner is known or suspected to be infected.Condoms are considered generally effective, but notabsolutely foolproof, in preventing transmission.Disagreement continues on the current and projectedscale of heterosexual transmission of HIV. it is truethat the percentage of AIDS cases attributed toheterosexual contact remains small about 4 percent.However, this percentage has increased from 2 per-cent in 1984, and the number of heterosexual cases hasincreased more rapidly than the numbers in othertransmission categories. 10 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESImportant evidence of heterosexual transmissioncomes from studies of heterosexual couples andmilitary recruits in the United States and also crom theAfrican experience. Studies of stable, long-termmonogamous heterosexual couples reveal that 7 to 68percent of the steady sexual partners of HIV-infectedindividuals themselves become infected within a fewyears.21The sex distribution of African AIDS cases is nearlyequal, in contrast to the male-dominated epidemiologyseen in the United States. It should be noted, however,that African cultural factors might strongly inhibit thereporting of homosexual experiences, thus possiblyexaggerating the apparent extent of heterosexual27 Figure 1.3RISK OF INFECTION THROUGH SPECIFIC MEANS OF HIV TkANSMISSION(continued)NOTES aCDC, AIDS Weekly Surveillance Report, December 28, 1987. Range results from uncertainty as to the relative proportions of the cases in the category \"Homosexual Male and IV Drug Abusers\" attributable to homosexual contact and to needle sharing.bAn additional 194 AIDS cases were in women born in countries where heterosexual transmission is believed to play a major role.c.Friedland, G.H. and R.S.

In any case, sexual activity seems likelyto be the predominant means of transmission inAfrica, since almost all African cases are in the sex-ually active age range. Non-sexual modes of transmis-sion, such as the use of unsterile needles in medicalpractice and transfusion with infected blood, are quitecommon in some African countries. However, if theyrepresented the predominant mode of transmission,they would presumably have produced many morecases than have been identified among persons in non-sexually-active age groups. African studies also sug-gest that prostitutes are often carriers of HIV.22The prevalence of other sexually-transmitted dis-easesparticularly those involving genital lesionswhich might provide a route of entry for the virusmay also be an important factor in heterosexualtransmission of HIV infection in Africa. These diseasesare not as prevalent in the United States. In general,it is sometimes argued that many of the factors im-portant in African heterosexual transmission are ab-sent in the United States. However, studies ofAmerican military recruits clearly establish thatheterosexual transmission is occurring in this country.Studies of American military recruits discovered amale-to-female ratio among HIV seropositives of 2.7to 1 nationally, and 1.2 to 1 in the six counties withthe highest seropositivity rates in the population as awhole. The national average male-to-female ratio ofAIDS cases is thirteen to one. The studies also iden-tified numerous married couples in which both part-ners were seropositive.23 The recruit data mayexaggerate heterosexual transmission, since certainmale risk groups gay men and hemophiliacsaredefer :ed from military service, and some of the infec-tion reported in women may really have resulted fromIV drug use. Thus, the data must be interpreted verycautiously. However, they strongly suggest thatheterosexual transmission may have already becomeestablished in the young adult population in certainareas of the country, even though this type of transmis-sion is not yet that prominent in statistics on AIDScases. This, in turn, serves to underline the key pointthat the past and current epidemiological profile ofAIDS cases may not accurately predict tin futurecourse of the epidemic.The six counties which reveal the highest Gverallinfection rates, as well as the 1.2 to 1, virtually even,male-to-female ratio among HIV seropositive recruitsare also those where HIV infection isstronglyassociated with intravenous drug abuse. This providesstrong evidence for the link already noted by manyobservers between heterosexual transmission of HIVand intravenous drug abuse. A large percentage of thepersons infected thus far through heterosexual contact Essential Medical Information 11 are the sexual partners of intravenous drug users. Mostof these are minority women from the New York Citymetropolitan area and South Florida. A smallerpercentage are sexual partners of bisexual men. Inshort, most heterosexual transmission thus far appearsto involve direct contact with a member of one of thecurrently predominant risk groups. Although it isunclear what the future holds, it appears that, at leastat present, there is not a significant amount of \"ter-tiary\" heterosexual transmission that is, resultingfrom contact between heterosexuals, neither of whomare in well-established risk groups occurring in theUnited States. This is one of the major argumentsadvanced against the \"break-out\" of HIV infection intothe non-intravenous-drug-using heterosexual popula-tion.24 Even if this is true, however, heterosexualtransmission must be of concern to correctionaladministratorsparticularly with regard to pre-releaseeducationbecause intravenous drug users are over-represented among inmate populations.Another argument against the \"breakout\" of heterosex-ual transmission is the estimated low probability oftransmission through a single sexual encounter.25 Ifthe probability that any potential heterosexual part-ner is infected is very lowas it probably is at presentin the non-intravenous-drug using population thenthe risk associated with casual heterosexual activitymay be much lower than that associated with casualhomosexual activity (where the probability that anypotential partner is infected is presumably muchhigher).Finally, those who believe that widespread heterosex-ual transmission in the United States is unlikely arguethat HIV is much less efficiently transmitted fromfemale-to-male than from male-to-female. In par-ticular, anal intercourse is considered much more likelythan vaginal intercourse to result in direct insertion ofthe virus into the bloodstream.26 In addition, the factthat anal intercourse is more prevalent among homo-sexuals than among heterosexuals is also asserted insupport of the prediction that homosexual transmis-sion of HIV will continue to be far more importantthan heterosexual transmission.While many researchers believe that female-to-maletransmission is less efficient, they also emphasize thatits existence has been clearly established and shouldnot be discounted. Moreover, they argue, epidemio-logical as well as biological factors may be involved.Because of the long incubation period, most AIDScases being reported now resulted from infectionswhich occurred when the virus was concentratedamong men. The fact that very few women were in- 12 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESfected meant that there were far fewer chances forfemale-to-male transmission to occur. As the numberof infected women increases, so will the probabilityof female-to-male transmission.27In sum, heterosexual transmission is an extremely com-plex issue, and its future course in the United Statesis unclear. Nevertheless, it has been clearly establishedthat heterosexual transmission occurs, and that it iscurrently most common in areas with large numbersof intravenous drug users, in minority groups, and inyoung adults.28Inoculation of BloodCurrently, exposure to HIV-contaminated bloodoccurs almost exclusively through needle-sharing byintravenous drug abusers. This is a population of par-ticular interest to correctional administrators, becauseit is over-represented among correctional inmates.There have been cases associated with blood transfu-sions and hemophiliacs' receipt of blood products.However, as already noted, the nation's supply ofblood and blood products is now considered safe, asa result of universal ELISA screening of doncited bloodand heat treatment of Factor VIII preparations ofblood products regularly given to hemophiliacs. Ad-ditionally, there have been a very small number of in-fections resulting from accidental needlesticks andother forms and blood-to-mucousmembrane exposure.Transmission Associated with Intravenous (IV) DrugUse.29 HIV is transmitted among IV drug usersprimarily through the exchange of blood which takesplace during sharing hypodermic needles, syringes,cotton (or other material used as a filter), and\"cookers,\" or containers in which the drug is heatedand/or dissolved. Blood of the previous user lodgesmost often in the tip of the hypodermic needle or inthe syringe, but may also be found in other parts ofthe apparatus.During injection, the user may draw his/her own bloodinto the syringe to mix with the dissolved drug and theninject the blood/drug mixture, a procedure known as\"booting\". This is done to make sure all traces of thedrug are removed from the syringe efficiently. As aresult, however, any blood from a prior user whichremains in the syringe or in the tip of the needle isinjected directly into subsequent users. Traditionally,any cleaning of the syringe or needle only involvesrinsing them in water or blowing into them, Steriliza-tion equipment is not readily available to users andspeed of injection is often paramount in the minds ofaddicts. Addicts may also be fearful of damaging21 precious equipment through sterilization proceduressuch as boiling. Users who \"skin pop\" drugs may alsoshare unsterile equipment. \"Skin popping\" is a tech-nique, common to early stages of IV drug use, in whichthe needle is inserted under the skin or into muscletissue rather than directly into a vein.The spread of HIV among IV drug users ha.. seen con-sistently linked to two factors: frequency of drug in-jection and the use of \"shooting galleries\" or similarcommercial operations. It has been shown that themore often one injects drugs, the more likely one isto borrow or rent injection equipment that containscontaminated blood, thus increasing the likelihood ofinfection. Shooting galleries rent drug injection equip-ment to multiple users. After one person uses theequipment, it is returned to the proprietor for rentalto the next person. Studies have shown that 90percent-100 percent of IV users report sharing needlesand almost three-quarters frequent shooting galleriesin areas where they flourish. Both needle sharing ingeneral and patronage of shooting galleries in par-ticular are most common among the most serious drugusers, since increased frequency of injection predictsincreased likelihood of both types of sharing.Shooting galleries are typically found in cities withlarge concentrations of IV drug users and are locatednear the areas in which drugs are sold. Shootinggalleries are particularly common in the New York Citymetropolitan area, and this is thought to help explainthe extremely high prevalence of HIV infection amongIV drug users (probably 60 percent) and the largenumber of IV drug -use-related AIDS cases in theregion. In smaller cities, shooting galleries are not asprevalent, but \"house works,\" which can serve thesame function of rapid spread of the virus among IVdrug users, are likely to be available. A dealer who isselling illicit drugs for injection will often keep a setof \"house works,\" injection equipment that is lent toa purchaser so the drugs can be used immediately.These works are then returned to the dealer for lendingto the next customer.It should be noted that the patronage of shootinggalleries or the use of house works are not the onlyopportunities for needle sharing among IV drug users.Sharing also often occurs as part of initiation into druguse and as part of important social behavior with otherusers. Even in areas where shooting galleries are notcommon, a large percentage of users report that theyshare injection equipment daily.Initiation into drug injection is also often the occa-sion of needle sharing. New users are unlikely to pur-chase their own injection equipment at first.Intravenous injection or \"skin popping\" is often donewith and by an associate or friend who is experiencedin the technique and who supplies the equipment.Initiation is not likely to be a planned event, and evensubsequent injection may not involve the user's pur-chase of his/her own equipment because steady usehas usually not been established at this point.Sharing \"works\" with a partner, friend, or lover ona regular basis is also a common part of the drugworld. Those who share are often \"running partners\".They commit crimes together and buy and use drugstogether. Sometimes, only one of the pair will carry\"works\" and share it with the other, both as a conven-ience and a token of friendship. Injecting together mayalso be a way of splitting an amount of drugs or amutual protection mechanism partners watch out forsigns of overdose. Sharing equipment in this fashionis an important social bond in the addict world, andrefusal to share may be seen as a serious sign ofmistrust or disloyalty among partners. Some sharingmay also simply be a response to a scarcity of needles.Users not necessarily as close as those described abovemay also share simply out of convenience.Transmission Through Accidental Needlesticks. Ac-cidental needlesticks and punctures involving in-struments contaminated with HIV-infected blood bearsome similarity to needle sharing among IV drugabusers. However, there are critical differences whichmake the risk associated with these accidental injuriesmuch lower than the risk involved in purposeful needlesharing activity. As discussed above, when intravenousdrug abusers share needles, a small amount of theuser's blood is often drawn into the syringe where itcan mix with the remnants of blood of previous userssimilarly drawn. This blood, together with the drug,is then injected directly into the user's bloodstream.In an accidental needlestick or puncture, by contrast,the risk is limited to the possibility that any con-taminated blood which is present on the needle orinstrument may come into contact with the blood ofthe person suffering the wound. In addition, addictedIV drug users who share needles are likely to experiencemultiple exposures which greatly increases their riskof infection over those who experience one isolatedexposure.As a result of these differences, the rate of HIVtransmission is much higher in needle sharing by IVdrug users than in accidental needlesticks. Researchersat the Centers for Disease Control and elsewhere havebeen gathering data on needlestick exposures to theAIDS virus for several years. Data from at least fiveU.S. studies suggest that the risk of HIV infection due 0VEssential Medical Information 13 to accidental needlestick or puncture wounds is ex-tremely small. Of 887 health care workers experienc-ing needlesticks with needles known to have beenpreviously used on HIV-infected patients, only four(0.5%) themselves became infected as a result of theseexposures 30 Additionally, of hundreds of dentalworkers many of whom cared for persons withAIDSstudied, only one became infected as a resultof these contacts. This individual had a history of cutsand needlesticks.Transmission Through Open Wound or Mucous Mem-brane Exposures.The risk associated with open-woundand mucous-membrane (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) ex-posures to HIV - contaminated blood is even lower thanthe risk associated with needlesticks. In three studiestotaling 435 health-care workers with open-wound ormucous-membrane exposure to the blood of knownHIV-infected patients, none became infected as a resultof these exposures. Nevertheless, CDC has consistentlystated that infection through such exposures wasp ossible .31Recent reports of five HIV infections (independent ofthe above-cited studies) apparently associated withnon-needlestick exposures have increased concernamong many occupational groups, including person-nel in corrections and law enforcement agencies. Twopersons providing nursing care to AIDS patientsbecame infected following extensive blood contact inwhich both failed to follow CDC-recommended infec-tion control procedures.However, the reports causing the most concern in-volved three health-care workers reported by CDC inlate May 1987 to have been infected following non-needlestick exposure to HIV-contaminated blood.32 Inthe first of these three cases, an ungloved health-careworker with chapped hands was in direct contact forabout 20 minutes with the blood of a patient laterfound to be infected with HIV. In the second case, amedical technologist, using a device for separation ofblood components, spilled HIV-contaminated bloodover most of her hands and forearms. Agai -., theworker was not wearing gloves and may have toucheda patch of dermatitis on her ear, which may haveresulted in blood contact with broken skin. In the thirdcase, a health-care worker, filling a tube with the bloodof an HIV-positive patient, was splattered with bloodon her face and in her mouth. This worker was notwearing a mask or face shield and apparently wasexposed by blood-to-mucous-membrane contact.33Although CDC was unable to rule out all other possi-ble risk factors in these three cases, the infections couldvery likely have been prevented if CDC-recommended 14 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL r 'ILITIESprocedures had been followed to prevent contact be-tween HIV-infected blood and broken skin or mucousmembranes. In Case One, the health-care worker hadchapped hands and was not wearing gloves; in CaseTwo, the technologist was not wearing gloves and alsotouched a patch of dermatitis in her ear with con-taminated hands; in Case Three, the worker was notwearing a mask or eye protection while working direct-ly with blood.34 While unbroken skin is an effectivebarrier against all micro-organisms, the proper use ofgloves will provide the wearer with valuable protec-tion should chafing, nicks, or other inapparent breaksbe present on the hands.Finally, concern may arise from the recent report ofa laboratory worker infected with HIV.33 This caseinvolved a researcher who had had regular and pro-longed contact in the laboratory with preparations ofHIV much more highly concentrated than are foundin normal samples of blood or body fluids. In-vestigators believe that the infection resulted from anincident or incidents similar to those experienced bythe three health-care workers just discussed. It shouldbe emphasized that the Natinilal Institutes of Healthhave tested hundreds of laboratory staff who haveworxed with HIV and this is the only known case ofinfection. Also, it is important to note that workingwith concentrated viruses in the laboratory is manyorders of magnitude more hazardous than working inany normal clinicalorcorrectional situation.Therefore, this incident of infection is not an accuratereflection of infectious hazards in any area of correc-tion or law enforcement.Perinatal TransmissionPerinatal transmission is the leading cause of AIDSamong infants and small children. More than three-fourths of all children with AIDS have had at least oneparent either with AIDS or in a group at high risk forHIV infection. Pediatric AIDS is closely associatedwith the infection of the mother and with intravenousdrug abuse. Mothers of pediatric AIDS cases arepredominantly intravenous drug abusers themselves,or the sexual partners of intravenous drug abusers.Most pediatric cases have been reported from NewYork City, northern New Jersey, and Florida. Blacksand Hispanics are dramatically over-representedamong children with AIDS.Infected mothers may transmit HIV to the fetus inutero, to the infant during labor and delivery, or tothe infant shortly after birth through infected breastmilk. The distribution of pediatric cases by these routesof transmission is not known, nor is the efficiency of 31 perinatal HIV transmission. However, it is generallybelieved that 40-50 percent of infants born of infectedmothers will themselves be infected by very early inlife.36No Transmission Through Casual ContactThe most critical point to convey in education andtraining programs regarding AIDS is that there isabsolutely no evidence of the infection being transmit-ted by casual contact. CDC emphasizes that AIDS isnot spread by sneezing, coughing, breathing, hugging,handshaking, sharing eating and drinking utensils, us-ing the same toilet facilities or any other form of non-sexual contact or activity. The lists of non-dangerouscontacts published by the CDC and by state and localpublic health agencies are not intended to be ex-haustive. Indeed, it would be impossible to developan exhaustive list. Therefore, if any particular type ofcontact is omitted from a list, this does not mean thatit is dangerous. The critical point is that the virus hasnot been transmitted by any type of casual contact.Strong evidence for the conclusion that HIV infectionis not spread by casual or even intimate non-sexualcontact comes from studies of family members ofAIDS patients and of health-care workers who criedfor AIDS patients, as well as from experience in othersettings where close but non-sexual contact or osten-sibly risky exposures have occurred. More than 50,000cases of AIDS have now been reported to the CDC,and not one of them has occurred in a family memberof another person with AIDS, unless that familymember had independent risk factors. Seven separatestudies totaling almost 500 family members of personswith AIDS have revealed no infect ons that could not be explained by independent ri. factors.37Studies of the type, duration, and frequency ofhousehold contact revealed important evidence, aswell. These family members regularly shared dishes,cooking and eating utensils, toothbrushes, razors,toilets, beds, baths, kitchens, and many other placesand objects with AIDS patients. In most householdsall clothing was washed together. The persons withAIDS and their family members also engaged in ex-tensive and frequent non-sexual physical contact suchas hugging, kissing on the cheek, and kissing on thelips. No special precautions against infection weretaken in any of these contacts or activities. In mostcases, sufficient time had elapsed between the start ofhousehold contact and the last evaluation of the familymember for seroconversion to have occurred. Yetnone, in fact, occurred.No Transmission in Social orOccupational SettingsThere is no evidence of HIV transmission as a resultof normal social or occupational interaction in schools,offices, churches, or other settings. A study of hemo-philiac and non-hemophiliac children in a Frenchprivate school found that half of the former, but noneof the latter had seroconverted. All these children hadh21 \"close casual contact, some of them for severalyears.\"38There have been no documented cases of police of-ficers, paramedics, or firefighters becoming infectedwith HIV as a result of rendering first aid or mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to an infected person or, infact, through any job-related incident.Finally, three annual NH surveys have identified no cases of correctional staff becoming infected ordeveloping AIDS as a result of contact with an infectedinmate.Evidence Against Transmission ThroughOther Body Fluids and Through BitingIncidentsDespite the fact that contact with blood, semen,vaginal secretions, and breast milk continue to be theonly known means of transmitting HIV, correctionalstaff have expressed concern that they might becomeinfected by contact with other body fluids such as mayoccur in biting or spitting incidents. All evidencecontinues to point to the extreme unlikelihood of HIVtransmission through such means.HIV has been isolated in saliva, tears, and urine,although at much lower concentrations than in bloodand semen. The virus has not been found in perspira-tion, feces, or vomitus. Researchers at MassachusettsGeneral Hospital attempted to grow HIV from eighty-three saliva samples taken from seventy-one homo-sexual men, all of whom were HIV seropositive (twen-ty were healthy, thirty-two had ARC, and nineteen hadAIDS). The actual virus could be grown from only one(1 percent) of these eighty-three saliva specimens. Incontemporaneous studies,other researchers arereaching similar conclusions.39 One study which foundHIV in saliva has been criticized on the ground thatthe saliva samples were not drawn directly from thesalivary glands, but from fluid already in the mouth,which may have contained blood. AIDS patientssometimes have intra-oral bleeding from gums andulcers.49 32Essential Medical Information 15 Further evidence against transmission through salivacomes from the family member studies discussedabove, and studies of dental workers. In the familymember studies, subjects frequently kissed personswith AIDS and handled items soiled by their salivawithout becoming infected. Although CDC cautionsthat there may be some theoreticai risk involved inideep kissing in which saliva is exchanged, they notethat there have been no reports of infection throughsuch con tact.41The primary reason that transmission through salivaor urine is so unlikely is that HIV is found in such lowconcentrations in these body fluids. It has beenestimated, for example, that one quart of saliva orurine would have to enter the bloodstream of anindividual for infection to occur.42Correctional officers and others who administercardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may wonderwhy CDC recommends using masks or airways whenperforming CPR if saliva is not an efficient mediumfor HIV transmission and no cases of such transmis-sion have been reported. The reason is that masksrepresent a reasonable precaution that also helps toprevent transmission of other infections that may bemore efficiently transmitted through saliva.Biting and spitting incidents may particularly concerncorrectional officers. Research findings on salivashould allay fears regarding the risk from spitting in-cidents and some of the fears regarding human bites.Biting may also involve blood contact, but it shouldbe emphasized that it is typically the individual doingthe biting who comes into contact with the blood ofthe victim, rather than the reverse. The victim cannotbe infected by the blood of the person committing thebite unless that person somehow has blood in his orher mouth that then comes into contact with the vic-tim's blood. There have been no reports of HIVtransmission through biting. In one study of eighty-six family members of children with AIDS, notransmission of the virus occurred despite occasionalbiting of siblings. In addition, an adult with AIDSreportedly bit thirty health-care workers, none ofwhom became infected as a result.43The possibility of transmission of HIV by food-serviceworkers bleeding or spitting in food has caused con-cern in some correctional facilities as well as in thecommunity at large. However, it would be very dif-ficult for such transmission to occur and there are nodocumented cases of this kind. To be successfullytransmitted through food, a sizable dose of the viruswould first have to get into the food and then intosomeone else's mouth. This in itself is unlikely, but 16 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESeven if it happened the virus would probably be killedby stomach acids. This would be the likely outcomein the common hypothetical correctional scenario inwhich an infected inmate working in a food serviceassignment deliberately or accidentally spits or bleedsin the food. Because there is no evidence that the in-fection is transmitted through food, CDC specificallyrecommends against screening food service workers forantibody to HIV.These research findings are all particularly importantto the correctional setting because of concerns amonginmates and correctional staff that HIV may betransmitted through human bites, urine-throwing in-cidents, contamination of food, and other such in-cidents that may occur in institutions. The research onfamily members and health-care workers withanalogous exposures (and even ostensibly more seriousexposures, such as needlesticks) indicates that theserisks are extremely low.Evidence Against Transmission by InsectsThe possibility that HIV can be transmitted by mos-quitoes, head lice, and other insects is periodicallyraised. Despite strong evidence against the possibilityof such transmission, and the virtually unanimousagn -nent among medical researchers that it does notoccur, even respected periodicals continue to keep theissue alive.44Primary concern regarding insect transmission in theUnited States has focused on Belle Glade, Florida, anextremely poor community largely composed of blackand Hispanic migrant workers with an unusually highconcentration of HIV infection and AIDS. However,strong evidence against insect transmission comes fromBelle Glade itself. Presumably, if insects transmit HIV,the infection would be found among children and theelderlyperhaps even more frequently among childrenthan among other age groups because they spend moretime outdoors. Yet, in Belle Glade, HIV infection isconcentrated among age groups which are most likelyto be sexually active and to abuse intravenous drugs.This strongly suggests that, in Belle Glade as elsewhere,sexual activity and needlesharing are the primarymeans of transmission.45 Moreover, serologic studiesrevealed that HIV-infected persons in Belle Glade wereno more likely than non-HIV-infected persons to havebeen exposed to other diseases typically transmittedby insects. If mosquitoes were transmitting HIV, onewould expect to find a close correlation between per-sons infected with HIV and with other insect-bornediseases.Insects may transmit infections in two waysbiologically and mechanically and neither has been shown to be possible with HIV. Biological transmis-sion requires that the insect ingest and replicate thevirus in its own body and transmit it to humansthrough a bite. Laboratory studies show that mos-quitoes do not replicate HIV or even retain it in theirbodies. Mechanical transmission involves passage ofthe virus through blood that the insect draws from aninfected person and that remains on the insect whenit bites the next person. This is extremely unlikely toc ;cur for several reasons. First, the amount of poten-tially involved blood is incredibly small. Second, aninsect bite is much more superficial than a needlestickor other intravenous puncture in which the virus is in-jected directly into the blood stream. Third, insects biteto feed on blood, not to inject blood, and they feedinfrequently some believe only once a day. Thus, thelikelihood that a mosquito or other insect will bite anHIV-infected person, acquire a sufficient amount ofinfected blood to transmit the virus, and find anuninfected person to bite before the blood dries andthe virus is killed, is so small as to be negligible.Prospects for Vaccines and CuresScientists have begun to make some significant pro-gress in understanding the complex structure andbehavior of HIV. Such knowledge is a prerequisite fordeveloping an AIDS vaccine. However, the goal isextremely elusive and new knowledge about the virusas often frustrates as contributes to progress on vac-cine development. HIV is a retrovirus, which meansthat it invades and incorporates itself into the geneticmaterial. It is thus more hidden than an ordinary virus,and it tends to change its guise, rendering it, in effect,a \"moving target\" difficult to attack with a single, staticvaccine.Despite the difficulties, several vaccines are in develop-ment, and two have been approved for clinical trials.The first, Vaxsyn HIV-1, was approved in August1987. This vaccine is hyphothesized to block certainviral proteins which bind to the receptor T-cell. Thusdenied access, the virus cannot infect T-lymphocytes.This vaccine is being tested in sixty healthy sero-negative male homosexuals, broken into four groups,each receiving a different dose. A control group, whichwill receive no vaccine, has also been recruited.There are significant ethical problems with any HIVvaccine trial. First, the members of the control groupare being denied whatever beneficial effects the vac-cine may have. Second, the vaccine renders the reci-pient seropositiv: by current HIV antibody tests, andthus subject to possible discrimination and stigma. Asa result, the investigators have issued all subjects cer-tificates stating that they have been vaccinated and notinfected with HIV. If the first phase of the trialdesigned to determine the toxicity, not efficacy of thevaccinegoes satisfactorily, a second phase would in-vestigate optimum dosages in a large population. Athird phase, involving large populations, could beginin 1990. A second vaccine, developed by Oncogen ofSeattle, Washington, was approved for clinical trialsin November 1987.46There has also been progress in the development oftherapeutic drugs. Zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT))was approved by the Food and Drug Administrationin 1987 for treatment of AIDS patients with advancedillness characterized by Pneumocystis carinii pneu-monia, and symptomatic cases of AIDS-related com-plex (ARC). AZT was not originally approved for usein persons with other indicator diseases or with asymp-tomatic HIV infection. This was because the drug isvery toxic and has serious side-effects in some patients,including severe anemia and other blood problems.Very recently, however, the manufacturer of AZT,Burroughs Wellcome Company, has indicated that thedrug may be able to retard the onset of illness inasymptomatic individuals. Clinical trials of AZT inasymptomatically infected individuals are in progress,but enrollment of participants has been slow, and theresults may not be known for several years.47In one clinical trial, patients receiving AZT were foundto have prolonged short-term survival, reduced fre-quency of opportunistic infections, increased T-4helper cell counts, and weight gain. However, it mustbe emphasized that AZT does not cure AIDS. It doesnot reverse the underlying immune deficiency whichrenders the patient susceptible to opportunistic infec-tions and cancers.48Research on therapeutic drugs has suffered setbacks.There have also been prematurely dramatic an-nouncements of therapeutic success, which later hadto be retracted or qualified. Several drugs originallythought to hold promise, such as suramin, have beenfound to be ineffective. In general, prospects for a vac-cine or cure for AIDS remain less than promising forthe immediate future. The National Academy ofSciences concluded that the probability of an effec-tive vaccine becoming available in the next five-tenyears is \"low.\" The report also concludes that \"develop-ment of therapy fc r HIV infection will most likely bea difficult and long-term process, with no presentlyavailable guarantees of success. \"49 The poor prospectsfor vaccines or cures in the foreseeable future onlyserve to underline the importance of educational ef-forts. As many have already stated, education is theonly available weapon against AIDS. Essential Medical Information 17 Notes1.

Essential Medical Information 19 Chapter 2: The Epidemiology of HIV Infection andAIDS in Correctional Facilities and the Population at Large This chapter presents basic epidemiological informa-tion on HIV infection and AIDS in the Americanpopulation as a whole, and in correctional populationsin the United States and Canada. For the populationat large, the chapter presents the current and likelyfuture dimensions of the epidemic, and discusses thebreakdown of cases by region, demographic charac-teristics, and transmission categories. Three successiveNIJ surveys have failed to identify a single job-relatedcase of HIV infection or AIDS among correctionalstaff. For correctional inmates, distribution of AIDScases by systems, regions, transmission categories, anddemographic characteristics are presented. The chapteralso discusses the prevalence of ARC and HIVseropositivity among inmates and synthesizes availableinformation on the transmission of HIV in prisons.HIV Infection and AIDS in thePopulation at LargeThe dimensions of the AIDS problem in the UnitedStates continue to grow alarmingly. On January 4,1988 the 50,000th case in the United States wasreported to CDC. There have been over 700 pediatriccases. Through the end of 1987, almost 28,000 per-sons had died of AIDS in the United States.' InCanada, 1300 adult cases and twenty six pediatric caseshad been reported as of November 1, 1987. There hadbeen 699 deaths.2New York State and California together account foralmost 50 percent of the AIDS cases in the UnitedStates, while New Jersey, Florida, and Texas collec-tively account for another 21 percent. Within thesestates, as elsewhere, cases are heavily concentrated incities and major metropolitan areas. In addition toconfirmed AIDS cases, the National Academy ofSciences estimates that there may be as many as 50,000to 125,J00 cases of AIDS-Related Complex in theUnited States and the U.S. Public Health Serviceestimates that there are 1-1.5 million asymptomaticHIV infected individuals. CDC believes 270,000 AIDScases will have been diagnosed in the United States bythe end of 1991 and that, by that year, over 50,000people will be dying of AIDS each year more thanwere killed in the entire Vietnam War.3Ninety-two percent of all American AIDS cases havebeen in males and 88 percent of the cases have beenin persons aged 20-49 years. In Canada, males repre-sent 94 percent of cases, and 88 percent of cases have 3 7been in persons aged 20-49 years. There still have beenvery few AIDS cases among adolescents in the UnitedStates or Canada (less than 1 percent are in persons13-19 years old). Yet, some consider this age groupat particular risk for HIV infection and illness in thenext few years, because of the prevalence of carelesssexual practices among adolescents and the growth ofintravenous drug use among teenagers in some areas of the country.The overall racial/ethnic distribution of adult cases inthe United States has remained essentially the samesince 1985: White- 60 percent; Black - 25 percent;Hispanic - 14 percent; Other/unknown - 1 percent.Blacks and Hispanics (12 percent and 7 percent, respec-tively, of the American population as a whole) are thusdisproportionately represented. Blacks and Hispanicsare particularly overrepresented among women withAIDS (51 percent and 20 percent, respectively) andamong pediatric cases (54 percent and 23 percent,respectively).4 Many of the minority women withAIDS are intravenous drug abusers or sexual partnersof male intravenous drug abusers.The most recent CDC breakdown of confirmed AIDScases in the United States by transmission category isshown in Figure 2.1. There is an overlap of approxi-mately 8 percent between the homosexual/bisexual andintravenous drug abuser categories. Thus, about 25percent of reported adult AIDS cases are in personswith some history of intravenous drug abuse and about74 percent of cases have been in homosexual/bisexualmales. The only change in the risk group distributionsince 1985 was a 3-percent decrease in the\"other/unclassified\" category and a correspondingincrease in the heterosexual partner category. Thisrepresented a shift of Haitian-born persons from theformer to the latter category based on the belief thatheterosexual transmission is prevalent in Haiti.Many epidemiologists believe the percentage of casesattributed to intravenous drug abuse is likely to growdramatically in the next few years. Moreover, theybelieve the greatest threat for s;gnificant spread ofinfection to the heterosexual population is throughinfection of the female sexual partners of intravenousdrug users. This, in turn, suggests that perinataltransmission of HIV may become an increasinglyserious problem.The \"undetermined\" cases are thought to have hadknown risk factors, but information on these factorsEpidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 21 Figure 2.1BREAKDOWN OF ADULT/ADOLESCENT AIDS CASES IN THE U.S.BY TRANSMISSION CATEGORIES Number of Percent of AllTransmission Category Cases CasesHomosexual/Bisexual Male 31,825 65%Intravenous (IV) Drug Abuser 17Homosexual a These individualsare thought to have had known risk factors, but information on these factors was not available for various reasonse.g., they died before they could be interviewed, they refused to be interviewed, or they had forgotten or failed to admit high-risk behaviors.Source: CDC, AIDS Weekly Surveillance Report United States, December 28, 1987. was unavailable for various reasons e.g., the indi-viduals could not be interviewed before they died, theyrefused to be interviewed, or they had forgotten orfailed to admit activities involving possible exposure.In Canada, 82 percent of cases have been in homo-sexual or bisexual males and 3 percent in persons witha history of IV drug use.The latest medical research and epidemiological datatogether show that AIDS is a very serious and grow-ing problem, but also that HIV is transmissible onlyby homosexual and heterosexual activity, blood-to-blood contact, and perinatal events. In all settings,including correctional agencies, the response to AIDSshould stress both of these facts. Education andprevention programs which rationally address the realnature and extent of the risk should be implemented.It is equally dangerous to take a complacent or analarmist approach to this problem.HIV Infection and AIDS inCorrectional FacilitiesNo Job-Related Cases of HIV Infection orAIDS Among Correctional StaffCorrectional staff in almost every jurisdiction haveexpressed concern about the possibility of contracting 22 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESHIV infection or AIDS from inmates in the institu-tions. However, responses to three successive NIJsurveys indicate that there are no known cases ofAIDS, ARC, or HIV seropositivity among correctionalstaff as a result of contact with inmates. HennepinCounty (Minneapolis), Minnesota tested six correc-tional officers who claimed to have been potentiallyexposed to infection in on-the-job incidents. Theseincidents included needlesticks and fights in whichblood was drawn. None of the officers tested positive.Similarly, the Oklahoma correctional system tested tenofficers involved in potential transmission incidents,and Oregon tested seven officers; none were found tobe HIV-seropositive. Neither have there been any job-related cases of infection among police officers,firefighters, emergency medical technicians, or anyother public safety workers.Survey respondents reported seventeen cases of AIDSamong current or former staff members, but none ofthese individuals had been involved in incidents withinmates in which transmission of the infection couldhave occurred. Rather, these staff members becameinfected through behavior totally independent of theirjobs. When an officer at New York's Sing Sing facilitydeves'ed AIDS, correctional authorities immediatelyinves...ated and determined that the infection hadresulted from independent risk factors. This incorma- S Figure 2.2CUMULATIVE TOTAL AIDS CASES AMONG U.S. CORRECTIONAL INMATESAND THE U.S. POPULATION AT LARGE, 1985-1987 NovemberOctoberPercentIncreaseOctoberPercentIncrease in /adolescent cases.

Indeed, education and training shouldstress that staff need to take care to avoid infectionboth on the job and in their private lives. In the climateof fear that may exist among officers in some correc-tional systems, there may be too much emphasis onthe possibility of job-related infection and insufficientattention to the (probably greater) possibility of infec-tion through private activity.AIDS Cases Among Correctional InmatesAs of October 1, 1987, there had been a cumulativetotal of 1,964 confirmed AIDS cases among inmatesin seventy responding federal, state, and local correc-tional systems in the United States (Figure 2.2). Therehad been 1,320 cases in thirty-nine state and federalcorrectional systemsup 190 percent from the 455cases reported as of November 1, 1985, the time ofthe original survey, and up 68 percent from the 784cases reported as of October 1, 1986. Thirty-oneresponding city and county jail systems reported 644casesup 107 percent from the 311 cases reported inthe original survey in 1985 and up 44 percent from the448 cases reported in 1986. Total AIDS cases in allresponding American correctional systems thus in-creased from 766 to 1,964or 156 percent in the twoyears since the first survey and 59 percent in the oneyear since the second survey. This is a large increasein cases, but it is, in fact, slightly lower than the 61percent national increase from 28,002 cases to 41,770during the same period (October 1986 to October1987).5 As shown in Figure 2.2, the growth in AIDScases was slightly slower in correctional systems thanin the population at large both between 1985-1986 and1986-1987. Moreover, it should be noted that the NIJsurvey results probably include some double-countingof casesthat is, individuals who were known to haveAIDS while they were in county jail and then entereda state institution. These cases would probably havebeen counted by both the county and state correctionalsystems.In Canada, a cumulative total of two cases wasreported by the federal system and thirteen cases byprovincial systems.The figures above are cumulative totals that is, allcases reported since the correctional systems begankeeping records. Thirty-nine state and federal systemsin the United States reported 295 current cases of AIDSamong inmates, while thirty-one responding city andcounty systems reported 126 current cases. There werefour cases in Canadian systems as of October 1, 1987.State and federal systems in the United States reportthat a cumulative total of 716 inmates have died fromAIDS while in custody; responding city and countysystems in the U.S. report 159 inmate deaths. Of 875total inmate AIDS deaths in the United States, 346or40 percent have occurred since the 1986 survey wastaken. Canadian correctional systems report threedeaths among inmates.The distribution of cumulative total AIDS cases acrosscorrectional systems in the United States is still quiteskewed (Figure 2.3), although not so uneven as in thefirst two surveys. While twelve more systems than lastyear reported at least one case, more than 70 percentof state and federal systems and almost two-thirds ofthe responding city and county systems still have hadfewer than ten cases. At the other extreme, only sixstate and federal systems and one responding city orcounty system have had more than fifty cases. Fourstate systems (8 percent) account for 73 percent of thecumulative total AIDS cases, while four of the re- Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 23 Range ofTotal AIDS Cases 01-34-10I 1-2526-5051-100>100TotalFigure 2.3DISTRIBUTION OF CONFIRMED AIDS CASES AMONG INMATES,BY TYPE sponding city and county systems (12 percent) con-tribute 67 percent of the cases. These distributions aredepicted graphically in Figures 2.4 and 2.5.The Middle Atlantic states still account for the vastmajority of AIDS cases among correctional inmates(Figure 2.6). Sixty-two percent of state systems' casesand 57 percent of cases in responding city and county24 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESsystems have been in the Middle Atlantic region.However, it should be noted that correctional AIDScases have increased in all regions since the originalsurvey was taken and the regional distribution is lessuneven than it was several years ago. More and morecorrectional systems are likely to experience AIDScases each year, OCTOBER 1987Across State/Federal Prison Systems 1220n Systems % of Total Cases 5724 01-34-1011-2526-50Range of Cases per Systemcases will probably remain somewhat skewed acrosscorrectional systems and geographic regions.The incidence rate of AIDS in the entire United Statespopulation was 8.6 cases per 100,000 persons in 1987,6up from 5.3 in 1986 and 3.4 in 1985. Incidence ratesfor individual states range from zero to twenty - three,with most under three. In state and federal correctionalsystems, incidence rates ranged from zero to 230,although two-thirds of the states have rates less thantwenty-five and only two have rates over 100. The ag-gregate,cidence rate for all state/federal systems wasfifty -four cases per 100,000 inmates.? Rates in city andcounty jail systems vary from zero to 1,280 cases per100,000, but one-half of the jurisdictions have ratesunder twenty-five. The aggregate incidence rate for allresponding city/county systems was 126 cases per100,000 inmates. Rapid population turnover makesthese jail incidence statistics extremely suspect. In51-100100 general, the profile of incidence rates in correctionalsystems was quite similar in 1986 and 1987. The ag-gregate incidence rate for all Canadian inmates wasthirteen per 100,000, substantially lower than in theUnited States.incidence rates are predictably higher in correctional;Items than in the population at large because of thencentration in inmate populations of persons with1 stories of high-risk behavior, particularly intravenousdrug use. Moreover, the method of calculating in-cidence rates per 100,000 population guarantees thata correctional system with a N ery small number ofAIDS cases the typical case will have a somewhathigher rate than a much larger outside population withsubLtantially more AIDS cases.The wide range in incidence rates obviously reflectsthe uneven distribution of AIDS cases across correc- 41Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS OCTOBER 1987Across City/County Jail Systems 1220n Systems % of Total Cases 57r1 24 01-34-1011-2526-50Range of Cases per System tional systems. The jurisdictions with the highest in-cidence rates continue to be in the Middle Atlanticregion, where HIV infection is pervasive among in-travenous drug users who are dramatically over-represented in correctional institutions.It should also be noted that there are wide variationsin the incidence of AIDS in the general populationboth within and across states. For example, there areparticularly high incidence rates in the New YorkCity/Northern New Jersey metropolitan area. Theseare almost certainly associated with widespreadneedlesharing among intravenous drug users in\"shooting galleries\" and elsewhere.Characteristics of Inmate AIDS CasesThe vast majority of inmate AIDS cases in the UnitedStates have been among men (95 percent), althoughcases are now appearing among women as well (95cases or 5 percent). In Canada, the sex breakdown is93 percent male inmates and 7 percent female inmates. 26 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES51-100100 American correctional systems were only able to pro-vide racial/ethnic breakdowns covering 30 percent ofcumulative total cases, and several of the jurisdictionswith large numbers of cases were unable to providethis information. However, of the cases so classified,32 percent were among whites, 58 percent amongblacks, and 10 percent among Hispanics. All of theCanadian cases have been among whites.Virtually all inmate AIDS cases are thought to berelated to intravenous drug abuse or sexual activity.On average, correctional systems attributed two-thirdsof their male cases to IV drug abuse and 43 percentto homosexual activity. Predictably, female cases wereoverwhelmingly (92 percent, on average) attributed toIV drug use. However, it is important to note that insome correctional systems, particularly those in theMiddle Atlantic region, the percentage of all casesattributed to IV drug abuse is much higher thanelsewhere. Of course, these are also among the systemswith the largest number of inmate AIDS cases. Ingeneral, intravenous drug abuse is a much more im-,...,4A:: 1 Figure 2.6REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL AIDS CASESBY TYPE OF SYSTEM, UNITED STATES(Federri Bureau of Prisons Excluded) Original Survey:November 1985State Rhode Island, Connecticut bNew York, New Jersey, PennsylvaniacOhio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, WisconsindMinnesosa, lows, Missouri, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, KansaseDelaware, Maryland, District of Columbia, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida(Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, MississippigArkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, TexashMontana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada'Washington, Oregon, California, Alaska, Hawaii3Due to rounding.Source: NIJ Questionnaire Responses.4 -3Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 27 portant transmission category in correctional AIDScases than in AIDS in the population at large. Fully96 percent of cases in the New York State correctionalsystem are intravenous drug abusers, as opposed to34 percent of cases in the New York State populationat large.8 This is not surprising, given the highprevalence of intravenous drug abuse among criminaloffenders. In adun,... ,.i, there is already a particularlyhigh incidence of AIDS among intravenow. drugabusers in the New York City/Northern New Jerseyarea. A study of 326 inmate deaths from AIDS in theNew York State correctional system reveals some strik-ing demographic information. Ninety-six percent weremales, and 75 percent were between 25 and 39 yearsold. Fully 95 percent of these inmates admitted to in-travenous drug abuse, 45 percent were Hispanic, 43percent were black, only 12 percent were white, and87 percent came from New York City .8 BecauseHispanics and Blacks are overrepresented among in-travenous drug abusers, state correctional officialsbelieve that this breakdown reflects the strong correla-tion between intravenous drug abuse and AIDS bothin the state population at large and in the state cor-rectional population.AIDS-Related Complex (ARC) AmongCorrectional InmatesBecause of definitional variations and uneven record-keeping, it is difficult to estimate the number of ARCcases among inmates. Several of the jurisdictions withthe largest numbers of AIDS cases still do not main-tain figures on ARC. Thus, available statistics on ARCare probably artificially low. NIJ survey responsesreport 498 current ARC cases I:: state and federalsystems in the United States, :aid eighty-one currentcases in city and county systems in the United States.Canadian correctional systems report six cases ofARC.HIV Seroprevalence Among CorrectionalInmatesThere has been a great deal of speculation about theprevalence of asymptomatic HIV infection among cor-rectional inmates. As discussed in Chapter Four, anincreasing number of jurisdictions have instituted HIVantibody screening and testing programs. Some ofthese jurisdictions screen all inmates or all identifiedmembers of AIDS risk groups and link results withindividual inmates; others have conducted (or are plan-ning to conduct) blind epidemiological studies in whichtest results are never linked with individual subjects.Such epidemiological studies are underway in Illinois 28 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESand Maryland; New York State and a number of otherstates are about to begin studies.Many survey respondents provided aggregate resultsfrom their screening and testing programs. Most pro-grams are small-scale, involving some combination ofinmates with clinical indications, those in risk groups,and those who request testing. Data from such testingprograms cannot be used to suggest seroprevalencebecause of the biases introduced in the selection pro-cess. However, ten states and the Federal Bureau ofPrisons reported aggregate results of mass screeningprograms, six jurisdictions reported the result.) of \"riskgroup\" screening, five jurisdictions reported the resultsof blind epidemiological studies and six jurisdictionsreported results from other large-scale testing pro-grams. These results are shown in Figures 2.7 - 2.10.Figure 2.7 shows that seroprevalence rates among new,current and about-to-be released inmates in massscreening jurisdictions were very low from 0 to 2.6percent, with all but five of the groups under 1 per-cent. Most of these are comparable to estimatedseroprevalence rates in the population at large. Sixjurisdictions reported the results of large-scale screen-ing intravenous drug abuserswhich are shown inFigure 2.8. In one county jail system, all female prosti-tutes were tested at intake. In general, seroprevalencerates in these fish groups were higher than among allinmates, but in all but one jurisdiction (33%), theywere 4 percent or less.Figure 2.9 shows that, of all jurisdictions reporting theresults of blind epidemiological studies, Marylandfound the highest seroprevalence rates 7 percentamong incoming men and 15 perc: .at among incom-ing women. These rates have held remarkably constantfor three annual studies.1\u00b0 The higher rate is attributedto the fact that a larger percentage of female inmatesthan male inmates in Maryland have histories of in-travenous drug abuse. Otherwise, the seroprevalencerates found in epidemiological studies were below 1percent, including 0.9 percent in Michigan, a state witha significant urbzIV-drug using population.Finally, Figure 2.10 presents results from other testingprograms in six jurisdictions. These include testing ofprospective participants in plasmaphoresis programs,and of inmates who request or volunteer to be tested.These seroprevalence rates are also quite low.

The complexity is largelydue to the length and variability of the incubationperiod of AIDS, wilich make it difficult to know ex-actly when transmission of the virus occurred. Thereis sharp debate on the subject, but little hard data asyet. Currently available data suggest low rates oftransmission within correctional facilities.Number HIVSeropositive010Seropositive The United States Army conducted follow-up testingof 542 inmates of a military prison who had been HIV-seronegative on intake during 1983-1984. The follow-up testing was done in July 1985, after most of theinmates had been incarcerated between one and two years. None had seroconverted.11In 1985, Maryland conducted voluntary testing of 137inmates in one facility who had been continuouslyincarcerated for seven years or more. The testingrevealed two confirmed seropositives (1.5%). Becauseof their continuous incarceration since before the virusappeared in the United States, these two inmates are Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 2943 JurisdictionFigure 2.8RESULTS aUnless HIVSeropositive%Seropositive 111.4 held constant in two subsequent intake seroprevalence studies done in 1986 and 1987. 30 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES46 Figure 2.10RESULTS OF OTHER HIV ANTIBODY TESTING noted, all data are current as of October 1987.strongly believed to have become infected while inprison. Maryland officials point out that these datasuggest very low transmission rates in their system.Moreover, these seroconversions occurred before theimplementation of intensive educational programs onAIDS which are believed to have influenced inmatebehavior. Maryland has also conducted follow uptesting of the original intake cohort used to estimateincoming seroprevalence. Over 300 inmates werefollowed for one year, and 200 inmates for two years;less than one-half of 1percent per year haveseroconverted. This translates into a possible sixty newinfections per year in the entire inmate population, anot insignificant figure, but one far lower than theestimated 300 infections among entering inmates eachyear. As a result, the Chief Medical Officer of theMaryland Division of Correction asserts that HIV in-fection \"is more of an imported problem than one be-ing developed in prison.\"12New York state recently analyzed the periods of con-tinuous incarceration of all of its correctional inmateswith AIDS. The analysis revealed that none of theinmates had been continuously incarcerated for morethan seven years prior to their diagnosis, and only fiveinmates (2.3%) had been continuously incarcerated forfive to seven years prior to their diagnosis. A similaranalysis of Florida inmate AIDS cases also revealedthat only 2 percent had been continuously incarceratedfor seven years or more prior to diagnosis. The resthad all been in prison two years or less.13These figures suggest quite low rates of HIV transmis-sion in correctional facilities. However, as the NewYork report notes, \"the long incubation period, theexistence of the asymptomatic HIV carrier state, smallnumber of long-term inmates and absence of data onantibody status make this finding inconclusive.\"14 Inaddition,thereare significant variations acrossjurisdictions in the prevalence of infection and varia-tions in the prevalence of high-risk behaviors in cor-rectional facilities. Both of these variables would effecttransmissionrates. A recently-initiated CDC-sponsored study of Illinois inmates and a studyplanned in New York should begin to provide moresystematic information on these issues.Meanwhile, the debate continues over the extent towhich HIV infection is being transmitted in correc-tional institutions. On one side of the debate, correc-tional administrators point to the paucity of AIDScases among long-term inmates and some argue fur-ther that AIDS is not being transmitted in prisonsbecause the behaviors primarily associated withtransmission (sexual activity and intravenous drugabuse) are effectively controlled in the institutions.Questionnaire respondents are virtually unanimous inthe belief that all of their inmates with AIDS broughtthe infection with them into the institution rather thancontracting it after they were incarcerated. These con-clusions are based on the fact that the intervals betweenthese inmates entering the system and their diagnoseswith AIDS were generally much shorter than mostestimates of the disease's incubation period.4 7Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 31 On the other hand, some physicians and researchersargue from the following syllogism:1) HIV infection is transmitted through sex-ual activity and intravenous drug abuse;2) There may be a relatively high infectionrate among inmates;3) Some sexual activity and intravenous drugabuse occurs in even the best-managed cor-rectional institutions; therefore4) It is highly likely that HIV infection is be-ing transmitted in correctional institu-tions.15There are a number of factors regarding prison lifethat should be considered in attempting to assess thepotential extent and primary means of transmission:Known outbreaks of syphilis and othersexually-transmitted diseasesin prisonpopulations suggest that HIV can also betransmitted in the correctional setting.In two studies, the annual seroconversionratesfor Hepatitis-Bin correctionalfacilities were found to be about 1 per-cent.16 Bearing in mind that Hepatitis -B iseasier to transmit than HIV infection, thesefigures may help to suggest how mushtransmission of HIV infection is occurringin correctional institutions. On the otherhand, seroconversion rates for Hepatitis-B may underestimate the extent of behaviorthrough which the virus is transmitted(e.g., sexual activity and intravenous drugabuse), since there appear to be high ratesof immunity toHepatitis-B amongprisoners. Thus, they may be engaging insuch behaviors without seroconverting.Many (in some jurisdictions, most) inmateshave histories of intravenous drug abuse.While it is unclear how much drug abuseinvolving needle-sharing occurs in prison(and some observers believe that drug usenot involving needles is much more com-mon), it is probably inevitable that at leastsome takes place.Reportedly, tattooing and the use of tat-too machines are prevalent in many correc-tionalfacilities, and thisactivity mayexpose inmates to blood contaminated Withthe AIDS virus.The prevalence of all types of sexual activi-ty may vary widely across correctional 32 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESsystems. A study of New York City jail in-mates found that 10 percent of all gonococ-cal infections (gonorrhea cases) diagnosedbetween October and December 1986 wereacquired while the inmate was ih the cor-rectional facility. The study used gonorrheaas a surrogate for homosexual activity.Since the normal incubation perk d is two-six days, any inmate diagnosed with a newcase of gonorrhea more than one weekafter intake was considered to have becomeinfected while incarcerated.17 A study ofTennessee inmates based on self reportsfound that 18 percent had engaged inhomosexual activity while incarcerated.18Finally, a report by the Federal Bureau ofPrisons (based on data from the federalsystem and from some state systems)estimates that 28 percent of inmates en-gaged in homosexual activity while inprison.19 It should be noted this estimateis based on anecdotal evidence collectedbefore AIDS became a serious problem inthe United States. Since then, AIDS-relatededucational efforts may have reduced theincidence of homosexual activity in correc-tional facilities.Of particular concern with regard to thequestion of HIV transmission in prison isthe extent to which inmate sexual activityiscoerced. According to the FederalBureau of Prisons report, perhaps 9 to 20percent of prison inmates (particularly newinmates and openly homosexual inmates)are targets of aggressive sex acts duringtheir incarceration. However, in the federalsystem, less than 1 percent were found tohave been actually victimized.20 Otherobservers believe rape and sexual assaultare very prevalent and very underreportedin correctional facilities.21Prison sexuality is complex; it probably in-cludes consensual, quasi-consensual (i.e.,submission based on initial and ongoingintimidation or submission in return forprotection, extra commissary items, orother favors), and non-consensual activity.Prostitution and pimping also exist in in-mate populations. Some argue that trulyconsensual sexual activity does not exist inprisons and jails. Only 8 percent of NIJsurvey respondents stating an opinionbelieved that it is possible to distinguish 46' clearly between consensual and non-consensual sex in correctional facilities,while 50 percent felt that the distinction is\"somewhat unclear.\" The various com-ponents of sexual activity require very dif-ferent responses, insofar as the preventionof HIV infection and AIDS is concerned.Consensual activity may be addressedthrough educational programs (and thereare indications that behavioral change isoccurring in prisons, perhaps as a result ofeducational efforts). On the other hand, itmay only be possible to reduce quasi-consensual and non-consensual activity bymore careful inmate classification, moreintensive supervision or surveillance, andmore effective prosecution of inmaterapists. For example, some systems seek toNotes1. Unless otherwise noted, all figures on AIDS in the Americanpopulation are from CDC, \"AIDS Weekly Surveillance Report- United States,\" December 28, 1987.2.

A critical element of all correc-tional systems' policies must be the preven-tion of rapes and other non-consensualsexual activity through which HIV infec-tion may be transmitted to victims.As noted above, there are currently no conclusive dataon the extent of transmission of HIV infection withincorrectional facilities. However, logic and commonsense both suggest that, even in the best-managed cor-rectional institutions, there may be at least sometransmission of the AIDS virus occurring among in-mates. The question for correctional administratorsis what policies are most likely to minimize transmis-sion, while maintaining the essential rights of inmates. 11.Kelley, P.W., Redfield, R.R. et al., \"Prevalence and Incidenceof HTLV-III in a Prison\" (letter), Journal of the AmericanMedical Association, October 24, 1986; 256:2198-2199.12.

Epidemiology of HIV Infection and AIDS 334 0 PRrt Two Policy Options for Correctional Administrators 50 Part Two of this report covers the following majorareas of correctional policy on AIDS:education andtraining; HIV antibody screening and testing; medical,psycho-social, and correctional management issues;and confidentiality, legal, and labor relations issues.There is substantial debate in many of these areas. Thereport presents the rationales advanced for variouspolicies as well as the results of the NIJ survey on theprevalence of the major options identified.Four major issues affect almost all aspects of correc-tional decisionmaking regarding AIDS.1. The importance of effective education andtraining for both staff and inmates.2. The relative importance of medical andcorrectional considerations inpolicydecisions.3. The extent and nature of the correctionalsystem's responsibility for preventing thetransmission of HIV infection within itsinstitutions.4. The inter-relatedness of many key AIDS-related policy decisions.To address the first issue, correctional administratorsmust develop a clear understanding of the concernsboth rational and irrational of their inmates andstaffs regardingAIDS.Once they have this under-standing, they can develop educational programs thataddress those concerns and that offer practical meansfor preventing the spread of HIV infection in correc-tional institutions.To address the second issue correctionalad-ministrators must decide whether to coii;!;.:zr AIDSpurely as a medical problem and frame all their policiesregarding screening, testing, housing, medical care,and precautionary measures based on medicalknowledge and advice, or whether (and how much)they should also take into account the special cir-cumstances of the correctional environment. These cir-cumstances include the potential concentration ofpersons with risk factors in the correctional popula-tion, the need to maintain the personal safety of theinmates and staff, and the need to maintain the se-curity and order of the institutions. Correctional con-siderations might suggest mass screening of inmatesfor antibodies to HIV or administrative segregationof inmates withAIDSandARC,even if medicalauthorities do not generally recommend such policiesfor the population at large.To address the third issue, decisionmakers must deter-mine how much legal and ethical responsibility cor-rectional systems should bear forpreventingtransmission of HIV infection and whether theirresponsibilities should be more extensive in any waythan those borne by other institutions such as hospitalsand schools. In particular, the question arises whethercorrectional systems are responsible (and perhapslegally liable) for transmission of HIV resulting fromconsensual acts, or only for transmission resultingfrom coerced acts. The answers to such questions willdetermine, first, what procedures and precautionsshould be undertaken to prevent the spread of theAIDSvirus in correctional institutions and, second,what notifications, if any, should be made to correc-tional staff, previous and subsequent institutions,public health agencies, parole officials, families, andsexual partners regarding inmates with AIDS, ARC,or asymptomatic HIV infection.To address thefourth issue,correctional ad-ministrators should think of their AIDS policyin \"big-picture\" terms. That is, before deciding to undertakemass screening, they must decide how the test resultswill be used to achieve the only legitimate purpose ofscreeningreduction of HIV transmission. Moreover,screening decisions may drive other decisions. Forexample, should HIV-infected inmates be segregated?Docorrectional officers have a right to know whichinmates are infected with HIV? A policydecision toscreen all inmates for antibodies to HIV may have amajor, and perhaps deciding, effect on housing andnotification policies. Mass screening without someform of segregation or separation of seropositiveswhose behaviors indicate that they may pose a risk ofinfecting others seems to be an ineffective policycombination. Failing to separate these seropositiveswould seem to forfeit whatever possibility that massscreening will reduce transmission of HIV.Asdisrissed in Chapter Four, there is serious con-troversy about the effectiveness of screening in reduc-ing transmission of HIV. But without segregation orseparation of seropositives, screening can have littleor no effect on transmission. Therefore, correctionalsystems should probably think in terms of decidingbetween two basic constellations of policies:1. mass screening, segregation of seropositiveswho pose behavioral risks, notification tocorrectional staff, and education on AIDS:or2. focusing prevention efforts on mandatoryAIDSeducation and intensive efforts toidentify and control predatory inmatesand those engaging in high-risk behavior (without mass HIV screening), togetherwith strict confidentiality of medical infor-mation.Expected seropositive rates and the availability ofvarious types of housing (e.g., single- v. double-cells)will play an important role in these interrelated policy'lecisions. Ultimately, however, these large policy deci-sions must be grounded in careful consideration of theadvantages and disadvantages of the major options.Most correctional systems have now adopted AIDSpolicies. (Examples of comprehensive correctionalAIDS policies are included in Appendix G.) Intensepolitical pressure for certain policies especially massscreeninghas been focussed on correctional systemsin the last year. The challenge for the future is to resistshort-term political pressure and to ensure that therefinement and implementation of policies are basedon considered judgment and rational response to therisks posed by AIDS in the correctional setting. Thisreport is designed to help correctional administratorsmeet that challenge. Chapter 3: Education and Training Education and training programs represent the key-stone of efforts to prevent transmission of HIV infec-tion in prisons and jails, as well as in the populationat large. In fact, the actual and potential role of educa-tion affects decisions on virtually tea of the other issuesand policy options discussed in this report. For ex-ample, the effectiveness of educational programs mayplay a major role in deciding whether inmates withAIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HP/ infection shouldbe segregated.Overview of the Issues and NIJSurvey ResultsMost correctional administrators feel strongly thateducation and training are not options but absoluterequirements. Indeed, virtually all jurisdictions re-sponding to the third annual NIJ survey currently offeror are developing some AIDS training or educationalmaterial for staff (97 percent) and inmates (96 percent).All federal/state systems in the United States are pro-viding staff and inmate education programs. All Cana-dian systems provide education for staff and all butone also do so for inmates. Figures 3.1 and 3.2 showthe number and percentage of responding correctionalsystems using the major modes of AIDS training forstaff and inmateslive training, audio-visual pro-grams, and distribution of written materials as of thefirst NIJ survey in 1985 and the third annual surveyin 1987. The increase in AIDS educational effortsacross the board is striking. The increases in the pro-portion of systems providing live training are mostnotable since, as will be discussed below, this is themost important, but also the most costly, mode oftraining.It is probably more difficult for jail systems to pro-vide inmate training because of the high turnover ratesin those institutions. In previous NIJ surveys, fewerjail systems were providing inmate AIDS education (73percent in 1985). It is noteworthy that inmate edu-cation is now provided in almost all jail systems.However, as Figure 3.2 shows, they are still somewhatbehind federal/state systems in providing live inmatetraining (88 percent to 67 percent). Education andtraining may be more important where turnover ishigh, because each inmate may come into contact withmany other individuals in a relatively short period oftime. Moreover, inmate training on AIDS serves im-portant public health objectives, particularly whereturnover is high and individuals quickly return to thegreater society.daRegardless of turnover rates, however, training of in-mates also serves important correctional managementpurposes such as promoting institutional security,reducing medical care costs, and limiting potential legalliability. To this effect, the Massachusetts Sheriffs'Association Task Force on AIDS in County Correc-tional Facilities has recommended AIDS education forstaff and inmates in all Massachusetts county jails.1The New York City and San Francisco jail systemshave also developed extensive AIDS education pro-grams for inmates.Education and training are particularly necessarybecause of the prevalence of misinformation on AIDS.While there may finally be less fear among inmatesand staff that HIV is transmissable by truly \"casual\"contact, there is still widespread misunderstanding ofthe ways in which the virus is actually transmitted.More than one-half of responding correctional systemsnoted that staff concern regarding AIDS had increasedin the past year, while 34 percent reported stable levelsof concern and only 8 percent said that concern amongstaff had declined.Staff perceive their contact with inmates to be morethan \"casual\" and therefore still worry about beinginfected on the job. Correctional officers are especiallyconcerned about being infected when aggressive in-mates bite them, spit in their faces, throw urine or feceson them, or jab them with sharp instruments. Suchincidents are not uncommon in correctional facilities.Staff are also concerned about the risks involved inbreaking up fights among inmates and providing CPRand other first aid to inmates. Correctional staff aremost troubled by the thought that they could contractHIV infection and transmit it to their families. Someof the specific incidents of concern to corr( : tionalstaff such as biting, spitting, and urine-, .owingincidentshave not been associated with even a singlecase of HIV infection. Others, such as needlesticks andblood-to-open-wound/mucous membrane contact, infact have resulted in infections, but only to tiny frac-tions (well under 1 percent) of persons documented tohave experienced such exposures (see Chapter One).Concerns about exposure to HIV have led staff insome jurisdictions to refuse to work in medical or non-medical units housing inmates with AIDS or ARC, todemand tint all inmates be tested for antibody to HIV,and to call for restrictions on the work assignmentsof inmates (e.g., no food service assignments) in allthree AIDS-related categories. In some jurisdictions, Education and Training39 Figure 3.1MODES OF AIDS TRAINING PRESENTATION FOR STAFF Modes ofState/Federal PH, ,n Systems City/County Jail programs in operation and under development. Figure 3.2MODES OF AIDS TRAINING PRESENTATION FOR INMATES State/Federal Prison Programs in operation and under development.correctional officers' unions have filed grievances andthreatened strikes over the AIDS issue. Other reactionsinclude staff calls for reduced working hours andhazardous duty pay. (See Chapter Six for a discussionof labor relations issues.)Of the correctional systems responding to the NIJquestionnaire, 40 percent reported that inmate concernabout AIDS had increased since 1986, and 47 percentsaid that levels of inmate concern had remained thesame; only 9 percent reported declining levels of con-cern. Some inmates have reacted to the problem bydemanding HIV antibody testing of all inmates, refus-ing to take work assignments involving contact withHIV-infected inmates or their belongings (e.g., as 40AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES -hospital porters or laundry workers), demanding thatseropositive inmates or homosexual inmates be exclud-ed from food service assignments, and calling forsegregation of all high-risk inmates. New York stateprisons have encountered some resistance from in-mates to being housed in cells just vacated by personssuspected of having AIDS. There have also been in-stances of threats and p^tual violence a lainst inmateswith AIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HI V infection. Afemale inmate in Massachusetts notes that tla fe:: fAIDS has driven inmates apart and increased tensionsin the institution.2Such reactions among staff and inmates reflect seriousmisunderstanding of the documented means of AIDS 54 transmission. Education and training programs maybe able to counteract misinformation and rumors bycarefully marshalling accurate information.Effects of Education and Training onInmates and StaffNIJ survey results show that inmates' concern aboutAIDS is not decreasing in most correctional systems.However, inmates in many correctional facilities showa growing receptiveness to AIDS education. In thepast, inmates who attended AIDS classes were oftenstigmatized as gay by their peers. Now, inmate interestin the topicis broader and more apparent. InDecember 1987, 200 of the 544 inmates (more than 40percent) at a New York state maximum security facilitysigned up for voluntary AIDS education. Indeed, insome jurisdictions, the inmates are more receptive thanstaff to AIDS training and education. Howe-..er, somecorrectional systems still encounter problems with in-mates hesitating to ask questions for fear of beinglabelled as a member of a risk group. This underscoresthe importance of trainers making themselves availablefor questions after training sessions. Or, in the interestof inmate anonymity, trainers might ask inmates tosubmit their questions in writing, which the trainer cananswer without reference to individuals.Still, opinions differ on tie effectiveness of AIDSeducation. While New York state officials report thathomosexuality among inmates has become moremonogamous, some other jurisdictions report thathigh-risk behavior, especially needle-sharing, has in-creased in spite of education. Such systems requestincreased drug-treatment capability and improvedtraining on IV drug use-associated AIDS. Somesystems perceive intravenous drug use and homosex-uality among inmates to be as prevalent now as theywere before the AIDS problem. An official in onecorrectionalfacility notes that \"guys with longsentences don't care\" enough about the risk oftransmission to change their risky behavior.Despite these mixed reviews on the effectiveness of in-mate AIDS education, systems must persist in their ef-forts to provide this critical information. There isevidence from the world outside correctional facilitiesthat gay men and even IV drug users are reducing oreliminating high-risk behaviors out of concern aboutAIDS.3As noted above, concern about AIDS among correc-tional staff has not markedly declined in most jurisdic-tions. However, examples of successful staff trainingand education efforts abound. Several years ago inNew York City, a threatened walkout by correctionalofficers over the presence of inmates with AIDS wasaverted by a carefully designed education program. Infact, New York City correctional officials believe thattheir training program has \"put the AIDS hysteriato rest.\"In New Jersey,timely educational efforts alsoprevented a threatened job action by the correctionalofficers' union and led staff to reverse an earlier refusalto transport inmates with AIDS. In another state, aunion grievance was filed demanding that inmates betested for antibodies to HIV before they could beassigned to work in food service. This dispute was alsosatisfactorily resolved through educational effortswithout instituting a testing program. Arizona reportsthat correctional institutions with the most intensivetraining and education programs have the fewestproblems with acceptance of inmates with AIDS,ARC, and asymptomatic HIV infection. Texas alsoreports that there have been no major conflicts regar-ding the presence of inmates with AIDS and ARC inprison units where education and training were pro-vided on a timely basis.At New York state's Sing Sing prison, there are nowmore applicants than positions for staff on the facili-ty's AIDS unit. This is evidence that AIDS educationthere has helped change staff attitudes towards deal-ing with infected inmates. A similar attitude prevailsat the Vacaville, California facility, where there arealso more applicants than positions for staff on theAIDS unit. Correctional officers there take pride inbeing educated professionals who understand the ex-tremely low risk of becoming infected on the job.While this reported experience is encouraging, it is stillimportant to point out that the effectiveness of trainingand education depends on programs being planned anddeveloped with sensitivity to both the rational andirrational fears of all affected groups. A poorly de-signed education program may simply draw attentionto the problem without allaying the concerns of staffand inmates.Although the vast majority of correctional ad-ministrators agree that it is important to provideeducation: on AIDS for staff and inmates, there area few who believe that these programs may be counter-productive. In one California county, for example,policymakers resisted instituting inmate education onAIDS because they believe it \"would most likely causepanic.\" Similarly, the superintendent of a New Yorkfacility explains that no live training is provided forinmates because it might inflame their fears and in-crease hostilities. Several other respondents note thatstaff educational programs on AIDS may be ineffec-53Education and Training 41 tive because correctional officers are suspicious of anyinformation coming from government agencies. Still,available evidence overwhelmingly supports the impor-tance and potential effectiveness of education andtraining on AIDS for staff and inmates.High-quality AIDS training and education are expen-sive. But the investment is worthwhile. A well-educatedstaff is more efficient and a well-educated inmatepopulation is less likely to be disruptive when AIDS-related issues arise. In addition, iomate training, if itcan prevent HIV trap: mission, may ultimately save thesystem the costs of caring for inmates with AIDS. Thekey elements of training and education programs forcorrectional inmates and staff are discussed below.Key Elements of Education andTraining Programs for Inmatesand StaffMost correctional systems provide staff and inmateswith some general training or informational materialson AIDS and the means of transmission of HIV. Inaddition, staff and inmates may both receive morespecialized training and information: staff trainingusually emphasizes ways to reduce risk during contactwith inmates, while inmate training typically stressesavoiding behaviors such as sexual activities and needle-sharing that may result in transmission of the AIDSvirus. (Examples of training curricula for inmates andstaff are presented in Appendix D.) While the contentof much of the general information on AIDS presentedto staff and inmates is usually very similar, trainingsessions for the two groups are always conductedseparately. individual counseling of persons before andafter HIV antibody .esting and for persons found tobe infected is also an important part of an AIDSeducation program. This counseling is discussed inChapter Five.Timely Education and TrainingExperience suggests that it is important to plan andinstitute educational programs on AIDS as early aspossiblepreferably before the first case is identifiedor before serious concerns surface among inmates orstaff. Some physicians suggest that fear concerningtransmissi\"n of HIV is greatest where there is the leastactual experience with AIDS cases. Ideally, AIDStraining and education for staff should be providedbefore staff develop unsubstantiated fears regardingthe disease. Instruction on AIDS should be includedin both staff recruit training and inmate orientation.Survey results reveal that 82 percent of state andfederal systems, but only 52 percent of responding 42 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIEScity and county systems and 50 percent of Canadiansystems, provide (or are developing) live trainingprograms on AIDS as part of the initial training ofnew employees.Sixty-nine percent of federal and state systems, butonly 24 percent of responding city and county systemsand 33 percent of Canadian systems, provide (or aredeveloping) live training on AIDS to all inmates atintake. Many more systems provide written matenatson AIDS to inmates at intake.Regular Education and TrainingTraining and education should also be presented to in-mates and staff at regular intervals after intake orcommencement of employment. Over half of state andfederal, city and county, and Canadian systems pro-vide live AIDS training to inmates at various intervalsduring their incarceration. Three-fourths of state andfederal systems, city and county, and Canadiansystems provide live in-service training on AIDS tostaff.The frequency with which education is presenteddepends on the mode of presentation. Pamphlets andbrochures may be distributed or made available almostcontinuously during incarceration or employment. Inmost cases, live training sessions are only held everyfew months or as infrequently as every year, dependingon the size of the system and the perceived need fortraining. However, it is important to provkie informa-tion as regularly as possible. Without hequent dosesof accurate information, misinformed fear will quicklyreassert itself.Because of the changing nature of the AIDS situation,itis important to present updates on any newdevelopments and to offer accurate and timely infor-mation to counteract unfounded rumors. Over 40 per-cent of state/federal systems in the United States haveexpanded and/or updated the content of their inmateAIDS training in the last year, while 39 percent ofresponding city/county systems and half of the Cana-dian systems have done so. The equivalent percentagesfor systems which have updated and/or expaaded stafftraining content in the last year are 45 percent, 35 per-cent, and 25 percent. These represent significantpercentages of correctional systems but, in fact, illsystems should expand or at least update the contentof their AIDS education programs each year.All correctional systems should assign someone to stayabreast of the latest developments on AIDS and toformulate a quick and appropriate response whennecessary, as certain systems have done. For example, in May 1987, the media reported an incomplete andalarming siory about three health care workers whobecame infected with HIV after contact with the bloodof infected patients. Many accounts failed to reportor emphasize that all three cases involved direct blood-to-blood or blood-to-mucous membrane contact (longknown as a means of HIV transmission) and that allthree health-care workers had failed to follow recom-mended infection control procedures when the in-cidents occurred. The press rerorts of these health-careworker cases caused great concern among correctionaland law enforcement personnel. Many correctionalsystems responded to the situation immediately.California's correctional department distributed copiesof the Centers for Disease Control's Morbidity andMortality Weekly Report, which contained full andfactual accounts of the cases, to the correctional of-ficers' union for inclusion in its newsletter. At allMaryland institutions, medical directors presented thefacts of the cases at roll call. The Illinois Departmentof Corrections' medical director sent a memorandumto all their health care workers, in which he summa-rized the CDC report and clearly laid out the facts.These proactive responses to the media's coveragehelped to calm staff members' concerns.New York State's Department of Correctional Servicesalso takes a proactive stance on AIDS education forstaff. The department's Communicable and InfectiousDiseases Coordinator holds small, focused trainingand education sessions at various institutions on re-quest. In the past, these have included a meeting withcorrectional officers' unions when Sing Sing openedits AIDS unit and crisis management sessions withtransportation officers.AIDS education just prior to inmate release may alsobe extremely useful. Such sessions provide oppor-tunities to make inmates fully aware of the risks andresponsibilities they will face as they return to thecommunity at large, with its broader range of personalfreedoms and choices regarding sexual activities, drugabuse and other potentially dangerous behavior. Cur-rently, however, only 16 percent of state and federalsystems, 3 percent of responding city and countysystems, and no Canadian systems present AIDS train-ing to inmates at the time of release. This is an areawith much room for improvement.Mandatory Education and TrainingBecause of the importance and relevance of AIDS tocorrectional systems and because of the prevalence ofunreasonable fears and unfounded views regardingtransmission of HIV, all agencies should make staffand inmate training mandatory.In response to the widespread concern about AIDS,some correctional systems have instituted mandatoryeducation programs on the subject for inmates andstaff. Currently, only 35 percent of state/federalsystems, 6 percent of city/county systems, and noCanadian systems make all inmate AIDS training man-datory. However, 71 percent of state/federal systemsmake at least some inmate training on AIDS man-datory. Staff training on AIDS is always mandatoryin 55 percent of state/federal systems, 42 percent ofcity/county systems, and no Canadian systems. How-ever, at least some staff training is mandatory in88 percent of state/federal systems, 67 percent ofcity/county systems, and one-half of Canadiansystems.Current mandatory training generally involves sessionsduring recruit training and/or in-service education.The California Department of Corrections providedtwo hours of mandatory AIDS training to all staff(about 25,000 people) between 1986 and 1987. TheCalifornia correctional system also conducts manda-tory training for recruits and a half-hour's mandatoryrefresher course for correctional staff. Maryland re-quires AIDS training for all new staff and mandatesin-service AIDS sessions. Additionally, the medicaldirector of Maryland's correctional system has donerequired roll-call sessions on AIDS at all of the state'sinstitutions. Maryland also requires AIDS training atleast three times for each inmate: at intake, duringincarceration, and before release. The correctionaldepartment contracted with the Health EducationResources Organization (HERO) to train thirty-sixstaff members, from line correctional officers topsychologists, to be AIDS educators. They have ledboth inmate and staff AIDS sessions. Even some jailsystemsare adopting mandatory training. TheMassachusetts Sheriffs' Association recommended thatthere be mandatory AIDS education for inmates andstaff in all county jails in the state.4Mandatory staff training will probably present prob-lems of logistics and increased cost e.g. the poten-tial need to provide overtime pay or cover the postsor positions of duty staff while they attend training.California spent two million dollars in one year to pro-vide mandatory AIDS training to all staff. However,the importance of the subject. warrants the extra effortand cost required to mcunt such training.It is particularly important to make staff trainingmandatory because there are indications that thosestaff members who are most affected by unsubstan-tiated fears are also the ones most likely to avoidvoluntary training sessions. Some systems discoveredthat correctional staff, despite expressing great con- '''',t.iiEducation and Training 43 cern about AIDS, showed poor attendance at volun-tary training sessions.Officials sometimes oppose mandatory training on thegrounds that unwilling inmate participants will disruptthe sessions. Where such a problem might exist, man-datory sessions of smaller groups or one-to-one ses-sions may be a possible solution.Several systems have instituted innovative approachesto maximizing the audience for inmate education onAIDS. In Minnesota, for example, videotaped train-ing segments on AIDS were the only programs avail-able on institutional closed-circuit television duringcertain time periods. California and other systems planto use closed circuit television systems to present AIDSeducation.Strong Executive and ManagementCommitment to Education and TrainingThe most successful AIDS training and education pro-grams thrive because of their - onagers' commitmentto the programs. Correctional managers who endorseAIDS training help maximize trainer credibility andtrainee receptiveness. it: the Shawangunk (New York)correctional facility, the superintendent or his chiefdeputy introduce all AIDS training sessions, thet4bydemonstrating management's commitment to the pro-gram. At Sing Sing correctional facility, the executivestaff regularly visit the AIDS unit, a practice whichhas helped to reduce the fear of AIDS among otherinmates and staff.Managers can especially help in easing the logisticalproblems posed by large-scale training programs. Byresolving scheduling problems for staff training, suchas by authorizing overtime (if permitted), managementcan ensure that AIDS education reaches as many staffand inmates as regularly as possible.Staff and Inmate Participation inDevelopment of Educational ProgramsEducational programs should be targeted to the iden-tified concerns and informational needs of staff andinmates. Thus, if possible, correctional systems shouldinvolve representatives of the target audiences in thedevelopment of AIDS training.Staff, union, and inmate representatives should par-ticipate in the development of training materials andtraining programs. Their partit, ration can help tocounteract suspicions that department management isusing the training to \"pull the wool aver our eyes.\" Likemany citizens, correctional staff have displayed skep-ticism of the medical community's pronouncements on44 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESAIDS. Therefore, training which simply presentsmedical research as unequivocal fact may not be ef-fective in allaying unsubstantiated fears. Research oncorrectional systems' response to AIDS has found thatsome of the most effective training programs are thosedeveloped jointly by management, staff members,unions, inmate representatives, medical experts, andhealth professionals.Currently, only 26 percent of state/federal systems,12 percent of responding city/county systems, and 8percent of Canadian systems give inmates a direct rolein the development of AIDS educational programs. Bycontrast, almost two-thirds of responding systemsinvolve staff in development of training and educa-tion programs.Effective training should be based on systematic in-formation about concerns and knowledge gaps. Oneway to develop such information is through brief testsof knowledge and perception regarding AIDS. Somestates use these as pre- and post-tests during trainingsessions, but they might be even more effectivelyemployed to inform the initial development andongoing refinement of training programs. (An exam-ple of a pre/post test of AIDS knowledge is includedin Appendix D.)Correctional systems have used various methods to in-volve staff and inmates in the development of AIDSeducation. In South Carolina, staff took questionscommonly posed by correctional officers and basedtheir training on answers to these questions. The NewYork City Department of Corrections solicited specificquestions on AIDS from the entire correctional staffas a first step in developing an extremely effective stafftraining videotape. The questions received were dis-tilled into ten-twenty key questions. The City's Com-missioner of Corrections and Commissioner of Healthwere then brought together to respond to these ques-tions. The discussion was videotaped and edited intoa forty-minute program. Maine's staff unions workedwith their Department of Corrections to develop anAIDS training program. Similarly, in Missouri, anAIDS Policy Implementation Committee, composedof staff from many levels and functions, helped todevelop the AIDS training curriculum.Inmate participation in the development of AIDSeducation programs can also be extremely useful.Oregon has revised its inmate education program basedon inmate evaluations. The state is considering usinginmate focus groups and inmate resource persons forfuture program development. In a South Carolinafacility, the staff held a joint educational planning ses-sion on AIDS with an inmate advisory council. _t New York City prepared an inmate videotape from adiscussion between the Director of Montefiore MedicalCenter-Rikers Island Health Services (a unit which pro-vides 85 percent of all medical and mental health careservices to inmates of the New York City correctionalsystem) and the heads of eighteen inmate councils frominstitutions across the city. This was a spontaneousquestion-and-answer session on AIDS, during whichthe inmate representatives were able to pose any ques-tions they wished. New York City also employed in-mate focus groups in developing other aspects of itsAIDS education program. The Correctional Servicesof Canada has texorporated concerns raised by inmatecommittees into its AIDS training.Live Education and TrainingLive training on AIDS lectures, seminars, discussiongroups, question-and-answer sessions and other pro-grams involving live trainers is the most effectiveformat, because it provides staff members and inmatesthe opportunity to raise their own specific questionsand concerns and to receive responses from peoplewho are knowledgeable about the epidemiology andmeans of transmission of HIV infection and AIDS,and able to answer questions clearly and effectively.Officials of the New York City Department of Cor-rections, who have extensive experience dealing withthe AIDS problem, argue strongly that passive educa-floral programs (such as printed materials, videotapes,or slide-tape shows) are by themselves not enough.They firmly believe that it is important to have livetraining sessions with trainers who are knowledgeableabout the issues, sensitive to the concerns of all groups,and who are able to answer questions on the spot. NewYork City does not simply show its videotaped pro-grams to staff and inmates; it supplements thevideotapes with live question-and-answer periods.Eighty-two percent of all responding jurisdictions nowprovide (or are developing) live training on AIDS toinmates, while 95 percent provide (or are developing)live training for staff. State/federal systems andsystems which have experienced more inmate cases ofAIDS are most likely to provide live training. Onlytwo-thirds of jurisdictions which report no inmatecases provide live inmate training, as opposed to 100percent of jurisdictions which have had more thantwenty-five cases. These findings point to the need fortimely live trainingthat is, training provided in ad-vance of the first active case of AIDS in an effortto \"head off\" misinformation and fear.Jurisdictions providing live training allocate, onaverage, 55 percent of each inmate session, and 41 per-cent of each staff session, to questions and answers.It is very important to allow sufficient time for theaudience to ask, and receive answers, to its questions.Having insufficient time for questions may defeat thepurpose of the training, by sending the audience awayfrustrated and/or feeling that the correctional systemis not willing to address individuals' concerns in aforthright manner.Variations in mode of presentation exist not onlyacross, but also within correctional systems' trainingprograms. In 1` zw York state, there is no absolute re-quirement for live training. Only distribution ofbrochures is mandatory in the state; other forms ofeducation are left to the discretion of each institution'ssuperintendent. Rhode Island has found that smallgroup and one-on-one discussions, as alternatives totraditional classroom instruction, are helpful ineducating inmates and staff. A workshop format hasbeen used in staff training in several systems. NationalCapit A Systems, Inc. (NCSI), under contract with theNational Institute on Drug Abuse, offered workshopsdesigned to address staff skepticism and perceivedpowerlessness regarding AIDS. The group exercisesinvolved soliciting potential transmission incidentsfrom staff and walking them through an \"anatomy ofAIDS transmission risk.\" In these workshops, leadersdismissed no situation as too farfetched and made noassessment until the group determined a final level ofrisk. Participants evaluated relative risks and decidedwhich situations presented real risk and which did not,increasing the staff's sense of control. Discussing andassessing specific risk reduction strategies helpedparticipants to develop \"a concrete sense of the`cloability' of prevention.\"5 NCSI has also developedan \"AIDS virus transmission scorecard\" to assess par-ticular incidents and behaviors of concern to correc-tional staff.AIDS training and education may thus vary with theaudience size, training facilities, and perceived au-dience receptiveness of individual institutions withinthe same system. Some institutional managers favorlive training, while othersanticipating heightenedfears or disruptionoppose it. Live training is expen-sive and may raise troubling issues. However, its ad-vantages strongly outweigh its drawbacks. All facilitiesin all systems should provide live training on AIDSfor staff and inmates.Other Modes of PresentationVideotapes and Other Audio-VisualsAs noted above, videotapes and other audio-visualscan be useful elements of an AIDS training program.However, they should not be the only element of theprogram. Eighty-nine percent of responding jurisidic-53Education and Training45 tions incorporate videotapes into staff AIDS training,while 84 percent use them in inmate training.Numerous videotapes and slide-tape presentations areavailable. The National Institute of Corrections (NIC)prepared a videotape from a CDC presentation on thebasic facts regarding AIDS and distributed the tapeto all state correctional departments. The AmericanCorrectional Association has produced AIDSvideotapes for staff and inmates. Individual states andjurisdictions, including New York City, have alsomade videotapes of their ownshowing staff, inmates,and physicians discussing their concerns regardingAIDS. (A listing of available audio-visual materialsand ways to obtain them is included in the ResourceList in Appendix A.)Two audio-visual programs deserve special mention.\"AIDSA Bad Way to Die\" is a videotape producedby and for correctional inmates. It is an extremely ef-fective presentation, based on extensive interviews withAIDS patients in the New York state correctionalsystem. It shows the effects of AIDS in graphic detailand offers dramatic words of warning from inmatessuffering from the disease.6 Many correctional systemsshow this videotape as part of their live training ses-sions and rate it very highly. However, several systemsnote that the videotape is too long and have edited itdown to focus on the inmates' statements, the mostaffecting part of the presentation.Several correctional systems have complained of thelack of an effective videotape aimed at women's con-cerns. \"Dying for Love\" may fill the need. While notdeveloped expressly for correctional audiences, it ad-dresses all of the major issues of particular concernto women, including negotiation with partners regard-ing condom use, pregnancy and the risk of transmit-ting HIV to one's fetus or infant. This videotape hasbeen used to good effect in the San Francisco women'sjail.Other commonly shown videotapes include:\"Sex, Drugs, and AIDS\" ofPrisons); and\"AIDS Staff\" (Federal Bureau ofPrisons). 46 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESMany systems use more than one videotape, showingboth a locally produced and a national videotape. orperhaps alternating between them.Canadian correctional systems all use AIDS videotapesfor inmates and/or staff. These range from privatelymade films, such as \"AIDS Alert\" (Kenetic Industries)to federally such as \"AIDS\" (Correc-tional Services of Canada).Written MaterialsOver 90 percent of correctional systems furnish writ-ten materials on AIDS to inmates, while 75 percentdistribute such materials to staff. Like audio-visuals,written materials can be a good supplement to, butshould not substitute for, live training.Brochures and Posters. Most institutions distributeAIDS brochures or information sheets to inmates atintake, during their incarceration, and/or beforerelease. Staff typically receive materials at hiring. Somesystems have created their own materials, but manyrely at least partly on publications from other s \"urces,such as national, state, or local public health agencies,the American Red Cross, and local AIDS advocacyprojects. Good written materials present the facts andprecautions regarding transmission, while emphasiz-ing to inmates and staff that \"AIDS is hard to get.\"Currently, specialized brochures on AIDS exist for vir-tually every kind of audience likely to be in correctionalinstitutions, from intravenous drug abusers to gay mento pregnant women. Spanish-language versions of in-formational materials and training curricula have beendeveloped in Florida and other jurisdictions.California is employing yet another innovative mediumfor AIDS educationposters, designed by and forinmates. In particular, an asymptomatically infectedinmate at Vacaville has drawn numerous striking AIDSposters, many of which address specific inmate issues,such as tattooing. The institutions display these andother AIDS prevention posters in various locations,such as living areas, medical units, and staff areas.(Several of these posters are included in Appendix D.)Each of California's correctional institutions has ap-pointed an AIDS materials coordinator to distributematerials and enure that posters are displayed.California's system also places AIDS informationbrochures in family visit units.New York City distributes AIDS information kits toall inmates prior to their release. These kits includebrochures, AIDS hotline cards, and condoms. (Forexamples of well-conceived written materials and Go posters currently being distributed in correctionalfacilities, see Appendix D.)Inmate and Staff Publications. Commonly employedmedia for education on AIDS include inmate new3-papers, staff newsletters, and union publications. InConnecticut, Illinois, and other jurisdictions, correc-tional medical directors have solicited inmates' ques-tions on AIDS and published written responses ininmate newspapers. These questions and answers coverbasic information on AIDS and present practicalguidance for preventing transmission ci. the AIDSvirus within the institution.From Questions and Answers on AIDS inan Illinois inmate newspaper(answers prepared by the state's correc-tional medical director):?Question:What can inmates do to eliminate thepossibility of getting AIDS?Answer:The only way to eliminate the . is shar-ing needles [drugortattooing] with otherinmates. If inmates avoid these two things,it is virtually impossible for them to getAIDS.Simple and Straightforward MessagesRegardless of the medium, experience suggests that allmaterials and presentations be in clear, simple, layper-son's language which inmates and staff will under-stand. Inmate materials should assume a low level ofliteracy and, therefore, avoid technical language.Where terms such as \"condoms\" and \"needles\" (sy-ringes) are used, they should also be defined in popularjargon, that is, \"rubbers\" and \"works\".Experience suggests that presentations be kept brief,but there should be flexibility depending on the levelof interest shown by the audiences. Maryland usuallylimits inmate live training sessions to thirty minutesin order to keep them manageable and to allow ampleopportunity for inmates to ask questions. Most stafftraining sessions appear to be about one hour long.All educational programs should emphasize key prac-tical advice, rather than present complex discussionsof the epidemiology of AIDS. Question-and-answerformats like those discussed earlier can be very effec-tive if they are based on a relatively small number ofkey questions- -e.g., \"How is HIV transmitted?\", HIV through casual contactwith another person?\", and \"What can I do to avoidHIV infection in the correctional institution?\"CredibilityCorrectional administrators stress that perhaps themost important quality of a successful training andeducation program on AIDS is credibility. Withoutcredibility, a training program may be worse thanuseless.All information presented should bestraightforward and honest. Any misrepresentation ofthe truth may totally undermine the effectiveness ofan educational program. To overcome skepticism thatinmates and staff are being given different stories onAIDS, several correctional systems, including NewJersey's, have staff representatives attend inmate train-ing sessions and inmate representatives attend staffsessions.One state encountered suspicion from some of its cor-rectional officers that training and issuance of gloveswere merely correctional department ploys to avoidliability should a staff member become infected withthe virus. This type of skepticism can b eased ifmanagement is consistently accurate and clear aboutthe facts. Withholding information for example,evidence that open-wound and mucous membrane con-tactcanlead to infection may backfire when peopleobtain the correct information elsewhere. Given thetensions that already exist in a correctional setting,credibility must be maintained through consistency andopen communication.Knowledgeable and Approachable Trainersand PresentersSixty-nine percent of state/federal systems, but only30 percent of responding city/county systems and 42percent of Canadian systems, use medical experts ininmate AIDS training, whereas at least 70 percent ofall types of correctional systems use such experts forstaff training. Credibility is very important for bothaudiences, so knowledgeable trainers should be usedfor both inmate and staff sessions. It is extremelyhelpful to have a physician present, at least during partof the session, to answer medical questions.In general, trainers who establish a good rapport withtheir audience are more likely to make an impact withtheir instruction. In site visits to the San FranciscoCounty Jail and the Maryland Correctional Institutionfor Women at Jessup, we observed trainers who im-mediately established a rapport with women inmateaudiences and received plentiful and candid questions r 1Education and Training47 from the inmates. Methods of establishing rapport willvary with audience and institution. However, it maybe helpful for trainers to call on inmates or staff byname, pace the session for each audience, speak theaudience's language, and generally be trustworthy andapproachable. All questions should be answered direct-ly, clearly, and completely.Outside speakers for example, from the public healthdepartment or from the private sector may some-times be more credible to inmates and staff thanpresenters from the correctional department. Ofcourse, this will depend on history and attitudes in eachcorrectional institution. Correctional administratorsshould consider all of these factors about trainers andpresenters as they plan and develop their own train-ing programs.Standardized ProgramsStandardizing AIDS education and training programsis a form of quality control which may help developcredibility. In New York State, considerable variationin training exists across institutions. However, the cor-rectional department is working with the Departmentof Health's AIDS Institute to maximize the consis-tency of the training provided. Institute stalt travel tocorrectional facilities at the request of the superinten-dent and conduct training for staff in the morning andinmates in the afternoon. The sessions are virtuallyidentical. This way, the Institute avoids presenting con-tradictory information that could undermine credibili-ty. The Correctional Services of Canada is currentlydeveloping a standard AIDS curriculum for all ofCanada.Materials Prepared by NationalOrganizationsWhile many jurisdictions have prepared their owntraining materials, several state administrators believethat materials prepared by national organizations maybe more credible than locally prepared materials. Theyfeel that the correctional department may be perceivedas having \"an axe to grind\" or something tc hide,whereas a national organization may be viewed asmore objective in its approach to the problem. Again,these decisions must be based on a careful assessmentof attitudes in each correctional system. About one-half of responding correctional systems rely entirelyon written materials for inmates developed by others,while about one-third depend on outside writtenmaterials for staff. 48 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESUse of Training Teams and Peer TrainersInvolving inmates in the delivery of inmate trainingand staff in the presentation of staff training may im-prove the program's credibility and trainers' rapportwith their audiences. However, relatively few systemsuse staff representatives to present training (41 percentin state/federal systems, 36 percent in respondingcity/county systems, and 33 percent in Canadiansystems) and very few use inmate representatives (2percentinstate/federal systems,3 percentincity/county systems, and 8 percent in Canadiansystems). Correctional administrators may wish toconsider this training option.A few correctional systems presently use inmates withgood results, to present formal training. At theCalifornia Correctional Medical Facility at Vacaville(a reception, medical, and pre-release center whichhouses all of the California Department of Correc-tions' inmates with AIDS, ARC, and asymptomaticHIV infection), plans are underway to set up an AIDSInformation Center, complete with an inmate-staffedhotline (on the internal telephone system). Moreover,at Vacaville, two inmates one with asymptomaticHIV infection and one with full-blown AIDS assistwith the training of other inmates in the medical, pre-release, and reception components of the facility.These inmates present a personal perspective onAIDSe.g., how I became infected and how it feelswhich injects credibility and realism into the program.Their participation also serves as important therapyfor the two inmate trainers themselves. One of theseinmates commented, \"At first, [pa-'icipating in thetraining] was just a way to get away from the unit.Now, I'm really committed to it. Jt can really makea difference. It's all I have to live for.\" The otherinmate participates in live training sessions and designsAIDS prevention posters which are prominently placedaround the facility. Inmate trainers report that, afterinitial suspicion, their audience responded very posi-tively to peer training, ending sessions with hand-shakes, hugs, and other expressions of empathy andgratitude for the peer trainers.Even if inmates are not used in formal training, theymay be effectively involved in informal educational ef-forts. For example, New York state's correctional of-ficials deliberately sought to meet with inmate groupleaders and provide them with information on AIDSwhich they could convey to their group members.A word of caution regarding the use of inmates in anyAIDS education efforts: to avoid undermining the 1111.11110111111111V credibility of the whole program, the peer trainers mustbe knowledgeable and present consistent information.Correctional systems may wish to consider trainingteams. These may be more effective than single trainersin presenting AIDS educational sessions, because ofthe range of issues and questions that may arise andthe need to maintain credibility for all groups. Train-ing teams for both inmates and staff should includeknowledgeable medical professionals, because layper-sons are less credible in responding to technical medicalquestions that are likely to arise. in addition, inmatetraining teams should include an inmate spokesperson,and staff training teams should include a staffmember. These representatives can respond to morepractical issues and provide assurance that the train-ing program is a cooperative effort to present accurate,fair, and reasonable approaches to the problem ratherthan an attempt by the system to mislead inmates orstaff. Several states and jurisdictions have had successusing such training teams to present AIDS educationalsessions.Avoiding Extremes of Alarmism andComplacencyStaff and inmate education programs on AIDS mustcarefully avoid extremes of both alarmism and com-placency. An alarmist tone may evoke undue fear,while a complacent tone may fail to encourage theappropriate level of care and caution. The plain factsare that a few well-defined types of exposures andbehaviors must be of concern to everyone and that thisconcern should affect relationships with everyone. Inshort, \"AIDS is not a disease of high-risk groups, butof high-risk behaviors.\" However, far too many peopletake the converse and potentially very dangerousposition that the AIDS virus may be transmitted bymany types of contactincluding casual contactbutthat the only persons to be concerned about aremembers of \"high-risk\" groups.It may be alarmist to require or recommend that staffwear gloves, gowns, and masks for all contact withpersons known or suspected to be infected with theAIDS virus, or persons thought to be in AIDS \"high-risk\" groups. Such precautions are not normallynecessary unless contact with blood or body fluids islikely to occur. Requirements that protective clothingbe worn for all contacts may encourage the incorrectview that HIV can be transmitted by casual contact.On the other hand, statements which complacentlysuggest that risk is limited to certain groups mayseriously undermine the critical educational messagethat everyone must be careful about certain behaviorsand exposures. While unsubstantiated fear is counter-productive, concern and caution are essential for all.Correctional staff and inmates must adopt \"universalprecautions\". That is, they must avoid unprotectedcontact with the blood or body fluids of anyonewhether or not they say they have AIDS, appear tobe ill, or seem to be in an AIDS \"high-risk\" group.If the tone of AIDS training programs is not properlybalanced between caution and reassurance, these pro-grams may encourage misinformed beliefs which couldadversely affect the security of correctional facilities.Training Keyed to Specific Concerns ofCorrectional AudiencesAfter presenting some basic medical information onthe disease, training programs on AIDS should berelated specifically to correctional situations. Specificcontent will, of course, depend on the specific dutiesand concerns of the audience, but strictly genericmaterials are insufficient. Key educational and actionmessages that ought to be conveyed in regard to someof the specific concerns of correctional audiences aresummarized in Figure 3.3. Topics covered in the train-ing should be relevant to the situation of the audience.For example, if alternative test sites are not availableto inmates, the trainer should not discuss them.Several jurisdictions, including New York state, havedeveloped their awn question-and-answer brochuresspecifically for correctional officers. New York's isbased on \"questions about AIDS asked most often byemployees of the ... Departmentof Correctional Ser-vices.\"8 Other jurisdictions have tailored generic AIDSbrochures produced by public health agencies to cor-rectional audiences. Quer ,ion- and - answer segmentshave been added, deleted, or rephrased to make thematerial more relevant to the correctional setting. Forexample, an additional question mie,t be: \"Can I catchAIDS if I share a cell with a person who has AIDS?\"In many of these brochures the language has beensimplified, and preventive measures have been des-cribed in colloquial terms more readily understandableto correctional audiences.Staff training and education can address the increas-ingly prevalent problem of inmates using AIDS asa threat. For example, an inmate might say to anofficer, \"I have AIDS, and I'll spit at you if you don't\" In such situations, the educated correctionalofficer will know that he has nothing to fear, sincespitting poses a negligible risk in transmitting HIV.Education can thus \"unload the gun\" of inmate threats. 6 3Education and Training49 Figure 3.3APPROPRIATE EDUCATIONAL AND ACTION MESSAGES TO ADDRESS AIDS-RELATED CONCERNSOF CORRECTIONAL PERSONNEL Issue/Concern Educational and Action MessagesHuman Bites Spitting/Urine Feces Cuts/puncture wounds CPR/first aid Body removal Casual contactAny contact with bloodor body fluids Persistence of HIV indried bloodPerson who bites is typically the one who gets the blood; viral transmis-sion through saliva is highly unlikely.

Once dead,it is permanently dead; it cannot be brought back to life by rehydration.Laboratory studies showing persistence of AIDS virus for 3 days in driedblood sample used viral preparation 100,000 times more concentratedthan found in normal blood samples. Not intended to show what happensin real world. According to NIJ survey responses, inmate trainingin one-half of the state systems and almost two-thirdsof responding city/county systems includes guidelinesfor \"safer sex \"specifically, the use of condoms.Training in 20 percent of state systems and almost halfof responding city/county systems also includes infor-mation on cleaning needles. Both of these topics arecontroversial because they refer to behaviors pro-hibited in (and, in the case of IV drug use, outside of)prison.Correctional systems should advocateabstinence from these practices as the safest approach,but realism suggests that not all inmates will be ableor willing to abstain. Therefore, systems not alreadydoing so might wish to consider presenting practicalpreventive measures for these inmates. (The issue ofcondom distribution in correctional facilities is dis-cussed in Chapter Five.) 50AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESContent of AIDS Education and TrainingAs noted earlier, inmate and staff education programsshould cover basic information on the causes andtransmission of AIDS debunking myths and un-founded rumors and present practical, understand-able guidance for preventing transmission and acquisi-tion of the AIDS virus. We present some examplesbelow of well-conceived inmate and staff educationalmaterials. (Several lesson plans for inmate and stafftraining are included in Appendix D.)Examples of Inmate Education/TrainingInmate training and educational materials almostalways include discussion of sexual and needle-sharingpractices likely to result in transmission of the AIDSvirus. Materials should also emphasize the respon-sibilities of all inmates regarding all types of sexual 6 ei activity and other potentially dangerous behavior. Itis important for training to stress the practical precau-tions that everyone should take. The following excerptseffectively present key information:From a Texas inmate training curriculum:9How can the virus be transmittKl?We now know that the virus is found in mostbody fluidsblood, semen, vaginal secretionsfrom women, saliva, tears, cerebrospinalfluid, amniotic fluid, urine, and breast milk.However, it appears that it depends on theconcentrationon how much virusispresent before the virus can be transmitted.The evidence is that the virus is transmittedonlythrough blood, semen, vaginal secre-tions, and possibly through breast milk.How does the virus enter the body?1. Sexual Contact.Having sexual contact withan infected person, penis-vagina, penis-rectum, penis-mouth, mouth-vagina,mouth-rectum. Transmission can takeplace between a man a woman or be-tween two men .... Anal intercourseisthe most dangerous behavior, because thepenis can cause invisible tears in the rec-tum, allowing the virus to enter directlyinto the bloodstream. The same thing canhappen in the vagina. The virus can bepassed from penis to rectum or vagina orvice versa.Although male homosexuals or bisexualsnow have almost 70 percent of the cases ofAIDS, it is expected that this percentagewill decrease as heterosexual transmissionsincrease. Infection results from a sexualrelationship with an infected person. Themore sexual partners you have, the greateris the risk of infection.2.Blood contamination.This happens wheninfected blood getsdirectly into thebloodstream. The most common way in theUnited States is the sharing of needles forIV drug abuse. Blood transfusions beforeMay 15, 1985, were sometimes infected,but the chance of infection is very smallnow. Tattoo needles have transmitted theAIDS virus, and transmission mightpossibly occur by sharing razors ortoothbrushes with an infected person. Thisis because of the risk of blood being on thetattoo needle, the razor, or the toothbrush.The virus could enter the bloodstream if theblood of an infected person came in con-tact with a cut or with an open sore, or raw,chapped skin.Inallinstances,thesetransmissions would involve direct blood-to-blood contact. The virus may also betransmitted through mucous membraneslining the mouth and nose and through theeyes.3.Mother to child.A woman who is infectedwith the AIDS virus may transmit the virusto her baby during pregnancy or childbirth. It is also possible that it can betransmitted to a baby through breast-feeding.From a Florida inmate training cur-riculum:19Responsibility for not contracting AIDS restswith you, the inmate, as an individualhomosexuality and IV drug use are personalchoices.THE CHui...13 IS YOURS TO BEHEALTHY OR ILL.IT'S ALL UP TO YOU!New York State's AIDS Institute conveys similarlysharp messages about individual responsibility regard-ing infection. In essence, the trainers say that peoplecontrol theirownrisk of infection, that AIDS isbehavior-bound and therefore 100 percent prevent-able what you do, not who you are, determineswhether or not you contract the virus.Training programs should avoid stating or implyingthat members of certain groups are at risk and thatall other people are basically \"safe\". This might createa false sense of security which could undermine thebehavioral circumspectionthat everyone shouldpractice.However, inmate training should also stress that theAIDS virus is not transmitted by casual contact or nor-mal health-care procedures and that the correctionalsystem is taking reasonable and prudent steps to pre-vent spread of the disease. The following excerpts ef-fectively convey these messages:From a Georgia inmate training cur-riculum:11Even afterallthese years of studyingthousands of AIDS cases,no other methodsof transmission have been found. Education and Training 51 There is no evidence that AIPS is transmit-ted through:being closely associated with an infectedperson on a daily basis;shaking hands, touching, or other non-sexual physical contact with an infectedperson;using utensils, trays, sheets, towels, or foodthat has been touched or used by an in-fected person;coming into contact with toilet seats,showers, recreational equipment, or anyother facilities used by an infected person;being sneezed on, coughed on, or spit atby an infected person.This Georgia curriculum also places the casual con-tact issue in the context of prison life:There is no evidence that being in prison in-creases the risk of developing AIDS. Nearlyall of the inmates who have developed AIDShad a previous history of intravenous druguse, or shooting up, or homosexual activities.Inmate: who have not engaged in homosex-ual activity, intravenous drug use, tattooing,or sexual activity with someone infected withthe virus have no greater risk of developingAIDS than any other person.From \"Questions and Answers on AIDS\"in an Illinois inmate newspaper(answers prepared by the state's correctionalmedical direct or):12Question:Can AIDS be spread if someone were in thesame cell with a person with AIDS?Answer:Everything we know indicates that AIDScan only be spread through [sexual contactand needle-sharing]. No one who has livedin the same house as an individual withAIDS, including parents, brothers, sisters,friends, etc. has gotten AIDS from otherhousehold members. Even people who havekissed someone with AIDS and people whohave shared the same glasses, eating uten-sils, and bathrooms as someone with AIDShave not developed AIDS. This proves tous that it is very difficult to spread AIDS. 52 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESQuestion:Can AIDS be spread from a needle used bya nurse to draw blood or give a shot?Answer:Absolutely not. Only new, clean, sterileneedles are used for blood drawing and giv-ing shots.Question:What is being done within the prison systemto find out if anyone has AIDS?Answer:Every individual who enters ... [aninstitu-tion within] the Department of Correctionshas a complete history and physical as wellas other tests. Any inmate who appears tobe at greater risk of developing AIDS is puton a list and monitored very closely, in-cluding examination every 3 months. ...When we identify someone who may, infact, have AIDS we will enroll them in aspecial program so that they are followedup with other AIDS patients. . ..It is important that inmate educational programs avoidboth over-reaction to the AIDS problem and advocacyof unnecessary or inappropriate precautions. For ex-ample, some educaticnal materials urge inmates toavoid sharing cigarettes and drinking cups as ways toavoid transmission of HIV. By recommending suchmeasures, training programs are likely to perpetuatethe erroneous impression that the AIDS virus can betransmitted by casual contact. This is just the sort ofmisinformation that training programs are intendedto overcome. Rather, inmate training should em-phasize practical precautionary steps:From a Texas inmate training currkulum13Avoiding AIDSA. The only completely safe behavior is topractice abstinence from sex and IV drugs.This means not having sexual relationswith anyone, and not using any IV drugs.The next safest thing is to have sexual rela-tions with only one partnersomeone thatyou can be sure is faithful to you.B. Take precautions. Use a condom if youare not sure of your partner (who did theysleep with before you, and did they everuse IV drugs?). However, this will not 6 eliminate your risk completely. Condomsare not fail safe.1. Use rubber, not skin.2. Use spermicide (nonoxynol -9).3. Use condom during entire sex act; thevirus is also in pre-ejaculatory fluid.C. Do not share any kind of needle withanyone. That means IV needle or tattooneedle or any other kind. Any needle thathas been used by someone else may havethat person's blood on it and the bloodmay contain the AIDS virus. If you putthat needle into your arm, you will be in-jecting AIDS into yourself.D. Do not share anything that could havesomeone else's blood on it. Remember thatAIDS is passed through sextmt contact andblood-to-blood contact.Examples of Staff Education/TrainingGeneral training on the incidence and means oftransmission of AIDS and on specific preventionmeasures (especially emphasizing \"universal precau-tions\") should be provided to all correctional line staff.Education must emphasize that transmission can occuroutside, as well as inside, the correctional institution.It is important that staff training programs begin bysetting the proper tone and present a convincing ra-tionale for the material to follow. The following ex-ample is effective in this regard:From a Washington state correctional stafftraining curriculum:14RATIONALE FOR COURSEAs employees of the Department of Correc-tions,itis imperative that all of us beknowledgeable about \"Acquired ImmuneDeficiency Syndrome\"commonly referredto as \"AIDS\". The more we know about it,the better able we are to deal with the prob-lems associated with it and to allay the fearsand anxieties of those offenders for whom weare responsible.As professionals, you have demanding jobswhich involve a great deal of responsibility.At the institutional level, you are responsiblefor maintaining security and discipline, ensur-ing that a sanitary environment is maintained,keeping records, monitoring program activi-ties, and so on. But, above all, you are \"peopleworkers\" and, as such, you have a great dealof impact on the inmates for whom you areresponsible....In terms of AIDS and the impact it has on theway in which you deal with offenders, a pro-:essional attitude is critical. As correctionsemployees you must be concerned with thewelfare and well-being of inmates. If inmatessense that you are concerned about theirhealth problems and that you know what todo to help, they will be more inclined torespect you and to give you their cooperation.As a professional, your attitude should makeclear that you do care. If you do not conveythat attitude, regardless of your personal feel-ings, you do nothing other than inviteproblems.Staff training should present a straightforward assess-ment of the risk of HIV infection associated with thecorrectional officer's work.From a California AIDS information sheetfor correctional officers:15Information On Aids For CorrectionalOfficersSome Correctional Officers have expressedconcern about AIDS and other communicablediseases and how it affects the work place.THERE ARE NO REPORTED CASES OFPEACE OFFICERS CONTRACTING THEAIDS VIRUS DURING THE PERFOR-MANCE OF DUTIES.AIDS IS NOT TRANSMITTED BY:(1) Talking to an AIDS patient IN-TERVIEWS(2) Touching an AIDE patient HAND-CUFFING, BODY SEARCHES(3) Riding in a vehicle with an AIDS pa-tientTRANSPORT(4) Touching objects handled by an AIDSpatientCELL SEARCHES, EVI-DENCE GATHERING(5) Working with an AIDS patientThe following are further examples of accurate andreasonable presentations of risks:From a New York state brochure for cor-rectional staff:16 Education and Training 53 Question:I've been brown bagging it in case thecafeteria food or dishes are handled byAIDS patients. Am I being too cautious?Answer:Yes. Working in the same area, breathingthe same air, touching the same things (suchas dishes and eating utensils) will not giveyou AIDS.Question:I've been assigned to work in a unit whereAIDS patients are housed. Am I in dangerof getting AIDS?Answer:You would be at risk only if your job placedyou in situations in which body fluids froman AIDS patient could directly enter yourbody or bloodstream. There is no reason tobelieve, for example, that a person wouldget AIDS as a result of washing floors onan AIDS snit.Just as with inmate training, it is important to em-phasize that HIV is not transmitted by any form ofcasual contact and to advocate only measures designedto address known means of transmission or to preventactivities involving a significant risk of transmission.In general, this means applying universal infection con-trol procedures. Precautions designed to preventtransmission of Hepatitis-B are more than sufficientto prevent transmission of AIDS, since AIDS is moredifficult to transmit. Measures more restrictive thanthose applied to Hepatitis-B are unnecessary and in-appropriate for addressing the AIDS risk. (Specificprevention measures are discussed in detail in ChapterFive of this report.) The following excerpts effectivelycapture some of the key precautions for correctionalofficers:From a training curriculum for jail officersin Phoenix, Arizona:17There are several very simple tasks which youcan do that have been shown over and overagain to prevent the spread of infectiousdiseases, AIDS included.First:If you anticipate coming into contactwith blood such as during an assaultor an injury, put on disposable rub-ber gloves and avoid contact withyour skin, especially if you have anyopen cuts or wounds. 54 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESSecond: After contact with suspected con-taminatedmaterials, thoroughlywash your hands and all areas whichwere exposed to contamination. Asimple solution of household bleachdiluted 1:10 is sufficient to kill theAIDS virus. Containers of bleachare availableat severalstationsthroughout each jail. Contaminatedsurfaces should be thoroughly clean-ed with this dilute bleach solution.Third:Use extra care in handling objectswhich are contaminated with blood.Do not resheath needles but disposeof them in the proper imperviouscontainers. Make sure you do not in-jure yourself with sharp objects suchas razors or contraband weapons.When disposing of possibly con-taminated material, ensure that it isproperly wrapped and labeled sothat others are not inadvertentlyinjured.These steps are so obvious that theyare often neglected, yet they are yourbest defense against the spread ofblood-borne diseases. Should youever encounter a situation wherethere :,lay be contamination it paysto take your time and follow theabove advice.From a Texas staff training curriculum:18Following are guidelines and precautionarypractices security officers should observe dur-ing their tour of duty:A. Cell and Body Searches1. Make sure any open wounds and soresare covered with clean bandages to pre-vent possible exchange of blood.2. Wear protective gloves if there is achance of contact with blood or bodyfluids (urine, saliva, feces, vomit) on aninmate, clothing, or linen.3. Avoid needle sticks or punctures withany sharp objects (e.g., knives or razorsthat may be contaminated witil blood)on the inmate's body.4. Never blindly place hands in areaswhere there may be sharp objects thatcould cut or puncture the skin, and be 6S particularly alert for such objects dur-ing cell searches.5. Wash hands with soap and warm waterfollowing every search.From a Washington state correctional staffhandout on AIDS:19WHAT ARE THE PRECAUTIONS TO BETAKEN WHEN GIVING ... CPR?Cardiopulmonary resuscitation must be givento people in need of this life-saving procedure.While there is always some risk of being ex-posed to a communicable disease when giv-ing CPR, the risk is considered to be small.To minimize the risk of contamination, theDepartment will ensure that \"pocket masks\"are strategically located and readily availableto all staff when emergency resuscitation mustbe initiated. However, if a mask is not im-mediately available, mouth-to-mouth must beinitiated when necessary to save a life.Finally, staff training should emphasize the importanceof maintaining confidentiality regarding AIDS cases.The following excerpt effectively accomplishes this:From a Washington state correctional staffhandout on AIDS:20WHEN DEALING WITH AIDS, ARETHERE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONSRELATED TO CONFIDENTIALITY?The answer to this question is \"yes and no\".No, in the sense that DOC requires confiden-tiality in all medical matters except on a \"needto know\" basis. Yes, in the sense that violatingconfidentiality concerning AIDS can have fargreater consequences and cause a threat to thesecurity and the welfare of offenders andstaff. Violating an offender's right to con-fidentiality is in violation of law and makesthe person who violates that confidentialitypersonally liable for the consequences.Documenting Training Attendance andReceipt of Educational MaterialsWhere participation in inmate training programs isvoluntary, it is wise for administrators to maintain awritten record of those who did and did not chooseto attend and those who received educationalmaterials. In Maine, inmates may attend training orchoose not to attend, but in either case they mustacknowledge their choice in writing. Minnesota alsohas a sign-up system for AIDS training. New YorkCity placed copies of its AIDS policy in each staffmember's paycheck envelope and required each to signfor its receipt along with their check. The CaliforniaDepartment of Corrections also distributed AIDSinformation to staff with paychecks, and requires allinmates who are released to sign for AIDS informa-tion materials.Such records may be useful in the event of a lawsuit.They may help the correctional system to build an\"assumption of risk\" defense to a suit alleging that itsofficials were negligent in the infection of an inmateor staff member. In other words, the system shouldbe able to demonstrate that the individual was pro-vided education on the types of behaviors associatedwith transmission of the virus and the precautionarymeasures recommended to prevent acquisition of thevirus. If the individual chose not to receive (or choseto ignore) this training and education, he or she as-sumed the risk of engaging in those behaviors and the'stem should not be held responsible for the result.Jf course, this defense would only be applicable iftransmission of the infection occurred through aconsensual act or through personal carelessness ornegligence.Evaluating Education and TraininbCorrectional systems should periodically evaluate theirAIDS training so that it can be updated and improved.AIDS training and education programs can be evalu-ated in various ways. Some systems use pre- and post-tests of knowledge and find these a satisfactory methodof evaluation. To judge knowledge retention, institu-tions might consider administering follow-up post-testssome time after training is delivered. Inmates and staffshould also be asked to evaluate training sessions andmake suggestions for augmentation and improvement.The California Department of Corrections assesses thedistribution and impact of AIDS educational materialsin its institutions. In the assessment, staff and inmatesare asked whether they have seen particular brochuresand other materials and whether these materials havebeen helpful to them in understanding AIDS. Staff arealso asked to list typical inmate questions on AIDSand whether the materials provided by the departmentenable them to answer these questions. Inmates arealso asked to assess the answers they are receiving toAIDS-related questions. This assessment appears tobe a useful method of collecting feedback on AIDSinformational materials and improving the system'sAIDS information dissemination program. 63Education and Training 55 IIIIMINCAMIIIMMIIMIPIAW 11111=1W- ConclusionEducation and training keystone of thecorrectional response to AIDS.Virtually allresponding correctional systems are now providingsomeAIDSeducation to both inmates and staff. Livetraining has become much more prevalent in the twoyears since the first NIJ study. Education and train-ing are particularly necessary because of the persistenceof misinformation, as well as rational concerns, re-gardingAIDS.NIJ survey results show that staff andinmate concern aboutAIDShave not declined signifi-cantly in the last year.This chapter has discussed the following key elementsofAIDSeducation and training:AIDStraining should be timely that is,if possible, it should be presented beforewidespread concern takes hold.AIDStraining should be regularlypresented and regularly updated to respondto changing information and the oftenmisleading media coverage of AIDS.Misinformed fearwillreassertitselfwithout frequent doses of accurate infor-mation.AIDStraining should be mandatory forinmates and staff. This will be expensiveand logistically challenging, but the costand trouble are justified because the topicis of such great importance.Correctional systems should involve in-mates and staff in the development ofAIDSeducational programs. This can b.:done by soliciting particular questions andconcerns and using them as the basis of thetraining.AIDStraining should be live, so that in-mates have a chance to ask questions andreceive answers from knowledgeablespeakers. 56 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESLive training should be supplemented withvideotapes and/or written informationalmaterials.Alleducational programs and materialsshould use simple, non-technical languageunderstandable to the audience.Credibility is absolutely critical to the suc-cess ofAIDStraining. Systems can buildcredibility by using knowledgeable and ap-proachable trainers, ensuring that all train-ing is factual and consistent, and by usingpeer trainers or training teams.AIDSeducation should avoid extremes ofalarmism and complacency. It shouldneither advocate unnecessary and inap-propriate measures nor encourage a falsesense of security in any group. Rather,training should emphasize that everyonemust avoid certain well-defined behaviorsand exposures.AIDStraining should be keyed to thespecific concerns of a correctional au-dience. Strictly generic materials are insuf-ficient.AIDStraining content should focus onspecific risks and specific practical precau-tionary measures for inmates and staff. In-mate training should stress abstinence fromdrug use and sexual activity. However, asa realistic response, many correctionalsystems also include \"safer sex\" guidelinesand information on cleaning needles.All AIDStraining and materials distribu-tion should be documented in case of fu-ture lawsuits. This may enable systems tocounter claims that insufficient training onrisks and precautions was provided.AIDStraining and education should beperiodically evaluated so it can be updatedatid improved.

Thereappears to be significant confusion about the natureand meaning of HIV antibody testing. Although termssuch as \"Airs testing\" are often used, and individualsare commonly said to have \"tested positive for AIDS,\"the fact is that there is no blood test for AIDS. Asemphasized in Chapter One, the available tests do notdetermine whether or not an individual has AIDS;rather,AIDScan only be diagnosed through identifica-tion of \"indicator diseases.\" Indeed, the test does notdetect the presence of HIV itself only the presenceof antibodies to the virus.Aconfirmed positive result(using the double ELISA and Western Blot seeChapter One) only means that the individual wasinfected sometime in the past. Medical researchersgenerally agree that more than one-half of infectedindividuals (currently estimated to number 1-1.5million in the United Stat Nill go on to developARCor AIDS. However, becat e the incubation period ofAIDSis both proloived and uncertain, it ;s impossi-ble to predict eitherJw many or which particularseropositive persons will develop symptoms. Forcounseling and public health purposes, CDC recom-mends t' it all seropositive persons be considered in-fected and potential carriers of the virus.The major possible applications of HIV antibodytesting in correctional inmate populations are massscreening, risk-group screening, testing in response topotential transmission incidents, voluntary testing,voluntary testing on request, testing in support of blindepidemiological studies, and testing in the presence ofclinical indications or symptoms. Testing of staff mayalso be undertaken in limited instances. All of theseapplications are discussed below. Aparticular focusis the perceived advantages and disadvantages of massscreening programs. The chapter also summarizes thetesting procedures actually adopted by state and localcorrections authorities.Mass Screening for Antibodies to HIV:The DebateMass screening means mandatory testing of individualsfor antibodies to HIV, in the absence of any clinicalindications of disease, in order to identify specific in-dividuals who may be infectious. Mass screening usual-ly involves testing all inmates, all new inmates and/or r-74all inmates prior to release.Amore limited form ofscreening involves testing all inmates with discerniblehistoriesof high-risk behavior(e.g.,homosex-ual/bisexual males, intravenous drug abusers, pro-stitutes).There continues to be significant controversy about thewisdom and utility of mass screening in the correc-tional environment. This chapter will review the majorarguments in the debate. However, it is important toestablish at the outset the boundaries of that debate.The only legitimate purposes of which mass screeningin a correctional setting are:1) to reduce transmission of HIV in correc-tional institutions;2) to improve medical monitoring of andme-lical care for infected inmates; and/or3) (If screening is done pre-release) To informcounseling and supervision of releaseesregarding their behaviors in the outsideworld.Any decision to institute mass screening must be basedon a full and highly specific understanding of how theprogram will achieve these objectives, and on a deter-mination that its expected success in achieving themoutweighs the possible harmful effects of the programon the lives of inmates and the security of the institu-tion. Before mass screening is implemented, the cor-rectional authority should have decided exactly howit will use the test results to achieve these objectivesand satisfied itself that the funds to be ased for theprogram could not be better expended on AIDSeduca-tion or other preventive strategies.Unfortunately, intense political pressure now sur-rounds the issue of mass screening and this has toofrequently outweighed the need for a full and rationalassessment of the specific objectives and possiblydeleterious effects of testing programs. Indeed,responses to the NIJ survey indicate that many cor-rectional systems are under great pressure from gover-nors, legislatures, the media, and the public to beginmass screening. Based on NIJ survey responses, sixtypercent of all state systems and almost 60 percent ofstates that have adopted mass screening report receiv-ing such pressure.Twelve state systems and the Federal Bureau of Prisonshave mass screening programs, up from just three Mass Screminga Risk Group ScreeningbFigure 4.1CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS WITH MASS SCREENINGOR RISK GROUP SCREENING PROGRAMS, OCTOBER 1987State/FederalFederal Bureau of Prisons,Alabama, Colorado, Idaho,Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska,Nevada, mandatory testing of all new inmates, all releasees, and, or all current inmates regardless of the presence of clinkai indications.bDefined as testing of members of at least one AIDS \"risk group\" e.g., homosexual, bisexual males, intravenous drug users, prostitutes,pregnant females (because of the, possibility of perinatal transmission).cAnonymous testing only. states in 1986. The Federal system screened all new in-mates for several months, but recently decided ontesting only a 10 percent random sample of incominginmates and all inmates on release. In addition, six-teen state or federal systems and nine city and countysystems have instituted \"risk-group\" screening pro-grams, up from eleven and six last year (Figure 4.1).In Canada, n1 systems have instituted mass screeningbut three systems have undertaken risk-group screen-ing. Because of rapid population turnover in jails,screening to identify carriers of HIV is probably im-practical in these institutions. This is particularly trueof jails housing only (or primarily) pre-trial detainees.Indeed, no responding city or county correctionalsystems have instituted mass screening.To be sure, not all jurisdictions that have undertakenmass screening have done so in response to politicalpressure. Many of these decisions were based on a firmconviction that mass screening is the most effectiveway for correctional systems to discharge their respon-sibility to protect their inmates and staff from infec-tious diseases and to provide high-quality medicalmonitoring and medical care. Seven systems whichhave instituted mass screening cite identification of car-riers as a rationale for the decision, six cite targetingof education programs and seven cite improveddiagnosis. 60 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESNotably, the largest proportion (11, or 85 percent) ofmass screening jurisdictions listed a desire to estimatethe extent of the AIDS problem as a reason for theirpolicy. As will be discussed below, however, suchestimates can be developed through blindepidemiological studies which avoid many of the dif-ficulties associated with identity-linked mass screening.Some correctional systems have had a mass screeningpolicy imposed upon them by their executive orlegislature. These mandates have often reflected themistaken view that mandatory HIV antibody testingsomehow represents a \"magic bullet\" for the problemof AIDS or results from a political impulse tc showthe public that \"we're doing something about AIDS.\"1As reflected in responses to the third annual NUsurvey, however, more than 75 percent of state cor-rectional systems still believe that the disadvantagesof mass screening outweigh the potential benefits.Those who have decided against mass screening stressconcerns about the accuracy of the tests, inability tomaintain confidentiality of results and resultingostracism of and violence against inmates believed tobe infected, the costs and inherent logistical problems,the fact that feasible alternatives exist, and, mostimportantly, the belief that mass screening is not themost effective strategy for reducing transmission of7 3 HIV within correctional facilities and improving thequality of medical care for infected inmates. Screen-ing on discharge does not address these two objectivesbut has other benefits and poses fewer institutionalmanagement issues. Of course, screening on releasemay lead to discrimination if results are divulged. Thecentral issues in the complex debate over mass screen-ing in correctional facilities are reviewed below.Are HIV Antibody Tests Reliable andAccurate?If the benefits of a mass screening program are tooutweigh its disadvantages, then the program mustoffer highly accurate and reliable results. If, forexample, inmates are to be segregated or otherwisemanaged differently on the basis of test results, thenthe correctional system must be confident that it hasidentified, with a high degree of accuracy and com-pleteness, the group to receive such differentialmanagement. Indeed, there may be legal liabilityassociated with mislabeling an inmate as HIV-seropo sitive.Proponents of mass screening argue that the HIV an-tibody tests are highly reliable. Othe.s identify twoareas of serious concern about their reliability: 1) theproblem of lag-time between infection and 'ae ap-pearance of detectable antibodies, which me. thatcertain truly infected individuals will not be ideilfied;and 2) technical problems with the tests and testingprocedures which may produce incorrect resultsparticularly false positives.Lag-Time Between Infection and Appearanceof AntibodiesCDC estimates that, ,n average, six-twelve weekselapse between an individual's infection with HIV andthe appearance in the blood of detectable antibodiesto the virus.2 However, there have been isolatedreports of lag-times up to six .nonths, and recent datasuggest that even longer delays in antibody appearancemay not be unusual.3These facts are extremely important, because infectedindividuals are capable of transmitting the virus fromthe instant they are infected. Infectiousness, in otherwords, does not await the appearance of detectable an-tibodies. Negative antibody test results based on blooddrawn during this lag-time are, in effect, falsenegatives. Such instances have produced the very smallnumber of HIV infections associated with transfusionsadministered since universal screening of blood sup-plies began in 1985. The blood transfused in these caseswas donated by infected persons before the antibodieshad appeared.The lag-time problem should also be of concern to cor-rectional administrators contemplating any type ofmass screening program. It means that it is impossi-ble to guarantee detection of all infected members ofa population through one-time screening. Leavingaside the other reliability problems (discussed below),repeated followup testing of populations would benecessary to maximize the probability of detecting allinfected individuals. This may have serious cost andlogistical implications.Technical Problems with the TestsInterpretation of results is a key factor in the ultimatereliability of the ELISA test. The results of the testare measured on a continuous numerical scalerepresenting a color density reaction to the level of an-tibodies in the blood. Therefore, a decision must bemade astothe \"cutpoint\" on thisscale thatdistinguishes positive and negative results. Manufac-turers recommend setting a specific cutpoint for eachtest kit based on the degree of reaction to the knownpositive and negative control samples supplied.4Because the ELISA was initially developed to screenblood, the recommended cutpoints are deliberately setquite low to minimize false negative results. Whenscreening b:ood,itis better to discard possiblyuninfected -inits than to use possibly infected units.Of course, the low cutpoint designed for blood screen-ing produces a relatively large number of false positiveswhen the test is used to screen people.HIV ,ntibody tests are subject to error, even whenrecommended confirmatory procedures are used. Themajor problem appears to be with false positive results,although false negatives may also occur, particularlyin the high-risk populations of interest to correctionalagencies. False positives are of particular concern topersons being tested, who may suffer mental anguishand be subjected to severe discrimination. On the otherhand, false negatives are of particular concern to per-sons who may subsequently be infected by individualsthey believe to be free of HIV. Both problems shouldbe of serious concern to correctional agencies and mustbe carefully considered before any testing programand particularly, any mandatory testing programis instituted.The precision of a biomedical test is expressed in termsof the consistency of its results that is, it is highlyprecise if it always yields the same results whenrepeated under similar circumstances. However, HIV Screening and Testing 61 Figure 4.2HYPOTHETICAL HIV ANTIBODY SMEENING IN A POPULATION OF 500A 20% TRUE PREVALENCE OF INFECTION True Infection Category0.30/oc3.9d a This reflects the test sensitivity of 99%.bThis reflects thetest specificity of 99%.CThis is the percentage of all negative results which would be false.d This is thepercentage of all positive results which would be false. antibody test results have been shown to be affectedby relatively minor variations in tImperature, humidi-ty, and other factors.5Procedural variations and quality control deficienciescan also adversely affect the performance of HIVantibody tests. The Western Blot is particularly suscep-tible to human error and variability of results becausemost laboratories use unlicensed test kits.6 As a result,unlike the ELISA test, the Western Blot test is usual-ly not based on a standardized product. However, theELISA is also subject to variation because of thepossibility that different testing facilities will use dif-ferent criteria for setting the positive-negative cutpointwhich is critical to interpreting the test results.The accuracy of biomedical tests is generally measuredin terms of sensitivity and specificity. CDC estimatesthat the sensitivity and specificity of currently-licensedELISA tests are both 99 percent or higher (assumingthat a double ELISA test is performed), and theseestimates do not appear to be in question. Ninety-ninepercent sensitivity means that, on average, the test willcorrectly identify ninety-nine out of every hundred in-fected individuals. Ninety-nine percent specificitymeans that, on average, the test will correctly identifyninety-nine out of every hundred uninfected in-dividuals. 62 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESIn other words, 1 percent of actually infected personswill be false negative: on the test, and 1 percent ofactually uninfected persons will be false positives onthe test. This does not mean, however, that 1 percentof all positive or negative tests will be false. Thepercentage of positive (or negative) results which arefalse depends on the true prevalence of infection inthe tested population and on the sensitivity andspecificity of the test.Consider the two examples depicted in Figures 4.2 and4.3. In Figure 4.2, the true prevalence of infection ina population of 500 is 20 percent. The sensitivity andspecificity of the test are both assumed to be 99 per-cent. There are 400 uninfected persons of whom about1 percent, or four people, will have a false positive testresult. About 1 percent, or one, of the 100 infectedpersons will have a false negative test result. Thus, atotal of 103 people will test positive, of whom fourwill be false positives 3.9 percent of all positiveresults will be false.Figure 4.3 shows that when thc. true prevalence of in-fection is lower, the rate of false positives will increase,simply because there will be a larger number of trulyuninfected individuals, about 1 percent of whomwould test falsely positive. In Figure 4.3, the trueprevalence of infection is 1 percent in the hypothetical Figure 4.3HYPOTHETICAL HIV ANTIBODY SCREENING IN A POPULATION OF 500WITH A Pio TRUE PREVALENCE OF INFECTION True Infection Status a This reflects the test sensitivity of 9901o.b This reflects thetest specificity of 9901o.c This is the percentage of all negative results which would be false.d This is thepercentage of all positive results which would be false. population of 500, and the percentage of positiveresults which are false rises to almost 50 percent. Thenumber of false positives would continue to rise withincreases in the size of the tested population.Thus far, the discussion assumes that only a doubleELISA test has been performed. Reducing falsepositive rates depends heavily on the ability of theWestern Blot confirmatory test to eliminate falselypositive results from ELISA tests and thus increase thespecificity of the entire test sequence. Properly per-formed, the Western Blot is more highly specific thanthe ELISA. Assuming it improves specificity by aboutone-half of 1 percent, the percentage of positive resultswhich arfalse in the hypothetical high-prevalencepopulation (Figure 4.2) above would be cut in half (to2 percent), while in the lower-prevalence population(Figure 4.3), it would be reduced by about one-thirdto 34 percentstill a very significant proportion.Unfortunately, as noted, the Western Blot, as perform-ed in most laboratories, is not a standardized test likethe ELISA. Therefore, its application is more suscep-tible to variation and its overall performance is lessamenable to systematic evaluation.? Nevertheless,time hypothetical results underscore the importanceof the Western Blot test in reducing the number of falsepositives. In any testing program, great care shouldbe taken to maximize quality control in all phases, butparticularly in the Western Blot confirmatory phase.Because of the apparent susceptibility of these tests(particularly the Western Blot) to quality controlproblems, and because of the dramatic effect of los-ing even a fraction of 1-percent in specificity to suchproblems, several researchers contend that thenumbers of false positives will be unacceptably highin populations where the actual incidence of infectionis very low (such as persons applying for marriagelicenses or positions as police officers). These re-searchers have calculated that the percentage ofpositive results which will be false after the entire testsequence (including the Western Blot) in very low-riskpopulations could be in the range of 28 percent-90 per-cent.8 Indeed, Figure 4.3 has demonstrated that almost50 percent of positives would be false in a populationwith a one-percent true prevalence of infection.Figure 4.4 illustrates the problem in the correctionalsetting. Based on NIJ survey results presented inChapter Two, the prevalence of HIV infection in mostprison populations in the United States is probably be-tween 0.5 percent and 5 percent, with a few jurisdic-'tions sharply higher. Figures recently released by theFederal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) indicate that lessthan 3 percent of federal prisoners are infected with Screening and Testing63 Figure 4.4HYPOTHETICAL APPLICATION OF MASS SCREENING FORANTIBODIES Ti HIV IN A POPULATION OF 25,000 INMATES True Prevalenceof Infection 99.5%, 99.9%, and 99.99% specificity, .5%, .1% and .01%,respectively, of truly uninfected persons will be false positives.bFalse positive results as a percentage of all positive results.

The sensitivityof the test sequence is held constant at 99.5 percent.The percentage of positive results which would be falseunder this hypothetical application of mass screeningshows dramatic variations. At one extreme-99.5 per-cent specificity and 0.5 percent true irevalence- fullyone-half of confirmed positive results will be false.More than 120 uninfected inmates would be mislabeledas HIV-infected, with all of the potential problemsassociated with such a designation. Even at 99.9 per-cent specificity and 1 percent true prevalence, almost10 percent of positive results would be false- a notinsignificant proportion. At the other extreme, if weassume 99.99 percent test sequence specification, thepercentage of positive results which would be false isextremely low regardless of the true prevalence of in-fection. A hypothetical number and percentage ofpositive results which would be false may be easilycalculated fcr any scenario by substituting the popula-tion size, estimated trues prevalence of infection, andestimated test sequence sensitivity and specificity. 64 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESAgain, these results demonstrate the importance ofmaximizing the specificity of the test sequence. Thepotentially high percentages of false positive results inlow-prevalence populations also underscore the impor-tance of determining in advance how tests results areto be used. In any setting, the consequences of beingidentified as seropositive may be severe -but the ef-fects are probably more serious in a correctional en-vironment than elsewhere. Seropositive inmates maybe segregated, ostracized, and/or physically abused.Therefore, if a high percentage of positive results maybe false, the negative evitsequences of testing may faroutweigh the presumed benefits.Just as low-risk populations may present a seriousfalse-positive problem, in high-risk populations, theproblem of false negatives may reach fairly seriousproportions.19 For example, in the New York stateprison population of about 35,000 inmates where thetrue prevalence of infection is estimated by officialsto be about 30 percent, over fifty infected personswould not be identified through an HIV antibodyscreening program, assuming test sensitivity of 99.5percent. Although the percentage of negative resultswhich would be false is very low (less than one-halfof 1 percent), the absolute number of false negativeswould pose real problems if efforts to reduce transmis-sion were based on segregating seropositive inmates. This should be of real concern to any policy-makerconsidering HIV antibody screening as the basis ofcontrolling the spread of infection in a high-riskpopulation.Further complicating the picture is the possibilityraised by some researchers that intravenous drug usersand certain other groupsincluding women who haveborne more than one child, persons who have receivedblood transfusions, persons with alcoholic hepatitis,and homosexual men who have participated in recep-tive anal intercourse may be prone to false positiveresults. This is because, for various reasons, they allmay have antibodies in their systems mistakenlyrecognized by the ELISA test as antibodies to HIV.11In general, the diverse potential problems suggest theneed for real caution in decisions io institute any large-scale testing program.Can Mass Screening Prevent Transmissionof HIV?As emphasized above. correctional systems should beconvinced that mass screening will actually reducetransmission of HIV and should have determined howthe test results will be used to achieve this objective,before they decide to institute such a program.Proponents of mass scra.iiing argue that HIV antibodyscreening facilitates policies that will reduce transmis-sion. They argue that seropositive individuals shouldbe identified so they may receive special housing,supervision, counseling, education and other program-ming. Such steps, proponents believe, will most effec-tively prevent transmission of the virus to otherinmates and to staff. They feel this will be valuablefor staff to know which inmates are infected so theycan take special precautions when dealing with them.It will also be valuable to use HIV antibody statusin combination with other information regarding theinmate's potential for assaultive, sexually predatory,or promiscuous behavior to make key classificationdecisions. Limited space for segregation and otherspecial housing, proponents contend, require narrow-ing the focus to inmates who are both HIV seropositiveandpose serious potential behavior problems.Critics, on the other hand, respond that sophisticatedclassification procedures possibly using resourcesdiverted from mass screening can effectively identifypredators, victims, and others likely to be involved inhig%-risk behaviors, and effectively minimize oppor-tunities for such activities to occur. In particular, criticssuggest that funds which might be required for massscreening could better be used to prevent rapes andother victimization that may lead to transmission ofHIV in correctional facilities.12 They believe it moreappropriate, in short, to focus on identifying predatorsand preventing victimization than on trying to iden-tify all seropositives, many of whom may pose nobehavioral problems.Critics also suggest that mass screening may not be aneffective way to promote behavior change and reducetransmission of HIV. Serious questions have beenraised as to whether knowledge of antibody status willlead ti., salutary behavior change. Indeed, some haveargued that persons with sociopathic (psychopathic)personalities, which are common among correctionalinmates, may instead tend to exhibit increasinglyreckless and irresponsible behavior if informed thatthey are infected with HIV. In other words, they mayset out deliberately to infect others. As a result, it maybe very difficult for correctional systems to deal withHIV seropositives once they have been identified.Issues arise concerning special housing and program-ming that may not be medically necessary but may beconsidered appropriate to maintain institutional securi-ty and order. This is a particularly serious concern forsystems that are likely to have large numbers ofseropositive inmates and may be ; nable to meetdemands for segregated housing.From the standpoint of staff safety, the questions maybe asked: What specific special precautions could stafftake to protect themselves from infected inmates ifthey knew these inmates' i-'1. ';s? In other words,what could they do in .% .....fic situations, such asassaults or fights. if they knew the inmates' antibodystatus that they would not or could not do in theabsence of such information? On the contrary, health-care workers, correctional workers, and others shouldbe urged to avoid unprotected contact with the bloodor body fluids ofeveryone. Itis not necessary to knowindividuals' antibody status in order to implement suchprecautions. Indeed, such knowledge undermines theimplementation of universal precautions by inevitablycreating a double standard. As the discussion of testreliability indicates, mass screening wi:1 not be able toidentify all infected individuals, so a far preferablepolicy may be to apply the same standard precautionsto all inmates.Specific policy options for managing HIV seropositives(such as administrative segregation, single-celling, andmaintaining them in the general population) will bediscussed in Chapter Five. However, the critical pointhere is that decisions about the programmatic implica-tions of testing must be reached before any such pro-gram is initiated. In some systems, for instance, theexpected cost of separate housing and programmingfor large numbers of seropositives seems to have heavi-ly influenced decisions against mass screening. In other Screening and Testing65 systems, however, particularly those where rates ofseropositivity are expected to be low, correctionalauthorities may believe that the benefits of identify-ing seropositives v:11! outweigh the negative conse-quences of a bcreening program.Not surprisingly, therefore, survey results show thatHIV antibody screening has been most often adoptedin states with very few inmates AIDS cases: 92 per-cent of states doing mass screening, and 64 percent ofstates doing risk group screening, have had fewer thanfour AIDS cases among inmates.Will Mass Screening Improve MedicalMonitoring and Care?Proponents of mass screening argue that identifyingseropositives will facilitate timely medical monitoringdiagnosis and intervention. They suggest that staff andresource limitations preclude intensive medicalmonitoring of all inmates. particularly those who aredisplaying no overt symptoms of illness. Screeningallows medical staff to focus their monitoring on thoseinmates most likel,,, to need attention so that diagnosisand treatment can be carried out on a more timelybasis.Critics argue that it is unfair to subject inmates to theinevitable stigma associated with a label of HIV-infected if no effective cure or therapy can be givento them in return. Moreover, they contend, there arereasonable alternatives to mass screening for the pro-active identification of inmates most at risk for HIVinfection.In general, physicians who oppose mass screeningargue that medical surveillance and diagnosis must beseen as a process that involves asking the right ques-tions in history-taking, performing the correct physicalexaminations, and being carefully attuned to the signsand symptoms of ARC and AIDS. HIV antibodytesting cannot substitute for this total and ongoingprocess. If properly done, history-taking and physicalexaminations may be viable alternatives to HIV screen-ing and may avoid the potential negative effects ofscreening. History-taking and physical examinationsmay help to identify those inmates at highest risk forbeing infected or developing ARC or AIDS, and mayalso yield opportunities to provide important educa-tional information regarding the transmission of HIVinfection.Careful and complete history-taking includes stand-ardized questions on ARC symptoms and on lifestyleand health habits. It should be recognized, of course,that information provided by inmates regarding theirlifestylesparticularly intravenous drug use and sex-66 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIrSual activitymay not be fully reliable. Therefore, par-ticular attention must be paid to physical indicatorsand other clues to the presence of risk factors. An ex-panded physical examination for HIV-related factorsincludes more careful oral/pharyngeal examination,lymph node search, and anal examination. (Examplesof screening and history-taking protocols fromMaryland and several other states are included inAppendix F.)Follow-up on the history-taking and physical examina-tion includes careful medical surveillance of signs andsymptoms and tracking of individuals at risk for HIVinfection. Several jurisdictions have instituted com-prehensive programs for identifying and tracking in-mates with histories of high-risk behavior, in clearpreference to large-scale antibody testing. For exam-ple,Illinois medically monitors all inmates withhistories of intravenous drug abuse and current lym-phadenopathy, as well as all homosexual and bisexualinmates. These inmates all receive a physical examina-tion (including white blood count) every three months.Illinois has a \"tickler file\" system to ensure that theseexaminations are carried out as scheduled. Texas,Indiana, and San Francisco also identify and monitorinmates at apparent high risk for HIV infection.Is It Possible to Maintain the Confidentialityof Antibody Test Results in CorrectionalFacilities and How Does Disclosure AffectSeropositive Inmates?Proponents of mass screening argue that confidentiali-ty of test results can be effectively maintained in a cor-rectional institution. Care can be taken to ensure thatresults are not entered in inmates' medical records andthat any lists of seropositive inmates are always keptlocked and secured from unauthorized access. (Thecomplex and controversial question of who should beauthorized access to results of any HIV antibodytestingmass screening or selective testingis discuss-ed in Chapter Six.)Critics suggest that confidentiality of such sensitiveinformation is impossible to maintain in a prison orjail ar, d that, when results or rumored results inevitablybecome known, serious difficulties are almost sure tobefall seropositive inmates. One prison physician notedthat the \"inmates' communication system is better thanthe staffs.\" Of course, confidentiality is less likely tobe maintainedand pel:,aps less important, at leastinsofar as inmate saftey is concerned if seropositivesare segregated or otherwise housed separately.Moreover, many correctional administrators maintainthat if mass screening was being undertaken, even ifconfidentiality could be assured, any individual might761 be rumored to be seropositive regardless of actual testresults. The potential problem of false positives, asdiscussed earlier, wouid only add to the difficulty.If actual or rumored test results become known to thelarger correctional population, inmates may face in-timidation, threats, or actual violence. If seropositivesare segregated, they might be better protected than ifthey were maintained in the general population. Itseems clear that if mass screening is to be undertakenand if seropositives are to remain a the generalpopulation, it is absolutely critical that confidentiali-ty be preserved. Seropositive inmates housed in thegeneral population reported in interviews that they andothers had ben verbally and physically abused byother inmates. (Of course, similar problems may oc-cur in any testing program in which seropositives re-main in the general population.) Moreover, disclosureof positive test resultsregardless of its effects in thecorrectional settingcould subject inmates to seriousdiscrimination in employment, housing, and insurabili-ty after they are released.What Are the Legal Implications of MassScreening?Mandatory mass screening programs may be impossi-ble to implement under existing laws or policies insome jurisdictions. For example, laws in California,Wisconsin, Massachusetts, New York, the District ofColumbia and several other jurisdictions prohibit HIVantibody testing without the informed consent of thesubject. Lawsuits may also affect policies on man-datory testing. For example, suits have been filed byinmates in a number of states demanding mandatorytesting of all inmates. (See Chapter Six for a summaryof this and other caselaw.) Decisions favoring theplaintiffs in such cases may create conflicts withexisting state laws requiring informed consent.There may also be a right of refusal based on ethicalconsiderations. Those who oppose mandatory massscreening argue that because disclosure of test resultscan have very serious negative consequences, medicalethics require that there be a right of refusal. Theyliken this right to a patient's right to refuse a poten-tially risky surgical procedure, such as open-heartsurgery. On the other hand, some correctional ad-ministrators and their legal counsel are concerned thatif they fail to identify seropositive inmates through masscreening and to take strong action to prevent theirtransmitting the virus to others, the jurisdiction andits officials may be subject to lawsuits. Such suits mightbe filed by inmates or staff who may become infectedwith HIV and allege that the correctional system wasnegligentit,not identifying and segregatingseropositive inmates or taking other measures to pre-vent transmission of the virus.Many correctional lawyers, however, point out thatthe two primary methods of HIV transmissionsexualcontact and intravenous drug use are already pro-hibited in correctional institutions, and thus it is onlythe victim of forced sexual activity who could bringsuch a claim. These lawyers believe that improvedpoliciesand procedurestopreventsexualvictimization if appropriately developed andenforced would be sufficient to defend against acharge of negligence.Lawyers also respond to the concern about lawsuitsby noting that it is extremely difficult to establish ex-act causation in the development of AIDS, ARC, orHIV infection. If it is difficult to identify the specificincident responsible for transmission of the virus, itis even more difficult to prove that the system wasnegligent in failing to prevent that incident. (ChapteiSix discusses these legal implications in greater detail.)Correctional systems should also consider their possi-ble liability in falsely labeling an inmate infected. Ifan inmate tested positive and was subjected to segrega-tion, discrimination, or abuse as a result, but wasretested after release and found to be negative, he orshe could sue the correctional system.A final question illustrates the legal complexities ofmass screening in a correctional setting: If a correc-tional system institutes mass screening, citing the rightof correctional officers to know the antibody statusof all person, with whom they could become involvedin potential transmission incident, then can inmatesjustifiably argue for the converse: that is, that theyknow the antibody status of all staff?How Costly Are Mass Screening Programs?While proponents argue that screening could be ac-complished economically, some correctional ad-ministrators argue that such programs would beprohibitively expensive. There are really two majorcost components that must be considered: the actualcosts of testing, and the costs of implementing anypolicy decisions regarding HIV seropositive in-dividuals. In addition, the opportunity costs that is,the programs or functions which those funds other-wise would have supported should be considered.Survey results show that the ELISA test can be pur-chased relatively cheaply in large volume (average pertest, $13, with a range of $2 to $38). The cost of theconfirmatory Western Blot averages about $41 per test,with a range of $2 to $99. This adds significantly tothe total cost, particularly if a large number of inmatesScreening and Testing6730 tested positively on the ELISA. However, the maybe ways to reduce the cost per test sequence. Amanufacturer may offer a flat rate as low as $3 pertest sequence (to include the double ELISA andWestern Blot),particularly where the ELISAseropositive rate is expected to be quite low.While the cost per test sequence may not be particular-ly high, critics argue that the total cost of administer-ing tests to a large inmate population may besignificant. Moreover, follow-up testing of initialnegatives poses difficult problems: should the systemretest to determine if seroconversion has occurred and,if so, at what intervals? Critics of mass screening arguethat the need for repeat testing creates almost insur-mountable logistical and cost problems, particularlyfor large systems.Added to the costs of testing must be the costs of im-plementing any policy decision regarding seropositives.These might include construction or renovations re-quired for separate housing units, as well as the costsof counseling, special programming, additional super-vision,or other precautionary and preventivemeasures.Will Mass Screening Support or Underminethe Effects of Education and PreventionPrograms?Proponents of mass screening argue that correctionalsystems must identify potentially infectious inmates,in order to target to maximum effect their educationaland counseling programs and other preventivemeasures. In this view, the information is also essen-tial to target measures for preventing the transmissionof the virus after an inmate is released.Opponents of mass screening argue that it is un-necessary and possibly counterproductive to targetspecial educational programs and preventive measuresto seropositive individuals. They believe that suchtargeted.programs may stigmatize one class of inmates,subjecting them to potential intimidation and violence.One state prison, suffering from serious budget limita-tions, planned to distribute a booklet titled \"What Gayand Bisexual Men Should Know About AIDS\" onlyto those inmates who had been treated for a venerealdisease whiles incarcerated or who had been otherwiseidentified as engaging in homosexual ,s:tivity. Thisplan would have clearly marked a gro d of inmatesas gay, possibly subjecting them to victimization.Luckily, officials decided at the last minute todistribute the booklet toallinmates.I3 68 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESThe point is that targeted education and i ,ntionprograms might give insufficient attention tu.he realrisks, and associated precautions, applicable to all in-mates. Seronegative inmates might be considered\"safe\" for sexual victimization by others or they mightunjustifiably consider themselves \"safe\" from infec-tion and thus pay little or no attention to the recom-mendations of educational programs on AIDS. Asalready noted, a negative test says nothing of thelikelihood of future infection, particularly if high-riskbehaviors are continued. Thus, screening might lullseronegatives into a false sense of security and under-mine the important educational message that everyoneneeds to be very careful about behaviors known to beassociated with HIV transmission.Will Mass Screening Allay or Inflame theFears of Inmates, Staff, and the Public?Some of those who favor mass screening suggest thatthe results of such programs may allay the fears ofAIDS within correctional institutions more effective-ly than any education program. They advocate massscreening as a means of demonstrating to the generalpublic, inmates, and correctional staff that prisons andjails are not \"breeding grounds\" of HIV infection andAIDS. Again, however, mass screening is not necessaryto demonstate this point. The Oregon correctionalsystem,forinstance,isundertaking ablindepidemiological study of HIV infection in its institu-tions, in the hope that low seroprevalance rates willcalm public concern and defuse demands for man-datory mass screening.Of course, mass screening for public relations purposesdepends on discovering low rates of HIV seropositivi-ty. Publicizing high rates may greatly increase fearamong inmates and staff. The New York City Depart-ment of Corrections has a very strong policy againstmandatory mass screening. City correctional officialsestimate that there are large numbers of seropositiveinmates in the system. However, they note that withouta mass screening program to call attention to this factand to identify and stigmatize seropositive inmates, butwith a strong educational program for all inmates andstaff,there has been a minimum of fear anddisruption.In considering the public's reaction to the problem ofAIDS in prisons and jails, proponents of mass screen-ing suggest that it is the iesponsibility of correctionalsystems to know the prewilence of HIV infection intheir institutions and to determine the degree to whichit is being transmitted. They suggest that failure toinstitute mass screening may undermine the system's 1 credibility and create a serious public relations prob-lem. Proponents of screening are concerned that thepublic might criticize the correctional system for \"notinstituting policies that address the problem head-on\"and conclude that \"if they aren't testing, they musthave something to hide.\" These views, in turn, mayfeed a general public perception that prisons and jailsare \"breeding grounds\" for evils such as AIDS aperception that correctional administrators are noteager to encourage.Critics respond that there are better policies than massscreening for addressing the problem of AIDS inprisons and jails. They argue that the public can beconvinced of this fact by judicious presentations of therisks and benefits of mass screening programs and thealternatives available to address the problem such asblind epidemiological studies.Is Mass Screening the Best Way to Lssess theExtent of the AIDS Problem in an InmatePopulation?Proponents argue that mass screening is the best wayto determine the prevalence of HIV infection and thetransmission of the virus in correctional institutions.However, carefully designed epidemiological studiescan provide accurate data on prevalence and transmis-sion of HIV while avoiding some of the potentialproblems of mass screening. Such studies can also helpto identify the epidemiological correlates of infectionin the correctional setting. Finally, they can be usedto project future numbers of AIDS awl ARC cases andthus inform budgeting for treatment and possiblefacility expansion.Epidemiological studies can be done anonymously sothat no one knows who was tested, or with whatresults. A number of correctional systems have alreadyundertaken or plan to undertake blind HIV prevalencestudies. The results of some of these were presentedin Chapter Two. In addition, the Centers for DiseaseControl and the National Institute of Justice are plan-ning to sponsor a \"sentinel\" seroprevalence study inten3rrectional systems nationwide representing av'zty of inmate populations and presumed infection1..tes.The most commonly recommended model for HIVtransmission studies is to test an incoming cohort ofinmates and to retest the same cohort at regular inter-vals thereafter. Anonymity can be maintained by col-lecting and freezing intake and followup blood sampleslabeled with a common study number and destroyingthe linkage between inmate name and study numberbefore any testing is done. This is the approach usedin a study being undertaken in the Illinois Departmentof Corrections under the sponsorship of CDC.Another approach is to test inmates continuously in-carcerated since before the AIDS virus first appearedin the United States. This was the method used in thefirst Maryland study discussed in Chapter Two.Should Correctional Systems Be Taking StepsNot Taken in Society at Large?Mass screening clearly raises the issue of whether cor-rectional systems should be .aking steps not generallybeing taken in the community at large, or even in otherlong-tern., care facilities such as hospitals and mentaiinstitutions. Apart from screening donated blood andblood products, the only mass screening programs cur-rently m progress outside corrections are the routinetesting of all prospective armed forces recruits and cur-rent military personnel, and the screening of all ap-plicants for the foreign service, all applicants forimmigration to the United States and, in two states(Illinois and Louisiana), all applicants for marriagelicenses.Two arguments have been used to support screeningof military personnel. First, the armed services needa \"walking blood bank\" that is absolutely safe in caseof a combat deployment. In other words, it must beperfectly safe to obtain donated blood from any in-dividual in order to tranfuse another. The second argu-ment is that all military personnel must receive livevaccines against various diseases, but that immuno-suppressed individuals might develop these diseasesfrom the vaccine itself. (This argument also supportsscreening of foreign service applicants.) Neither of themilitary rationales is relevant to corrections popula-tions.Screening of potential immigrants, whilesomewhat controversial, does not involve U.S. citizensor persons currently residing inthiscountry.Premarital screening has been harshly criticized on thegrounds that it will be extremely ext ensive, yet iden-tify far more false positives than truly infectedpersons.14The primary argument for mass screening in the cor-rectional setting rests on the assumption that rates ofseropositivity and of HIV transmission are likely tobe higher among prison inmates than in the popula-tion at large. In this view, since rates of int-ray:mousdrug abuse among criminal of fendm.:7 higher thanthose of the general population, .1.4rA. Josi:ivity ratesamong incoming inmates may be ,,,gnificant. Theremay also be opportunities for inmates to transmit theinfection through sexual activity and needle-sharing R2Screening and Testing69 while incarcerated. This, proponents suggest, justifiestaking unusual steps to reduce transmission. Surveyresponses show that ten of thirteen systems (77 per-cent) which have instituted mass screening consider theinformation \"very\" rr \"somewhat\" useful in achiev-ing their correctio,. managementobjectives.Critics of mass screening point out that there is noevidence of higher rates of HIV transmission in cor-rectional institutions than in the general population,and that, absent such evidence, it is dangerous and un-justifiable to apply measures to prisoners which arenot applied to others. Even if mass screening, segrega-tion and other prevention measures based on iden-tification of seropositives could reduce transmissionof HIV and facilitate medical monitoring, opponentsargue, these goals can be as well achieved by educa-tion, prevention of victimization, and other lessintrusive measures.15 The decision to adopt or rejectmass screening, therefore, may not really constitutea choice between ?ursuing legitimate public healthint,!rests and supporting the individual rights of in-mates. Rather, the alternatives to mass screening mayenable systems to better serve both of these vitalinterests simultaneously.If and when therapeutic drugs such as AZT prove ef-fective in inhitIting the development of illness inasymptomatic seropositive individuals, there may bebetter reason to screen inmates. However, it is unlikelythat mandatory screening would be required in suchcircumstances, as persons who believed they might beinfected would presumably flock to be tested.Summary of NIJ Survey ResultsTwelve states am.. the Federal Bureau of Prisons haveinstituted or planned mass screcning of PH inmates orall new inmates for antibodies to HIV. No city orcounty correctional systems have adopted this policy.Ten of the systems-(nine states-and-the-Federal-Bureauof Prisons) now doing mass screening (77 percent) in-stituted the policy since the 1986 NIJ survey. Asalready noted, almost all of the mass screeningjurisdictions are small states with few or no AIDS casesin their correctional systems. The ten jurisdictionswhich have adopted mass screening since 1986 citeda variety of rationales for their polices. About halfcited the desire to identify HIV carriers, to targeteducational programs, to make better budget projec-tions, and to respond to potential transmission in-cidents. AN it two-thirds cited improved diagnosticprocedures. 1-:owever, the largest number (eight of ten)cited the need to estimate the extent of the problem.(As has been discussed previously, such estimates maybe more easily and economically obtained from blind 70 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESepidemiological studies.) Finally, as has also beennoted, almost 60 percent of these jurisdictions reportedthat they had been under political pressure to institutemass screening. Two systems replied that state law re-quired mass screening of prisoners, and anotherreported that its mass screening policy resulted entirelyfrom \"political pressures by individuals who knownothing of the disease and are panic-stricken.\"None of the five jurisdictions that collectively accountfor almost two-thirds of all inmate AIDS cases NewYork State, New Yczk City, New Jersey, Florida, andTexas have implemented mass screening of inmates.Most jurisdictions, including New York State, NewYork City, and Florida conduct testing only whenclinically indicated. New Jersey tests all pregnantfemales believed to be at risk (e.g., intravenous drugabusers) and inmates with clinical indications of HIVinfection. No -anadian correctional systems are con-ducting massHIV antibody testi:.._ occurs on a more limited basisin almost all of the jurisdictions responding to the NIJsurvey. Figure 4.5 summarizes the questionnaireresponses on the types of screening/testing programscurrently in place or planned for the near future. Thefigure shows that 31 percent of state/federal systemsand 27 percent of responding city/county systemsscreen members of at least one \"risk group\" regardlessof whether these individuals display clinical indica-tions. On the other hand, more systems (73 percentof state/federal systems and 45 percent of respondingcity/county systems in the United States) use the HIVantibody test in the presence of clinical indications.Forty percent of Canadian systems test when clinicallyindicated and another 40 percent do no testing at di.We believe that survey respondents may have under-reported testing when clinically indicated.Some correctional systems provide testing to any in-mate on-request (49-percent of state/federal systemsand 55 percent of responding city/county systems inthe United States). Some systems also test inmatcs onrequest if they have a history of high-risk behavior.Twenty-five percent of state/federal systems use (orplan to use) HIV antibody testing for anonymousepidemiological studies while only 9 percent of theresponding city/county systems in the United Statesreport testing for epidemiological studies. The numbersin Figure 4.5 add to more than the total number ofjurisdictions responding because the policy categoriesshown are not mutually exclusive.Figure 4.6 places the screening/testing policies of theresponding jurisdictionsintomutually exclusivecategories and compares them to the 1986 results.

Smaller percentages of correctional systemsthan before are limiting their testing to the presenceof clinical indications. This shows that about one-halfof American jurisdictions (47 percent of state/federalsystems and 42 percent of responding city/countyjurisdictions) in the United States and one-fourth ofCanadian systems test inmates only when clinicallyindicated, in response to incidents, or in support ofblindepidemiological studies.In 4 percent ofstate/federal systems, 24 percent of respondingcity/county jurisdictions and 8 percent of Canadiansystems, testing is conducted only on a voluntary basisor on request. One-fourth of the state/federal systems,but no city/county systems and no Canadian systems,make HIV antibody testing of inmates mandatory. Asdiscussed above, these decisions may be guided in largemeasure by law, policy, and ethical considerations. Inseveral jurisdictions, including Iowa, inmates mayrefuse to be tested, but if they do so, they are placedinsegregationuntiltheywillsubmittothe test.Virtually all (88 percent) of the state /federal correc-tional systems employ the double ELISA test with con-firmation by Western Blot. However, only about halfof city/county and Canadian systems that do HIVtesting reported using this standard test sequencerecommended by CDC. Many jurisdictions reporteduncertainty as to the exact testing protocol used.Several others indicated that the protocol varied acrossthe system. This variability could mean potentialproblems with testing quality control and accuracy.The following sections describe some of the other ap-plications of HIV antibody testing being used in theresponding jurisdictions.Other Applications of HIV AntibodyTestsThis sec.ion discusses other correctional applicationsof the }(IV antibody test besides mass screening.

This is a hierarchical categorization.

However, it may be very difficult to definethe groups to be tested and to identify all theirmembers with certainty. siorcover, since AIDS is adisease of high-risk behaviors rather than hig%-riskgroups, \"risk-group\" screening may not succeed in 72 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESidentifying all ore yen most of the infected individuals.The most commonly defined \"risk groups\" for AIDSor ARC are intravenous drug abusers, homosexual andbisexual men, and certain pregnant women. In somejurisdictions it would be difficult to define a set of \"riskgroups\" that did not collectively cover virtually allinmates in the system. If this is the case, \"risk group\"screening in effect becomes screening of all inmates,with the concomitant stigmatization and other illeffects for large segments of the inmate populationInduct, any screening of groups, however designed,may have negative effects for all members of suchgroups.The question of whether to test pregnant women, oreven all women of childbearing age, has avisen because8:j of the possibility of perinatal transmission of the AIDSvirus. CDC has recently recommended that all preg-nant women and all women of childbearing age withidentifiable risks for HIV infection be counseled androutinely tested for antibodies to HIV (\"routine\"testing means testing unless the subject declines).16Several systems now test all pregnant women inmates.Finally, in response to concerns about AIDS, manyjurisdictions have eliminated plasmaphoresis programsor prohibited inmates from donating blood. In statesthat have maintained their plasmaphoresis programs,all inmate participants must be tested. This is clearlyan absolute requirement rather than an option, becauseof the very real public health and legal liability con-cerns regarding the blood supply.Testing in Response to PotentialTransmission IncidentsIndividuals may be .ested if they are involved in aparticular incident in which exposure may have oc-curred. In correctional institutions, such incidents in-clude needlesticks or other sharp instrument injuries,forcible rapes, biting incidents, and other situationsin which there may have been blood-to-blood contactor exposure to other bodily fluids of individuals knownA suspected to be infected with HIV.Correctional systems' policies in these instances varyconsiderably. The major issue seems to be whether in-mates can be required to undergo testing if they havebeen involved in an incident. Forty-three percent ofstate/federal correctional systems, 24 percent ofcity/county systems, and only 8 percent of Canadiansystems believe that they can require testing of in-dividuals involved in incidents. Texas requires testingof inmates who commit sexual assault, throw bloodor body fluids at staff or otherwise intentionally oraccidentally expose staff to blood or body fluids.Inmates who refuse to be tested are treated as if theywere HIV seropositive.17 Georgia has adopted a com-prehensive policy recommending (but not mandating)testing in certain situations. (This policy is includedin Appendix G.) Some correctional systems, includingNew Mexico's, believe that they will be able to obtaina court order requiring an inmate to undergo testingfollowing a potential transmission incident. However,laws in a number of states currently prohibit HIV an-tibody testing and/or prohibit disclosure of test resultswithout informed consent. Cases have already beendecided with reference to these laws, as well as to theprobability of transmission in particular incidents. Itis possible that at least some of these laws will soonbe modifiedto permit involuntarytesting anddisclosure of test results of persons who commit ag-gressive acts which might transmit HIV. A law requir-ing esting of inmates who bite, cause exchange ofbodily fluids, or throw any bodily secretion on anotherperson has recently been passed in Iowa.18 (SeeChapter Six for further discussion of these legal issues.)If testing is to be done at all, it is generally agreed thatindividuals involved in incidents should be tested im-mediately to determine whether or not they wereseropositive at the time of the incident. If so, theyobviously could not seroconvert as a result of theincident. Follow-up testing on initial negatives may beperformed at three-month intervals after the incident,as it generally takes three-twelve weeks following in-fection for the antibodies to appear.Voluntary TestingIn voluntary testing programs, the correctional systemmay request or recommend that all or certain inmatesbe tested, but the system cannot or will not attemptto compel cooperation. In Montgomery County,Maryland, for example, all inmates with histories ofhigh-risk behavior are requested to submit to the anti-body test but no testing is performed without inform-ed conser... Texas also offers testing to such inmateson a voluntary basis. The Massachusetts Sheriffs'Association recently recommended that all the state'scounty houses of correction offer all inmates testingon a voluntary basis with strict assurance of confiden-tiality.19 Wyoming and San Bernardino County(California) conduct testing only on a voluntary basis.There can be forms of coercion, such as threats ofsegregation, applied even in ostensibly voluntarytesting programs. The former director of New YorkCity's Montefiore Medical Center/Rikers IslandHealth Services emphasizes that no one should becoerced or pressured into being tested and urges thatthe anonymity of anyone who is tested should beassured by using alternative test sites.Informed consent should be obtained using a form thatclearly lays out all the implications of being tested, in-cluding an enumeration of those entitled to receive theresults, a realistic assessment of the possibility thatconfidentiality may be breached, and a statement ofthe likelihood that special housing or programmingwill be necessary for seropositive individuals. A con-sent form used in Wisconsin is included in AppendixH. The Wisconsin form is quite good, although it maybe somewhat too optimistic regarding the likelihoodthat the results will remain confidential.In addition, inmates should be clearly advised of thepossible negative effects of test results on their abilityto obtain housing, employment, and insurance after 8uScreening and Testing73 they are discharged. This should constitute a part ofstandard pre-test counseling.Testing on RequestAbout one-half of responding American correctionalsystems provide testing to inmates on request. Two im-tortant questions arise here. First, do correctionalsystems have a legal obligation to provide testing onrequest? And, second, is anyone entitled to testing onrequest, or only those with a supportable reason fordesiring the test (e.g., involvement in an incident,history of high -risk behavior, or presence of symp-toms)': There are no :.onclusive answers to these ques-tions, although pending lawsuits in several states willundoubtedly clarify the issues. In the meantime,policies differ. Maine, for instance, will provide up totwo requested, but \"not medically indicated,\" tests peryear. Texas will provide only one such test per year.20Notably, there may already be an important precedentin Estelle v. Gamble,21 one of the leading cases oncorrectional health care standards. While this decisionestablishes that correctional systems have an obliga-tion to respond to the medical needs of inmates, it doesnot give inmates the right to dictate the quantity orquality of the medical care provided. According toEstelle, this must remain a medical decision. Thisseems to support the position that correctional systemscould deny HIV antibody tests to inmates, at leastwhere there were no apparent clinical indications orother legitimate reasons for testing.Another issue affecting testing on request is the typeof counseling that is provided both before and afterthe test is administered. In Utah, any inmate whorequests testing is advised that the state health depart-ment will be informed of the results, that anyseropositive inmate can expect stringent administrativesanctions for engaging in intravenous drug use orhomosexual activity, and that seropositive inmatesmay be assigned to special housing units. As discuss-ed above, inmates should be counseled regarding thepotential personal and psychological costs, as well asthe potential benefits, of being tested.Testing in Support of Epidemiological StudiesAs indicated earlier in this chapter, blind epidemio-logical studies may represent a useful (and less costly)alternative to mass screening for determining rates ofHIV infection and assessing the extent of HIVtransmission in institutions. These studies can bedesigned so that test results are never linked to in-dividual inmates. Such studies have already been 74 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESconducted in a number of correctional systems, andothers plan to undertake them in the near future.Testing of Correctional StaffVirtually all of the screening and testing programsidentified in NIJ survey responses involved inmates.Most correctional systems have no involvement in themedical care of staff. In such jurisdictions, any testingof staff is strictly a matter between the staff memberand his or her personal health care provider.Proposals to screen all prospective correctional officersare highly questionable on ethical and legal grounds.Asymptomatic HIV infection certainly does notpreclude satisfactory job performance and thelikelihood of transmission on the job is extremelyremote.Some systems did report that they would test staffmembers who had been involved in incidents duringwhich transmission of the AIDS virus might hate oc-curred. As already noted, Hennepin County (Min-neapolis) Minnesota tested six correctional officerswho had been involved in such incidents. Finally,several sy-'ems noted that they would offer antibodytesting to staff under other circumstances if, for in-stance, they experienced symptoms of ARC or AIDS.In Michigan, the correctional officers union obtaineda commitment from the state that any staff memberwould be provided an antibody test on request.Who Receives Test Results?The important and complex issue of who is notifiedof inmates' HIV antibody test results is discussed inChapter Six, as part of an overall discussion on con-fidentiality and disclosure of AIDS-related medicalinformation.ConclusionThis chapter has discussed the major applications ofHIV antibody testing in the correctional setting andthe perceived advantages and disadvantages of therange of testing options open to correctional ad-ministrators. The most controversial testi-1g applica-tion is mass screening of inmates in the absence ofclinical indications. in the correctional setting, wedefine mass screening as the mandatory testing of allinmates or all new inmates.There are a variety of possible applications for theantibody test besides mandatory mass screening. Theseinclude screening inmates with histories of high-riskbehavior, testing in response to incidents in which8 l transmission of the virus may have occurred, volun-tary testing, testing on request, and testing in supportof epidemiologicalstudies.Finally,correctionalsystems rarely become involved in staff testing, exceptperhaps in response to possible transmission incidents.Proposals to screen all prospective staff members forantibodies to HIV are highly questionable, both legallyand ethically.Twelve state correctional systems have implemeniedor are planning to implement mass screening programsfor inmates; no city or county systems have institutedor planned such programs for inmates. The FederalBureau of Prisons tests all inmates on release and a10 percent random sample of incoming inmates.However, almost all of the jurisdictions responding tothe survey do employ testing for more limited pur-poses, such as when clinically indicated or whenrequested.The issue of mass screening for antibodies to HIV incorrectional institutions has sparked an intense debate,involving the following major questions:Are HIV Antibody Tests Reliable andAccurate?Proponents of mass screening argue thatthe available tests are highly reliable andaccurate, with very few false positive astdnegative results.Opponents point out that there continue tobe serious concerns about false positives,particularly in populations with low truerates of infection (which include most cor-rectional populations in the United Statesand Canada). False negatives, resultingfrom the lag-time between infection andappearance of detectable antibodies as wellas from technical problems with the tests,may also be a -problem, particularly inpopulations with higher true infectionrates. The accuracy problems apply evenwhen the basic ELISA test is repeated t idconfirmed with a Western Blot.Can Mass Screening Prevent Trammissionof HIV?Proponents argue that mass screeningfacilitates policies that will reduce transmis-sion of HIV in correctional facilities, suchas snecial housing, supervision, counseling,and educational programs. In addition,they suggest, staff need to know which in-mates are infected in order to take specialprecautions with them.Opponents reply that it is better to focusprevention and classification strategies oninmates likely to be predatory (perhapstransmitting infection through forced sex-ual activity) or otherwise prone to high-riskbehaviors, rather than trying to identify allinfected inmates, many of whom may notpose behavioral problems. Indeed,knowledge of positive antibody status mayprompt behavior problems. With regard tostaff, critics of mass screening argue thatuniversal precautions should be appliedand that knowledge of inmates' antibodystatus might lead to dangerously carelessdouble standards of precaution.Will Mass Screening Improve MedicalMonitoring and Care?Proponents suggest thatidentifyingseropositives will facilitate timely medicalmonitoring and diagnosis and cost-effectively focus intervention on those in-mates most likely to be in need of suchservices.Opponents argue that it is unfair to sub-ject seropositives to inevitable stigma whenthere is no cure available, and that thereare reason2ble alternatives for the proactiveidentification of inmates at high risk forHIV infection. These include carefulhistory-taking, surveillance and diagnosticprocedures using othc tests which canidentify immuno-suppression.Is It Possible to Maintain the Confidentiali-ty of Antibody Test Results in CorrectionalFacilities and How Does Disclosure ofResults Affect Seropositive Inmates?Proponents of mass screening-argue thatconfidentiality can be maintanic,, by keep-ing test results out of inmate medicalrecords and carefully controlling access toany lists of seropositive inmates.Opponents argue that confidentiality ofsuch sensitive information is imporxible tomaintain in a correctional setting, and thatdisclosure of test results as well as circula-tion of unfounded rumors regardine L.mates' antibody status will inevitably ivatito ostracism, verbal intimidation, andpossibly seriousphysical violence.Disclosure of results could also lead toserious discrimination following discharge.8vScreening and Testing75 What are the Legal Implications of MassScreening?Proponents argue that mass screening islegal and proper and that failure to iden-tify potentially infectious inmates couldraise serious liability problems for thecorrectional system.Opponents argue that mass screening is li-legal in many jurisdictions and that anylegal liabilities could be effectively address-ed by better procedures for the preventionof sexual victimization.How Costly are Mass Screening Programs?Proponents argue that systems can imple-ment screening quite economically by buy-ing test kits or laboratory services on ahigh-volume basis.Opponents resnond that costs may be veryhigh, particularly when periodic followuptesting of seronegatives and separate hous-ing and programming for seropositives areconsidered.Will Mass Screening Support or r-mine the Effects of Edir ;lion and Preven-tion Programs?Proponents of mass screening argue thatpotentially infectious inmates must te iden-tified so that they may be targeted in educa-tion and prevent. nn programs.Critics respond that such differentialeducation programsneedlessly stigmatize ',Ile group of inmateswhile perhaps lulling the others into a falsesense of security. In fact, everyone shouldreceive the same educational messagesregarding -high-risk behaviors.Will Mass Screening Allay or Inflame theFears, of Inmates, Staff, lnd the Public?Proponents suggest that mass screeningcould help to calm the concerns of inmates,staff, and the public if low rates ofseropositivity were found. Moreover,failure to screen might indicate to the 76 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESpublic that the system was failing to ad-dress the problem of AIDS in its facilities.Critics contend that mass screening willneedlessly inflame fears, particularly ifseropositivity rates are found to be high.Is Mass Screening the Best Way to Assessthe Extent of the AIDS Problem in anInmate Population?Proponents argue that mass screening is thebest way to determine the scope of thoproblem lnd is necessary to inform keybudgetary and facility planning decisions.Critics reply that the same information canbe obtained from blind epidemiologicalstudies in which test results are not linkedwith individual inmates, thus avoiding theinevitable stigmatization and ostracism ofidentified and rumored seropositives.Should Correctional Systems be TakingSteps Not Taken in Society at Large?Proponents contend that presumed highrates of infection with and transmission ofHIV in correctional facilities justify themandatory mass screening of inmates.Critics respond that infection rates are lowin many correctional populations and thatavailable evidence also suggests low ratesof HIV transmission among inmates. Evenif screening would produce some reductionin transmission and some improvement inmedical management, opponents empha-size, the same effects can be achieved byeducation, aggressive efforts to prevent vic-timization, and other, less broadly intrusivemeasures. In short, the decision whether toadopt or reject mass screening may notreally pose a dilemma between publichealth considerations and individual rights.Rather, the alternatives to mass screeningmay betterserve bothvitalinterestssimultaneously.Decisions about whether or not to institute massscreening should be based on careful consideration ofthese issues, rather than on the political pressure thathas arisen on the subject. 8a Notes1.

It is the related correctional managementissues where to house and treat the inmate, how toprevent the spread of the infection and how to pay formedical care that may be the most difficult toresolve. In this chapter, we examine many of the waysthat correctional administrators have responded tothese hrtitutional management issues, and we exploresome cf the advantages and disadvantages of theseapproaches.Medical and Psycho-Social ServicesPerhaps the highest priority in the correctionalresponse to AIDS is providing timely, professional andquality medical care to inmates who become ill withthe disease. However, effective medical care must notbe simply reactive; it must also include programs forthe timely detection, diagnosis and regular surveillanceof the full spectrum of reactions to HIV infection.When responding to the challenging problem of AIDSin prisons and jails, administrators must deal with notonly the difficult medical issues; they must also balancemedical considerations and medical advice againstcomplex corre;tional management factors. Wheremedical guidelines and correctional considerations areat odds, difficult decisions must be made in an effortto satisfy both interests to the maximum extent.Detection, Diagnosis 'and MedicalSurveillanceThe basic medical issues posed by AIDS are identicalwithin and outside the correctional institution. Promptdetection and diagnosis are vital to develop the besttreatment plan for each patient. HIV antibody testsmay be used in support of screening and diagnosisefforts, although, as already discussed, they raise manycontroversial medical, ethical, legal, and correctionalmanagement issues. Whether or not antibody testingis used, however, appropriate diagnostic workups(including complete blood count, other Wood work,and anergy screens) are necessary to identi'y im-munosuppression, ARC and AIDS.There are also certain tests that may be able to detectearly evidence of opportunistic infections typically seenin AIDS patients (e.g., the gallium scan for detectingearly Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia).A complete physical examination and history-takingat intake and regular physicals thereafter are keyelements of the effort to diagnose HIV infection ona timely basis. Maryland, North Carolina, Iowa, andother jurisdictions have incorporated specific questionsregarding symptoms of HIV-related illness and high-risk behaviors in their intake medical screening pro-tocol. (Examples of these forms are included inAppendix F.) Thisfacilitatesidentification andmonitoring of inmates who may be experiencing symp-toms of HIV infection and of those who may be atparticular risk for infection. Illinois has a particular-ly aggressive intake screening program which it usesto generate a list of inmates at apparent high risk forHIV infection.1 Some physicians in correctionalsystems believe that attempts to identify inmates at riskfor infection constitute \"labeling\" which may focus un-due attention on \"risk groups\" and detract attentionfrom surveillance for clinical signs and symptoms ofinfection among all inmaiCareful surveillance and regular follow-up are ex-tremely important for patients with AIDS, ARC andasymptomatic HIV infection because serious, life-threatening symptoms can develop very quickly. Manycorrectional agencies have specific protocols forregular follow-up and medical surveillance. For exam-ple, Texas and Indiana conduct monthly follow-up onall seropositive inmates, while Illinois monitors allinmates on its \"high-risk list\" through white bloodcounts and physical examinations every three months.In the San Francisco County Jail, medical staffmonitor pregnant women particularly closely becauseof the risk of perinatal transmission. They are routinelyoffered counseling and anonymous HIV antibodytesting. The details of these protocols may vary, buttheir basic intent is the same: to facilitate timelymedical intervention.Some inmates may be afraid to seek medical attentionfor fear of being stigmatized, or they may be in apsychological denial phase. In such instances, correc-tional officers and other inmates can be valuable alliesin the surveillance process by being watchful for symp-toms and any other signs of illness. Management Issues79 Some correctional systems, including New Jersey's,believe that it is extremely important to maintain acentralized diagnosis and evaluation function for allinmates suspected of having ARC or AIDS. Inconsis-tent theories or practice regarding diagnosis and treat-ment could create confusion, fueling the fears of staffand inmates. New Jersey administrators emphasizethat \"telling a consistent story\" and \"using a commonvocabulary\" are critical to an effective strategy formanaging the AIDS problem within correctionalinstitutions.Medical TreatmentThe nature of medical treatment will depend on theinmate's health as well as on the medical capabilitiesavailable to the correctional system. Many asymp-tomatic inmates and those with ARC require onlyroutine monitoring of their health status. However,inmates with extreme manifestations of AIDS almostinvariably require intensive medical treatment, eitherwithin the correctional system's medical facilities orin a community hospital.The former director or Montefiore MedicalCenter/Rikers Island Health Services in New YorkCity suggests that inmates be made eligible for clinicaltrials of innovative AIDS treatments. This would re-quire a \"compassionate exception\" to the federalregulations restricting human experimentation withprison inmates.AZT and other therapeutic drugs that becomeavailable should be made available to correctionalinmates when medically indicated. Indeed, since AZThas now been approved by the Food and Drug Ad-ministration, it cannot legally be withheld from pa-tients meeting the clinical criteria. However, becauseAZT is extremely expensive, numerous correctionalsystems note that provision of the drug is becominga major cost issue. It is not only the cost of the drug-itself, -but-also-the labor-intensive, around-the-clockschedule of administration, which pose potential prob-lems of cost and logistics. New York state offers AZTto all inmatPc who meet the medical criteria for thedrugnon, iave been denied the medication due tobudget limitations. However, in some other systems,financial constraints have meant that AZT could beoffered to only a Ilmited number of qualified inmates.This policy poses serious legal and ethical issues.Correctional systems with relatively large numbers ofinmate AIDS cases, such as New York and Califor-nia, have established discrete housing and treatmentunits. The head nurse and other staff of the AIDS unitat the California Correctional Medical Facility, 80 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESVacaville, have imen able to establish a supportiveatmosphere for the inmates there.One of New York's AIDS units is in the infirmary atthe Sing Sing Correctional Facility. Here, dedicatedmedical staff and inmate nurse-assistants have alsodeveloped a remarkably caring environment for in-mates with AIDS. Every Mort is made to treat theinmates with humanity and sensitivity arid to providethem with as much comfort as possible, given the in-evitable limitations of a correctional setting. At theSing Sing unit, authorities deliberately avoided aclosed-cell configuration which might promote feel-ings of isolation and persecution, deciding instead onan open ward to encourage camaraderie and mutualassistance among the inmate patients. While there havebeen aifficulties with particular inmates, overall, theunit has been remarkably successful. Staff note thatinmates often arrive in very bad medical condition, butmany go into remission for long periods in the sup -,e atmosphere of the Sing Sing unit.Counseling and Other Psychs- Social ServicesAIDS may present extremely serious psychologicalproblems for those with the disease. Therefore,counseling and support systems are also zri importantcomponent of care. Since AIDS is a fatal disease,persons with AIDS (and those who care for them)should receive counseling on death and dying. Staffat the California Correctional . tedical Facility, forexample, have worked closely with associates of aleading authority on death and dying, ElizabethKubler-Ross, in order to develop knowledge and sen-sitivity in this area.Many other areas should also be addressed in a com-prehensive program of psycho-social services for in-mates with AIDS and HIV infection. For example,persons with AIDS may need support in informingtheir parents of their homosexuality and/or IV druguse, -informing their sexual-partners that they areinfected, or informing friends and neighbors of theirillness. Counselors may also need to help HIV-infectedinmates deal with denial of their illness, suicide issues,feelings of guilt and responsibility, or anger and rageat their disease. Since persons with AIDS need hope,counselors should provide help in gaining access to ex-perimental drugs. Inmates with AIDS may requireassistance with unfinished business, such as debts ant,wills. Finally, decisions should be made regarding theuse of resuscilatcrs or other \"heroic measures\" forthose facing imminent and Texa: have responded to the need forcomprehensive psycho-social services by establishing 9 support teams for each inmate with AIDS, ARC andasymptomatic HIV infection. In Minnesota the teamincludes a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse, chaplain,patient advocate, family member, and correctionalcounselor. Connecticut's correctional system makessocial and psychiatric services, including supportgroups, available to AIDS patients.The Forensic AIDS Project of the San FranciscoDepartment of Public Health provides the followingservices in the San Francisco jail system: individualtherapy; pastoral counseling; counseling for familymembers; and support groups for persons with AIDS,HIV seropositives, family members, and those whohave lost persons close to them to AIDS. Finally, apromising AIDS support group has been initiated ata state prison in Georgia. This group has both helpedto address and ease the personal difficulties of inmateswith AIDS and ARC and raised the general level ofinformation and awareness regarding AIDS amonginmates and staff. It thus serves not only to enhancecare for inmates with AIDS and ARC, but also tosupplement educational programs.3Because of the painful uncertainties involved, counsel-:1,1g may be just as important for HIV seropositives andpersons with ARC as for those with end-stage AIDS.Most jurisdictions provide such counseling to affectedinmates. In addition, it is important to counsel poten-tially infected persons regarding the risks of transmit-ting the infection and the means to preventtransmission.Pre- and post-test counseling for persons undergoingHIV antibody testing are also extremely important.CDC has published guidelines for this counseling,which are included in Appendix E.4 The American RedCross and several states have developed question-and-answer flyers for those being tested for antibodies toHIV. These flyers discuss the meaning of the test andits implications for the individual's future behavior.The Red Cross pamphlet is for individuals withpositive tests. The Oregon state Health Division hasdeveloped two separate pamphlets for counseling thosewho have been tested: one for risk-group memberswith negative tests and the other for all persons withpositive tests. Finally, North Carolina has an exten-sive checklist of required messages and guidance forall inmates with positive tests. All of these items mustbe discussed with the inmates both when they arenotified of test results and prior to discharge. (Thesematerials are included in Appendix D.)Finally, the \"worrie weil\" and those who are afraidof AIDS need corng and support. In San Fran-cisco, the Fo)DS Project conducts supportgroups for the \"worried well\" in the county jails whilein C'hicago, mental health specialists provide individualand h,roup counseling to jail inmates. This counselinghas been very effective in reducing fear and hostilitytoward persons with AIDS.Pre-Release Planning and AftercareInmates with AIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HIV in-fection who are about to be released into the communi-ty require important services as well. First, they needintensive counseling on their responsitilities to notifytheir sexual partners of their niedical status and toavoid any behaviors that may transmit infection toothers. This is, of course, most critical for those withasymptomatic infection and those whose conditionswill not be readily apparent. (Issues regarding thecorrectionalsystem'spossibleresponsibilityfornotification are discussed in Chapter Six.)Second, pre-release planning should ;nclude identifica-tion of and referral to all government b refit prog-amsfor which the inmate may be elk, '^such asMedicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Inaddition, of course, pre-releasees should be referredto appropriate sources of hospice care, hospitalization,outpatient care, counseling and other support servicesin the community. While the correctional system is notresponsible for the actual provision or financing ofthese services, it should ensure that the former inmatehas all the information necessary to obtain them. Cor-rectional systems should never release inmates withHIV infection or AIDS without providing comprehen-sive pre-release planning. North Carolina has con-tracted with a family nurse practitioner who specializesin pre-release planning for inmates with AIDS. Accor-ding to the Department of Corrections, this has beenan effective arrangement.Costs of Care and Associated ServicesResponses-to all-three NIJ surveys show that correc-tional systems are almost universally concerned aboutthe costs of medical care and associated se -cs forinmates with AIDS. However, there are wkie., vary-ing estimates of the costsmedical care t oth withinand outside correctional systems.5Average reported costs of caring for an AIDS caseinside the correctional system ranged from $10,000(Flo' ida and Maryland) to $50,000 for (Illinois), whileaverage costs for care outside the system ranged from$15,000 (South Carolina) to $152,000 (Rhode Island).These figures should be cautiously considered,however, since some are simply estimates and othersare based on one or very few cases. Obviously, costs Management issues 81 can differ dramatically depending on individual pa-tient circumstances.The only agreement seems to be that medical care forAIDS patients is expensive, whether it is provided ina correctional medical facility, in another publicmedical facility, t,I la a hospital in the community. Tileproblem is exacerbated because medical services pro-vided to correctional inmates may not be reimbursedunder Medicaid.Since the early years of the AIDS epidemic, severe !factors have dramatically affected the costs of medkalcare. First, as they learned more about the di-case,physicians came to rely less on extended hospitaliza-tion and to shift more treatment to an outpatient basis.This both reduced the cost and seemed better for thepatient psychologically. San Francisco has pioneeredinnovative case management strategies for personswith AIDS, which include extensive outpatient, in-home, and hospice care services, the combination ofw,.;11 has substantially reduced costs of care. Ofcoarse, some of thesr, treatment modalities are notfeasible for correctional inmates, but substantial costsavings can still be realized in this setting. For exam-ple, in 1985, Maryland reported its annual cost ofhospitalization per inmate with AIDS to he $143,000;in 1987, that figure has been reduced to $10,000.On the other hand, the advent of AZT therapypricedat about0,000 per year per inmate, plus a highlylabor-intensive administration scheduleportends costincreases. Indeed, as noted, many correctional systemscite AZT therapy as a major cost concern.In general, as indicated above, the costs of care willprobably be higher if inmates are placed in hospitalsin the community than if they are retained in correc-tional medical facilitiesor other public medicalfacilities.6 However, a number of factors besideti costwill inform decisions on where to place inmates withAIDS. These include availability and location ofnecessary medical care facilities, numbers of inmatesin the system who require such care, and institutionalsecurity and management issues.To the figures for hospitalization which include allhospital and surgical charges, physicians' services,laboratory fees, and costs of prescription drugs mustbe added costs of ancillary services such as counsel-ing, possible legal advice, increased insurance (unlessthe system is self-insured), and funeral arrangements.Obviously, the total costs of medical care andassociated services for inmates with AIDS could haveserious budgetary implications forcorrectionalsystems. 82 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESIn view of the high cost involved, correctional systemsshould develop as much information as they can,through epidemiological studies (as recommendedearlier in this report) and other means, to project theirfuture numbers of AIDS cases. Such projections willat least help administrators prepare timely requests forbudgets' to cover the costs of medical care andassociated services for those inmates.Housing Policies for Inmates withAIDS, ARC, or Asymptomatic HIVInfectionDeciding where to house and treat inmates who haveAIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HIV infection is oneof the most critical and difficult decisions for correc-tional administrators. Housing decisions may be close-ly tied to policies regarding HIV antibody testing. Forexample, if a correctional system has a policy of man-datory screening, then this may lead to a decision tosegregate, or otherwise separately house, inmatesfound to be antibody positive.Medical considerations as well as correctional manage-ment considerations should bott figure prominentlyin housing decisions. Most jurisdictions place inmateswith confirmed diagnoses of AIDS in a hospital or in-firmary setting, although the duration of suchhospitalization varies considerably dependingclinical circumstances. In addition, preventing thespread of HIV infection within the facility and pro-tecting affected inmates may also be important con-siderations in decisions to separate inmates with AIDSfrom the general population. Finally, the costs of care,availability and location of facilities able to provideappropriate care, costs of any new construction orrenovations necessary to prepare special units, andstaffing of any special AIDS units (correctional as wellas medical) will all affect correctional decisions ontreatment and housing.Correctional administrators have a number of optionsconcerning treatment and housing placements forinmates with AIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HIVinfection.!maintaining inmates in the general popula-tion with no restrictions or special pi o-gra:nming;2. maintaining inmates in the general popula-tion FOR INMATES WITH AIDS, ARC, AND ASYMPTOMATICHIV INFECTION: STATE AND FEDERAL PRISON SYSTEMS (n = 51)a PolicyAIDSJurisdictions Following this Policy for: ARCAsymptomaticHIV Infection n%n010n%Maintain in general population 24%1122%2345%Ma'ntain in general special programmingb5101581325 Hospitalization (within or Administrative segregation/separations918510612 Unspecified segregation/separation 36 1/00Case-bycase determination 275329571733 a This includes hypothetical policies in jurisdictions that as yet have no cases in a particular category.b This category includes single.celling.cThis ..ategory includes housing inmates in iliedial units for admin.strati%c reasons.

For ex-ample, a jurisdiction's basic policy may be to main-tain asymptomatic seropositives and inmates withARC in the general population, but segregate them,if medical, behavioral, or security considerations arise.Such policies would be included under both \"maintainin general population\" and \"case-by-case determina-tion\" in 1 .gures 5.1 - 5.3. Conversely, jurisdictionswhose basic policy is tc hospitalize AIDS cases butreturn them to the geheral population if they go intoremission, would be included both under \"hospitaliza-tion\" and \"case-by-case determination.\"Figures 5.1 - 5.3 reflect a broad diversity of policies,although more jurisdictions have adopted case-by-casedecision-making than was true in past years. Mostsystems still hospitalize or segregate inmates withAIDS; 81 percent of state and federal systems, and 58percent of city and county systems have this policy.Most systems also maintain asymptomatically infectedinmates in the general population, with or withoutspecial programming. This is the policy in 70 percentof state and federal systems, and 66 percent of cityand county systems. Canadian systems also havediverse policies, but most have adopted case-by-casedecision-making.Figure 5.4 further summarizes housing policies accord-ing to mutually exclusive combinations and shows howthese policy combinations have changed since theoriginal survey was taken in 1985.

City and county and Cana-dian jurisdictions arc slightly more likely to usesegregation: 18 percent of ro,,onding city and countyjurisdictions and 25 percent of Canadian systemssegregate all three AIDS-related inmate categories asopposed to only 10 percent of state and fed.ralsystems. Two-thirds of all systems responding in 1987have basic policies involving case-by-case determina-tion of housing.Increasingly, correctional systems are basing housingdecisions or, both medical and security/behavioral con-siderations. This, in turn, is based on the multipleobjectives of providing care consistent with medicalneed, protecting the inmate from harm at the handsof others, and preveLting transmission of HIV withininstitutions. At the same time, however, many correc-tional systems are coming under significant pressureto segregate all asymptomatic seropositives and in-mates with ARC. There has also been significantpressure to restrict work assignments of HIV-infectedinmates.The specific medical and correctional management 84 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESconsiderations involved in each of the major housingo;,tions are examined below.Major Housing OptionsMaintaining Inmates in the GeneralPopulation Without Special ProgrammingDecisions to keep inmates in the general populationinvolve consideration of measures necessary and ap-propriate to protect affected inmates from otherinmates and to minimize the risk of-HIV infectionbeing transmitted. CDC guidelines recommend nospecial housing arrangements for AIDS or ARCpatients except under certain clearly defined medicalcircumstances. These circumstances primarily involveprotection of thepatientfrom other infection ratherthan protecting other people from the patient infec-tion. As shown in Figure 5.4, a number of systraismaintain entire AIDS-related categories of inmates,particularly seropositives, in the general populationwithout any special programming. For example, NewYork City and New York state estimate that theirsystems have significant numbers of seropositiveinmates in the general population. However, largely 'Y Figure 5.3HOUSING POLICIES FOR INMATES WITH AIDS, ARC, AND ASYMPTOMATICHIV INFECTION: CANADIAN SYSTEMS (n = 12)a PolicyAIDSJurisdictions Following this for: ARCAsymptomaticHIV Infection ncrion%Maintain population I8% 18%217%Maintain in populationwith special programmingb00 1800 Hospitalization system)542433325 8 Unspecified segregation/separation 000000Case-by-case determination 650758758 a T:..s includes hypothetical policies in jurisdictions that as yet have no cases in a particular category.6This category includes single - ceiling.cTins category indudes housing inmates in mediwi units for administratio: reasons. This poll,) is general{) intended to protect affectedinmates from other inmates and/or to facilitate their supervision. due to extensive educational programs on AIDS, thishas not occasioned panic regarding transmission ofinfection.A number of other correctional systems (includingIllinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland; Massachusetts,Virginia and Washington) maintain all asymptomaticseropositives and inmates with ARC in the generalpopulation without special restrictions. A few systems(such as Michigan and Oregon) presumptively houseall three categories of HIV-infected inmates in thegeneral population, unless an Ldividual's medicalneeds, safety, or high-risk behavior dictate otherwise.It is more common, however, to segregate AIDS casesbut presumptively house seropositives and inmateswith ARC in general population, with provision fortheir segregation on a case-by-case basis if they displayhigh-risk behavior or a need for protection or medicalconditions that calls for separate housing. Florida,Iowa, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons follow thispolicy.Maintaining Inmates in the GeneralPopulation with Special ProgrammingIn a number of systems, asymptomatically infectedinmates and those with ARC are maintained in thegeneral population, but with special programmingdesigned to reduce the possibility that they willtransmit HIV to others. In Texas and Nevada, forexample, these inmates are housed together in doublecells, while in Nebraska and New Hampshire, they aresingle-celled. Obviously, policy decisions in this areadepend upon the degree of overcrowding in the facility.Some systems, such as California, house all general-population inmates in double cells while in New Yorkstate all celled inmates have their own cells. Dormitoryhousing with double-bunks is also prevalent in manysystems with prison overcrowding problems; such asFlorida, while in other systems, including New York,all dormitory housing is in single- bunk cubicles. A lackor shortage of single-cell housing in general popula-tion may lead a system to decide on segregatingseropositives and/or inmates with ARC. Even if single-ceiling is available on a limited basis, placing all HIV-infected inmates in single cells would be tantamount Management Issues85 Figure 5.4HOUSING POLICY COMBINATIONSa State/Federal Categories Categories 24120026No 816001300Combinations Involving Other Policy Combinations 48123913Total 5110107ob511010/ob33101%b331 00 5o aFor the purposes of this categorization, segregation means that the bask pi,;1%.) is to hospitalize (either of inmate, regardless of v,hethet returned to the general population when their symptomssubside.bDue to rounding. to announcing their identities to staff and other in-mates. Systems choosing this option :trust consider theimpact of this notification on the infected inmates'safety in the general population.In many correctional systems (45 percent offederal/state systems, 36 percent of city/countysystems, and 25 percent of Canadian systems) the workassignments of inmates with ARC and/or those withasymptomatic HIV infection are restricted. For exam-ple, in Nebraska and Nevada, these inmates are ex-cluded from food service assignments. In othercorrectional systems, HIV-infected inmates are exclud-ed from medical, dental and laundry duties. Correc-tional systems generally acknowledge that restrictionson work assignments are not medically indicated: thelikelihood of transmission in any of these assignmentsis extremely remote. Nevertheless, restrictions on theseassignments have been instituted to forestall any poten-tial alarm. Nevada and some other correctionalsystems also exclude infected inmates from workrelease programs in the community, in order to main-tain public support for the programs.86 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESSystems should carefully weigh medical and correc-tional considerations before instituting such restric-tions.Unnecessarily extreme precautions mayundermine educational programs designed to convinceinmates anl staff that the AIDS virus is only transmit-ted through sexual activity and blood-to-blood con-tact. Indeed, an inmate raised such a concern at anAIDS training session observed during this study.After the physician had finished her presentation onthe means of transmission, including the point thatthere have been no cases of infection attributed tofood, the inmate asked: \"Then why are infectedinmates not permitted to work in food service?\" Thephysician was not able to provide a sound answer tothe question, which may well have fostered suspicionamong the attendees as to the real risk of HIV infec-tion associated with food.Segregation: Medical and AdministrativeEvery jurisdiction places inmates with confirmeddiagnoses of AIDS in some hospital or infirmary set-ting when they are seriously ill. A variety of treatment settings are used for inmates with AIDS. Some statesplace all inmates with AIDS in hospitals in the com-munity (New Jersey), while others maintain them incorrectional medical facilities (California, FederalBureau of Prisons) and still others use both communityhospitals and correctional medical facilities (New Yorkstate). In several states, however, there have beendifficulties finding community hospital placements forinmates with AIDS. At least two jurisdictions havecentralized the treatment of all inmates with AIDS ina single correctional medical facility (California:Vacaville; and New York City: Rikers IslandHospital). All inmates with confirmed AIDS in thesejurisdictions are permanently admitted to the central-ized medical facility.States which use hospital facilities for treatment willoften admit AIDS cases when they are acutely ill butreturn them to a special unit in the correctional facilitywhen they are in remission. This has proved to be acost-effective approach.Within medical facilities, some jurisdictions havepolicies involving medical isolation and quarantine ofinmates with AIDS. Such policies run counter toCDC's guidelines for care of AIDS patients. Theseguidelines state that, in most instances, medical isola-tion is not necessary. Private rooms are indicated on-ly when the patient is too ill to use good hygiene (e.g.,suffers from profuse diarrhea or fecal incontinence)or displays altered behavior as a result of centralnervous system infection.? Connecticut and other statesystems have explicit policies against isolation of AIDSpatients unless it is medically indicated.Though hospital and infirmary settings are generallydesigned for medical treatment and evaluation, somejurisdictions also use these facilities to separate inmateswith AIDS from the general correctional population,to protect them from retribution, and to prevent themfrom infecting others. Some jurisdictions (includingFlorida, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, and Maryland)permanently segregate confirmed AIDS cases in suchsettings immediately upon diagnosis. Still others (in-cluding Maine and Oklahoma) permanently place bothAIDS and ARC cases in administrative segregation.Finally, a few correctional systems (including Califor-nia, Texas, and Colorado) permanently segregate allthree categories of HIV-infected inmates.There is significant disagreement regarding segrega-tion policies. Most correctional systems take the posi-tion that, while it may be necessary to segregateconfirmed AIDS cases permanently, it is unnecessaryto segregate seropositives or inmates with ARC exceptwhen dictated by specific medical, behavioral, orLsecurity considerations. According to the infectiousand communicable diseases coordinator of the NewYork state correctional system, it is unfair to subjectthese inmates to the stigma of segregation in theabsence of a cure for HIV infection. Indeed, as willbe discussed below, New York has recently changedits policy on confirmed AIDS cases from permanentsegregation to \"mainstreaming\" them (returning themto general population) when they are in remission.Other correctional systems argue that there is goodreason to segregate all HIV-infected inmates. InCalifornia, all of these inmates are housed in one wingat the Correctional Medical Facility at Vacaville.Correctionalof:icialsassertthatthisclusteringfacilitates delivery of the same correctional programsoffered to all other inmates and makes it possible toprovide all of these segregated inmates with medicaland psycho-social services by highly experienced staff.Moreover, this arrangement makes it easier to protectinfected inmates from other inmates who may wish toharm them. Officials state that, for this reason, theinfected inmates themselves desire to be segregated.Further, segregation may prevent infected inmatesfrom transmitting HIV to others. This latter motiva-tion is closely tied to concerns regarding the system'spotential liability for any infections that may occur inits facilities. It may be problematic, however, to clusterall HIV-infected inmates without respect to otherclassification considerations. It is probably preferableto place infected inmates in different housing units ac-cording to whether or not they are actively ill.Development of separate housing units for infected in-dividuals may have considerable impact on correc-tional costs. Single-celling, development of separateunits, and medical isolation are all expensive, especiallyif these placements are used for asymptomaticseropositives and inmates with ARC. Moreover, it iscostly and complicated to provide equal programmingto inmates in such special units. Failure to provideequal programming may result in lawsuits. On theother hand, advocates of segregation argue that, byreducing HIV transmission, it will save the correctionalsystem substantial costs associated with the medicalcare of inmates with AIDS.Returning Inmates in Remission to theGeneral PopulationOnce inmates are separated from the general popula-tion, it may be difficult to send them back, as thismight cause concern among other inmates and staff.Still, there are cases of such policy changes beingimplemented without causing great difficulty. Forexample, in Michigan an inmate with AIDS was53Management Issues87 medically segregated but then returned to the generalpopulation witliout incident when his disease went intoremission. Michigan officials emphasize the impor-tance of a concerted and continuous education pro-gram and the cooperation of the correctional officers'union in achieving this success.In New York state, a recent policy change encouragesreturning inmates with AIDS in remission to thegeneral population. This policy has been implementedgradually, in order to minimize fear. One approachhas bees to mainstream these inmates at other facilitieswhere they will not be generally known to have AIDS.Another strategy is to reintegrate each inmate into thesame institution gradually over several months. Forexample, an inmate may first return to religious ser-vices while still living in the infirmary and then, sometime later, return to vocational programs, and, final-ly, return to general population housing. At one NewYork maximum-security facility, the inmates in a voca-tional shop actually petitioned for the return to workof an inmate with AIDS in remission. The inmate waspeacefully returned to work.8Case-by-Case DeterminationAs noted earlier, survey results reveal a continuingtrend away from blanket segregation policies, par-ticularly for asymptomatic seropositives and inmateswith ARC. The movement is toward case-by-casedetermination, based on a range of considerations,including the inmate's medical situation, safety, andlikelihood of infecting others. Blanket segregationpolicies were more common early in the epidemic andgenerally represented a first reaction to the problem.With a period of time to consider all of the facets ofHIV infection in the correctional setting, most systemshave shifted to a case-by-case approach.Some jurisdictions, including Kansas, Michigan, andSouth Carolina, make all housing and programmingdecisions case-by-case, on the basis of medical andsecurity considerations. Michigan's policy, which isparticularly well-conceived, is included in AppendixG. In summary, the policy states that \"HIV-infectedprisoners who do not require inpatient care will beeligible for general population housing at any institu-tion which can meet their health care and securityneeds, and will also be eligible for any programmingand work assignment which their health and behaviorallows.\" As an alternative to inflexible segregationpolicies, Michigan has implemented an extensive pro-gram for identifying and monitoring high-riskbehaviors and making timely housing and program-ming decisions for inmates exhibiting such behaviors.9 88AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESThis requires meetings between the institution headand medical director at least monthly to review theconduct of prisoners known to be infected andprisoners believed to be engaging in high-risk behavior.Oregon and Pennsylvanian) also base housing decisionson a comprehensive assessment of each inmate'smedical needs and behaviors.According to the Oregon Correctional Division'shealth services director, the state's policy is that \"sincenon-infected individuals can avoid the major risk ofexposure to the AIDS virus by abstaining from [sex-ual activity and needle-sharing], it is not medicallynecessary to separate infected individuals to avoidspread of the disease.\" However, individual decisionshave been made to segregate particular inmates fortheir own protection, to prevent panic among theinmates, or in response to certain medical conditions.11 Several systems, including the Federal Bureau ofPrisons, Iowa, and Indiana specifically prescribesegregated or separated housing for seropositive in-mates who give evidence of predatory or other high-risk behavior. The Federal Bureau of Prisons hasdeveloped an elaborate hearing, appeal, and reviewprocess for its decisions.12Conversely, New York state, New York City, SanFrancisco, and Los Angeles, among other jurisdic-tions, take special care to identify prisoners who mightbe victimized and to offer them special housing fortheir own protection. Obviously, sexual assault is ofheightened concern because of the possibility of HIVtransmission in such events. Los Angeles, San Fran-cisco, and New York City have separate jail units forhomosexual men. In San Francisco, inmates requestingseparate housing are also placed in this unit. In NewYork state, the correctional system's basic strategy forpreventing rape is to identify and separately houseprisoners who may be victimized because they are ofsmall stature, are overtly homosexual, or display otherbehavioral characteristics which may put them at risk.This policy, in conjunction with aggressive programsto identify, carefully supervise, and, if necessary,segregate potential predators, may be able to minimizeor even eliminate the possibility of HIV infectionthrough forced sexual activity. However, this can onlywork in the context of case-by-case housing decisions.Case-by-case determination recognizes that each caseis unique. It allows the flexibility to shape particularresponses to the medical and non-medical character-istics of particular cases. On the other hand, the sub-jective judgments which may be made under acase-by-case approach and the lack of uniform policies 100i I linked to clear AIDS-related categories of inmates maycause concern among staff, other inmates, or publicofficials. Intensive educational programs should beable to allay such concerns.A policy based on case-by-case decisionmaking mayalso be more vulnerable to legal challenges on the basisof adequacy and equitability of treatment. However,such problems should be minimized by careful atten-tion to the medical and non-medical characteristics ofeach case.Precautionary and PreventiveMeasuresCorrectional agencies have instituted a wide range ofprecautionary measures to control the spread of AIDSwithin institutions. Some of these measures, especial-ly those based on CDC guidelines for the preventionof-HIV transmission in health-care and other work-place settings, offer excellent protection while minimiz-ing cost and inconvenience within the institution.(Examples of correctional policies in this area are in-cluded in Appendix G.) Others go well beyond theCDC guidelines and are probably unnecessary andinappropriate.Universal PrecautionsCDC has promulgated guidelines for health-careworkers and others who may come into contact withHIV-infected persons on the job.13 Many jurisdictionshave made these CDC guidelines a part of their cor-rectional policy regarding AIDS.The CDC guidelines emphasize universal precautions:that is, Isjince medical history and examinationcannot reliably identify all patients infected with HIVor other blood-borne pathogens, blood and body fluidprecautions should be consistently used for all pa-tients.\" This recommendation applies equally to cor-rectional officers and inmates, as well as to all personsinvolved in law enforcement or other public safetywork.These precautions are similar to those recommendedfor preventing infection with Hepatitis-B. As noted inChapter One, since HIV is less hardy and more dif-ficult to transmit than the Hepatitis-B virus,14 precau-tions designed to prevent transmission of Hepatitis-Bshould be more than sufficient to prevent transmis-sion of HIV. Measures beyond those recommended forHepatitis-B are considered unnecessary and inap-propriate for addressing the HIV risk.The complete CDC guidelines are included in Appen-dix E to this report, but the following summarizes theprecautionary measures recommended, with someadaptation to the correctional setting:avoid needlesticks and other sharp instru-ment injuries;wear gloves when contact with blood orbody fluids is likely;use disposable shoe coverings if gross bloodcontamination is encountered;establish a \"self-help barrier\" by keeping allcuts and open wounds covered with cleanbandages;avoid smoking, eating, drinking, nail-biting, and all hand-to-mouth, hand-to-nose, and hand-to-eye actions while work-ing in areas contaminated with blood orbody fluids;wash hands thoroughly with soap andwater after removing gloves and after anycontact with blood or body fluids;clean up any spills of blood or body fluidsthoroughly and promptly, using a 1:10household bleach dilution;clean all possibly contaminated surfacesand areas with a 1:10 household bleachdilution;place all possibly contaminated clothingand other items in clearly identified, imper-vious plastic bags;avoid sharing toothbrushes, razors or otheritems that might transmit blood.In addition to its guidelines for clinical staff, CDC hasrecently promulgated similar universal precautions fordental workers.15 Several correctional systems havealso implemented these precautions not because ofpossible exposure to saliva, but because of the poten-tial exposure to blood involved in scaling proceduresand other routine dental work. Florida and othersystems nave recommended universal precautions fordental workers.All correctional agencies should develop and enforcewritten policies and procedures regarding precau-tionary measures and protective equipment. Uniform,reasonable, and consistently applied policies help toeliminate confusion and avoid unnecessary incidentsresulting from overreaction or misinformation. TheWisconsin correctional system has developed a com-prehensive infection control policy and carries outregular assessments of compliance with that policy inall its institutions. Figure 5.5 shows that most correc- 1 01Management Issues89 Figure 5.5WRITTEN PRECAUTIONARY ITLICIES of Spills Handling 39762782867 tional support systems have adopted written precau-tionary policies in certain key areas, including gloves,CPR, clean-up of blood and body fluid spills, andneedle handling. Search procedures such as use ofgloves, mirrors, and flashlights should be incor-porated into all systems' precautionary policies.The California Department of Corrections has issueda useful set of precautionary policies for its staff. Thiscovers protective apparel, cell and body searches, con-trol of inmate disturbances, dealing with aggressive orviolent inmates, clean-up of blood or body-fluid spills,and other relevant topics.16 (This policy is included inAppendix G.) Correctional departments should issueprotective latex or rubber gloves for staff to carry atall times. In many systems, officers have belt pouchesin which to carry gloves. However, in several systems,gloves are not issued to individual officers but onlymade available at key locations. One institutionalsuperintendent argued that individual issuance ofgloves would only cause concern among staff.However, it appears that the arguments for issuanceof gloves to individuals outweigh those raised inopposition.Judgment in ImplementationPrecautionary measures should always be commen-surate with the risk involved. Obviously, correctionalpersonnel cannot predict with certainty when they willencounter blood or body fluids in the course of theirduties. In almost any situation, there may he the poten-tial for such contact. However, it would be an over-reaction to wear gloves at all times. This could also 90 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESundermine the critical educational message that HIVinfection is not transmitted by casual contact.Instead, correctional staff should exercise their pro-fessional judgment as to when there is a reasonablelikelihood of contact with 'toed or body fluids andexercise reasonable care in those situations, just as theydo in addressing the other types of risks common intheir work.Response to Specific SituationsFights and AssaultsWhen suddenly confronted with an altercation inwhich contact with blood or body fluids may occur,a correctional officer must quickly make a critical deci-sion. \"Should I intervene?\", and, if so, \"Should I stopto put on gloves before intervening?\" Correctionalstaff in some systems seem to have adopted an infor-mal policy of non-intervention for fear of infection.However, this does not constitute an appropriatedischarge of the officer's responsibilities.The California Department of Corrections' policystates that staff \"must assess each incident as to theurgency of the situation\" and take appropriate action.In a non-life threatening situation, officers are directedto put on gloves. In a life-threatening situation, thefirst responding staff member will determine the needfor gloves. However, when blood is present and aninmate is combative or threatening to staff, glovesmust always be worn.17 It is also important to avoidstriking individuals in the mouth, or indeed, to avoidany hand-to-mouth contact, because this is likely toresult in bleeding. These recommendations should be102 useful, but professional skill and judgment are still re-quired in facing such situations.Human BitesAs discussed in Chapter One, the risk of infectionthrough human bites is very low. However, the follow-ing simple precautions will minimize the risk of HIVand other infection as well as promote basic hygiene:1. encourage \"backbleeding\" by applyingpressure and \"milking the wound\", as witha snakebite;2. wash the area thoroughly with soap andhot water; and3. seek medical attention as soon as possible.HIV antibody testing of the victim and perpetrator ofthe bite may be appropriate. However, there is alwaysthe possibility of a false negative result. Therefore,knowledge of antibody status of either or both of theindividuals involved in the incident should not changethe medical response to the victim's case: the samesurveillance and care of the wound should be under-taken in all instances.Body and Cell SearchesAlthough the risk of HIV infection from being cut orpunctured by contaminated needles or other sharp in-struments is very low, many correctional personnel areconcerned about such incidents. Cuts, needlesticks,and puncture wounds may be sustained by officerswhile searching inmates or cells, or while handlingsharp items in a variety of situations. There is par-ticular concern regarding searches of areas where sharpobjects may be hidden from view such as spacesbeneath bunks and the pockets of clothing. Thefollowing precautionary measures will helptominimize the risk of infection:whenever possible, ask inmates to emptytheir own pockets;whenever possible, use long-handled mir-rors and flashlights to search hidden areas;if it is necessary to search manually, alwayswear protective gloves and feel very slowlyand carefully; anduse puncture-proof containers to storesharp instruments and clearly markedplastic bags to store other possibly con-taminated items.Latex gloves are currently the only type suitable forconducting searches. Although they can provide someprotection against sharp instruments, latex gloves arenot puncture-proof. Moreover, there is a direct trade-off between level of protection and manipulability. Inother words, the thicker the gloves, the more protec-tion they afford but the less effective they are inlocating objects. Agencies should select the thicknessof glove which provides the best balance of protectionand search efficiency.Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)Correctional personnel are also concerned about in-fection with HIV through administration of CPR.Agencies should respond to these concerns by em-phasizing theresearch showing the extremeunlikelihood of HIV transmission through saliva. Atthe same time, agencies should make protective masksor airways available to officers and provide trainingin their proper use. Devices with one-way valves toprevent the patient's saliva or vomitus from enteringthe caregiver's mouth are clearly preferable. Califor-nia state law now requires training on CPR masks withone-way valves for all peace officers, including cor-rectional officers.Blood or Body Fluid SpillsAll spills should be promptly cleaned up using a 1:10solution of household bleach. \"Clean-up\" kits are nowcommercially available and \"spill kits\" are manufac-tured by the Corrections Industries Program inWisconsin. The commercial clean-up kits include agranular absorbent which contains bleach. This is tobe poured on the spill and allowed to absorb it, andthen swept up and discarded in a special imperviousbag. Next, an aerosol bleach is sprayed on the area,allowed to sit for ten minutes and wiped up with anabsorbent towel. Finally, the staff member washes hisor her hands with an antiseptic rinse. All equipmentnecessary for the complete clean-up operation is in-cluded in the kit. The California Department of Cor-rections has purchafxd these clean-up kits for manyof its institutions.Unnecessary Preventive MeasuresSome correctional agencies have instituted protectivemeasures which go far beyond those recommended byCDC. Many of these measures are designed to limitexposure under extremely unusual circumstances or toprevent exposure through casual contact. Precau-tionary measures addressing very rare or casual modesof contact, even if implemented in a good faith effortto reduce the fears of staff and inmates, may ultimatelyincrease those fears by encouraging the view that theinfection is transmitted by the sorts of unusual orManagement Issues91 casual contact they address. Such a conflict betweeneducational messages and practical measures may notonly increase fear within the institution, but also fostersuspicion of the correctional system for, in effect,saying one thing about the transmission of HIV butdoing something else. No special clothing are necessaryfor correctional staff except gloves and, in the case ofgross body fluid contamination, masks and gowns.CDC recommends no special handling of the laundryand linen of persons with HIV infection or AIDS andno separate toilet or shower facilities. Finally, becausethere is no evidence that HIV can be transmittedthrough food, CDC recommends no special provisionsfor food service and no special handling of utensilsused in the preparation or service of meals for infectedinmates.Restrictions on Inmate Visitation PrivilegesSome correctional systems restrict the visitation rightsof HIV-infected inmates. California, New York, andMississippi exclude all infected inmates from conjugalvisits. This policy was recently upheld in a New Yorklawsuit.18Availability of Condoms for InmatesThere has been a great deal of discussion regardingwhether condoms should be made available to correc-tional inmates. Most systems have resisted this step (asthey hz..! resisted distribution of clean needles orbleach to sterilize needles) on the grounds that it wouldcondone or even encourage prohibited and, in somejurisdictions, illegal activity. Moreover, many correc-tional officials also believe that condoms would beused to make weapons and to conceal drugs and othercontraband.Nevertheless, three correctional systems Vermont,New York City, and Mississippi are now making con-doms available to inmates. Vermont was the firstcorrectional system to take this step. In announcingtheir decision, Vermont officials stated that the systemwas not thereby condoning homosexual activity amonginmates, only acknowledging that it occurred and,given that fact, taking a logical step to prevent HIVinfection. In Vermont, condoms are only availablethrough medical staff after counseling on high-riskbehaviors.This is the same approach taken by the New York CityDepartment of Corrections. After conducting a studywhich demonstrated a significant number of cases ofrectal gonnorhea contracted by New York City jail in-mates while incarcerated which in turn demonstrated 92 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESthat homosexual activity was occurring the cityhealth department recommended that condoms bemade available in all city jails. This policy was initiallyestablished for the gay unit on Riker's Island, but itwill soon be extended to the entire system. As in Ver-mont, condoms are only available through medicalstaff. In New York City, there have been no reportedproblems with condoms being used as weapons or toconceal contraband. Finally, in Mississippi, condomsare sold in institutional canteens. This state's policysummarizes well the case for condom availability:Realizing that preventive programming willnot eliminate irresponsible sexual behaviorin the inmate population and acknowledg-ing the recommendations of the SurgeonGeneral of the United States of Americathat condoms will help prevent sexualtransmission of HIV infection, condomusage should therefore be advocated by anycredible and responsible education/preven-tion program. Consistent with these con-cerns condoms will be made available.19Several other jurisdictions, including Washington, andthe Canadian federal correctional system, make con-doms available for conjugal visits but not for use inthe institution. California does not furnish condomsfor family visits, but permits spouses to bring theirown. Finally, some correctional systems, includingthose in New York City and San Francisco, providecondoms to inmates on release. All New York Cityreleasees receive a \"discharge kit,\" which includesAIDS prevention brochures, a card with AIDS hotlinetelephone numbers, and two condoms.ConclusionThis chapter has discussed four key areas of policy:medical management, counseling and psycho-socialservices, housing policy, and precautionary measures.Major findings and recommendations include thefollowing:Quality medical care should be providedto all inmates infected with HIV. AIDSpatients, in particular, need humane andsupportive care and access to AZT andother therapeutic drugs as indicated.Emphasis should be placed on proactiveidentification and monitoring of inmates athigh risk of HIV infection and AIDS. Thisshould be done through comprehensive in-take screening and regular follow-up. Comprehensive psycho-social services andpre-release planning are also essential forinmates with asymptomatic HIV infection,ARC and AIDS. This must include pre-and post-test counseling and guidance onresponsible behavior to avoid the infectionof others.Costs of care for inmates with AIDS arevery high,but may be reduced byeliminating unnecessary hospitalizations.At the same time, such reductions may becounterbalanced by the high cost of AZT,which is becoming a major correctionalcost concern.Most correctional systems still segregate orhospitalize inmates with AIDS, but therehas been a noticeable trend away fromblanket segregation of asymptomatic sero-positives and inmates with ARC. Systemsshould consider case-by-case housing andprogramming decisions based on the in-mate's medical situation, need for protec-tion, and likelihood of engaging inbehaviors that may place others at risk.Correctional systems should establish\"universal precautions\" for blood and bodyfluids. That is, unprotected contact withthe blood or body fluids of everyoneshould be avoided.Reasonable and consistent precautionaryprocedures should be established to helpstaff safely deal with a variety of situa-tions, including altercations, blood spills,searches, CPR, and biting incidents.Correctional systems should not adoptprecautionary measures beyond thoserecommended by CDC for clinical staff.Several correctional systems currentlymake condoms available to inmates ininstitutions, emphasizing that this is not tocondone prohibited behavior but only torecognize that it occurs and to provide forreasonable risk reduction. Other correc-tional systems may wish to assess this ex-perience in reaching their own policydecisions.Notes 1.Illinois Department of CorrectionsMedical Services, AIDSManual,Section VI: Screening, Identification and Surveillanceof High Risk Individuals.2.Beverly Abplanalp-Gaede and George L.

It also discusses a range of legalissues involved in a rapidly growing caselaw on AIDSin correctional funks, key labor relations issues, andrecent relevant legislative developments.Notification and ConfidentialityDecisions regarding who should receive inmates' HIVantibody test results and who should be notified re-garding inmates' diagnoses of AIDS or ARC are dif-ficult and complex. Although both inmates andcorrectional staff have asserted legal claims of a rightto know test results (based on perceived health risksassociated with not knowing), seropositive individualshave conversely asserted claims of a right to privacy.While too few cases have been decided to offer a firmanswer, it is fair to my that indiscriminate circulationof inmates' HIV antibody test results to staff offersfew benefitsand may entail a risk of liability.Decisions regarding confidentiality and disclosure areoften governed by legal and policy standards, such asrequirements for written authorization to release testresults or other medical records. Where law or policyallow any discretion, decisions regarding disclosureversus confidentiality invariably raise the question ofwhich should take precedence: the inmate's right tohave medical information kept confidential or the cor-rectional system's perceived legal and moral respon-sibility to protect its staff and other inmates, as wellas the public, from HIV infection. There are validclaims on both sides of the argument. On the onehand, it is often argued that correctional managementneed to know test results to make informed classifica-tion and programming decisions. In addition, line cor-rectional officers argue that they have a right to knowwhen they are dealing with inmates who may beinfectious or who have a serious communicabledisease. Notification to public health departments andinmates' former and/or subsequent correctionalsystems may also be considered important to facilitatetreatment, prevention measures, and contact tracing.Such disclosures may also be designed to reduce oreliminate the correctional system's legal liability shoulda released or transferred inmate transmit HIV infec-tion to others.On the other hand, the most compelling reason formaintaining confidentiality is that persons known tohave AIDS, ARC, or asymptomatic HIV infectionmay suffer ostracism, threats and possibly violentintimidation while in prison; and discrimination inemployment, housing, and insurance coverage afterdischarge from prison. Moreover, if \"universal\" bloodand body fluid precautions are being followed,knowledge of antibody status may be not only un-necessary but also dangerous. If correctional officersthink they know who all the infected inmates are, theymay be lulled into a false sense of security with regardto the inmates they think are uninfected. In short, adouble standard of precaution may be encouraged.Because of their rapid population turnover rates, jailsface even more difficult policy decisions and lutsticalproblems regarding disclosure and confidentiality ofmedical information.Overview of NIJ Survey ResultsFigure 6.1 summarizes the survey results regardingdisclosure of HIV antibody test results. This showsthat many systems limit notification to the inmate andmedical staff, but a significant number of systems alsoinform correctional management and/or public healthdepartments. (In some jurisdictions notification to thepublic health departments isrequired by law.)However, very few correctional systems (18 percent ofstate/federal systems in the United States, 3 percentof city/county systems, and 25 percent of Canadiansystems) notify line correctional officers of antibodytest results.Below, we discuss the range of options regardingdisclosure of all types of AIDS-related medical infor-mation. The discussion references relevant legal andpolicy requirements.Range of Options Regarding Who ReceivesInformationVery Restrictive ProvisionsIn many states, including California, Florida, Illinois,Massachusetts, Oregon, and Wisconsin, there are veryrestrictive laws regarding disclosure of HIV antibodytest results. Under California law, only the subject mayreceive the results of the test unless he or she gives writ-ten authorization for others to receive them. Writtenconsent isrequired for each separate disclosure.Moreover, the law specifies that no one can be com-pelled to identify the subject or divulge the results of 10tConfidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 95 Figure 6.1POLICIES REGARDING DISCLOSURE OF INMATES' HIVANTIBODY TEST Officers 918 13325Public Health 27531339650 Department a1ncludes immediate disclosures and disclosures on transfer/discharge. any test in a legal action without the written consentof the subject. Test results are not subject to disclosureunder California's employee \"right-to-know\" law.Finally, in California, test results may not be usedto reach any decision regarding employment orinsurability.Under Wisconsin's law, the only legal recipients of testresults are the subject, the subject's Ithlth-care pro-vider, laboratory personnel and other staff of health-care facilities, and the state epidemiologist. Anydisclosure to others requires a court order. In statessuch as California and Wisconsin, correctional staffother than health care personnel may not be legallyauthorized to obtain test results.To maximize confidentiality protection, it may be ad-visable to have HIV antibody testing of inmates doneat one of the-CDC-funded alternative test sites whichare located nationwide. All testing at these sites isanonymous; no names are recorded and results canonly be obtained by using a code number known tothe subject alone. However, there are serious practicalproblems with this approach. Moreover, results oftesting done in response to clinical indications wouldgenerally have to be available to medical staff. Thefollowing paragraphs describe some other options for 96AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESaddressing confidentiality issues in the correctionalsetting.Role of Medical StaffMedical staff in particular, the inmate's attendingphysician have an obvious need to know HIV anti-body test results. The information may be importantfor diagnostic and treatment purposes. Correctionalmedical staff also have a critical role to play in pro-tecting the confidentiality of this information, and,indeed, of all medical information regarding individualpatients. The only exceptions to the maintenance ofconfidentiality for information regarding HIV infec-tion should arise from serious safety or securityconsiderations.A number of correctional systems have adoptedpolicies which strictly limit the disclosure of informa-tion on HIV infection. Illinois's policy states that\"divulging or sharing of information with non-medicalstaff may result in disciplinary action. Patient con-fidentiality is an ethical obligation and must be strictlyadhered to by all staff.\"'Medical staff in correctional systems have developedseveral strategies for maintaining confidentiality. NewYork state keeps no lists of infected imnates, makes .107 no entries regarding HIV infection in medical records,and in no way flags medical records of infected in-mates. In New Mexico, the word AIDS does notappear in an inmate's medical record unless and untilfinal diagnosis. Alaska's policy is to request HIVantibody tests by identifying number unrelated to theinmate's normal identification number. No namesappear on the blood samples, and the linkage betweeninmate names and identifying numbers is kept lockedin the secure area where controlled drugs are Jtorea.If correctional systems do keep lists of infected inmatesand, as will be discussed below, some do it isabsolutely critical that these lists be kept locked insecure locations. It should be impossible for inmatesworking in the medical facility, correctional officers,or any other unauthorized persons to obtain access tosuch a list or to individual medical records.Notification of Correctional Authorities andCorrectional OfficersMany correctional authorities and correctional officersargue that they need to know the results of HIV anti-body tests in order to make classification and pro-gramming decisions and to protect themselves againstinfection in their day-to-day interactions with inmates.The arguments for and against mass screening ofinmates for antibodies to HIV have already beendiscussed (see Chapter Four), as well as the keyarguments for and against widespread disclosure tocorrectional staff. As noted above, very few correc-tional systems have policies for the routine notifica-tion of correctional officers.Selecteddisclosureswillprobably be required,however, for certain carefully defined purposes. Twokey decisions are really involved:1. Who receives information? and2. What information do they receive?Possible answers to both of these questions run fromthe very specific to the very vague, and from the veryrestrictive to the very broad. Correctional systemsshould define as precisely as possible both the infor-mation and the recipients. Vagueness inevitably causesproblems. Nevertheless, many correctional systemshave overbroad policies regarding disclosure of infor-mation on HIV infection.Several state correctional systems provide informationor lists of infected ;ninntes to institution superinten-dents and leave it to their discretion to decide who elseshould be notified. The assumption is that this poll.results in disclosure to cor.ztional officers who workdirectly with the inmate. Some jurisdictions simplyhave adopted the policy that information will be sharedwith those who have a \"need to know\". This begs thequestion, because there is significant disagreementabout precisely who has such a need.Other correctional systems have attempted to developmore specific policies. In Vermont, the institutionalsuperintendent is informed of all positive HIV anti-body tests, but that information is to oe shared withother staff members only if one of the followingcriteria is met:1. There is reason tc believe the offender isprone to aggressive or violent behaviortoward staff, or2. There are specific medical considerationswhich might place the staff at unnecessaryrisk.2Wisconsin's policy is similar, but it specifically coversdisclosures in the event of a possible transmissionincident. In such cases, there appears to be a strongcase for disclosure, particularly if the incident in-volved an aggressive act by the infected inmate. In-deed, as discussed in Chapter Four, airtight lawsagainst forced testing and disclosure of results maysoon be modified to allow for testing and disclosurefollowing potential transmission incidents.In Michigan, the institution head is informed when aninfected inmate is identified, but tl :e specific diagnosisis not disclosed. Rather, Michigaa focuses on \"be-haviors which need to be eliminated\". Accordingly,the institution head and medical director meet on atleast a monthly basis to review the conduct of allinfected inmates and all inmates displaying high-riskbehaviors.3Some correctional systems, including Iowa's, havemade specific provision for disclosure to officers whoare transporting an infected inmate. However, in manyjurisdictions, the specific diagnosis is not revealed. InNew York, for example, transportation officers aresimply advised to \"take normal precautions.\" Manycorrectional systems vaguedisclosures regarding \"infectious diseases\" or \"blood-borne diseases\". These may in fact preserve confiden-tiality, since such warnings may be issued with regardto inmates with diseases other than AIDS, but theymay also be codes which technically, preserve confiden-tiality while issuing specific notifications.When inmates are transferred, ,correctional systemsgenerally send their full medical file to the new institu-tion. This may include .ao diagnoses of AIDS or 1col fidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 97J.(Ju ARC, and, in some cases, information on HIVseropositivity as well.Notification of Other Criminal JusticeAgenciesAn important issue to resolve is how far the chain ofnotification should extend within the criminal justicesystem. For example, should parole authorities benotified of a potential parolee's medical status? It maybe questionable from a legal standpoint for the:, infor-mation to be available to parole decisionmakers.However, there is also the question of whether paroleofficers or community corrections staff should benotified of an inmate's medical status once parole hasbeen approved. Again, the test should be whether suchofficials have a clear need to know in order to makeprogramming decisions and placements and/or to pro-vet themselves or others from infection. A numberof correctional systems, including Missouri, Maine,and Iowa, routinely notify parole and community cor-rections authorities of releasees' HIV antibody status.Another question likely to arise is the follming: if anintake test reveals HIV seropositivity or an inmatedevelops AIDS or ARC, should the system notify thecity or county jail from which the inmate came todetermine if the inmate had sexu?' contact or sharedneedles with any inmates there? Other institutions andorganizations outside the correctional system do notgenerally provide such notifications.Notification to Public Health DepartmentsFifty-three percent of state/federal systems, 39 percentof responding city/county systems and 50 percent ofCanadian systems routinely notify public health agen-cies when an inmate is determined to in HIV-seropositive. Under Colorado law, state Lnd localpublic health departments must be notified of allpositive HIV antibody test results. This law was passedso that public health authorities could be alerted tothe presence of potentially infectious individuals andso that such individuals could be counseled regardingthe meaning of their test and measures necessary toprevent transmission of the virus. However, under theColorado law, public health departments must main-tain the test results in strictest confidence. The infor-mation is not available to insurers or employerswithout permission of the subject. Several other states,including Nevada and Louisiana, now have lawsrequiring notification of public health departments. 98 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESNotification of Spouses/Sexual PartnersSome correctional administrators believe that they mayhave a moral responsibility to notify the spouse orsexual partner of inmates with AIDS, ARC, or asymp-tomatic HIV infection prior to authorizing any con-jugal visits or furloughs and prior to the inmate'sdischarge. The question that arises here again iswhether correctional systems should bear more respon-sibility than do institutions in the community at large,which generally require no such notification. In otherwords, should correctional administrators rely oncounseling and education on AIDS, as is the generalprocedure in the outside world, or do the particularcharacteristics of correctional inmates necessitatefurther interventions?A number of concerns will affect these decisions, notthe least of which is the correctional system's desireto avoid legal liability should an inmate infect someoneelse while on furlough or conjugal visit. Some statesattempt to avoid the problem by excluding HIV-infected inmates from such programs. Others, such asConnecticut, make conjugal visits contingent on theinmate's notification of his or her spouse or sexualpartner.However, even with such policies, the larger issue ofwhat to do at parole or release must be answered. Tominimize the risk of liability, each agency should adopta written policy specifically requiring the physician (orother health-care provider) who may know of anindividual's positive HIV antibody status to counselsuch individuals -egarding their obligations to informall sexual partners of their medical condition. Accord-ing to recent CDC guidelines, in the eveAt an infectedindividual refuses to notify his or her sexual partners,the health-care professional should consider makingconfidential notification. The policy of the Michigancorrectional department .s in line with this CDCrecommendation.4 California recently passed a lawspecifically permitting physicians to notify the spousesof HIV-infected persons.Contact TracingWhen certain communicable diseases are diagnosed,attempts ne sometimes made to identify the sourcefrom whom an individual contracted the disease andanyone whom an individual might have exposed to thedisease prior to his or her diagnosis. Such \"contacttracing\" is sometimes attempted in AIDS cases. Forexample, the Alaska Department of Corrections inter-views all inmates found to be HIV-infected regardingpossible partners in sexual or needlesharing activitiesand undertakes notification of those contacts.510J While potentially useful in certain limited situations,such contact tracing may also produce serious prob-lems: the number of individuals involved in the inquiryexpands almost geometrically, and these individuals'privacy is invaded and their lives are disrupted out ofall proportion to the real risk that they transmitted oracquired the AIDS virus. Indeed, some physicians andepidemiologists believe that contact tracing is not likelyto work in AIDS cases because of the difficulty in pin-pointing the specific incident resulting in infection andbecause there is no treatment which might provide anincentive for persons to admit contact. Mandatorycontact tracing programs may also undermine effortsto develop voluntary cooperation with AIDS preven-tion efforts.6Danger of Disclosure to Other InmatesAs discussed in Chapter Four, it is extremely difficultto maintain the confidentiality of HIV antibody testresults in a correctional environment, particularlywhen a policy of mandatory mass screening is in place.Despite the system's best efforts to preserve confiden-tiality, it is almost inevitable that at least some otherinmates will learn the identity of those infected withHIV. Active AIDS or ARC will, of course, be morenoticeable than asymptomatic infection.Some inmates will themselves disclose their medicalstatus. Otherwise, many events may serve to \"tip off'other inmates. The inmate \"rumor mill\" is especiallyattuned to such information and it is likely to spreadvery rapidly. If, for example, inmates are moved toother cells or other parts of the institution withoutother explanations, this could serve to label them asinfected. Similarly, otherwise inexplicable exclusion ofan inmate in prison for a relatively minor offense fromwork release or other programs would create suspicion.This all serves to underline the importance of extremeand consistent care in guarding the confidentiality ofthis extremely sensitive information. Disclosure mayplace an inmate in a very difficult and dangerous situa-tion in the institution. There should be severe sanc-tions for unauthorized breaches of confidentiality.Legal and Labor Relations IssuesIn late 1985, when the first edition of this report wasprepared, most legal issues regarding AIDS in correc-tional facilities remained potential or theoretical; fewactual cases had been filed. Since then, however,numerous cases have been filed by inmates, and a fewhave reached disposition. Most cases have been filedin United States District Courts, although some havebeen filed in state and county courts as well. To date,few AIDS-related cases have been Instituted by cor-rectional staff. This reflects tne fact that there havebeen no cases of seroconversion, AIDS or ARC amongcorrectional staff attributable to contact with inmates.By 1987, almost 40 percent of federal/state systemshad been involved in AIDS-related litigation. Fewercity/county systems (9 percent) had been involved inlitigation.This section summarizes caselaw and legal and laborrelations issues under foJowing headings.Issues Raised by InmatesGeneral standards for correctionalmedical careChallenges to segregation andconditions of confinementQuality of care in AIDS casesChallenges to HIV antibody testingDuration of incarcerationIssues Raised by Inmates and Staff:Protection from HIV InfectionMandatory screening segregationConfidentiality of medical issuesObligation to perform dutiesEmployees infectionand AIDSIssues by InmatesGeneral Standards for CorrectionalMedical CareThere is substantial caselaw on correctional medicalcare in general which is important for administratorsto consider in developing policies regarding AIDS.Indeed, AIDS should not necessarily be considered aunique correctional health issue; legal standards andcorrectional policies regarding communicable diseasesin general may be applicable to AIDS and may havealready been tested in court. The major legal standardsand causes of action on correctional health care arediscussed below. 11uSuits on the quality of correctional medical care may Confidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 99 be brought on the basis of federal Constitutional stan-dards, state law, or common law. Plaintiffs may seekjudgments under 42 USC 1983, the provision whichessentially gives citizens the legal right to sue thegovernment.There are three basic federal Constitutional standardsand principles relevant to correctional medical care.First, under the Eighth Amendment, inmates areentitled to a safe, decent and humane environment,although the Fifth Circuit has held that this does notmean they are legally entitled to rehabilitative orrecreational programs while in prison.8 Second, inEstelle v. Gamble,9 Idle liberate indifference to seriousmedical need\" was held to violate the Eighth Amend-ment protection against \"cruel and unusual punish-ment.\" Finally, because of segregation issues, theFederal constitutional guarantee of \"equal protectionof the laws\" is relevant to correctional medical carecases, and particularly to cases involving inmates withAIDS.Medical care in correctional institutions is usuallygoverned by the same state laws (e.g., Medical Prac-tice and Nursing Practice Acts) that apply to care inthe community at large. However, inmates are notnecessarily entitled to all aspects of medical careavailable in the community at large for example, theright to choose one's own physician and the right toa second medical opinion. Finally, in some states,correctional medical care may be subject to suits forcommon law torts such as negligence. Medical mal-practice suits are also a possibility.Challenges to Segregation and Conditionsof ConfinementA number of cases have been brought by inmates withAIDS, ARC or asymptomatic HIV infection allegingthat the conditions of their confinement violate equalprotection standards and/or constitute cruel andunusual punishment. In the first such case, Corderov. Coughlin,'\u00b0 a group of segregated inmates withAIDS sued the New York State Department of Cor-rectional Services alleging cruel and unusual punish-ment and deliberate indifference to their seriousmedical needs. They claimed that their segregation un-constitutionally fostered depression and deteriorationin their medical condition. The inmates also arguedthat they had been deprived of equal protection of thelaws by being medically segregated. While the plain-tiffs conceded that there is no absolute right torehabilitation programs, exercise or visitation, theirsuit argued that inmates with AIDS must have thesame access to these as do other inmates in the system. 100 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESHowever, the plaintiffs alleged that, by reason of theirsegregation, they were unconstitutionally deprived ofsuch programs and benefits. Moreover, they claimedthat they were forced to live under conditions worsethan those in the disciplinary unit, without any find-ing of a disciplinary violation simply because theyhad AIDS.The court found for the Department of CorrectionalServices, holding that inmates have no constitutionalright to freedom from segregation instituted to ad-vance a reasonable correctional objective. Segregationis proper if it is necessary for the protection of inmateswith AIDS and other inmates in the institutio2. Thecourt also held that there was no Eighth Amendmentviolation because the plaintiffs had not shown thatthey were denied adequate food, clothing or shelter.Finally, the equal protection claims were deniedbecause the constitutional guarantee applies only to\"similarly situated\" groups or individuals, and the in-mates with AIDS and the other inmates in the institu-tion were not, in the view of the court, similarlysituated.An Oklahoma case, Powell v. Department of Correc-tions, raised some of the same issues as Cordero v.Coughlin. In this case, an HIV seropositive but asymp-tomatic inmate filed suit alleging denial of equal pro-tection in that he was isolated from the generalpopulation, constantly supervised, and denied accessto worship and exercise. The major difference betweenthis case and Cordero concerns the very differentmedical conditions of the plaintiffs. However, thecourt reached the same conclusion as in Cordero. Itdeclared thatthesegregation policy furtheredlegitimate correctional objectives, namely preventionof the spread of disease and protection of theseropositive inmate from other inmates. Further, thecourt stated that inmates have no constitutional rightto be in general population and that the inmate hadnot been denied equal protection since he had not beentreated differently from other seropositive inmatesinfact, no other seropositive inmates had been identifiedin the Oklahoma prison system.11In Farmer v. Levine, a seropositive inmate in theBaltimore County Detention Center was isolated in adisciplinary unit and denied access to rehabilitationprograms, the law library, and religious services. (Thelast two restrictions were removed after the suit wasinstituted.) The plaintiff also complained that guardsroutinely wore masks when entering his cell, left hismeals at the opposite end of the cell rather thanhanding them to him directly, and subjected him toother forms of abuse. Farmer alleged that all of this 111 ....rL.AMMING.11IM constituted punishment without due process (i.e. thathe was placed in the disciplinary unit without a hear-ing on any specific conduct), as well as denial of equalprotection, right to nrivacy, and freedom of expres-sion and association. The state, citing Cordero,responded that the isolation was not punitive butrather was in furtherance of a legitimate institutionalobjectiveprevention of the spread of disease. Amagistrate recommended that the county's segregationpolicy be upheld, but the case became moot when theplaintiff was transferred to federal prison.12In an Alabama case, an inmate alleged that his segrega-tion and disqualification from work release programsdue to his seropositivity were unconstitutional. As inthe other cases, the state responded that these restric-tions were justifiable on the basis of institutionalsecurity and health. The court, citing Cordero andPowell, ruled in favor of the Alabama correctionalsystem.13Finally, in a recent Maryland case, the court upheldthe medical segregation of an inmate with AIDS. Sinc,this case involved segregation ordered by medical stafirather than by correctional administrators, the courtstated that it need not rule on the validity of ad-ministratively segregating inmates infected with HIV.14In Colorado, by contrast, the Department of Correc-tions has eased its segregation policy for seropositiveinmates. In motions filed under Marioneaux v. Col-orado State Penitentiary, a broad correctional condi-tions case pending since the 1970s, seropositive inmatescomplained of being placed in a maximum securitysegregation unit next to death row, in violation of anobjective classification system previously agreed to bythe correctional department. The state pleaded \"specialcircumstances,\" but plaintiffs countered that theclassification scheme contained no provision forspecial circumstances. Ultimately, the correctionaldepartment decided to move those seropositive inmateswho ordinarily would have been classified as mediumsecurity or lower to a medium security unit.15A pending Massachusetts case refines the equal pro-tection arguments advanced in Cordero and Powell.This case, Johnson v. Fair, contests the permanenthospitalization of an AIDS patient, even when hissymptoms are in remission. The plaintiff bases hisequal protection argument on the current policy of thecorrectional system which allGws inmates with Alt.:,',but not inmates with AIDS (who are similarly situatedin that both groups are infected with HIV and capableof infecting others), to return to the general prisonpopulation. This argument did not prevail in the in-mate's request for a preliminary injunction, but willbe further considered in the main case. Finally, inMissouri, a gruup of segregated HIV - seropositive in-mates filed suit seeking access to an outside exerciseyard for one hour per day. A Federal magistraterecommended denial of their request for a preliminaryinjunction on the ground that the plaintiffs had noconstitutional right to \"touch the ground\" and thattheir access to sundecks in the fourth-floor segrega-tion unit met constitutional standards. Moreover, themagistrate agreed with the correctional system that theseropositive inmates might be at risk for physical harm.if they were permitted access to the exercise yard.15Several recent Nevada and New York cases involvecomplaints from HIV-infected inmates regarding theirrights to work programs and visitation. In Williamsv. Sumner, a seropositive Nevada inmate soughtreversal of his exclusion from a community work pro-gram. The court denied the claim on the ground thatprisoners have no independent constitutional right toemployment.17In Doe v. Coughlin an inmate with AIDS complainedof denial of conjugal visits. This case was decided infavor of the Department of Correctional Services, andthe decision was recently upheld by the state's Courtof Appeals. As with the segregation cases, the basisof the decision was that an inmate's \"rights arenecessarily limited by the realities of confinement andby the legitimate goals and policies of the correctionalsystem\". A dissenting opinion contended that thestate's action constituted an \"invidious discrimination\"against the plaintiff's decision-making [within] their marital privacy right\". Follow-ing initiation of another New York suit, a correctionalsystem policy was changed to permit HIV-infected in-mates to receive visits from their children.18In sum,-stile several cases remain pending, courtshave uphtthe discretion of correctional officials tosegregate HIV-infected inmates and deny them accessto certain programs and privileges where the policy isdeemed to be based on legitimate medical, safety, andinstitutional security considerations.Quality of Care in AIDS CasesTypically, these are cases brought by inmates withAIDS alleging inadequate medical care or \"deliberateindifference\" to serious medical need. In Thagard v.County of Cook,19 an inmate with ARC filed suit fordamages alleging inadequate medical care in that hewas repeatedly denied an \"AIDS examination\" whichhe had requested. The inmate had developed scynesymptoms of ARC but, as of the time of the suit, hadnot developed AIDS. The court found for the correc- Confidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 101 Fil.111.111=MM1.11161.1111rMEJIMMIIM.21.11C,M\\ tional department on the ground that the inmate hadshown no actual injury to have resulted from thefailure to provide the examination. Notably, the courtstated that while good medical practice probably wouldhave been to provide the requested examination, itcould not enforce good medical practice. An Alabamainmate's suit alleging that he was not provided evalua-tion and treatment for syplullis and AIDS as he hadrequested was dismissed by a federal judge. The courtagain held that it could not and would not substituteits opinion for that of the physician responsible forthe inmate's case. In a pending Florida case, an inmatealleges that he should have been diagnosed with ARCsooner and that, as a result of the late diagnosis, hismedical condition suffered.23Permanent hospitalization, which may seem at firstglance a convenient way to segregate inmates withAIDS from others, may in some cases be medicallyinappropriate. Because AIDS and ARC involve ex-treme susceptibility to infections (and because hospitalsare filled with infectious disease patients), hospitalsmay create special health risks for persons with AIDSand ARC. In a case currently pending inMassachusetts, an inmate with AIDS, whose symp-toms are in remission, is contesting his permanentassignment to a hospital, in part based on the in-creased risk to his health.21 A key question in e!cidingthis case and a key issue h. administrators who hopeto avoid similar suits will be whether or not thehospital assignment is medically indicated.A class action in Nevada challenging a broad rangeof correctional conditions includes a complaint of in-adequate attention to the medical needs of the state'sseropositive inmates.22 In a recently filed Idaho case,an HIV-seropositive inmate alleges that he was pro-vided inadequate medical care,23 and several HIV-seropositive inmates housed in a prison hospital inMississippi charged that the correctional departmentfailed to provide them adequate protection. One ofthese inmates was poisoned. This matter was resolvedwithout a lawsuit.24 Finally, a wrongful death suit maysoon be filed on behalf of a former Los AngelesCounty inmate who died of AIDS while in custody.25These cases raise a number of important issues,including timely diagnosis and undertreatment. Thesemay be particular risks if the correctional medical staffis unprepared to meet the often intense medical needsof AIDS and ARC patients, or if it is hampered byexaggerated fears of AIDS. In this regard, staff educa-tion is absolutely necessary. The legal risksnot tospeak of the human costs of inadequate care may bevery high. 102AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESChallenges to HIV Antibody TestingAs yet, there have been no inmate suits challengingmandatory mass screening for antibodies to HIV.However, there have been several challenges to otherapplications of antibody testing. In Connecticut aninmate sought to block blind epidemiological studiesof the prevalence of HIV in the correctional popula-tion,26 but the case was dropped by the plaintiff. AnOklahoma inmate alleges that he was tested againsthis will, and this case is still pending.27The question of mandatory testing following poten-tial transmission incidents will be discussed later in thischapter.Duration of IncarcerationThis is still primarily a policy issue, but it surely haslegal implications. Some correctional administratorsconsider early release for inmates with AIDS, whilesome judges and others advocate extended confine-ment of infected individuals.As the number of persons with AIDS within jails andprisons has increased and as increasingly ill personsfaced the prospect of spending their last days inprisonexecutive clemency and early release have beenconsidered. In New York state, a discretionary earlyrelease policy for AIDS patients, based onhumanitarian considerations, led to the parole of fiftyoffenders by March 1987. In other states, includingMassachusetts, similar policies are being considered.28There are several areas of concern surrounding earlyrelease of persons with AIDS. First, agencies certainlyhave a moral and probably, as well, a legalobligation to ensure that such releasees are not simply\"dumped\" onto the street. As discussed in ChapterFive, there must be careful and comprehensive plan-ning and followup to ensure that released individualsreceive all medical benefits and other support servicesto which they are entitled.Second, early release programs may raise concernamong the public about the future safety of spouses,sexual partners, and others with whom the releaseemay come into contact. Under New York policies,parole is discretionary, but is not specifically depen-dent upon parolees' agreeing to notify, or permitnotification of sexual partners or others potentially atrisk. Since state law prohibits disclosure without per-mission, family members may be unaware of riskfactors. The parole board encourages counseling ofreleasees to notify their sexual partners and favorsparole only of extremely ill inmates or those with\"strong predictions of good behavior.\"1 3 As yet, there have been no claims against parole boardsor correctional systems for negligent release leadingto infection of a member of the public, but thepossibility of such claims is important to consider. Toprotect against possible liability, early parole shouldbe granted only for humanitarian reasons, shouldinvolve careful planning and followup on aftercare,and should be contingent upon thorough counselingof the parolee regarding his or her responsibilities toavoid infecting others. In addition, as was discussedearlier, officials should take steps to notify the sexualpartners of infected persons who refuse to carry outsuch notification themselves.Several correctional systems and judges believe thatinmates with AIDS should be kept in the medical careof the system as long as possible (e.g., no parole, notransfer to minimum security institutions, no pre-release placement in halfway houses or community-based programs), to provide better care, to minimizethe risk of HIV transmission, and to reduce thesystem's potential legal liabilityThis policy option raises serious legal issues. Mentallyill persons may be legally committed or otherwisesegregated for extended periods if they are deemed topose a threat to society or to themselves. However,the situation of the inmate with AIDS is different: therisk that he or she will transmit the infection largelyinvolves consensual acts rather than forcible victimiza-tions. A possible exception may be the violent sexualoffender who is infected with HIV; the questionlogically arises whether such individuals' medical statusshould influence parole or release decisions. In general,such decisions should probably be based on a com-bination of medical and non-medical factors (e.g., theinmate's medical status and an assessment of thelikelihood that he or she would engage in violent orother non-consensual acts by which the infection mightbe transmitted). However, decisions that extend theperiod of :ncarceration can probably not be supportedon the basis of medical factors.Issues Raised by Both Inmates and Staff:Protect: -?! from HIV InfectionThere are a number of AIDS-related legal issues thatcan, and have, been raised by both inmate and cor-rectional staff. These are discussed below.Manda' Jry Screening and SegregationNumerous cases have now been filed by inmates alleg-ing that correctional systems have not provided themadequate protection from HIV infection while inprison. Most seek mandatory HIV antibody screen-ing and segregation of seropositives. The first case ofthis type was La Rocca v. Dalsheim, in which a groupof healthy New York state inmates sought injunctiverelief from the policies of the Downstate CorrectionalFacility which allegedly provided inadequate protec-tion against the spread of HIV infection. However,the court held that the segregation policies and precau-tions followed at the institution were adequate to pro-tect the inmates. Significantly, the court also aeclaredthat Tin view of the scientific uncertainty concern-ing...AIDS, and the reluctance of the court tointervene in the day-to-day management of a prison,no procedural regimen regarding the protection ofthe rights of AIDS-free inmates shall be judiciallymandated . \"2 9However, this case arose before the HIV antibody testsbecame available, and now many suits have been filedseeking antibody screening and other policies for thesystematic identification and separation of infectedinmates. Thus far, all disposed cases have been decidedin favor of the correctional systems' policies not toinstitute mass screening. However, many of these casesdemonstrate that misinformation about AIDS stillinfluencesattitudes and actionsincorrectionalinstitutions.A North Carolina case seeking mass screening of in-mates, as well as steps to halt homosexual activity inprison and an end to sharing of kitchen utensils, toiletfacilities, clothing and bed linen with infected inmates,was decided in favor of the correctional department.A number of Florida cases demanding an end tohomosexuals working in prison food service, and pro-tection against homosexuals spreading HIV infectionthrough assaultive and consensual sexual acts havebeen dismissed.30 A North Carolina case seeking massscreening was recently dismissed, as was a case fromFlorida. A similar case was dismissed by the U.S.District Court for Southern Indiana on the ground thatstate legislatures and correctional officials, not federalcourts, can best decide how inmates should be pro-tected from AIDS 31 In Oregon, \"mainstreaming\" ofHIV seropositive inmates was upheld and in Arizona,a case seeking removal of an inmate with AIDS froma correctional institution was dismissed.32Finally, a Pennsylvania case was similarly decided, butraised some potentially troubling legal precedents. Inthis case, an inmate alleged that his constitutionalrights had been violated by the correctional system'sfailure to segregate HIV-infected inmates. The courtdismissed the particular claim as frivolous, but tooknote of Lareau v. Manson, in which a correctionalsystem's failure to screen inmates for a communicabledisease constituted a violation of due process andConfidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 103i \"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\".33The applicability of Lareau depends upon whetherAIDS is categorized as a \"communicable disease\".Inmate cases seeking mandatory mass screening,segregation of seropositives and/or other similarmeasures are pending in Nevada, Oregon, Massa-chusetts, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Oklahoma, andArkansas.34 The Arkansas case also calls for dischargeor any staff who develop AIDS, removal of any sero-positive correctional staff from contact with other staffand inmates, and systematic reporting of all AIDScases to the correctional department and the statehealth department. A pending Florida case alleges thatthe correctional department was negligent in failing toprevent an inmate from adulterating coffee with theblood of an AIDS patient.36Two pending New Jersey cases allege failure to followestablished administrative and medical screeningpolicies and demand systematic identification andsegregation of high-risk inmates and those with symp-toms of HIV infection, as well as more and betterinmate training on AIDS. The plaintiffs also call forexpanded HIV antibody testing on a voluntary basis.36A Pennsylvania inmate seeks release from prison orelevation of the institution's conditions to a constitu-tional level. He alleges wanton neglect by being placedin population with inmates who have ARC or AIDS,thus endangering his life.37 Finally an Arizona suitseeks damages for \"severe emotional distress\" to aninmate as a result of his being housed in the same unitwith ARC inmates.38Confidentiality of Medical InformationAs discussed earlier, most jurisdictions have stronglaws and/or policies mandating confidentiality ofmedical information regarding HIV infection andAIDS. However, several cases have been filed byinmates alleging improper disclosure of such informa-tion, while correctional staff in at least two states havesought to obtain lists of all infected inmates.In a recently-dismissed New Jersey case, inmates al-leged that under current policies AIDS-related medicalrecords might be seen by correctional officers. Theyalso asked to be tested for HIV antibodies but to befreed from any disciplinary action for engaging inneedlesharing activities that might have led to their in-fection.39Several cases regarding AIDS-related information havebeen brought by inmates against the Federal Bureauof Prisons. In a recently dismissed case, a privateattorney sued under the Freedom of Information Act 104 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESfor information on the number of AIDS cases, cor-rectional management policies for inmates with AIDS,and training programs on AIDS.40 In two otherpending cases, inmates who had incidentally appearedin an AIDS training film allege that they have suffereddamages because other inmates now believe they haveAIDS.4' Two Florida cases allege improper disclosureof antibody test results by the correctional department,and claim mistreatment as a result of that disclosure.42On the other hand, correctional staff in Delaware andNevada have sought lists of all IV-infected inmates intheir respective systems. In Delaware, officers filed aunion grievance claiming violation of a contract pro-vision that they would be notified of the names of allinmates \"suspected of having any communicabledisease\". The dispute arose after some twenty inmates,claiming to have had homosexual relations withanother inmate who had died of AIDS, were volun-tarily tested with a guarantee of confidentiality. Anarbitrator determined that the correctional system mustabide by the terms of the contract and disclose thenames of the seropositives. The correctional systemthey_ filed suit challenging the arbitrator's decision, butthe court allowed the decision to stand.43In Nevada, where all inmates are screened for anti-bodies to HIV, correctional officers have made severalattempts to gain access to the names of seropositiveinmates. The state's attorney general issued an opinionthat disclosure must be limited to those who \"have alegitimate medical need to know in connection withthe prevention and control of AIDS\". This would notinclude all correctional officers. The officers' unioncountered that, because of the frequency of potentialtransmission incidents, all officers did have a legitimateneed to know. The union intends to seek an OSHAruling and new state legislation that mandate disclosureof the names of HIV-infected inmates to all correc-tional officers.44Correctional Systems' Liability for HIVInfectionsOne of the most serious legal concerns of correctionalsystems is that they will be held liable should an in-mate or staff member become infected with HIV whileincarcerated or on the job. In upholding the medicalsegregation of an inmate with AIDS, a federal districtcourt judge felt constrained to comment on the ad-visability of administrative segregation as well. Henoted that \"prison officials might face a \u00a71983 suit forfailing to isolate a known AIDS patient or carrier, ifthe carrier infects another inmate who could show thatsuch failure to isolate constituted grossly negligent orreckless conduct on the part of such officials\".45115 A few cases have now been filed by inmates seekingdamages for allegedly contracting HIV infection whilein a correctional facility. A possible basis of such suitsis failure to provide protection from sexual assault.Indeed, a recently-filed Florida case alleges infectionthrough a gang rape in an institution.46Inmate plaintiffs in suits alleging HIV infection incorrectional institutions face two serious problems: 1)the difficulty of linking transmission to a particularincident, which is very difficult from a medical stand-point in almost all AIDS cases except those associatedwith blood transfusions; and 2) the problem ofestablishing that the correctional system was \"grosslynegligent or reckless\" in permitting the incident tooccur. Correctional systems have been required bycourts to adhere to a standard of reasonable care inprotecting inmates. Breaches of this standard may con-stitute cruel and unusual punishment.'\" In severalcases, correctional systems and their officials have beenheld liable for damages resulting from homosexualrapes and other inmate-on-inmate assaults on theground that inadequate supervision had been providedto prevent such incidents.48However, correctional systems have not been heldresponsible for insuring the absolute safety of personsin their custody. In several cases, for example, courtshave held that a correctional system could be liablefor damages resulting from inmate-on-inmate assaultonly if its officials knew or should have known inadvance of the risk to the particular inmate.49Moreover, in one case, the court held that there is noliability in mere negligence. In other words, thenegligence must be of a gross or outrageous sort.50In the case of transmission by consensual acts, the cor-rectional system would appear to be on even strongerground, particularly if it could establish an \"assump-tion of risk\" defense by proving that the inmate hadbeen given education and training on the known meansby which the infection is transmitted.51To avoid any potential liability and to discharge itsresponsibility to provide a safe environment for in-mates, correctional systems should attempt to preventhigh-risk behavior among inmates, protect all inmatesfrom victimizationespecially those who are young,small, physically weak, or overtly homosexual anc,avoid any practices which could lead to unprotectedblood exposure. Clark County, Nevada, has beenserved with discovery requests preparatory to a possi-ble lawsuit by a former inmate of the county jail whoall,es that he was exposed to the AIDS virus througha jail policy requiring that inmates share razors.52 Thislawsuit will undoubtedly face serious proof problemsbecause of the difficulty, noted above, of linking in-fection to a specific incident, particularly an incidentof a type never implicated in transmission of the virus.However, this is an example of how an ill-advisedpolicy such as requiring inmates to share razors canlead to legal complications.Although no cases of this kind have yet been filed,correctional systems may also be concerned about legalliability should an employee be infected on the job.Departments are not legally required to insure theabsolute safety of their employees, but only to adhereto a reasonable standard of care. Just as an agencywould only be held liable for a gunshot wound or otherinjury incurred in the line of duty if established safetyprocedures had been violated or the department hadbeen otherwise negligent, so in the case of HIV infec-tion, such negligence would also need to be shown.(Of course, worker's compensation might well applyto either case, but would not entail the serious conse-quences of a finding of departmental liability.) Themost obvious form of negligence would be failure toprovide adequate training on precautionary measuresagainst HIV infection. This would be a particularproblem if the officer's infection could be shown tohave resulted, even in part, from a failure to followprecautions.Thus, it is important not only that training be givenand safety procedures be followed, but that both train-ing in and compliance with those procedures bedocumented. This documentation could be importantevidence in future lawsuits.Testing in Response to PotentialTransmission IncidentsThere continues to be controversy over whether a cor-rectional system or individual staff member maycompel an inmate to be tested for antibodies to HIV(and be told the results of this test) following a poten-tial transmission incident. (Although the issue has notyet been raised, presumably this discussion also ap-plies to the reverse situation in which an inmatewould seek the compulsory testing of an officer.) Herethe issues of forced testing and disclosure of resultsare inextricable. It would hardly be worth havingsomeone tested if the results were not to be disclosedto the interested parties. As discussed earlier, forcedtesting and/or disclosure are currently prohibited bylaw in many jurisdictions. However, at least some ofthese laws are likely to be modified in the near futureto permit forced testing of persons involved in aggres-sive or reckless acts. In the meantime, many judgesapparently believe that they have the right to issue .1 i (.3Confidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 105 court orders for such testing and disclosure. Indeed,since July 1987, two court orders have been issued inHouston requiring testing of inmates charged with sexcrimes. Florida has a procedure for obtaining searchwarrants to compel \"examination\" of persons with sex-ually transmitted diseases, explicitly including AIDS.53Georgia correctional policy on testing in response topotential transmission incidents includes applicationfor court orders should an inmate refuse testing. (Thefull policy is in Appendix G.)On the other hand, at least two cases of this sort havealso been decided against correctional officers or lawenforcement officers. In a Massachusetts case, a trialjudge ruled that an inmate who had allegedly scratchedand spit on a guard could not be involuntarily testedto learn if he was infected with HIV.54 The ruling wasbased on a state law prohibiting involuntary HIV anti-body testing and disclosure of t,st results, and tooknote of the strong medical evidence against transmis-sion of HIV through saliva. Similarly, a Californiacourt invalidated a search warrant authorizing HIVantibody testing of a defendant who was charged withbiting a police officer while resisting arrest. The courtbaseditsdecision on the state law prohibitingdisclosure of test results without the informed consentof the subject.55Issues Raised by StaffLabor Relations IssuesBoth through their unions and otherwise, correctionalstaff have raised concerns about the possibility of beinginfected with HIV on the job. Indeed, more than 30percent of federal/state systems and almost 20 percentof city/county systems report concerted actions byemployees regarding AIDS issues. As a result of theirconcerns, correctional employees, particularly thoseworking in special AIDS units, have demanded \"hazar-dous duty\" pay and/or reduced working hours.Obligation to Perform DutiesDespite the low risk of HIV infection associated withcorrectional duties, a number of agencies have facedpotential work disruptions as staff members haverefused to conduct searches, to transport prisoners, orto handle evidence out of fear of AIDS. About 20 per-cent of state/federal correctional systems and 15 per-cent of city/county systems have experienced suchrefusals by correctional officers. Since correctionalstaff have long assumed a wide variety of much greaterriskssuch as assaults, gunshot wounds, and so on itis clear that administrators must offer leadership inplacing the AIDS issue in its proper perspective. In106 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESgeneral, agencies have taken the position that fear ofAIDS does not excuse employees from performingtheir duties. The San Francisco Sheres Departmentsought a legal opinion from the city atterney's officeas to whether deputies were required to render CPRto jail inmates known or suspected of being infectedwith HIV. The opinion was clear: deputies have anaffirmative duty to provide CPR whenever necessary;failure to perform this duty could make the city liablefor any resulting injury and subject the employee todisciplinary action.56 Of course, jurisdictions shouldprovide one-way CPR masks and training on their use,as is done in San Francisco.Pregnant females represent the only category ofemployees who may be excused from duties due toAIDS-related concerns. In California, no pregnantwomen may be assigned to duty involving close super-vision or care of persons with AIDS. This is becauseof the woman's risk of being exposed to cytomegalo-virus (CMV), which is commonly excreted by personswith AIDS and which may cause birth defects. In ad-dition, there is the general concern that a pregnantwoman who contracted HIV infection from an inmatethrough a job-related exposure to blood or body fluidsmight perinatally transmit the infection to her child.While appropriate training can do much to allay con-cern, departments may still face work refusals due tothe highly emotional nature of AIDS-related fears. Inmost cases, departments have responded to unwar-ranted work refusals with swift and severe disciplinaryaction. In Kansas, a correctional officer was fired forrefusing to work unless he was told which inmates wereHIV seropositive, while two Vermont officers weredisciplined for refusing to strip search a seropositiveinmate and a Wayne County (Detroit) correctionalofficer was disciplined for refusing to work in closeproximity to seropositive inmates. To minimize theirsusceptibility to legal challenge, disciplinary guidelinesshould be clearly specified in writing, should beexplicitly based on accurate information about riskfactors, and should be consistent with standard agencypractice.Moreover, clear and accurate training on AIDS mustbe provided. A Minnesota case illustrates the problemsthat can result from inadequate training. In this case,a corrections officer who was fired for refusing tosearch inmates was reinstated by an arbitrator, whonoted that staff members had been given misleadinginformation regarding AIDS; specifically, a memoran-dum including the advice that \"no one really knowsthe way AIDS is transmitted, so be careful ..\"57 Themessage for correctional administrators is clear: alltraining materials on AIDS must be precise and-117 accurate, and all employees must 1.2 advised that, givenproper training, they will be subject to disciplinaryactionthey refuse to perform their duties out of afear of AIDS.Employees with HIV Infection and AIDSThere have already been non-job-related cases of AIDSamong staff members of correctional agencies. Thisraises the whole range of AIDS-related legal issues nowbeing faced by many types of employers. Primaryamong these are the rights of persons with HIV infec-tion and AIDS under the federal VocationalRehabilitation Act and state handicap statutes and theeffect of AIDS on relationships among employees inthe workplace. Correctional administrators shouldaddress the second issue just as they address staffmembers' resistance to working with HIV-infectedinmates; that is, fear of AIDS is no excuse for failureto perform duties.The first issue is more complex. As yet, there have beenno AIDS-related employee cases in correctionalsystems brought under federal rehabilitation laws orother handicap laws. The only legal matter which hasarisen thus far regarding a correctional officer withAIDS involved an officer in the Federal Bureau ofPrisons. After he informed his supervisor of the AIDSdiagnosis, the officer was transferred to another posi-tion outside the institution. The officer filed an equalemployment opportunity complaint seeking a returnto his original position. However, a settlement wasreached under which the individual's employment withthe Federal Bureau of Prisons was terminated, butthe FBOP agreed to continue paying for his healthinsurance .58Correctionai administrators should he familiar withthe Vocational Rehabilitation Act 'of 1973,6:) whichprohibits federal contractors and agencies receivingfederal financial assistance from discriminating againsthandicapped persons in any employment context. TheSupreme Court held, in School Board of NassauCounty, Fla. v. Arline, that an infectious disease(tuberculosis) was covered by the Act. This holdingwas recently applied in the case of a California teacherwith AIDS.60In the Arline case, the court held that an employer maynot arbitrarily fire, demote or segregate an employeewho does not (as an HIV-infected officer would not)pose an immediate health risk to others while on thejob. In addition, the employee must be reasonablyaccommodated, through reassignment if necessary, ifhe or she is unable to per form certain job duties dueto illness. This decision seems to prohibit all adversejob actions against AIDS-infected employees based ontheir medical condition except those arising fromphysical inability to perform assigned duties.Confidentiality and privacy concerns are just asimportant in developing policies for employees as foroffenders. It is unlikely, for example, that policiesmandating HIV antibody testing as a condition ofemployment in correctional systems will be upheld.Because of the extremely long incubation period andthe uncertainty as to whether an infected person willever become ill, antibody test results do not have alegitimate bearing on whether an applicant can do thejob -the only valid criterion in making hiring deci-sions. Moreover, the possibility that an infected personwould transmit the virus to someone else in the courseof his or her duties is so remote as to remove it fromlegitimate consideration in employment decisions. Onthese grounds, the policy of a Maryland police depart-ment to screen all potential recruits for antibodies toHIV was halted by the county utecutive.61Legislative DevelopmentsDuring 1987, many legislative proposals regardingAIDS in correctional facilities were introauced. By farthe most common legislative proposal was mandatoryHIV antibody screening and segregation of allseropositives. More than thirty state legislatures con-sidered such bills during 1987 and, although severalcame close to being adopted, none actually becamelaw. A mandatory screening law was passed in Illinois,but vetoed by the governor. Several more limited lawsregarding HIV antibody testing incorrectionalfacilities were passed. A new Delaware law authorizescorrectional health care personnel to order inmates tobe tested for diagnostic purposes. A Neitada law re-quires testing of all prison releasees. Finally, a newly-passed Oregon law requires testing of persons con-victed of sex crimes and drug-related offenses.62 Anumber of correctional administrators believe thatmandatory mass screening legislation rill probablypass in some states in 1988.Another area of legislative activity which is of greatinterest to corrections personnel is ramification of ex-isting laws and/or enactment of new laws to permitmandatory testing and disclosure of test results for in-dividuals involved in violent, aggressive, or recklessacts which might transmit HIV to others. A packageof laws was passed in Iowa in 1987 which would per-mit forced testing of inmates and disclosure of resultsin such situations, authorize correctional staff to beinformed of the presence of any inmates who have con-tagious diseases, and permit segregation of HIV-seropositive inmates.63Confidentiality, Legal and Labor Issues 107 ConclusionThis chapter has discussed the difficult issues sur-rounding confidentiality and disclosure of AIDS-related medical information in the correctional setting,as well as the key legal and legislative developmentsregarding AIDS in corrections. Among the findingsare the following:Realistically, it is difficult to maintain theconfidentiality of sensitive AIDS-relatedinformation in prisons and jails; however,because of the potentially serious conse-quences of unauthorized disclosure, it isessential that correctional authorities makethe strongest possible efforts to preserveconfidentiality. In many jurisdictions, con-fidentiality of AIDS-related information isspecifically required by law.No disclosures should be made exceptwhere clearly required by medical, safety,or institutional security considerations.Policies should be adopted and enforcedwhich specify clearly who is- fitted toreceive information, what in .nation isto be disclosed, and under what circum-stances. Vague policies permitting dis-closure to those with a \"need to know\" areinsufficient.In conformance with recent CDC guide-lines, correctional medical staff shouldstrongly counsel persons infected with HIVto inform their sex partners; if an in-dividual refuses to notify his or her part-ners, then correctional medical staff shouldcarry out the notification in a confidentialmanner.Since 19E5, there has been a great increasein litigation related to AIDS in correctionalfacilities. This has focused on the follow-ing areas, among others:challenges to segregation and conditionsof confinement;quality of medical care;attempts to mandate mass screening ofinmates for antibodies to HIV andsegregation of seropositives;`confidentiality and disclosure of medicalinformation.Most disposed cases on these issues havebeen decided in favor of correctionalsystems, on the grounds that their policies 108 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESwere in furtherance of legitimate medical,correctional management, or institutionalsecurity objectives. However, many casesremain pending.The legality of mandatory testing inresponse to potential transmission incidentsremains unclear; it is clearly prohibited inmany jurisdictions under current law, butmany judges believe that they can issue-%court orders to require such testing incertain instances.Many correctional systems are worriedabout their potential liability for HIV in-fections which occur among inmates whileincarcerated and among staff while on thejob. There are serious difficulties in link-ing infection with a particular episode;however, correctional systems can prob-ably eliminate any potential liability, andmaximize safety in their institutions, bytaking all reasonable steps to prevent in-mates from being victimized and providingall inmates and staff with clear and com-plete braining on how to avoid becominginfected with HIV.,The most important AIDS-related laborrelationsissueis whether correctionalemployees should or may be excused fromtheir duties out of fear of AIDS. Correc-tional and other law enforcement agencieshave been clear on this issue: such refusalsareunjustified andwillresultindisciplinary action.As yet, there have been no AIDS-relatedemployment cases brought by correctionalstaff under federal rehabilitation laws.However, correctional agencies shouldkeep abreast of the caselaw which stronglysuggests that action against employees WithAIDS or asymptomatic HIV infection onthe basis of their medical condition is im-permissible, unless directly tied to theirability to perform the job.There has been a great deal of legislativeactivity regarding AIDS in corrections dur-ing the last year. Most legislative proposalshave called for mandatory HIV antibodyscreening of inmates and segregation ofseropositives. While several more limitedtesting bills have passed, none of the man-datory mass screening proposals hasbecome law. 11.D .MIIIIMININIMilll Notes 1.Illinois Department of Corrections-Medical Services, \"AIDSManual,\" Section II-A.2.

DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICESPUBLIC HEALTH SERVICECENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROLfrom MMWR SUPPLEMENT, August 14, 1987, Vol. 36, No. 1S. pp. 3S-15SVol. 36 / No. IS MMWR 3SRevision of the CDC SurveillanceCase Definition forAcquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Reported byCouncil of State and Territorial Epidemiologists;AIDS Program, Center for Infectious Diseases, CDC INTRODUCTIONThe following revised case definition for surveillance of acquired immunodefi-ciency syndrome (AIDS) was developed by CDC in collaboration with public healthand clinical specialists. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)has officially recommended adoption of the revised definition for national reportingof AIDS. The objectives of the revision are a) to track more effectively the severedisabling morbidity associated with infection with human immunodeficiency virus(HIV) (including HIV-1 and HIV-2); b) to simplify reporting of AIDS cases; c) to increasethe sensitivity and specificity of the definition through greater diagnostic applicationof laboratory evidence for HIV infection; and d) to be consistent with currentdiagnostic practice, which in some cases includes presumptive 1., without confirm-atory laboratory evidence, diagnosis of AIDS-indicative diseases (e.g., Pneumocystiscarinii pneumonia, Kaposi's sarcoma).The definition is organized into three sections that depend on the status oflaboratory evidence of HIV infection (e.g., HIV antibody) (Figure 1). The majorproposed changes apply to patients with laboratory evidence for HIV infection: a)inclusion of HIV encephalopathy, HIV wasting syndrome, and a broader range ofspecific AIDS-indicative diseases (Section II.A); b) inclusion of AIDS patients whoseindicator diseases are diagnosed presumptively (Section 113); and c) elimination ofexclusions due to other causes of immunodeficiency (Section LA).Application of the definition for children differs from that for adults in two ways.First, multiple or recurrent serious bacterial infections and lymphoid interstitialpneumonia/pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia are accepted as indicative of AIDSamong children but not among adults. Second, for children<15 months of age whosemothers are thought to have had HIV infection during the child's perinatal period, thelaboratory criteria for HIV infection are more stringent, since the presence of HIVantibody in the child is, by itself, insufficient evidence for HIV infection because of thepersistence of passively acquired maternal antibodies < 15 months after birth.The new definition is effective immediately. State and local health departments arerequested to apply the new definition henceforth to patients reported to them. Theinitiation of the actual reporting of cases that meet the new definition is targeted forSeptember 1, 1987, when modified computer software and report forms should be inplace to accommodate the changes. CSTE has recommended retrospective applica-tion of the revised definition to patients already reported to health departments. Thenew definition follows: Appendix B121 4S MMWR August 14, 1987 1987 REVISION OF CASE DEFINITION FOR AIDSFOR SURVEILLANCE PURPOSESFor national reporting, a case of AIDS is defined as an illness characterized by oneor more of the following \"indicator\" diseases, depending on the status of laboratoryevidence of HIV infection, as shown below.I. Without Laboratory Evidence Regarding HIV InfectionIf laboratory tests for HIV were not performed or gave inconclusive results (SeeAppendix I) and the patient had no other cause of immunodeficiency listed in SectionI.A below, then any disease listed in Section I.B indicates AIDS if it was diagnosed bya definitive method (See Appendix II).A.Causes of immunodeficiency that disqualify diseases as indicators of AIDS inthe absence of laboratory evidence for HIV infection1.high-dose or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy or other ..nmuno-suppressive/cytotoxic therapy -5.3 months before the onset of the indicatordisease2.any of the following diseases diagnosed -5.3 months after diagnosis of theindicator tissue, or angioimmu-noblastic lymphadenopathy3.a genetic (congenital) immunodeficiency syndrome or an acquired immu-nodeficiency syndrome atypical of HIV infection, such as one involvinghypogammaglobulinemiaB.Indicator diseases diagnosed definitively (See Appendix II)1.candidiasis of the diarrhea persisting >1 month4.cytomegalovirus disease of an organ other than liver, spleen, or lymphnodes in a patient >1 month of age5.herpes simplex virus infection causing a mucocutaneous that 1 month; or or esophagitis duration affecting a patient >1 month of age6.Kaposi's sarcoma affecting a patient < 60 years of age7.lymphoma of the brain (primary) affecting a patient < 60 years of age8.lymphoid interstitial pneumonia and/or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia(LIP/PLH complex) affecting a child <13 years of age9.Mycobacterium avium complex or M. kansasii disease, disseminated (ata site other than or in addition to lungs, skin, or cervical or hilar lymphnodes)10.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia11.progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy12.toxoplasmosis of the brain affecting a patient >1 month of ageII. With Laboratory Evidence for HIV InfectionRegardless of the presence of other causes of immunodeficiency (LA), in thepresence of laboratory evidence for HIV infection (See Appendix I), any disease listedabove (I.B) or below (II.A or II.B) indicates a diagnosis of AIDS. 122 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES 13 Vol. 36 / No. 1S MMWR 5S A. Indicator diseases diagnosed definitively (See Appendix II)1.bacterial infections, multiple or recurrent (any combination of at least twowithin a 2-year period), of the following types affecting a child < 13 years ofage:septicemia, pneumonia, meningitis, bone or joint infection, or abscess ofan internal organ or body cavity (excluding otitis media or superficialskin or mucosal abscesses), caused by Haemophilus, Streptococcus(including pneumococcus), or other pyogenic bacteria2.coccidioidomycosis, disseminated (at a site other than or in addition tolungs or cervical or hilar II for description)4.histoplasmosis, disseminated (at a site other than or in addition to lungs orcervical or hilar lymph nodes)5.isosporiasis with diarrhea persisting >1 month6.Kaposi's sarcoma at any age7.lymphoma of the brain (primary) age8.other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of B-cell or non-Burkitt type) (SeeAppendix IV for equivalent terms and numeric codes used in theInternational Classificationof Diseases,NinthRevision,ClinicalModification)b.immunoblastic sarcoma (equivalent to any of Appendix IV for equivalentterms and numeric codes used in the International Classification ofDiseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification)Note: Lymphomas are not included here if they are of T-cell immuno-logic phenotype or their histologic type is not as\"Iymphocytic,\" \"Iymphoblastic,\" cleaved,\" or \"plasmacytoid mycobacteria other than M. tuber-culosis, disseminated (at a site other than or in addition to lungs, skin, orcervical or hilar lymph nodes)10.disease caused by M. tuberculosis, extrapulmonary (involving at least onesite outside the lungs, regardless of whether there is concurrent pulmo-nary involvement)11.Salmonella (nontyphoid) septicemia, II fordescription)B.Indicator diseases diagnosed presumptively (by a method other than those inAppendix II)Note:Given the seriousness of diseases indicative of AIDS, it is generallyimportant to diagnose them definitively, especially when therapy that wouldbe used may have serious side effects or when definitive diagnosis is needed Appendix B123 6S MMWR August 14, 1987 for eligibility for antiretroviral therapy. Nonetheless, in some situations, apatient's condition will not permit the performance of definitive tests. In othersituations, accepted clinical practice may be to diagnose presumptively basedon the presence of characteristic clinical and laboratory abnormalities. Guide-lines for presumptive diagnoses are suggested in Appendix III.1.candidiasis esophagus2.cytomegalovirus retinitis with interstitial pneumonia and/or pulmonary lymphoid hyperplasia(LIP/PLH complex) child <13 years of age5.mycobacterial disease (acid-fast bacilli with species not identified byculture), disseminated (involving at least one site other than or in additionto lungs, skin, or cervical or hilar lymph nodes)6.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia7.toxoplasmosis of the brain affecting a patient >1 month of ageIII. With Laboratory Evidence Against HIV InfectionWith laboratory test results negative for HIV infection (See Appendix I), adiagnosis of AIDS for surveillance purposes is ruled out unless:A.all the other causes of immunodeficiency listed above in Section I.A areexcluded; ANDB.the patient has had either:1.Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia diagnosed by a definitive method (SeeAppendix II); OR2.a.any of the other diseases indicative of AIDS listed above in Section I.Bdiagnosed by a definitive method lymphocyte count <400/mm3. COMMENTARYThe severe disease associated with HIV infection remains anessential, though not the only, indicator of the course of the HIV epidemic. Thenumber of AIDS cases and the relative distribution of cases by demographic,geographic, and behavioral risk variables are the oldest indices of the epidemic,which began in 1981 and for which data are available retrospectively back to 1978.The original surveillance case definition, based on then-available knowledge, pro-vided useful epidemiologic data on severe HIV disease ( 1). To ensure a reasonablepredictive value for underlying immunodeficiency caused by what was then anunknown agent, the indicators of AIDS in the old case definition were restricted toparticular opportunistic diseases diagnosed by reliable methods in patients withoutspecific known causes of immunodeficiency. After HIV was discovered to be the causeof AIDS, however, and highly sensitive and specific HIV-antibody tests becameavailable, the spectrum of manifestations of HIV infection became better defined, andclassification systems for HIV infection were developed (2-5). It became apparent thatsome progressive, seriously disabling, and even fatal conditions (e.g., encephalop-athy, wasting syndrome) affecting a substantial number of HIV- infected patients werenot subject to epidemiologic surveillance, as they were not included in the AIDS s_24 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES1r)4,c''') Vol. 36 / No. 1S MMWR 7S case definition. For reporting purposes, the revision adds to the definition most ofthose severe non-infectious, non-cancerous HIVassociated conditions that are cate-gorized in the CDC clinical classification systems for HIV infection among adults andchildren (4,5 ).Another limitation of the old definition was that AIDS-indicative diseases arediagnosed presumptively (i.e., without confirrpation by methods required by the olddefinition) in 10%-15% of patients diagnosed with such diseases; thus, an appreciableproportion of AIDS cases were missed for reporting purposes (6,7 ). This proportionmay be increasing, which would compromise the old case definition's usefulness asa tool for monitoring trends. The revised case definition permits the reporting of theseclinically diagnosed cases as long as there is laboratory evidence of HIV infection.The effectiveness of the revision will depend on how extensively HIV-antibodytests are used. Approximately one third of AIDS patients in the United States havebeen from New York City and San Francisco, where, since 1985, < 7% have beenreported with HIVantibody Zest results, compared with > 60% in other areas. Theimpact of the revision on the reported numbers of AIDS cases will also depend on theproportion of AIDS patients in whom indicator diseases are diagnosed presumptivelyrather than definitively. The use of presumptive diagnostic criteria varies geograph-ically, being more common in certain rural areas and in urban areas with manyindigent AIDS patients.To avoid confusion about what should be reported to health departments, the term\"AIDS\" should refer only to conditions meeting the surveillance definition. Thisdefinition is intended only to provide consistent statistical data for public healthpurposes. Clinicians will not rely on this definition alone to diagnose serious diseasecaused by HIV infection in individual patients because there may be additionalinformation that would lead to a more accurate diagnosis. For example, patients whoare not reportable under the definition because they have either a negative HIV-antibody test or, in the presence of HIV antibody, an opportunistic disease not listedin the definition as an indicator of AIDS nonetheless may be diagnosed as havingserious HIV disease on consideration of other clinical or laboratory characteristics ofHIV infection or a history of exposure to HIV.Conversely, the AIDS surveillance definition may rarely misclassify other patientsas having serious HIV disease if they have no HIV-antibody test but have anAIDSindicative disease with a background incidence unrelated to HIV infection, suchas cryptococcal meningitis.The diagnostic criteria accepted by the AIDS surveillance case definition shouldnot be interpreted as the standard of good medical practice. Presumptive diagnosesare accepted in the definition because not to count them would be to ignoresubstantial morbidity resulting from HIV infection. Likewise, the definition accepts areactive screening test for HIV antibody without confirmation by a supplemental testbecause a repeatedly reactive screening test result, in combination with an indicatordisease, is highly indicative of true HIV disease. For national surveillance purposes,the tiny proportion of possibly false-positive screening tests in persons with AIDS-indicative diseases is of little consequence. For the individual patient, however, acorrect diagnosis is critically important. The use of supplemental tests is, therefore,strongly endorsed. An increase in the diagnostic use of HIV-antibody tests couldimprove both the quality of medical care and the function of the new case definition,as well as assist in providing counselling to prevent transmission of HIV. 153Appendix B125 8S MMWR August 14, 1987 FIGURE I.

AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES171 ACQUIRED IU}IUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS)Questions And Answers--Correctional/Law Enforcement Issues 1.As a correctional officer, what do I do if blood, semen, spit, feces,vomit, or urine is thrown in my face, c, my body, or on my clothing? Viruses do not penetrate intact skin. Wash your body with soap andwater as soon as possible. If your uniform is visibly soiled with bloodor other body fluid, change your uniform, place the soiled uniform ina plastic bag and have it laundered separately using hot water anddetergent.If you have significant exposure (splashing of body fluidin tha eye, mouth or open skin lesion) consult with your medical staffregarding potential follow up recommendations. 2.Is there a danger that I can take the AIDS virus home to m familonmy body or on my uniform? There is no danger to your family if you wash your hands and changeyour clothing after exposure to contaminated blood or body fluids. 3.We deal with many violent and disruptive prisoners. What do we do ifwe get scratched or bitten by an AIDS-infected inmate? Avoid being bitten. If it happens, wash the wound thoroughly with soapand water as soon as possible; report the incident to your supervisor andseek medical care for treatment of the bite wound. There are no casesof AIDS reportedly transmitted through bites and scratches. 4.Do ve need special equipment to do CPR? No transmission of the AIDS virus (or even of the more easilytransmitted Hepatitis B virus) during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (CPR)has ever been documented. If you have access to a plastic shield formouth-to-mco 'A resuscitation, it is recommended that you use it; butnot having a device at hand definitely should not prevent you fromgiYing CPI.The chance that you can help someone outweighs any chanceof c atracting the virus. 5.Is there a danger LI picking up mattresses, clothing, bedding, andfood trays of AIDS-infected inmates? Food trays carry no risk. Clothes and linens visibly contaminated withbody fluids should be placed in a plastic hag and laundered separately.Persons handling contaminated clothing or linens should wear gloves,especially if they have open wounds on the hands. I 7 7 Appendix D 167 6,We often find hypodermic needles during cell searches. What if weaccidentally get stuck with .1 contaminated needle? Report any needle sticks to your supervisor and consult with yourmedical staff regarding potential follow up recommendations. YourChances of becoming infected with the AIDS virus from a contaminatedneedle stick is extremely small. Only one of 1,000 health care workerswho have experienced wounds from contaminated instruments has becomeinfected with HIV after a needle stick injury. Contaminated blood wasaccidentally injected deep into this worker's muscle with a largebore needle. 7.What precautions should responding/arresting officers take in approachinghigh-risk group members or known AIDS-infected persons? No special precautions are necessary when approaching high-risk groupmembers not known to be infected with a transmissible disease. Whenarresting someone known to be infected, gloves should be worn if thereis a high likelihood of contact with blood and body fluids, particularlyif the arresting officer has open skin wounds on the hands. 8.During intake procedures, (screening, body searches, fingerprinting, andphotographing), what precautions should the officer take in cases ofarrestees suspected or diagnosed with AIDS? No special precautions are needed for screening, fingerprinting andphotographing. Body searches that may result in contact with blood orother body fluids should be conducted with gloved hands, particularlyif the officer has broken skin on the hands. 9.What precautions should the officer in the correctional facility takeduring cell searches of persons diagnosed with AIDS? No special precautions art' indicated for cell searches except for thegeneral awareness of the possible presence of concealed sharp objects.Gloves should be worn when conducting body searches, particularly if anofficer has broken skin on the hands. 10.What precautions should the correctional officer take in transportingthe AIDS-infected arrestee or inmate to jail following arrest or tocourt for ensuing proceedings? No special transport precautions are necessary for an AIDS-infectedinmate or arrestee unless the person is also infected with a communicabledisease such as Tuberculosis which can be airborne. Consult medicalauthorities for any special precautions that may be appropriate for aspecific inmate based on his/her medical status. 168 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Inmate Training Materials i7. Georgia Department of CorrectionsAIDS Lesson Plan for Inmates Instructor Notes INTRODUCTION Good ,my name is and I am theAIDS Education Instructor for our institution.As you are aware, the subject which we will beaddressing is AIDS. For the next two hours wewill be talking about AIDS, and if you have anyquestions, or concerns which have not beenaddressed, I'll be answer them at the end.To begin with, what does AIDS mean?The term AIDS stands for ACQUIRED IMMUNEDEFICIENCY SYNDROME:Acquiredmeans t' at a person was not bornwith the illness, but became illfrom exposure to the virus. ImmuneDeficiencymeans that this illness attacks thebody's natural disease defensesystem, lea. ing it unable to fightoff infection. Syndromemeans that people who are ill withAIDS may display/show any number ofa group of symptoms; the disease isnot exactly the same in each person. Newspapers and television report new AIDSdevelopments daily. However, two aspects ofthis disease have not changed since it was firstreported in 1981:AIDS virus is still not spread by casualcontact; andthere is no cure or vaccine for this viruspeople who get AIDS die from it. HISTORY OF AIDSAIDS was first discovered in the United States Appendix D 171 Instructor Notes in 1981.Scientists from the Centers forDisease Control discovered two initial riskgroups: Gay and bisexual men with multiple sexualpartners; andIV drug users who have shared needles andsyringes, \"works\".Further study led them to add additional riskgroups: Female sexual partners of men at riskfor or infected with AIDS;Blood or plasma transfusion recipients from1978 - April 1985; and Infants born to parents at risk for AIDS.Blood or sexual contact was the link amonginfected people. In 1983, scientists found the cause of AIDS, avirus called HIV. HIV stands HumanImmunodeficiency Virus. It is also calledHTLV-III or LAV. But we will refer to it as theAIDS virus.The current number of cases is over 35,000 withstates like New York, New Jersey, California,Texas, and Florida reporting the highestincidences of AIDS. As this slide indicates, no sow slidestate is unaffected by the disease and Georgia #1.currently ranks eighth. The next slide traces the number of AIDS casessince 1981.The numbers at the top are new Show slidecases reported each year; the numbers at the #5.bottom reflect the cumulative, running totals,of cases.About 60% of all cases have died. HOW THE VIRUS WORKS IN THE BODY If the virus is able to enter the body and findits way into the bloodstream, it can havedevastating effects. The virus attacks and 172 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES 10 Instructor Notes destroys the blood cells which fight off diseaseand infection. This causes the body to becomeweak and susceptible to serious life-threateninginfections.It can take anywhere from 6 months to 9 years ormore after one is infected with the virus toshow symptoms. This is called the \"incubation\"period.However even though no symptoms arepresent, the person can transmit, give, thevirus through their blood, semen or vaginalsecretion.They are contagious, able totransmit it, throughout their life TRANSMISSION: How the virus is transmittedBlood, semen (cum), vaginal secretions andbreast milk of an infected person have beenfound to be the only transmitters of the AIDSvirus.AIDS is transmitted through intimate sexualcontact with an infected person, through Explain whatvaginal, anal/rectal or oral sex. AIDS is also the termstransmitted through blood to blood contact with vaginal,anal,an infected person. This happens most rectal, andfrequently through sharing intravenous drug oral sexneedles and syringes, works. It can also occur mean.by sharing tattoo needles, razors, toothbrushes,or any other item that may puncture the skin orallow contaminated blood into an open cut orwound.AIDS can also be transmitted from aninfected mother to her unborn child.Even after all these years of studying thousandsof AIDS cases, no other methods of transmissionhave been found. There is no evidence that AIDS 1.s transmittedearough: Being t..losely associated with an infectedperson on a daily basis;Shaking hands, touching, or other non-sexualphysical contact with an infected person;Using utensils, trays, sheets, towels or food Appendix D173 Instructor Notes that has been touched or used by an infectedperson; Coming into contact with toilet seats,showers, recreational equipment, or any otherfacilities used by an infected person;Being sneezed on, coughed on, or spit at byan infected person. There is no evidence that being in prisonincreases the risk of developing AIDS. Nearlyall of the inmates who have developed AIDS had aprevious history of intravenous drug use, orshooting up, or homosexual activities Inmateswho have not engaged in homosexual activity,intravenous drug use, tattooing, or sexualactivity with someone infected with the virushave no greater risk of developing AIDS than anyother person. Furthermore, no cases of AIDS have resulted fromcasual contact. No health care workers, such asdoctors, nurses, dentists or orderlies, havecontracted AIDS from routinely taking care ofAIDS patients. Even where children have played,eaten, slept, kissed and fought with a brotheror sister with AIDS, none have become infected.No one has ever contracted AIDS at work, evenafter all these years. SYMPTOMS OF AIDSThe symptoms of AIDS are persistent andunexplained.They include:unusual fatigue nodes; mean.chronic diarrhea; Show slides 174 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES I I\"; -^sJ.. 10 Instructor Notes 8,#9d,9 & 10 -dry cough and/or shortness of breath; examples ofThrush/Yeastwhite patches inside of mouth; Infection &Kaposisunusual bruising or bleeding; Sarcoma.brownish, reddish, or bluish skin spots; DIAGNOSIS OF AIDSThe diagnosis of AIDS must be made by aphysician using laboratory tests. WHO IS AT RISK OF AIDS?AIDS RISK GROUPS EVERYONE IS AT RISK according to their behavior.AIDS is not a disease of gay or bisexual men,but it affects children, heterosexuals, peoplewho have had blood transfusions, IV drugabusers, black, white, Hispanic, rich and poor.THE AIDS VIRUS DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE.The AIDS epidemic has occurred in particulargroups of people who engage in high-riskbehaviors.This slide describes the Show slidedistribution of cases by risk group. The risk #4.groups are:Gay or bisexual men (66%)Homosexuals who are IV Drug Users (17%)Hemophiliacs (1%)Heterosexuals (4%)Transfusion Recipients (2%)Undetermined (3%).REMEMBER inmates who get tattooedare considered at risk.The Undetc mined group does nct represent adifferent method of transmission. These peoplewere either lost to \"follow-up\"; I)-- ,-...t.idShow slide#7. Appendix D175 Instructor Notes died before their case could be thoroughlyinvestigated.The important points to understand about AIDSrisk groups are:Risk groups are associated with high-riskbehaviors; Sexual contact with anyone who is a riskgroup member or has been the partner of arisk group member puts a person at risk ofacquiring the infection. THE AIDS ANTIBODY TEST A blood test has been developed to determinewhether or not a person has been exposed to thevirus.All the test measures is whether o- notone has been exposed to the virus, and producedantibodies: Having a positive test could mean only one ofthree things: ASYMPTOMATIC CARRIER: A person who has thevirus in their body, but has no symptomsof the disease.AIDS RELATED COMPLEX (ARC): A person whohas symptoms associated with AIDS and isnot able to fight off ..nfection as well asa healthy person.AIDS: A person who is immune suppressed,and has a life threatening infection. SO, A POSITIVE TEST DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVEAIDS OR THAT YOU WILL BECOME ILL WITH AIDS.A POSITIVE TEST DOES MEAF, THAT YOU CAN INFECTOTHERS WITH THE VIRUS, and you must takeprecautions to prevent spreading the infection. 176 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES TO RECAP:AIDS is not spread casual contact. In orderto infect someone, the virus must enter thebloodstream through either sexual contact ordirect contact with infected blood. You cannotget AIDS from:Toilet seats (the virus doesn't live longoutside the body and it can't get directlyinto the bloodstream from a toilet seat)Sharing eating a cup,telephones, work equipment, waterfountains, doorknobs, etc.People who sneeze, cough, cry around you.(The virus is blood borne, unlike the fluor a cold, which are airborne).Physical contact that is not sexualcontact such as hugging, shaking hands,etc.The risky behavior involves sharingblood, semen, and vaginal secretions. AIDS is spread hy sexual contact the sharingof contaminated needles or blood products andfrom infected women to their infants.Therefore, .%o protect yourself: Don't share items that could draw blood,such as razors, tattoo needles, IV drugneedles or toothbrushes;Do not engage in sexual activity;Wash well with hot water and soap aftercoming into contact with someone else'sbodily fluids. The AIDS virus is veryfragile, weak, outside the body and willbe killed.Crean up spills of blood and other bodilyfluids using industrial strengthdisinfectant, the kind in use in prison. AFTER RELEASE OR ON LEAVEInstructor Notes Appendix D 177 After release or while on leave, there arefurther steps you can take to minimize,reduce, your risk for getting AIDS:Know and limit your number of sexualpartners;Use condoms to avoid the exchange ofbodily fluids;Never share needles. In closing, if you feel that you may havesymptoms of ARC or AIDS you should see themedical staff. You can be assured that you willreceive the best treatment possible.Now for next 40 minutes, we will be watching avideo film developed by inmates for inmates a*.the Taconic State Prison in New York State.After tl-e video, we will have time to answer anyquestio .4 which you may have. 178AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIESI1(5 RIVELAND, SECRETARYAI0 %Ear LESSON PLAN FOR STAFF OFFENDERS OCTOBER 1987 1 r) ,7-L.C.1 ciAppendix D181 _Ai DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONSEMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT & TRAINING TITLEAIDS TRAINING FOR STAFF TRAINERS INTRODUCTION 1.Introduction of self and assistant2.Sign H.R.D.I.S.

It has been called HTLV; Human T-Lymphocytic Virus Type III; throughout the training we call it HIV. WHAT IS THE IMMUNE SYSTEM? Slide #6, 9/87In order to understand the virus, you must first understand thebody's immune system.The body's immune system defends itself in several ways. One is,..he skin, an external protection. Another is the immune system, aninternal protection.The internal system defends us against attacks by \"foreign\"invaders.When working properly itfights off infections frombacteria, viruses, etc.When it is not, we are defenseless againsteverything from allergies to cancer. It works by identifying\"antigens\" or \"foreigners.\" This triggers an immune response. Twotypes of cells are the primary soldiers in this response. They areboth Lymphocytes. They are called B cells and T cells. B cellsmake antibodies.These exactly match a specific antigen. Thereare two types of T cells:1) \"helper\" cells that turn on B cells; and2) \"suppressor\" cells that turn them off. The AIDS virus affectsthe \"helper\" T cells, causing low levels of \"helpers\" and normallevels of \"suppressor\" cells. This imbalance causes a defect in theimmune system, leaving the body open to infections. RESPONSE TO THE VIRUS - Signs and SymptomsOnce an individual has been Infected with HIV, most becomecarriers of the virus and can infect others. But, there are threepossible physical responses: 184 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES157 DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONSEMPLOYEE DEVELOPMENT & TRAINING TITLEAIDS TRAINING FOR STAFF TRAINERS .No signs or symptoms:*Doesn't look or feel sick*May or may not become sick*Doesn't know he/she is infected*Can infect others .AIDS Related Complex (ARC):*Lymphadenopathy*Symptoms such as:Unusual fatigue or listlessnessunexplained weight losspersistent fever of 100 degrees or morerecurrent drenching night sweatschronic unexplained diarrhea*May or may n.c..t progress to AIDS; brownish, spots on the skin)*CNS deficiencies (memory loss, forgetfulness,confusion,change in coordination, delusions, slurred speech)*Wasting syndrome*Can infect others*Fatal WHERE THE VIRUS IS FOUND IN THE BODY High Risk Body FluidsBLOODSEMENVAGINAL SECRETIONS Low & TRAINING TITLEAIDS TRAINING FOR STAFF TRAINERS NOTES:At this time, no cases of AIDS are known to have been transmittedby urine, tears, saliva or feces. CDC has studied families ofpersons with AIDS.

This immune failure is due to infection of the lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell) by a virusknown as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Persons with HIV infection develop Ile-threatening infections or certain cancers, including Kaposis sarcoma.Many persons infected with HIV may develop an Illness known as AIDSRelated Complex, and some may dove* noilinoss at all. Much is still unknown about the long-term &foots of HIV infection.illnoss does occur, symptoms may include significant unexplained weight loss, porsistent swotting of lymphnodes, unoxplainod foyer lasting for several weeks, unexplained diarrhea lasting for weeks, rocurront yoastinfections in the mouth, and recurring episodes of unexplained sweating during the night. How is the Virus Spread?Tho virus is spread from an infected person to others by sexual contact, by blood or blocd products, or bysharing needles used for injecting drugs.A woman infected with the virus can give it to her unborn or newborn child. It is not known whethor spread frommother to child occurs before the child is born, at the time of birth, or during the first few days or weeks after birth. Itis possible that spread could occur at alt these times.it may be possible that an infected person can expose others through saliva during oral-genital contact or withkissing involving the exchange of saliva, although this has never been shown to happen. What Does a Hortative Test Mean?if one of the following descriptiors applies to you, your negative test result may not necessarily mean that youhave not been exposed to the virus that causes AIDS. This is because it is not yet known how frequently personswho are well, yet infected with the virus, may have a 'false negative\" rest. A \"false negative' test means that the testdoes not detect antibody against the HIV virus, even though the person has boon Infected. This can happen becauseof technical problems in the laboratory, or because a person's immune system may not develop antibody against thevirus until some time after infection. At present, it is believed that a person will develop antibodies within 12 weeks ofbecoming infected. The risk group descriptions are1. Male who has sexual contact with another man since 19772. User of intravenous drugs3. Hemophiliac4. Person with multiple heterosexual contacts, especially prostitutes5. Sexual partner of a person with HIV infection or a person at Increased risk ofexposure to HIV (i.e., one of the above)Additionally, if you continue to have one of the above risk factors, a negative antibody test does not protect you fromrisk of exposure in the future.Therefore even though YOU have had anectative HIV antibodvjest. you should follow aoostions atlimes in the future;1. Refrain from donating blood or plasma, sperm for artificial insemination, and body organs or tissues fortransplantation.2. Avoid exposing others through sexual contact. You can do this by using safer sex practices or byabstinence. Ask your counselor for more information.3. Avoid sharing of needles for Injecting drugs.4. if you are a woman of childbearing age, you should not consider pregnancy until more is known about the riskof transmission of infection from a mother to her newborn infant.5.Avoid sharing toothbrushes, razors, or other implements that could become contaminated with blood.6. Avoid risk of being exposed to HIV by limiting your sexual partners, using safer sexual practices, andavoiding sexual contact with persons known to be HIV positive.For further Information about \"safer soxual practices' plc.'s\u00b0 talk with your counselor now.

This means that the blood specimen you submitted showed evidence of theprosence of HIV antibody on three separate ELISA tests, along with a postive result on the IFA test. This almostcertainly means that you have been infected with HIV. it probably means that you are still carrying the virus and caninfect others through sexual contact, sharing needles, or donating blood, plasma, sperm, or tissues or organs. Your positive test result does not necessarihtmean that you will develop AIDS,There is a very small chance that your test resuhs could be falsely positive. If th:s is the case, you may neverhave been exposed to HIV. but may have had a positive resut :arise the test cross-reacted with something else inyour blood, or because .;f ct_ctilical problem in the laboratcry. What is AIDS?Acqt.'red immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a serious illness resulting from failure of an important part of theimmune system. This immune failure is due to infection of the lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) by a virus knownas human iminunodeficiency virus (HIV).Persons with HIV infections may develop life threatening infections or certain cancers, incluc g Kaposi'ssarcoma. Many persons infected with HIV may develop an illness known as AIDS-Related Complex, and some maydevelop no illness at all. Much is stilt unknown about the longterm effects of HIV infection.If illness does occur, symptoms may include significant unexplained weight loss, persistent swelling of lymphnodes, unexplained revel lasting for several weeks, unexplained diarrhea lasting for weeks, recurrent yeastinfections in the mouth, and recurring episodes of unexplained sweating during the night. How is the Virus Spread?The virus is spread from an infected person others by sexual contact, by blood or blood products, or bysharing needles used for injecting drugs.A woman infected with the virus can give it to her unborn or newborn child. his not known whether spread frommother to child occurs before the child is born, at the time of birth, or during the first few days or weeks after birth. Itis possible that spread could occur at all these times.It may be possible that an infected person can expose others through saliva during oralgenital contact or withkissing involving the exchange of saliva, ahhough this has never been shown to happen. What Should You Do because of Your Positive Antibody Test?1. You should ask to submit another blood specimen for testing, just to be sure that a technical problem in thelaboratory did not cause your first specimen to oe falsely positive.2. Ye:: ztiluuld see a doctor for an examination. Be sure to choose a doctor with whom you can form acomfortable relationship for followup examinations. If you do not have a regular doctor, ask the person who gave youthis form to suggest a list of names from which you can choose. .3,If your doctor finds no evidence of AIDS-related illness by examination, you should plan to visit him or her forreevaluation at least twice a year. If significant, unexplained weight loss, unexplained fever, unexplained diarrhea,yeast infections in your mouth, persistent lymph node swelling, or severe sweating during the night occur betweenyour routine doctor visits, you should seok medical care right away. 4.If your doctor does find evidence of AIDS related illness by examination, you should follow his or her advicefor further evaluation.5. You should understand that you will probably remain infected with this virus indefinitely. This means that youmay spread this infection to others, even if you remain well. To avoid exposing others you should:a. Refrain from donating blood or plasma, sperm for artificial insemination, and body organs or tissues fortransplantation.b. Avoid exposing others through sexual contact. You can do this by using safer sex practices or byabstinence. Ask your counselor for more information.

The most serious form ofillness caused by the virus is AIDS, which involvesloss of the body's natural immune defenses againstdisease.The AIDS virus is primarily spread by sexual con-tact and by sharing of contaminated needles andsyringes among users of intravenous drugs. The viruscan also be transmitted from infected mothers totheir babies during pregnancy, at birth, or shortlyafter birth (probably through breast milk). In a smallnumber of cases, the virus has been spread throughblood transfusions and through blood products usedto treat patients with hemophilia and other bloodclotting disorders.IMIIP11/111121112The AIDS Antibody TestAntibodies are substances prodaced in the blood tofight disease organisms. When antibodies to a specificorganism are found in a person's blood, they indicatethat the person has been infect'd by that particularorganism.Since spring 1985, a test for antibody to the AIDSvirus has been used by blood collection centers tokeep donated blood and plasma that might carry thevirus from becoming part of the nation's blood sup-ply. The antibody test is also availablethroughprivate physicians and at clinics in most statestopeople who may want to know their antibody status.Those considered to be at risk of infection includemen who have had sex with another man since 1977;people who inject illegal drugs, or who have done soin the past; people with symptoms that suggest AIDSvirus infection; people from Haiti and Central African 'Me virus that causes AIDS and related disorders has several differentnames: HTIIII, LA' ARV and most rece74.

Occa-sionally, however, a person may have a positive testresult even though he or she has never been exposedto the AIDS virus. This is called a \"false positive\"reaction. To be sure that the test result is truly posi-tive, the test is repeated, and in some cases adifferent type of laboratory test may also beperformedA positive test result does not mean that you willget AIDSmany people with a positive test eitherremain free of symptoms or develop less serious ill-nesses. The antibody test cannot tell you whether youwill eventually develop signs of illness related to AIDSvirus infectionor, if you do, how serious that ill-ness might be.A positive test result does indicate that you havebeen infected by the AIDS virus and most probablycan transmit it to others, even if you show no symp-toms. It's likely that you will carry the virus in yourbody throughout your life.How Can I Protect My Health?After getting the results of your test, you should see adoctor for a checkup and follow-up care. Your doctorwill want to discuss your situation with you thor-oughly, answer your questions, make sure that youreceive the counseling you need, and check you atregular intervals to help you maintain your health. 208 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES111=1..laillAINI.4111ENC44.111111How Can I Protect Others?To protect others from getting the virus from you,there are some important steps you should take:Be sure to tell your sex partners about your posi-tive test result. Avoiding sex would eliminate anyrisk of spreading the virus by sexual means; how-ever, if you and your partner decide to go ahead,be careful to protect him or her from contact withyour body fluids, which may carry the AIDS virus.(\"Body fluids\" includes blood, semen, urine,feces, saliva, and vaginal secretions.) Use a con-dom, which will help reduce the chances ofspreading the virus, and avoid practices, such asanal intercourse, that may injure body tissues andmake it easier for the virus to enter the blood-stream. Oral-genital contact should also beavoided, as should open-mouthed, intimate kissing.People who have been your sex partners may havebeen exposed to the AIDS virus. If you have usedintravenous drugs, anyone you have sharedneedles and syringes with may have been exposedtoo. You should tell these persons about your posi-tive test result and urge them to seek counselingand antibody testing from a doctor or healthclinic.Don't share toothbrushes, razors, tweezers, orother items that could become contaminated withblood.If you use drugs, consider enrolling in a drugtreatment program to help protect your health.Remember that needles and other dreg equipmentmust never be shared.Don't dcnate blood or plasma, body organs, otherbody Us,.or sperm.Clean spills of blood or other body fluids onhousehold or other surfaces with freshly dilutedhousehold bleachone part bleach to 10 partswater. (Don't use bleach on wounds.)When you seek medical help, tell the doctor, den-tist, eye doctor, or other health worker who givesyou care about your positive AIDS antibody test, sothat steps can be taken to protect you and others. If you are a woman with a positive test result, con-sider aw\",ling pregnancy until more is knownabout i.,e risks of transmitting the AIDS virus toyour baby. If you do become pregnant, it's impor-tant to see a doctor for regular care during yourpregnancy. Because the AIDS virus has been foundin breast milk, you should not breastfeed yourbaby.What About the OrdinaryActivities of My Daily Life?You should be careful to follow the normal practiceseveryone needs to maintain good health: Eat a well-balanced diet, exercise, rest, and try to manage yourlife in a way that avoids undue stress. But there's noreason to change your activities in ways beyond thosethat have already been discussed.Your positive test stams should not affect your con-tacts with people at work or in social situations.Special precautions are not necessary: The AIDS virusis not spread by ordinary nonsexual contact such asshaking hands, sharing an office, coughing or sneez-ing, preparing or serving food, or sharing toiletfacilities.Your relationships with family members andfriends should continue to be close and supportive.Hugging, kissing on the cheek, and other forms ofaffectionate behavior that don't involve exchange ofbody fluids do not spread the AIDS virus.It should be stressed that scientists have not founda single instance in which the AIDS virus has beentransmitted through ordinary nonsexual contact in afamily, work, or social setting.A Final Word. . .The news that you have had a positive result on yourAIDS antibody test is not easy to receive. For yourfollow-up care, it's best to establish a close relation-ship with a doctor you trust, so that you can speakopenly about your feelings, problems, and any fearsyou may have. Above all, ask questionsand seekassurance from any health professional who takescare of you that all information related to your healthwill be kept in the strictest confidence.The U.S. Public Health Seivice has made AIDS andother AIDS virus-related illnesses its number one pri-ority. Scientists all over the country are working tofind ways to eliminate the AIDS virus as a threat tohealth.

Pettey*. Theilend MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WEEKLY REPORT Perspectives in Disease Prevention and Health Promotion Public Health Service Guidelines for Counseling andAntibody Testing to Prevent HIV Infection and AIDS These guidelines are the outgrowth of the 1986 recommendations pub-lished in the MMWR (1 ); the report on the February 24-25, 1987, Conferenceon Counseling and Testing (2 ); and a series of meetings with representativesfrom the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Associationof State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors, the Council ofState and Territorial Epidemiologists, the National Association of CountyHealth Officials, the United States Conference of Local Health Officers, andthe National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of acquiredimmunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related clinical manifestations, hasbeen shown to be spread by sexual contact; by parenteral exposure to blood(most often through intravenous [IV) drug abuse) and, rarely, by otherexposures to blood; and from an infected woman to her fetus or infant.Persons exposed to HIV usually develop detectable levels of antibodyagainst the virus within 6-12 weeks of infection. The presence of antibodyindicates current infection, though many infected persons may have minimalor no clinical evidence of disease for years. Counseling and testing personswho are infected or at risk for acquiring HIV infection is an importantcomponent of prevention strategy (1). Most of the estimated 1.0 to 1.5million infected persons in the United States are unaware that they areinfected with HIV. The primary public health purposes of counseling andtesting are to help uninfected individuals initiate and sustain behavioralchanges that reduce their risk of becoming infected and to assist infectedindividuals in avoiding infecting others.Along with the potential personal, medical, and public health benefits oftesting for HIV antibody, public health agencies must be concerned aboutactions that will discourage the use of counseling and testing facilities, mostnotably the unauthorized disclosure of personal information and the possi-bility of inappropriate discrimination. 213 Appendix E 219 Priorities for public health counseling and testing should be based uponproviding ready access to persons who are most likely to be infected or whopractice high-risk behaviors, thereby helping to reduce further spread ofinfection. There are other considerations for determining testing priorities,including the likely effectiveness of preventing the spread of infection amongpersons who would not otherwise realize that they are at risk. Knowledge ofthe prevalence of HIV infection in different populations is useful in determin-ing the most efficient and effective locations providing such services. Forexample, programs that offer counseling and testing to homosexual men,IV-drug abusers, persons with hemophilia, sexual and/or needle-sharingpartners of these persons, and patients of sexually transmitted diseaseclinics may be most effective since persons in these groups are at high riskfor infection. After counseling and testing are effectively implemented insettings of high and moderate prevalence, consideration should be given toestablishing programs in settings of lower prevalence.Interpretation of HIV-Antibody Test ResultsA test for HIV antibody is considered positive when a sequence of tests,starting with a repeatedly reactive enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and includingan additional, more specific assay, such as a Western blot, 0 .e consistentlyreactive.The sensitivity of the currently licensed EIA tests is 99% or greater whenperformed under optimal laboratory conditions. Given this performance, theprobability of a false-negative test result is remote, except during the firstweeks after infection, before antibody is detectable.The specificity of the currently licensed EIA tests is approximately 99%when repeatedly reactive tests are considered. Repeat testing of specimensinitially reactive by EIA is required to reduce the likelihood of false-positivetest results due to laboratory error. To further increase the specificity of thetesting process, laboratories must use a supplemental test most often theWestern blot test to validate repeatedly reactive EIA results. The sensitivityof the licensed Western blot test is comparable to that of the EIA, and it ishighly specific when strict criteria are used for interpretation. Under idealcircumstances, the probability that a testing sequence will be falsely positivein a population with a low rate of infection ranges from less than 1 in 100,000(Minnesota Department of Health, unpublished data) tc ln estimated 5 in100,000 (3,4 ). Laboratories using different Western blot reagents or othertests or using less stringent interpretive criteria may experience higher ratesof false-positive results.Laboratories should carefully guard against human errors, which are likelyto be the most common source of false-positive test results. All laboratoriesshould anticipate the need for assuring quality perfon 3nce of tests for HIVantibody by training personnel, establishing quality controls, and participat-ing in performance evaluation systems. Health department laboratoriesshould facilitate the quality assurance of the performance of laboratories intheir jurisdiction. 220 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Guidelines for Counseling and Testing for HIV AntibodyThese guidelines are based on public health considerations for HIV testing,including the principles of counseling before and after testing, confidentialityof personal information, and the understanding that a person may decline tobe tested without being denied health are or other services, except wheretesting is required by law (5 ). Counseling before testing may not be practicalwhen screening for HIV antibody is required. This is true for donors of blood,organs, and tissue; prisoners; and immigrants for whom testing is a Federalrequirement as well as for persons admitted to state correctional institutionsin states that require testing. When there is no counseling before testing,persons should be informed that testing for HIV antibody will be performed,that individual results will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law,and that appropriate counseling will be offered. Individual counseling ofthose who are either HIV-antibody positive or at continuing risk for HI%infection is critical for reducing further transmission and for ensuring timciymedical care.Specific recommendations follow:1. Persons who may have sexually transmitted disease. All pern,cfs seekingtreatment for a sexually transmitted disease, in all health/Care settingsincluding the offices of private physicians, should be routinely coup'and tested for HIV antibody.2. /V-drug abusers. All persons seeking treatment for IV-drug ;;s4.,having a history of IV-drug abuse should be routinely coup,tested for HIV antibody. Medical professionals in all health-care ,s,including prison clinics, should seek a history of IV-drug abuse frompatients and should be aware of its implications for HIV infection. Inaddition, state and local health policy makers should address the follow-ing issues:Treatment programs for IV-drug abusers should be sufficiently avail-able to allow persons seeking assistance to enter promptly and beencouraged to alter the behavior that places them and others at risk forHIV infection.Outreach programs for IV-drug abusers should be undertaken toincrease their knowledge of AIDS and of ways to prevent HIV infection,to encourage them to obtain counseling and testing for HIV antibody,and to persuade them to be treated for substance abuse.3. Persons who consider themselves at risk. All persons who considerthemselves at risk for HIV infection should be counseled and offendtesting for HIV antibody. \"Routine counseling and testing\" is defined as a pe!lcy to provide these services toe!! clients after informing them that testing will be doria, Except where testing isrequired by law, individuals have the right to decline to be tested without beingdenied health care or other services. Appendix E22121 71 4. Women of childbearing age. All women of childbeF -ig age with identifi-able risks for HIV infection should be routinely counseled and tested forHIV antibody, regardless of the health-care setting. Each encounter be-tween a health-care provider and a woman at risk and/or her sexualpartners is an opportunity to reach them with information and educationabout AIDS and prevention of HIV infection. Women are at risk for HIVInfection if they:a Have used IV drugs.Have engaged in prostitution. Have had sexual partners who are infected or are at risk for infectionbecause they are bisexual or are IV-drug abusers or hemophiliacs.Are living in communities or were born in countries where there is aknown or suspected high prevalence of infection among women.Received a transfusion before blood was being screened for HIV antibody but after HIV infection occurred in the United States (e.g., between 1978 and 1985).Educating and testing these women before they become pregnant allowsthem to avoid pregnancy and subsequent intrauterine perinatal infectionof their infants (30%-50% of the infants born to HIV-infected women willalso be infected).All pregnant women at risk for HIV infection should be routinelycounseled and tested for HIV antibody. Identifying pregnant women withHIV infection as early in pregnancy as possible is important for ensuringappropriate medical care for these women; for planning medical care fortheir infants; and for providing counseling on family planning, futurepregnancies, and the risk of sexual transmission of HIV to others.All women who seek family planning services and who are at risk for HIVinfection should be routinely counseled about AIDS and HIV infection andtested for HIV antibody. Decisions about the need for counseling andtesting programs in a community should be based on the best availableestimates of the prevalence of HIV infection and the demographic vari-ables of infection.5. Persons planning marriage. All persons considering marriage should begiven information about AIDS, HIV infection, and the availability ofcounseling and testing for HIV antibody. Decisions about institutingroutine or mandatory premarital testing for HIV antibody should take intoaccount the prevalence of C.;',/ infection in the area and/or populationgroup as well as other factors and should be based upon the likelycost-effectiveness of such testing in preventir ; further spread of infection.Premarital testing in an area with a prevalence of HIV infection as low as0.1% may be justified if reaching an infected person through testing canprevent subsequent transm;-- n to the spouse or prevent pregnancy in awoman who is infected. 222 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES2-6 6. Persons undergoing medical evaluation or treatment. Testing for HIVantibody is a useful diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with selectedclinical signs and symptoms such as generalized lymphadenopathy;unexplained dementia; chronic, unexplained fever or diarrhea; unex-plained weight loss; or diseases such as tuberculosis as well as sexuallytransmitted diseases, generalized herpes, and chronic candidiasis.Since persons infected with both HIV and the tubercle bacillus are athigh risk for severe clinical tuberculosis, all patients with tuberculosisshould be routinely counseled and tested for HIV antibody (6). Guidelinesfor managing patients with both HIV and tuberculous infection have beenpublished (7 ).The risk of HIV infection from transfusions of blood or blood compo-nents from 1978-1985 was greatest for persons receiving large numbers ofunits of blood collected from areas with high incidences of AIDS. Personswho have this increased risk should be counseled about the potential riskof HIV infection and should be offered antibody testing (8).7. Persons admitted to hospitals. Hospitals, in conjunction with state andlocal health departments, should periodically determine the prevalence ofHIV infections in the age groups at highest risk for infection. Considerationshould be given to routine testing in those age groups deemed to have ahigh prevalence of HIV infection.8. Persons in correctional systems. Correctional systems should study thebest means of implementing programs for counseling inmates about HIVinfection and for testing them for such infection at admission anddischarge from the system. In particular, they should examine the useful-ness of these programs in preventing further transmissic..) of HIV infectionand the impact of the testing programs on both the inmates and thecorrectional system (9). Federal prisons have been instructed to test allprisoners when they enter and leave the prison system.9. Prostitutes. Male and female prostitutes should be J unseled and testedand made aware of the risks of HIV infection to themselves and others.Particularly prostitutes who are HIV-antibody positive should be in-structed to discontinue the practice of prostitution. Local or state jurisdic-tions should adopt procedures to assure that these instructions arefollowed.Partner Notification/Contact TracingSexual partners and those who share needles with HIV-infected personsare at risk for HIV infection and should be routinely counseled and tested forHIV antibody. Persons who are HIV-antibody positive should be instructed inhow to notify their partners and to refer them for counseling and testing. Ifthey are unwilling to notify their ;)artners or if it cannot be assured that theirpartners will seek counseling, ph,..7'.;ans or health department personnelshould use confidential procedures to assure that the partners are notified. 2 Appendix E 223 Confidentiality and Antidiscrimination ConsiderationsThe ability of health departments, hospitals, and other health-care provid-ers and institutions to assure confidentiality of patient information and thepublic's confidence in that ability are crucial to efforts to increase the numberof persons being counseled and tested for HIV infection. Moreover, to assurebroad participation in the counseling and testing programs, it is of equal orgreater importance that the public perceive that persons found to be positivewill not be subject to inappropriate discrimination.Every reasonable effort should be made to improve confidentiality of testresults. The confidentiality of related records can be improved by a carefulreview of actual record-keeping practices and by assessing the degree towhich these records can be protected under applicable state laws. State lawsshould be examined and strengthened when found necessary. Because ofthe wide scope of \"need-to-knows situations, because of the possibility ofinappropriate disclosures, and because of established authorization proce-dures for releasing records, it is recognized that there is no perfect solutionto confidentiality problems in all situations. Whether disclosures of HIV-testing information are deliberate, inadvertent, or simply unavoidable, publichealth policy needs to carefully consider ways to reduce the harmful impactof such disclosures.Public health prevention policy to reduce the transmission of HIV infectioncan be furthered by an expanded program of counseling and testing for HIVantibody, but the extent to which these programs are successful depends onthe level of participation. Persons are more likely to participate in counselingand testing programs if they believe that they will not experience negativeconsequences in areas such as employment, sch...ol admission, housing, andmedical services should they test positive. There is no known medical reasonto avoid an infected person in these and ordinary social situations since thecumulative evidence is strong that HIV infection is not spread through casualcontact. It is essential to the success of counseling and testing programs thatpersons who are tested for HIV are not subjected to inappropriate discrimi-nation. References1. CDC.

HIV hasbeen isolated from blood, semen, vaginal secretions, saliva, tears, breast milk,cerebrospinal fluid, amniotic fluid, and urine and is likely to be isolated from otherbody fluids, secretions, and excretions. However, epidemiologic evidence has impli-cated only blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and possibly breast milk in transmission.The increasing prevalence of HIV increases the risk that health-care workers will beexposed to blood from patients infected with HIV, especially when blood and body-fluid precautions are not followed for all patients. Thus, this document emphasizesthe need for health-care workers to consider all patients as potentially infected withHIV and/or other blood-borne pathogens and to adhere rigorously to infection-controlprecautions for minimizing the risk of exposure to blood and body fluids of allpatients.The recommendations contained in this document consolidate and update CDCrecommendations published earlier for preventing HIV transmission in health-caresettings: precautions for clinical and laboratory staffs (1) and precautions forhealth-care workers and allied professionals (2); recorr <%ndations for preventingHIV transmission in the workplace (3) and during invasive procedures (4 ); recom-mendations for preventing possible transmission of HIV from tears (5 ); and recom-mendations for providing dialysis treatment for HIV-infected patients (6). Theserecommendations also update portions of the \"Guideline for Isolation Precautions inilospitals\" (7) and reemphasize some of the recommendations contained in \"InfectionControl Practices for Dentistry (8). The recommendations contained in this docu-ment have been developed for use in health-care settings and emphasize the need totreat blood and other body fluids from all patients as potentially infective. These sameprudent precautions also should be taken in other settings in which persons may beexposed to blood or other body fluids. Definition of Health-Care WorkersHealth-care workers are defined as persons, including students and trainees,whose activities involve contact with patients or with blood or other body fluids frompatients in a health-care setting. Appendix E 225 4S MMWR August 21, 1987 Health-Care Workers with AIDSAs of July 10, 1987, a total of 1,875 (5.8%) of 32,395 adults with AIDS, who had beenreported to the CDC national surveillance system and for whom occupationalinformation was available, reported being employed in a health-care or clinicallaboratory setting. In comparison, 6.8 million persons representing 5.6% of the U.S.labor forcewere employed in health services. Of the health-care workers with AIDS,95% have been reported to exhibit high-risk behavior; for the remaining 5%, themeans of HIV acquisition was undetermined. Health-care workers with AIDS weresignificantly more likely than other workers to have an undetermined risk (5% versus3%, respectively). For both health-care workers- and non-health-care workers withAIDS, the proportion with an undetermined risk has not increased since 1982.AIDS patients initially reported as not belonging to recognized risk groups areinvestigated by state and local health departments to determine whether possible riskfactors exist. Of all health-care workers with AIDS reported to CDC who were initiallycharacterized as not having an identified risk and for whom follow-up informationwas available, 66% have been reclassified because risk factors were identified orbecause the patient was found not to meet the surveillance case definition for AIDS.Of the 87 haalth-care workers currently categorized as having no identifiable risk,information is incomplete on 16 (18%) because of death or refusal to be interviewed;38 (44%) are still being investigated. The remaining 33 (38%) health-care workerswere interviewed or had other follow-up information available. The occupations ofthese 33 were as follows: five physicians (15%), three of whom were surgeons; onedentist (3%); three nurses (9%); nine nursing assistants (27%); seven housekeepingor maintenance workers (21%); three clinical laboratory technicians (9%); onetherapist (3%); and four others who did not have contact with patients (12%).Although 15 of these 33 health-care workers reported parenteral and/or othernon-needlestickexposuretobloodorbodyfluidsfrompatientsinthe10 years preceding their diagnosis of AIDS, none of these exposures involved apatient with AIDS or known HIV infection. Risk to Health-Care Workers of Acquiring HIV in Health-CareSettingsHealth-care workers with documented percutaneous or mucous-membrane expo-sures to blood or body fluids of HIV-infected patients have been prospectivelyevaluated to determine the risk of infection after such exposures. As of June 30, 1987,883 health-care workers have been tested for antibody to HIV in an ongoingsurveillance project conducted by CDC (9 ). Of these, 708 (80%) had percutaneousexposures to blood, and 175 (20%) had a mucous membrane or an open woundcontaminated by blood or body fluid. Of 396 health-care workers, each of whom hadonly a convalescent-phase serum sample obtained and tested ?-90 days post-exposure, one for whom heterosexual transmission could not be ruled outwasseropositive for HIV antibody. For 425 additional health-care workers, both acute- andconvalescent-phase serum samples were obtained and tested; none of 74 health-careworkers with nonpercutaneous exposures seroconverted, and three (0.9%) of 351 226AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 36 / No. 2S MMWR 5S with percutaneous exposures seroconverted. None of these three health-care workershad other documented risk factors for infection.Two other prospective studies to assess the risk of nosocomial acquisition of HIVinfection for health-care workers are ongoing in the United States. As of April 30,1987, 332 health-care workers with a total of 453 needlestick or mucous-membraneexposures to the blood or other body fluids of HIV-infected patients were tested forHIV antibody at the National Institutes of Health (10). These exposed workersincluded 103 with needlestick injuries and 229 with mucous-membrane exposures;none had seroconverted. A similar study at the University of California of 129health-care workers with documented needlestick injuries or mucous-membraneexposures to blood or other body fluids from patients with HIV infection has notidentified any seroconversions (11). Results of a prospective study in the UnitedKingdom identified no evidence of transmission among 150 health-care workers withparenteral or mucous-membrane exposures to blood or other body fluids, secretions,or excretions from patients with HIV infection (12).In addition to health-care workers enrolled in prospective studies, eight personswho provided care to infected patients and denied other risk factors have beenreported to have acquired HIV infection. Three of these health -care workers hadneedlestick exposures to blood from infected patients (13-15). Two were personswho provided nursing care to infected persons; although neither sustained aneedlestick, both had extensive contact with blood or other body fluids, and neitherobserved recommended barrier precautions (16,17). The other three were health-care workers with non-needlestick exposures to blood from infected patients (18).Although the exact route of transmission for these last three infections is not known,all three persons had direct contact of their skin with blood from infected patients, allhad skin lesions that may have been contaminated by blood, and one also had amucous-membrane exposure.A total of 1,231 dentists and hygienists, many of whom practiced in areas withmany AIDS cases, participated in a study to determine the prevalence of antibody toHIV; one dentist (0.1%) had HIV antibody. Although no exposure to a knownHIV-infected person could be documented, epidemiologic investigation did notidentify any other risk factor for infection. The infected dentist, who also had a historyof sustaining needlestick injuries and trauma to his hands, did not routinely weargloves when providing dental care (19). Precautions To Prevent Transmission of HIVUniversal PrecautionsSince medical history and examination cannot reliably identify all patients infectedwith HIV or other blood-borne pathogens, blood and body-fluid precautions shouldbe consistently used for all patients. This approach, previously recommended by CDC(3,4), and referred to as \"universal blood and body-fluid precautions\" or \"universalprecautions: should be used in the care of all patients, especially including those inemergencycare settings in which the risk of blood exposure is increased and theinfection status of the patient is usually unknown (20). Appendix E 227 MMWR August 21, 1987 1. All health-care workers should routinely use appropriate barrier precautions toprevent skin and mucous-membrane exposure when contact with blood orother body fluids of any patient is anticipated. Gloves should be worn fortouching blood and body fluids, mucous membranes, or non-intact skin of allpatients, for handling items or surfaces soiled with blood or body fluids, and forperforming venipuncture and other vascular access procedures. Gloves shouldbe changed after contact with each patient. Masks and protective eyewear orface shields should be worn during procedures that are likely to generatedroplets of blood or other body fluids to prevent exposure of mucous mem-branes of the mouth, nose, and eyes. Gowns or aprons should be worn duringprocedures that are likely to generate splashes of blood or other body fluids.2. Hands and other skin surfaces should be washed immediately and thoroughlyif contaminated with blood or other body fluids. Hands should be washedimmediately after gloves are removed.a All health-care workers should take precautions to prevent injuries caused byneedles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices during procedures;when cleaning used instruments; during disposal of used needles; and whenhandling sharp instruments after procedures. To prevent needlestick injuries,needles should not be recapped, purposely bent or broken by hand, removedfrom disposable syringes, or otherwise manipulated by hand. After they areused, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp itemsshould be placed in puncture-resistant containers for disposal; the puncture-resistant containers should be located as close as practical to the use area.Large-bore reusable needles should be placed in a puncture-resistant containerfor transport to the reprocessing area.4. Although saliva has not been implicated in HIV transmission, to minimize theneed for emergency mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, mouthpieces, resuscitationbags, or other ventilation devices should be available for use in areas in whichthe need for resuscitation is predictable.5. Health-care workers who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shouldrefrain from all direct patient care id from handling patient-care equipmentuntil the condition resolves.6. Pregnant health-care workers are not known to be at greater risk of contractingHIV infection than health-care workers who are not pregnant; however, if ahealth-care worker develops HIV infection during pregnancy, the infant is at riskof infection resulting from peril -ital transmission. Because of this risk, pregnanthealth-care workers should L especially familiar with and strictly adhere toprecautions to minimize the risk of HIV transmission.Implementation of universal blood and body-fluid precautions for all patientseliminates the need for use of the isolation category of \"Blood and Body FluidPrecautions\" previously recommended by CDC ( 7 ) for patients known or suspected to be infected withblood-borne pathogens. Isolation precautions (e.g.,enteric,\"APB\" [71) should be used as necessary if associated conditions, such as infectiousdiarrhea or tuberculosis, are diagnosed or suspected.Precautions for Invasive ProceduresIn this document, an invasive procedure is defined as surgical entry into tissues,cavities, or organs or repair of major traumatic injuries 1) in an operating or delivery 228 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 36 / No. 2S MMWR 7S room, emergency department, or outpatient setting, including both physicians' anddentists' offices; 2) cardiac catheterization and angiographic procedures; 3) a vaginalor cesarean delivery or other invasive obstetric procedure during which bleeding mayoccur; or 4) the manipulation, cutting, or removal of any oral or perioral tissues,including tooth structure, during which bleeding occurs or the potential for bleedingexists. The universal blood and body-fluid precautions listed above, combined withthe precautions listed below, should be the minimum precautions for all suchinvasive procedures.1. All health-care workers who participate in invasive procedures must routinelyuse appropriate barrier precautions to prevent skin and mucousmembranecontact with blood and other body fluids of all patients. Gloves and surgicalmasks must be worn for all invasive procedures. Protective eyewear or faceshields should be worn for procedures that commonly result in the generationof droplets, splashing of blood or other body fluids, or the generation of bonechips. Gowns or aprons made of materials that provide an effective barriershould be worn during invasive procedures that are likely to result in thesplashing of blood or other body fluids. All health-care workers who perform orassist in vaginal or cesarean deliveries should wear gloves and gowns whenhandling the placenta or the infant until blood and amniotic fluid have beenremoved from the infant's skin and should wear gloves during post-deliverycare of the umbilical cord.2. If a glove is torn or a needlestick or other injury occurs, the glove should beremoved and a new glove used as promptly as patient safety permits; theneedle or instrument involved in the incident should also be removed from thesterile field.Precautions for Dentistry*Blood, saliva, and gingival fluid from all dental patients should be consideredinfective. Special emphasis should be placed on the following precautions forpreventing transmission of blood-borne pathogens in dental practice in both institu-tional and non-institutional settings.1. In addition to wearing gloves for contact with oral mucous membranes of allpatients, all dental workers should wear surgical masks and protective eyewearor chin-length plastic face shields during dental procedures in which splashingor spattering of blood, saliva, or gingival fluids is likely. Rubber dams, high-speed evacuation, and proper patient positioning, when appropriate, should beutilized to minimize generation of droplets and spatter.2. Handpieces should be sterilized after use with each patient, since blood, saliva,or gingival fluid of patients may be aspirated into the handpiece or waterline.Handpieces that cannot be sterilized should at least be flushed, the outsidesurface cleaned and wiped with a suitable chemical germicide, and then rinsed.Handpieces should be flushed at the beginning of the day and after use witheach patient. Manufacturers' recommendations should be followed for use andmaintenance of waterlines and check valves and for flushing of handpieces. Thesame precautions should be used for ultrasonic scalers and air/water syringes.`General infection-control precautions are more specifically addressed in previous recommen-dations for infection-control practices for dentistry (8 ). Appendix E 229 MMWR August 21, 1987 3.Blood and saliva should be thoroughly and carefully cleaned from material thathas been used in the mouth (e.g., impression materials, bite registration),especially before polishing and grinding intra-oral devices. Contaminatedmaterials, impressions, and intra-oral devices should also be cleaned and disinfected before being handled in the dental laboratory and before they are placed in the patient's mouth. Because of the increasing variety of dentalmaterials used intra-orally, dental workers should consult with manufacturersas to the stability of specific materials when using disinfection procedures.4. Dental equipment and surfaces that are difficult to disinfect (e.g., light handlesor X-ray-unit heads) and that may become contaminated should be wrappedwith impervious-backed paper, aluminum foil, or clear plastic wrap. Thecoverings should be removed and discarded, and clean coverings should be put in place after use with each patient.Precautions for Autopsies or Morticians' ServicesIn addition to the universal blood and body-fluid precautions listed above, thefollowingprecautions shouldbe used by persons performing postmortemprocedures:1. All persons performing or assisting in postmortem procedures should weargloves, masks, protective eyewear, gowns, and waterproof aprons.2. Instruments andsurfacescontaminated during postmortem procedures shouldbe decontaminated with an appropriate chemical germicide.Precautions for DialysisPatients with end-stage renal disease who are undergoing maintenance dialysisand who have HIV infection can be dialyzed in hospital-based or free-standing dialysisunits using conventional infection-control precautions (21 ). Universal blood andbody-fluid precautions should be used when dialyzing all patients.Strategies for disinfecting the dialysis fluid pathways of the hemodialysis machineare targeted to control bacterial contamination and generally consist of using 500-750parts per million (ppm) of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) for 30-40 minutesor 1.5%-2.0% formaldehyde overnight. In addition, several chemical germicidesformulated to disinfect dialysis machines are commercially available. None of theseprotocols or procedures need to be changed for dialyzing patients infected with HIV.Patients infected with HIV can be dialyzed by either hemodialysis or peritonealdialysis and do not need to b isolated frqm other patients. The type of dialysistreatment (i.e., hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) should be based on the needs ofthe patient. The dialyzer may be discarded after each use. Alternatively, centers thatreuse dialyzersi.e., a specific single-use dialyzer is issued to a specific patient,removed, cleaned, disinfected, and reused several times on the same patient onlymay include HIV-infected patients in the dialyzer-reuse program. An individualdialyzer must never be used on more than one patient.Precautions for LaboratoriestBlood and other body fluids from all patients should be considered infective. Tosupplement the universal blood and body-fluid precautions listed above, the follow-ing precautions are recommended for health-care workers in clinical laboratories.'Additional precautions for research and industrial laboratories are addressed elsewhere(22.23 ). 230 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 36 / No. 2S MMWR 9S 1. All specimens of blood and body fluids should be put in a well-constructedcontainer with a secure lid to prevent leaking during transport. Care should betaken when collecting each specimen to avoid contaminating the outside of thecontainer and of the laboratory form accompanying the specimen.2. All persons processing blood and body-fluid specimens (e.g., removing topsfrom vacuum tubes) should wear gloves. Masks and protective eyewear shouldbe worn if mucous-membrane contact with blood or body fluids is anticipated.Gloves should be changed and hands washed after completion of specimenprocessing.3. For routine procedures, such as histologic and pathologic studies or microbio-logic culturing, a biological safety cabinet is not necessary. However, biologicalsafety cabinets (Class I or II) should be used whenever procedures are con-ducted that have a high potential for generating droplets. These includeactivities such as blending, sonicating, and vigorous mixing.4. Mechanical pipetting devices should be used for manipulating all liquids in thelaboratory. Mouth pipetting must not be done.5. Use of needles and syringes should be limited to situations in which there is noalternative, and the recommendations for preventing injuries with needlesoutlined under universal precautions should be followed.6. Laboratory work surfaces should be decontaminated with an appropriatechemical germicide after a spill of blood or other body fluids and when workactivities era completed.7. Contaminated materials used in laboratory tests should be decontaminatedbefore reprocessing or be placed in bags and disposed of in accordance withinstitutional policies for disposal of infective waste (24 ).8. Scientific equipment that has been contaminated with blood ur other bodyfluids should be decontaminated and cleaned before being repaired in thelaboratory or transported to the manufacturer.9. All persons should wash their hands after completing laboratory activities andshould remove protective clothing before leaving the laboratory.Implementation of universal blood and body-fluid precautions for all patientseliminates the need for warning labels on specimens since blood and other bodyfluids from all patients should be considered infective. Environmental Considerations for HIV TransmissionNo environmentally mediated mode of HIV transmission has been documented.Nevertheless, the precautions described below should be taken routinely in the careof all patients.Sterilization and DisinfectionStandard sterilization and disinfection procedures for patient-care equipmentcurrently recommended for use (25,26) in a variety of health-care settingsincludinghospitals, medical and dental clinics and offices, hemodialysis centers, emergency-care facilities, and long-term nursing-care facilitiesare adequate to sterilize ordisinfect instruments, devices, or other items contaminated with blood or other bodyfluids from p^rsons infected with blood-borne pathogens including HIV (21,23 ). Appendix E 231 10S MMWR August 21, 1987 Instruments or devices that enter sterile tissue or the vascular system of anypatient or through which blood flows should be sterilized befo--, reuse. Devices oritems that contact intact mucous membranes should be sterilized or receive high-level disinfection, a procedure that kills vegetative organisms and viruses but notnecessarily large numbers of bacterial spores. Chemical germicides that are regis-tered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as \"sterilants\" may beused either for sterilization or for high-level disinfection depending on contact time.Contact lenses used in trial fittings should be disinfected after each fitting by usinga hydrogen peroxide contact lens disinfecting system or, if compatible, with heat(78 C-80 C [172.4 F-176.0 Fp for 10 minutes.Medical devices or instruments that require sterilization or disinfection should bethoroughly cleaned before being exposed to the germicide, and the manufacturer'sinstructions for the use of the germicide should be followed. Further, it is importantthat the manufacturer's specifications for compatibility of the medical device withchemical germicides be closely followed. Information on specific label claims ofcommercial germicides can be obtained by writing to the Disinfectants Branch, Officeof Pesticides, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C.20460.Studies have shown that HIV is inactivated rapidly after being exposed tocommonly used chemical germicides at concentrations that are much lower thanused in practice (27-30). Embalming fluids are similar, to the types of chemicalgermicides that have been tested and found to completely inactivate HIV. In additionto commercially available chemical germicides, a solution of sodium hypochlorite(household bleach) prepared daily is an inexpensive and effective germicide. Con-centrations ranging from approximately 500 ppm dilution of household bleach) areeffective depending on the amount of organic material (e.g., blood, mucus) presenton the surface to be cleaned and disinfected. Commercially available chemicalgermicides may be more compatible with certain medical devices that might becorroded by repeated exposure to sodium hypochlorite, especially to the 1:10dilution.Survival of HIV h the EnvironmentThe most extensive study on the survival of HIV after drying involved greatlyconcentrated HIV samples, i.e., 10 million tissue-culture infectious doses permillilite,r (31 ). This concentration is at least 100,000 times greater than that typicallyfound in the blood or serum of patients with HIV infection. HIV was detectable bytissue-culture techniques 1-3 days after drying, but the rate of inactivation was rapid.Studies performed at CDC have also shown that drying HIV causes a rapid (withinseveral hours) 1-2 log (90%-99%) reduction in HIV concentration. In tissue-culturefluid, cell-free HIV could be detected up to 15 days at room temperature, up to 11 daysat 37 C (98.6 F), and up to 1 day if the HIV was cell-associated.When considered in the context of environmental conditions in health-carefacilities, these results do not require any changes in currently recommendedsterilization, disinfection, or housekeeping strategies. When medical devices arecontaminated with blood or other body fluids, existing recommendations include thecleaning of these instruments, followed by disinfection or sterilization, depending onthe type of medical device. These protocols assume \"worst-case\" conditions of 232 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 35 / No. 2S MMWR 11S extreme virologic and microbiologic contamination, and whether viruses have beeninactivated after drying plays no role in formulating these strategies. Consequently,no changes in published procedures for cleaning, disinfecting, or sterilizing need tobe made.HousekeepingEnvironmental surfaces such as walls, floors, and other surfaces are not associatedwith transmission of infections to patients or health-care workers. Therefore, extra-ordinary attempts to disinfect or sterilize these environmental surfaces are notnecessary. However, cleaning and removal of soil should be done routinely.Cleaning schedules and methods vary according to the area of the hospital orinstitution, type of surface to be cleaned, and the amount and type of soil present.Horizontal surfaces (e.g., bedside tables and hard-surfaced flooring) in patient-careareas are usually cleaned on a regular basis, when soiling or spills occur, and whena patient is discharged. Cleaning of walls, blinds, and curtains is recommended onlyif they are visibly soiled. Disinfectant fogging is an unsatisfactory method ofdecontaminating air and surfaces and is not recommended.Disinfectant-detergent formulations registerer; by EPA can be used for cleaningenvironmental surfaces, but the actual physL:al removal of microorganisms byscrubbing is probably at least as important as any antimicrobial effect of the cleaningagent used. Therefore, cost, safety, and acceptability by housekeepers can be themain criteria for selecting any such registered agent. The manufacturers' inst:uctionsfor appropriate use should be followed.Cleaning and Decontaminating Spills of Wood or Other Body FluidsChemical germicides that are approved for use as \"hospital disinfectants\" and aretuberculocidal when used at recommended dilutions can be used to decontaminatespills of blood and other body fluids. Strategies for decontaminating spills of bloodand other body fluids in a patient-care setting are different than for spills of culturesor other materials in clinical, public health, or research laboratories. In patient-careareas, visible material should first be removed and then the area should bedecontaminated. With large spills of cultured or concentrated infectious agents in thelaboratory, the contaminated area should be flooded with a liquid germicide beforecleaning, then decontaminated with fresh germicidal chemical. In both settings,gloves should be worn during the cleaning and decontaminating procedures.LaundryAlthough soiled linen has been identified as a source of large numbers of certainpathogenic microorganisms, the risk of actual disease transmission is negligible.Rather than rigid procedures and specifications, hygienic and common-sense storageand processing of clean and soiled linen are recommended (26 ). Soiled linen shouldbe handled as little as possible and with minimum agitation to prevent grossmicrobial contamination of the air and of persons handling the linen. All soiled linenshould be bagged at the location where it was used; it should not be sorted or rinsedin patient-care areas. Linen soiled with blood or body fluids should be placed andtransported in bags that prevent leakage. If hot water is used, linen should be washed 22,c,Appendix E 233 12S MMWR August 21, 1987 with detergent in water at least 71 C (160 F) for 25 minutes. If low - temperature( 70 C(158 Fl) laundry cycles are used, chemicals suitable for low-temperature washing atproper use concentration should be used.Infective WasteThere is no epidemiologic evidence to suggest that most hospital waste is anymore infective than residential waste. Moreover, there is no epidemiologic evidencethat hospital waste has caused disease in the community as a result of improperdisposal. Therefore, identifying wastes for which special precautions are indicated islargely a matter of judgment about the relative risk of disease transmission. The mostpractical approach to the management of infective waste is to identify those wasteswith the potential for causing infection during handling and disposal and for whichsome special precautions appear prudent. Hospital wastes for which special precau-tions appear prudent include microbiology laboratory waste, pathology waste, andblood specimens or blood products. While any item that has had contact with blood,exudates, or secretions may be potentially infective, it is not usually consideredpractical or necessary to treat all such waste as infective (23,26). Infective waste, ingeneral, should either be incinerated or should be autoclaved before disposal in asanitary landfill. Bulk blood, suctioned fluids, excretions, and secretions may becarefully poured down a drain connected to a sanitary sewer. Sanitary sewers mayalso be used to dispose of other infectious wastes capable of being ground andflushed into the sewer. Implementation of Recommended PrecautionsEmployers of health-care workers should ensure that policies exist for:1. Initial orientation and continuing education and training of all health-careworkersincluding students and traineeson the epidemiology, modes oftransmission, and preventionof HIV and other blood-borne infections and theneed for routine use of universal blood and body-fluid precautions for allpatients.2. Provision of equipment and supplies necessary to minimize the risk of infectionwith HIV and other blood-borne pathogens.3. Monitoring adherence to recommended protective measures. When monitoringreveals a failure to follow recommended precautions, counseling, education,and/or re-training should be provided, and, if necessary, appropriate discipli-nary action should be considered.Professional associatin is and labor organizations, through continuing educationefforts, should emphasize the need for health-care workers to follow recommendedprecautions. 234AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES r e-1,400 Vol. 36 No. 2S Mmwn 13S Serologic Testing for HIV InfectionBackgroundA person is identified as infected with HIV when a sequence of tests, starting withrepeated enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and including a Western blot or similar, morespecific assay, are repeatedly reactive. Persons infected with HIV usually developantibody against the virus within 6.12 weeks after infection.The sensitivity of the currently licensed EIA tests is at least 99% when they areperformed under optimal laboratory conditions on serum specimens from personsinfected for12 weeks. Optimal laboratory conditions include the use of reliablereagents, provision of continuing education of personnel, quality control of proce-dures, and participation in performance-evaluation programs. Given this perform-ance, the probability of a false-negative test is r:.mote except during the first severalweeks after infection, before detectable antitledy is present. The proportion ofinfected persons with a false-negative test attributed to absence of antibody in theearly stages of infection is dependent on both the incidence and prevalence of HIVinfection in a population (Table 1).The specificity of the currently licensed EIA tests is approximately 99% whenrepeatedly reactive tests are considered. Repeat testing of initially reactive specimensby EIA is required to reduce the likelihood of laboratory error. To increase further thespecificity of serologic tests, laboratories must use a supplemental test, most oftenthe Western blot, to validate repeatedly reactive EIA results. Under optimal laboratoryconditions, the sensitivity of the Western blot test is comparable to or greater thanthat of a repeatedly reactive EIA, and the Western blot is highly specific when strictcriteria are used to interpret the test results. The testing sequence of a repeatedlyreactive EIA and a positive Western blot test is highly predictive of HIV infection, evenin a population with a low prevalence of infection (Table 2). If the Western blot testresult is indeterminant, the testing sequence is considered equivocal for HIV infection.TABLE 1. Estimated annual number of patients infected with HIV not detected byHIV-antibody testing in a hypothetical hospital estimates are based on the following assumptions: 1) the sensitivity of the screening testis 99% (i.e., 99% of HIV-infected persons with antibody will be detected); 2) persons infected withHIV will not develop detectable antibody (seroconvert) until 6 weeks (1.5 months) after infection;3) new infections occur at an equal rate throughout the year; 4) calculations of the number ofHIV-infected persons in the patient population are based on the mid-year prevalence, which isthe beginning prevalence plus half the annual incidence of infections. 231Appendix E 235 14S MMWR August 21, 1987 When this occurs, the Western blot test should be repeated on the same serumsample, and, if still indeterminant, the testing sequence should be repeated on asample collected 3.6 months later. Use of other supplemental tests may aid ininterpreting of results on samples that are persistently indeterminant by Western blot.Testing of PatientsPrevious CDC recommendations have emphasized the value of HIV serologictesting of patients for: 1) management of parenteral or mucous-membrane exposuresof health-care workers, 2) patient diagnosis and management, and 3) counseling andserologic testing to prevent and control HIV transmission in the community. Inaddition, more recent recommendations have statod that hospitals, in conjunctionwith state and local health departments, should periodically determine the prevalenceof HIV infection among patients from age groups at highest risk of infection (32 ).Adherence to universal blood and body-fluid precautions recommended for thecare of all patients will minimize the risk of transmission of HW and other bloodbornepathogens from patients to health-care workers. The utility of routine HIV serologictesting of patients as an adjunct to universal precautions is unknown. Results of suchtesting may not be available in emergency or outpatient settings. In addition, somerecently infected patients will not have detectable antibody to HIV (Table 1).Personnel in some hospitals have advocated serologic testing of patients insettings in which exposure of health-care workers to large amounts of patients' bloodmay be anticipated. Specific patients for whom serologic testing has been advocatedinclude those undergoing major operative procedures and those undergoing treat-ment in critical care units, especially if they have conditions involving uncontrolledbleeding. Decisions regarding the need to establish testing programs for patientsshould be made by physicians or individual institutions. in addition, when deemedappropriate, testing of individual patients may be performed on agreement betweenthe patient and the physician providing care.In addition to the universal precautions recommended for all patients, certainadditional precautions for the care of HIV-infected patients undergoing major surgicaloperations have been proposed by personnel in some hospitals. For example,surgical procedures on an HIVinfected patient might be altered so that hand-to-handpassing of sharp instruments would be eliminated; stapling instruments rather thanTABLE 2. Predictive value of positive HIV-antibody tests in hypothetical populationswith different prevalences of persons with positive test results who are actually infected with HIV.tAssumes EIA sensitivity of 99.0% and specificity of S9.5%.tAssumes WB sensitivity of99.0% and specificity of 99.9 %. 236 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 36 / No. 2S MMWR 15S hand-suturing equipment might be used to perform tissue approximation; electro-cautery devices rather than scalpels might be used as cutting instruments and, eventhough uncomfortable, gowns that totally prevent seepage of blood onto the skin ofmembers of the operative team might be worn. While such modifications mightfurther minimize the risk of HIV infection for members of the operative team, some ofthese techniques could result in prolongation of operative time and could potentiallyhave an adverse effect on the patient.Testing programs, if developed, should include f:ie following principles:Obtaining consent for testing.Informing patients of test results, and providing counseling for sero positivepatients by properly trained persons.Assuring that confidentiality safeguards ;ire in place to limit knowledge of testresults to those directly involved in the care of infected patients or as requiredby law.Assuring that identification of infected patients will not result in denial ofneeded care or provision of suboptimal care.Evaluating prospectively 1) the efficacy of the program in reducing the inci-dence of parenteral, mucous-membrane, or significant cutaneous exposures ofhealth-care workers to the blood or other body fluids of HIV-infected patientsand 2) the effect of modified procedures on patients.Testing of Health-Care WorkersAlthough transmission of HIV from infected health-care workers to patients has notbeen reported, transmission during invasive procedures remains a possibility. Trans-mission of hepatitis B virus (HBV)a blood-borne agent with a considerably greaterpotential for nosocomial spreadfrom health-care workers to patients has beendocumented. Such transmission has occurred in situations (e.g., oral and gynecologicsurgery) in which health-care workers, when tested, had very high concentrations ofHBV in their blood (at least 100 million infectious virus particles per milliliter, aconcentration much higher than occurs with HIV infection), and the health-careworkers sustained a puncture wound while performing invasive procedures or hadexudative or weeping lesions or microlacerations that allowed virus to contaminateinstruments or open wounds of patients (33,34 ).The hepatitis B experience indicates that only those health-care workers whoperform certain types of invasive procedures have transmitted HBV to patients.Adherence to recommendations in this document will minimize the risk of transmis-sion of HIV and other blood-borne pathogens from health-care workers to patientsduring invasive procedures. Since transmission of HIV from infected health-careworkers performing invasive procedures to their patients has not been reported andwould be expected to occur only very rarely, if at all, the utility of routine testing ofsuch health-care workers to prevent transmission of HIV cannot be assessed. Ifconsideration is given to developing a serologic r program for health-careworkers who perform invasive procedures, the freq..-o ty of testing, as well as theissues of consent, confidentiality, and consequences o, test resultsas previouslyoutlined for testing programs for patientsmust be ad ressed. 2t33 Appendix E 237 16S MMWR August 21, 1987 Management of Infected Health-Care WorkersHealth-care workers with impaired immune systems resulting from HIV infectionor other causes are at increased risk of acquiring or experiencing serious complica-tions of infectious disease. Of particular concern is the risk of severe infectionfollowing exposure to patients with infectious diseases that are easily transmitted ifappropriate precautions are not taken (e.g., measles, varicella). Any health-careworker with an impaired immune system should be counseled about the potential riskassociated with taking care of patients with any transmissible infection and shouldcontinue to follow existing recommendations for infection control to minimize risk ofexposure to other infectious agents (7,35). Recommendations of the ImmunizationPractices Advisory Committee (ACIP) and institutional policies concerning require-ments for vaccinating health-care workers with live-virus vaccines (e.g., measles,rubella) should also be considered.The question of whether workers infected with HIV especially those who performinvasive procedurescan adequately and safely be allowed to perform patient-careduties or whether their work assignments should be changed must be determined onan individual basis. These decisions should be made by the health-care worker'spersonal physician (s) in conjunction with the medical directors and personnel healthservice staff of the employing institution or hospital. Management of ExposuresIf a health-care worker has a parenteral (e.g., needlestick or cut) or mucous-membrane (e.g., splash to the eye cr mouth) exposure to blood or other body fluidsor has a cutaneous exposure involving large amounts of blood or prolonged contactwith bloodespecially when the exposed skin is chapped, abraded, or afflicted withdermatitisthe source patient should be informed of the incident and tested forserologic evidence of HIV infection after consent is obtained. Policies should bedeveloped for testing source patients in situations in which consent cannot beobtained (e.g., an unconscious patient).If the source patient has AIDS, is positive for HIV antibody, or refuses the test, thehealth-care worker should be counseled regarding the risk of infection and evaluatedclinically and serologically for evidence of HIV infection as soon as possible after theexposure. The health-care worker should be advised to report and seek medicalevaluation for any acute febrile illness that occurs within 12 weeks after the exposure.Such an illnessparticularly one characterized by fever, rash, or lymphadenopathymay be indicative of recent HIV infection. Seronegative health-care workers should beretested 6 weeks post-exposure and on a periodic basis thereafter (e.g., 12 weeks and6 months after exposure) to determine whether transmission has occurred. Duringthis follow-up periodespecially the first 6.12 weeks after exposure, when mostinfected persons are expected to seroconvert exposed health-care workers shouldfollow U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) recommendations for preventing transmis-sion of HIV (36,37 ).No further follow-up of a health-care worker exposed to infection as describedabove is necessary if the source patient is seronegative unless the source patient is athigh risk of HIV infection. In the latter case, a subsequent specimen (e.g., 12 weeksfollowing exposure) may be obtained from the health-care worker for antibody 238AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES Vol. 36 / No. 2S MMWR 17S testing. If the source patient cannot be identified, decisions regarding appropriatefollow-up should be individualized. Serologic testing should be available to allhealth-care workers who are concerned that they may have been infected with HIV.If a patient has a parenteral or mucousmembrane exposure to blood or other bodyfluid of a health-care worker, the patient should be informed of the incident, any tnesa:ne procedure outlined above for management of exposures should be followed forboth the source health-care worker and the exposed patient.References1.

Itdoesnotaddresstreatment,anddoesnotcontaineducationmaterial beyond definitions of terminology and other essentials.Once HIV infection occurs, the individual is considered, forpublichealthpurposes,tobeinfectedandcapableoftransmitting the virustoothersbyspecific mechanisms, forlife.HIVinfectionmayseverelydamagetheimmunesystem,allowing usually rare cancers to occur and/or allowing usuallyharmlessmicroorganisms tocauselifethreateninginfections(either of these constitutes AIDS), or it may cause less seriousillness(sometimescalledAIDS-relatedconditionorcomplex,\"ARC\"),orit may cause no detectable illness at all. Itisroughly estimated that for every case of AIDS in the USA, thereare ten cases of \"ARC\" (less serious illness) and as many as onehundred apparently healthy HIV infected persons. Several yearsmayintervenebetweenHIVinfectionandtheappearanceofillness;if it occurs, illness may or may not progress to a moreserious category. If the HIV damages the immune system severelyenough to cause AIDS, the cancer or life-threatening infections,though usually treatable, continue to occur or recur, and adultswith AIDS usually die within several years.All HIV infected persons, regardless of whether or not theyareill,canpotentiallytransmitthevirus,notbycasualcontact, but by specific behaviors or mechanisms. These includesharing of blood or blood-contaminated sharp instruments (usually -4 24, Appendix G 255 needles),sharingofsemenandpossiblyotherbodyfluids (usually during sexual activity), and transmission through the birth process, to infants. In the USA, homosexual or bisexual men and IV drug users have accounted for about 90% of AIDS cases. Over the past several years, a constant proportion of AIDS cases has occurred among persons with no known risk factors, a category whichalsoincludespersonswhocouldnotorwouldnotbe interviewed regarding risk factors. Concerns about airborne, waterborne, insect vector and casual contact spread have not been substantiated, since such spread would result in an increase in the \"no risk factor\" category, which has not occurred. Moreover, carefulstudiesofhealthcareworkerswhohavecaredfor patients with AIDS, and of household contact's of patients with AIDS, have disclosed no evidence of spread by casual contact.At present, no test which actually detects the HIV in the body orbloodiswidely available. However,nearly allHIV infectedpersonseventuallyreacttoinfectionbyproducing specificbloodproteinscalledantibodies.Theseantibodies react with parts of the virus and can be detected in the blood. A very reliable series of tests for HIV antibodies iswidely available.Antibody-po.-Ative personsareconsideredinfected with the HIV, and,therefore,are also considered potentially infectious if they engage in the behaviors mentioned above.II.DEVELOPMENT OF A DATA BASEThe spread ofHIV infection among prisoners requires the presence ofinfected prisoners and requires specific high-risk behaviorsinvolvinginfectedanduninfectedprisoners.For practical purposes, this means IV drug use with shared injection equipmentorunsafemalehomosexualactivity.Thoughthese activities do occur in prison, their frequency is not known, nor is the prevalence of HIV infection among MDOC prisoners known. Data on high-risk behaviors and on the prevalence of infection arepotentially useful indetermining ifchangesinprisoner management are needed, inassessing theimpact of educational programs, and in predicting costs and other impact of management options.The BHCS will work with the Michigan Department of Public Health tostudy,onan ongoing basis, the prevalence of HIV infection in newly committed MDOC prisoners. This will consist ofanonymoustestingforHIVantibodiesinbloodspecimens alreadybeingobtainedforReceptionCenterprocessingina sample ofnewlycommitted prisoners. Such specimens will be testedonlyaftercompletionof tests for which the blood was 256 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES r44,- MIN actually drawn and after removal of identifying information, sothat no additional blood will be drawn and no HIV antibody resultwillbe linked to any individual .pn,isoner. This study will beconducted for an appropriate period and repeated at appropriateintervalstoyieldreliabledataontheprevalenceofHIVantibodypositivityamongnewlycommittedprisoners.Data collection shall begin within 60 days and bereported totheDirector within six months.The BHCS will consult and work with the Mic)...gan DepartmentofPublicHealth(MDPH)andwithacademicinstitutionswithexpertiseinpublichealthtodesignmethodstostudythefrequencyof high-riskbehaviors such as IV needle sharing andunsafe male homosexual activity among prisoners, as well es tostudy prisoners' knowledge of mechanisms of HIV spread.The Deputy Director for the BHCS will report to the MDPH onaquarterlybasisinformation onHIVinfection inMDOCprisoners, including numbers of cases of AIDS, other HIV-relatedillness, andapparentiy healthy HIV infection. The format ofsuch reports will be jointly developed by the BHCS and the MDPH.III.SCREENING, COUNSELING. AND EDUCATIONNo treatment which eradicates HIV infection is available, novaccine to prevent infection with HIV is available. anu infectedpersons usually are not ill and do not have any distinguishingcharacteristics. Thuseducation,particularlyofmembersofhigh- risk groups, regarding how to avoid infection is the bestpractical and available tool to reduce and eliminate HIV-relateddisease.As the average sentence for MDOC prisoners is less thanthree years, effective educational efforts could have benefit farbeyond incarceration.The Public Health Service now recommends voluntary, informedHIV antibody testing of high-risk group members as an adjunct tocounseling of such individuals. The MDOC policy regarding HIVantibody testing is as follows. There will be no mass testing ofemployeesorprisoners(otherthantheperiodicanonymousReception Center sampling described above). The HIV antibodytestwillbe ordered only byaphysician,orbyephysicianassistant with specific delegated authority from the supervisingphysician.The test willbe performedat the request of theprisoner, or may besuggestedbythephysician/physicianassistant based upon the prisoner's membership in a risk group,possible exposure, or symptoms or signs suggestiveofHIVinfection.Nomorethan one test per six month period will be 2 5 1 Appendix G 257 done solely at the request of the prisoner,but nolimitis placed on the frequency of clinically appropriate tests. In allcases, pre-test and post-test counseling must be done (the BHCSwilldistribute appropriate up-to-date written materialtobeused in counseling), and the counseling must be documented in thehealth record. The prisoner's consent to testing must also bedocumentedinthehealthrecordbythephysician/physicianassistant.Educationaleffortsmustutilizeeffectivemethodsandmaterials.TheBHCSwillworkwiththeTrainingDivision periodicallytoevaluateandupdateaudioyisualand written teachingmaterialsregardingHIVinfectionsuitablefor institutional andfieldservicestaff,incorporating such materialinto new employee training programs and into current employee retraining and update programs. Audiovisual and writtenmaterials suitable for prisoners shall similarly be evaluated andupdated.Materialsprepared outside the MDOC may havemore credibility than those prepared by the Department. Material forprisoners must explicitly address and emphasize the danger of IVdrug use with shared injection equipment and of unsafe sexualactivity.Materials identified by this cooperative effort willbesharedwithlawenforcementagencieswhichoperatecorrectional facilities via the Office of Facility Services, andinterested groups of law enforcement personnel.ReceptionCenterprocessingisoneopportunitytouse existing Department structure toexposeincoming prisoners to educational material regarding their health. The BHCS will work with Bureau of Correctional Facilities Reception Center staff to exposeeach incomingprisonertowritten,andifpossible, audiovisual educational material developed by the BHCS/TrainingDivisioncooperativeeffort.OnceprisonershavecompletedReception Center processing and are transferred to institutions,this education program will berepeated during classificationorientation programs. TheBHCSwillrevise Reception Centerhealth screening procedures and forms to improve the likelihoodthat prisoners with, or at risk of, HIV infection are identified,counseled and offered voluntary informed HIV antibody testing (asoutlined above), and that those who have HIV-related illness arepromptly identified and treated.Because one risk group, IV drug users, is overrepresented incorrectional facilities, the Department has a unique opportunityto inform this group. The concern about HIV infe-tion, as wellas the availability of adjuncts to abstinence such as an oral,longacting,non-addictingnarcoticantagonist,providean opportunitytodevelopeffectivetreatmentprograms for some 258 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES 0 :.....4 ;1 , narcotic users, especially during correction center BureauofField Services (BFS),BHCS and otherappropriateDepartmententitieswithworkwiththeMDPHtoexploreoptions,includingfunding,forutilizationofsuchtreatment and counseling programs.Each institution will assign an employee, selected by themedical director and preferably a member of the medical staff, towork with the institution Training Committee as a resource personfor AIDS information at that facility. This individual will beresponsible for being well iniormed regarding the epidemiology ofHIVinfection,regardingMDOCpolicyinthisarea, and forinvolvingtheTrainingCommitteeineduca'tionalactivities.Appropriate activities for the resource person and the TrainingCommitteeinclude,whereapplicable,conductinginserviceprograms for health care, transportation, laundry, food serviceandotherconcernedstaff,addressing the Warden's Forum andother prisoner organizations, providing informational materialfor the institution newspaper, posting informational posters, andothersuchactivitiesutilizingtheeducationalmaterialsdeveloped by the BHCS/Training Division cooperative effort. Toensurethatan active educational program is ongoing at eachfacility,andthat particularly effective or useful educationactivities are shared throughout the Department, this resourceperson willreport quarterly to the Deputy Director for BHCS,outlining activities of the previous three months.The BHCS will organize and conduct, in cooperation with theTraining Division, ongoinginserviceeducationprogramsforhealth care staff to ensure that such staff in all disciplinesarewellinformedregarding prevention ofHIVinfectionanddetection and treatment of those infected.The Bureau ofField Services will work with the trainingDivision and the BHCS to disseminate rapidly and efficiently theeducationalmaterialdevelopedforstafftoBFSpersonnel,particularlythoseinurbancenters,wheresupervisionofsignificant numbers of offenders in corrections centers and onparole will occur. BFS staff will also be given this informationas part of training update programs. IV.GENERAL PRECAUTIONS TO PREVENT TRANSMISSION OFINFECTIONPrudentpracticesandprecautions topreventthetransmission of blood-borne infections such as HIV should alwaysbe usual and routine for staff and prisoners. Because only asmallfractionofthoseinfectedwiththeHIVknow of the Appendix G 259 infection or are known to others as infected, or are ill, itismorerationaltotakeprecautionsallofthetimethantoconstruct and rely upon intricate notification or identificationprocedures regarding those who are-known to be infected.Prisoners exhibiting violent or threatening behavior shouldbepresumedtobeinfected,and shouldbemanagedsoastominimizethepotentialforexposuretoblood.Sharpitemspossessed by or in contact with prisoners or any person should behandled with extraordinary care to prevent accidental injuries.Handsorotherbodypartsshouldbewashedimmediatelyandthoroughly ifincontact with blood. Clov,esshouldbewornbefore handling or cleaning up blood or other body fluids, eitherdirectly or on clothing or other items. Though mouth to mouthbreathing has not been implicated in transmission of the HIV, it is prudent to have CPR masks (and gloves) immediately availablein allareas serving prisoners, and carried by escort staff inareas where such supplies are not immediately available.Existinginstitutionallaundry and dishwashing proceduresare adequate to decontaminate linens, clothing, dishes, trays andotherreusablemealutensils.Whencleaningenvironmentalsurfaces,commonlyused housekeeping procedures areadequate.Surfaces exposed to blood or other body fluids should be cleanedusing gloves,soap and water or household detergent and thenwiped with an EPA-approved disinfectant or afreshly preparedsolution of houshold bleach (one half cup of bleach gallon ofwateris adequate). Plastic bagsmay beused totransportgrosslycontaminateditemsfordisposalassolidwaste,andsoluble(dissolvable)bags shallbeusedtotransport grosslycontaminated laundry and placed directly into the washer.Bloodandsecretion(bodyfluid)precautionswill,therefore, be a routine, rather than an exceptional practice. Inunusualcircumstances, transportofprisoner-\u00b0knowntohavebleeding,drainingwoundsorsores,infectiousdiarrheaorinfectious respiratory illness will meritareminder regardingblood and secretion precautions or require specific additionalinfection control precautions on the part of escort staff. Eachinstitutionmedicaldirectorwillreviewand,ifnecessary,implementprocedurestoensurethatescortpersonnel(andpersonnel at the receiving facility) are notified of the need forsuch specific precautions. Unless necessary for health care,this does NOT require or authorize disclosure of the specificdiagnosis.The specific precautions needed (for example, bloodandsecretionfor hepatitis B or hepatitis non-Anon-B or HIV 260 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES infection,respiratorywithmasksforpulmonarytuberculosis,mumpsormeningococcal infection,etc.)should,however,beexplicitly described. V.MANAGEMENT OF BODY FLUID EXPOSURE INCIDENTSIf a cut, needlestick or other puncture, or mucous membrane(splash tothe eye or mouth) exposure to blpod or other bodyfluid occurs, the exposed area should,. if possible, be promptlycleansed. Aphysicianshouldbeconsultedconcerningthe likelihood of HIV infection (and, if applicable, the likelihoodofother blood-borne infectious diseases such as syphilis andhepatitis B) in the source of the blood or body fluid (if known)andconcerningthesignificance oftheexposure.Appropriateguidelines for evaluation of the source and exposed person are asfollows.Ifaphysicianjudgesthatti-e.exposurewas significant, andifthe source person isknown,that sourceperson should be asked to consent to appropriate epidemiologic,clinicalandserological(HIVantibodyandotherappropriatetests) evaluation. If the source person declines evaluation orhas AIDSorotherevidenceofHIVinfectionsuchastheantibody, the exposed person should beevaluated clinically she/he should beretested after sixweeksandonaperiodicbasisthereafter(e.g., three, six and twelve months after exposure) to determineiftransmission has occurred. Duringthisfollow-up period,especiallythefirstsixtotwelveweeks,whenmostnewlyinfected persons are expected to seroconvert toHIV antibody-positive status, the exposed person should receive counselingaboutinfectionandshouldtakeprecautions topreventtransmissionoftheHIV.Ifthesourcepersonisunknown,decisions regarding follow-up should be individualized based onthe type of exposure and the likelihood that the source personwas infected.All instances of such exposure shall be promptly reported tothe institution head and to the institution medical director (orin non-institution settings, to the office of the Deputy Directorfor BHCS).The medical director will implement the evaluationand counseling outlined above for prisoners, and employees willbe referred to the occupational physician. Each medical directorwill contact the institution's occupational physician to ensurethat both understand and agree on the appropriate management ofemployees who have had body fluid exposure. Necessary medicalinformation regarding the source of such exposures may be sharedwith the occupational physician by the medical director, but neednot and should not include identifying information. 53 Appendix G 261 VI.EMPLOYEES AND HIV INFECTIONHIVinfectioninanemployeeshallnotitselfbeaconsiderationin appointment, promotion, or other condition ofemployment, except that employees with HIV infection whose dutiesinvolveinvasiveprocedures(e.g.,surgery,dentalsurgery,phlebotomy)willberequiredtotakeappropriateextraprecautionswhenperformingsuchprocedures,andmayberestrictedfrom performing certain procedures. Acoexistentillnessorconditionmaybearelevantconsideration inappointment, promotion or other condition of employment, but onlyon its own merits. Itisthe policy of the MDOC that employees shall not beexcused from working with or caring for HIV infected prisoners orparolees,or from working with HIV infected employees, basedsolelyon theirownrequest.Employees who believe that theyareat high risk of HIV infection because of their own healthstatus, or who have concern because of pregnancy, should discusstheir work responsibilities with their personal physician. Ifthephysicianjudgestheassignmenttobehazardoustotheemployee, this information should be communicated in writing forappropriate action on a case by case basis.VII.HIVINFECTION IN PRISONERSAll cases of AIDS will be reported as required by law to theMichigan Department ofPublic Health through the localhealthdepartment.All cases of HIV infection in prisoners, regardlessofthepresenceofillness(includingapparentlyhealthyantibody-positivity, AIDS,andotherHIV-relatedillnessregardless of clinical classification) will be reported to theDeputy Director in charge of the Bureau of Health Care Serviceswithin two business days. This information isto be consideredconfidentialhealthrecordinformation. ThepresenceofHIVinfection in a prisoner does not alone constitute a threat to thesafety and security of the prisoner or the institution, and nodisclosure or request for disclosure of this specific informationshallbemadebasedonsuchapresumptionalone.Limiteddisclosure(e.g.thata particular prisoner has an unspecifiedblood-borne/sexually transmitteddiseaseagent)totheinstitutionheadforthepurposeofmanagingbehavior isdiscussed elsewhere inthisprotocol.Disclosuretocustodypersonnelforuseinprogram classification and disclosure onhealth clearance forms for transfer among MDOC institutions shallbe similarly limited and not name the specific disease or agent.Whenthehealthclearanceformisusedforinformational 262 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES p rposesandis notaccompaniedby the health record (suchaswhenitaccompanies the prisonertocourt,orisusedtoprovideinformationtotheBureau of Field Services staff toassistindeterminingCommunity1Programeligibility), moreexplicit information will be provided.Occasionally areport that a convicted person may have HIVinfection or related illness is appropriately included in a pre-sentence report. BFS staff who elect to include such data in apre-sentencereportshallcarefullyconsiderandexplicitlydocument the source of such information. MDOC institution staffshall treat this as confidential health record, information.If an HIV-infected prisoner has contacts who are clearly atrisk,that prisoner should beinformed oftheimportanceofnotifyingthosecontactswhoareknown.The notificationshould be done by the prisoner, orbydesignated Bureau ofHealthCareServicesstaffwiththewrittenconsentoftheprisoner. Iftheprisonerrefusestonotify,ortopermitdesignatedBureauofHealthCareServicesstafftonotifycontacts who are clearly at risk, Central Office Bureau of HealthCare Services staff shall consult with the appropriate healthofficerregardingoptionsforpropernotif4--,tion ofsuchcontacts.Housing assignments for prisoners with HIV infection will beconsistent with their security classification and medical needs.HIV-infected prisoners requiring intensive hospital care will beadmitted, as soon as circumstances permit, to the Department ofCorrectionsSecureUnit.Infectedprisonersrequiringlessintensive hospital care will be admitted to the Duane L. WatersHospital at the State Prison of Southern Michigan. HIV-infectedprisoners who do not require inpatient care will be eligible forgeneralpopulation housing atanyinstitution which canmeettheir health care and security needs, and will also be eligiblefor any programming and work assignment which their health andbehavior allows. ItisthegoaloftheMDOC toreducethefrequencyofprisonerbehaviorswhichmighttransmittheHIV,bothbyeducation regarding the health hazards of such behaviors, and bysurveillance and appropriate supervision. Occasionally, despitecounseling by health care staff and other educational efforts, aprisoner will continue behaviors which may transmit to others ortohimselforherselfablood-borne/sexually transmittableinfectiousagentsuchastheHIV,the hepatitis B virus, orotheragent.Thisbehaviormayoccurduetoalackof Appendix G 263 _.1 understanding or lack of capacity to understand the hazard, or a lack of concern for his or her own health. or that of others; but it represents a potential health hazard.The medical director and the institution head will consult promptly when either party discovers an infected prisoner or one engaged in high-risk behavior. The purpose of such consultation is outlined below. The medical director shall not disclose the specific diagnosis or infectious agent. Rather, the focus shall be on behaviors which need to be eliminated. Utilizing misconduct findings,criticalincidentreportsandotherappropriate sources, each institution head will assemble a list of prisonerswhosebehavior(intimatesexualactivity,substanceabusein which IV-needles maybeinvolved,orrepeated assaultiveness) might transmit blood-borne/sexually transmittedagents.This willpermitsuchbehaviortoreceivespecialattention, particularly if review of the health records of such prisoners by the medical director reveals evidence of infection. It will also permit such prisoners to be offered appropriate counselling and health screening. Concurrently, each institution medical director will maintain a secure list of prisoners at that facility who are known to be carriers of infectious agents, with special attention to blood-borne/sexually transmitted agents such as the HIV and the hepatitis B virus. This will permit review of the behavior of such prisoners by both the institution head and the medical director.Each institution head and medical director shall meet at least monthly to review the behavior of prisoners known to be infected, utilizing institution files, critical incident reports (and rarely health record data regarding behavior, which mny not be the solebasisfor disciplinary action) sothatinfected prisoners who are engaged in high-risk behaviors will have the behavior addressed. Increased surveillance of prisoners who are merelyinfected,butnot,knowntobeengagedinhigh-risk behavior,whilepotentiallyuseful,cariesthehazardof subjecting such prisoners to de facto widespread disclosure of their infection. Therefore, infected prisoners who are not known to be engaged in such behavior will not be subject to special or increased surveillance other than the monthly record review just described.The second task to be accomplished is that of reviewing the behavior of all prisoners believed to be engaging in high-risk behaviors.If such identified prisoners, even after counseling,continue to engage in high risk-behavior, the institution head willpromptly initiate such action as is appropriate to remove theopportunity for such behavior. Options for action will vary 264 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES depending upon the nature ofthe behavior and how well itisestablished that the behavior isoccurring,but mightincludechange in housing, programming, security classification or levelof surveillance or transfer to a faCility which can provide thenecessary supervision. Theleastrestrictive,but effective,action shallbe taken,and the decision shall be re-evaluatedevery three months at the facility where the prisoner is housed.Sincethebehavioristhefocusofsuchaction,nofurtherdisclosure of health information is to occur.

B.MMWR, November 5, 1982.C.MMWR, September 27, 1985.D.MMWR, March 28, 1986.E.Governor's AIDS Task Force Report.F.Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), April, 1986. II.Applicable to: All Employees and Inmates. 111.Purpose: The purpose of this policy and procedure is to reduce the risk of transmitting the etiological viral agent of AIDS in theMaryland Correctional System by:A.Making available to health care providers a description of AIDS including a case definition, risk factors and some clinical features.B.Establishing procedures for the identification and evaluation of persons sus- pected of having AIDS and AIDS related diseases.C.Implementing educational programs for staff and inmates. D.Implementing policies governing the management of individuals suspected of having AIDS. IV.Definitions: A.AIDS:a serious communicable disease which alters the body's immune system. Like patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, AIDS paci2nts are sus- ceptible to a number of opportunistic conditions.The Centers for Disease Control has defined AIDS as \"a reliably diagnosed disease that is at least moderately indicative of an underlying cellularimmunodeficiency or of increased susceptibility to that disease.\" Presence of HTLV-III antibody was included in the definition of AIDS - related diseases in June 1985 (MMWR, June 28, 1985). The conditions accepted by the CDC as evidence of AIDS and the appropriate diagnostic procedures for these conditions are listed in Attachme%t 1.B.Opportunistic Disease: diseases which occur only in persons with serious immune deficiency. Prior to the development of an opportunistic disease, AIDS patients may develop prodromal signs and symptoms including: fever, night sweats, chronic lyrnphadenopa hy, thrush, unexplained weight loss, chronic or recurrent diarrhea, non-productive cough, shortness of breath, and lymphopenia.Other non-specific symptoms such as malaise, usually occur '66 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES21PGOF6 DCR NO.130-11 but are not informative by themselves. (see Appendix 6) V.Policy: VI.Procedure: A.EducationIt is the policy of the Division of Correction that all in-mates and employees shall be provided appropriate educationand training to improve the management of AIDS-relateddiseases. 1.During the reception process at RDCC and MCIW all inmates shallattend group education presentations during the orientation process.The education process shall include a verbal instruction of AIDSrelated problems and how to protect oneself from becoming infected.Inmates shall be provided with written material about AIDS includinga booklet on HTLV-III test. A film developed by the Division ofCorrection and Johns Hopkins Medical Institution shall be shown. 2.Additional services shall be provided to all inmates known to haveserologic evidence of infection with the AIDS virus, inmates withAIDS-related complex (ARC), and nmates with AIDS. This educationat a minimum shall include inst. .tions in, responsible behaviorgiven the inmate's medical status. 3.Within thePre-Release System educational group meetings for inmates whowill be going home for family leave and/or working in the communityshall be held bi-weekly. No inmates may go home for family leave orwork in. the community without having attended an AIDS educational,ssion. 4.Employees shall be provided AIDS education by the Correctional Train-ing Academy during institutional orientation, and during routine in-service training. B.Procedures and EvaluationsThe procedure for identification and evaluation of inmates with suspectedAIDS are described below for new inmates seen at the Reception, Diagnosticand Classification Center (MRDCC) and the Maryland Correctio1,1 Insti-tution for Women (MCIW), as well as for those inmates currently in thecorrectional system as follows: 1.New Inmates:New inmates shall be evaluated at the MRDCC and MCIW. The followingitems shall supplement the pre-existing medical evaluation procedures.This screen shall be part of the medical screening for inmates re-turning from the street on work release or family leave or other typesof leave: a.History - Specific standardized questions are asked to obtain a 2 11Page 2 of6 Appendix 0 267 DCR NO.130-11 history of fever, thrush, night sweat, weight loss, diarrhea,and recent onset of a non-productive cough. The standardizedquestionnaire is attached to the intake physical examination forand is administered by a health care provider (Appendix 2). b.Physical examination - Protocols are designed to obtain a more care-ful oropharyngeal exam, lymph node search and anal examination.Items to be noted are given in Appendix 3. Health care providerswill be given regular in-service training to standardize the physi-cal examination procedures. cEpidemiological planning purposes - The antibody test may be usedfor epidemiological purposes. As indicated, groups may be asked toallow testing for the antibody to find the specific prevalencepatterns within incarcerated populations. These individuals shallnot be given the option of knowing their antibody status. Ablinding procedure has been set up and shall be maintained so thatno correctional laboratory personnel shall know the specific anti-body status of any individual screened for epidemiological purposes.Bloods used for these purposes are sent to the laboratory afterconsent is obtained from the inmate, labeled only with a codenumber.The demographic information available such as age, race,date of incarceration, and possible previous incarceration areput on the computer tapes and sent to the lab. The lab then teststhe blood, and matches the test results to the demographic infor-mation by the code number. No names are includ( ' either on theblood tube or computer tape. No laboratory personnel shall be giventhe individual test results. (In this way privacy of inmates aswell as job security of laboratory and correctional personnel issafeguarded.) 2.Inmates in the System Inmates already in the system will usually come to the attention of themedical providers through \"sick call.\" Inztates complaining of symptomsof AIDS or any symptoms indicative of one of tne opportunistic con-ditions should be evaluated as soon as possible. Inmates with signs andsymptoms of opportunistic infections shall be evaluated quickly.Failure to do so may resuLt in progress of infection to a stage At which it cannot be adequately treated. Two or more clinical diagnosed symptoms(see Appendix 4) should be presented before laboratory workup isobtained. A workup for AIDS related complaints shall include: a.History - Questionnaire about recent health status should be per-formed (Appendix 2). Questioning about AIDS risk factor may be ofinterest but is not of assistance in the manabemeut of these patients. b.Physical examiantion - The physical examination shall include weightto document weight loss, careful eye examination for exudates (CMV or 268 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES464Page 3 of 6 DCR NO. 130-11 toxoplasmosis, a careful examination of swollen lymph nodes orspleen, and a skin examination for new hyperpigmented nodularlesions herpetic lesions are those which persist or progresscoalescense.)The examination will be indicated on a copy ofAppendix 3. c.Laboratory - Blood should be drawn for the following test: CBC withdifferential white blood cell count and platlets, RPR chemistries,and hepatitis B screen. These patients should also have a chestx-ray.HIV antibody test is done only for those individuals whichhave two or more signs or symptoms. The test is only done withproper consent and counseling by the medical provider. C.Reporting and Management of Inmates With Suspected or Documented AIDS-Related DiseasesAll cases which have been worked up for the clinical workup for AIDS shouldbe documented on appendices 2, 3 and 4. Copies of these should be keptin the chart with the other medical information and a copy should be sentto Central Headquarters. If the patient is found to have ARC or AIDS, thereshould be an L mediate phone call to the Chief Medical Officer from theMedical Director for the region. If a case of AIDS is diagnosed in an out-lying hospital, for example the University of Maryland, the regional MedicalDirector that referred the case is responsible for obtaining as much infor-mation as possible to complete the report forms and to send those reportforms in as well as to call the verbal report to the Chief Medical Officer.At the time of verbal reporting over the telephone, the Chief Medical Officerwill discuss management and housing of the AIDS case or the ARC individualwith the Medical Director for the region. It is not expected that most ofthe individuals worked_up for AIDS related diseases will have been doneso purely because of clinical indications. There are many individuals whocome into the system and claim they have AIDS or AIDS infection. Becauseof the resulting confusion an AIDS workup is often indicated for these in-dividuals.When the clinical workup is completed, if there are less than twoclinical symptoms, the laboratory workup need not proceed. The person isthen counseled. It is explained to that person that they do not have AIDSand thatno further workup is necessary. As with all AIDS relateddisease reporting, Appendices.2, 3 and 4 are filled out for this individualand the report is sent out to DOC Headquarters. 1.Any change of status of any inmate shall be reported by telephone tothe Chief Medical Officer and the Director of Health and Mental HealthServices the same day. 2.This report shall be followed by written reports consisting of appendices1 - 4 marked appropriately as well as any other written materialnecessary to explain the clinical history and status of the inmate. 3.No inmate who is in categories 2 and 4 shall be transferred to any otherinstitution without the approval of the Commissioner Page 4 of 6 2 IS 3 Appendix G 269 DCR NO. 130-11 4.All press inquiries shall be referred to the DOC Headquarters PublicInformation Officer. D.Management of inmates - Inmates shall be medically managed as one of fivecategories: 1.General Population - there is not now and never has been any suspicionof an AIDS- rel.ted disease. 2.Possible AIDS-related diseases - there are at least two reasons beyondrisk factor status to suspect AIDS-related diseases. The reason tosuspect AIDS-related diseases are listed on the appendixes. Theseindividuals shall be cohorted at the regional infirmary and uppromptly for AIDS-related diseases. (Copies of Appendices 1-4 willbe filled out to indicate this patient's clinical status and placed inthe medical chart as well as sent to DOC headquarters.) 3.AIDS Related Complex (ARC) - patients with ARC defined in Appendix 4shall be medically monitored for signs of opportunistic diseases as listed in Appendix 1(Methods of Diagnosing Infectious Complications in AIDSPatients.)Medical monitoring ARC patients can be accomplished in theregional infirmary and does not require transfer to Baltimore. Thereshall be documentation of medical evaluation of progress of diseases atleast weekly. If the sp.oms resolve, the patient can be followed fromthe general population, wish documented followup evaluations monthly.4.AIDS - inmates with Al . as diagnosed by the methods detailed in Appendix 1shall be medically transferred to the Maryland Penitentiary hospital(females go to MCIW) on the authority of the Chief Medical Officer andregional Meeical Director without reclassification action. The privilegesallowed to ..tem shall be consistent with the privileges allowed otherinmates there, limited only by their individual medical needs. 5.AIDS - related diseases followup - those suspected AIDS patients whohave been worked up and found not to have any of the AIDS related diseasesshall be released back into the general population with regular followupto the medical clinic (at least every 6 months.)E.Infection Control Infection control procedures shall be observed as decribed in Appendix 5 forinfected individuals. More recent data has been published on risks of in-fection to health care workers WWII vol 34, no. 38, September 27, 1985.)All available data suggest that exposure during normal daily health carecarries far less risk of infection than the activity carries for infection to hepatitis B. F.Evaluation Protocol This evaluation protocol shall be evaluated periodically and updated in light of accumulating new information.

Nursing staff provideservices to meet tt,e health needs of these clients whileincarcerated.PRCTCCOLDESCRIPTION:AIDS is a d;===ce of the immune system that iscaused by the Humman Immunodeficiency Virus. The disease istransmitted through direct introduction of the virus into thebloodstream.People with the disease are left immunosuppressedwhich makes them susceptible to certain opportunisticinfections.High risk groups for the disease are people withmultiple sexual contacts, IV drug abusers and hemophiliacs.Those people in the high risk groups who are healthy andincubating the virus are probably more likely to transmit thevirus than those already ill. Incubation or \"carrier state\" maypersist for a protracted indefinite length of time prior todevelopment of clinical HIV disease. This protocol addressesnursing action for the four stages (as recognized by the CDC) ofEIV disease:primary, asymptomatic, symptomatic and AIDS.?CRPOSE:To appropriately treat and monitor AIDS in thecorrectional facilities. To prevent morbidity and mortality ofincarcerated youth and adults.DATA BASE:Subjective Clients will be identified at intakescreening or during the course of theirincarceration.They will present with ahistory of seropositivity, history of diseasebut currently asymptomatic or symptoms ofstage 3 or 4 disease. Note and document allsubjective information. Symptoms thatwarrant further work-up include aight sweats,fevers, weight loss, diarrhea, skin lesions(pink to purple, flat or raised, blotches orlumps, usually more firm than surroundingskin and usually painless), persistentfatigue, generalized lymphadenopathy, 278 AIDS IN CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE PROTOCOL - AIDS - PAGE 2 Objective Assessment Planshortness of breath, persistent dry cough,oral sores or inflammation, or dementia.Note whether the client belongs to a highrisk group.There is no standard list ofARCs but shouldnote the onset and duration of symptomsand/or the history surrounding diagnosis andtreatment.The above symptoms may also beindicative of several other conditions.The nurse should assess and document:-objective observation of symptoms.-signs of SOB, breath sounds.-BP, temperature, pulse and respirations.- measure current weight, ask client forusual or hocmal weight to note weight loss.-CWS changes (confusion, disorientation,balance or gait disturbances).-debilitation, cachexia; ,to what extent.Based on previous information:- has symptoms of HIV disease requiringfurther diagnostic work-up.- reliable history of ARC (note condition).-reliable history of AIDS (notepneumocystis, tOposi's Sarcoma, or otherdiagnositic condition).Nursing is based on diagnosis and treatment withclient's consent.-if severe respiratory symptoms, severediarrhea and dehydration; send to theEmergency Room.- if diagnosis of AIDS, investigatepossibility of release (849b2).-place on clinic list for next clinic.-house in general population.- notify head nurse about client (leavenote).Give name, DOB, diagnosis, symptomsand where housed.-if diarrhea present, attempt to house withown toilet.-if AIDS, place on HIGH RISK LIST.-if any concern about weight loss, getweekly weight and record.-refer all to Medical Social Work Staff.-refer to Jail or YGC psych staff ifindicated. 273 Appendix G 279 STANDARDIZED PROCEDURE PROTOCOL - AIDS - PAGE 3 Consultation Client Education Follow -ur-make appropriate referrals as indicated inFOLLOW-UP.If assessed situation is problematic and planof action unclear, consult with head nurse,charge nurse, medical director and/orphysician on-call to determine nursing action.Consult with Social Work supervisor toattempt to get these clients with verifieddiagnosis out of custody. 1.Explain exam and assessment process.2.Explain plan of action so he/she knowswhat to expect.
