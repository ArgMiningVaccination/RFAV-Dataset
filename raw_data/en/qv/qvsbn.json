If enforced, [Washington's vaccine mandate]would bar nearly two-thirds of Black adolescents from attending school, creating another obstacle for a population that our government should be empowering. The elite ruling class is happy to plaster \"Black Lives Matters\" stickers on their Teslas while supporting policies that hold back the next generation mere miles away.\" HEY! Here's a pop quiz for D.C. school officials!! Did you know that even the CDC recently updated its [\"guidance\"](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/71/wr/mm7133e1.htm) on its prevention recommendations, making your vaccine mandate even more of an obscene exercise in power & control muscle-flexing? (This is a \"YES\" OR \"NO\" question. Either way, your answer means you are clueless.) ICYMI: \"CDC's COVID-19 prevention recommendations no longer differentiate based on a person's vaccination status because breakthrough infections occur, though they are generally mild, and persons who have had COVID-19 but are not vaccinated have some degree of protection against severe illness from their previous infection.\" [BREAKING:](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2022/aug/26/judge-strikes-down-dcs-covid-19-vaccine-mandate-on/?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) There may be new hope on the horizon for D.C.'s school kids. That's because a judge just struck down D.C.'s COVID-19 vaccine mandate on its police saying the mayor lacked statutory authority to impose the requirement. Stay tuned! Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), announced this week that he intended to leave government service in December to \"pursue the next chapter\" of his career. While the FLCCC was elated to hear the news, Dr. Pierre Kory, Chief Medical Officer of the FLCCC and Dr. Paul Marik, Chief Scientific officer, hope that the world will long remember the carnage he will leave behind. \"We told the world, including Dr. Fauci, what we knew, but he refused to listen, and countless people suffered while so many senselessly died.\" \u2014Dr. Paul Marik \"Virtually all of our government's failed pandemic policies can be traced back to Dr. Fauci.\" \u2014Dr. Pierre Kory Read the official FLCCC statement on Dr. Fauci's upcoming retirement from NIAID [HERE](https://covid19criticalcare.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FLCCC-Statement-on-Fauci-Resignation-Aug-23-2022-REVISED.pdf). The first ever FLCCC Alliance educational conference will be held October 14-16 in Orlando, Florida! The FLCCC Alliance is excited to announce its inaugural conference to bring together the top experts in the fields of pathology, evaluation, and treatment of spike-protein induced diseases. Lectures will focus on the pathogenesis of these diseases, diagnosing both Long COVID and Post Vaccine Syndromes and the latest, most effective approaches to treatment. The conference will gather some of the nation's foremost COVID experts and health care providers to learn, share and network \u2014 and most importantly to drive greater attention and awareness of the increasing number of patients afflicted with post COVID and post vaccine chronic conditions\u2014many of whom are not getting treatment today.

For some time now, our Dr. Pierre Kory has been writing about the [global disinformation campaign against ivermectin ](https://pierrekory.substack.com/p/the-global-disinformation-campaign-a3c?r=nxypy&s=r&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web)on his Friends, his [ latest Substack series](https://pierrekory.substack.com/p/the-global-disinformation-campaign-a3c) is one that reads like a crime thriller novel...except this is no work of fiction. It is tragically real. Dr. Kory takes you deep inside \"The Fix\"\u2014the inner workings of a global crime against humanity, for which he had \u2014 and sadly continues to have \u2014 a front row seat. While we believe that one day in the not-too-distant-future, Dr. Kory's essays will be turned into a true crime television series on 60 Minutes, 20/20, Dateline, or another similar program, YOU can read them [here](https://pierrekory.substack.com/) right now, pretty much in real time, as these crimes continue to be perpetrated upon all of humankind. \"Invest the time to educate yourself as to how it all happened. I think it is extremely important that more of society understand how the Science of Medicine has been corrupted and is being corrupted to this day. The time investment, in my mind, will be world-changing in perspective. But I will let you be the judge.\" \u2014Dr. Pierre Kory To date, well over 6 million people worldwide have lost their lives to COVID-19. That tragic, astronomical figure has caused commentators and observers who believe that most died needlessly to liken the failed global response to the pandemic to the Holocaust. To be sure, these comparisons have been controversial, with many saying that the horrific and systematic decimation of Jews and many other marginalized peoples at the hands of the Nazis during the Holocaust stands alone in the annals of modern human history. Others counter, saying that millions who died during the pandemic were exterminated due to toxic public health policies and mandates that demonized, silenced and banned safe, efficacious, cheap and globally available treatments in favor of novel drugs and injections meant to keep Big Pharma's ever-swelling coffers healthy.* But now comes Vera Sharav\u2014herself a Holocaust survivor\u2014and a public advocate for human rights and the founder and president of the Alliance for Human Research Protection (AHRP). [AHRP](https://ahrp.org/) is an information resource and public interest watchdog organization whose goal is to \"unlock the walls of secrecy in biomedical research and bring accountability to that endeavor.\" During an August 20 address to those gathered in Nuremberg, Germany, at an event hosted by Action Alliance, a group of German activists, to commemorate the [75th anniversary](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/75-anniversary-nuremberg-code-chd-tv-livestream/) of the Nuremberg Code, Ms. Sharav said: The Holocaust did not begin in the gas chambers of Auschwitz and Treblinka. The Holocaust was preceded by nine years of incremental restrictions on personal freedom, and the suspension of legal rights and civil rights. The stage was set by fear-mongering and hate-mongering propaganda. Sharav went on to say that \"Today, doctors and scientists who challenge the approved [COVID] narrative are maligned, their reputations trashed. They risk [losing their license](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/rfk-jr-defender-meryl-nass-suspended-misinformation/) to practice as well as having their homes and workplace raided by SWAT teams. The moral significance of the [Nuremberg Code](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199711133372006) cannot be overstated.\" [HERE](https://childrenshealthdefense.org/defender/vera-sharav-nuremberg-code-speech-germany/) is the link to her entire presentation. *FOOTNOTE: It feels unseemly to quibble at all about whether or not comparisons to the Holocaust are justified. As you will see in her presentation, Sharav points out that, \"Few people recognize foreboding similarities between current policies and those under the Nazi regime. By declaring a state of emergency \u2014 in 1933 and in 2020\u2014 constitutionally protected personal freedom, legal rights and civil rights were swept aside. Repressive, discriminatory decrees followed.\" Perhaps we can agree that unless these freedoms, legal and civil rights are unconditionally granted to all in perpetuity, the door opens wide to genocide. This week's update hosted by Betsy Ashton was a fascinating tour of COVID-19, Histamine and your Gut. There are none more qualified than Dr. Keith Berkowitz and Dr. Robin Rose who shared, for example, how refined sugars kill your gut microbiome, what Alpha diversity and Beta diversity are, and so much more.

Let's talk about Resveratrol\u2014a polyphenol (micronutrients that naturally occur in plants). It can be found in berries, peanuts, pistachios, red wine and the skin of red grapes. Resveratrol is also an antiviral and anti-inflammatory, and prevents insulin resistance!
