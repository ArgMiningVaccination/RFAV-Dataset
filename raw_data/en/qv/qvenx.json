Nevertheless, there has been some public awareness on the potential opportunities that could be tapped from the use of TAM and its benefits to the health sector. By formulating this policy, the MOHSW has moved in the right direction to recognize and guide TAM practice in the country. It is envisaged that the Policy will optimize the benefits of traditional and alternative medicine practice, its cultivation, harvest, production and marketing to the people of Zanzibar. The integration of Traditional and Alternative medicines into national health care system has the potential to supplement, strengthen and promote better health care for all, in line with the national vision. The implementation of this Policy will require mutual cooperation between different stakeholders within and outside the country. Since traditional medicine uses various natural resources for the preparation of medicinal products, environmental control should be emphasized in order to sustain indigenous plants and other sources of traditional medicine products including indigenous knowledge for the future. The Policy defines the role of TAM in Zanzibar's health care delivery system and provides a framework for coordination of activities related to the development of TAM in the private and public sectors. It is my sincere hope that all stakeholders will take their respective responsibilities towards ensuring good traditional and alternative medicine practices in Zanzibar in order to achieve better health for our people. Hon. Sultan M. Mugheiry Minister of Health and Social Welfare ZANZIBAR. -iv- GLOSSARY OF TERMS For the purpose of this policy the following definitions may apply: Alternative Medical systems: These are traditional medicine systems that are built upon complete systems of theory and practice. Examples of alternative medical systems that have developed in Western cultures include homeopathic medicine and naturopathic medicine. Examples of systems that have developed in non-Western cultures include traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurveda. Acupuncture This describes a family of procedures involving stimulation of anatomical points on the body by a variety of techniques. American practices of acupuncture incorporate medical traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries. The acupuncture technique that has been most studied scientifically involves penetrating the skin with thin, solid, metallic needles that are manipulated by the hands or by electrical stimulation. Aromatherapy This involves the use of essential oils (extracts or essences) from flowers, herbs, and trees to promote health and well-being. Ayurveda This includes diet and herbal remedies and emphasizes the use of body, mind, and spirit in disease prevention and treatment. Chiropractic This is an alternative medical system which focuses on the relationship between bodily structure (primarily that of the spine) and function, and how that relationship affects the preservation and restoration of health. Chiropractors use manipulative therapy as an integral treatment tool. Dietary supplements These are products taken by mouth that contain a \"dietary ingredient\" intended to supplement the diet. Dietary ingredients may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botanicals, amino acids, and substances such as enzymes, organ tissues, and metabolites. Homeopathic medicine This is an alternative medical system. In homeopathic medicine, there is a belief that \"like cures like,\" meaning that small, highly diluted quantities of medicinal substances are given to cure symptoms, when the same substances given at higher or more concentrated doses would actually cause those symptoms. -v-Massage therapists These manipulate muscle and connective tissue to enhance function of those tissues and promote relaxation and well-being. Traditional Chinese medicine This is the current name for an ancient system of health care from China. Among the components of TAM are herbal and nutritional therapy, restorative physical exercises, meditation, acupuncture, and remedial massage. -vi-1. INTRODUCTION Zanzibar experiences tropical marine climate and thus is covered with a variety of plants and spices both natural and cultivated. Some of these plants and spices have been used for generations for the treatment of common ailments found in the islands. According to WHO, in Africa up to 80% of the population uses traditional medicines to help meet their health care needs. Many people in Zanzibar also use traditional medicines and with the increased shortages of drugs in the public sector and their high prices in the private sector, the demand for traditional medicine has been increasing within the population. In the Alma - Ata Declaration of 1978 recognition was given to the role of traditional medicine and its practitioners in achieving health for all. The WHO Regional Committee for Africa by its resolution AFR/RC34/R8 of 1984, urged Member States to prepare specific legislation to govern the practise of traditional medicine as part of national health legislation and ensure an adequate budget allocation that will make for effective development of traditional medicine. Traditional medicine is used in the maintenance of health as well as in the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical and mental illnesses. The MOHSW recognizes and advocates for the use of traditional medicine and supports the idea of incorporating it into the national health system with the objective of ensuring that traditional medicine treatment is done scientifically, rationally and with safety to the Zanzibaris Community. The Zanzibar Traditional and alternative Medicine policy identifies the goals, key policy objectives and guiding principles including the establishment of a legal and regulatory framework on TAM practices and therapies, education and training, research and development etc. In order to promote and ensure good TAM practice, a strategic plan for the implementation of the policy will be developed and which will include a number of measures to be undertaken. These include: v Creating awareness on the role played by TAM practices to the community. TAM v Enactment of appropriate legislation. v Supporting the development and maintenance of TAM delivery, research and training facilities. v Development of appropriate curricula for skills and competences necessary for TAM practices. v Establishment of standards for hygienic working environment etc. The policy seeks to promote collaboration and partnership with all relevant partners. It -1-also aims to promote appropriate methods and technologies in the development of TAM practices that will improve the quality, safety and efficiency of TAM products. Definition According to the WHO, traditional medicine is \"the total combination of knowledge and practices, whether explicable or not, used in diagnosing, preventing or eliminating physical, mental or social diseases and which may rely exclusively on past experience and observation handed down from generation to generation, verbally or n writing\" The terms \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" are used inter-changeably with traditional medicine in some countries. They refer to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system. Scope of Traditional medicine Various traditional medicine practices have been developed in different cultures in different regions. These can be classified as: 1. Traditional v Chinese Traditional Medicine v Ayuverdic medicine v Unani Medicine v Indigenous Medicine 2. Non- Traditional v Homeotherapy v Chiropractic 3. Therapies v Medication therapies v Medicinal Plants &herbs v Minerals v Animal materials v Diet and Nutrition 4. Non-medication therapies v acupuncture v manual therapy v traditional exercises v Physical, mental, spiritual and mind body therapies. Role of Traditional Medicine Traditional medicine has established promotive, preventive, curative and rehabilitative role. TM can be an integrated component of the mainstream of health care or an alternative or complementary to the health care system in Zanzibar. -2-Rationale traditional medicine use in Zanzibar Long historical use of many practices of traditional medicine, including experience passed on from generation to generation, has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of traditional medicine. The products used can be easily found naturally and are easily affordable by majority of the community. Apart from that, cultural acceptability on Traditional medicine is high since it applies a holistic approach to treatment. However, scientific research is needed to provide additional evidence of its safety and efficacy. Need for national policy on Traditional and Alternative Medicine (TAM) A National Policy on TAM is needed for the following reasons: v The use of traditional medicine TAM is widespread in Zanzibar therefore it is necessary to encourage better practice of such treatment in a modern way v To define the role of traditional medicine in health care delivery systems. v To ensure the direction, action and provision of financial and other resources as well as government commitment to support the traditional and alternative medicine practices. v To guide on legislation and regulations in order to ensure its safety, efficacy and quality. v To assist in the control of the increased medical expenditures. v To make Traditional and alternative medicine much affordable and cost-effective form of health care. v To encourage the proper conservation and cultivation of traditional medicine v To promote local manufacturing of traditional medicines v To protect traditional medicine knowledge, preservation of biodiversity and intellectual property rights -3-2. SITUATION ANALYSIS The current situation of TAM in Zanzibar indicates that, majority of the population uses TAM for treatment of various diseases. Different traditional medicine methods, which have been practiced in Zanzibar, include herbal medicine, massage/manipulation, steam/ heat, diet, exercise, spiritual and mental therapy. Unfortunately up to now, there are no studies or researches to investigate the pharmacologically active substances in the plants used for these purposes. Also, the advocacy for integration of TAM into national health care system has just started. The development of this policy therefore should serve as a catalyst to fully engage all stakeholders including Members of the public into the development and integration of traditional medicine in the National health system. Legislation and Regulation Up to now, there has not been any comprehensive legislation and regulation of TAM in Zanzibar. The practice of traditional medicine has been performed without control of the Government. Importation and exportation of medicinal and herbal products however was controlled under the Agricultural legislation. The MOH&SW with support from the WHO has developed a draft Traditional medicine legislation that should regulate traditional medicine practice in the country. Research and development In Zanzibar, like many other developing countries, education, training and research in this area has not been performed due to inadequate attention and support. Research is needed to ascertain the efficacy and safety of several other practices and medicinal plants. Unregulated or inappropriate use of traditional medicines and practices can have negative or dangerous effects. Research findings will provide the proof of safety and efficacy of herbal medicines. Information may appear in an authoritative national documents (such as pharmacopoeias or official guidelines of national authority) or scientific publications. In conducting research and evaluating ZTAM, knowledge and experience obtained through the long history of established practices should be respected. Administration Previously, there was no administrative set up at National level that recognized and managed the TAM practices. However, some NGOs initiated by the traditional practitioners themselves ran and controlled various activities concerned with TAM. Therefore, the aim now is to initiate a Traditional medicine administrative structure not only at National level but also at lower levels. Training and capacity building Traditional Medicines in Zanzibar is currently in the hands of Traditional healers whose knowledge is highly individualized. They obtain their knowledge through heritage i.e. handed-over from generation to generation. -4-Integration of traditional medicines into health system in Zanzibar will lead to better understanding of the specific roles and practices of Traditional Medicine. Therefore, a system for training health workers and traditional health practitioners on aspects of the Traditional Medicines will be developed and put in place. Information Although there is some information on TAM, some ignorance on the nature and scope of TAM still exists in some Members of the population. The perceived negative aspects of TAM have often tended to obscure the real benefits. Currently there is no established system for information dissemination and sharing of TAM systems and products. This has hindered the development of this sub sector. The development of information, education and communication strategies on Traditional Medicines for traditional practitioners, consumers and the general public should be encouraged. Registration All traditional and alternative medicine practitioners should be registered including their working premises. The aim is to ensure that TAM practices are conducted in accordance to regulations in order to attain the good quality of materials used as well as the better treatment to patients. Local Production Zanzibar Traditional healers are producing on small scale, various plants-based preparations for some disease conditions. The Policy objectives are to improve the quality and quantity of traditional and alternative medicines for internal and commercial use. This would ensure a sustainable and safe environment for the production of herbal medications at local and at industrial levels. Intellectual Property Rights Protection There are no special reserved areas for Medicinal Plants. Different NGOs had established small scale Botanical gardens in order to obtain raw materials for herbal medicines in special allocated areas. The Policy on protection and conservation of herbal biological resource as per existing laws could assist to ensure a sustainable availability of raw materials for traditional medicinal products at all times. Similarly, the establishment of mechanisms for greater protection of traditional medical knowledge, preservation of biodiversity, and equitable sharing of benefits or proceeds accruing from the appropriate utilization of biodiversity indigenous to Zanzibar could lead to a sustainable practice of traditional medicine. -5-Processing and marketing Processing of herbal medicine is done locally and the quality of end products does not meet required standards. This is due to lack of appropriate technology, equipments and expertise in the area. The marketing situation is also not reliable. Traditional medicine practitioners rely only on National trade fairs such as \"Saba saba\" and \"Nane nane\" and through exhibitions during the African traditional medicine day for marketing their goods. The policy on processing and marketing is to develop appropriate and profitable marketing, pricing and post harvesting systems so that it can match with world market trends. International Collaboration MOH&SW, in its effort to strengthen TAM in Zanzibar has promoted international collaboration on TAM practice with different countries such as China, India, Egypt etc which have a developed traditional medicine practice and markets. On the other hand, a non - governmental organization of traditional health practitioners in Zanzibar has already started close collaboration with other practitioners within East African Partner States. The NGO has been recognized by international organizations working toward the preservation and restoration of ancient arts of traditional medicine known as PROMETRA. Other collaborations have been with United Nations Organizations and in particular the WHO, which has been providing full support in the development of the practice in the country. -6-3.
