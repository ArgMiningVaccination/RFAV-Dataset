Acupuncture is a complete system of health care that is used to diagnose and treat disease, prevent illness, and improve well-being. A safe and effective form of treatment that originated in China more than 3,000 years ago, acupuncture is long proven to balance and heal the body. Very fine needles are carefully inserted into specific points on the body to stimulate your natural ability to heal itself. Studies have shown that acupuncture: - helps control and eliminate pain - reduces inflammation - balances the mood - promotes tissue regeneration and bone healing - regulates the gastrointestinal tract - boosts the immune system - regulates the endocrine system for gynecological disorders - promotes fertility. The treatments work on both the particular symptom pattern as well as the underlying conditions that may have allowed the symptoms to develop in the first place. Acupuncture Styles Sandra draws upon an eclectic blend of styles that includes the sports acupuncture techniques of Matt Callison and Whitford Reeves, the Balance Method treatments of Richard Tan, the system promoted by Dr. Tran Viet Dzung, and the Japanese acupuncture and moxibustion techniques of the Kiiko Matsumoto and Master Nagano style. She is certified in the Kiiko Matsumoto tradition. COVID-19 Policy Your safety is my priority. I've implemented several changes to create a safe environment for you to receive your acupuncture care. I am not seeing patients in person who have COVID or COVID symptoms (a fever, new cough [other than known allergies or asthma], difficulty breathing [aside from a prior history of asthma], or an acute loss of sense of smell) or are acutely ill. Masks are strongly encouraged, but are only required if you have a cough, are sneezing, or have been in recent contact with someone who has COVID, COVID symptoms, or the flu.
