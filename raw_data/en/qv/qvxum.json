From the start of the audiobook, I felt at ease. There is a meditative feel to this narration that helped calm me during the hypnosis. What was one of the most memorable moments of Spiritual Cleanse: Detox the Mind, Body and Spirit with Hypnosis? The actual hypnosis part was quite soothing. It felt as though my spiritual cache was being emptied. Quite a lovely feeling. I felt as though my brain waves changed, along with my attitude. My mood was relaxed immediately afterwards, and I felt a certain peace within me. What's an idea from the book that you will remember? I'll try to keep the peace I found while listening to this hypnosis. Although, I suspect I'll have to listen to it again when my soul requires some more winding down and detoxing. It's a shame such peaceful states don't last forever and you have to continuously work at it, because it feels amazing. 35 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Shari Ring Wolf](/listener/amzn1.account.AHHZNYQJFK4DK7HVA4U24WXXWKLQ?ref=a_pd_Spirit_c15_rvlsnl_2&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=X785A54TJ8SCCYCY27QD&pageLoadId=XwZCIeFVYyN0Ep5T&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 12-14-15 beautiful and relaxing I really clicked with the visualization , I could feel it in my body by seeing it in my mind. after the visualization, there is 45 mins of music so you may want to set your timer. 3 people found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Webbersue](/listener/amzn1.account.AGM2VQKRRXDL444JQVEKDSW5AGHA?ref=a_pd_Spirit_c15_rvlsnl_3&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=X785A54TJ8SCCYCY27QD&pageLoadId=XwZCIeFVYyN0Ep5T&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 02-03-17 I needed this loved it! it helped me open up and let all the bad out and let the good in. very healing 1 person found this helpful - Overall - Performance - Story - [Nancy B](/listener/amzn1.account.AFYNFWWQCZNJUYS46AO62POZQM4Q?ref=a_pd_Spirit_c15_rvlsnl_4&pf_rd_p=688a1b7e-3d44-49e7-a3fe-2be4c28264cd&pf_rd_r=X785A54TJ8SCCYCY27QD&pageLoadId=XwZCIeFVYyN0Ep5T&creativeId=88c226af-6ce7-461c-9842-163d82e49648) - 12-27-15 subliminal without telling you This book wasn't for you, but who do you think might enjoy it more? Seventeen minutes of hypnosis and then music that I didn't chose. Blah and irritating.. I don't like subliminal stuff and wouldn't have purchased it, had I known. What could Dr. William White have done to make this a more enjoyable book for you? A long hypnosis session would have been nice. I won't listen to it again. How did the narrator detract from the book? I liked her voice. She did fine it was the shortness of it and then creepy music. I wouldn't have purchased it if they had of presented the music only in the sample. Ripped off and angry - is how I feel instead of blissful and spiritually cleansed -it wasn't the narrators fault.
