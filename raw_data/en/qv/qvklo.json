ABSTRACT Therapy of chronic recurrent vulvovaginal can- didiasis (VVC) caused by Candida glabrata is still rare in comparison to C. albicans infection, but therapy remains more difficult. Combination therapy with topical antifungals may improve therapy outcome, but still standard agents as fluconazole or itraconazole often fail. Posa- conazole is a new systemic triazole with a wide antifungal spectrum including rare Candida species. Up to now, no clinical trials with posa- conazole in chronic recurrent VVC have been undertaken. Here, first results of the application of a new therapy regimen consisting of oral posaconazole in combination with topical ci-clopiroxolamine are presented. 15 patients with chronic recurrent VVC caused by C. glabrata have been treated. 14 of these patients experi-enced successful therapy, clinical and myco- logical cure 30 days after begin of therapy has been observed. Long-term results are promising, as in 4 patients clinical and mycologic cure persists for more than 1 year up to now. Keywords: Chronic Recurrent termed chronic if it recurs four times or more per year at intervals of 8 weeks or less [1]. Literature data suggest that acute vul- vovaginal candidiasis becomes chronic in 5-8 % of cases [2,3]. Possible, but heatedly debated, risk factors for vaginal thrush include prior antibiotic or corticosteroid therapy, intrauterine contr aceptive devices (coil), high- sugar diet, and certain sexual practices [2]. The etiology of chronic recurrent VVC is little understood even today. Gastrointestinal tract as a reservoir for re-infection, re-infection from sexual partner(s), and recurrent disease as a result of persistent colonization have been postu-lated. This last postulate is supported by studies showing recurrent disease to be caused by identical strains in the vast majority of cases [2]. Though C. albicans is the main pathogen in more than 95% of cases of acute infection [4], other species are implicated in chronic infectio n, chiefly C. glabrata. The characteristic features of Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are listed in Table 1 . The pathogenic role of C. glabrata is disputed, but pa- tients who present to a physician with fungal disease caused by these atypical pathogens always report symp- toms. Though vaginal discharge is rare, redness, agoniz- ing itching, and a sour-sme lling sticky discharge are characteristic. A diagnosis of \"harmless commensal\" is therefore both inappropriate an d scientifically inaccurate. Both organisms are biosafety class 1 organisms. Hence, though low-virulence, they are not apathogenic\u2014unlike Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 2. TREATMENT OF PROBLEM FUNGI The therapeutic goal in ch ronic recurrent VVC is the eradication of the pathogen. The chances of achieving that goal appear to be good. Unlike C. albicans, non- albicans Candida organisms are located predominantly vaginally. Measures to prevent recurrence should be ini- tiated before starting therapy [5]. Oral and bowel con- tamination in the patient (3 fecal samples taken on 3 different days) should be investigated, which may result in measures such as professional dental and denture cleaning and eradication of pathogens in the mouth and bowel with amphotericin B or nystatin (C. glabrata) in the form of lozenges or sugar-coated tablets. A hormonal coil is a potential pathogen reservoir and should ideally be removed before therapy. The sexual partner should be involved in treatment too. Colonization of the prostate (sperm sample) and contamination of dentures (smear tests) in older partners should be investigated. H. J. Tietz / HEALTH 2 (2010) 513-518 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

C. glabrata is located deep in vaginal tissue-up to 10 layers deep-which explains the high failure rate for local treatment attempts. C. glabrata also thrives in surface lo cations-under the foreskin, around the clitoris, in the anal folds and pubic hair-and so the effectiveness of systemic therapy is limited. Therefore, combination therap y seems to be necessary to appropriately treat the patient and avoid recurrence of infection. It needs to be stressed that in addition, patient cooperation is crucial, as rigorous, reliable local treat- ment is required in conjunction with properly adminis- tered systemic therapy. C. glabrata isolates have very low sensitivity to flu- conazole and may be resistant in many cases. Secondary resistance is mainly due to two factors: genetic variabil- ity of the pathogen, which develops resistance to flu- conazole at doses below 800 mg, and the fact that many therapists administer fluconazole doses as low as 150 mg [6]. In contrast, in vitro sensitivity to posaconazole is high [7]. Until just a few years ago, systemic high-dose treatment with 800 mg fluconazole was the treatment of first choice [8]. Given the la rge number of current treat-ment failures, the treatment approach is not advisable today [5]. Nevertheless, the options for treating invasive fungal infection of the kind are better now than ever. The most promising agents according to the current state of scientific knowledge are the triazole derivative posa- conazole and the The latter require intravenous dosing and are associated with high treatment costs. Since vaginal can- didiasis is usually treated in an ambulatory setting, these agents are of lesser relevance for treatment. Ciclopiroxolamine is the most effective local drug for treating clotrimazole- and nystatin-resistant organisms [8]. It is the antifungal with the broadest spectrum, as well as showing deep penetration and sporicidal activity. The mechanism of action is polyvalent. Ciclopiroxola- mine's activity is not limited to the level of ergosterol synthesis. It also targets regions mitochondria and pro-tein synthesis, making it the ideal combination partner for all systemic antifungals. Inhibition of catalase pro- duction is particularly effective, because it disables me- tabolization of toxic H 2O2 occurring in the fungal cell. All clinically relevant Candida species are sensitive to ciclopiroxolamine [8]. Posaconazole is a triazole derivative whose mecha- nism of action is based on inhibiting ergosterol synthesis [9]. It is effective against a variety of fungal pathogens. These include all relevant Aspergillus species, the for and ]. The spectrum of action also includes Candida an d especially the problem pathogens C. glabrata and C. krusei [7,10] which are resistant to fluconazole, itraconazole and voriconazole. Posaconazole's molecular structure gives it multiple docking sites, so different mutations would have to oc-cur simultaneously for it to be ineffective [12]. In con- trast, a single mutation is enough to induce resistance to fluconazole [12]. Posaconazole has linear kinetics up to a dose of 800 mg [9]. Exposure can be increased by di- vision into two divided doses of 400 mg (10 ml suspen- sion BID), and is further enhanced by dosing together with high-fat food, e.g. custard made with full-fat milk. It has a high volume of distribution (1744 liters), sug- gesting very good distribution. Posaconazole is metabo-lized to a very slight extent and is primarily eliminated with the feces. Posaconazole has the lowest potential for interactions of all systemic azole derivatives, since in-teractions with the CYP system are limited to CYP3A4 inhibition. The most common side effects reported in studies involving a total of 2400 subjects and patients were headache and nausea [9]. Posaconazole is approved for prevention of systemic infection in high-risk he-mato-oncology patients, for salvage therapy of certain H. J. Tietz / HEALTH 2 (2010) 513-518 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 515515 invasive for the treatment of oro- pharyngeal candidiasis [9]. Up to now, there is no clini- cal data supporting efficacy in treatment of vaginal can-didiasis. In a murine vaginal model, posaconazole re- duced the burden fluconazole-susceptible and fluconazole-resistant Ca ndida albicans strains [4]. The difficulty to treat chronic vaginal infections cau- sed by C. glabrata lead to the development of a concept comprising a posaconazole-ciclopiroxolamine combina-tion therapy for patients, who seemed to have exhausted all conventional treatment options. 3. PATIENTS Patients were eligible if they had a chronic vaginal can- didiasis caused by C. glabrata, a history of therapy fail- ure and reduced sensitivity towards licensed antifungals indicated by susceptibility testing. All patients were carefully examined, including mi- crobiologic and dermatologic diagnosis, to exclude non- or recurrence, the patients' surroundings were care- fully examined mycologically by taking swabs or sam- ples and cultivation on appropriate media (see Diagnos- tic Procedures). This included the partner's oral cavity, penis and sperm, but also the patient's oral cavity, vagina, clitoris and faeces. Vaginal swabs of all patients were taken and cultured before start of therapy for species identification and susceptibility testing. Foreign objects as Nuva-Ring or hormonal coil were removed before start of therapy. Therapy response was assessed by clinical and my- cologic examination at 7 and 30 days after end of ther- apy, respectively. For some patients, long-term results up to 2 years after therapy are available. Patients who have been treated here come from all over Germany, so that long-term follow-up is not pos sible in every case. For mycologic examination, vaginal and clitoris swabs were taken and inoculated as described below. Further follow- up visits are conducted regularly, about every 30 days, the results are presented below. A successful therapy outcome was defined as substan- tial improvement of the patient's clinical infection signs and symptoms 7 days after start of treatment, as well as persistent clinical and mycologic cure 30 days after be- gin of therapy. All patients were informed about the compassionate use project in depth and about the existing database on posaconazole in antifungal treatment. Health insurance reimbursement was checked and agreed in advance for all patients. 4. DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES For species identification, swabs were inoculated onto chromIDTM Candida agar, bioM\u00e9rieux Deutschland GmbH, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany, which is isolation and direct identification of Candida albicans. Candida albicans colonies are coloured blue by specific hydroly- sis of a hexosaminidase chromogenic substrate after 2 day of incubation at 37\u00b0C. The species identification of non-blue-coloured colonies like C. glabrata and C. krusei were examined by their assimilation pattern with the ID 32C yeast identification system, bioM\u00e9rieux Deutschland GmbH, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany. ID 32C sys- tem consists of a single-use disposable plastic strip with 32 wells to perform 29 assimi lation tests (carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids), 1 assimilation test with a negative control, 1 susceptibility test (cycloheximide), and 1 colorimetric test (esculin) including a database of 63 different species. Results were recorded by direct reading after 48 h of incubation at 30\u00b0C. The susceptibility of all isolates towards itraconazole and flucoanzole was tested routinely, as these are the only systemic antifungal agents licensed to treat VVC. FUNGITEST TM, Bio-Rad, Marnes-la Coquette, France was used. In general, this test is used to study growth of yeasts in the presence of 6 antifungal agents at 2 differ- ent concentrations, among them fluconazole and itra- conazole. Growth assessment is based on reduction of the coloured indicator which turns the medium from blue to pink. When growth is inhibited by the fungal agent, the medium remains blue. Two growth and 2 negative controls are included in the test system. The interpreta- tion of the results was performed according the follow- ing colour characteristics: Bl ue-blue = no growth, strain inhibited by the antifungal agent, sensitive strain (\"S\"); Pink-blue = low growth, intermediate strain (\"I\"); Pink- pink = growth, strain not inhibited by the antifungal agent, resistant strain (\"R\"). The breakpoints have been chosen following the study of the distribution of the an- tifungal agents MIC obtained with prototype microplates used with the same procedure as FUNGITEST TM. If susceptibility testing indicates intermediate susceptibility or resistance towards flucon azole or itraconazole, ther- apy attempts with these agents cannot expect to be suc- cessful because of the genetic haploidy of C. glabrata. 5. THERAPY All patients received a combination of systemic and topical therapy ( Table 1 ). For systemic therapy, posa- conazole was administered for 15 days at a daily dose of 800 mg (10 ml BID). Topical therapy consisted of cicl- opiroxolamine cream BID admi nistered intravaginally H. J. HEALTH 2 (2010) Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 516 every morning and evening. 12 of the patients received additional topical treatment with Nystatin Ovula (100,000 IU q.d.). Further measures were initiated in addition, if required: shaving of pubic hair of both partners before initiating therapy; antifungal decontamination of both partners (mouth, bowel, sperm). 6. RESULTS 15 patients with chronic vaginal candidiasis caused by C. glabrata were treated ( Table 3 ). On average, they were 46.2 years old (range 20-76 years). For all patients, vaginal control swabs at baseline were positive for Can- dida glabrata, and most of the patients also had evidence of C. glabrata below the clitoral hood. 13 of the 15 pa- tients had a history of failed treatment with fluconazole, 2 of these patients received even more than one systemic antifungal. Remaining 2 of the 15 patients had both been pretreated topically with clotrimazole. Both patients were infected with C. glabrata-strains that showed only intermediate susceptibility to fluconazole and itracona- zole. In total, 7 of 15 C. glabrata strains were resistant to fluconazole, 6 showed intermediate susceptibility and 2 results indicated susceptibility, although both patients experienced clinical failure with fluconazole. All 7 strains resistant towards fluc onazole were also itracona- zole-resistant, and in addition, one of the strains exhi- biting intermediate susceptibility towards fluconazole tested itraconazole-resistant. No strain was itraconazole- susceptible. All patients received treatment with posaconazole and ciclopiroxolamine in accordance with the regimen in Table 2 . 14 of the 15 patients were treated successfully with this regimen: they experienced substantial clinical improvement already after 7 days of treatment; no clini- cal signs and symptoms of the infection could be dete- cted 30 days after begin of therapy, and all mycologic swabs were negative for Candida glabrata. 11 of the 14 patients with successful therapy outcome after 30 days could be monitored for a longer time to detect a possible recurrence of infection. No patient showed any sign or symptom of recurrent fungal infection, and culture di- agnostics have always been negative since. Clinical and mycological cure persists for about 60 days in 4 patients, for 90 days in 3 patients and for more than 1 year in 4 of the patients. Clinical success of the applied therapy regimen is documented photographically. One patient (patient No. 7 in Table 3 ) experienced therapy failure. This patient evidently failed to implement the treatment processes. She was transferred to hospital for intrave- nous treatment with an echinocandin, and topical therapy has been stopped there. The patient experienced recur- rence of infection. Posaconazole was well tolerated by all patients, similarly to fluconazole. 7. DISCUSSIONS Modern systemic antifungals such as posaconazole open up prospects for successful and sustainable therapy. No clinical data are available to date on posaconazole in the treatment of chronic recurrent vaginal candidiasis. Pre- clinical data suggest that posaconazole may be an option for this difficult-to-treat infection [4,7,12]. Posacona- zole activity against Candida species seems to be high [7]. The key to a successful cure seems to be the combina- tion of the highly active substances posaconazole and ciclopiroxolamine. Since nysta tin is effective against C. glabrata, it may be included in the treatment regimen as well. Posaconazole has been favoured as systemic combi- nation partner over an echinocandin, although the main indication of echinocandins is the therapy of Candida Table 2.

Echinocandins are only available in intrave- nous formulation, hence thei r application is complicated and maybe too costly in an ambulatory setting. On the basis of the current state of scientific knowl- edge, it was possible to develop a treatment concept for successful treatment of patients who had exhausted con- ventional treatment options. From an ethical point of view, too, it was appropriate not to withhold the drug until marketing authorization. Unlike C. albicans fungal disease, which typically is associated with a high risk of re-infection, disease caused by C. glabrata was success- fully cured. 14 of 15 patients in this drug use evaluation achieved a cure. The follow-up period ranged from 90 days to 2 years in 11 of the 14 patients, no relapses oc- curred. Concomitant topical tr eatment deserves merit as the second mainstay of success; systemic antifungals on their own will probably not r each all the remote niches in which pathogens may be present. Larger clinical trials should be conducted to further study the efficacy of posacon azole in the treatment of chronic recurrent vaginal candidiasis caused by rare Candida species as C. glabrata and krusei.

ABSTRACT The peripheral blood is a major source of he- matopoietic stem cells. Almost for two decades the peripheral blood has been mobilized, in or- der to enhance the CD34 + concentration. The isolated stem cells from the mobilized periph- eral blood are used as an alternative, or in addi- tion to bone marrow derived stem cells. In this paper, a new perspective is being discussed; the use of non-mobilized peripheral blood as an alternative source for hematopoietic progenitor cells. The number of isolated hematopoietic stem cells is evaluated using flow cytometry. The vi- ability can be evaluated using the trypan blue exclusion test, the flow cytometry or automated assays. The isolated hematopoietic stem cells could be used for ex vivo expansion either in static systems or in proper bioreactor systems, prior to cryopreservation and/or transplantation. Keywords: Non-Mobilized Peripheral Blood; Hematopoietic Stem Cells; Ex Vivo Expansion 1. INTRODUCTION Since the early 1990s, peripheral blood progenitor cells collected by apheresis have largely replaced bone mar-row as a source of hematopoietic stem cells for autolo-gous transplantation [1]. Peripheral blood cells produce more rapid hematopoietic recovery, thereby leading to reduced costs [2-5]. Furthermore, although follow-up is more limited in the PBSC group than in the BM group, no evidence was found that the use of PBSC was associ-ated with an increased risk of chronic GVHD compared to results with BM [6]. 2. CHARACTERIZATION OF HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELLS Hematopoietic stem cells are normally found in very limited numbers in the peripheral circulation (less than 0.1% of all nucleated cells). It is logical that progenitor cells circulate in the periphery, as this ensures an even distribution of hematopoiesis within the BM [7]. CD34 antigen expression is used as a surrogate marker for he- matopoietic stem cells and enumeration of CD34 + cells has been used to quantify progenitor and stem cell con-tent [8]. PBSCs represent a subpopulation of all CD34 + cells (CD34+/CD38-) found in the circulation [9]. CD34+ cell viability was measured by an established flow cytomet- ric method [10]. The method is based on triple staining with anti-CD34-PE, anti-CD45-FITC, and the viability marker 7-actinomycin D, and it allows the calculation of the absolute numbers of viable CD34 + cells. Recently, a new rapid and accurate method has been developed for the viability evaluation based on luminometry [11]. 3. CRYOPRESERVATION AND THAWING OF PBPCS PBPCs are usually harvested and stored in liquid N 2 un- til reinfusion. Storage at this low temperature will block all enzymatic pathways and metabolism in the cell [12]. Cryopreservative(s) must be added to the PBSC before freezing in order to protect the cells. The concentration of the cryoprotectant and the rate at which the cells are frozen are the main factors g overning the survival of the cells. Thereafter the cells are stored in liquid N 2 [13]. Due to their different cell membrane composition and higher osmotic inactive volume, CD34+ cells are better protected from hypertonic shock and ice crystal forma- tion and should be more resistant to cryopreservation damage than the remaining nucleated cell population [14]. A computer-controlled freezer is used for the cryo- preservation. In order to en sure rate-controlled freezing an optimized program is developed and adjusted ac- cordingly. In controlled rate freezing, th e concentrated stem cells are frozen down at a rate of 1-20C/min up to a tempera-V. Katsares et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 519-527 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 520 ture point of about -40 C. Then, the freezing process down to a target of -120 C is performed at a faster pace, about 3-5 C/min. For PBSCs the controlled rate freezing process is considered standard [15,16], and was in dif- ferent reports found to be superior to uncontrolled freezing approaches. This pr ocedure is time consuming and requires staff with a sp ecific expertise. Hence, the use of uncontrolled rate freezing in which the specimen is first cooled down to -4 C and then directly deposited into a freezer at -80 C or put into liquid phase nitrogen has been evaluated. Several reports [17-19] established that the uncontrolled method is safe and reveals compa-rable results to the controlled rate process for PBSCs. A controlled study performed by Perez-Oteyza et al . [20] showed that the controlled and uncontrolled rate freezing approach are comparable in terms of viability testing and that only a statistically significant decrease in the CFU- GM clonality assay could be detected in the uncontrolled freezing situation. Recent st udies suggested that uncon- trolled freezing is also a viable approach for UCB stem cells [21,22]. As a cryoprotectant, a solution containing 50% DMSO in HAES-steril\u00ae 10% is used. Prior to freezing, a part of pre-cooled cryosolution (with 50% DMSO) is mixed with three parts of the buffy coat (pre-cooled), to achieve DMSO concentration of 5 or 10% in the final solution. Cryopreservation is then ca rried out in aliquots in cryo- genic vials. Current protocols for cryopreservation of PBPCs are usually based on the use of 10 percent DMSO in the freezing medium [23]. HPCs can be preserved with 5% DMSO, and such autografts ca n be safely used for stem cell rescue even after long-term nitrogen storage [24]. Several techniques for the thawing procedure have been proposed. The standard method is warming in a water bath at 37 C until all ice crystals disappear [19]. A German study compared the thawing of cryopreserved units in a warm water bath with dry heat applied by gel pads at 37 C. The viability and clonogenic potential were comparable, with a trend towards less infectious contamination in the dry method [25]. Different studies examined the preservation of function when thawed units were incubated at 0-37 C [19,26]. Akk\u00f6k et al. [25] suggest that even simple single- wash DMSO depletion causes significant CD34 + cell loss. Despite a beneficial impact on the frequency of adverse effects during and af ter stem cell infusion, this time-consuming procedure caused a delayed PLT recov-ery and increased requirement for PLT transfusions. The CD34 + cell loss, however, was never critically low, that is, never lower than 2 \u00d7 106 per kg. They concluded that single manual washing of autografts is a simple and safe procedure that decreases the frequency of adverse events during and after stem cell infusion. The procedure should be recommended especially for patients with an in-creased risk of serious toxicity, for example, patients with cardiac amyloidosis. 4. THERAPEUTIC DOSES OF PBSC Typical doses of CD34+ stem cells used for PBSCs are 2 \u00d7 106 cells/kg of recipient body weight or greater. Doses lower than this threshold is associated with pro-longed cytopenias and increased early mortality [27]. The use of higher doses of CD34 + cells may lead to quicker engraftment, particul arly when doses are greatly increased [28,29]. Platelet re covery appears to be more sensitive to CD34+ doses than neutrophil recovery [29]. Efforts to enrich PBSCT by ex-vivo CD34+ cell selection (positive selection) have resulted in increased rates of GVHD, possibly by altering the cytokine expression patterns of transplanted cells or changing lymphocyte subsets delivered with the graft [30]. Autologous stem cell grafting has been used with varying degrees of success in chronic myelogenous leu-kemia (CML) reported successful autologous pe- ripheral blood stem cell transplantation with a double- conditioning regimen for recurrent hepatoblastoma after liver transplantation. Nevskaya et al . [37] with preliminary results sug- gested the feasibility of therapeutic angiogenesis by lo-cal implantation of CD34 + and MNC from PB for Sys- temic Sclerosis ischemic ulcers. Improved endothelial function, stimulatory circulating endothelial precursors kinetics and augmentation of microcircula-tory blood flow may contribute to therapeutic potential of the implanted cells. 5. COST ANALYSIS The cost method involved two sets of data: a data set including patient-related or direct costs, and a data set including nonpatient-related or indirect costs [38]. The patient-related costs comprise the followings: 1) hospi- talization and basic medical service, including medical and nursing staff; 2) pharmacy and blood products; 3) procedures such as operating theatre, leukapheresis and cryopreservation. On the other hand, the indirect costs comprise the clinical servi ce department costs, for in- stance, radiology, clinical chemistry, pharmacy and the nonclinical service departments such as transportation, housekeeping and kitchen services. A study by Mishra et al. [38] reported a cost analysis using mobilized peripheral blood at 2001 prices and the V. Katsares et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 519-527 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 521521 costs had been recalculated into US$ by using the ex- change rates of 1st January 2001. The mean cost for the mobilization/cryopreservation phase per patient was US$ 6544 (range 5114-7273). The mean cost of high dose chemotherapy followed by hospitalization was US$ 25616 (13978-43277). This amounts to total running costs of US$ 32160 (19092-50550). Taken together, staffing, medication and blood products contributed to 74% of total costs. On average, 53% of total costs com-prised staff costs, ranging from 39 to 76%. Personnel resources varied from one center to another, from US$ 12608 to US$ 26038 per patient. Pharmacy and blood products contributed 16 and 5%, respectively, of the total costs. A study by van Agthoven [39] documented total costs of PBSC transplantation at Euro 33742. The author ap-plied a unit cost method where staff costs accounted for 42% of the transplant cost. This relatively large differ- ence in staff costs between Van Agthoven and Mishra et al. is notable, and may indicate there are cost variations between different countries, for example, related to wages. Van Agthoven [39] reported a remarkably low cost per patient for the stem cell harvesting and cryopre-servation procedures, an average of \u20ac4982, and a blood component cost (during the induction chemotherapy regimen, harvesting and transplantation phase), respec-tively, of \u20ac904, \u20ac376 and \u20ac1680, a total of \u20ac2960. In another study, Ghosh et al. [40] reported a PBSCT cost for patients with plasma cell leukemia that ranged from US$ 20000 to US$ 25000. The major part of the costs related to hospitalization, growth factors, blood products, collection and cryopreservation of PBSC. Hopefully, the use of non mobilized peripheral blood could eliminate the cost, si nce there are no mobilization drugs and no any special equipment required. 6. EX VIVO EXPANSION OF HSC The CD34+ surface antigen, which is a glycoprotein ex- pressed on early progenitor cells is present on less than 0.1% of the mononuclear cells in peripheral blood [41]. Many studies have shown that the minimum acceptable dose of HPCs for successful transplantation ranges be-tween 2 - 5 \u00d7 10 6 CD34+ cells per kg of recipient weight [42]. Furthermore, transplantation of higher doses of CD34 + cells seems to improve haematopoietic recovery and overall survival [43,44]. To try and overcome the problem of low progenitor cell dose, ex vivo expansion of CB-derived cells has been attempted. The true test of this method is whether an expansion technology will be able to provide a reliable, reproducible increase in the number of progenitor cells available from a single unit of CB, resulting in superior rates of engraftment and overall survival in adult patients. A significant hurdle of presently available methods for graft production is the ability to generate an expanded population of committed hematopoietic progenitor cells without compromising the numbers of less differentiated progenitor cells (CD34 + CD38- or functional hematopoietic repopulating cells [45]. In order to consistently achieve an adequate cell dose, the processing methods must minimize cell losses. Each additional manipulation of a cellular product potentially leads to further loss of cells. In most studies, CD34+ cell selection is done before initiating cell culture [46], but the CD34+ cell selection itself is associated with a sub- stantial loss of progenitor cells. This cell loss, which may not be significant for smaller children, may become critical in reaching a suitable dose for transplant in older children and adults [47]. To achieve adequate cell doses, many researcher used different ex vivo expansion protocols, either the tradi-tional way, or using a bioreactor system. Beshlawy et al. [48] used three cytokine combinations, i.e. cell factor alone, IL-3 alone, and both stem cell factor and IL-3. Interleukin-3 enhances the amplification of early and committed progenitor cells without impairing the long-term engraftment of stem cells [49]. Several investigators reported significantly decreased cell viability after cryopreservation [50-51] and attrib- uted this to the effect of thawing and washing to remove the cryoprotectant. Laroche et al. [47] stated that thaw- ing and washing result in loss of cells approaching 20% when compared with pre-fre eze counts, with the wash step responsible for nearly half of this cell loss. However, Beshlawy et al. [48], using umbilical cord blood derived hematopoietic stem cells, detected mean fold expansion of 6.64 \u00b1 3.34 with stem cell factor alone, 7.38 \u00b1 2.86 with both stem cell factor and IL-3, and 8.11 \u00b1 4.49 with IL-3 alone after 2 days culture of the samples frozen for 2 weeks. There were no sta tistically significant differ- ences in fold expansion between the 3 cytokine combi-nations before freezing and after 1 week and 2 weeks of freezing. They concluded th at although preservation procedures could decrease the count and viability of cord blood HSCs, freezing does no t impair their ex vivo ex- pansion potential; however, it results in a significant loss of cell viability. In a similar study, Moezzi et al . [51] used stem cell factor, IL-3, and thrombopoietin and reported levels of expansion of (4.2-4.7 fold) after 7 days of culture of samples cryopreserved for 1 month. It was shown that a combination of early- and late- acting cytokines, including SCF, late (CD34 +) and early (CD34+CD38-) progenitor V. Katsares et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 519-527 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 522 cells, probably due the fact that the late-acting cytokines drive the cultures mainly toward accelerated differentia-tion [52,53]. On the other hand, cultures (SCF, TPO, IL-6 and FLT-3 ligand) resulted in better and prolonged expansion of both late and early progenitors [54], which are important for short-term early trilineage engraftment [55-57]. Peled et al. [58] suggested that TEPA supports the self renewal division cycle without compromising differen-tiation capacity of hematopoietic stem cells. A number of serum-free media have been used over the last few years with different results [59-62]. For ob-taining sufficient numbers of progenitor cells for trans-plant, FCS [63] and autologous plasma [60,61] have been used in clinical expansion protocols. However, Lam et al. [61] suggested that, w ith the appropriate se- rum-free media and cytokines, FCS may be excluded in clinical expansions. On the other hand, human plasma, which may contain factors that promote cell maturation [64,65] is thus unlikely to add significant value to the expansion. It has been reported that MSC constitutively secrete various hematopoietic cytokines, as a feeder layer has been shown to improve ex- pansion of cord blood HSC, inhibit their differentiation, and decrease their rate of apoptosis [66,69-71]. Li et al. [66] demonstrated that bo ne marrow MSC can increase human adult PBSC expansion as compared with culture in the presence of cytokine alone. Conventional culture systems such as T-flasks and gas permeable blood bags are the most widely used devices for expanding hematopoietic cells. However, such static culture systems have several inherent limitations. Firstly, lack of mixing results in concentration gradients for dis-solved oxygen (DO), pH, cytokines and metabolites. Secondly, the environmental conditions in well-plate and T-flask are not readily mon itored or controlled online. Thirdly, static systems requi re repeated changes of cul- ture medium, which significantly increases the risk of contamination. Hence there is an urgent need for devel- oping bioreactors for HSCs expansion, which overcomes the limitation of mass transport, keeps culture parame- ters constant and controls differentiation [72]. Several kinds of bioreactors have been applied in the field of HSCs expansion, including stirred tank bioreac-tor, fixed bed bioreactor and perfusion chamber [73-75]. It is known that hematopoietic cells are extremely sensi- tive to shear force, hence cells may suffer some physical damage under shear environment like in a stirred tank bioreactor and perfusion cham bers [73]. In stirred tank bioreactor, agitation may affect cell surface marker ex- pression, including cytokine receptors, which can have a profound effect on which cells expand and to what ex-tent expansion occurs [73]. A condition with low shear but low concentration gradients is highly desirable for hematopoietic cell expansion [72]. Rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor may provide a technical solution. The RWV bioreactor has several key characteristic features as follo ws [76]: firstly, fluid flow is near solid body and is laminar at most operating con- ditions, which avoids the large shear stresses associated with turbulent flow and allows introduction of controlled and nearly homogenous shear fields; secondly, the cul- ture medium is gently mixed by rotation, avoiding the necessity for stirring vanes, which may damage cells by both local turbulence at their surface and the high flow rates created between the vessel walls and the vanes; thirdly, there is no headsp ace in the RWV bioreactor while in roller bottles, due to incomplete filling of the vessel, the air in the headspace creates turbulence and secondary bubble formation in the culture medium, which are both potent sources of extra shear and turbu- lence; finally, the RWV bioreactor supports coculture efficiently by bringing different cell types of different size and density together simply and efficiently. So by optimizing the geometry of the bioreactor and opera- tional condition, it is possible to provide a uniform and low shear condition within th e bioreactor. At the same time concentration gradient can be minimized. RWV bioreactors have been used to simulate micro- gravity in space flight to study how microgravity affects the hematopoiesis of astronauts [77,78], to proliferate BM cells [79]. The RWV bioreactor can provide a 3D suspension culture environment and all hematopoietic cells are suspended in the culture medium effectively, which overcomes the concentration gradients in T-flasks and makes the utilization of cytokines more effective. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) develope d two RWV bioreactors for tissue mass culture [80]. The slow turn lateral vessel (STLV) bioreactor has been used to culture several kinds of cells both on Earth and in space. The STLV was operated at 15-30 rpm on Earth and slower in space allowing a free-fall state, reducing the sh ear stress. The high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) bioreactor has a similar design, but the rotating speed can be sl ower than STLV . The NASA RWV systems have been used to study the effects of m icrogravity on murine HSC and evaluating the hema- topoietic homeostasis during long space expeditions [81]. The elucidation of mechanisms governing self-renewal and differentiation of HSC is needed to control the in V. Katsares et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 519-527 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 523523 vitro expansion. Results from pilot clinical trials of transplants using expanded UCB-HSC have shown no adverse effects in the patients. However, more clinical trials must be conducted using expanded HSC for guar-antying the safety [82]. Very recently, Delaney et al . (2010) claimed that when cord blood progenitors ex-panded ex vivo in the presence of Notch ligand we in-fused in a clinical setting after a myeloablative prepara-tive regimen for stem cell transplantation, the time to neutrophil recovery was substa ntially shortened. This is the first instance of rapid engraftment derived form ex vivo expanded stem/progenitor cells in humans [83]. 7. AUTHORS' CONTRIBUTION All authors contributed substa ntially to this research.

ABSTRACT Recent advances in neuroimaging contribute a lot to the accurate diagnosis and evaluation of cerebrovascular diseases. To explore the rela- tionship among blood perfusion, metabolism and brain structure integrity, 6 Chinese transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients with middle cere- bral artery (MCA) stenosis were examined by xenon-enhanced magnetic resonance to compare + Cr)/NAA] values and fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the MCA territory. Our results showed that CBF values significantly decreased in the ipsilateral basal ganglion regions in all 5 cases with unilateral MCA stenosis, with a corresponding decrease of FA values in the same region. In conclusion, decreased blood perfusion may indicate nerve fibre damage in the dominating regions of st- enosed arteries. Transient Ischemic Attack; Magnetic Resonance Tomography INTRODUCTION Knowledge on recurrence, optimal evaluation and effect- tive prevention strategy of transient ischemic attack (TIA) is still lacking. An increasing body of evidence has revealed that TIA in Chinese population is more re- lated to intracranial artery stenosis [1]. Recent advances in neuroimaging contribute a lot to the accurate diagno- sis and evaluation of TIA and cerebrovascular stenosis. To address the relation between blood perfusion, struc- ture integrity and metabolism in the brain, we enrolled Chinese TIA patients with mi ddle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis to compare cerebral blood flow (CBF), (choline + creatine)/N-acetyl aspart ate [(Cho + Cr)/NAA] and fractional anisotropy (FA) of MCA territory measure by xenon-enhanced computed tomography (Xe-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 2. SUBJECTS AND METHODS A total of 6 consecutive TIA patients with MCA stenosis detected by TCD and confirmed by MRA, were enrolled to undertake Xe-CT, MRS and DTI examinations 3 days after the most recent attack in the department of radiol- ogy from January to June in 2009. TIA was as previ- ously defined [2]. Study protocol and informed consent were obtained from all participants in the study, which was conducted in accordance with institutional guide- lines. Patients with lacunar infarction in the basal gan- glion of CT or MRI were excluded from this research. All patients had a full clinical assessment, including electrocardiogram (ECG), ca rotid duplex Doppler Ul- trasonography, and mini mental status examination (MMSE) and National Institute s of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). American Nicole t TC8080 TCD machine, German Siemens MAGNETOM Avanto 1.5 T MR ma- chine was used to perform MRI, MRA, DTI and MRS examination, and American Diversified Diagnostic Products Xe-CT CBF system with German Simens PLUS4 CT were used to perform Xe-CT examination. MRI Protocol: MRI scanning, including conventional MR images, including T2-weigh ted, T1-weighted, and J. Wu et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 528-531 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images, MRA, MRS and DTI were performed with the use of a clinical 1.5 T whole-body MR system Siemens MAG- NETOM Avanto with a conventional gradient system (Magnetom Vision, Siemens Medical System). Parame- ters are as follows: TSE/T1WI: TR 400 ms, TE TSE/T2WI: TR 3250 ms, TE 99 ms; Time-of-flight (TOF)-MRA, scanning time 6 01, TR 25 ms, TE 4.6 ms, thickness 0.9 mm, band width 85 Hz; MRS( 1H): two- dimensional MRS of basal ganglion, scanning time 7 12, TR 1500 ms, TE 135 ms, band width 35 Hz; DTI: TR 3900 ms, TE 76 ms; DTI: TR ms, TE 76 ms, ma-trix 64 \u00d7 64, in-plane resolution was 1.875 \u00d7 1.875 mm. Xe-CT protocol: Xe-CT studies used a 28 to 33% concentration of medical-grade xenon gas mixed with O 2. At the start of each study, a face mask was used to de-liver the mixed gas and the patient was closely moni-tored. The procedure used w ithin the DDPI system in- volved obtaining two baseline scans before Xe inhala- tion and six scans during Xe inhalation for each of four axial planes of the brain, each 20 mm thick. CT scanning was performed at intervals of 1 min at the basal ganglial level. The resulting image was shown as a CBF map, on which CBF values could be extracted by placing regions of interest (ROIs) on corresponding brain tissue. The results of TCD and MRA were independent of the patients' clinical manifestations, given by professional TCD and MRI technicians. And the (Cho + Cr)/NAA values, FA values and CBF values of the basal ganglion regions were measured and calculated by three respect- tive professional radiological physicians blinded to the clinical data of the subjects. Results are presented as mean \u00b1 SD. The data of FA and (Cho + Cr)/NAA values were analysed with nonparametric analysis, Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test by software of SPSS 11.5 (for Win-dows OS). And CBF values were analysed with PEMS 3.0 to compare means of two samples. A probability value of < 0.05 was considered significant. 3. RESULTS All 6 subjects were male, aged 55.7 \u00b1 10.3; ECG, carotid duplex Doppler ultrasonography, MMSE and negative results. Average CBF values in bilateral ROIs were different, with the maximum difference of 12.2 ml/(100 g\u00b7min), and the minimum of 1.5 ml/(100 g\u00b7min); CBF values significantly decreased in the ipsi- lateral basal ganglion regions of stenosed MCA in all 5 cases with unilateral MCA stenosis (P < 0.05). ( Table 1 ) FA values in stenosed MCA territory were significantly lower than those in the contra-lateral counterparts in 5 subjects with unilateral MCA stenosis. There was no Table 1.

REPRESENTATIVE CASE A 53-years old male with a history of untreated hyper- tension and diabetes mellitus, presented ictal left hemi- paresis for the first time. Dizziness, vertigo, nausea and dysarthria were absent. TCD suggested a reduced blood flow velocity of right MCA. Stenosed right MCA was confirmed by MRA. Xe-CT showed decreased CBF in the right basal ganglion, with CBF of in the right counterpart ( p < 0.05) FA values in stenosed MCA territory were significantly lower than the counterpart. ( p < 0.05) There was no significant difference between bilat-eral (Cho + Cr) /NAA values ( p > 0.05) (Figure 1 ). 5. DISCUSSION Xe-CT is a quantitative method of CBF analysis, and multiple studies have validated the accuracy of CBF values obtained with Xe-CT [3]. MRS can evaluate the metabolism of brain tissues in vivo [4]. Abnormalities of neuronal structures lead to reductions in NAA quantity [5]. An increase in the Cho p eak is associated with con- ditions such as demyelinating disease and brain tumors [6]. Also alterations in the NAA/Cho ratio have been reported with findings suggestive of neuronal damage caused by neuronal disorders [7]. In theory, the chronic or acute ischemia of brain tissue may result in the changes of (Cho + Cr)/NAA due to axonal degeneration or demyelination secondary to artery stenosis, while in the present study, no significant changes in (Cho + Cr)/ NAA value could be seen. The similar results can be seen in a previous MRS study in TIA without stenosed cerebral artery [8]. One reason may be argued that al- though there is a reduction of CBF in the territory of J.

( p = 0.866). stenosed MCA compared with the contralateral counter- part, the relative ischemia of the brain tissue may not necessarily result in a significant metabolic change. DTI may be used to map and characterize the three-dimen- sional diffusion of water as a function of spatial location. Chronic ischemia of brain is postulated to possibly cause demyelination of white matter, which can result in the reduction of FA values. And our data confirmed such a hypothesis. Although only 6 patients contributed to this study, a preliminary conclusion of the present study may be drawn: local changes of CBF may be used to estimate the integrity of nerve fibres in TIA patients with stenosed MCA. As regards the limitation of our study, the primary one is the small number of the subjects; Secondly, although blind method was used, there still involved subjective deflection in the measurement and calculation of CSF, FA value and (Cho + Cr)/NAA values; Thirdly, the rela- tively low field intensity of 1.5 T MRI is another weak- ness in performing MRS and DTI examination; Also, lactic acid, which can directly reflect the degree of hy- poperfusion and hypoxemia, was not detected.

ABSTRACT Numerous pathophysiologic observations in humans and animals led to the formulation of the response-to-injury hypothesis of atherosc- lerosis, which proposed that endothelial denu- dation by the blood flow was the first step in atherosclerosis. At present it is impossible to describe hemodynamics only by the Navier- Stokes or Oldroyd-B equations because in the large arteries blood flow is unsteady, with the flow separation and waveform propagation of the thyxotropic mass. The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of the arterial pulse wave on the blood flow and initial factors of athero- sclerosis. In 12 healthy men (25-39 years of age) peak velocity, mean velocity, mean flow and net flow in the aorta have been investigated by R angiography. Initial velocity was registered after 43msec of the ECG-R wave, and it differed from zero at all sites of the aorta, although net flow was equal to zero. Womersley's number from the ascending to the thoracic aorta decreased from 12.5 \u00b1 1.5 to 7.3 \u00b1 1. 2; flow modified from inertio-elastic to viscous. In the aortic arch in protodiastole blood flow separated into the opp- osite directed streams resulting in wave super- position with the high net flow. At the isthmus area separated waves interferences and reflects to anterograde direction. Here flow acceleration in protodiastole is 6 times higher than in systole. Pulse waves move on artery walls fifteen or more times more rapidly than the blood flow. Pulse oscillation increases strain rate to the contiguous vessel wall flow layers. At the sites with the flow wave negative interference vessel pulse oscillation attenuates and at the boundary reflection flow wave can shift the vessel wall. Keywords: Arterial Atherosclerosis 1. INTRODUCTION The lesions of atherosclerosis occur principally in large and medium-sized elastic and muscular arteries and can lead to ischemia of the heart, brain, or extremities, re- sulting in infarction [1]. They may be present throughout a person's lifetime. In fact, the earliest type of lesion, the so-called fatty streak, which is common in infants and young children, is a pure inflammatory lesion [2,3]. Local hemodynamic temporal pressure and wall shear stress are important for understanding the mechanisms leading to various complications in cardiovascular func- tion [4]. At present blood motion has been studied as a contin- uum with the steady flow and has been described by the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations arise from applying Newton's second law to fluid motion and are nonlinear partial differential equations [5]. In a real situation blood flow in the large arteries is unsteady, with the flow separation and waveform propagation of the thyxotropic mass. Polymer solutions are convenient for experimental studies of viscoelastic flows. The Couette-Taylor flow is often chosen because of its geometrical simplicity and its diversity of instability modes and turbulent states. The most striking elastic property of the polymer solutions is, probably, the dependence of m echanical stresses in flow on the history of the flow. So, the stresses do not imme- diately become zero when flui d motion stops, but rather decay with some characteristic relaxation time. Equa- tions with the expression of time derivative of the poly- mer stress constitute the Oldroyd-B model of polymer solution rheology [6]. At very small scales or under extreme conditions, real fluids made out of discrete molecules will produce re- sults different from the continuous fluids modeled by the equations cited above. Up today it is impossible to de- scribe blood flow only by the fluid mechanics. Depend- ing on the Knudsen number of the problem, statistical mechanics or possibly even molecular dynamics may be a more appropriate approach. For the complicacy of the problem we are discussing M.

MATHERIALS AND METHODS We have investigated 12 healthy men (25-39 years of age) with a 1.5-T MR imager with the breath hold (18 sec) and ECG triggering in different sites of the aorta. Pulse rate 72 to 78 beats per minute. Kinematic viscosity of the blood 3.8 \u00d7 10 -6 m2/s olunteers angiologist and hematologists. Flow quantifica- tion (mean velocity, peak velocity, mean flow, net flow) was carried out in every 43 s ec at different sites of the ascending aorta, aortic arch and thoracic aorta in 1 mm slices of 7 cm 2 area. All data are given below as graphs. (Figures 1-5 ) Examinations were performed with sur- face coil technology, with a gradient strength 40 mT/m and a maximum slew rate 200 mT/m/msec. 3. RESULTS In our cases the initial flow velocity was registries after 43msec of the ECG-R wave, and it was different from zero at all sites of the aorta, although net flow was equal to zero. During the heart cycle blood systolic velocity varies in sinusoid shape, whereas net flow increases gradually at the diastole when blood velocity was low. Initial flow acceleration was lower than of the next one, although gradient pressure much higher initially and gradually decreased at the flow. Womersley's number from ascending to thoracic aorta decreased from 12.5 \u00b1 1.5 to 7.3 \u00b1 1.2 and flow modified from the inertio-elastic to viscous. Specificity, sensitivity and accuracy of the MRA to the explored area were 95%, 97%, and 96% (Figures 1-5 ). Figure 1.

Blood is non Newtonian [9], thyxotropic [10,11] and as a viscoelastic substance must be expressed in some phe- nomena: 1) If the stress is held constant, the strain increases with the time (creep); 2) If the strain is held constant, the stress decreases with time (relaxation); 3) Effective stiffness depends on the rate of applica- tion of the load; 4) If cyclic loading is applie d, hysteresis (phase lag) occurs, leading to a dissipati on of mechanical energy; 5) Wave experience attenuation; 6) Rebound of the object following an impact is less than 100% [12]. With the viscoelastic hydrocolloids as a blood, some deformation caused by shear stress is elastic and will return to zero when force is removed. The remaining deformation will not return to zero forming creep flow of the substance. Under the constant force elastic dis- placement remains constant whereas the sliding dis- placement increases. If the force varies in sinusoid shape, shear strain rate lags behind the changes in the causative force by the phase. Systolic sinusoid pulse pressure in the vessel wall and inside the blood propagates as a wave [13]. Wave is the disturbance that runs through the space and time, trans- ferring energy, little/no associated with the mass trans- port; instead there are oscillations around almost fixed positions. Within wave, phase of the oscillation is dif- ferent for adjacent points in space because the vibration reaches these points at different times [14]. The mechanical wave in subs tance propagates as elas- tic deformation and velocity shown in phase velocity. Wave phase velocity (v p) is given by the equation: v p = f (-wave length, f-fluctuation frequency). The phase velocity for waves in a medium is determined in part by intrinsic properties of the medium. For all mechanical waves in elastic media, the square of the phase velocity is proportional to the ratio of the appropriate elastic property of the medium to the appropriate inertia prop- erty. Wave velocity within the material is independent of the wave amplitude [15]. When a wave encounters a boundary which is neither rigid (hard) nor free (soft) but instead somewhere in bet- ween, part of the wave is reflected from the boundary and part of the wave is transmitted across the boundary. The exact behavior of reflection and transmission de- pends on the material properties on both sides of the boundary. If a pulse crosses the boundary from a denser medium into a less dense medium, the speed and the wavelength are both increased. The frequency of the incident pulse is the same as the frequency of the transmitted pulse. At the soft boundary, the restoring force is zero and the reflected wave has the same polar- ity (no phase change) as the incident wave [16]. Arterial pulse pressure evaluating in the initial systole, move on arteries and it is not caused by the forward movement of the blood: blood stroke volume forming distension of the medium and pulse pressure propagates through the aorta in waveform by elastic deformation of the vessel wall and the blood [17,18]. Further to elastic, sliding deformation of the blood is accompanying. The large arteries, i.e., aorta, pulmonary artery and their ma- jor branches are referred to elastic arteries because of the presence of relatively large amounts of elastin. The structural features of various segments of the arterial tree have a functional significance in the conversion of dis- continuous ventricular output to a continuous flow in the peripheral circulation. Due to the dispensability of the large arteries and the resistance encountered in the pe- ripheral circulation, a portion of the blood ejected by the ventricle is stored in the large arteries during systole. In diastole stored blood is released, thus maintaining the continuity of peripheral blood flow and preventing ex- cessive fall in arterial pressure [19]. Pulse oscillation in arterial wall increases strain rate to the contiguous wall flow layers. In our cases in image area at the time 0.043 sec initial net flow = 0, mean os- cillation velocity v = 3-5 cm/sec, distance to the wall r = 0.5 cm. Oscillatory strain rate = 6-10 sec -1. Due to vis- cosity/strain rate graph, at the strain rate up to 1 sec-1 blood viscosity sharply (mor e than x30) decreased. The changes in viscosity are a result of modification in arrangement, orientation and stretching of the red blood cells. In the low shear ra te region the cells are en- countered in large aggregates and as the shear rate in- creases, the size of the aggregates diminish. At the mid shear rates, near unit strain internal stress due to pressure is sufficient to separate the aggregated cells causing breakage of aggregates (creep). Increasing shear rate causes the cells to orient in the direction of flow. Above a unit strain, a cell is forced to move past its adjacent neighbour. At the high shear stress rates blood forms layers of stretched and packed red blood cells sliding on layers of plasma. Pulse wave velocity from aorta to small arterial wall is 7-15-35 m/sec. Pressure wave velocity in blood is 6-8 m/sec. Peak flow velocity in aorta is 1.2-1.4 m/sec. [20]. At the identical frequency, wave length to the ves- sel wall and adjoining flow blood slice must be different. Initiation of the strain rate and blood flow is shown on the stream surface and gra dually involves the whole blood mass. So, phase delayed creep flow becomes sim- M.

Here pulse wave oscillation amplitude is high and blood in systole reveals inertio-elastic proper- ties. To the distal pulse wave attenuates and boundary layer enlarges, flow becomes viscous. Blood viscoelastic transformation is one of th e main reasons for the low flow velocity at the high syst olic pressure at the distal arterial tree (Figure 6 ). Blood flow (creep/relaxation) delays to the pressure wave oscillation by the phase. Pressure and flow phase difference in viscoelastic fl ow frequency, -density, -viscosity). It defines relationship between elastic and viscous stress during the pressure oscillation and shows which part of the pipe is occupies by the boundary layer's viscous flow. In the large arter-ies, boundary layer is less than the blood volume pro-vided by the pressure [5]. At the 43 msec. distances propagating by the pressure wave is about 28-60 cm. and covers all of the imaged places. At the ascending aorta Flow is inertio-elasatic. Elas- ticity is promoted by the blood and vessel wall structure. Womerslay's number is 12.5 \u00b1 1.5. In the elastic material phase angle between causative force-pulse pressure and strain rate (blood systolic oscillation) is low ( Figure 7 ). Blood viscous stress exceeds to elastic and pulse energy stored mostly in the substance. In systole blood mostly oscillates; there is no/low creep flow. Creep flow phase delay to pressure is about 85 ; oscillatory (creep) flow amplitude is low. Flow amplitude is characterized by the relation of the maximum volumetric flow rate Qmax (volume of the fluid which passes through a given surface per unit time), to the stationary volumetric flow rate-Qst (flow rate which would be established at the maximum gradient pressure at the Poiseuille's flow) (Figure 7 ). This is main reason for the low initial sys- tolic flow acceleration. Figure 6.

Elastic/viscous stress correlation in the material (above), flow ampl itude (middle-comparable with the net flow) and pressure/flow phase delay (below) at the sinusoidal varying pressure with the increasing Womersley's number- . Blood is thyxotropic and decreases in the apparent viscosity under shearing, followed by a gradual recovery when the shear is removed. The effect is time dependent. In diastole pressure is less pulsating. Pressure exposi- tion time for the viscoelastic creep flow is higher than that for the systole. These correlations are more expr- essed at the distal Here pressure dissipates in blood structural rearrangement. Womerslay's number is 7.3 \u00b1 1.2. In the viscous material phase angle between the causative force - pulse pre ssure and strain rate (creep flow) is high ( Figure 7 ). Flow is more viscous/less iner- tial. Creep flow phase delay to pulse pressure decreases (about 40 ). Flow amplitude and net flow is high. Ratio of mean/net blood flow shows wiscoelastic properties of the local circulatory system. Ratio of the (dynamic) viscous force to the inertial force (fluid density) is char acterized by the kinematic viscosity. Kinematic viscosity with diameter of number. At the lower Womer- sley's number flow profile is parabolic and volumetric flow rate is determined by the instant pressure. Aforesaid is especially importance at the end diastole and to the distal arterial tree. At the aortic arch blood circular movement facilitates flow velocity dispersion. In initial protodiastole blood flow is separated into the opposite flowing streams. Later streams have identical direction (flow recirculat- ion). ( Figure 8 ). In line of our date, protodiastolic and systolic flow waves initially have different frequencies and at the su- perposition do not resist to each other [20]. Wave super- position facilitates to increase strain rate: blood particles at the same time participating in different oscillations. It causes to high net flow at the diastole as shown in graphs and can simplify blood outflow in the different arterial branches. Here stress must be sufficient to caus- ing breakage of the red cell aggregates. ( Figures 1(d)- 5(d)). At the isthmus area (end/ent rance of the circle flow) separating flow waves at 300-400 msec have identical frequencies and phase (antegrade directed waves are formed at the same places of Walsalva sinuses), so they can interfere. ( Figure 3(a) ). Here at the destructive in- terference flow velocity is zero and further sharply in- creases. Flow antero grade acceleration in protodiastole is 6 times higher than in systole. At zero velocity systolic kinetic energy of the blood passes in to potential energy of the vessel wall. Wall elastic stress increases, wall os- cillation basic frequency changes and systolic pulse wave can be attenuates. At the isthmus area flow wave with the high accelera- tion changes position from external to internal wall. Circumstances can be promoted by the presence of the recirculation zones. Wave propagation on the graphs is similar to the wave reflection at the boundaries (Figure 8). Obviously, systolic energy of the heart transforms in space and time by the elastic oscillation and/or viscous sliding of the blood elements. Movement is always in waveform. At the wave destructive interference high elastic stress facilitates initial recirculation at the exter- nal aortic wall. By our dates, in protodiastole blood peak velocity at the external wall is much higher than that of systolic and peak shear stress is about 25 N/m 2. But just before the flow local pressure is much higher than at the flow and is equal to shear stress, it exceeds thresholds of the elas- tic deformation and as the outer slice of the blood is ad- hesive to the wall, forming endothelial denudation. At the place with the high local pr essure flow wave reflects, i.e., wave velocity vector changes in quantity and direc- tion. At the hard boundary restoring force is high and the reflected wave has the different polarity to the incident wave (phase changes). But endothelial layer is not ab- solutely hard and wave can shift the vessel wall. The ground substance, non-cellular components of extracellular matrix fibers in the human body, is thyxot- ropic and acts as a support for the cells. It seems that at the high shear stress to the viscoelastic transformation undergo not only blood cells, but extracellular matrix too. The more so as cholesterol in experimental membranes M.

In atherosclerosis it can be compen- satory reaction of the vessel wall to the increased stress. Flow wave interference with the reflection at the ex- ternal wall also specified to the distal part of the ascend- ing aorta (opposite to isthmus), but flow acceleration is much lower than at the isthmus area. Aortic dissection is characteristic for those areas. It is significant that red blood cell aggregation affects blood viscoelasticity, but shear stress threshold to de- struction of erythrocyte membrane is 6 times higher than for the endothelial sheet and erythrocyte membrane can move around the cell. Pathological data have shown that atherosclerotic change in children and young adults can be correlated with the presen ce of the same factors as it is identified in adults [22]. Circular movement at the arterial bifurcation can be facilitated by the same changes as at the aortic arch. It seems that at the vessel branching sites wave superpose- tion increases net flow, but is fraught with the endothe- lial denudation. Modified arterial pulse can be used as an atherosclerosis prevention factor. To obtain more spe- cific information about the flow physiology in protodi- astole and blood viscoelastic modification during the cardiac cycle, studies must be continued. Author hopes for cooperation with the other institutes. 5. CONCLUSIONS Systolic pulse oscillation in arterial wall increases strain rate to the contiguous wall blood flow layers. At the circular sites flow separation and wave super- position promotes to the blood viscoelastic modification and high net flow in diastole. At the distinct circular area flow wave superposition forms destructive interference. Here wall systolic pulse oscillation attenuates and flow wave reflects. In protodiastole anterograde directed viscous flow re- circulation with the high acc eleration and wave reflec- tion shifts the endothelial layer. M.

ABSTRACT The purpose of the current study was to model the health insurance coverage of Jamaicans; and to identify the determinants, strength and predictive power of the model in order to aid clinicians and other health practitioners in un- derstanding those who have health insurance coverage. This study utilized secondary data taken from the dataset of the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions which was collected between July and October 2002. It was a nationally rep- resentative stratified random sample survey of 25,018 respondents, with 50.7% females and 49.3% males. The data was collected by way of a self-administered questionnaire. The non-re- sponse rate for the survey was 29.7% with 20.5% not responding to particular questions, 9.0% not participating in the survey and another 0.2% being rejected due to data cleaning. The current research extracted 16,118 people 15 years and older from the survey sample of 25,018 respondents in order to model the de-terminants of private health insurance coverage in Jamaica. Data were stored, retrieved and analyzed using SPSS for Windows 15.0. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. Descriptive analysis was used to provide baseline information on the sample, and cross-tabulations were used to examine some non-metric variables. Logistic regression was used to identify, determine and establish those factors that influence private health insurance coverage in Jamaica. This study found that approximately 12% of Jamai-cans had private health insurance coverage, of which the least health insurance was owned by rural residents (7.5%). Using logistic regression, the findings revealed that twelve variables emerged as statistically significant determinants of health insurance coverage in this sample. These variables are social standing (two weal- thiest quintile: OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.30), income (OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 1.00 - 1.00), durable goods (OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.12 - 1.19), marital status (married: OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.61 - 2.42), area of residence (Peri-urban: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.199 - 1.75; OR CI - 2.40), education (secondary: OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.20 - 2.06; tertiary: OR = 9.03, 95% CI = 6.47 - 12.59), social support (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53 - 0.76), crowding (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.28), psychological conditions (negative affec-tive: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94 - 1.00; positive affective: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.16), num- ber of males in household (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77 - 0.93), living arrangements (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41 - 0.92) and retirement benefits (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.03 - 2.35). This study highlighted the need to address preventative care for the wealthiest, rural residents and the fact that social support is crucial to health care, as well as the fact that medical care costs are borne by the extended family and other social groups in which the individual is (or was) a member, which explains the low demand for health insurance in Jamaica. Private health care in Jamaica is substantially determined by af- fordability and education rather than illness, and it is a poor measure of the health care- seeking behaviour of Jamaicans.

INTRODUCTION Literature on private health insurance or health insurance in the Caribbean, and in particular Jamaica, has been substantially on 1) population density- i.e. coverage, 2) coverage offerings, 3) cost of care- i.e. health economics, and 4) acceptance (or lack of) by health service provid-ers of certain insurance coverage. Having extensively perused the literature review on private health insurance and health care reform in Jamaica, it is obvious that no study has been conducted identifying the different fac-tors that explain health insurance coverage in this nation. The individual utilization pattern of health insurance coverage is highly associated over time with older adults [1,2] as they prepare for the degeneration of the body; but, what else do we know about those who have private health insurance in Jamaica? Do insurers attract healthy patients, and are high risk individuals more likely to become insured as against their low risk ( i.e. less health conditions) counterparts? Health insurance is a con-stituent of health seeking behaviour, suggesting that it is equally important in any study of health, quality of life, and wellbeing. In this study the researchers will criti-cally examine factors that can be used to predict private health insurance coverage by using a logistic regression technique to explain the independent effect; and in the process the researchers will i nvestigate the lives of re- spondents in order to understand those who reported having private health insurance coverage. Instead of providing an elaborate and extensive de- scription of 'health insurance', we will give a simplified meaning of this construct. Health insurance is protection against medical costs owing to the possibility of injuries, dysfunctions and other happenings that hinder the body from performing at some functional standard. In keep-ing with this definition, a health insurance policy is the contract that is signed by an insurer ( i.e. insurance pro- vider) and an individual or a group, in which the insurer agrees to pay a specific sum ( i.e. a premium). Hence, the population's health service is partially dependent on health insurance coverage or the welfare system of the state. Jamaica does not have a public health insurance system, but one for the elderly and those who have par- ticular chronic health conditi ons, such as diabetes melli- tus, hypertension, cancer or a combination. In September 2001, the Cabinet of Jamaica accepted and approved a proposal for the establishment of a National Health Fund (NHF) that would assists pati ents as well as the elderly in Jamaicans. The individual benefits of the NHF ( i.e. public health insurance options) for the elderly and for those with particular chronic health conditions was offi- cially commenced in 2003 ( i.e. August 1, 2003), and so there are only data on private health insurance coverage from 1988-2002. Despite the fact that Jamaica has insti- tuted a free health-care serv ice delivery programme for its child population (below 18 years in 2006), the quality of care which is relatively good is still surrounded by a certain socio-psychological milieu as well as inequality in health care offerings in the private versus the public sector. This explains the rationale why some people seek private health care and by ex tension private health in- surance coverage [3] to meet the impending higher medical cost of care [1,4-7] and a particular quality of service-environment, custom er service and length of service. The current study will be examined within the theoretical framework used by Franc, Perronnin, & Pi- erre [8]. 1.1. Theoretical Framework A South African Health Inequalities Survey (SANHIS) carried out in 1994 of 3,489 women ages 16 to 64 years was used to model the determ inants of health insurance coverage. Kirigia et al. , [8] sought to model health in- surance demand among South African women. They used binary logistic regression analyses to estimate health insurance coverage among the sample and various determinants of health insurance coverage. Health in-surance coverage of the sample was determined by socio-demographic characteris tics, health rating, envi- ronment rating, bad health choices ( i.e. smoking and alcohol consumption), and contraceptives. These were embodied in the mathematical formula, Eq. 1 : P ij = ( + 1 Health rating + 2 Environment rating + 3 Residence + 4 Income + 5 Education + 6 Age + 7 Age squared + 8 Race + 9 Household size + 10 Occupation + 11 Employment + 12 Smoking + 13 Alcohol use + 14 Contraceptive use = 15 Marital status + i ( 1 ) where P ij = 1 if individual I owns insurance (j = 1) and equal otherwise (j = 0); is intercept terms; ( 's) are the estimated coefficients; and i is the stochastic error term. The conceptual framework of Kirigia et al. 's work [8] was on two risks of health care. They believed that these risks are (1) the risk of becoming ill, with the associated loss in quality of life, cost of medical care, loss of pro- ductive times, more serious cases, mortality, and (2) the risk of total or incomplete or delayed recovery [8]. This denotes that a person's decisi on to buy health insurance would be based on differentials between the level of expected utility of the insurance and the expected utility without insurance. It is this binary nature dependent variable and the desire to determine the effect of par-ticular independent variables that justified the binary logistic regression technique. Eq. 1 allows for the estimation of the individual probability of having or not having health insurance by some explanatory variables. Kirigia et al. , [8] did not P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 541-550 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 543543 stipulate whether health insurance was public or private coverage, and this was addressed in another research paper. Using the same principle of econometric analysis as Kirigia et al ., a group of researchers used a single multiple regression equation that identified explanatory variables and the powers of particular factors that can be used to determine determinants of those who have pri-vate health insurance [9]. This captures a standard utility theory model of a demand for private health insurance coverage, Eq. 2 : Y = 0 + 1P + 2I + 3Z ( 2 ) where the standard utility theory is expressed in the quantity demanded of health insurance, Y, can be written as a function of the user price of health insurance, P, income, I, and a vector of other factors, Z or (with time subscripts suppressed); and 1 and 2 represent, respec- tively, the price and income elasticity of the demand for private health insurance. Like Kirigia et al. , [8] self-rated private health insur- ance is variable (1= yes and 0= other-wise), which denotes that a logistic regression model will be used to estimate the determinants and determine their impact on the dependent variable, as was done by Ahking, Giaccotto, and Santerre [9]- Eq. 3 . Instead of having a vector factor which envelopes individual char-acteristics, this research is olates those factors including income, unlike Eqs. 1 and 2, and added more variables such as psychological conditions, living arrangements and social support. HI i = (Y i, HC i, En i, MS i, AR i , Ei, SS i, O i, Pi, G i, NP i, PP i, Mi, Fi, Di, EW i , Ai, Ri, YP i, Pmc i, LL i, CR i,) (3) where Eq. 3 is Private Health Insurance coverage, HI i, is a function of Y i is average current income per person in household i; HC i is health conditions of person i; En i is physical environment of person i; MS i is marital status of person i; AR i is area of residence of person i; E i is educa- tional level of person i; SS i is social support of person i; Oi is average occupancy per person i; P i is property ownership of person i; G i is gender per person i; NP i is negative affective psychological conditions per person i; PPi is positive affective psychological conditions per person i; M i is number of males per household per per- son i; F i is number of females per household per person i; Di is the number of children per household per person i; EW i is durable goods; A i is age of person i; R i is retire- ment benefits of person i; YP i is social standing of per- son i; Pmc i is cost of medical care of person i, LL i is living arrangements of person i; and CR i is crowding. The current study found the following determinants of private health insurance of Jamaica ( Eq. 4 ): HIi = (Y i, AR i, MS i, SS i, E i, (NP i, PP i), M i , EW i, i,) ( 4 ) where Eq. 4 is Private Health Insurance Coverage, HI i, is a function of Y i is average current income per person in household i; HC i is health conditions of person i; AR i is area of residence of person i; MS i is marital status of person i; SS i is social support of person i; G i is gender per person i; E i is educational level of person i; NP i is negative affective psychological conditions per person i; PP i is positive affective psychological conditions per person i; EW i is durable goods of person i; D i is the number of children per household per person i; Ri is retirement benefits of person i, YPi is social standing of person i, LL i is living arrangements and CR i is crowd- ing. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Method This study utilized secondary data taken from the dataset of the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions which was collected between July and October 2002. It was a na-tionally representative stratified random sample survey of 25,018 respondents, with 50.7% females (N = 12,675) and 49.3% males (N = 12,332 ). The data was collected by way of an administered questionnaire. The non-re-sponse rate for the survey was 29.7% with 20.5% not responding to particular questions, 9.0% not participat-ing in the survey and another 0.2% being rejected due to data cleaning. The current research extracted a sub- sample of 16,118 people 15 years and older from the survey sample of 25,018 respondents in order to model the determinants of private health insurance coverage in Jamaica. The rationale for the use of the 2002 data set instead of the 2007 is primarily b ecause of the sample popula- tion. In 2002, the institutions that were principally re-sponsible for the data collection used 10% of the na-tional population to gather pertinent data on the labour force, and this was for the Survey of Living Conditions. It represents the largest data collected on the Jamaican population, and data was also collected on crime and victimization and the environment, these being included for the first time, and omitted in subsequent surveys. Given the nature of crime, violence and victimization in the nation, we opted to use a survey that had crime and the environment as among data collected. Another con-dition for the selection of this dataset was the fact that it was a large population, as against other years when the population was less than 3,000. Within the context of a non-response rate that ranges from 10 to 30 per cent, a larger rather than a smaller sample size coupled with some pertinent variables was preferred to a smaller sam-ple size without the two critical aforementioned vari-ables. Data were stored, retrieved and analyzed using P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 541-550 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 544 SPSS for Windows 15.0. A p-value of less than 0.05 was used to establish statistical significance. Descriptive analysis will be done on the sampled population in order to provide background information on the respondents; and the enter method of logistic regression will be used to establish the determinants of self-reported private health insurance in Jamaica. Using the principle of par-simony, the final model will consist of only those statis-tically significant variables. Where multicollinearity existed (r > 0.7), variables were independently entered into the model to aid in determining which one should be retained during the final model construction ( i.e. the de- cision therefore was based on the variable's contribution to the predictive power of the model and the goodness of fit). 2.2. Measure Health conditions: The summation of reported ailments, injuries or illnesses in the last four weeks, which was the survey period; where higher va lues denote greater health conditions; it ranges from 0 to 4 conditions. Health status is a dummy variable, where 1 (good health) = not reporting an ailment or dysfunction or illness in the last four weeks, which was the survey period; 0 (poor health) if there were no self-repor ted ailments, injuries or ill- nesses. While self-reported ill-health is not an ideal in-dicator of actual health conditions as people may un-der-report their health condition, it is still an accurate proxy of ill-health and mortality. Household crowding: This is the average number of persons living in a room. Physical Environment: This is the number of responses from people who indicated suffering landsides; property damage due to rains, flooding or soil erosion. Psycho-logical conditions are the psychological state of an indi-vidual, sub-divided into positive and negative affective psychological conditions. 18-19 Positive affective psy-chological condition signifies the number of responses with regard to being hopeful and optimistic about the future and life generally. Negative affective psychologi-cal condition means number of responses from a person on having lost a breadwinner and/or family member, loss of property, being made redundant, or failing to meet household and other obligations. Income is proxied by total individual expenditure in USD. During the survey period, United States $1.00 was equivalent to Jamaican $50.97. Average income ( i.e. per person per household) is total expenditure divided by the number of persons in the household. Age: The number of years lived, which is also referred to age at last birthday. This is a continuous variable, ranging from 15 to 99 years. Age group is classifi ed into three categories. These are young adults (ages 15 to 30 years), middle aged adults (ages 31 to 59 years) and the elderly (ages 60 + years). Retirement benefits were measured by those who recei- ved retirement inco me. Private Health Insur- ance Coverage: This is a dummy variable, where 1 de-notes self- reported ownership of private health insur-ance coverage and 0 is otherwise. Durable goods: This variable is the summation of the self-reported durable goods owned by an individual ex-cluding houses, buildings and property. where D i 28 i 1EW D i ranges from 1 to 28, where higher values denote greater ownership of durable goods. Living arrangements are a dummy variable where, 1 = living alone, 0 = living with family members or relative. Social support (or network) denotes different social networks with which the individual has been or is in-volved (1 = membership of and/or visits to civic organi-zations or having friends that visit one's home or with whom one is able to network, 0 = otherwise). Crime: n ij i1Crime Indexi = K T where K i represents the frequenc y with which an indi- vidual has witnessed or experienced a crime, where i denotes 0, 1 and 2, in which 0 indicates not witnessing or experiencing a crime, 1 m eans witnessing 1 to 2, and 2 symbolizes seeing 3 or more crimes. T j denotes the degree of the different typologies of crime witnessed or experienced by an individual (where j = 1...4, where 1 = valuables stolen, 2 = attacked with or without a weapon, 3 = threatened with a gun, and 4 = sexually assaulted or raped. The summation of the frequency of crime by the degree of the incident ranges from 0 and a maximum of 51. Social standing is proxied by per capita population quintile (from poorest-to-wealthiest) 3. RESULTS 3.1. Demographic Characteristics of Sample The sample was 16,619 respondents ( i.e. 48.6% males and 51.4% females; with 39.2% young adults, 42.7% middle aged adults and 18.1% elderly). Some 25.8% of the sample resided in peri-urban areas; 60.2% in rural zones; 14.0% were from urban areas; 16.8% were below the poverty line ( i.e. poorest 20%); while 18.2% were just above the poverty line compared to 21.2% in the wealthy quintile and 24.1% in the wealthiest 20%. Of the sample, 97.6% responded to the health status ques-tion. Of those who responded to the health status ques-tion, 80.6% indicated at l east good health and 19.4% poor health. Ninety-seven percentage points of the sam-P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 541-550 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 545545 ple (n = 16,118) responded to the health insurance cov- erage question, of that 11.9% revealed having health insurance coverage. Based on Table 1 , poverty is substantially a rural phe- nomenon. The findings reveal ed that 21.2% of rural residents were below the poverty line ( i.e. poorest 20%) compared to 10.7% of peri-urban dwellers and 9.5% of urban settlers. Health insurance was greatest among ur-ban residents: Some 20.8% of urban dwellers had health insurance compared to 17.6% for peri-urban settlers and 7.5% of rural residents. A significant statistical differ-ence was found between area of residence and crime, and income in this sample. Peri-urban residents spent the most statistically on medical care (USD 39.16 \u00b1 USD 85.77, 95% CI: USD 61.47, 95% CI: USD 54.15, USD 26.58 - USD 32.06) (Table 1 ) On examination of the cross tabulation between good health status and social sta nding, a statistical correlation was found ( P = 0.001) ( Table 2 ). Table 2 showed that the worst health was reported by those in the wealthiest quintile (21.8%), the poorest (19.9%), the poor (18.6%) and so on. There is a positive statisti cal correlation between age- ing and self-reported poor health (or health conditions) of Jamaicans (P = 0.001) ( Table 3 ). Further examination of Table 3 revealed that 10.3% of young adults reported poor health compared to 17.4% of middle aged adults and 43.6% of the elderly Table 1.

These variables are social standing (two wealthiest quintiles: OR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.23 - 2.30), income (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 1.00 - 1.00), durable goods (OR=1.16, 95% CI = 1.12 - 1.19), marital status (married: OR=1.97, 95% CI = 1.61 - 2.42), area of residence (Peri-urban: OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.199 - 1.749; OR CI - 2.402), education (secondary: OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.20 - 2.06; tertiary: OR = 9.03, 95% CI = 6.47 - 12.59), so-cial support (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.53 - 0.76), crowd-ing (OR = 1.14, 95% CI = 1.02 - 1.28), psychological conditions (negative affective: OR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.94 - 1.00; positive affective: OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06 - 1.16), number of males in household (OR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.77 - 0.93), living arrangements (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.41 - 0.92) and retirement benefits (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.03 - 2.35). The model [ Eq. 4 ] had statistically significant predic- tive power (model 2 = 1604.389, P = 0.001; Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness of fit 2 = 5.280, P = 0.727), and correctly classified 91.3% of the sample (Correct classi- fication of cases of reported health insurance coverage = 32.0% and correct classification of cases with no insur-ance coverage = 98.3%). 4. DISCUSSION This study found that health insurance coverage is influ- enced by social standing, dur able goods, income, marital status, area of residence, education, social support, crowding, psychological conditions, retirement benefits, living arrangements and the number of males in the household, and that those with good health are more likely to purchase health insurance than those with poor health. Continuing, rural residents, elderly and poorest, are the least likely to purchase health insurance coverage in Jamaica. In the literature, it is well documented that the major- ity of uninsured workers in South Dakota were either employed or self-employed [6]. The poor, elderly and many rural residents are more likely to be employed on a seasonal basis in the informal sector, and these occupa- tions and employment types do not have private health insurance, suggesting a further rationale for why unem- ployed people within a particular socio-economic status would be less likely to be holders of health insurance coverage. In this study, it was revealed that more unin- sured Jamaicans were poor, elderly and from rural zones, and these were the ones most likely to be unemployed in Jamaica. The current study wa s not able to validate the direct claim of employability of the uninsured, but the elderly can indirectly validate the literature that more unemployed people do not have health insurance. In ad- dition to the aforementioned fact, another finding was that poor health is associated with low income, owing to P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 541-550 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

This research disagrees w ith the literature that the poor have lower health stat uses, suggesting that they have more health-related conditions than the wealthy. The rich engage in highly involved particular lifestyle practices that expose them to health hazards, and this is not equally comparable to th e poor environment of the poor, justifying why they reported the least health status. Pacione [10] has shown that the quality of the physical environment affects the quality of life (or health or wellbeing) of people, but that lifestyle behavioural prac-tices play a significant role in determining one's health [11] like the physical milieu. [12,13] Moreover, the high cost of health care is a deterrent for the poor to have health insurance coverage; [6] and we concur with the literature as we found a positive statistical association between self-rated health insurance coverage and income. However, in this study we have refined the income vari-able, as there is a ceiling to income and its relation with the purchase of health coverage in Jamaica. The current work has revealed that those in the wealthy-to-wealthiest quintiles were twice as likely to purchase health insur-ance coverage as the poor-to-poorest people. Within the context that those in the wealthiest quintile purchased the most health insurance and indicated the lowest health status, it can be inferred that the purchase of health in- surance is in keeping with their life style and the per- ceived role of income in buyi ng good health, as against preventative behaviour. Health insurance coverage is an elderly phenomenon, [6] and this work does not concur with the literature. The argument put forward is that younger people are health-ier, and so do not see the need to invest in health cover-age, as the risk of becoming ill is low, hence the will-ingness to engage in risky behaviour compared to their older counterparts, [6] suggesting that the futuristic end for health insurance coverage becomes even more criti-cal after 30 years when more people will have families, as well as the fact that the purchase of health insurance may materialize owing to futuristic changes in the eco-nomic circumstances of the individual. There is a statistical relationship between socioeco- nomic conditions and the health status of Barbadians, which is not the case in Jamaica. A study by Hambleton et al. , [11] of elderly Barbadians revealed that 5.2% of the variation in reported health status was explained by the traditional determinants of health. Furthermore, when this was controlled for current experiences, the percentage fell to 3.2% (a drop of 2%). When the current set of socioeconomic conditions was used, they ac-counted for some 4.1% of the variation in health status, while 7.1% were due to lifestyle practices compared to 33.5% which were as a result of current diseases. [11] Despite this fact, it is obvious from the data that there are other indicators which explain health status; people do not necessarily pay attention to this fact although they may have more income or access to more economic re-sources. This explains the rationale for more health con-ditions being reported by the wealthiest as well as the group that purchased the most health insurance, where the thinking is that money can buy health. A study published in the Caribbean Food and Nutri- tion Institute on the elderly in the Caribbean found that 70% of individuals who were patients within different typologies of health services were senior citizens. [14-16] Among the many issues that th e research reported on are the five major causes of morbidity and mortality, taken from the Caribbean Epidemiology Centre, which are of paramount importance to this discussion, and their in-fluence on the elderly\u2014cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, neoplasm, diabetes, hypertension and acute respiratory infection\u2014and these dysfunctions are highly costly to treat. It should be noted that many of these dysfunctions are owing to lifestyle behaviour. Hence, the purchase of private health insurance coverage by these people when they become old and approach retirement is in keeping with the cost of health care and the high likelihood of becoming ill. Eldemire, [17] on the other hand, opined that the eld- erly are not as sick as some people are making them out to be-\"The majority of Jamaican older persons are physically and mentally well and living in family units\" [17]; but the fact is they are preparing for the eventuality of health conditions owing to the principle of the degen-eration of the body with the onset of old age. Eldemire is somewhat right. The current study found that for every 1 young adult who reported poor health, there were ap-proximately 2 middle aged adults and 4 elderly persons. Simply put, there were elderly people with poorer health than other age cohorts; but of the elderly, more of them indicated good health status (56.4%). The mere fact of living longer (life expectancy post retirement is at least 15 years), suggests that the aged population will require more for medical care if they become ill. [18] With age-ing the issue is not if they become ill but when. A group of scholars found that there is a direct association between ageing and health conditions, [19] a concept with which this study concurs. And this provides the explanation for the purchase of private health insurance more than other age cohorts, because they are at a dif- ferent stage from other age cohorts in a population. Health conditions are crucia l to the purchase of pri- mary health insurance coverage, and this is highlighted by ageing. Eldemire's works [17,18] have shown that ageing in an individual does not translate to high physi-P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 541-550 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 549549 cal impairments, but that with ageing come particular changes in the profile of dysfunctions-Alzheimer's dis-ease, dementia, cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, neo-plasm, diabetes, hypertension and acute respiratory in- fection. [20] A study conducted by Costa [21], using secondary data drawn from the records of the Union Army (UA) pension programme that covered some 85% of all UA, shows that there is an association between chronic conditions and functional limitation-which in-cludes difficulty walking and bending, blindness in at least one eye and deafness [21]. Among the significant findings is-(i) the predictability between congestive heart failure in men and functional limitation ( i.e. walk- ing and bending). Although Costa's study was on men, this applies equally to women, as biological ageing re-duces physical functioning, and so any chronic ailment will only further add to the difficulties of movement of the aged, be it man or woman. One study has contra-dicted the works of Eldemire , and it showed that a large percentage of the elderly suffer from at least one health condition. Women are more involved in health seeking behaviour, compared to their male counterparts, [22] irrespective of the age factor, and this is owing to the cultural back-ground in which they live. Unlike women, across the world men have a reluctance to 'seek health-care' com-pared to their female counterparts. It follows in truth that women have bought themselves additional years in their younger years, and it is a pr actice that they continue throughout their lifetime which makes the gap in age differential what it is-approxi mately a 4-year differential in Jamaica. In keeping with the preventative care ap- proach to health care, it would be expected that women would purchase more health insurance coverage than them, but this is not the case in Jamaica as gender was not a predictor of health status. However, the more men in a household, the less an individual will purchase health insurance coverage. The Planning Institute of Jamaica in collaboration with the Statistical Institute of Jamaica has shown that while the general health status is commendable, chronic illnesses are undoubtedly eroding the quality of life en- joyed by people who are 65 years and older [23,24]. The JSLC report reveals that the prevalence of recurrent (chronic) diseases is highest among individuals 65 years and over. [23] The findings show that in 2000, the prevalence of self-reported illn ess/injury for people aged 65 years and over was 41.7%, for those 60 to 64 years it was 27.6% compared to 19.8% for children less than five years old. However, the prevalence of self-reported illness/injury for those 50 to 59 years was 18.8%. Some 36.6% of individuals 65 years and over reported inju- ries/illnesses in 2002 which is a 5.6% reduction in self-reported prevalence of illnesses/injuries over 2000, but the self-reported prevalence of illness/injuries rose by 25.8% to 62.4% in 2004. [25,26] It should be noted here that this increase in self-reported cases of inju- ries/ailments does not repres ent an increase in the inci- dence of cases, as according to the JSLC for 2004,the proportion of recurring/chronic cases fell from 49.2% in 2002 to 38.2% in 2004 [26]. In addition, the PIOJ and STATIN [23] in (JSLC 2000) opined that individuals 60-64 years of age were 1.5 times more likely to report an injury than children less th an five years of age, and the figure was even higher fo r those 64 years of age and older (2.5 times more). In this paper, the findings con-curred with the literature that health conditions are sig- nificantly greater; but other issues account for them not demanding more health insurance coverage than middle age adults. This is reinforced in the findings that showed that people who received retirement benefits were ap-proximately twice as likely to purchase health insurance coverage as those who did not receive any retirement benefits. Embedded in this finding is the fact that health insurance is a matter of affordability and education, and not illness, which justifies why rural residents had the lowest health insurance coverage, yet still the poorest 20% good health status was gr eater than that of those in the wealthiest 20%. Statistics revealed that poverty in 2007 for the nation was 9.9%, and rural poverty was 15.3% compared to 4% in peri-urban and 6.2% in urban areas [27], accounting for the lowest private health in- surance coverage in that group. 5. CONCLUSIONS In summary, married Jamai cans are more likely to pur- chase health insurance coverage compared to those who were never married, with urban residents being more likely to purchase health insurance than rural dwellers. An individual who has attained tertiary level education was more likely to purchase health insurance than one with at most primary level education, and those who lived alone were less likely to purchase health insurance coverage than those who dwelled with relatives or fam- ily members. Moreover the wealthiest were more likely to purchase health insurance, but were less healthy, and this indicates that income does not buy good health. Therefore, this study highlighted the need to address preventative care for the wealthiest, and the fact that social support is crucial to health care, along with the fact that medical care cost s are borne by the extended family and other social groups in which the individual is (or was) a member, which explains the low demand for health insurance in Jamaica.

ABSTRACT A group training was conducted on 17 college students to improve their career decision-making self-efficacy (CDMSE). The result showed that there was significant difference between the pre-test and the post-test for the experimental group (n = 17), whereas no significant difference was found between the pre-test and the post- test for the control group (n = 17). In the pre-test, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group, and obvious difference between the two groups was found in the post-test. This indicated that the group training was effective on improving the CDMSE of the college students whose scores of CDMSE were below 27% point of the total is the specific application of self-e fficacy theory in the domain of career studies. Based on Bandura's self-efficacy the-ory and Crites's career maturity theory, Taylor and Betz define CDMSE as the extent to which individuals' be-lieve that they can evaluate themselves, collect career information, select goals, make plans, and resolve prob-lems relevant to career decision-making [1]. It has been found that CDMSE is of great importance to individuals career development. Individuals with higher level of CDMSE tend to be more active and positive in career decision-making, while individuals with lower level of CDMSE tend to be more passive and negative when choosing careers [2-4]. With the reform of college students' employment sys- tem in China in late 1990s, college graduates have to make their career choices by themselves, instead of wait-ing to be distributed by the government. In this situation, students are likely to feel confused and dazed and think that they are not capable of selecting a suitable career for themselves. Under many occasions, many graduates with lower CDMSE choose jobs just for the salary or only based on their parents' views, they usually choose some \"hot\" jobs beyond their abilities, interests and work val- ues and exclude jobs that are actually in consistent with their abilities and interests. Career decisions made in this way are not mature and often lead to individuals' unsat- isfaction with their jobs and other negative emotions, and result in a negative impact on their career develop-ment. In addition, individuals with lower CDMSE usu- ally feel anxious and depressed during their career deci- sion- making and their mental health is negatively af-fected. Therefore, it is urgent and necessary to design intervention which can improve students' decision- making self-efficacy. Group training is a kind of psychological counseling conducted in a group context. Through means of obser- vation, learning and experiencing during interpersonal interaction, group training enables individuals to explore, understand, and accept themselves, improve their inter-personal relationships, acquire new attitudes and behav-ioral styles, and develop good adaptation abilities. Group training has been found to be an effective way to im- prove college students' CDMSE [5-8]. In group training, by using such means as helping group members re-ex-perience previous success, verbal persuasion, overcom-ing the anxiety occurring in career decision-making, providing modeling, and attributional training, counsel- ors assist group members in self-evaluation, career in- formation collection, goal setting, plan making, and so-lution of problems. However, little empirical studies based on the Chinese reality have been conducted on improving college students' CDMSE, which has blocked J. L.Wang et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 551-556 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 552 subsequent studies in the domain of CDMSE. Moreover, existing studies on CDMSE improvement were con-ducted either by teaching students career deci-sion-making skills or by attributional training, seldom studies have combined the two means. As argued by Borkowski, mere emphasis on individuals' effort is not enough, because great effort can not necessarily lead to progress when individuals ar e directed by incorrect cog- nitive strategies, which will decrease individuals' confi-dence [9]. Borkowski's statement has implied the im-portance of both internal attribution and career decision- making skills. Therefore, in this study, we consider the combination of attributional training and skills acquire- ment to improve college students' career decision-making self-efficacy. 2. METHOD 2.1. Participants Students were recruited from the Southwest University in China through poster adve rtising. Career Decision- making Self-efficacy Scale (CDMSE) was the recruited students [10]. Students' scores on CDMSE scale were used as standard to select participants, 17 students whose scores were below 27% point of the total students were randomly selected into the experimental group (female = 12, male = 5), and another 17 students with the same condition were selected into the control group (female = 12, male = 5). No significant difference existed between the two groups on CDMSE. 2.2. Instrument 2.2.1. Career Decision-making Self-efficacy Scale On the basis of Career Decision-making Self-efficacy Scale by Betz and Taylor, according to the interview and open-ended questionnaire, Peng developed this 39 items Career Decision-making Sel f-efficacy Scale, which in- cluded five dimensions: self-evaluation, information collection, goal selection, plan making, and problem solution [10]. The internal consistent coefficients of each dimension were between .68 and .81, the internal con-sistent coefficient of the total scale was .94.The retest reliability of each dimension were between 0.51 and 0.60, the retest reliability of the total scale was 0.66. 2.2.2. Internal verse External Locus of Control Scale Individuals' CDMSE was found to be significantly re- lated with their attributional style, with individuals with internal attribution having higher level of CDMSE while external attribution individuals having lower level of CDMSE. Attribution training has been shown to be effec-tive in improving individuals' CDMSE [11-13]. Hence, in this study, we noticed the important role of positive at-tributional training and used the Internal verse External Locus of Control Scale as an assistant instrument. The Internal verse External Locu s of Control Scale including 29 items in this study was developed by Rotter [14]. The score ranged from 0-23, with higher scores indicting higher level of external locus of control. The internal consistent coefficient was 0.70. 2.3. Intervention Program The design of the intervention program was based on career decision-making self-e fficacy theory by self-efficacy theory [15], attribution theory, and other theories relevant to career were also taken into consideration. The whole interven-tion program can be divided into seven units, with each units owning a specific topic, including 'know about your achievement', 'learn to search career applications'. The group trai ning included the following activities and forms such as brain storm, role play, mod-eling, verbal persuasion, group discussion, and games, etc. During the group training, the experimenter noticed to provide group members with encouragement and di-rection, and to help them form positive attribution style. At the end of each session, the group members were asked to summarize their feelings towards the training. The experimenter created an acceptable and supportive atmosphere. Through group activities and interpersonal interaction, the group members could attempt to feel the positive experience, rebuild rational knowledge relevant to career choice, learn career decision-making skills, change their career-decision style from the improper and immature one to the proper and mature one, which can be used in realistic situation and therefore improve group members' CDMSE. 2.4. Implementation Progress As a first step, assign participants into control group and experimental group. Based on the concrete situation of the experimental group members, we made modifica-tions on the initial intervention program in order to make the intervention more goal-directed and specific. Second, the group training was conducted one session each week, with each session lasting 90 minutes. The participants in the control group received on training. 2.5. Follow up Study The participants in the experimental group were investi-gated again 3 months after the end of CDMSE group training. J.

RESULTS Career Decision-making Self-efficacy Scale and Internal verse External Locus of Control Scale were used in the pre-test and post-test. Data were analyzed with SPSS 12.0 software for Windows XP. The comparison of CDMSE scores on pre-test and post-test between the experimental and control group was made (see Table 1 ). As can be seen from Table 1 , for the participants in the experimental group, the scores on all the dimensions and on the total scale in the post-test were significant higher than scores in the pre-test ( p < 0.001). However, for the control group, except on the plan making dimen- sion, no significant difference was found on other di- mensions and on total score between the pre-test and the post-test ( p > 0.05).In the pre-test, no matter on all the dimensions and on total scale, no significant difference was found between the experimental group and the con- trol group. However, in the post-test, the scores on all dimensions and on total scale in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control groupmembers ( p < 0.001). This indi cated that the ex-perimental group members' CDMSE was significantly improved after the group training. The comparison of locus of control scores on pre-test and post-test between the experimental and control group was made (see Table 2 ). As can be seen from Table 2 , for the experimental group, there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test on scores of locus of control ( p < 0.01), with the post-test scores higher than the pre-test scores. For the control group, no such significant differ-ence was found between the pre-test and the post-test (p > 0.05). In the pre-test, there was no significant differ-ence between the control group and experimental group on the scores of locus of control. But significant differ-ence between the two groups was observed after the group training ( p < 0.001), which indicated that the group training had significantly improved experimental group members' internal locus of control. Three months after the group training, another survey of CDMSE using the same scale was conducted on the experimental group members to check up the sustained effects of the group training. The comparison between the scores obtained immediately after the training and the scores obtained three months later was made in Table 3 . Table 1.

In this study it was found that group training was effective on the improvement of CDMSE and could facilitate individuals' career planning devel- opment. The group members in the experimental group maintained a higher level of CDMSE three months after the group training, showing th e efficiency of this group training. The reasons why the group training could achieve success were due to the following aspects. 4.1. Effective Application of Group Training According to the requirement of group training on the number of group members, 17 students were included in each group, in order to guarantee the interaction among the members and the satisfaction of the different needs of group members. With an atmosphere of ease and safety, group training is a process in which group mem- bers can explore and exchange ideas on the problems they encounter. The group training in this study allowed the group members to discuss problems relevant to ca-reer choosing freely and openly. The group members could get instant reactions, suggestions and directions from both the other group members and the counselors, which enabled them to unders tand, analyze, explore and evaluate themselves more effectively and accurately and to open up their career de velopment according to their own situation [16]. The counselors were aware of the importance of interaction among group members, which guaranteed a two-way communication. The counselors and group members together drafted rules and goals for the group, which were required to be obeyed by all group members. In addition, the counselors noticed the different requirements of di fferent members. When the group members got together, their feeling of loneliness and alienation could be eliminated. Members in this at-mosphere would effectively understand themselves and others and establish their self-confidence. With the in- teraction context and the ease and safety atmosphere, group members were likely to take part in group activi- ties actively, experience the outcomes resulting from their behavior changes, acquire timely feedback from other members and counselors, and then correct their behaviors. Group members lear ned skills on dealing with interpersonal relations and skills on problem solution, obtained related experience, and improved their inter- personal communication abilities. Besides, group train- ing on career planning caused the group members realize J. L.Wang et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 551-556 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 555555 the significance of indi vidual career counseling. 4.2. Intervention Based on Bandura's Self-efficacy Theory Has Guaranteed the Effectiveness As Bandura [15] has pointed out, individuals' self-effi- cacy is affected by such four factors as personal experi- ence, modeling, verbal persuasion and emotion arousing. In the present group traini ng, Bandura's self-efficacy theory was effectively incorporated into the intervention. Counselors allowed group members to recall their past success experience, provided group members with in- stant and positive feedback and encouragement, set modeling for them, applied breath relaxation, muscle relaxation, imagination relaxation techniques to help group members overcome the an xiety they experience in group activities. 4.3. The Comprehensive Application of Various Theories on Career Choosing and Career Development The group training in present study was designed under the direction of relevant theories on career development and career choosing, includin g Holland's career theory, Ginzberg and Super's career development theory, social learning theory by Krumboltz, and social cognitive de-velopment theory [16]. In his career theory, Holland has assumed that most people can be divided into the fol-lowing six types of personalities: realistic type, research type, artistic type, social type, management type and conventional type. He proposes that individuals' career choice should be in consistent with their personality styles. The career development theory by Ginzberg and Super has divided individuals' career development into five stages: growing up stag e, exploration stage, estab- lishment stage, maintenance st age, and declining stage. Ginzberg holds that each stage has its own task and in-dividuals should be well aware which stage they are at, which reflects individuals' career maturity degree. Super believes that career choosing is actually individuals' choosing the way to realize their self-conceptions. Indi-viduals are answering the question \"who am I\" in choosing their careers. The social learning theory by Krumboltz holds that individuals' career choice is influ-enced by individuals' genetic characteristic, environment condition, experience learned in the past, skills acquired in resolving new tasks and new problems, performance standard, and individuals' career values. Social devel-opment theory focuses on individuals' decision-making process, during which five kinds of information proc-essing skills are used, including communication, ana-lyzing, synthesizing, evaluation and execution. When the group training was designed, the theories above were taken into consideration. For instance, in the unit \"un-derstand your interests and abilities\", Holland's career- personality matching theory was applied to help group members understand their career personalities and inter-ests correctly. Ginzberg and Super's theory was em-ployed in this unit to allow group members to answer \"Who am I\" through means of group discussion and brain storm, in order that group members have an accu-rate and through understanding on themselves. 4.4. The Combination of Obtaining Career Decision-making Skills and Attributional Training In previous studies, researchers either focused on the acquirement of career decision-making skills or attribu-tional training to improve individuals' CDMSE [5-8,17]. Self-efficacy is individuals ' perceived abilities to ac- complish certain tasks and is related with individuals' cognition on themselves. Therefore, as a means to change individuals' locus of control, forming positive attribution style through attrubitional training is an im-portant means to help individuals know about their abili-ties properly. However, as a complicated process, career decision- making is affected by multi-aspect factors. Therefore, if only th e lack of effort is attributed as the causes of failure in career decision-making and the skills that are needed during career decision-making are ne-glected, it is very likely that even individuals with posi- tive attribution style are not able to reach a suitable ca-reer choice, which will discourage them and cause them depressed. Based on this c onsideration, Borkowski [9] proposed that only stress on hard working is not enough under many occasions; indivi duals who are lack of cor- rect cognitive strategies will hardly make progress and then frustrate themselves. Therefore, in this study we combined the skills training with the attribution training, which made our intervention effective. 5. LIMITATIONS AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE STUDY In spite of the effective function of group training on improving college students' CDMSE in this study, limi-tations still exist. Only students whose scores were be-low 27% point of the total students were selected for the group training, which had limited the significance of this study. Students with high scores of CDMSE should be included in the future study. In addition, the small num-ber of subjects would great reduce the reliability of the results based on objective interview and questionnaire. We recommend that naturalistic observation method can be used in the future study to further validate the effec-tiveness of group training. J.

CONCLUSIONS Group training can help college students form positive attribution style and improve their CDMSE. Group training on CDMSE has a sustained effect and can be applied to the career counseling in reality. 7.

ABSTRACT Health care workers are responsible for the ex- ecution of the health policy of a nation, yet little if any empirical evidence is there on health, lifestyle, health choices, and health conditions of health care workers in the rural parish of Hanover, Jamaica. The current study examines health, lifestyle and health behaviour among health professional in Hanover. The current study has a sample of 212 respondents. A 26 - item questionnaire was used to collect the data. Data from the questionnaires were coded a nd entered into a micro -computer and analysis done using SPSS for Widows Version 15.0 soft - ware. The Chi-square test was used to test as- sociation between non-metric variables. A p - value < 0.05 (two -tailed) was selected to ind icate statistical significance. It was found that 16.0% of respondents had diabetes mellitus (2.8% of males compared to 19.8% females); 22.6% di sease. percentage points of the sample was overweight, 33.5% obese and 24.1% had a normal weight. Over 15% of nurses and doctors were obese co mpared to 38% of ancillary staffers. Twenty per centage points of respondents consume alcohol on a regular b a- sis; 15.6% do no regular physical exercise, 42.4% add sweetening to their hot beverages, and 4.7% were smokers. There is a need for public health practitioners to formulate a health intervention programme that will target people in Hanover, but also specific groups such as doctors, nurses, administrative, anci llary sta- ffers and technical staffers.

INTRODUCT ION Empirically , it is well established that poverty and illness are positive associated with each other and that 80% of all chronic illnesses were in low -to-middle income countries [1 -3]. Sen [1] encapsulated this well when he stated that low levels of unemployment in the economy is associated with higher levels of capabilities, sugges t- ing that poverty predisposed people to illnesses. The World health organization (WHO) [2] reported that 60% of global mortality is caused by chronic illness and four-fifths of chronic dysfunctions are in low -to-middle income countries. This concurs with Sen's finding that poverty does not only predisposed people to illnesses but that it accounts for premature mortality . In many developing countries, the living standards of low income households could be improved by impro ving health services [4]. The lack of resources available for use by the government of Jamaica to address poverty in a significant way negatively impacts health care. There is a significant statistical correlation between pover ty and illnesses in J amaica [5, 6]. A study by Bourne [5] found: 1) a positive correlation between not seeking medical care and poverty (r 2 = 0.58), 2) a positive corr e- lation between poverty and unemployment (r2 = 0.48), and 3) an inverse correlation between mortality and p o- verty (r2 = 0.51). These findings do not substant iate the findings in the literature of the correlation between pr e- mature mortality and poverty . Despite Bourne's fin dings, the level of poverty in Jamaica was 9.9% in 2007. This was 15.3% in rural areas compared to 6.2% in u rban and 4.0% in peri -urban area [7]. A nother important finding is that rural residents indicated the highest percentage points of illness (17.3%) co mpared to urban (14.1%) and P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010 ) 557-565 Copyright \u00a9 20 10 SciRes . Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org/journal/ HEALTH / 558 peri-urban residents (13.9%). Although premature mortality was empirically not found using the data for Jamaica, the positive correlation between poverty and illness is present and cannot be overlooked as there are public health challenges owing to this reality . Jamaica an English -speaking Caribbean nation is a develop ing country. In 2007, it had a popul a- tion of 2,682,120 people (49.3% males); elderly popu-lation ( i.e., 60+ year old); a crude death rate of 6.4 per 1,000; crude birth rate of 17.0 per 1,000 [8]; income inequality of 0.4 (Gini coefficient); and 71.3% of the poor lived in rural areas [7]. The country is geographical divided into 14 parishes and three counties (Cornwall, Middlesex and Surrey). Cornwall covers the Western belt which includes parishes such as Westmoreland, H a- nover, St. James and St. Elizabeth. Middlesex const itutes the mi ddle proportions of the island with parishes such as Cla rendon and St. Catherine. Surrey comprises the Eastern region with parishes such as Kingston, St. Th o- mas and Portland. Cities accounts for 27.3% of the po p- ulation, peri -urban 30.2% and rural areas, 42.5% in 2007. With 43 out of every 100 Jamaicans resided in rural areas and those areas have 15.3% of the poverty, public health policy makers are concerned about health care and behaviour among rural residents. Hanover has the smallest percent of the nation's population (2.6%\u2014 69,660, in 2007), with one urban centre ( i.e., Lucea) [ 9]. Lucea, the capital of Hanover is home to about 5,951 people. The parish of Hanover therefore is substantially rural, and the people rely on tourism, agr iculture and seasonal employment for their economic livelihood. A l- though Hanover is rural and shares many of the ec o- nomic challenges of rural zones, little if no information is available about heal th, lifestyle practices and health care seeking behaviour of the residents. Since public health agencies relies on research information to make inform decision that can effectively aid in improving the health of a population, then it follows that pertinent in- formation is needed on residents of Hanover in order to enhance pu blic health capability on the parish. Most if not all the health information on Hanover is from the Ministry of Health (MOH) which only produce standard curative statistics ( i.e., health service utilization; mortal- ity; health care expenditure; health care resources; mo r- bidity) [ 10-12]. The findings from this study will add value to the existing literature by examining health i n- formation on persons in the parish. This was done by exami ning health, lifestyle and health behaviour among health pr ofessional in Hanover in order to understanding choices, decision and health among its residents, with the purpose of aiding policy formulation and health i n- tervention programmes for the parish. 2. MATE RIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Sample, S ampling Methods and S etting We selected a representative sample of people from H a- nover's health institutions, which had sufficient num - bers to represent the people of the parish. The MOH in Jamaica sub -divided the country i nto 4 regional admini s- trative authorities (RHAs): the South Western (WRHA). The NERHA covers four parishes \u2014Hanover, Westmoreland, St. James and Trelawny. Another class i- fication of the island is statistica l one based on Enum e- ration Districts (EDs). The Planning Institute of J amaica (PIOJ) and Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STA TIN) used Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) as its sampling frame from which it design surveys of the national po p- ulation [7]. A PSU i s an ED or a composition of EDs, usually consisting of 100 dwellings in a rural area and 150 dwellings in urban areas [7]. STA TIN fu rther refined required dwellings by stating that up to 400 households constituted a PSU [ 9]. The EDs are independent ge o- graphical units which share common boun - daries with contiguous EDs. In keeping with a sa mpling error of \u00b1 3% and a confidence interval of 95%, the calculated population for selection was 280 respo ndents. In another survey , the researchers used 36 persons per ED to calc u- late a representative sample of the nation [ 13,14]. H a- nover has 4 PSUs, which means that using 36 persons per ED the sample should be 144. Hence, based on pr e- vious surveys, the current study is sufficient to genera l- ize on the parish because it i s has represent ative sample size [ 13,14]. The current sample of 212 respondents represents 0.3% of the population of the parish of H a- nover (in 2007; n = 69,660). For this study, the sa mple was stratified by area of work, area of residence, and a Kish Random Selection Method of sub -sampling was used to select the actual respondents thereby facil itating independence of response [1 5]. On occasions when an individual was selected and could not partic ipate, no other person was used to replace the individual. In cases where the selected person was not available a minimum of three call -back visits would be made to that person's place of work. The response rate was 75.7%, of which 1.3% of the data were lost during data cleaning. This is in keeping with surveys condu cted by PIOJ and STATIN [7], and . [14]. For the survey study 77.8% of the sample was female, which is similar to that reported by Wilks et al . [14] in which the female sample was 75.9%. 2.2. Questionnaire R eliability P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010 ) 557-565 Copyright \u00a9 20 10 SciRes . Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org/journal/ HEALTH / 559 559 Test-retest reliability o f the questionnaire was conducted for a month (i.e. , February 2008) prior to the main study. The instrument was vetted by academics from the Un i- versity of the West Indies, Mona, Jamaica. Then 20 res- pondents who were non-participants ( i.e., health profe s- sional in Westmoreland Health Services) in the main study were interviewed on two separate occasions a p- proximately 7 days apart. The reliabilities were deter-mined by the percentage of agreement. Modifications were made to the final instrument based on the rec om- mendations, queries and issues raised by the participants in order to attain clarity and conciseness of questions. A 26 -item questionnaire was used to collect the data. The instrument was sub -divided into general dem o- graphic profile of the sample; family history; health seeking behaviour; chronic illnesses, perception on prostate examination and choice of method in prostate examination. 2.3. Measure Regional Health Authorities: Decentralization of public health c are the shifted the central government (i.e., MOH) into four semi -autonomous regional bodies: South -East, North -East, Western, and Southern. Standardized instruments were used to record partici- pant's weight (in kilograms) and height (in squared m e- tres). The body mass index (BMI) is the weight in k g divided by height in m 2. The classification of the World Health Organization was used in this study. The BMI was classified as normal, overweight and obese. Normal BMI is defined as 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.99 and BMI is defined as 30.00 kg/m2. Risky behaviour denotes unhealthy health choi ces such as smoking, alcohol consumption, infrequent exercise, poor dietary habit and food choices. The participants' health status was measured using BMI categorization. Technical staffers includ e trained personnel such as dental nurses, health educators, nutritionists and public health inspectors, contact investigators, pharmacists, and lab technicians. The technical support staff comprises community health -aides, psychiatric aides, ward assistan ts, porters, mosquito spray men and community peer educators. Admi nistrative staffers constitute administrator, parish manager, personnel officer, and matron. The administr a- tive support staff comprises accountants, security pe r- sonnel, medical records officers, secretaries, drivers, telephone operators; cashiers and clerks. The ancillary staffers are cleaners, cooks and gardeners. 2.4. Data Analysis The data were double entered using SPSS, verified and cleaned. Data was stored, retrieved and analyzed, using SPSS for Windows (16.0) . Percentages were used to provide background information on demographic ch a- racteristics on sample, knowledge of prostate and self - reported information on prostate. Chi -square tests were utilized to examine whether statistical associations e x- isted between non -metric dependent and independent variables. A p -value of 5% (i.e., 95% confidence interval) will be used to determine statistical associations between variables. 2.5. Ethics This study sought and was granted ethical approval by the University of the West Indies, Mona, Ethics Co m- mittee. All participants gave written consent, and they were informed of procedures and the choice of wit h- drawal at any time convenient to them if they so desire. The data received from the participants is reported b elow. 3. RESULTS A sample of 212 respondents was interviewed for this study: females, 77.8%; blacks, 90%; single, 46.7%; te education, 39.8%; full-time employed, 86.8%; religious, 97.6%; nurses and doctors comprised of 22.3% of the sample ( Tab le 1 ). Forty-seven percentage points of the sample were Seventh Day Adventist and Pent e- costal members; 42.5% were overweight, 33.5% obese and 24.1% had a normal weight. In Tab le 2 which reports information on particular self-reported diagnosed health conditions, 16.0% of re s- pondents heart and 0.5% ischemic heart disease. In Tab le 3 which reports information on the lifestyle behaviour of responde nts, 20.3% of respondents co n- sumed alcohol on a regular basis; 15.6% do no regular physical exercise, 42.4% add sweetening to their hot beverages, and 4.7% were smokers. A significant statistical relationship exists between BMI categorisation and occupatio n of the persons in the study ( P < 0.01). Just over 15% of nurses and medical doctors were obese compared to 38.2% of ancillary sta f- fers ( Table 4 ). In Tab le 5 , of the 178 respondents who indicated that they do some form of physical acti vity per week over t he survey period, 52.3% spent at least one hour on the activity. Of the different typology of occup a- tion, technical support staff had the lowest pe rcentage points of engagement for at least one hour (20.0%); with administrative support staff recorded the g reatest e n- gagement of 1 hour or more in physical acti vity (63.5%).

Disaggregated the smoker cohort revealed that 57.1% consumed b e- tween 1 to 9 cigarettes per day, and that males were more likely to be smoker s (57.1%) than females (42.9%). Significant more males regularly consume alcohol (12.6%) than females (9.1%) (P < 0.0001). However, more females (47.9%) than males (13.3%) indicated that they were regularly engaged in physical activities (or exercise). The age cohort that indicated the most en- gagement in physical activity was 60+ year olds (67.1%). Of the 60+ year olds who are engaged in regular phys i- cal activities, 13.7% indicated that they do so every day over the survey period. The percentage of other age co-horts and their engagement in physical activities were 50 to 59 years (59.1%); 30 to 39 years (56.5%) and 40 to 49 years (54.5%). Of the 34.2% who indicated sitting watching telev i- sion or reading as their leisure activities, 65% did this on a daily basis and 18% between 4 to 6 times per week. Furthermore, 43% of overweight respondents were e n- gaged in sitting and watching television or reading as their leisure activities compared to 32% of those who were obese. Concurrently, 17% of females were engaged in sitting and watching television or reading as their le i- sure activities compared to 8.3% of males. Forty -three percent of overweight respondents were 40 - 49 years old and 24.1% of the obese were in this age cohort. Of the respondents who indicated being on a sp ecial dietary programme (23%), 35.4% gain and 6.2% were on low cholesterol programme. Health care workers in Hanover prefer to consume fried meats, and this was mostly higher among those younger than 20 years (50.0%) followed by those 50-59 years (49.0%) and those 40-49 years (31.3%) as 6, .26083 \u00a9 20 10 SciRes .

Twenty five pe r- cent of the same had fruit juice (17.5% had it 2-3 times daily; 11.3% had it occasionally), and 49.5% had soda (57.1% had it occasionally; 14.3% daily and 1.9% 6 days per week). Twenty nine percent had vegetables daily, 23% 2 -3 times per week and 0.5% never had vegetables. On general health care-seeking behaviour, 28% of female respondents indicated having visited a health care provider in the last 6 months for breast examination. There was no significant statistical associatio n between breast examination an d occupation (P > 0.05); BMI (P > 0.05) and health conditions (P > 0.05). The majority of the females had done a pap smear (75%). Of those who indicated that they had not done a pap smear, the highest were among administrativ e staff (42.9%) fo llowed by other technical staff (35.7%); administrative support staff (31.2%) and the least by technical support staff (12.2%). Forty percent of female have not done a breast examination compared to 62.9% of males who had never had a rect al examination. A significant relationship e x- isted between rectal examination and occup ational type (P < 0.0001). The percentage points of males who had never done a rectal examination by occup ational type can be disaggregated as technical support staff, 87.5%; administrative support staff, 60.1%; other technical staff, 55.6%. Furthermore, the highest number of males who had not done a rectal examination was among those 50 to 59 years old (69.2%). 4. DISCUSSIONS This study examined the lifestyle, health and the use of health care services of some health care workers in the parish of Hanover, Jamaica. Generally, the health status of people who are employed to health institutions in Hanover is good, but when this was disaggregated into occupational types more information was revealed that indicated worrying signs for health care in the future. Using BMI categorisation to measure health status, the findings revealed that 34% of employees were classified as having normal weight, 43% overweight and 24% ob- ese. Apar t had diabetes mellitus, 22.6% hypertension, 0.5% breast ca n- cer, 0.5% stomach cancer, 1.9% enlarged heart and 0.5% ischemic heart disease. Concurrently, 22% of men had done a rectal examination for prostate cancer, 60% of women had done a breast examination, 77% indicated that they eat every and/or anything, 42% added swe e- tening to their hot beverage, 5% were smokers and 16% do no physical activities and 34% indicated that their leisure time was spent sitting watching television and/or reading. The disaggregation of BMI by occupation r e- vealed that most doctors and nurses were at least over-weight (73%); other technical staff (54%); technical support staff (71%) and those in the ancillary categoriz a- tion were most likely to be in the overweight category (79%). In 2007, statistics from the PIOJ and STA TIN [ 7] re- vealed that 12% of Jamaicans had diabetes mellitus and 22% had hypertension. On disaggregating the figures, 8% of males had diabetes mellitus compared to 14% of females, and 16% of males had hypertension compared to 27% of females. Although 1.3 times more people in the current study had diabetes mellitus compared to the P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010 ) 557-565 Copyright \u00a9 20 10 SciRes . Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org/journal/ HEALTH / 563 563 population, disaggregating the figures by sexes revealed a remarkable difference. In the current s tudy diabetes mellitus disparity between the sexes was 7.1 times (males, 2.8%; females, 19.8%) compared to 1.8 times in the national survey . With respect to hype rtension, there was no difference between the percentage of those with diabetes in the country and health workers in Hanover. There are no available statistics on diabetes mellitus and hypertension by occupational type in the literature, and therefore the findings from this study provides this va l- uable information. The findings showed that hyperte n- sion was not greater among females than males; but it was also highest among those 31 -45 years and among technical support as well as ancillary staffers. Both tec h- nical support and ancillary staffers are among the poor, which concurs with the literature tha t poverty is ass o- ciated with more illness as concur by the findings of this study [2,15-17]. This study highlighted that there was no statistical as- sociation between gender and BMI categorization, ho w- ever one existed for BMI and self -reported dia gnosed health condition. Low socioeconomic status is empir i- cally established as having more people with ill ness, but the current study further shows that they were more likely to be obese than those who are more likely to be in the middle -to-upper class. The study a lso r evealed that 34% of those in the technical support staff and 38% of those in ancillary staff category were obese and these persons are in the low socioeconomic status compared to 16% of medical doctors and nurse who are mi d- dle-to -upper class individuals. Despite this finding, it can be inferred that the schedules of medical doctors and nurses in addition to their and lifestyle may account for a significant percent of them being at least overweight. This has implications for the future of the health sec tors as overweight and obesity are associated with increased risk of morbidities and mortalities. The sedentary lifestyle of health care professionals in Hanover may lead to a public health problem which may become worse in the future if not addressed. The health behaviour of the persons in the study is also a cause for concern and although their lifestyle is a sede ntary one, they make more unhealthy lifestyle choices than healthy ones. It is clear from the findings that education, knowledge of health and health care are not i nfluencing the decision of health care providers in Hanover. The findings concur with a study which showed that non-communicable diseases are largely apart of the lif e- style of Jamaicans, and that 50% of deaths were owing to non -communic able diseases such as heart, stroke, diabe tes mellitus, cancers and obesity [ 18]. A study in by O'Connell and Gray [19] found that four -fifths of those with stroke had high blood pressure when they were taken to hospital for treatment post -stroke, and that two-thirds of them had a history of hypertension. A later study by Woo et al . [8] found that untreated hyperte n- sion was a significant risk of hemorrhagic stroke (i.e. , OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.3, 5.2; P < 0.0001), and that treated hypertension was significant ly lower in causing hemorrhagic (OR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.0 to 1.9; P = 0.03). The WHO revealed that obesity was associated with health problems such as respiratory difficulties, chronic musculoskeletal problems, skin problems and infertility [20], indicating the pending public health challenge in the health sectors in Hanover. In 2000, the Jamaica Lifestyle Survey revealed that 8% of Jamaican had diabetes mellitus (96.1% of males and 9.1% of females) and that the most cases were among the elderly (i.e. , 60 + years) [21], which reiterate the health problem challenge that Hanover faces and speaks to the role of culture and low socioeconomic st a- tus influencing the healthy lifestyle choices of res idents in Hanover. Morrison [22] in an article entitled 'Diabetes and hypertension: Twin Trouble' showed that diabetes mellitus and hypertension have now become the two major chronic non-communicable diseases thus health problems for Jamaicans and in the wider Cari bbean. This finding was also corroborated by Callender [23] who found that there is a positive association between d i- abetic and hypertensive patients ( i.e., 50% of individuals with diabetes had a history of hypertension), which e m- phasizes the public health problem of u nhealthy health workers in Hanover. When the s edentary lifestyle, unhealthy lifestyle choices, and low socioeconomic status are coupled with the fact that the sample is relatively middle -aged to old (i.e., mean age was 41.0 years), it was observed that with the increased risk of morbidities and disabilities ass o- ciated with ageing, the health of individuals in this study becomes exacerbated by the unhealthy diet, alcohol consumption, lack of exercise and sedentary lifestyle. While the prevalence of smokers among residents and health workers in Hanover ( 4.7%) are lower than the national figures (17.7%), the percentage points of male smokers in this was 2.3 times more than the prevalence in the national (24.8%) and this was 5.9 times more fe-males in this sample compared to the national figures (7.1%). The fact that the majority in each category of health care workers are obese is a worrying finding. Instructing patients to take care of their health in an environment where healthcare workers are overweight including nurses and medical doctors may cause patie nts to ignore the information they receive from health care staff. There is an area for future research. Another area for future research should be an examination of the reasons P. A. Bourne et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010 ) 557-565 Copyright \u00a9 20 10 SciRes . Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org/journal/ HEALTH / 564 why some health care workers particularly the profes- sionals who have years of education, knowledge, expe- rience and training become engaged in unhealthy lif e- style practices. Once the reasons for the poor lifestyle choices of health care workers that affect their health are understood, further research is necessary on the content and procedures that are required for a strategic and ef- fective national health literacy communication pr o- gramme. This programme should be cognizant of the fact that education and knowledge about health does not automatically influence the educated knowledge ho lde rs' behavior in a positive way. There is also need for r e- search on how training and wellness programme for health care workers on the job including medical doctors and nurses would influence the choices they make about their health. 5. CONCLUSIONS The current study has revealed pertinent information on the perception of health care workers about healthy lif e- style, health choices and general perception of residents in Hanover on their health. Smoking, obesity, ove r- weight, high cholesterol, sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy lifestyle practices and low socioeconomic status i n- creased the risk of cardiovascular diseases in health workers in Hanover and this is further complicated by hypertension, diabetes mellitus and unhealthy choices. The level of health educa tion is greater among health workers than non- health care workers which indicate that the pending health problems in Hanover would have been understated by the current study . There is a need for public health practitioners to formulate a health inter- ventio n programme that will target people in Hanover including specific groups such as medical doctors, nurses, administrative, ancillary staffers and technical staffers in health care institution in the parish of Hanover. Clearly education and knowledge of heal th do not lead to better and healthier choices by health care workers in Hanover, and this could be a general social dilemma as the general populace may be left to use home remedy if premature mortality were to befall those high risk health workers in Hano ver. Then, there is reality of an increase burden of health care workers in Hanover on the health care services in the future, which would increase health care expenditure for the country .

ABSTRACT Objective Uterine leiomyoma is not a rare path- ological condition in pregnant women; thus the aim of the study was to evaluate the recent progress in the treatment of these pregnant women on the basis of the association of leio-myoma in pregnancy (LP) with pregnancy com- plications and birth outcomes including struc- tural birth defects, i.e. congenital abnormalities (CA) in the offspring. Design Cases with CA and matched controls without CA in the popula- tion-based Hungarian Case-Control Surveillan- ce System of Congenital Abnormalities (HCC SCA) were evaluated. Only women with pro- spectively and medically recorded LP in prena- tal maternity logbook and medically recorded birth outcomes (gestational age, birth weight, CA) were included to the study. Setting the HCCSCA, 1980-1996 contained 22,843 cases with CA and 38,151 matched controls without CA. Population Hungarian pregnant women and their informative offspring: live births, stillbirths and prenatally diagnosed malformed fetuses. Methods Comparison of birth outcomes of ca- ses with matched controls and pregnancy com- plications of pregnant women with or without LP. Main outcome measures Pregnancy complica-tions, mean gestational age at delivery and birth weight, rate of preterm birth, low birthweight, CA. Results A total of 34 (0.15%) cases had mothers with LP compared to 71 (0.19%) con- trols. There was a higher incidence of threat- ened abortion, placental disorders, mainly ab-ruption placentae and anaemia in mothers with LP. There was no significantly higher rate of preterm birth in the newborns of women with LP but their mean birth weight was higher and it associated with a higher rate of large birth-weight newborns. A higher risk of total CA was not found in cases born to mothers with LP (adjusted OR with 95% CI = 0.7, 0.5-1.1), the spe- cified groups of CAs were also assessed versus controls, but a higher occurrence of women with LP was not revealed in any CA group. Con- clusions Women with LP have a higher risk of threatened abortion, placental disorders and anaemia, but a higher rate of adverse birth outcomes including CAs was not found in their offspring. Keywords: Uterine Leiomyoma in Pregnant Uterine leiomyoma (fibroid) is benign, smooth muscle tumour and most common non cancerous neoplasm in women of child-bearing age. Though the onset of uterine leiomyoma is increasing with advanced maternal age, this pathological condition occurs in pregnant women as well and because leiomyoma tends to grow under the influence of estrogens, 15-30% of leiomyoma may enlarge during the first trimester of pregnancy [1]. Com-pressive effect of leiomyoma may distort the intrauterine cavity and alter the endometrium thus after conception may interfere implantation, placental development and the growth of the conceptus mechanically [2]. In addi- tion and contrac- tility secondary to rapid fibroid growth. Thus the direct mechanical effect and indire ct alteration in oxytocinase activity may disrupt the normal progression of uterus and development of the fetu s, therefore uterine leio-F.

Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 567567 myoma is a cause of pregnancy loss, fetal malpresenta- tion, intrauterine growth retardation and premature la-bour [3]. However, most studies of pregnancy complications and birth outcomes in uterine leiomyoma patients were composed of participants from only one hospital or clinic [4-7] and the results of population-based studies have been published only recently [8-9]. The objective of our study was the evaluati on the possible association between maternal uterine leiomyoma in pregnancy (LP) and pregnancy complications, in addition adverse birth outcomes, particularly structural birth defects, i.e. con- genital abnormalities (CAs) in the population-based data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Con-genital Abnormalities (HCCSCA) [10]. 2. MATERIALS The protocol of the HCCSCA included five steps. The first step was the selection of cases from the data set of the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry (HCAR), 1980-1996 [11] for the HCCSCA. Notification of CAs is compulsory for physicians from the birth until the end of first postnatal year to the HCAR. Most cases with CA are reported by obstetricians and paediatricians. In Hun- gary practically all deliveries take place in inpatient ob-stetric clinics and the birth attendants are obstetricians. Paediatricians are working in the neonatal units of inpa- obstetric clinics, or in various inpatient and outpa-tient paediatric clinics. Autopsy was mandatory for all infant deaths and common in stillborn fetuses during the study period. Pathologists sent a copy of the autopsy report to the HCAR if defects were identified in still- births and infant deaths. Since 1984 fetal defects diag- nosed in prenatal diagnostic centres with or without ter- mination of pregnancy have also been included into the HCAR. Isolated minor anomalies (e.g., umbilical hernia, small haemangioma, hydrocele) were recorded but not evaluated in the HCAR. The to tal (birth + fetal) preva- lence of cases with CA diagnosed from the second tri- mester of pregnancy through the age of one year was 35 per 1000 informative offspring (liveborn infants, still- born fetuses and electively terminated malformed fetuses) in the HCAR, 1980-1996, and about 90% of major CAs were recorded in the HCAR during the 17 years of the study period [12]. There were three exclusion cr iteria at the selection of cases with CAs from the HCAR for the data set of the HCCSCA. 1) Cases reported after three months of birth or pregnancy termination were excluded. The longer time between birth or pregnancy termination and data collection decreases the accuracy of information about pregnancy history. This group of excluding cases in-volved 33% of cases and most had mild CAs. 2) Three mild CAs (such as congenital dislocation of hip based on Ortolani click, congenital inguinal hernia, and large haemangioma), and 3) CA-syndromes caused major mutant genes or chromosomal aberrations with precon-ceptional ( i.e. non teratogenic) origin were also ex- cluded. The second step was to ascertain appropriate controls from the National Birth Registry of the Central Statisti-cal Office for the HCCSCA. Co ntrols were defined as newborn infants without CA. In most years two controls were matched to every case according to sex, birth week, and district of parents' residence. 3. DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION The third step was to obtain the necessary maternal, particularly exposure data from three sources: 3.1. Prospective Medically Recorded Data Mothers were asked in an explanatory letter to send us the prenatal maternity logbook and other medical re- cords particularly discharge summaries concerning their diseases during the study pregnancy and their child's CA. Prenatal care was mandatory for pregnant women in Hungary (if somebody did not visit prenatal care clinic, she did not receive a maternity grant and leave), thus nearly 100% of pregnant women visited prenatal care clinics, on average 7 times in their pregnancies. The first visit was between the 6th and 12th gestational week. The task of obstetricians was to record all pregnancy com-plications, maternal diseases and related drug prescrip-tions in the prenatal maternity logbook. 3.2. Retrospective Self-Reported Maternal Information A structured questionnaire along with a list of medicinal products (drugs and pregnancy supplements) and dis-eases, plus a printed informed consent form were also mailed to the mothers immediately after the selection of cases and controls. The questionnaire requested informa-tion on pregnancy complications and maternal diseases, on medicinal products taken during pregnancy according to gestational months, and on family history of CAs. To standardize the answers, mothers were asked to read the enclosed lists of medicinal products and diseases as a memory aid before they filled in the questionnaire. We also asked mothers to give a signature for informed con-sent form which permitted us to record the name and address of cases both in th e HCCSCA and in the HCAR. The mean \u00b1 S.D. time elapsed between the birth or pregnancy termination and the return of the \"information F. B\u00e1nhidy et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 566-574 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 568 package\" (questionnaire, l ogbook, discharge summary, and informed consent form) in our prepaid envelope was 3.5 \u00b1 1.2 and 5.2 \u00b1 2.9 months in the case and control groups, respectively 3.3. Supplementary Data Collection Regional nurses were asked to visit all non-respondent case mothers at home and to help mothers to fill-in the same questionnaire used in the HCCSCA, to evaluate the available medical records, to obtain data regarding life- style (smoking, drinking, illicit drug use) through per-sonal interview of mothers and her close relatives living together and to ask mothers to sign informed consent. Regional nurses visited only 200 non-respondent control and 600 other control mothers as part of two validation studies [13,14] using the same methods as in non-re- spondent case mothers because the committee on ethics considered this follow-up to be disturbing to the parents of all healthy children. Overall, the necessary information was available on 96.3% of cases (84.4% from reply to the mailing, 11.9% from the nurse visit) and 83.0% of the controls (81.3% from reply, 1.7% from visit). Informed consent form was signed by 98% of mothers, names and addresses were deleted in the rest 2%. The procedure of data collection in the HCCSCA was changed in 1997 such that regional nurses visited and questioned all cases and controls, however, these data have not been validated until now, thus only the data set of 17 years between 1980 and 1996 is evaluated here. The fourth step at the evaluation of cases and controls in the HCCSCA is the definition of exposure and to de-termine its diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis of LP was based on the personal manual and ultrasound examina- tion of pregnant women by obstetrician. In general the size of uterine leiomyoma and their types (intramural, subserosal, submucosal, pedunculated, etc) was given in the prenatal maternity logbook but unfortunately these data were not copied out. Pregnant women with dys- functional uterine bleeding, endometrial polyp, endome- triosis, etc were excl uded from the study. Gestational time was calculated from the first day of the last menstrual period. Beyond birth weight (g) and gestational age at delivery (wk), the rate of low birth-weight (< 2500 g) and large birth weight (4000 or more g) newborns, in addition the rate of preterm births (< 37 weeks) and postterm birth (42 or more weeks) were analyzed on the basis of discharge summaries of inpa- tient obstetric clinics. The critical period of most major CAs is in the second and/or third gestational month. Drug treatments and folic acid/multivitamin supple- ments were also evaluated. The latter may indicate the level of pregnancy care, and indirectly may show the socio-economic status and th e motivation of mothers to prepare and/or to achieve a healthy baby. In addition it is necessary to consider folic acid and folic acid-containing multivitamins in the evaluation of preventable CAs [15-18]. Other potential confounding factors included maternal age, birth order, marital and employment stat- us which had a good correlation with the level of educa- tion and income, thus was regarded at the indicator of socioeconomic status [19], and high fever related dis- eases such as influenza. We used SAS version 8.02 (SAS Institute Ins., Cary, North Carolina, USA) for statis tical analyses as the fifth step of the HCCSCA. The occurrence of LP was com-pared in the two study groups and the crude odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calcu- lated. Contingency tables were prepared for the main study variables. The prevalence of other maternal dis- eases, drug intakes and pregnancy supplements used during pregnancy were compared between the group of case and control mothers with LP. We compared the prevalence of LP during the study pregnancy in specific CA groups including at leas t 2 cases with the frequency of LP in their all matched control pairs. Crude and ad-justed OR with 95% CI were evaluated in conditional logistic regression models. We examined confounding variables by comparing the OR for LP in the models with and without inclusion of the potential confounding variables. Finally, maternal age (< 20 yr, 20-29 yr, and 30 yr or more), birth order (first delivery or one or more previous deliveries), employment status, influenza- common cold (yes/no), and use of folic acid supplement (yes/no) were included in the models as potential con- founders. 4. RESULTS As it appeared at the preliminary evaluation of LP, two groups could be differentiated: 1) prospectively and medically recorded LP in the prenatal maternity logbook, and 2) LP based on retrospective maternal information in the questionnaire. However, the diagnosis of leiomyoma can be frequently questioned without medical record in the latter group and in general it was not possible to dif-ferentiate the leiomyoma with myomectomy before the study pregnancy. Thus, only the first group, i.e. medi- cally recorded LP was evaluated. The case group consisted of 22,843 malformed new- borns or fetuses (\"informative offspring\"), of whom 39 (0.15%) had mothers with medically recorded leio- myoma during the study pregnancy. However, of these 39 pregnant women, 5 (12.8%) had previous myomec-tomy due to leiomyoma. The total number of births in Hungary was 2,146,574 during the study period between F. B\u00e1nhidy et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 566-574 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 569569 1980 and 1996. Thus the 38,151 controls represented 1.8% of all Hungarian births, and among those controls, 82 were born to mothers with medically recorded leio- myoma. Of these 82 control mothers, 11 (13.4%) had previous myomectomy. Our objective was to evaluate the possible association of leiomyoma during the study pregnancy with pregnancy complications and adverse birth outcomes, therefore 34 case mothers (0.15%) and 71 control mothers (0.19%) with leiomyoma, i.e. LP were evaluated. Surgical intervention due to LP during the study pregnancy was not recorded in the prenatal maternity logbook and in the discharge summaries of these 105 pregnant women with LP. The number of pregnant women with previous myomectomy of leio- myoma was too small, thus these pregnant women were excluded from this analysis. Of 34 case mothers, 30 (88.2%), while of 71 control mothers, 60 (84.5%) had diagnosed LP in the first visit of prenatal maternity clinic, thus the onset of this patho- logical condition was before conception. The so-called new-onset LP occurred in 4 case mothers and 11 control mothers diagnosed after the fourth gestational month. Table 1 summarizes the charact eristics of mothers with and without LP as refe rence. This comparison indi- cates a much higher mean maternal age (due to the larger proportion of women with the age group of 30 and more years) in women with LP. However, the mean birth order was only higher in control mothers with LP, but some- what lower in case mothers with LP than case mothers without LP. Mean pregnancy order (previous birth + recorded miscarriages) was al so evaluated, and the dif- ference between birth and pregnancy order was some-what higher in pregnant women with LP in both case mothers and control mothers and these data may indicate a higher rate of miscarriages in previous pregnancies. The proportion of unmarried pregnant women was larger in the groups of LP, while LP was more frequently re- corded in the prenatal maternity logbooks of profes- sional pregnant women. In the group of case mothers, the proportion of managerial women was also larger. Among pregnancy supplements (Table 1 ), the use of folic acid and iron was similar between mothers with or without LP, but these supplements were used more fre- quently by control mothers. However, medicinal prod- ucts containing calcium were used more frequently by mothers with LP, and a much hi gher rate of case mothers were treated with vitamin E. Of 2,640 case mothers visited at home, only 4 had LP and one was smoker during the study pregnancy. Of 2,636 mothers without LP, 576 (21.9%) smoked. Of 800 control mothers visited at home, 152 (19.0%) smoked during the study pregnancy. Acute maternal diseases (e.g. influenza) did not occur more frequently in mothers with LP. Among chronic diseases, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and epi-lepsy was similar in the study groups, but essential hy- pertension (19.0% 95% CI: 3.9, 1.9-8.1) were more frequent in 105 women with LP than in 60,889 mothers without LP. The incidences of pregnancy complications are shown in Table 2 , because they were different in case and con- trol mothers with LP. Thre atened placentae) and anaemia oc- curred more frequently in case mothers with LP than in case mothers without LP. However, LP did not associate with a higher rate of thr eatened abortion, placental dis- orders and anaemia in control mothers. Thus LP and fetal defects may have some causal association with the higher risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as placental disorders. Unexp ectedly the incidence of threatened preterm delivery was not significantly higher in case and control mothers with LP. There was some difference in the distribution and fre- quency of drugs used by mothers with LP explained by the higher use of antihypertensive (methyldopa, metop- rolol, nifedipine) drugs (12. 4% vs. 2.6%) the usual treatment of threatened abortion with allylestrenol (21.0% vs. 14.5%) and diazepam (25.7% vs. 11.3%) in Hungary. In addition the use of hydroxyprogesterone (5.7% vs. 1.2%) and human chorionic gonadotropin (2.9% vs. 0.3%) was more frequent in 105 pregnant women with LP than in 60,889 pregnant women without LP. Birth outcomes are shown in case and control new- borns ( Table 3 ) but statistical testing was used only in controls because CAs may have a more drastic effect for these variables in cases than LP itself. (There was no difference in the sex ratio of the study groups, and twin did not occur among newborns of mothers with LP.) The mean gestational age at deliv ery was somewhat (0.1 wk in cases and 0.2 wk in controls) longer, the rate of pre- term birth was higher in controls but lower in cases. There was no difference in the rate of postterm births among study groups. However, these differences were not significant. The mean birth weight was 159 and 95 g larger in cases and controls of mothers with LP and these differences were significant. However, these differences were not reflected in the rate of low birthweight new- borns because there was no difference in their rates be-tween cases and controls born to mother with or without LP. There was a higher proportion of large birthweight newborns of both cases and controls but this difference was significant only in cas es (OR with 95% CI: 3.0, 1.9-7.2). F.

DISCUSSION We examined the possible association between LP and pregnancy complications, in addition birth outcomes. The previously found higher risk of threatened abortion and placental disorders partic ularly abruption placentae was found [4-6,8,20], but this risk was significant only in the mothers of cases with CA, but not in the mothers of controls without CA in our study. Birth outcomes showed controversial pattern: the previously reported somewhat higher rate of preterm birth was confirmed (e.g. [9]), but only in controls without CA and this in-crease was not significant. On the other hand, there was a larger mean birth weight of cases and controls born to mothers with LP, but it does not associate with a lower risk of low birthweight. In fact cases had a higher rate of large birthweight. There was no higher risk of total and any CA group. The secondary findings of the study confirmed the well-known fact that LP is more frequent in elder preg- nant women (e.g. [8]). The advance maternal age may explain the higher prevalence of essential hypertension, haemorrhoids and constipatio n. Previously the higher rate of anaemia (mostly iron deficiency) in women with LP due to abnormal menstruation and haemorrhoids (frequently with bleeding) was not frequently mentioned. However, it is worth mentioning that these associations achieved the significant level only in case mothers thus this study suggests that case mothers with LP ( i.e. having a malformed fetus) had a higher risk of pregnancy com-plications. The higher mean maternal age did not associate with a higher mean birth order, and the difference between birth and pregnancy order was somewhat larger in women with LP likely due to the higher rate of previous miscar- riages [21]. The high use of vitamin E (particularly in case moth- ers), human chorionic gonadotropin and hydroxypro-gesterone may indicate some infertility problem in women affected with leiomyoma. The prevalence of LP ranged from 0.1-3.9% in previ- ous epidemiological studies [4,6,20,22,23], while this prevalence was 0.15-0.19% in our study, i.e. near to the lower level of this range. A similar lower prevalence (0.37%) was found in another population-based material [8]. Of course, the prevalence is determined by the age distribution of women and the diagnostic criteria, in ad-dition underreporting might occur if a woman did not have a sonographic examination, or the diagnosis was F. B\u00e1nhidy et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 566-574 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 573573 not reported in the prenatal maternity logbook. The unexpected finding of th e study is the larger mean birth weight, and a somewhat higher rate of large birth- weight newborns of pregnant women with LP. Coronado et al. [8] reported a higher rate of low birthweight new- borns and prolonged labor. Our data were not appropri- ate to evaluate the latter, but newborns had larger birth weight. Women with LP had a better socioeconomic status but this confounder wa s considered at the calcula- tion of adjusted mean birth weight. Obviously these pregnant women at high risk had also a special prenatal medical management but it did not associate with a higher level of folic acid supplementation. Thus further studies are needed to check the efficacy of recent medi- cal management of women with LP and to explain some unexpected findings in this study. The strengths of the HCCSCA are that is a popula- tion-based and large data set including 105 women with prospectively and medically recorded LP in prenatal maternity logbook, furthermore medically recorded ges-tational age at delivery and birth weight in an ethnically homogeneous Hungarian (Caucasian) population. Addi- tional strengths include the matching of cases to controls without CAs; available data for potential confounders, and finally that the diagnosis of medically reported CAs was checked in the HCAR [11] and later modified, if necessary, on the basis of recent medical examination within the HCCSCA [10]. However, this data set also has limitations. 1) There is underreporting of LP in our data set. 2) The occurrence of previous surgical and other medical management in women with leiomyoma was not checked in validation studies, only the medically reco rded data in the prenatal maternity logbook were evaluated 3) The size of LP was not recorded thus there was no chance to estimate the dose-effect relation. 4) The occurrence of previous mis-carriages could be estimated only on the basis of differ- ence of birth and pregnancy order in the data set of the HCCSCA, in addition the higher risk of women with LP was supported by the higher rate of vitamin E and hy- droxyprogesterone treatment. 5) The lifestyle data were known only in the subsamples of pregnant women vis-ited at home because previous validation study indicated the unreliability of maternal information regarding their smoking and drinking habit [24]. In conclusion, a higher occu rrence of threatened abor- tion and placental disorders was found in the mothers of cases with CA, but not in the mothers of controls with-out CA. There was larger mean birth weight of babies born to mothers with LP and it associated with a higher rate of large birthweight in cases. A higher risk of CAs was not found among the offspring of pregnant women with LP. Thus the pregnancy of women with uterine leiomyoma does not to be discouraged if they wish to have babies, but they need specific and high medical care. REFERENCES [1] Stewart, E.A.

ABSTRACT This cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the knowledge and health seeking be-havior for malaria among the local inhabitants in an endemic area of Ethiopia: Implications for control. 98.6% and 80.7% of respondents had awareness about malaria and the cause ('mos- quito bite') of malaria, respectively. 186 (81.6%) respondents seek treatment for a febrile disease from health care facilities. Chi-square analysis revealed a strong association between the edu- cational status of respondents and the meas-ures they take to prevent malaria ( 2 = 58.7; df = 16; p < 0.001). The findings clearly suggest that the majority of the respondents had adequate knowledge and enviable health seeking behav- iour. However, still a sizable faction had mis- conception and undesirable health seeking be-haviour. It's a major barrier to implement effec- tive malaria control strategies in the resource- limited settings particularly in country like Ethiopia. In this context, appropriate communi- cation strategies apparently inevitable. Therefore, appropriate communication strategies should be designed to promote the knowledge and health seeking behaviour of vulnerable section of the society in this vicinity.

INTRODUCTION Malaria remains a major cause of morbidity and mortal- ity in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, de- spite decades of malaria control efforts. There are ap-proximately 300-500 million clinical cases and about one million deaths due to malaria globally, and Africa south of the Sahara accounts for over 90% of the disease burden [1]. Most of the infections and deaths in highly endemic areas occur in children and pregnant women, who have little access to health systems [2-4]. 109 countries were endemic for malaria in 2008, 45 within the WHO African region. Ethiopia had approxi- mately 6% of malaria cases in the African Region in 2006. Malaria is present ever ywhere except in the cen- tral highlands. A total of 1.2 million cases were reported in 2007, the lowest number in the period 2001-2007 [5]. Over the past years, the disease has been consistently reported as the leading cause of outpatient visits, hospi-talization and death in health facilities across the country. The diverse eco-climatic condition in the country makes the malaria transmission pattern seasonal and unstable usually characterized by frequent focal and cyclic wide-spread epidemics [6]. Except for southern Africa, many countries in the con- tinent do not have successful malaria control pro- grammes due to the magnitude of the problem com- pounded by lack of adequate health infrastructure, as well as financial and human resources [7]. Vector-borne disease control programs mostly rely on controlling the parasite and/or vector and have often overlooked the importance of the target population's knowledge, beliefs and behavior in the transmission and control of disease [8]. Malaria control programs must consider the broad, complex and interrelated factors that influence human behavior, especially now that malaria control is theo- retically within reach of even the poorest countries through the availability of insecticide treated bednets and highly effective antimalarial drug combinations [9]. Malaria protective measures are related to knowledge and beliefs of people; when they think malaria risk is low, it is more difficult to implement protective meas-K. Karunamoorthi et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 575-581 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 576 ures [10]. The poor and vulnerable populations are dis- proportionately affected by malaria and the severe con-sequences of malaria are borne more by the poorest [11]. Studies on knowledge, attitudes and practices are be-coming more important to design and improve malaria control activities, to establish epidemiological and be-havioral baselines and to identify indicators for moni-toring programs [12]. Poor knowledge about malaria was significant factor for death from malaria among the household members in Sudan [13]. Thus, there is an urgent call for updated in-formation on key sociocultural, socio-economic indictors and human understanding about malaria to apply appro- priate control strategies. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and health seeking behavior for malaria among the local inhabitants in an endemic area of Ethiopia: Implications for control. The present study findings could provide baseline informa- tion to design effective and sustainable malaria control strategies suited to local conditions in the near future. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Study Settings The study was conducted in Serbo town, which is lo- cated 345km south-west of the capital Addis Ababa in Oromia Regional State, south-western Ethiopia. It's lo-cated between latitudes 7\u00ba35-8\u00ba00 N, and between lon-gitudes 36\u00ba46-37\u00ba14 E, at altitudes between 1,740-2,660 m above sea level and has a mean annual temperature of 19\u00b0C. According to the 2005 census, the study area had a total population of 6,115 and 511 households. Malaria is the major health problem in the Serbo town. As the six consecutive years data (2002-2007) from Serbo Health Center showed, the number of malaria cases ranged be-tween 3,925 and 22,938, with the peak being during 2004/5. The prevalence seem s decreasing although the number of cases per year is still high [14]. The main socio-economic activities of the local communities are small business, subsistence mixed farming involving the cultivation of staple crops (maize, teff and sorghum), and cattle and small stock raising. 2.2. Study Design The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey. A structured questionnaire was designed and administered by trained field workers. The first part of the question-naire included sociodemographic characteristics, whereas the second part had questions on, adult residents' know- ledge and perceptions about malaria transmission, cause, treatment seeking patterns, preventive measures and practices. To improve the quality of the data, pre-testing of the questionnaire was carried out prior to the actual data collection. The questionnaire was tested on ten re-spondents by the enumerators, in an area different from the study area, but with a similar socio-demographic pattern. 2.3. Data Collection The questionnaire was administered to 228 randomly selected households between January and March 2009. The head of household or a responsible adult was inter-viewed. Only one person per household was interviewed. To minimize bias information and variables the ques- tionnaire prepared in English language was translated into native local language Amharic to make it easy to understand and to administer by interviewers and inter- viewees. 2.4. Ethical Considerations The study was approved by the ethical clearance com-mittee of the Jimma University, Jimma, Ethiopia. Before the commencement of the su rvey, meetings with com- munity health workers, co mmunity leaders and members of the neighborhood associations were held in which the objectives of the survey were clearly explained. Written consent was obtained from e ach study participant. Every participant was assured to withdraw the interview at any phase if they wish to do so. However, all the informants actively involved and no one declined to finish the inter-view. 2.5. Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS, version 9.0. Range and mean were analysed and appropriate ta-bles, graphs and percentage were displayed. Level of significance also determined by using 95% of confi- dence intervals and p-value. 3. RESULTS 3.1. Characteristics of Study Population The socio-demographic charac teristics of respondents are presented in Table 1 . The study participants consisted of 46.5% males and 53.5% females. Majority of the re- spondents (44.3%) were in between 20-29 years old. 33.5% of the study population had no formal education. About 34.7% of the participants monthly income was 20-30 USD (Table 1) . 3.2.

In general, 98.6% of respondents had awareness about ma- laria. Majority of respondents (80.7%) were aware about the cause ('mosquito bite') of malaria irrespective of sex, age, monthly income and occupation. During the survey, 80.7% of the respondents knew that mosquitoes are transmitting the malaria. A total of 178 (78.1%) people knew that stagnant water bodies are serving as mos-quito's breeding sites (Table 2) . About 40.4% of re- spondents had known about malaria through mass media (Figure 1) . 3.3. Knowledge and Perceptions of Respondents Regarding Malaria Prevention and Control Table 2.

DISCUSSIONS This study sheds light on a group of adults in a malaria endemic area of Ethiopia regarding the level of under standing community knowledge about malaria and health seeking behavior. It provides information for Figure 2 Treatment-seeking behaviors for febrile disease as reported by respondents. educators and policy makers that are necessary for guidance towards malaria preventive campaigns. In the present survey, majority of the study participants (98.6) demonstrated general awareness about malaria, which is relatively higher than a recent study, which was con- ducted in Swaziland showed that of 320 households sur-veyed 298 (93.1%) of the respondents had heard about malaria [15]. This discrepanc y could be because of the fact that usually the population in malaria endemic set- tings has higher awareness th an the residences of en- Table 3.

In addition this study was con-ducted in urban area too. 80.7% of the respondents knew the role of mosquitoes in malaria transmission ('mosquito bite'). The respon-dents' level of awareness about mode of malaria trans-mission was very low when compared to the findings in previous studies carried out in Ethiopia which reported awareness levels of up to 93% [16,17]. However, it's relatively higher than that reported in other studies 55% of the surveyed population in a nationwide study in Ma-lawi (Ziba et al ., 1994) [18], 67% in Turkey [19], and 17.3% in Ethiopia [20,21]. However, many people had not known the real cause of malaria. Such misconceptions have also been reported from other studies in Ethiopia and other countries [22-24]. The present study findings we re comparable with previ- ous studies in India [25] and in Ethiopia [17] although the association of malaria with mosquitoes is widespread in these communities, other causal factors of malaria such as traditional beliefs like eating maize stalks, con-tact with malaria patients, exposure to rains and cold weather, bad smell and dirty water were frequently sug-gested. The correction of su ch misconceptions about the relationship between mosquito bite and malaria through health education messages is very critical for the success of malaria prevention and control using ITNs [26]. 78.1% of respondents indicated that stagnant water bodies serving as potential mosquito breeding sites. Pre- vious studies in Ethiopia have also confirmed similar findings [17,27]. However, the level of awareness re-garding mosquito breeding site was relatively lower than earlier studies. Most of the respondents knew about ma-laria related information through mass media and friends/family members. Findings were consistent with a study in Ethiopia [17]. The most common source of in-formation about malaria was from relatives. Radio was ranked third after medical personnel as a major informa-tion source [28]. The great majority of the respondents believe that regular deployment of bednets and DDT indoor residual spray (IRS) could prevent insect's bites and malaria. The findings comparable with an earlier study in Mozam-bique demonstrated that the majority of respondents as- sociate malaria with mosquitoes and are aware of vari-ous methods to prevent illness, including IRS and bed nets [29]. Table 4 Chi-square analysis suggest an asso- ciation between the educational status of individual households and the measures they take to prevent ma-laria ( 2 =58.7; df =16; p <0.001). Results consistent with an earlier study, which was conducted in Swaziland, found that most respondents believed that malaria is preventable, and mentioned clinic, spraying and the use of bed nets as key malaria preventive measures. Despite these positive responses a substantial number of them (43.4%) did not take any personal protective measures against malaria infection [15]. Indeed, several studies across the globe particularly in Africa evidently suggest that Bednets/Insecticide-treated nets are regarded as one of the most effective prevention methods and sleeping under the protection of bednets could substantially re-duce the malaria burden. Another interesting finding was that the majority of the respondents preferred to s eek treatment in the health facilities rather than approa ching traditional healers and self medication. This may be due to the fact that the Serbo health center is locat ed within the study area as result accessibility is extremely high among the local inhabitants. In addition, it's providing services free of charge. The present study find ings are comparable with few earlier studies. In Ethiopia, 98% respondents had their first visit to health care facilities including public and private health services as well as malaria control laboratories, drug venders/pharmacy and CHWs seeking treatment for malaria [17]. Another study in Swaziland found that almost 90% of th e respondents seek treatment in the health facilities [15]. The scope of malaria control is changing worldwide. With less emphasis being placed on insecticide use, in-K. Karunamoorthi et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 575-581 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 580 creased community participation in malaria control and prevention measures will be of higher importance. With greater emphasis being placed on community control and prevention, health education based on understanding community and individual behaviors, attitudes and knowledge pertaining to malaria is moving to the fore-front as a measure necessary for malaria control [30]. The present study findings clearly suggest that the majority of the study participants had adequate knowl-edge and ample enviable health seeking behavior. How-ever, still a sizable proportion had misconception and undesirable health seeking behavior. Indeed, it's a major barrier to implement effective as well sustainable ma-laria control strategies in the resource-limited and ethni-cally-diverse settings particularly in country like Ethio-pia. Therefore, appropriate communication strategies should be designed and implemented in the study area to bring the constructive outcome in the near future. 5.

ABSTRACT Accessibility and availability of fresh clean wa- ter is a key to sustainable development and es-sential element in health, food production and poverty reduction. In the present study, we have collected water sachet containing CM/L number and they were analysed for physical and bacte-riological nature. The organisms isolated in effects of these isolates were evidenced by antibiotic re-sistance, heavy metal tolerance and antibacte-rial activity. They were resistant to the antibiot-ics like amoxiclav, methicillin, chloramphenicol and streptomycin. They showed tolerance to the heavy metals at 5 mM conc. except for lead. For antibacterial activity, they were tested But at the same time these organisms could be exploited for the in-dustrial production of Useful Bacteria 1. INTRODUCTION Bottled water is defined as water that is intended for human consumption and this is sealed in bottles or other container with no added ingredients except that it may contain safe and suitable fluorides. Its price is within the reach of tautology. Small scal e entrepreneurs introduced small nylon sachets which are electrically heated and sealed at both ends to the market and is popularly called pure water. It finds patronage from members of low socio-economic class. Besides, majority of the water sachets do not carry the National Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFD AC) approval number. This m eans that they are either not registered or the procedures have not completed the registration of their products with NAFDAC. It was therefore considered implication of sachet water. Acces-sibility and availability of fresh clean water is a key to sustainable development and e ssential element in health, food production and poverty reduction. 1.2 billion Peo-ple around the world lack ac cess to safe water and 2.5 billion are not provided with adequate sanitation (Third World water forum on water, 2003). In metropolis as a whole pipe born water is inadequate both in quality and quantity. Consequently water born diseases such as cholera and typhoid often have their epidemic during the dry season. Typhoid remains a great socio-economic problem in developing countries. Proliferation of intestine is associ-ated with high mortality with wound infection occurring in 50-75% of surviours [1]. Controlling wound sepsis or wound infection also aff ected mortality [2,3]. Since this health problem was largely traceable to unhygienic water supply, an alternative to the seemingly inadequate water supply was found in bottled water. Drinking water including bottled water, may reasona- bly to expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants includes microbial pathogens, organic pollutants like heavy metals. The presence of contami-nants does not necessarily indicated that water poses a health risk. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets standards for approximately 90 contaminants in drinking water. EPA standards, along with each contaminant's likely source and health effects, are available at www. epa.gov/safewater/mcl.html . Microbiological contamination of water has long been a concern to the public. There is a concern in increasing due to outbreak of coliform bacteria, and protozoans like Giardiasis, Cryptosporidiosis. Coliforms are not a single type of bacteria but a group of bacteria that includes Klebsiella , Proteus , E. coli, and Salmonella . Coliform organisms are not necessarily N. Banu et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 582-588 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Microbial potability of bottled and packaged drinking water hawked in Ilorin metropolis was done by selecting 81 samples containing 11 brands of drinking water packaged and hawked in cellophane bags, did not met drinking water standards. Pseudomonas was frequently recovered as a contaminant of packaged water [4]. Bot- tled mineral water consumption has significantly in- creased in Brazil. Public health determines the parasi- tological and microbiological status of some brands and found occurrence of Cryptosporidial oocysts and Guardia cyst in bottled mineral water [5]. An assessment of the health and social economic implantations of sa-chet water in Ibadam Nigeria [6] selected 78 samples from 20 brands of sachet water from hawkers/vendors. Bacteria filtra- tion of water, broad diversity of viable bacteria was iso-lated by using 0.2 filter for the removal of microor- ganisms and is commonly referred as 'sterile filtration'. 19 bacterial taxa were isolated by the acclimatization method from 0.2 micron filtered fresh water samples. Cryptosporidium parvum infection in Bergen and Nor- way was found during the large water borne Giardiasis outbreak [7]. The enforcement of the regul ation guiding water qual- ity before the National Agency for Food and Drug Ad- ministration Control (NAFDAC) to employ with the checking water qualities guideline values as recom-mended by World Health Organization (W.H.O) be-comes urgent. The water sachets are the products of middle class en- trepreneurs and some small scale business ventures. The objective of the present study was to find out the quality of sachet water. We have collected seven different brands of water sachet containing CM/L number and the samples were subjected to physical and bacteriological analysis. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Media Used LB (Luria-Bertani) Agar were used to screen the sachet water sample for bacterial contami-nation. 2.2. Collection of Samples Seven sachet water samples supplied in and around Pal- lavaram were collected. All of them contained CM/L number along with ISI-14543, Ozonized and UV treated. Some of them were Reverse Osmosis processed. 3. PHYSICAL PARAMETERS pH: pH was checked for all the water samples immedi-ately after opened. 4. BACTERIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF BACTERIA 4.1. Isolation of Bacteria Seven different sachet water samples were taken up for the present study. The samples include Freeze, VSP, VPZ, Aqua fresh, Jai, Hi-tech and Sakthi. The water samples were serially spread on EMB me- dium, Nutrient agar, King's B medium and kept for 24 hours incubation at 37 C. The isolated bacterial colonies were purified to homogeneity by quadrant streaking, store in LBA, NA and KBA slants periodically subcul-tured. 4.2. Identification of Organism The bacteria isolated were identified based on the bio-chemical tests outlined in the Bergey's Manual of deter- minative bacteriology [8]. 4.3. Antibiotic Resistance/Susceptibility Screening The sensitivity/resistance Amoxi- by inoculating a loopful of the overnight grown cultures on Nutrient Agar plates amended with 30 g/ml concentrations of the appropriate antibiotics and incu- bated at 37 C. After 24 hours of incubation, the plates were observed for growth. Nu trient agar plates without antibiotics served as contro l. The minimum concentra- tion at which no growth was taken as the MIC (Mini- mum Inhibitory Concentration). 4.4. Heavy Metal Tolerance Spectrum The tolerance of the bacteria l isolates to various heavy metals such as zinc (zinc sulphate), lead (lead acetate), copper (copper sulphate), chromium (potassium chro-mate) was studied by inoculating loopful of overnight grown cultures on Nutrient Agar plates amended with 1, 3 and 5mM concentrations of heavy metals and incu-bated at 37 C. After 24 hours of incubation, the plates were observed for growth. Nu trient agar plates without heavy metal served as cont rol.

Amylase Nutrient agar along with 1% soluble starch (substrate) was taken in a conical flask and then autoclaved. They were poured into respective petriplates (triplicates). Af-ter solidifying, isolates were streaked on them and kept for incubation at 37 C. After 24 hours of incubation, the plates were stained with Gram's Iodine (indicator) and observed for zone of inhibition. 4.8. Cellulase Nutrient agar along with 1% cellulose (substrate) was taken in a conical flask and then autoclaved. They were poured into respective petripla tes (triplicates). After so- lidifying, isolates were streaked on them and kept for incubation at 37 C. After 24 hours of incubation, the plates were stained with 0.3% of Congo red (indicator); plates were kept in orbital shaker (mild shaking) for 15 minutes. Congo red was discarded and then 1 N NaCl was added to the plate and kept in shaker for 10 minutes and observed for zone of inhibition. 4.9. Antibacterial Activity of Pure Bacterial Isolates water were selected for antibacterial activity against the four human pathogenic University of Madras. Isolated bacte-ria were grown in King's B Broth and kept for incuba-tion at 37 C in orbital shaking incubator for 48 hours. After 48 hours incubation, sa mples were transferred to sterile centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 15 minutes at 4 C. Then supernatant was collected and it is filtered using 0.45 membrane filter. Filtered super-natant was stored in refrigerator for further study. Human pathogens as mentioned above were grown in Nutrient Broth and incubated for 24 hours in orbital shaking incubator at 37 C. After 24 hours pathogens were stored in refrigerator for further study. Nutrient agar plates were prepared and pathogens were swabbed on it and well were made on the plates with the help of borer. 100 l of filtered supernatant of bacterial isolates was added into the wells and kept for incubation for 48 hours. After 48 hours, plates were ob-served for antibacterial activity. 4.10. Antibacterial Activity of Isolates with Organic Solvent The supernatant of the bacterial isolates as mentioned above was taken. To that equal amount of Ethyl Acetate (EA), an universally proved polar organic solvent that could dissolve many compounds was added and kept in orbital shaker for one hour or more preferably overnight. Then transfer the organic layer and distribute it equally in to different conical flasks and cover the flask with cheese cloth to prevent contamination and after complete drying, add EA. To the residue presenting the flask, the supernatant was used for further study. Human pathogens as mentioned above were grown in Nutrient Broth and incubated for 24 hours in orbital shaking incubator at 37 C. After 24 hours, pathogens were stored in refrigerator for further study. Nutrient agar plates were prepared and pathogens were swabbed on it and well were made on the plates with the help of borer. 100 l of filtered EA supernatant was added into the wells and keep it for incubation for 48hours. After 48 hours, the plates were observed for antibacterial activity. 5. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The objective of the present study was to find out the quality of sachet water. For this, we randomly selected seven different brands of sachet water and they were collected from in and around pallavaram, Chennai. The samples were subjected to physical and bacteriological analysis. The water samples were assessed for coliform and other bacteria using Nutrient agar, KB agar and EMB agar. The results for this study support an earlier observation that the sachet water being produced is of questionable quality [9,10]. As useful as sachet water is to the society, the result of the analysis raised doubts as to its quality. The pH of wa-ter sachets has an upper range of 9.26 ( Table 1 ), a value higher than the upper limit of pH 8.5, as recommended by W.H.O. Even though pH has no direct effect on health, its indirect action on physiological processes N. Banu et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 582-588 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Name of the sachet pH Freeze 9.20 9.26 Jai 8.38 Sakthi 8.20 cannot be over emphasized [6] got the upper pH unit of 9.7 among the 78 samples from 20 brands of sachet wa-ter tested. Bacteriological analyses results (Table 2 ) showed that all the seven different brands of sachet water produced growth after 24 hours of incubation. The organisms iso-lated in reported that pure water vending machine may not be so pure, after all, because investiga-tions found bacteria like E. coli in the machine. Isolation of bacteria from pure water samples especially Strepto-coccus facealis indicates possible contamination from human excreta. The procedure most often than not are those people who may not know and are very little about the quality of water sachets they produced. Some even imitate other good products. For the price, pure water sachets are af- fordable, to the middle class society and some of the lower class also. Thus this type of packaged water is now popularly and freely served at the common people parties and social functions. Most of the small scale producers of pure water may not be able to afford the price or space for a bore hole in their premises, hence they still depend on the already condemned public water supply and water from doubtful environmental sources, for the sources of the water they use in packaging their products, some of them under very poor environmental conditions. It should be noted that the seven brands of sachet water selected for the present study carried the CM/L number and ISI certified but even they showed bacterial contamination. In the present study, Pseudomonas was isolated from all the samples and we are suggesting that the Pseudomonas also be included as an added indicator for determining their safety standard. Like us, Olayemi (1999) was fre- quently isolated Pseudomonas from packaged waters. Table 2.

That is, their presence in the water sachet pose a danger for those who are taking. The consuming public also must be in-formed of the consequences of consuming packaged water. Even though the wate r sachets are UV-treated and ozonized, it could be also recommended that produced packaged water should endeavor to disinfect their prod-ucts with solar radiation, which is simple to construct and easy to tested for their heavy metal tolerance. For this study, we selected only four heavy metals namely, copper (copper sulphate), chromium (potassium dichromate), zinc (zinc sulphate) and lead (lead acetat e) at a concentration of 1 mM, 3 mM and 5 mM. All of the four isolates showed growth at 1 mM and 3 mM concentration. But at 5 mM concentration, the heavy metal except lead seems to be toxic to the isolates and no growth was observed. This result indicates that these organisms are resistant to heavy metals at 1 mM and 3 mM concentration. For lead, they are showing tolerance even at 5 mM concentration (Table 4 ). We screened three of the industrially important extra cellular enzymes (protease, amylase and cellulase) pro- duction by our test organisms. For protease enzyme, two different substrates were used as nitrogen source i.e., Gelatin and casein. All the test organisms showed prote-ase production by plate assay method. For amylase pro-duction, starch served as a sole carbon source and the Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae is the pro- ducer of the sole carbon source but this was not pro-duced by any of the organisms tested. The isolates of sachet water shows some harmful (antibiotic resistance, heavy metal resistance) and useful properties. Useful property includes industrial enzyme production. So we can exploit these organisms for the mass production of industrial enzymes like protease and amylase ( Table 5 ). Among four bacteria Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pro- teus mirabilis were considered as human pathogens. To know its antibacterial property, we selected luteus and against Klebsiella Pseudomonas for and Micro- coccus luteus (Ta ble 6 ). The same result was observed for ethyl acetate fractions of bacterial isolates except Proteus mirabilis showed antibacterial activity against and Klebsiella pneumoniae itself was a human pathogen, it does not showed anti-bacterial activity against the same human pathogen brought from outside. But we could not exploit this to control Micrococcus luteus and Salmonella Salmonella para- typhium . We could also exploit these two isolates against Table 3.

The Environmental officers in the local Government employment owe it a duty to educate about the health risk in taking this kind of contaminant sachet water and to create awareness to the public when drinking water standards are violated. 6. CONCLUSIONS People are increasingly concerned about the safety of their drinking water. As improvements in analytical methods allow detecting impurities at very low concen-trations in water, water supplies once consider pure are found to have contaminants. The enforcement of the regulation guiding water quality before the national agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) to comply with the drinking water qualities guidelines values as recommended by W.H.O. becomes urgent. 7.

ABSTRACT Monoxenous trypanossomatids protozoa are not believed to cause in vivo infection in verte- brate hosts throughout their life cycle. However, there are reports mentioning some cases of HIV- positive patients who have presented oppor-tunistic infections caused by these protozoa. Recently, we have demonstrated the in vitro in- fection of mouse dermal fibroblasts by these protozoa. The aim of the present work is to in-vestigate the possibility of Crithidia deanei , a infect BALB/c mice or not Dexamethasone treatment. To attend it, distinct gro- ups of adult BALB/c mice were immuno-suppressed with 50 mg/kg of Dexamethasone. This immunosuppressor was administered 24 hours before infection and daily, for 15 days after C. deanei inoculation. Control groups: C. deanei -inoculated animals but non-immuno- suppressed and non-inoculated animals but immunosuppressed were also used. Light Mi-croscopy analysis revealed an infection process characterized by the presence of the trypanos-somatid inside dermal cells in the groups stud-ied. The experimental inoculation resulted in a non-lethal infection characterized by the pres-ence of the trypanossomatid inside dermal cells in the normal BALB/c mice, but notably, in the C. deanei -inoculated immunosuppressed group. These preliminary results lead to the following conclusions: 1) C. deanei is able to infect nor- mal BALB/c mice; 2) the immunosupressed mice seemed to be more susceptible to the C. deanei infection compared to the control group. Besides C. deanei in dexamethasone-immuno- suppressed mice provides a useful model for studies of monoxenous trypanosomatids 'in vivo' infection, resembling that one presumably occurring in imunodeficient individuals with AIDS. Keywords: 1. INTRODUCTION Trypanossomatids parasitize a diverse range of hosts including animals, plants and protists [1]. Some of them, such as Trypanosoma and Leishmania, are heteroxenous and are ethiological agents of serious diseases in humans and experimental animals. Others are a monoxenous and are mostly found in insects [2]. Monoxenous trypano- somatids had never been confirmed as pathogenic in vertebrate host. However, there is one report of trypano- somatid, other than Trypanosoma and Leishmania, in some opportunistic cutaneous infections in immuno- compromised individuals [3] or those without any pre- vious history of immunodepre ssion [4]. In addition, our group was pioneer in proving the infection of mouse dermal fibroblasts by two some of these trypanosomat- ids were classified as a divergent member of the Leishmania genus [6], a visceral leishmaniasis\u2014like in- fection was described in an patient as caused by Leptomonas pulexsimulantis, a monoxenous in dog's flea [3], suggesting that monoxenous protozoa can be considered opportunistic agents in immunocompromised individuals. Therefore, D. O. Santos et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 589-594 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 590 we investigated the ability of C. deanei to infect verte- brate host. For that purpose, we have used BALB/c mice under or not Dexamethasone treatment as an experi- menttal model, based on a previous report of mouse dermal fibroblasts infection by C. deanei and H. roit- mani 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS Parasite culture . Crithidia deanei was kindly provided by Dr. M. Auxiliadora de Souza (Trypanosomatids Colll- etion of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brasil). The monoxenous were kept at 28\u00b0C with serial passages at 48 h intervals in Warrens' medium [7] con- taining 10% fetal calf serum. Experimental animal infection. Female 8-week old BALB/c mice (Nau, Instituto de Biologia /UFF) were used. Animals housed in standard conditions were treated with Dexamethasone (Azium e) [8] 24 hours be- fore infection with C . deanei . After infection with 107 2-day-old promastigotes C. by subcutaneous route (hind foot pad) \u2014day 0, dexameth-asone 50 mg/kg was administered daily, for 15 days. Four BALB/c mice group were used: control without dexamethasone; con-trol Table 1 ). A determined number of mice from each group were euthanasia ted at 6 h, 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, d 7 and d 15 after C. deanei inoculation. At each control point, mice were weighted and parasite burdens were determined in foot pad by histological analysis. Histological analysis. Specimens of foot pad were fixed in 10% buffered formalin. After dehydration in graded ethanol, the tissues were embedded in paraffin and, then, processed routinely as previously reported [9]. 5 m thick sections were obtained with a Leica micro- tome. After that, they were collected on glass slides for Hematoxilin-Eosin (HE) staining. The tissues samples infected or not were observed at least 400 randomly se- lected cells at 1000 \u00d7 magnification, using a Zeiss photomicroscope. 3. RESULTS Clinical finding' s. No mortality, weight loss or clinical signs were observed in mice infected with either dexam- ethasone or not. Macroscopy findings. Both heap-tomegaly. Histological analysis. Through light microscopy the morphological analysis just of the foot pad was done. At necropsy, parasites were found in the foot pad from the mice inoculated with C. deanei , regardless immunosup- ressed or not. In the Dexamethasone treated-controls groups (in the absence of C. deanei inoculation), no hist- ological and inflammatory reations of the pad were observed until d15 ( Figure 2(e1) ). Surprisingly, in both experimental ence not of dexamethasone, C. deanei was infective to BALB/c mice (Figure 1 and 2), but, notably, in the imm- unosupressed BALB/c mice ( Figure 2 ). it observed C. deanei -infected mouse dermal cells after 24 h infection (Figures 1(a1) and (a2)). On the 2nd post infection day, C. deanei was also observed within mice dermal cells (Figures 1(b1) and (b2)). and, between whiles, ex- tracellular parasites were seen ( Figure 1(b1) ). A large numbers of parasites were clearly present in the dermal cells after the third post-infection day ( Figures 1(c1) and (c2)). Although it was possible to observe C. deanei within the dermal cells, thei r mechanism of entrance is still not clear as it can involve phagocytosis, penetration in the cell or inducing membrane invagination. Anyway, one mechanism of the C. deanei-infection might be through sincicious formation from the host cells as the image of the Figures 1(c1) and (c2) suggest. After 7 days of infection it still can observe parasites present in dermal cells C. deanei -infected mice ( Figures 1(d1) and (d2)). At this time, some extracellular parasites were still seen ( Figures 1(d1) and (d2)). After 15 days of infection, the light microscopy still revealed intracellular forms of C. deanei as well as some extracellular forms of this parasite attached to the dermal cells surface ( Figures 1(e1) and (e2)). In the controls groups (in the absence of C. deanei in- oculat ion and presence of dexamethasone) no histology- cal and inflammatory reactions of the foot pat were obs- erved until day 15 ( Figure 2(e1) ). Interestingly, the kinetics of infection in foot pad from C. deanei -inoculated Dexamethasone immunosuppressed mice showed parasites as early as in the subcutaneous tissues ( Figures 2(a1) the most exu- berant C. deanei -infection was observed in the presence of Dexamethasone on the first day of infection ( Figures 2(b1) and (b2). In the meanwhile, it can clearly observe a C. deanei within a vacuole ( Figure 2(b2) ). On the foll- owing day, it can still observe a large numbers of C. deanei inside the cells ( Figures 2(c1) and (c2)). In this time of infection, similar to the findings on the previous day, it can see that each parasite occupies its own vacu- ole (Figures 2(c1) and (c2)). The image of C. deanei inside D. O.

Here some tissue degra- dation was also observed ( Figures 2(d1) and (d2)). Int- erestingly, at the last days of infection time (7 and 15 days) in immunosupressed BALB/c mice, no parasites were found contrasting to some tissue alterations which were observed (data not shown). 4. DISCUSSION Several clinical cases suggesting that monoxenous try- panosomatids could be implicated in human infections have been described in the last years. They have been emerging as possible opportunistic pathogens in imuno- compromised individuals. An unusual Leishmania-like parasite was found in a HIV-positive patient with symp- toms of Leishmania infection [10]. Despite the previ-ous-mentioned data, genotypic and phenotypic charac-terization showed that a flagellate parasite, found in the bone marrow of a Brazilian HIV-positive patient pre-senting a visceral leishamnia sis-like reaction, was indeed a monoxenous although no tissue inva-sion could be detected [3]. Surprinsingly, a new case of cutaneous infection by a presumed monoxenous try-panosomatid was reported in the island of Martinique; however, the individual had no history of immunosup-pression, particularly HIV infection [4]. As stated earlier, Santos et al . (2004) first reported that endosymbiont-bearing trypanosomatid C. deanei and Herpetomonas roitmani fasciculate and Herpetomonas samuelpessoai (trypanossomatid c1 a2 b2 c2 d1 d2 e1 e2D. O. Santos et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 589-594 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 593593 endosimbiont free) did not infect. It is also of interest to observe that both C. deanei and H. roitmani can be res- istant to lysis mediated by the complement system. In contrast, H. samuelpessoai and C. fasciculate displayed 100% of lysis after incubation with the complement sys- tem [5]. The symbionts of C. deanei can influence the phagocytosis of these parasites by macrophages as have been presented by [11]. And, most recently, [12], re-ported the infection monoxenous trypanosomatid). Our present data further emphasize the large capacity of C. deanei to infect vertebrate host and reinforce the idea that monoxenous trypanosomatids present low host specifity [2,13,14]. As demonstrated by our work, C. deanei can readily infect normal BALB/c mice by sub- cutaneous route and infection persist in the dermal cells for 15 days. These are very interestingly results, since we have previously reported the \"in vitro\" C. deanei- infection of dermal cells obtained from a different spe- cie of mouse-the Swiss mouse [5]. Besides, as observed in our present work, extracellular forms of C. deanei are displayed in dermal tissue of the BALB/c mice ( Figures 1(b1), (d1) and (d2)). This fact is interesting to be men- tioned since it might suggest that, after intracellular C. deanei cycle, these parasites leave the host cell and, after that, appear in the extracellu lar medium (in a flagellate form) to re-infect others de rmal cells. Taken together, these evidences reinforce th e idea that monoxenous try- panosomatids are able to infect and to survive once reaching the vertebrate host. Over and again, we demon- strated the infection of BALB/c mice, but, a much more pronounced C. deanei -infection in a different experi- mental design: in Dexamethasone-immunodepressed Figure 2 ). Through its limphopenic activity, spe- cially about T cell production [15], the dexamethasone can reduce the mechanisms of anti-parasite effect of immune system and it might explain the increase of sus- ceptibily to C. deanei infection observed in all immuno- suppressed animals. The important survival of the para- site in the murine experimental host contrast strikingly with the weak clinical-pathological effects observed with absence of lymphocytic infiltrates in parasitized foot pad. This can be paralleled to that observed during human visceral leishmaniasis where patent infections with para-site dissemination are frequen tly associated with T cell unresponsiveness to Leishmania antigen [16], while cure is accompanied with restoration of the cellular response [17,18]. Although monoxenous trypanosomatids in hu- mans are more correlated to opportunistic parasites, our work is pioneer in demonstrating that C. deanei is able to infect normal mice (wh ithout dexamethasone treat- ment). Our findings corroborate to the reports of [4], who also found monoxenous tripanosomatids in a non- immunocompromised individual though in a localized skin lesion. Besides, our previous report demonstrated the monoxenous trypanosomatid infection by dermal cells isolated from skin of normal Swiss mice [5]. Nev- erthless, our data shows that the infection of C. deanei by dexamethasone-treated mice, although earlier proemi- nent at the beginning of the time of infection (Figures 2(a),(b) ), could not be followed lo nger, since the dermal cells seemed to be degenerated (data not shown). These results suggest that C. deanei might induce dermal cells degeneration. Most recently, [19] reported that C. deanei was able to induce fibroblasts lysis. Besides the interaction of monoxenous trypanossom- atids with vertebrate cells, the literature have also men- tioned some results obtained from the interaction of these trypanossomatids with invertebrate cells. Then, [20,21], reported the colonization C. deanei respectively. colonization of hematophagous in- sects by monoxenous trypanosomatids and their low host specificity, human cases of infection with lower tryp- anosomatids could have been largely underestimated until now due to their morphological similarity with Leishmania species. This emphasizes the relevance of enzymatic characterization, whenever possible, of all Leishmania- like parasites isolated from skin or visceral lesions of patients with or not immunosuppression his- tory. Taken together, these reports reinforce the idea of the urgent need of elucidating the epidemiology of these lower trypanosomatids that so far remains poorly known. 5.

ABSTRACT Brassinosteroids (BRs) are a large group of polyhydroxy steroids, which regulate numerous aspects of plant growth and development, in- cluding stem elongation, leaf bending, tracheary element differentiation, stress protection and photomorphogenesis. Recent studies indicate antigenotoxic and anticancerous activities of these compounds. The role of natural BRs in H 2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) -induced DNA damage in human lymphocytes is still unknown. The present study reports the presence of Cas- tasterone from leaves of Centella asiatica , an important medicinal herb commonly used as a memory enhancer and immunomodulator. CA50 fraction isolated from Centella asiatica was characterized as Castasterone by electrospray ionization mass spectral data with standard Castasterone. An attempt has been made to study antigenotoxic activity of the isolated Castasterone against H 2O2 -induced DNA dam- age in human blood lymphocytes using Single cell gel electrophoresis assay (Comet Assay). Castasterone at 10 -9 M concentration proved to be effective in diminishing the DNA damage by 89.42 %. Keywords: Brassinosteroids; Castasterone; Comet Assay; Hydrogen Peroxide 1. INTRODUCTION In living system, oxidative stress results in the produc- tion of reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide radical (O 2-), hydroxyl radical (HO-) and hydrogen per- oxide (H 2O2). H 2O2 in Fenton reaction is spontaneously converted to the highly r eactive hydroxyl radicals (HO-). These hydroxyl radicals oxidize proteins, lipids and nu- cleic acids leading to even mutations at the cellular level [1]. Several plant hormones are implicated in modulating the response to oxidative stress like ethylene [2], ab- scisic acid [3], auxins and plant steroids [4]. Brassinos- teroids are a group of naturally occurring plant hormones, which are structurally similar to animal steroid hor- mones. They influence diverse physiological processes by regulating the expression of genes like their animal counterparts [5]. Recent studies indicate antiviral active- ties of BRs against various viruses, like herpes simplex virus type I (HSVI), arena virus, measles virus and ve- sicular stomatitis virus [6-8 ]. The treatment of BRs to these viruses was 10-18 fold s more effective than ri- bavirin towards HSV-I and arenavirus. It has further been reported that 24-epibr assinolide can increase the mitochondrial membrane poten tial, reduce intercellular antibody levels, increase the proportion of cells in G 0/G1 phase, reduce the population of cells in s-phase and in- crease the population of viable hybridoma mouse cells at subnanomolar concentrations [9]. Anticancerous active- ties of 28-homocastasterone and 24-epibrassinolide were studied in several normal and cancer cell lines. The anticancer and antiproliferative activities have been documented very recently [10]. The BRs used showed high cytotoxic activity in breast (MCF-7/MDA-MB-468) and prostate cancer cell lines (LNCaP/DU-145) [11]. Centella asiatica (L.) (Family Apiaceae) commonly known as urban herb regarded as rasayana or rejuvenat- ing herb reputed to increase intelligence and memory in Ayurvedic medicines. The methanol extracts of whole plants of Centella asiatica showed a significant increase in the phagocytic index and total WBC count thereby showing immunomodulatory activity. [12] isolated a N.

The antioxidative properties of Centella asiatica were evaluated by [13,14]. The asi- atica extract has a chemopreventive effect [15]. [16] studied the healing effects of C. asiatica when orally administered to rats with acetic acid induced gastric ulcers, It reduced the size of ulcers in dose-dependent manner. Chemical studies reveal that triterpene saponins Asiaticoside and Madecassoside are the main active Centella asiatica . The other saponins and triterpene acids plant are brahmoside, brahmic acid, isobrahmic acid, betulic acid, centelloside and cetillic etc. The presence and role of brassinosteroids in this plant is yet to be studied. The present study was therefore planned to study the pres- ence of BRs and inhibition of H age by Castasterone isolated from Centella asiatica which is the first report in this direction. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Extraction and Purification of Brassinosteroids Study material for the present investigation included leaves of Centella asiatica procured from Dehradun (M/s (2 kg) were homogenized and percolated with 80% methanol (3 \u00d7 1000 ml). The combined metha- nol extract was dried under vacuum using rotary evapo- rator (Strike 202, Stereoglass, Italy). 80% methanol ex- tract (449.6 g) was partitioned between chloroform and water. Chloroform extract was then partitioned between 80% methanol and hexane. The resulting 80% methanol extract (28.3 g) was par titioned between ethyl acetate and distilled water. The ethyl acetate fraction (20 g) was dried and subjected to silica gel (60-120 mesh) column chromatography with step-gradient elution from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 15, 20, 50, 100% (each 500-1000 ml). All the fractions were subjected to radish hypocotyl bio- assay with the aim to find fraction. Four fractions CA5, CA10, CA50 and CA60 were found to be active ( Figure 1 ). CA50 fraction was directly subjected The bioactivity of isolated fractions was determined us- ing intact plants of Raphanus sativus as described by [17]. 5 days-old seedlings were placed into the test solu- tions (0.03 ml of fraction diluted with distilled water to get the final volume 3 ml). 3 ml solution was poured in each petriplate containing radish seedlings and kept in 050100150200250 0 1 2 5 6 7 10 15 20 50 60 70 100percent in cre ase Figure 1.

Percent increase over control was calculated. 2.3. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry of CA 50 Fraction ESI-MS analysis of CA50 and standard Castasterone was carried out by the addition of 10 l of concentrated aqueous formic acid solution to the sample mixture to a total volume of 1000 l making 0.1% as final concentra- tion. ESI-QTOF-MS was performed tion mode in QTOF Mass Spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). The general conditions were: Source temperature of 280 C, capillary voltage of 2.1 kV and cone voltage of 23 V . ESI-MS was performed by direct infusion with a flow rate of 10 l/min using a syringe pump and mass spectra were acquired and accumulated over 60 s. MassLynx 4.0 (Waters, Manchester, UK) was used for data analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry of single molecular ion in the mass spectra was performed by mass-selecting the ion of interest, which was in turn submitted to 15-35 eV collisions with argon in the colli- sion quadrupole. 2.4. Comet Assay DNA damage was determined alkaline single cell microgel electrophoresis (com et assay) assay following the method proposed by [18] with minor modifications as suggested by [19]. Heparinized blood samples were obtained by venipuncture from a non-smoking, healthy male donor aged 30-40 years. Lymphocytes were iso- lated by the method of [20] and mixed with equal vol- ume of Phosphate Buffer Saline (PBS) pH 7.2. This mixture was then overlayed to double volume of Histo- paque 1077 and centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 20 minutes. The layer containing lymphocytes was aspirated very carefully with the help of pasture pipette. The lympho- cytes were diluted in PBS and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was discarded and pellet was again suspended in PBS and centrifuged at 2000 rpm N. Sondhi et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 595-602 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

To evaluate the extent of DNA damage, 100 randomly se- lected cells were analysed from each sample by Nikon Epifluorescent Microscope (Nikon Eclipse E200) con- nected to a digital camera. Imaging was performed by using a computerized image analysis system (Lucia Comet Assay Software 4.8 of Laboratory Imaging Ltd.) which acquires images, computes the integrated intensity profile for each cell, estimates the comet cell compo- nents (head and tail) and evaluates a range of derived parameters. These include % Head DNA, % Tail DNA and tail moment (an index of DNA damage that consid- ers both the tail length and fraction of DNA in comet tail). The Antigenotoxic activity of CA50 was expressed by percent decrease of Tail moment: Inhibition (%) = a - b/a - c \u00d7 100 a = Tail moment induced by H 2O2 (positive control). b = Tail moment of the fraction in the presence of H2O2. c = Tail moment of the negative control. 3. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The results were obtained as the mean and standard error of three experiments. The data in all the experiments were analyzed for statistical significance using analysis of variance (one-way ANOV A). The difference among average values was compared by high-range statistical domain (HSD) using Tukey's Test [21]. 3.1. Results and Discussion CA50 fractions was isolated and characterized as cas- tasterone by ESI-QTOF-MS/ MS analysis. Electrospray Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) showed the pseudomolecular mass ion peaks at m/z 465 [M + H]+ and 487 [M + Na]+ corresponded to the molecular weight 464 [M]+ and molecular formula as C 28H48O5. ESI-QTOF-MS/MS analysis of m/z 465/487 revealed The at m/z 447/469,429/451 were observed due to the sequential loss of two H 2O molecules.

We report for the first time, the presence of Castasterone in C entella asiatica major mass fragmenta- tions. presence of brassinosteroids in medicinal plant like Centella asiatica suggests a possible medicinal applica- tion of these compounds. Brassinosteroids are found in gymnosperms, monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, and in algae. Studies [22-24] confirmed that BRs are obligatory plant constituents, the highest concentra- tion being found in the reproductive organisms and in growing tissues (pollen, immature seeds and shoots). H 2O2-induced DNA damage was studied using various parameters. These parameters were measured using Lu- cia Comet Assay Software. Percent inhibition was cal- culated on the basis of comet evaluation i.e. Tail moment. The observations made on various parameters of DNA indicated that 10 -9, 10-10 and 10-11 M concentrations of Castasterone were not toxic as no significant change was noticed when compared with negative control i.e. dis- tilled water. Percent head DNA in the treatments of Castasterone revealed no significant change when compared with negative control i.e. only distilled water. The H 2O2 treatment however reduced %Head DNA. But supple- mentation of Castasterone with H 2O2 to lymphocytes revealed an observable enhancement in % Head DNA. It increases from positive control (83.08%) to (93.66%) at 10 -9 M concentration ( Table 1 ). Similar observations were made for % Tail DNA and Tail moment. BRs treatments showed amelioration of toxicity. % Tail DNA decreased significantly with the increase in concentra- tion of castasterone. A sign ificant decrease in Tail mo- ment was observed with the increase in the concentration of castasterone ( Figure 5 ). It varied from 1.35 (10 -11M), 1.02 (10-10 M), 0.48 (10-9 M). Percent inhibition was maximum in 10-9 M concentration i.e. 89.42% ( Table 1 ). The reports obtained on the toxicity of BRs suggested that they do not have negative influences in mammals, N.

Mutagenic studies carried out at the Scien- tific Research Center of Toxicological and Hygienic Regulation of Biopreparations of Russia showed that Ames test, with or without metabolic activitation, was negative with the A.marmelos had also been studied by [26]. Reactive oxygen species can damage the normal cel- lular functions and can cause atherosclerosis in vessels or malignant growth in other tissues and ageing proc- esses [27]. The lymphocytes when treated with H 2O2 showed the significant DNA damage. However this damage was ameliorated significantly by the simultane- ous application of different concentrations of this BR. The H 2O2 stress protective properties of BRs in human lymphocytes are the first such study carried out with plant steroids. In the presen t study, the protective effect observed against the ROS may in part be responsible to the anticancer activity of brassinosteroids reported by some workers [11,28]. In the studies carried out by [29] three types of 5 -androstane and ergostane analogues of brassinolide, containing a fluorine atom in either the 3 or the 5 positions or in 3 or the 5 positions, were prepared using standard operations. The 5 fluorine was found to effect chemical reactivity as well as physical properties of the products. Cytotoxicity of the products was studied using human normal and cancer cell lines with 28-homocastasterone as positive control and their brassinolide type activity was established using the bean second-internode test with 24-epibrassinolide as stan- dard. The equivalence of F and OH groups was observed in some of the active compounds. Ergostane derivatives were most active in the anticancer activity while andro- stane derivatives were active in brassinolide type activity. Brassinolide was found to induce a time and concentra- tion dependent cytotoxicity in androgen-independent human prostate cancer in PC-3 cells. The mode of cell death appeared to be predominately apoptosis. Western blot studies indicated that treatment with brassinolide triggered a time dependent decrease in the expression of N. Sondhi et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 595-602 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. and found to inhibit the growth, at micro- molar concentrations, of several human cancer cell lines without affecting the growth of normal cells [10]. Stud- ies carried out by Malikova et al . (2008) indicate that BRs may prove to be promising leads for the develop- ment of new generation of anticancer drugs. Varoius animal steroids have been found to exhibit antioxidant properties [30]. BRs have also been reported to regulate antioxidative defence system of plants under stress con- ditions [31]. The reduction in DNA damage indicates amelioration of oxidative stress generation by H 2O2 in lymphocytes. The tissues are protected from oxidative damage by variety of mechanism including antioxidants and antioxidative enzymes, repair enzymes and growth regulators. Further studies ar e needed to understand the mechanism of protective effect of these steroids in ani- mal system which opens a field of study on possible medical applications of these plant steroids. 4.

ABSTRACT This study aimed to characterize energy expen- diture patterns using the tri-axial accelerometer and to identify the association of energy exp- enditure with clinical parameters in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Estimates of energy expenditures represented by total ac- tivity calorie (TA), physical activity calorie (PA), total activity calorie per body weight (TABW), and physical activity calorie per body weight (PABW) of 49 female SLE patients were ass- essed using the RT3 tri-axial accelerometer (StayHealthy, Monrovia, CA) in a seven-day per- iod. SLE patients in the highest body mass ind- ex (BMI) tertile showed significantly lower valu- es of TABW compared to those in the lowest tertile, while SLE patients in the lowest TABW tertile showed significantly higher body weight, waist circumference, BMI, SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), dosage of prednisone, and blood pressure. There was a high prevalence of metabolic syndrome and SLE patients with metabolic syndrome showed significantly lower TABW. In addition, both TABW and PABW sig- nificantly correlated with SLEDAI. In conclusion, the RT3 accelerometer is suitable for evaluating total and physical activity-related energy expenditure in patients with SLE. TABW measured by the tri-axial accelerometer is inv- ersely related with body weight status and dise- ase activity in SLE patients. This suggests that estimates of energy expenditure by the tri-axial accelerometer may be applied in the manage- ment of SLE. Keywords: Accelerometer; Body mass index; Systemic Lupus Erythematosus INTRODUCTION Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic auto- immune disease characterized not only by the activation of T and polyclonal B cells but also by a wide variety of immunologic abnormalities [1]. Previous studies demo- nstrate that SLE patients present with limitations in ex- ercise capacity and reduced quality of life due to various clinical complaints [2]. The exercise intolerance of SLE patients is associated with a reduced aerobic capacity of peripheral muscles [3], such that SLE patients are less aerobically fit, with reduced exercise capacity, reduced muscle strength, more fatigue, and greater disability compared to sedentary controls [4]. The incidence of SLE is higher in females than in males. There is strong evidence on the relationship bet- ween physical activity and the primary prevention of chronic health problems in women [5]. Estimates of en- ergy expenditure provided a better indicator of physical activity. However, methods to assess energy expenditure have strengths and limitations [6]. The RT3 accelerometer, an in in medio-lateral, ante- rior-posterior, and vertical dimensions, is a valid tool for assessing physical activity [7-9]. Although its reliability, validation, and application in measuring physical active- ity in different population have been reported [10-15], the relationship between disease activity and energy ex- penditure measured by the RT3 accelerometer in SLE patients has not been previously established. This study aimed to characterize energy expenditure patterns using the RT3 accelerometer and identify any relationship between energy expenditure and clinical parameters in SLE patients. T. K. Tso et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 603-608 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 604 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-nine (49) Chinese female SLE patients aged 20-50 years who fulfilled the American College of Rheuma- tology criteria [16] and had no contraindications to physical activity were randoml y selected from the outpa- tient clinics of Taichung Veterans General Hospital (Taichung, Taiwan). The hospital's ethical committee approved the study and all SLE patients provided written informed consent. Energy expenditure was assessed using the RT3 Tri- axial Activity Measurement and Recording System (Stay- Healthy, Monrovia, CA, USA). The RT3 was a relatively small device (the size of a pager) and used an integrated tri-axial accelerometer. These were worn by the SLE patients in nylon pouches secured to a belt at the waist- line above each hip during the seven-day period. The patients' profiles, including age, height, and weight, were entered into the RT3 accelerometer and the accel- eration was measured periodically. Information obtained was then converted into energy expenditure estimates that included total activity calorie (TA), physical activity calorie (PA), total activity calorie per body weight (TABW), and physical activity calorie per body weight (PABW). Anti-dsDNA was measured by enzyme-linked immu- Quanta Lite TM dsDNA Kit (INOV A Diagnostics Inc., San Diego, USA). Quan- titative determinations of serum C3 and C4 were using N Antisera to Human Complement Factor reagents with the Behring Ne phelometers (Dade Behring, Inc., Newark, DE, USA). Disease activity was deter- mined using the SLE Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) [17], while enzymatic methods were used to determine circulating concentrations of total cholesterol (Beckman TC Reagent) and triglycerid e (TG) (Beckman TG Re- was used to syndrome was based on the National Cho- lesterol Education Program (NCEP/ATP III) definition [19]. SLE patients were defined as having metabolic syndrome in the presence of three or more of the fol- lowing criteria: waist circumference > 88 cm; systolic blood pressure > 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure > 85 mmHg; HDL-C < 50 mg/dL; TG > 150 mg/dL; and fasting blood glucose > 110 mg/dL. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statisti- cal Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) 10.0 for Win- dows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Tested variables for comparison of means were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and 95% confidence interval. The distribution of tested variables was examined graphically for normality. Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to examine the mean differences of en- ergy expenditure between the SLE patients stratified by BMI and metabolic syndrome. Analysis of variance (ANOV A) was also used to examine the mean differen- ces of test parameters among SLE patients stratified by tertiles of TABW as measured by the RT3 accelerometer. In addition, Pearson's or Spearman correlation analysis was used accordingly to examine the relationships be- tween estimates of energy expenditure and test variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant for all sta- tistical analyses in this study. 3. RESULTS All of the patients were non-smokers, performed regular daily activities, and did not attend any supervised exer- cise training program during the experiment period. Av- erage estimates of energy expenditures measured by the RT3 accelerometer were 1730 \u00b1 218 Kcal/day a normal kg/m 2), nine (18%) were overweight (25-29.9 kg/m2), and four (8%) were obese (> 30 kg/m2). Compared to patients with normal BMI, overweight or obese patients had higher SLEDAI (mean: 3.38 \u00b1 2.50, n = 13 vs. 1.28 \u00b1 1.80, n = 36, p TABW (mean: 2.60 Kcal/kg/day, n = 36, p < 0.001). The me- dian SLEDAI value in all patients was 2 and only 31% of patients had SLEDAI scores higher than 3, indicating that most of the patients had stable or moderately active disease status [20]. However, SLEDAI significantly cor- related with body weight (r = 0.434, p = 0.002) and BMI (r = 0.379, p = 0.007). Both TABW (r = -0.303, p = 0.034) and PABW (r = -0.301, p = 0.035) negatively correlated with SLEDAI. Estimates of energy expenditure measured by the RT3 accelerometer in SLE patients stratified by BMI were shown in Table 1 . SLE patients in the highest BMI ter- tile showed significantly higher TA and PA, and signify- cantly lower TABW compared to those in the lowest tertile. In addition, there was a significant negative cor-relation between BMI and TABW (r = -0.668, p < 0.001). Estimates of energy expenditure in SLE patients with and without metabolic syndrome were shown in Table 2 . According to the NCEP/ATP III definition, 21 patients (43%) met the criteria for metabolic syndrome. They had significantly higher TA and PA, and significantly lower TABW. T. K.

SLE patients in the lowest TABW tertile showed higher body weight, waist circ- umference, BMI, SLEDAI, dosage of prednisone, and blood pressure. Patients in the higher TABW tertile tended to have reduced concentrations of total cholest- erol, TG and LDL-C but the differences were not statis- tically significant. 4. DISCUSSION This study evaluated estimates of energy expenditure by using the RT3 accelerometer in 49 female SLE patients. The major finding was that estimates of energy expen- diture represented as daily TABW and PABW were negatively associated with disease activity. There is a number of assessm ents available for evalu- ating physical pedometers, accelerome- ters, and supervised cardio-vascular training programs [11,21,22]. However, each method has its own strengths and limitations. The RT3 accelerometer is used to assess physical activity in children [10,11], adolescents [11], overweight adults [12], pregnant women [13], individu- als with multiple sclerosis [14], and older adults with coronary heart disease [15]. Kl assen et al. report that the RT3 accelerometer can detect a significant difference between moderately active and active individuals with multiple sclerosis [14]. Chu et al. have demonstrated that RT3 movement counts increases in a linear manner with scaled oxygen uptake from stationary to vigorous inten- sity movement in children [10]. In the present study, the RT3 accelerometer is used to assess estimates of energy expenditure in SLE patients and is proven to be user- friendly and an acceptable measure of free-living physic- cal activity in such popula tion. The RT3 accelerometer appears to distinguish estimates of energy expenditure in SLE patients with varying clinical characteristics. Recent studies demonstrate the beneficial effects of exercise in SLE patients in terms of improving fatigue, physical function, aerobic fitness, and quality of life [22-25]. Aerobic exercises performed on a treadmill do not aggravate disease activity at any time during an ex- ercise period and may provide some benefits on fatigue T. K.

In a 12-week supervised cardio-vascular training program, SLE patients have shown improved exercise tolerance, aerobic capacity, oxygen pulse, fat- igue, quality of life, depression, and functional capacity [22]. In a pilot study on the effect of exercise in SLE patients, both aerobic and range of motion/muscle strengthening types of exercises are safe and do not worsen SLE disease activity [23]. In the present study, SLE patients with lowest TABW tertile show higher SLEDAI and dosage of prednisone. It also identifies both TABW and PABW to be inversely correlated with SLEDAI, suggesting that improved daily energy expen- diture may be beneficial to disease management in SLE. Obesity is independently associated with impaired functional capacity and health-related quality of life in patients with SLE [26] and disease activity is predictive of deleterious increases in BMI [27]. Although only 26% of patients in this study are overweight or obese with BMI > 25 kg/m 2, they have higher SLEDAI and lower TABW. SLE patients in the lowest TABW tertile show the highest body weight, waist circumference, BMI, SLEDAI, dosage of prednisone, and blood pressure, as well as a positive correlation between BMI and SLEDAI (r = 0.379, p = 0.007). Taken together, the findings here suggest that less energy expenditure corresponding to increased BMI may aggravate, at least partly, the disease activity in female SLE patients. However, due to lack of self-reported information about the time record and types of activity when the RT3 accelerometer was on and off, physical activity intensity and metabolic equiv- alent energy expenditure cannot be completely evaluated. Recent studies demonstrate a higher prevalence of in- sulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in SLE patients [28,29]. The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome is confirmed in the present study wherein 21 of 49 (43%) SLE patients have metabolic syndrome using the NCEP/ ATP III definition. Physical activity energy expenditure can predict progression towards metabolic syndrome in middle-aged healthy Caucasians [30]. SLE patients with metabolic syndrome in the present study show signify- cantly lower TABW. In addition, patients with higher T. K. Tso et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 603-608 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 607607 TABW to reduced concentrations of total cho- lesterol, TG, and LDL-cholesterol. However, the lipid profiles of most patients in this study are within normal range and not considered dyslipidemic [19], which can limit possible effect of physical activity-related energy expenditure on circulating lipid levels. In conclusion, as increasing physical activity can be a component of lifestyle interventions designed to improve quality of life and functional capacity in SLE patients, this study demonstrates the relationship among estimates of energy expenditure measured by RT3 accelerometer, disease activity, and components of metabolic syndrome. Incorporating physical activity-related energy expendi- ture into the clinical management of SLE may be bene- ficial. 5.

ABSTRACT Fresh osteochondral grafts find broad applica- tion in the treatment of extensive and focal damages of joint surfaces. The maintenance of chondrocyte viability of the collected grafts is of key importance. Aim: The evaluation of chon-drocyte survivability in a stable temperature of 4 0C in different preservative solutions is the aim of this work. Method: Chondrocyte survivability has been evaluated in saline solution (group I), Ringer solution (group II), saline with an addi-tion of hyaluronic acid (group III) and saline en-riched with glucosamine sulphate (group IV). The amount of live chondrocytes was examined on the day of collection and subsequently after 1, 2, 3,6,12, and 21 days using the Promega MTT test. Results: The highest number of live chon-drocytes as calculated for 1g of hyaline carti-lage after 21 days was ascertained in group IV (saline with glucosamine sulphate). The lowest number of live chondral cells was observed in group II (saline with hyaluronic acid). Chon-drocyte survivability in saline (group I) was higher than in the Ringer solution (group II). Conclusions: The enrichment of saline solution with glucosamine sulphate protracts the viabil-ity of chondrocytes of fresh allogeneic osteochondral grafts to repair extensive damage to joint su rfaces spans more than 100 years [1]. Grafts of many different types and sizes have been used, from various cylindrical osteochondral grafts with radii ranging from severa l millimeters to larger than 1 cm, through shell grafts, to the transplantation of whole joint surfaces of tibial or femoral condyles [2]. The size of fresh allogeneic osteochondral grafts not- withstanding, the determination and maintenance of safe conditions for the do nor joint surfaces remains an ongo- ing issue. It is crucial to maintain strict sanitary stan-dards for grafts until their implantation. Although rules regarding such standards are determined by laws, and thus differ by country, it is important for hospitals to organize a specialized transplant service with procedural guidelines, which will mitigate difficulties encountered while performing this repair method. The tasks of such a service should include recr uiting donors and preparing potential recipients for transplantation. Efficient use of fresh allogeneic grafts of joint surfaces is essential be- cause the chondrocytes of transplanted cartilage atrophy rapidly. Tissue survival can be extended by cooling col- lected fragments. However, freezing typically destroys live chondral cells and disintegrates the intercellular matrix structure [3]. Thus, maintaining the viability of collected chondrocytes is a ke y issue to be addressed at centers that use this method of joint cartilage repair. Sig- nificant chondrocyte survival can be maintained for only 1-2 weeks by preserving osteochondral grafts in normal saline with antibiotics, buffer ed normal saline, or Ringer solution cooled to 4\u00b0C, although this period can be ex- tended [4-6]. Thus there is a continuing need for meth- ods that prolong the safe preservation and transport of graft materials with live chondrocytes. Pharmaceuticals and dietar y supplements that pur- portedly improve chondrocyte vitality and the ability of damaged chondral surfaces to self-repair have gained K. Gawda et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 609-612 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 610 popularity in recent years. Various derivatives of hyalu- ronic acid and substances containing glucosamine are most frequently used. 2. AIM The widespread use of hyaluronic acid and glucosamine compounds in the pharmacoth erapy of focal and gener- alized joint cartilage damages raises the prospect of pos-sibly extending chondrocyte vitality by adding these substances to the transport solutions for osteochondral grafts. Therefore, in this study, we determined the sur-vival of human chondral cells stored in vitro at the same temperature, but in different conserving solutions. 3. MATERIALS AND METHODS The distal femoral epiphysis was collected along with the cartilage coating from six male donors, aged 21-48 years, in the operating room after the conclusion of multi-organ collections. The obtained osteochondral spe- cimens were divided into four equal parts. Each was randomly assigned for immersion in one of the following four media: normal saline solution (group I), Ringer so-lution (group II), normal saline solution with 20 mg so-dium salt of hyaluronic acid (group III), or normal saline solution enriched with 1.5 g glucosamine sulphate (group IV). Each medium was enriched with 1.0 g third- generation cephalosporin. Each of the obtained quarters of the distal femoral epiphysis was subsequently divided into seven equal parts, which were placed in separate sterile containers filled with the evaluated solution. All samples were stored at 4\u00b0C. Live chondrocyte numbers in the initial samples of each group were quantitatively analyzed within 24 h after collection using colorimetric reduction bromide) test. Evaluations were subsequently conducted on Days 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 21. The obtained absorption capacity was proportional to the cellular oxidoreductive activity and subsequently scaled to 1 g hyaline cartilage. Measurement results were evaluated using analysis of variance (ANOV A) and Friedman's and Dunnet's statistical tests. The research was approved by the Bioethical Com- mission of the Medical Univer sity of Lublin (PL) no. KE-0254/143/2006, according to Good Clinical Practice conditions. 4. RESULTS None of the evaluated groups showed a statistically sig-nificantly change in absorption from initial values during the first 3 days of observation. Group IV (saline solution enriched with glucosamine) had the highest absorption values, both initially and during the subsequent evalua-tion days, as calculated per gram of cartilage. A statisti-cally significant decline in live chondrocyte numbers occurred between Days 3 and 6 of storage in Ringer fluid (group II) and saline with sodium salt of hyaluronic acid (group III). A similar decline occurred in normal saline (group I) between Days 12 and 21 of storage. No statis-tically significant decrease in the number of live chon- drocytes was evident in group IV (saline enriched with glucosamine sulphate) over the entire observation pe-riod. At Day 21, group IV samples had the highest number of live chondrocytes, and the difference in counts be-tween this group and each ot her group was statistically significant. The lowest numbers of liv e chondrocytes throughout the whole research period were found in group III, saline solution with sodium salt of hyaluronic acid. The most Table 1.

Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 611611 rapid drops in numbers of live chondral cells were also observed in this group. The number of live chondral cells in group II (Ringer solution) was lower than in group I (normal saline solution). 5. DISCUSSION The storage period of fresh osteochondral grafts greatly affects their clinical value, where longer storage reduces the number of live chondral cells [7].Allen et al . re- ported a significant decline in live chondral cell numbers in osteochondral grafts within 3 weeks of collection [4]. Previous research has focused on protecting chondrocyte vitality in allogeneic osteochondral grafts primarily by changing the temperature. V oss et al. demonstrated that storing cartilage at room temperature accelerated cell death [8], and a critical incr ease occurred between 50\u00b0C and 55\u00b0C. In contrast, lowering the temperature is gen- erally favorable to chondro cyte survival. Pearsall re- the number of live chondrocytes dropped to 67% of the initial value after a storage period of 44 days at 4\u00b0C [9]. Judas et al . showed that adding protective substances to the agents in which osteochondral grafts were stored before freezing extended chondrocyte sur-vival [10]. Adding tetracycline-type antibiotics may im- prove the vitality of chondral graft cells [11]. Teng et al . examined the impact of IGF-1(insulin-like growth factor 1) and the apoptosis inhibitor zV AD-fmk in Ringer fluid and Dulbecco's modified (DMEM) on the survival of bovine chondrocytes [7]. Chondrocytes atrophied most rapidly in Ringer fluid; the process was slower in DMEM. Adding either IGF-1 or zV AD-fmk to the DMEM significantly extended the survival of chondral cells. Pennock analyzed the survivability of human chondrocytes in osteochondral grafts suspended in normal saline, glucose, amino acid solution, and 10% fetal bovine serum solution [12]. Chondrocyte survival was significantly lower in solutions without bovine se- rum. However, storing tissue with bovine serum requires further research on the possibility of the transmission of infections as well as immune reactions to proteins from foreign species. The results of our research demonstrate that chondro- cyte cell death was quickest in saline solution enriched with sodium salt of hyaluronic acid. We are not in a po- sition to determine why adding hyaluronic acid deriva-tives did not improve chondrocyte graft vitality. Samples of human joint cartilage stored for 3 weeks in saline so- lution enriched with glucosamine sulphate retained their vitality to the greatest degree compared to samples pre- served in normal saline alon e, Ringer solution, and nor- mal saline solution plus sodium salt of hyaluronic acid. Thus, chondrocyte vitality can be increased by enriching the fluid environment of graft preservation with gluco-samine sulphate. The lowest decline in liv e chondrocyte numbers over a 3-week period decreased the biological value of the graft only slightly. Our results show that the inevitable process of in vitro chondral cell atrophy dur- ing the storage period for surgical transplantation of joint surfaces may be slowed to ma intain high biological and mechanical value of the graft. Otsuki et al. showed that a decrease in glycosaminoglycan concentration did not lead directly to the intensification of chondral joint cell atrophy [13]. Based on our analyses, increasing the amount may slow these processes. REFERENCES [1] Lexer, E.

ABSTRACT In this article we present the case of an epi- dermoid cyst of sublingual space along with submental extension in a 35 year old lady who presented with a mass in the oral cavity. On examination a mass was seen on the floor of the mouth displacing the tongue superiorly. Diffuse fullness was noted in the submental region. The lesion was excised under general anaesthesia with nasotracheal intubation. The entire mass was removed intra orally. The histological fea-tures were suggestive of epidermoid cyst. The patient did well postoperatively and no recur-rence was seen during 8 months follow up. Keywords: Sublingual; Epidermoid Cyst; Intraoral Approach 1. INTRODUCTION The epidermoid are those benign cysts which are lined by epithelium only, where as dermoid cysts are those which contain skin and adnexa and teratoid cysts are those which cartilage, bone and even muscle pre-sent [1]. Dermoid and epidermoid cysts are develop-mental pathologies that occur in the head and neck with an incidence of 6.9-7% [1,2]. About 11.5% of dermoid cysts of the head and neck ar e in the floor of the mouth, the second most common location after the cervical re-gion. They represent less than 0.01% of all oral cavity cysts [3]. Surgical excision is the treatment of choice. 2. CASE REPORT A 35 year old lady was presented to the department of ENT, K.S.Hegde Hospital, Mangalore, with the history of mass in the oral cavity since one and half months. The swelling was painless. She had no difficulty in moving the tongue and there was no history of dysphagea or dyspnoea. On examination of the oral cavity, an ovoid solitary mass measuring about 4 cm \u00d7 3 cm was present in the midline on the floor of the mouth. Edges could not be distinctly made out. Mucosa over the swelling was nor-mal but appears stretched. The swelling was soft to cys-tic in consistency. The lesion extends into the submental region causing diffuse fullness in the submental region. Transmission of movements between intra-oral and submental swelling was felt. Transillumination was negative. A provisional diagnosis of sublingual dermoid cyst or plunging ranula was made. Routine haematological tests were within normal limits. Excision of the mass was done under general anaes- thesia with nasotracheal intubation. A horizontal incision was placed intra orally on the floor of the mouth. The mass appeared to be a thick walled tense cyst and it was excised in toto. The submental extension through the mylohyoid muscle was excised from the same incision. Post-operative period was uneventful and she was dis- charged after 5 days. She was seen in the outpatient de-partment after 2 weeks and then after 4 months and 8 months and no recurrence is noted. 3. DISCUSSION Meyer classified cysts of the floor of the mouth into three groups namely Epidermoid, Dermoid and Teratoma [4]. Histologically midline cysts of of the mouth are divided into epidermoid cysts which consist of an epithelial lined wall that may be partly keratinized; dermoid cysts, which show evidence of skin appendages such as hair follicles, hair, sweat and sebaceous glands; and teratomas which contain, in addition to skin ap-pendages, mesodermal elements like bone, muscle, res-piratory and gastrointestinal tissues and a fibrous capsule. The later type may have malignant potential [1,4]. Congenital cysts are dysembryogenetic lesions that arise from ectodermal during mid-line fusion of first and seco nd branchial arches between the third and fourth weeks of intrauterine life. Congenital cysts may rise from the tuberculm impar during the for- S. K. Bhandary et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 613-614 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

Epidermoid cysts have thin squamous lining because of lack of dermal appendag es, which rarely contains calcifications. These cysts contain debris from the des- quamation of the epithelial lining. The debris contain mainly keratin, a proteinaceous material and some cho-lesterol. These are often described as pearly tumours because of the shiny smooth waxy character of the \"dry keratin\" on gross inspection [1]. Dermoid cysts are well circumscribed lesions most commonly seen at the lateral canthus of the eye. They are typically lined by squamous epithelium and contain skin appendages but unlike epidermoid cyst they have a thicker lining and may contain dystrophic calcification [7]. Ultrasonographically the solid and cystic structures within a heterogenous mass and calcifications are seen Treatment is by surgical excision of intra oral cysts in the floor of the mouth to relieve symptoms caused by the cyst and possible infection. Us ually intra oral incision is placed for small cysts but large ones require an external approach. Post operative comp lications are rare and are reduced by closely following the capsule and its com-plete removal [8]. 4. CONCLUSIONS We report a case of epidermoid cyst in the sublingual region with extension into submental region through the mylohyoid muscle, presenting as an intraoral and sub-mental swelling. The cyst was completely excised through intraoral incision without any complications and without any evidence of recurrence in 8 months follows up. REFERENCES [1] Koeller, K.K., et al.

ABSTRACT The biological reasons for aging are now un- derstood. Aging is the result of multiple sto-chastic events in molecules, cells, tissues and organs. These together produce the aged phe-notype, senescence and ultimately death. Many of these changes can be directly linked to spe-cific age-associated disease. However, there are also age-related changes that are not patho-logical. It can be said that aging has multiple causes, or is instead due to a general loss of molecular fidelity, that is, an increase in disor-der. The complexity of organism means that they develop as ordered structures by obtaining energy from the environment. These ordered structures must be maintained by a wide variety of mechanisms which also depend on energy resources. Eventually these mechanisms fail, and senescence sets in. It is known that the ef-ficiency of maintenance is correlated directly with the lifespan of different mammalian species. Also, these lifespans are inversely correlated with fecundity or reproductive potential. There is a trade off between investment of resources in maintenance of the body, or soma, and in-vestment in reproduction. Keywords: Aging; Senescence; Disease; Pathologies; Evolution 1. INTRODUCTION It is now evident that aging is no longer an unsolved biological problem [1-6]. However, the relationship be-tween natural aging in humans to age-associated dis-eases is controversial. Most books and reviews about aging completely ignore the vast literature on human age related pathologies. Also, most research on each of these pathologists is done by specialists who have no particu-lar knowledge or interest in the process of ageing per se. An exception that relates late onset disease to aging is the excellent monograph The Oxford Textbook of Geriat- ric Medicine [7]. Hayflick [8] has argued that aging is an intrinsic process occurring in almost all animals, and that it is not directly related to particular age-associated pa- thologies. Instead, he states that aging makes an animal susceptible to these pathological events. In contrast, it is argued here and elsewhere [2,5,9] that the process or processes of aging are responsible for most of these pathological changes. This le ads to the loss or decline of health that is eventually le thal. Many diseases are the result of multiple molecular or cellular events. These events may occur over a long period of time, and it is their multiplicities that eventually produce the symptoms of disease. In other words many diseases can be due to time dependent multiple \"hits\" which are stochastic random events. There is an intermediate position which states that \"senescence gives rise to disease, but disease does not give rise to senescence\" [10], and also that the distinction between senescen ce and disease is blurred. At the outset it is important to define some key words. Health is the state of being free from illness or injury. Aging is the process of growing old. Senescence is the condition or process of deterioration with age. Aging (ageing) and senescence are often used interchangeably. Disease is a disorder of stru cture or function which is not simply the result of specific injury. Pathology is the sci-ence of the causes and effects of diseases. (It is also the branch of medicine that deals with the laboratory ex-amination of samples of body tissue for diagnostic or forensic purposes, but this is not relevant to the discus-sion here). 2. THE BIOLOGICAL REASONS FOR AGING To understand aging one must first explain its biological origin and function. Organisms develop from the fertil-ized egg to become adults that are capable of reproduc-tion. In the natural environment in which evolution oc-curred, animals are confronted with various hazards, for example, predators, insufficient food and water, or para-sites and pathogens. Mortality is therefore high, so that R. Holliday / HEALTH 2 (2010) 615-619 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 616 most offspring are born to young adults rather than old ones. In this situation there is little, if any, natural selec-tion for a long lifespan. Instead, Darwinian fitness is increased if resources are channeled into reproduction rather than preserving the body indefinitely [11-13]. It has been shown that in 47 mammalian species there is an inverse relationship between fertility and fecundity and longevity in a non-hazardous environment such as a zoo or under domestication [2,14]. (In the case of humans, longevity is highest in developed countries with good health care). It has also become evident that longevity is directly related to the maintenance of function of the various tissues and organs of the body. There are many maintenance mechanisms, which will be listed but not reviewed here: 1) The repair of damage in DNA; 2) The degradation of abnormal protein mole-cules; 3) The defences agai nst reactive oxygen species (ROS); 4) The immune system which provides defences against pathogens and parasites; 5) The detoxification of harmful chemicals in the diet; 6) Proofreading in the synthesis of macromolecules, which removes errors; 7) Wound healing, including the clotting of blood and the repair of broken bones; 8) Epigenetic controls for normal cell functions, and which also prevent the development of cancer; 9) Apoptosis, which removes potentially harmful cells; 10) Physiological homeostasis co-ordi-nating the functions of different cells, tissues and organs; 11) The grooming of hair and skin to remove harmful pests and parasites; 12) The storage of fat as an energy reserve. In this list there is no reference to a central component of cell function, namely, RNA (apart from proofreading in its synthesis). This is largely due to lack of informa- tion. RNA transmits information in DNA to proteins, The translation of RNA into proteins depends on transfer RNAs and ribosomes (which consist of proteins and RNA). There is also the acc urate splicing of RNA tran- scripts. The regulatory role of small RNAs has recently been demonstrated in normal cells. It would be surpris- ing if 1) there were not impo rtant controls of all these functions, and 2) there were no age-related changes in RNA metabolism and function. However, they remain to be discovered. Most of the listed maintenance mechanisms are scien- tific disciplines in their own right, and together they de- pend on a considerable proportion of the resources available to an animal. It should also be noted that a large number of genes are necessary to code for all the proteins and enzymes that are needed for each mecha-nism. These genes in one way or another have an effect on the process of aging. There have been many comparative studies that clearly demonstrate that long-lived species have more efficient maintenance mechanis ms than short lived ones. These have been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere [2], and since that time more evidence has been pub-lished [5,15-17]. Only a few examples can be mentioned here. The same chemical cross links occur more rapidly in bovine skin than human skin [18]. In rats, carcinomas are far more frequently than they do in humans, with an approximately 30-fold difference in the rate of onset [19]. Also, somatic mutations in lymphocytes increase about 10 fold during the lifespan of mice and humans. How-ever, this increase occurs over about three years in mice and 80 years in humans [20]. It has been shown that the defences against ROS corre late with mammalian life- span [16,21,22]. It has also been shown that these de- fences are much more efficient in the pigeon, which is long lived, than the rat, a short lived animal of similar size and metabolic rate [23]. A similar difference was demonstrated between small long-lived birds (canary and parakeet) and the short lived mouse [24]. From all these studies it can be concluded that it is the eventual decline in maintenance that brings about aging. 3. CAUSES OF AGING How does the decline or loss of maintenance give rise to aging? To answer this question we need to consider many of the events that actually occur during aging (2,15). It is known that chromosomal changes and also mutations increase during aging. There may be addi-tional damage to DNA which is not recognized by repair enzymes and simply accumulates with time [25]. Many studies document deletions in mitochondrial DNA. Ab-normalities in nuclear DNA can result in age-associated carcinomas. Altered proteins appear in many locations. Collagen and elastin become cross-linked, which is a cause of hardening of the arteries. The loss of elasticity of artery walls can increase blood pressure, and this can result in kidney damage and also strokes. Many types of protein react with glucose and other carbohydrates to produce advanced glycation products (AGEs). These are high molecular weight aggreg ates that can occur in many locations. There is also the accumulation of lipofuscin, also known as the \"age pi gment\", which is a complex mixture of many degradation pr oducts. This is also seen in many tissues during agin g. Recently there has been much interest in epigenetic events during aging, and particularly \"epigenetic drift\" [26-28]. These events may be due to changes in DNA methylation and histone modification, which in turn can change gene expression. There may be irregularities in hormone function or me-tabolism, for example, late on set diabetes is caused by a failure of the normal controls of insulin levels, or to changes in insulin receptors. In the brain, neurons may R. Holliday / HEALTH 2 (2010) 615-619 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 617617 be lost or become abno rmal, producing the amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which give rise to Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. In the vascular system, atheromatous plaques can form on the inner wall of the major arteries and these impair normal blood flow. This is a major cause of heart disease. The valves of the heart can become calcified, which is another component of the disease. Although muscle tissue can to some ex-tent repair itself, over a long period of time cells are lost and not replaced. Aging is fr equently associated with loss of hearing and sight. The long lived protein crystal-lin becomes denatured and loses transparency, and this result in the appearance of lens cataracts. Retinopathy is largely due to the failure to remove protein aggregates that are the end products of the continual turnover of photoreceptors in the cells of the retina. The age-associ- ated diseases of osteoporos is and osteoarthritis, are due to a decline in normal bone metabolism and the accu-mulation of damage in bone joints. Another example of multiple events giving rise to disease is the gradual loss of kidney glomeruli and eventually renal failure. 4. MULTIPLE EVENTS The previous section is only a summary of some of the changes that can occur during aging. They are sufficient to demonstrate that multiple events at the molecular and cellular level can bring about very significant changes in tissues and organs. These in turn can bring about ill health and disease during ageing. However, not all age associated multiple events are pathological. A good ex- ample is the whitening of hair. This is due to the loss of melanocytes in hair follicles, and the loss of hair follicles themselves results in baldness. One of the most obvious effects of aging is on the skin, and this provides a rough measure of a person's age. Sk in changes are due to loss of elasticity, wrinkling, and often the accumulation of pigmented \"age spots\". Leaving aside skin cancers, these cumulative effects are simply part of the aging pheno- type, and do not impair health. A third example is the loss of muscle strength with age, which by itself is not a harmful change, but is can lead to other problems such as falls and broken bones, particularly if the individual also has osteoporosis. It is interesting that these outward manifestations of aging are not pathological. It is the internal changes that eventually produce age-associated disease and a senes-cent phenotype. The longevity of identical twins is more similar that the longevities of sibs. Also, inbred mice which are genetically identical and live in the same en-vironment have quite variable lifespans, and the survival curve of a population of these mice is an S-shaped curve. There is a plateau with no deaths, then slowly increasing mortality, followed by a steeper increase in mortality. Finally, the slope of the curve flattens out and a few \"outliers\" achieve the longest lifespan [29] If this curve is plotted on a logarithmic sc ale, there is again a plateau followed by an exponential decline in surviving animals. This is very similar to observations in radiology, where, for example, a population of viruses is irradiated. Again there is a plateau in surviv al, followed by an exponential decline in survival. This is an example of a multiple hit survival curve. The same can be said of many of the vulnerable components of the body, and taken together this constitutes aging of the whole body. Obviously, there is not complete synchrony in the change and loss of function of one or another tissue or organ system. This can gives rise to a common misconception. For example, it has frequently been said that dementia has nothing to do with ageing because many old people re-tain their mental facilities throughout their lifespan. The same can be said of carcino mas, cardiovascular disease, and so on. A further related and interesting point is that death certificates must spec ify a particular cause or causes of death, it is not pe rmissible for a physician to use the term \"natural aging\". During long periods of evolution some animal species reduce their lifespan, whereas others increase it. Since aging is multi-causal, the evolved changes in the effi-ciency of maintenance must depend on a degree of syn-chrony in the rate that tissues and organs gradually be-come senescent. There would be no selective advantage if one organ system increased (or reduced) its survival time, whilst others did not. This was first clearly stated by John Maynard Smith nearly fifty years ago [30]. 5. THE LOSS OF MOLECULAR FIDELITY In his book What is Life ? Schrodinger [31] discussed the complexity of living organisms. The second law of thermodynamics states that ordered states of atoms and molecules will eventually become disordered. Schrod- inger wrote about organisms feeding on negative entropy. This means that they depend on energy to maintain their complex structures, which is a contravention of the sec-ond law. It is obvious that this is not a permanent situa-tion because aging eventually results in death, and it is after this that disorder prevails. Instead of stating that there are multiple causes of aging, one can instead re-gard the whole process of aging to have just one cause, and this is the loss of molecular fidelity, and gain in en-tropy. This is the viewpoint of Hayflick [4,8]. There is, however, no radical distinction between this one cause of aging and the multiple causes that have been discussed here. The analogy of a motor car helps to explain this. The car is a complex machine that requires R. Holliday / HEALTH 2 (2010) 615-619 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 618 continual service and maintenance. With time it is sub- ject to wear and tear in its component parts which are to some extent independent of each other, but are also es-sential for its normal function. We can equate the loss of molecular fidelity or in- creasing molecular disorder with wear and tear. The component parts of a car cannot be expected to last in-definitely, for example, the gearbox, the electrical sys- tem, the cooling system, the engine, and so on. With time the defects increase and are more and more expen-sive to repair. At a given point in time the car is not worth repairing and reaches the end of its working life. We can conclude that the multiple parts of a car deterio-rate at a given rate, and its life ends as a result on innu-merable cumulative defects, which are the equivalent of \"molecular infidelity\" in an organism. It is also signifi-cant to note that a vintage ca r can be maintained indefi- nitely, but at huge expense. Similarly an animal body could, in principle, be maintained indefinitely, but a cost in resources that would be selectively disadvantageous. Thus all animals, except a few of the simplest, have fi-nite lifespan. 6. CONCLUSIONS The biological reasons for aging are no longer a mystery. The adult organism is a structure capable of reproduction for a given period, but in a natural environment, most offspring are born to young adults because environ-mental hazards limit the lifes pan of parents. The energy resources available to every animal are used for general metabolism, for reproduction and also to maintain the body, or soma. Normal metabolism is obviously essen-tial for life, but there is a trade off between the invest-ment of resources in reproduction and in body mainte-nance, which varies between species. Thus, short lived small species, such as rodents, can have many offspring, whilst large long lived species have few offspring. In the case of the human species, a great deal is known about the changes that occur with aging. Many of these changes affect vital functions which result in a decline in health and eventually to events that cannot be treated at all. Nevertheless, the last few months of life very often depend on medical resources that are increas-ingly expensive, especially in developed countries. In the end, all care and treatments fail, and the elderly indi-vidual dies. It is true to say that aging is almost always associated with a decline in health leading to death.

ABSTRACT To compare remission rate, relapse rate and tolerability of duloxetine, a reuptake inhibitor of 5-HT during follow up period of 16 weeks in major depressive disorder (MDD) a open label comparative trial was conducted. Trial was comprising of 60 patients, diagnosed with MDD, were allocated to fluoxetine group (n*-30, 40-60mg od) for 16 weeks. The end points were remission and relapse assessed by Hamilton Rating scale for Depression-24 items (HAMD-24). In results the mean fall in HAMD-24 scores be- tween groups was comparable till 4 weeks. Thereafter, at 8 weeks the mean fall in HAMD-24 score was significantly greater in duloxetine group (p value < 0.05). At 16 weeks the mean fall was highly significant (p value < 0.01) in du- loxetine group. Thirty percent patients in du- loxetine group achieved remission in compari-son to none in fluoxetine group. None of the patient, in any group, reported relapse. Adverse effects were mild to moderate in severity.In conclusion duloxetine has a better pharmacol- ogical profile over fluoxetine in terms of efficacy and safety.

INTRODUCTION Major depressive disorder (MDD) represents one of the most serious conditions encountered in clinical practice affecting 340 million people globally [1]. It is currently estimated to be the fourth leading cause of disability adjusted life years (DALY) in all age groups. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the treatment of choice for moderate to severe depression [2]. How- ever, studies have shown that up to half of all depressed patients fail to respond to SSRIs treatment. Thus there exists need for alternatives with multiple mechanisms along with avoidance of unwanted effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) [3]. Duloxetine, a newer selective serotonin nor-epinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SSNRI) group, has been approved double blind, placebo cont rolled multicentre, random- 9 weeks trials Gartlehner et al. [5] and Detke et al. [6] concluded that, for treatment of MDD Duloxetine is safe and effective. In 8 weeks, fluoxetine comparator trial, remission rates were high in duloxetine group, but not statistically significantly than fluoxetine group [7]. For long term treatment of MDD duloxetine has been shown to be effective in 52 weeks non-comparator open label multicentre trial [8]. As previous studies indicate that duloxetine may have some advantages in MDD, however there are limited numbers of studies which assess SSRIs as active com- parators [9]. These studies are lacking with data's either duo to of short duration of study or duo to of lack of standard comparator. Therefore the current study was planned to compare remission rate, relapse rate and safety of oral duloxetine ( SSNRI) with fluoxetine (SSRI) in 16 weeks comparative study. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS An open label study was conducted in the Department of R. K. Sah et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 620-624 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 621621 Pharmacology in collaboration with the Department of Medical College and associ- ated Smt. Sucheta Kriplani (SSK) Hospital, New Delhi. Sixty six Patients, aged between 18 and 65 years with either sex, presenting with MDD, as per ICD-10 DCR criteria [10], on an outpatient basis, were included after obtaining an informed consent. The study protocol was approved by Institution Ethics Committee. Baseline dis- ease severity was defined by patients' scores on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-24 items (HAMD- 24) [11]. Exclusion criteria were history of psychosis or bipolar disorder, substance abuse disorder, intake of psychoactive medication during past two weeks. Patients with serious medical illness, serious suicidal risk requir- ing hospitalization and pregnant or lactating women were also excluded from study. A complete workup was done for all patients with respect to history, baseline in- vestigations (weight, blood pressure, hemoglobin, com- plete blood count, blood sugar, serum electrolyte, kidney and liver function test) and clinical examinations. All patients were randomly assigned to Fluoxetine 20-60 mg per oral (FLX) and Duloxetine 40-60 mg per oral (DLX) group. Both the study drugs were adminis-tered daily for 16 weeks and dose was titrated as per the need of patient. 3. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF PATIENTS Clinical response of the patients was assessed at baseline (0 week), 1 week, 2 week, 4 week, 8 week and 16 week by using HAMD-24 scale. Improvement in HAMD-24 score from baseline was used as the primary efficacy measure to assess remission and relapse. Remission was defined as a total score on HAMD-24 of 7 and relapse was defined as an episode of MDD that occurs within 6 months after either response or remission [12]. 4. SAFETY PROFILE The patients were monitored for any adverse drug effects during the course of study. The patients as well as the informants were asked in detail about any adverse drug effects the course of treatment on each visit. 5. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline and end-point HAMD-24 scores were com- pared within groups using the paired student's t-test. Unpaired student's t-test was used for comparison of parameters between two study groups. Safety profile and response rate were compared between two treatment groups by Fisher's exact test. P value of < 0.05 was taken to be significant. 6. RESULTS A total of 66 patients enrolled, out of which 60 com- pleted the study. Biosocial and demographic characteris- tics of patients were comparable ( Table 1 ). Baseline bodyweight, pulse rate, blood pressure and biochemical parameters in both the groups were matching. On com- pletion of treatment there were reduction in mean body weight in both groups which was statistically significant (P < 0.05). In FLX group bodyweight reduced from 59.27 \u00b1 1.93 kg to 58.84 \u00b1 1.84 kg (p value < 0.05) while in DLX group body weight reduced from 57.37 \u00b1 1.53 kg to 56.77 \u00b1 1.52 kg after 16 weeks. In DLX group blood sugar levels also reduced significantly (p value < 0.05) from 104.60 \u00b1 2.33 mg/dl to 102.73 \u00b1 2.03 mg/dl while there was statistically significant rise in hemoglo- bin at end of the study. The mean values of other pa- rameters after16 week were comparable within as well as between the both groups. 7. CLINICAL RESPONSE (EFFICACY) Baseline HAMD-24 scores in FLX and DLX groups ( cantly from 17.46 \u00b1 0.13 to 16.16 \u00b1 0.19 (p value < 0.05) after first week followed by 16.3 \u00b1 0.19, 14.8 \u00b1 0.19, 12 \u00b1 0.15 and 9.9 \u00b1 0.14 HAMD-24 scores respectively at 2 weeks, 4 week, 8 week and 16 week. Similarly in DLX group the score reduced significantly from 17.70 \u00b1 0.08 to 16.80 \u00b1 \u00b1 14.86 \u00b1 0.20, 11.10 \u00b1 0.24 and 8.06 \u00b1 0.15 HAMD-24 Table 1.

At 16 weeks the mean fall was highly significant (p value < 0.01) in DLX group vs. the FLX group ( Table 2). 8. REMISSION AND RELAPSE In FLX group there was no remission till 16 weeks of treatment, where as in DLX group 9 patients remitted with in 16 weeks. None of the patient, in any group, re- ported relapse of any sign or symptoms of MDD during study period. 9. ADVERSE DRUG EVENTS A total of 99 adverse events were recorded in FLX group as compared to 37 adverse events in DLX group. Nausea was frequent adverse events in FLX group as compared to DLX. Insomnia, sweating and diarrhoea were the other frequent adverse events observed in FLX group. Nausea, dry mouth, diarrhoea and fatigue constituted the frequent adverse events in DLX group. These adverse effects were mild to moderate and there were no serious adverse event in both the groups ( Table 3 ). 10. DISCUSSION After one week of treatment , overall fall in HAMD-24 score was greater in DLX group than FLX group. In DLX (20 mg twice daily) group, reduction in HAMD-24 score at 8 and 16 weeks from baseline value was -6.6 and -9.64 whereas in FLX (20 mg once daily) fall was -5.4 and -7.5. Similarly, Goldstein et al. (2002) reported a higher fall in HAMD scores with duloxetine Table 3. Adverse drug events observed in the two treatment groups. Adverse Event FLX (n-99) DLX (n-37) Nausea 17 (12.1%) (5.4%) 3 Dizziness 2 3 Somnolence 0 (5.4%) 14 (14.1%) (8.1%) 15 (15.1%) 1 (2.7%) Anxiety 3 (3%) 0 Ejaculation delayed 3 (3%) 0 (n- Number of total adverse events) (-9.73) than with fluoxetine (-7.75) or placebo (-6.6) in an 8 week study [7]. Hudson et al . (2007) reported higher reduction in HAMD-24 scores at 12 weeks with duloxetine (60 mg/day) [1]. The early and higher re- sponse rate may be due to higher dose of duloxetine. In present 16 week study and previous short period studies, duloxetine shown to have better efficacy than SSRIs, which may be due to its combined effects on both the serotonin and norepinephrine systems. This dual mecha- nism makes duloxetine potent (4.5 times) and to act faster than SSRIs [1,13]. Also, when compared with other dual action antidepress ants like venlafaxine, du- loxetine appears to inhibitor of sero- tonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Further, experimental data predicted that dual serotonin and norepinephrine exert analgesic effects via descending pain pathways; therefore duloxetine is more suitable in depression with somatic symptoms [1]. In this study response rate from one week onward was 100% in both the groups and remission rate was 33% and 0% in DLX and FLX group respectively at end of 16 weeks. Goldstein D.J. et al . (2002) also reported re- sponse and remission rate of 64% and 56% respectively for du- loxetine (20 mg twice daily), compared with 52% and 30% for fluoxetine (20 mg once daily) and 48% and 32% for placebo, indicates superior efficacy of duloxet- ine over Fluoxetine [7]. In another 8 weeks trial, Gold- stein DJ (2004) showed response and remission rates were 54% and 37% for duloxetine (40 mg once daily), 60% and 58% for duloxetine (80 mg) in comparison to R. K. Sah et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 620-624 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 623623 50% and 34% for paroxetine (20 mg daily) and 30% and 28% for pl acebo [14]. In a metanalysis by Jen- nifer et al . (2006) the remission rate was found to be superior for duloxetine as compared to SSRIs (43% vs. 38%). Also when alternative definition of remission (MADRS score 12) was used, duloxetine was found to be sig- nificantly better than SSRIs [9]. In both groups there was no relapse till 16 weeks. Al- though the study duration of 4 months is not sufficient to comment upon relapse rate but as per definition of re- lapse there was no reoccurrence of sign and symptoms after response has been establish in both groups. Relapse rate for the fluoxetine group was found to be 35.2% after 6 month and 45.9% after 1 year of treatment [15]. In randomized double blind, multicenter, placebo con- trolled, parallel group study, David G .P. et al. (2006) showed that duloxetine (60 mg once daily) was effective in the prevention of relapse of MDD during continuation of treatment [16]. Geddes et al. (2003) had concluded on systemic review of 31 antidepressant trials that continu- ing with antidepressant reduced the odds of depressive relapse by 70% compared to placebo. This suggests con- tinued antidepressant treatment has ability to reduce the chances of depressive relapse [17]. Duloxetine has better adverse effect profile. In DLX group 30% of patients experienced adverse events in which nausea (26.7%) and dry mouth (16.7%) were principally reported. Other adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, dizziness and vomiting. Sharma A. et al. (2000) have also reported similar adverse effect profile for du- loxetine [18]. As a reuptake inhibitor of norepinephrine, duloxetine has been found to be associated with mean increase in heart rate as well as blood pressure (less than 2 mmHg) [8]. No such cardiovascular adverse effect was observed in this study .In FLX group, patients mainly reported nausea (56.6%) and insomnia (50%) followed by other adverse events which includes sweating, diar- rhea, anorexia, vomiting, dry mouth and anxiety. In a study of 6 months, Zajecka et al. (1999) have reported similar adverse events [19]. Ejaculation delayed was reported by 3 male patients (10%) in FLX group. Similarly Harman J.B. et al. (1990) also reported frequent sexual dysfunction with Fluoxet- ine [20]. Comparatively in DLX group, there was no sexual dysfunction occurred in any patients although it has been reported by Detke M.J. et al. (2002) [21]. All the adverse effects during study period were mild to moderate severity. On the WHO casualty assessment scale they were classified as possible. Favorable adverse effect profile of duloxetine may be because of its less affinity CONCLUSIONS In this comparative study duloxetine was found to be more efficacious than fluoxe tine in reducing HAMD-24 score in 16 weeks as well as found to have better adverse effect profile than fluoxetine. This suggests that for treatment of MDD duloxetine is better option over fluoxetine. REFERENCES Detke, M.J. (2007) Duloxetine in the treat- ment of major depressive disorder: and Silver, E.S.

ABSTRACT Bacterial pathogens and drug resistance are different in hospitals of each country. In this study we determined bacterial path- ogens and drug sensitivity in the neonatal ward and neo-natal intensive care unit (NICU) in Ekbatan hos-pital in Hamedan. This cross-sectional descrip-tive study done on 1150 hospitalized neo-nates in neonatal and NICU wards of Ekbatan hospital of the Hamadan university of medical sciences from September 2004 to September 2006. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), urine, stool, eye excretion, synovial fluid, umbilical secretion and ascitic fluid were evaluated. Posi-tive cultures were evaluated for antibiotic re-sistance with disk diffusion test methed. All of the data in questionnaires was analyzed with SPSS 13. Cultures including blood, urine, CSF , stool, eye excretion, synovial fluid, umbilical secretion and ascitic fluid was done in 417 neonates (833 cultures). These cultures were including: urine, 323 cases (38.8%) blood 293 cases (35.2%), CSF cases (21.6%) 17 secretion 16 cases and other secretions (synovial, umbilical, etc) 4 cases (0.5%). The cultures were positive in 105 cases (25.2%). 60 male neonates (57.1%) and 45 female neonates (42.9%) were culture positive. The most common microorganisms were E coli 66.7% (70 cases), Klebsiella 10.5% (11 cases). Drug resistance was high in these microorgan-isms. The most common microorganisms were Ecoli and klebsiella. Drug resistance was high in the isolated microorganisms. Keywords: Drug Resistance; Neonate; Bacterial Infections 1. INTRODUCTION There has been high incidence of antimicrobial resis- tance in bacterial infections in different parts of a coun- try and also in any hospital [1-3]. Different mechanisms are involved in drug resistance of microorganisms. It may be genetic or non genetic in origin [4]. Widespread use of broadspectrum antibiotics is the most important factor, so antibiotic control policy has great importance in drug resistance control [5 ]. The incidence of infec- tions in hospitalized neonates is very high. After wide- spread use of antibiotics in agriculture industry and medicine from 1950, antibiotics resistance in common pathogenic agents had increasingly emerged [6]. In de-veloped countries constant investigation in this field had done for identifying antibiotic resistance pattern. Re- cently, the spectrum and resi stance of the pathogenic bacteria have constantly changed year after year because of wide application of antimicrobial drugs [5-9]. It is necessary to treat neonatal infections by empirical use of antimicrobial drugs as soon as possible to reduce the mortality of them. It is based on the knowledge of epi-demiology of bacterial susceptibility pattern in each area [6-15]. This study had done for identifying antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in a western province of Iran in neonatal ward to help the treatment of infected neonates. 2. MATERIAL AND METHOD This cross-sectional descriptive study was done on 1150 hospitalized neonates in neonatal and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) wards of Ekbatan hospital of the Hamadan University of Medical Sciences from Septem-ber 2004 to September 2006. Approval from Hamadan University of Medical Sciences was obtained prior the study. All of the samples that had sent for bacteriological analysis entered the study. They included blood, cere-bro-spinal fluid (CSF), urine, stool, eye excretion, syno-A. Monsef et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 625-629 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

In case of bacterial growth, identification of the bacteria had done and antibiogram by disc diffusion method had performed (Karbibauer method, Padtan Teb antibiotic disc Company). The quality control modalities had done on the Na- tional Reference Laboratory of Health standards. The antibiotics susceptibility test results had entered the questionnaires. The data had analyzed by SPSS software (version 13). 3. RESULTS A total of 1150 hospitalized neonates entered the study. There were 417 cultured samples, 239 cases (56.1%) were male and 183 cases (43.9%) were female. The mean age of neonates was 11.3 \u00b1 9.3 days, (1 to 30 days). We found 833 cultures in 417 cases, they included: urine culture 322 (38.7%), blood culture 293 (35.2%), CSF culture 180 (21.6%), 17 ...) 5 (0.6%). In this study 25.5% of the cultures were positive and 74.8% were negative. 57.1% (60 neonates) of positive cultures were male and remaining 42.9% (45 neonates) were female. Eye excretion was the most positive culture (81.2%). (Table 1 ) Table 1 shows the results of cultures. The most frequent isolated microorganisms were E.coli 66.7% (70 cases) and Kl ebciella 10.5% (11 cases) in decreasing order ( Figure 1 ). Table 2 shows the frequency of isolated bacteria in the culture. Table 3 shows the sensitivity and resistance pattern of bacteria cultured in urine culture. Tables 4 and 5 reveal of the bacterial susceptibility tests in the neonates. 4. DISCUSSION Bacterial infection is still prevalent in newborns and it is a major medical problem [1-3]. According to the euro- pean countries reports, its prevalence had not changes in previous half decade, wherea s bacterial etiologic agents had changed. From 1928 to 1932 beta hemolytic strep- tococci with 38% prevalence and staphylococcus aurous with 28% were the most frequent causes of septicemia, although the former is not so prevalent yet [13-14]. In the present study Escherichi a coli (Ecoli) was 66.7% and Klebciella was 10.5%, they were the more frequent bac- teria isolated from urine, blood and eye excretion cul tures. Ecoli was the most freq uent isolated bacteria from urine, eye excretion and blood cultures in an order of Table 1.

Yalaz et al. in Turkey studied 909 newborns, 9.1% of them had sepsis, the isolated bacteria were: 10.5% in order [11]. Another study of Aurangzeb et al . at 2003 revealed 112 hospitalized newborns as sepsis, 67% had positive blood culture and E.coli was the most frequent cause with 77.1% frequency [12]. Bacterial meningitis has various ethologic factors and majority of authors believe that its agents varies according to age and geographic distribution [1,3,15,16]. In present study we did not found any positive cerebrospinal fluid culture in the newborns. In our study E.coli, the most prevalent iso-lated microorganism, shows high degree resistance to cephalosporins. It showed 75.9% resistance in urine cul-ture to Ceftriaxone, and 60% to Ceftizoxime ( Table 3 ). When we separated the E.coli from the blood and eye excretion cultures, most of them were resistant to Cepha-losporins specially to Ceftri axone. Also E.coli was Gentamycin and Tobramycin. ( Tables 4, 5 ) In our study the resistance of E.coli to the Ciprofloxacin, Nalidixic acid, Nitrofurantoin and Cotrimoxazol were in a decreasing order ( Tables 3, 4, 5 ) .These findings are consistent with the results of a similar study [15]. Au- rangzeb et al. in a similar study showed high degree re- sistance of gram negative bacteria to conventional anti-biotics: showed 75% resistance to Ampicillin [12]. The present study revealed high per-centage resistance of staphylococcus aurous to cepha-losporin and other broad spectrum antibiotics. Table 3.

CONCLUSIONS Our experience showed that gram-negative bacteria were the most prevalent cause of infections in neonates in our hospital. E.coli and Klebsiella were the most frequent bacteria and majority of them were resistant to broad spectrum antibiotics. Drug resistance to conventional antibiotics is a common problem and it grows readily. Antimicrobials must be administered conservatively according to epidemiologic st udies in the region, with confirmed indications, and based on the results of sus-ceptibility tests. 6.

ABSTRACT Nowadays pollution of the environment is one of the major problems of mankind. Moreover, studying of the effect of different kinds of med- icine on selected, specially bred, non-exposed to external pollutants animals is becoming dis- tant from reality. Thus in this work we have in- vestigated the modifying action of heavy metals on anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin. The in- vestigation were carried out on rats which were injected during 7 days intraperitoneally by PbCl 3, HgCl 2, CdCl 2 in concentration of 100, 20, 1 mg/kg accordingly, modulating accumulation of the metals in the organism tissues. On the 8 days inflammation was invoked by formalin. As anti-inflammatory medicine was use aspirin. Judging by obtained results the conclusion can be drawn that cadmium in concentration 1 mg/kg significantly increases anti-inflammatory aspirin activity. The observed outcome can be explained in the following way. It is generally known that zinc in a certain concentration demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties. Be- ing an element of the same group cadmium has similar properties and also can have anti-in- flammatory action. Lead and mercury suppre- ssed anti-inflammatory aspirin activity. Obvious inhibitory action of mercury and lead salts on aspirin action related to the fact that these ele-ments by themselves were inflammation factors. From the obtained results the following conclu- sion can be drawn: a definite dose of anti-in-flammatory medicine (aspirin) which is suffi- cient in normal conditions became less effective against the background of accumulation of ions of some heavy metals in an INTRODUCTION Nowadays pollution of the environment is one of the major problems of mankind. Long-term observations show that pollution by heavy metals occurs not only in anthropogenic areas but also in the distance from the sources of pollution [1]. Exhausts, sewers, emissions of the factories pollute cities and this is just a small part of what influences our environment. As lots of agricultural lands are subjected to anthropogenic influence foodstuff often contains a maximum permissible dose of heavy metals. In its turn heavy metals which enter an organism with food are especially dang erous because they are in conjunction with biologically-active substances and rather easily penetrate through natural barriers thus vio-lating normal organism functioning [2-4]. A characteris-tic feature of all heavy meta ls that increases danger is their cumulation and very slow excretion. So even if the elements come to an organism in small doses which are within the bounds of the norm their concentrations will increase to a harmful level with a lapse of time. We may say that heavy metals accumulate in any human organism living in the condition of high anthropogenic development [5,6]. Their toxic effect both on separate organs and on physiological and mental state of an or-ganism is well known [5,7]. But along with this fact such high concentration of heavy metals significantly modi-fies not only physiological state of an organism but also its reaction to the influence of various chemical sub-stances including pharmaceutical ones. Moreover, stud- ying of the effect of different kinds of medicine on se-lected, specially bred, non-ex posed to external pollutants animals is becoming distant from reality. Thus in this work we have investigated the modifying action of heavy metals on anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin. 2. MATERIALS AND METHODS The investigations were carried out on white outbred male rats weighing between 140-180 grams. The group D. R. Husainov et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 630-633 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 631631 of rats was divided into 4 subgroups 10 rats in each group. One of the subgroups served as a control one. These rats were not subjected to the influence of heavy metals. For the estimation of the modifying action of heavy metals the 3 subgroups of rats were injected dur-ing seven days intraperitoneally by PbCl 3, HgCl 2, CdCl 2 in concentration of 100, 20 , 1 mg/kg accordingly, modu- lating accumulation of the metals in the organism tissues. On the eighth day inflammation of soft tissues of hind legs was invoked in all the 4 subgroups of the rats. The inflammatory process was stimulated by subcutaneous introduction of 0.2 ml of 1% solution of formalin into the rat hind leg-the so called \"formalin test\". Then aspi-rin was injected to the subgroups intraperitoneally in a form of solution at a rate of 40 mg/kg. Measurements of size of a swollen limb began at the thirtieth minute after the injection. 8 measurements were done with the inter-val of 12 minutes. In all the solutions physiological solu-tion was a dissolvent. The results of the experiments were calculated statistically using Mann-Whitney U test. During the experiments all the ethic norms were ob-served. 3. RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS 3.1. Modifying Action of Lead on Anti-Inflammatory Aspirin Action The analysis of the dynamics of the change of aspirin anti-inflammatory activity against the background of increased lead concentration revealed some degradation of therapeutic activity of acet ylsalicylic acid. But analy- sis didn't show essential differences in comparison with the control subgroup as significant differences (p < 0.05) are marked just only for one measuring position\u2014the sixtieth minute from the beginning of the measurement. Values of the dimensions of inflamed rat leg in the con-trol subgroup and the experimental subgroup did not have significant differences in all the rest time intervals. But despite this fact kinetics of rat leg dimensions of the control subgroup had practically linear dependence and went in lesser values in comparison with the same pa-rameter in the subgroup of rats that was subjected to lead influence. The picture of change of inflamed limb color was also important: intensity of red color significantly decreased in control subgroup by the end of the experi-ments and on the contrary it remained lilac-red in the experimental subgroup. Summarizing all received results one could conclude that lead showed antagonistic inter-action with anti-inflammatory aspirin activity. 3.2. Modifying Action of Mercury Comparative analysis of time dynamics of swollen limb dimensions in a control subgroup with the subgroup of rats that was injected with mercury allowed to reveals the following: significant differences of swollen limb dimensions were marked starting from the sixtieth min-ute of the measurements (level of significance is shown in the table). If take a look at the graph ( Figure 2(a) ) can see clear differences between two subgroups that point undoubtedly to an inhibitory mercury action on anti-in-flammatory aspirin activity. At the same time the differ-ence of swollen limb dimension of the rats that were subjected to mercury action and the rats from the control subgroup happened to exceed 30%. Judging by obtained results the conclusion can be drawn that mercury ions significantly suppressed anti-inflammatory aspirin activ-ity.

Modifying Action of Cadmium Evaluating the results obtained in series of experiments with the rat subgroup that wa s receiving injections of cadmium salt an opposite effect was revealed as to two the previous metals. Dynamics of change of swollen limb dimension in the experimental subgroup demon-strated its agonistic action to aspirin. Analyzing the val-ues of swollen limb dimensions displayed in Figure 3 , it got obvious that with cadmium injections they were less than in the control subgroup. In spite of relatively small differences they were statistically significant beginning with the first measurement and significantly lesser in comparison with the control subgroup. Given results was an evidence that cadmium improves anti-inflammatory properties of acetylsalicylic acid and the chosen concen-tration increases the effectiveness of this medicine.

DISCUSSION Thus the results of the experiments explicitly demon- strated that heavy metals noticeably changed therapeutic aspirin activity. Obvious inhibitory action of mercury and lead salts on aspirin action related to the fact that these elements by themselv es are inflammation factors [8,9]. From the obtained results the following conclusion can be drawn: a definite dose of anti-inflammatory medicine (aspirin) which is sufficient in normal condi-tions became less effective ag ainst the background of accumulation of ions of some heavy metals in an organ-ism. The pattern of modifying action of cadmium salt had another direction. Acetylsalicylic acid showed much stronger anti-inflammatory action against the background D. R. Husainov et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 630-633 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 633633 of cadmium accumulation in a rat's organism. The ob- served outcome can be explained in the following way. It is generally known that zinc in a certain concentration demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties. Being an element of the same group cadmium has similar proper-ties and also can have anti-inflammatory action [10-13]. Besides, the observed properties of the metals can be explained through the mechanism of salicylate and aspi-rin action. As its generally known salicylate action is associated with the inhibition of the synthesis of pros-taglandins of various classes that are responsible for penetrability of vessels, edema, chemotaxis. Prostag- landins occur in tissues in trace amount but their con-centration increases sharply un der the influence of toxic substances and some hormones [14]. First of all inhibi-tion of prostaglandin synthesis under salicylate action is associated with ferment i nhibition videlicet cyclooxy- genase (COG). The latter leads to from arachidonic acid of anti-inflammatory prostaglan- dins potentiating the is known prostaglandins invoke hyperalgesia i.e. improve no- ciceptor sensitivity to chemical and mechanical stimuli. Prostaglandin synthesis inhibition stanch/remove pain, reduce inflammatory reaction and feverish body tem-perature as well. So a basic anti-inflammatory mecha-nism of salicylates is COG inhibition but at the same time mercury and lead are t oxic substances that invoke additional inflow of prostaglandins to the place of in-flammation and that determinates their property to inten-sify inflammatory process. Regarding cadmium anti- inflammatory effect the following can be added: as is generally known heavy metals can violate ferment in-teraction due to inhibiting some enzymes. Therefore it is quite possible that cadmium inhibits the synthesis of ferments which participate in the formation of the me-diator of inflammation and it determined anti-inflam-matory influence of the metal and improves aspirin ef-fectiveness. 5. CONCLUSIONS 1) It is revealed that lead, mercury and cadmium cumu-lation significantly modified inflammation process flow. Degree and character of inflammation depended on the metal that is accumulated. 2) A tendency of inhibition of acetylsalicylic acid ac- tion was traced for lead. Mercury clearly demonstrated pro-inflammatory effect. On the contrary, cadmium im-proved anti-inflammation actio n of acetylsalicylic acid. 3) Taking into consideration the obtained results a correction of a therapeutic dose with the adjustment to the level of heavy metals content in an organism be-comes actual.

ABSTRACT Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) remains an important emergency situation. In the last two decades, major developments took place influencing incidence, etiology and out- come of patients with acute UGIB. Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most significant complication of ulcer disease being responsible for 50% of all cases mortality. Aim of the study : To compare between endoscopic clip application versus argon plasma coagulation in management of bleeding peptic ulcer (BPU). Patients and Meth- ods: Sixty patients suffering from acute UGIB were randomly divided into two groups: group I included 30 patients treated with endoscopic clip application and Group II included 30 pa-tients subjected to endoscopic APC. All patients were classified according to Forrest classifica- tion and the clinical Rockall score. Results: There were significant differences between the two groups as regard Forrest classification (P < 0.05) there were insignificant difference be-tween the two groups as regard rockall score, site of the ulcer and re bleeding (P > 0.05). Re bleeding was significant with higher Rockall score in group I (P < 0.05) but it was insignifi- cant in group II (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Endo- scopic application of hemoclips have a less re bleeding rate than Argon plasma coagulation for treatment of bleeding peptic ulcer, although this was statistically insignificant, meanwhile APC is still less cost and easy. Clinical and endoscopic assessment (through Rokcall score and Forrest classification) could help in making best choice for endoscopic management.

INTRODUCTION Since the late 1980s, endoscopic haemostatic therapy has been widely accepted as the first-line therapy for up- per-gastrointestinal bleeding. Most clinical trials demon- strated a reduction in both recurrent bleeding and the need for surgical interven tion when endoscopic hemo- stasis was used [1]. Endoscopic therapy can be broadly categorized into injection th erapy, thermal coagulation, and mechanical hemostasis. When analyzed separately, injection therapy, thermal-contact devices, and me-chanical treatment all decr ease the frequency of recur- rent bleeding and rate of surgical intervention [2]. Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a non contact type of co-agulation that is easier to target to bleeding sites. A high-frequency current is transmitted by the ionized, electrically conductive argon gas. The argon gas flows onto the target surface, even if approached tangentially. APC has been used successfully to obtain hemostasis during open surgery. The use of APC in digestive tract endoscopy was first described in 1994. It is being ap- plied more and more widely in the treatment of different GI pathologic disorders, hemorrhagic lesions in particu-lar [3]. The only mechanical therapies widely available are endoscopically placed clips and band ligation de-vices. Endoscopic clips usua lly are placed over a bleed- ing site (e.g. visible vessel) and left in place [4]. This consisted of a stainless steel clip (of size approximately 6 mm long and 1.2 mm wide at the prongs) with a metal deployment device (that could be used to insert the clip into the endoscopic camera, and deployed outside the camera) enclosed in a plastic sheath. These clips were H. S. Assal et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 634-638 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly initially reloadable [5]. Numerous prognostic scores have been devised to aid the gastroenterologist in the management of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding, strati-fying individual patients by risk of re-bleeding and death. These scores range from th e simple, endoscopy-based analysis of ulcer appearance described by Forrest et al. [6], through pre-endoscopic c linical scores such as the 'clinical' Rockall scores [7], to combined clinical and endoscopic evaluation, best exemplified by the classical Rockall [8]. Such a scheme should aid in making clinical decisions, as to both the need for urgent intervention and the prediction of continued or recurrent bleeding in the context of endoscopic therapy [9]. The purpose of this study was designed to compare between endoscopic clip applications versus argon plasma coagulation in management of bleeding peptic ulcer. 2. PATIENTS AND METHODS This study was conducted on 60 patients (30 males with mean age 50.8 \u00b1 8.9 and 30 females with mean age 49.7 \u00b1 9.8) between January 2007 and August 2008, all pa-tients admitted to Ain-Shams University Hospital, pre-senting with hematemesis. After fluid resuscitation, the patients underwent endoscopy of the upper gastrointes-tinal tract within 12 hours of admission. Those with duodenal, gastric, or stomal ulcers and stigmata of recent hemorrhage were enrolled in the study. The patients were selected according to Forrest classification between groups IA (spurting bleeding) to IIB (non bleeding ulcer with an adherent clot). A score was calculated to them according to Rockall's score. Patients were excluded from the study if they had se- vere terminal illness that made endoscopic examination hazardous or unde sirable; profuse hemorrhage accompa- nied by persistent shock, during which the upper gastro-intestinal tract was filled with fresh blood, limiting visi-bility through the endoscope and necessitating emer-gency surgery as a procedure; or bleeding from a Mallory\u2014Weiss tear, varices, erosions, tumors, or an unknown source. All patients gave informed consent and the study was approved by the Institutional Ethical Committee. All participants were subjected to: Resuscitation including IV fluids, packed RBC trans- fusion until becomes hemodynamically stable. Routine laboratory investigations: complete blood count, liver function and kidney function tests, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time. Upper GIT endoscopy was done. Patients with selec- tion criteria of bleeding ulcer were divided into two groups: Group I: Consisting of 30 patients subjected to clip application using a metallic clips (Hemoclip), Group II: Consisting of 30 patients in whom Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) was done using an argon plasma coagulator unit. Clip application device: clip application was done us- ing a metallic clips (Hemoclip; Olympus America, rota- tional clip fixing device HX'6UR'1 through flexible endoscopes). The clip fixing device length is 23 mm and maximum insertion portion diameter is 2.8 mm with processing port. Clips are loaded onto the fixing device and drawn into a sheath. At the target lesion, the clip is advanced out of the sheath, oriented with the rotational handle, and then deployed. The mechanism of hemosta- sis is mechanical compression [10]. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) was done using an argon plasma coagulator unit (TERNO ABC TOM 201, Germany). Spray mode was used with 2 power/gas set- tings (respectively, 40 and 70 W and 1.5 to 3 L/min). Probe of 2.3 mm was used with endoscopes with corre-sponding channel diameters (2 .8 mm diameter accessory channels). The maximum coagulation depth achieved by APC is 3 to 4 mm, which minimizes the risk of perfora-tion. Continuous suction was applied to remove smoke and prevent over inflation of the GIT [3]. Follow up : After endoscopy, all patients were closely monitored clinically for one weak looking for symptoms and signs of bleeding. All patients received the same proton pump inhibitor, and Blood transfusion was given to maintain the hemoglobin level above 8 g/dL. Clinical recurrent bleeding was defined as signs of bleeding: vomiting of fresh blood, passage of melena with pulse rate higher than 100beat/min , decrease in systolic blood pressure exceeding 30 mmHg, after the early stabiliza-tion of pulse, blood pressure, and or decrease in hemo-globin concentration by at least 2 g/dL over a 24-hour period. In case of re bleeding endoscopy was repeated as an emergency procedure and the same primary endoscopic management was used. Indications for surgery ; where failed endoscopic treatment on second endoscopy, re-currence of bleeding after a second therapeutic endo- scopy, or a total blood transf usion requirement of greater than 8 units to maintain a hemoglobin level of 10 g/dL. 2.1. Statistical Analysis Data were statistically described in terms of mean \u00b1 standard deviation (\u00b1 SD). Chi-square test of significance was used in order to compare proportions between two categorical variables. For comparing between two mean s, t-test of significance was done and one way analysis of variance ANOV A was used when comparing between more than two means. When data were not normally distributed, nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used for comparing between H. S. Assal et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 634-638 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes.

All statistical calculations were done using computer programs Microsoft Excel version 7 (Microsoft Corpo-ration, NY , USA) and SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), version 16, statistical program. 2.2. Results The characteristic stigmata of bleeding ulcers according to their appearance at endoscopy were listed in Table 1 , there was insignificant difference between the 2 groups regarding the presence of ulcer with visible or with ooz- ing vessel (P > 0.05). Table 2 shows significant difference between the 2 groups regarding Forrest's classification (P < 0.05). Table 3 shows insignificant di fference between the 2 groups regarding the Rockall'S Score (P > 0.05). Table 4 shows the characteristic stigmata of bleeding ulcers according to their site at endoscopy, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups regarding presence of gastric or duodenal ulcer (P > 0.05). There was a highly significant difference in re bleed- ing incidence in different Forrest's classes in group I (P < 0.01), while there was insi gnificant difference in re bleeding incidence in different Forrest's classes in group II (P > 0.05) as shown in Table 5 . Also there was a significant occurrence of re bleeding with higher Rockall's Score in group I.

DISCUSSION Peptic ulcer bleeding is the most common cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, responsible for about 50% of all cases. Mortality is increas ing with increasing age and is significantly higher in patients who are already admit-ted in hospital for co-morbidity [3]. Risk factors for peptic ul cer bleeding are non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSA IDs) use and Helicobacter Pylori (HP) infection [8]. In patients with ulcers presenting with ongoing bleed- ing or high risk features (Forrest I, IIA, IIB); surgery was frequently required in the past to solve the situation. However, endoscopic therapy has been well documented to treat these ulcers [11]. The timing of the initial endoscopy has been debated. In general, red hematemesis indicates emergency upper endoscopy while black hematemesis and/or melena without haemodynamic instability can wait until normal working hours. However, from a logistic point of view early endoscopy has been ad vocated to ensure optimal utilization of resources [11] .In this study there was no significant difference in both groups regarding age, shock, presence of co morbid illness or liver cell failure, ulcer size, rockall score and site of ulcer; factors known to affect prognosis in many previous studies. Our study showed that the rate of re bleeding was slightly higher in APC group despite of being statisti-cally insignificant. Also there was no significant relation between the rates of re bleeding and the size of the ulcer. Few reports have concerned the indication for and effi-cacy of each hemostatic ther apy according to location, depth and size of ulcer and bleeding activity of the ex-posed vessel as if the ulcer is large or deep, the possibil-ity of complications including further ulceration, recur-rence of bleeding and perforation is high [12]. A great care is required in performing the procedure if the bleeding ulcer is located on the posterior wall or lesser curvature of the gastri c body or on the posterior wall of the duodenal bulb, the hemostatic rate is lower than for other therapies because of the technical diffi-culty of approaching the lesion [13]. In the present study although there was no statistical significance difference in re bleeding incidence in both groups there was highly significant difference in re bleeding incidence in relation to different Forrest's classes in group I (P < 0.01), while there was insignifi-cant difference in re bleeding incidence in different Forrest's classes in group II. Also, the rate of surgical interference of both groups was 0%. In recent years, the Rockall score has been used to se- lect patients with a low risk of rebleeding for early dis- charge. Almost all patients in this low risk group belong to patients without any stigmata of recent hemorrhage (SRH). However, patients with a SRH are a high-risk group for further re-bleeding and also mortality. It is therefore important to dete rmine whether the Rockall score could be useful in patients who have undergone endoscopic therapy for UGIB to identify high-risk pa- tients and thus improve their management and outcome [14]. In the present study we assessed correlation between high risk Rockall's score (> 5) and occurrence of re bleeding which re bleeding was 6.8 % in low risk Rock- all's score (< 5) while re bleeding was 20% in high risk Rockall's score (> 5). However, this was statistically non significant, but incidence of re bleeding in relation to high risk Rockall's score was significant in group I. This did not go in agreement with others [12], who concluded that the Rockall scoring sy stem accurately identifies patients at high risk of death but not of re bleeding [12]. In spite that our study partially goes with others, who observe good correlation between the Rockall score and both the probability of re bleeding and mortality in pa- tients undergoing endoscopic therapy for peptic ulcer hemorrhage [15,16].

Sung et al. in a meta-analysis of 15 studies reported that regardless of improvements in sustaining hemostasis by clipping leading to less re bleeding and fewer inter-ventions with surgery, mortality has not been reduced and there is no indication of a reduction in the death rate [17]. Nevertheless, it is a my stery that despite successful control of hemorrhage in many studies using various combinations of endoscopic and pharmacological thera- pies the mortality rate remains unchanged. 4. CONCLUSIONS Endoscopic application of hemoclips have a less re bleeding rate than Argon pl asma coagulation for treat- ment of bleeding peptic ulcer, although this was statisti-cally insignificant meanwhile APC is still less cost and easy. Clinical and endoscopic assessment (through Rockall score and Forrest classification) could help in making best choice for endoscopic management. REFERENCES [1] Barkun, A., et al.

ABSTRACT Recent publications have described a relation- ship between fluctuations in environmental physical activity and several aspects of fetal development. This study explored the possible effects of cosmophysical parameters on new- born gender, overall and by maternal age. The gender distribution of 123,368 infants born over a 189-month period (November 1993-July 2009) was analyzed against levels of solar, geomag- netic, and cosmic ray activity at the time of conception. The cohort was then divided into three groups by maternal age (< 28 years, 29-35 years, > 35 years) for further analysis. Pearson correlation coefficients and their probabilities were calculated, and chi-square test was ap-plied, as necessary. The physical data were de-rived from space science centers in the USA, Russia, and Finland. The results showed that the male/female ratio for the whole cohort over the study period was 1.06. However, on monthly analysis, there was a significant male predomi- nance in most months, with a male/female ratio of up to 4. Younger mothers (< 28 years) gave birth to significantly more boys than older mothers. The gender distribution in the three maternal age groups was partially linked to the different physical factors. These findings sug- gest that environmental physical activity in the month of conception may play a role in newborn gender. Further study is needed to determine the mechanism underlying this effect. 1. INTRODUCTION Newborn gender is a focus of human and scientific in- terest. In addition to the known genetic factors that affect fetal development, several studies published in the last decades have considered the potential influence of fluc- tuations in environmental physical activity (solar, geo- magnetic, cosmic ray) on physiologic and pathologic aspects of pregnancy and fetal development [1-9]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible effect of fluctuations in cosmophysical parame-ters at conception on newborn gender distribution, over-all and by maternal age. 2. METHODS The study included all 123,368 infants born at a tertiary university hospital in Israel from November 1993 to July 2009 (189 months): 63,415 male and 59,953 female (liveborn or stillborn). Distribution by maternal age showed that 54,158 (43.86%) infants were born to moth- ers younger than 29 years, 47,655 (38.60%) to mothers aged 29-35 years, and 21,657 (17.54%) to mothers older than 35 years. These data were correlated against levels of the following cosmophysical parameters in the month of conception: solar activity indices \u2014 sunspot number, smoothed sunspot number, solar flux at 2800 MGH and 10.7 cm wavelength, and adjusted solar flux; geomag-netic activity (GMA) indices \u2014Ap, Cp, and Am (plane- tary and regional, for middle latitudes); and cosmic ray activity (CRA) \u2014represented by neutron activity at the Earth's surface (in imp/min). The cosmophysical data for E. Stoupel et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 639-644 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 640 the study period were derived from weekly and monthly calculations published by sp ace science institutions in the United States, Russia, and Finland that regularly monitor these parameters worldwide (National Geo-physical Data Center, Space Weather Prediction Center, Moscow Neutron Monitor, Space Weather Prediction Center; Space Environment Se rvices Center; November 2003-July 2009) [10-15]. 2.1. Statistical Analysis Pearson correlation coeffici ents (r) and their probabili- ties (p) were calculated between newborn gender distri-bution and the physical parameters. Chi-square test was used to analyze the likelihood of a newborn being male or female by physical parameters and maternal age group. Probabilities of 95% and higher were considered significant, probabilities of 90%-94% were considered trends toward significance. Non significant results were marked N.S. 3. RESULTS The male/female ratio in the whole population of new-borns was 1.06. Maximal monthly deviations ranged from 1.387 to 0.7399. One hundred fifty months (79.36%) were characterized by a significant prevalence of male newborns (79.36%), and 39 months (20.1%) by a sig- nificant prevalence of female newborns; in one month, the gender distribution was equal. Table 1 presents the newborn gender relationship with cosmophysical parameters during the month of concep-tion. Table 2 presents the same relationship by maternal age group: 28 years or less; 29 -35 years; and 35 years or more. The results showed that mothers aged 28 years or less gave birth to significantly more male newborns than older mothers ( 2 = 3.9, p = 0.047). The ratio of months with more male newborns to months with more female infants in this maternal age group was 2.62. In the two older groups, this ratio was 2.16 (p < 0.0001). The differences among the maternal age groups prompted our use of multifactorial analysis for each gender and each of the three maternal age groups to pre- dict the chances of a mother of particular age giving birth to a boy or girl according to levels of the cosmo-physical parameters. The findings are shown in Tables 3-5. Factors that failed to show a significant relationship in the total correlation study ( Table 1 ) were included as significant in the subgroup of multifactorial analysis (for example, monthly GMA Cp for mothers older 35 years) (Tables 3-5 ). The relationship of solar and neutron activity was also different among the three age groups, changing from a po- sitive in the young mother group to an inverse relationship Table 1.

DISCUSSION Newborn gender is known to be affected by genetic (chromosome X, Y interaction) and endocrine (hormonal) factors [16,17]. A series of publications has demon-strated that environmental physical parameters, such as solar, cosmic ray and geomagnetic activity, at the begin-ning of pregnancy may also play a role [1-9,17-19], per-haps via their effects on chromosome function (clearly shown in the case of Down syndrome) and hormone secretion [5] Accordingly, other neonatology parameters, including monthly number of infants born, newborn length and weight, preterm deliveries, and occurrence of congenital heart disease and other malformations have been linked to cosmophysical activity [1-6,9,15,17,19, 20] The mechanism underlying this relationship is still unknown, although the physiologic and teratogenic po- tential of cosmophysical factors is clear. The effect of solar activity on human biological behavior is apparently due to solar corpuscular and wave energy. High levels of E. Stoupel et al. / HEALTH 2 (2010) 639-644 Copyright \u00a9 2010 SciRes. Openly accessible at http://www.scirp.org /journal/HEALTH/ 643643 cosmic rays in space leave remains of crushed atoms in the form of neutrons, and the measurement of neutron activity on the Earths' surface serves as an indirect measure of cosmic ray activity. It is assumed that neu-trons, by the nature of their physical properties, connect with H + ions and are converted to protons, which attack cell nuclei in enzymes and other regulatory systems [19,21]. Solar and geomagnetic activities shield the Earth from cosmic rays; when they are weak, the effect of cosmic ray activity increases. One study conducted over a 216-month period found that the correlation be-tween solar and cosmic ray activity was -0.84 (p < 0.0001) [22,23]. Recent study, describing the Y chro-mosome as a very labile structure [24], allows to see it as an object for possible physical influences. According to the world-renowed physicist, Dr. Fein- mann, \"Probably the most powerful single assumption that contributes to the progress of biology is the assump-tion that everything from the animals to the atoms can do that are seen in the biologic al world are the result of the behavior of physical and chemical phenomena\" [25]. Overall, we found that the number of male newborns only slightly surpassed the number of female newborns. A male/female ratio of 1.06 to 1.07 has been consistently reported in studies in various countries and regions [6]. However, males showed a considerable predominance when we compared monthly deliveries: in some months, the male/female ratio was close to 4. This trend was more apparent in younger mothers (age 28 years or less). Further analysis of gender distribution by maternal age showed that in the youngest age group, solar activity had a strong effect and cosmic ray activity a weak effect, whereas in the older groups, this relationship was re-versed. Given that the youngest group was larger, our findings for the overall link of monthly gender distribu-tion with physical factors were close to those for the youngest group. Although we focused only on maternal age in this study, we assume a concomitant younger age of the fa-thers as well, which may also play a role in the physical influences at the time of conception. The presented data constitute another chapter in the study of clinical cosmobiology and the opposing physi-cal forces in our environment (\"equilibrium paradigm\") [26]. The link between the physical environmental and human homeostasis brings to mind the statement of Al-bert Einstein: \"The human will is free only within the bounds of a determined cosmic system\" [27]. 5. CONCLUSIONS Both gender monthly newborn number is linked with the level of cosmophysical activity. Overall, there is a small male prevalence among newborns, although monthly calculation of this relation-ship reveals a considerable male predominance. In addi- tion to other known factors that determine newborn gender, environmental physical activity during the month of conception may also be involved. The relationship of the different physical factors with newborn gender varies by maternal age. More studies are needed to further our understanding of the ways in which physical forces affect newborn gender. REFERENCES [1] Merlob, P., Raisner, S.H., Shimshoni, M. and Stoupel, E.
