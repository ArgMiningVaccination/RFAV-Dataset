The innate immune system represents the first line of defense against these challenges. It is capable of detecting invading microorganisms and tissue damage by conserved, germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and launches a first counterstrike through mechanisms including phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) or anti-microbial peptides. Concomitant production and secretion of cytokines alerts the adaptive immune system and initializes are very potent, highly specific and sustained immune response governed by the activation and expansion of T- and B- cells. Inflammasomes are one important class of cytosolic PRRs as they recognize a large variety of pathogens. Engagement of inflammasome pathways leads to death of the infected host cell by pyroptosis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and IL-18. recently non-canonical inflammasome pathway is triggered by intracellular bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which binds to caspase-11 to activate it. Active caspase-11 triggers pyroptosis and activates and IL-1 secretion. The molecular details of pyroptosis execution and the signaling events downstream of caspase-11 have not been thoroughly characterized, which is why this was the main intere st underlying my PhD work. I investigated the connection between caspase-11 activation and cytokine release triggered by the canonical N LRP3 inflammasome. I could show that caspase-11 stimulates NLRP3 activation by promoting potassium efflux, a well characterized trigger for the NLRP3 inflammasome, in a cell autonomous manner. Subsequently I got interested in the molecular mechanisms underlying pyroptosis induction by Gasdermin- D. We could characterize pore formation by the Gasdermin- D N-terminal fragment as the final step of pyroptosis. Finally, I investigated if cells are capable of preventing or delaying pyroptosis downstream of caspase-11/gasdermin- D. I found that removal of Gasdermin- D pores by ESCRT-III mediated membrane repair represents one mechanism by which cells prevent Gasdermin-D dependent cell death. Overall my results revealed connections between innate immunity signaling pathways, uncovered a novel form of cellular pore forming toxins and demonstrated an unexpected regulation of pyroptosis by cellular survival pathways. 1 Abstract2 Table of contents 1 ABSTRACT ............................................................................................... 1 2 TABLE OF CONTENTS ........................................................................... 2 3 INTRODUCTION ...................................................................................... 4 3.1 Cells of the innate immune system ........................................................................................ 4 3.2 Pattern recognition receptors ................................................................................................ . 5 3.3 PRR signaling from the plasma membrane ............................................................................ 8 3.3. 1 Toll like receptors ............................................................................................................. 8 3.3. 2 Dectins ........................................................................................................................... 10 3.4 Signaling from endosomes .................................................................................................. 10 TLR signaling NOD1/2 signaling .................................................................... 19 3.6. 1 Cytokine maturation and release ...................................................................................... 19 3.6.2 Pyroptosis .......................................................................................................................

They express germline encoded, conserved pattern recognition receptors to orchestrate the initial (<96 hours) inflammatory response to pathogenic or sterile insults. The cells of the innate immune system reside naturally with many tissues like the gut, liver or skin where they react to invading microorganisms or tissue damage. Macrophages develop from precursor cells residing in the bone-marrow. They represent an important first line of defense as they are capable of engulfing and degrading foreign matter and dead host cells without the help of the adaptive immune system. They express a variety of PRRs allowing them to sense pathogen or host derived molecules. Their primary functions are to produce cytokines to recruit other immune cells (Cader & Kaser, 2013; Zigmond & Jung, 2013)and present antigens of engulfed microorganisms to cells of the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the main antigen-presenting-cells (APCs) of the immune system as they are extremely proficient in digesting and presenting microorganisms and proteins. As macrophages, they originate from a common granulocyte macrophage precursor (GMP) from the bone marrow and they are found in various tissues like the skin, the gut or the spleen. Plasmacytoid DCs are circulating in the periphery and are crucial components of the anti- viral response, as they produce large amounts of type-I interferons upon stimulation. DCs get easily stimulated by a variety of signals, as they express different receptors, which leads to secretion of various inflammatory cytokines(Dzopalic et al, 2012; Farache et al, 2013) . Despite their importance for the induction of the adaptive immune response, DCs also function to terminate the immune response, by rendering T-cells inactive or by promoting the development of regulatory T- cells(Farache et al, 2013). Neutrophils have long been neglected as an important part of the innate immune response . They have been considered short lived 'cannon fodder' to initiate the acute phase of inflammation and extracellular pathogens (Borregaard, 2010; Mantovani et al, 2011; Amulic et 2012). They possess a high phagocytic activity, store anti-microbial components in their secretory granules and are important producers of cytokines upon tissue 4 Introductiondamage or microbial invasion(Chen et al, 2014; Jaillon et al). They are capable of fighting several bacteria and viruses by the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Brinkmann & Zychlinsky, 2007) and are important for communication to other cells of the innate immune system like NK cells(Jaeger et al, 2012; Costantini et al, 2011; 2010). Other cells of the innate immune system are innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) , which are made up of ILC1, ILC2 and ILC3 and mast cells . Both cell types are important producers of cytokines in order to communicate to other innate immune cells or the adaptive immune system. Their exact properties and functions are reviewed elsewhere(Hwang & McKenzie, 2013; John & Abraham, 2013). 3.2 Pattern recognition receptors The innate immune system uses germline encoded, conserved receptors to recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or endogenous, danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). The ligands for these pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are usually conserved molecules, essential to the survival of pathogenic microorganisms and are therefore invariable in their molecular composition (Kumar et al , 2011). Most of the receptors can be classified into five families, based on their protein homology domain. These families are the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), (ALRs) ( Table 1)(Kumar et al, 2011) . Family Members Shared domains Localization TLR 1-10 in humans, 1-9 and 11-13 in 1 Overview of PRRs of the innate immune system 5 IntroductionTLRs a nd CLRs are membrane bound receptors and sample the endosomal and the extracellular space for the presence of microbial ligands. NLRs, RLRs and ALRs are cytosolic proteins, which are activated by intracellular pathogens or components thereof. One major consequence of PRR activation is the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons. Beyond these transcriptional responses, PRR also consequences like phagocytosis, death al , 2013; Dixit, 2016). The coordination of all these pathways initiates an innate immune response, which is essential for microbial control and induction of an appropriate adaptive immune response(Palm & Medzhitov, 2009). A common theme that has emerged in the PRR field is the use of adaptor proteins. These proteins are capable of integrating signals, often from multiple types of receptors and couple these receptors to enzymatic effector proteins. Some of the adaptor proteins and their receptors are summarized in Table 2. The role of these adaptors often seems to go beyond a simple coupling-protein function connecting the sensor protein/s to the effector protein/s. Indeed, most of oligomers or filamentous assemblies (ASC speck, Myddosome) which are thought to be necessary for signal amplification (Dick et al, 2016; Lin et al, 2010; Qiao et al, 2013) Adaptor or Adaptor set Receptor interaction Examples for recept ors using adaptor Signaling interaction Localization TIRAP/MyD88 TIR domain TLR2,4,5 Death domain Cell surface, endosomal compartments TRAM/TRIF TIR domain TLR3,4 TRAF binding, RHIM Adaptor proteins of PRRs 6 IntroductionCharles Janeway predicted two key features of innate immunity: 1) The ability to distinguish self from non-self and 2) the ability to activate the innate immune system(Janeway, 1989) . Since his predictions, researcher could show that a variety of microbial molecules are recognized by PRRs and how these pathways lead to the mounting of an effective immune response(Akira & Takeda, 2004; Geijtenbeek & Gringhuis, 2011; Hornung & Latz, 2010). 7 Introduction3.3 PRR signaling from the plasma membrane 3.3.1 Tol l like receptors TLR4 is the best studied member of this family and possesses some unique features that distinguishes it from the other members of the TLR family. TLR4 recognizes a variety of bacterial and endogenous ligands but is best known for its high sensitivity for Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from gram-negative bacteria(Poltorak et al, 1998). Activation of TLR4 by LPS requires a multi-receptor complex composed of LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14 and MD2, which are required to bind LPS and transfer it to TLR4 to induce its dimerization(Schumann et al , 1990; Eckert et al Silva , 2001; Gioannini & Weiss, 2007) . The sequential transfer of LPS from one molecule to another is thought to enable high sensitivity of TLR4 for LPS. It has been estimated that enough LPS monomers can be extracted from one bacterium to activate TLR4 signaling on 1000 macrophages (Gioannini & Weiss, 2007). Upon activation, TLR4 recruits TIRAP ( TIR Domain -Containing Adaptor Protein) and MyD88, which culminates in the activation of NF- kB and AP-1 leading to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1\u00df or TNF a (Figure 3.1 ). TLR4 is also internalized to endosomes, where it recruits different adaptor proteins and engages additional signaling pathways (discussed below). Other TLRs present on the plasma membrane are TLR1, -2, -5 and -6. All these receptors engage MyD88 (Myeloid differentiation primary response 88) dependent NF- kB (nuclear factor 'kappa-light-chain-enhancer' of activate d B-cells) activation. TLR2 mainly acts as heterodimer with other TLRs(Ozinsky et al , 2000). TLR2 forms heterodimers with either TLR -1 or TLR6, and is activated by a variety of lipopeptides and viruses(Buwitt-Beckmann et al , 2010) . Similar to TLR4, these heterocomplexes signal from lipid rafts(Triantafilou et al, 2004) and use co-receptors, for example CD36 (Hoebe et al, 2005) . In a cell type specific manner (Plasmacytoid DCs), TLR2 can lead to interferon (IFN) production upon endocytosis(Barbalat et al, 2009; Dietrich et al, 2010). TLR5 is expressed on neutrophils, monocytes, DCs and epithelial cells(Shibata et al; Gewirtz et al, 2001) and is the receptor for bacterial flagellin(Hayashi et al, 2001; Smith et al, 2003) . TLR5 also activates MyD88 dependent signaling(Hayashi et al, 2001), however it is not clear if TIRAP is required in all cell types(Choi et al, 2012). 8 Introduction Figure 3.1 TLR4 signaling TLR4 signals from the plasma membrane and endosomes. TLR4 requires translocation to lipid rafts enriched with TIRAP for signaling from the plasma membrane. This facilitates interactions with MyD88 upon ligand binding for the formation of the myddosome containing MyD88, TAB2, TAB3, and TAK1. This complex regulates NF- B activation via IKKs. TAK1 release into the cytoplasm also directs MAPK activation. CD14 controls the movement of TLR4 from the plasma membrane into endosomes through the activation of ITAM, Syk, and PLC 2. From endosomes, TLR4 interacts with the sorting adaptor TRAM and the signaling adaptor TRIF to sustain NF- B activation and to induce IRF3-mediated type I IFN production. IRF3 activation controls type I IFN production and requires TRAF3 recruitment to TRIF. TRAF3 then interacts with TANK (or TANK-related proteins) to recruit IKK , IKK , and TBK1, which activate IRF3. (Solid lines indicate signal transduction; dotted lines indicate trafficking events.) (Abbreviations: al, 2015). 9 Introduction3.3.2 Dectins CLRs are a heterogeneous group of hundreds of receptors, which share a characteristic C- type lectin-like domain (CTLD). The CTLD was identified as a double-loop domain capable of binding calcium and carbohydrates but up to today, CLRs have been shown to bind a variety of different ligands. Dectin-1 and -2 are the best studied members of this class of receptors, which is further divided into 17 sub- families (Brubaker et al, 2015). Most dectins act as opsonins, however for example Dectin-1 is capable of activating NF-kB upon recognition of fungal beta-1,3-glucans, which promotes phagocytosis and downstream signaling. Dectin-1 activates Syk kinases(Fuller et al, 2007), which are responsible for NF- kB activation and in turn are also capable of activating PLC(phospholipase- c) 2, which promotes additional NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T- cells) activation (Tassi et al, 2009) . Dectin -1 has been shown to be essential for anti-fungal-defense in both mice and humans(Brown et al, 2003; Ferwerda et al, 2009). 3.4 Signaling from endosomes 3.4.1 TLR signaling from endosomes As mentioned above, TLR4 undergoes endocytosis but interestingly, signaling is not terminated at this point, like for many other receptors e.g. GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors). TLR4 continues to signal from endosomes inducing a late wave of NF- kB activation and, importantly, type I IFN production. Both pathways are dependent on the adaptors TRAM (TIR Domain-Containing Adaptor Protein) and TRIF( TIR-domain- interferon- )(Yamamoto et al , 2003a; 2003b). TRAM moves independently of CD14 from the plasma membrane to endosomes and it is thought that TRAM displaces TIRAP from TLR4, leading to engagement of dependent signaling pathways(Kagan et al , 2008; Enokizono et al, 2013; Piao et al , 2013). TRIF is capable of recruiting TRAF3 to induce TBK1 and subsequent IRF3 activation, leading to type I IFN production ( Figure 3.1 )(H\u00e4cker et al , . How TRIF controls late NF- kB activation is not entirely clear, though it seems to be dependent on RIPK1, TRADD and caspase-8(Weng et al , 2014; Brubaker 2015). 10 IntroductionOther TLRs that signal from endosomes recognize different varieties of nucleic acids and induce type I IFNs, partially in a cell type specific manner. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA molecules and induces type I IFN production through, TRIF, but independently of TRAM, as the TIR domain of TLR3 is capable of directly binding TRIF(Brown et al, 2006; Ulrichts & Tavernier, 2008). In pDCs, TLR7/9 are capable of inducing type I IFN production through a MyD88/IRF7 dependent signaling axis, however which other factors are required for this process is not entirely clear(Honda et al, 2005). 3.4.2 NOD1/2 signaling from endosomes With their N-terminal CARD (Caspase activation and recruitment domain), their central NACHT and their C-terminal LRR (Leucine rich repea t) domain, NOD1/2 are prototypical members of the NLR (Nod like receptor) family (Saleh, 2011). They recognize components of the bacterial outer membranes or cell wall like D-glutamyl- meso -diaminopimelic 2003b; Chamaillard al, 2003) . Upon activation, they associate with RIPK2 to induce MAPK and NF-kB activation(Park et al, 2007). Although synthesized in the cytosol, NOD1 and NOD2 have been observed to localize to endosomes(Barnich et al , 2005; Irving et al , 2014; Nakamura et al , 2014; Travassos et al, 2010). Interestingly a Crohn\u00b4s disease associated NOD2 mutant, which is not activated by MDP, also shows aberrant subcellular localization(Barnich et al , 2005) . Independent of NF-kB activation, NODs can induce autophagy to eliminate bacterial pathogens(Travassos et al , 2010). This function is also impaired in cells expressing the Crohn\u00b4s disease -associated NOD2 variant. 3.5 PRR signaling in (RIG -I), melanoma differentiation gene 5 (MDA5) and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2), make up the RLR family. All of these proteins detect the presence of RNA in the cytosol(Yoneyama et al, 2005; 2004) and although they are generally depicted as cytosolic proteins, they might localize to specific locations, where viral entry or replication takes place. To distinguish self from viral RNA, RLRs detect motifs and features, specific to viral genomes or replication 11 Introductionintermediates like 5' triphosphate RNA, long dsRNA and specific sequences such as the poly-U region of the hepatitis C virus RNA(Hornung et al, 2006; Pichlmair et al, 2009; al, Gehrke, MDA5 and RIG-I bind to MAVS (mitochondrial anti-viral signaling protein) via CARD-CARD interaction for further downstream signaling(Seth et al , Similar to RIG-I undergoes limiting membranes of mitochondria, peroxisomes and the mitochondr ial outer membrane where MAVS are localized(Seth , 2005; Dixit et 2010; Horner et al, 2011). Upon activation, MAVS undergo CARD mediated self-polymerization, which leads to recruitment of the ubiquitin ligases TRAF-2,-5 and-6, which are required for activation of TBK1 (Tank binding kinase 1) and the IKK (inhibitor of B kinase) complex(Liu et al, 2013). These kinases promote the activation of NF-kB, IRF3 and IRF7, which ultimately leads to production interferon stimulated gens Interestingly, the ability of MAVS to initiate IFN signaling is strictly dependent on its C-terminal transmembrane domain, which shows that interaction with RLRs is not sufficient to trigger downstream signaling, but that MAVS activation is regulated by receptor recruitment and proper membrane localization(Seth et al, 2005; Dixit et al, 2010) . 3.5.2 Cytosolic DNA sensing: The cGAS/STING signaling axis The stimulator of IFN genes (STING) hast been known to be involved in cytosolic DNA sensing and promotion of downstream signaling(Ishikawa & Barber, 2008; Zhong et al , 2008; Sun et al, 2009). STING has been proposed to act both, as an adaptor and receptor in different scenarios. During viral infections it has been proposed to act as an adaptor for potential DNA sensors like IFI16 and DDX41, although the exact mechanisms were unclear(Unterholzner et al , 2010; Zhang et al , 2011). Induction of IFN responses upon infection with cytosolic bacteria by STING could be well explained, as STING is activated by cyclic di-nucleotides (CDNs), which are second-messengers frequently produced in and even secreted from bacteria(Burdette et al, 2011; Yin et al, 2012; Ouyang et al, 2012; Huang et al, 2012; Shang et al, 2012; Shu et al, 2012). Although CDNs synthesis has been thought be a unique feature of bacteria, the mammalian CDNs synthase cGAS (cyclic di- al , 2013; Sun et al , 2013). binding IntroductionDNA stretches, cyclic-di- GMP -AMP (cGAMP) from ATP and GTP, which acts as a second messenger, binds and activates STING. STING is a localized at the ER during steady state and undergoes trafficking to poorly defined vesicles or puncta at the Figure 3.2 Nucleic acid sensing in the cytosol The RLRs detect pathogen-derived RNA within the cytosol to induce the production of IFN and pro-inflammatory cytokines. The TBK1, IKK, and MAVS pathways lead to activation of the transcription factors for the induction of IFN and other cytokine genes. MAVS activity is regulated by polymerization and signaling from mitochondria results in production of type I and III IFN, whereas peroxisomal signaling induces the production only of type III IFN. (b) cGAS detects pathogen-derived DNA from within the cytosol and nucleus to induce the production of IFN. In the presence of DNA, the enzyme cGAS converts ATP and GTP to the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP. Production of cGAMP induces the activation of STING. TBK1 is recruited to this site of signaling to induce the production of type I IFN. (Solid lines indicate signal transduction; dotted lines 13 IntroductionGOLGI apparatus(Ishikawa & Barber, 2008; Saitoh et al, 2009). This relocation is dependent on ATG9a and VPS34, leads to activation of TBK1 and IRF3 and subsequent IFN production(Saitoh et al, 2009; Konno et al, 2013)( Figure 3 .2b). The cGAS/STING signaling axis seems to be the sensor in most scenarios, ranging from recognition of nuclear self- DNA, infection with DNA viruses, cytosolic bacteria or engulfment of dead cells (reviewed in (Chen et al, 2016a) ). 3.5.3 Canonical inflammasomes In 2002, Tschopp and co-workers described a high molecular weight complex that is formed in the cytosol of stimulated immune cells and that mediates the activation of inflammatory caspases, hence termed an inflammasome (Martinon et al , 2002). Since then, the field has expanded rapidly and our understanding of activation and regulation of inflammasome signaling has increased tremendously. Canonical inflammasomes consist of a PRR, which recognizes microbial molecules (Moltke et al, 2013) or other signals altering the homeostasis of the cytosol(Liston & Masters, 2017). Upon activation, the receptors oligomerize and recruit the adaptor protein ASC (Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD , also called PYCARD, because it has a Pyrin domain (PYD) and a Caspase recruitment domain (CARD)), which forms a large oligomeric structure, referred to as the 'ASC Speck' (Broz et al, 2010; Guey et al, 2014). ASC is required to bridge the receptor to pro-caspase- 1 and the formation of the ASC speck is an efficient mechanism for signal amplification to enhance caspase-1 activation(Dick et al , 2016). Recruitment of pro- caspase-1 leads to proximity induced autoproteolytic cleavage and activation of the caspase. Caspase-1, cysteine-specific aspartate directed protease, then induces two main signaling pathways: 1) the proteolytic maturation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1 and IL-18 and 2) the cleavage and activation of gasdermin-D(Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015a) , which is capable for permeabilizing cellular membranes through the formation of pores(Liu et al , 2016b; Ding et al , 2016) leading to a pro-inflammatory, lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis (Fink & Cookson, 2005) . To date, five different receptors which form inflammasomes have been identified. The nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing NLRP3 pyrin (reviewed in(Broz & Dixit, 2016) ). The molecular activation mechanisms 14 Introductionof these inflammasomes are fairly well understood and the mechanisms underlying NLRP3, NLRC4 and AIM2 activation, which are relevant to my work, are discussed below. 3.5.3.1 NLRP3 The NLRP3 inflammasome (also known as cryopyrin), responds to a variety of different stimuli, among them crystalline substances like monosodium urate (MSU), bacterial pore forming toxins (nigericin, gramicidin), a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens (Latz et al , 2013). Given the diversity of these stimuli, it is likely that all these stimuli converge on one common cellular event, to trigger NLRP3 activation. To date, several possible triggers, including mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) (Gro\u00df et al, release(Shimada et al, 2012) , lysosomal rupture(Hornung et al, 2008) and others have been implicated. It has been convincingly shown by several groups, that potassium efflux from the cytosol is one common event for a large variety of stimuli(R\u00fchl & Broz, 2015; Mu\u00f1oz-Planillo et al, 2013; Gross et al, 2012). The hypothesis, that potassium efflux is one important step during NLRP3 activation is underpinned by the fact, that low potassium medium is capable of activating NLRP3 independently of sodium and calcium influx(Mu\u00f1oz-Planillo et al , 2013) and this activation is not blocked by mitochondrial ROS scavengers (S.R. and P.B. unpublished observations). Recently an additional regulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, the NIMA related 2016). NEK7 directly interacts with NLRP3, in manner dependent on potassium efflux to induce its oligomerization. Interestingly the catalytic domain of NEK7, but not the catalytic activity is required for NLRP3 activation ( Figure 3.3c (He et al, 2016) . While other inflammasomes are mainly involved in host defense against pathogens, several NLRP3 gain-of-function mutations(Meng et al , 2009; Brydges et al , 2009) have been identified, which lead to auto-inflammatory diseases referred to as Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CA PS). The disease pathology is mainly caused by massive, periodic IL-1 production, as treatment with an IL-1R antagonist provides significant improvement in mice carrying these mutations(Meng et al, 2009). 3.5.3.2 NAIP -NLRC4 NLRC4 was initially identified due to its homology to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1). It was shown, that bacterial flagellin(Mariathasan et al , 2004; Miao et al , 2006; 15 IntroductionFranchi et al, 2006) and components of the bacterial Type-3 secretion system (T3SS)(Zhao et al, 2011; Miao et al, 2010) activate the NLRC4 inflammasome. Interestingly, NLRC4 is not the receptor for these ligands but it uses the NLR family, apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) as receptors. In murine cells, binding of their cognate ligands by NAIP proteins - the T3SS rod is bound by NAIP2, the T3SS needle by NAIP1 and flagellin by NAIP5 and NAIP6 - allows a conformational change and binding to NLRC4(Zhao et al, 2011; Kofoed & Vance, 2011). It was always thought that ligand binding happens via the LRR of NLRC4, but instead NAIPs bind NLRC4 via the NOD domain( Figure 3.3b )(Tenthorey et al, 2014). Human cells only have one NAIP gene, but it was shown recently, that an extended isoform NAIP* is expressed in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, which confers responsiveness to Salmonella flagellin(Kortmann et al, 2015). 3.5.3.3 AIM2 The observation that microbial and host derived cytosolic DNA induces caspase-1 activation, dependent on ASC, but independent of NLRP3, TLRs or interferons, prompted the hypothesis that there must be a dedicated cytosolic DNA receptor leading to inflammasome formation(Muruve et al , 2008). Several groups showed that the absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), a member of the PYHIN (Pyrin and HIN domain-containing) family is the responsible sensor(Hornung et al, 2009; Fernandes-Alnemri et al, 2009; Roberts et al, 2009) . The N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) is responsible for recruitment of ASC upon activation by DNA stretches, which bind to the C-terminal HIN-200 domain. AIM2 binds DNA via the sugar-phosphate backbone, therefore there exists no sequence specificity towards any kind of DNA (Hornung et al, 2009; Jin et al, 2012). Generation of Aim2 / deficient mice confirmed the importance of the AIM2 inflammasome in host defense against DNA viruses and, surprisingly, against bacterial pathogens like Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida et al , 2010). AIM2 has been implicated in a variety of human diseases among then systemic lupus erythematosus(Dihlmann et al, 2014a; Dombrowski et al, 2011; Dihlmann et al, 2014b), Psoriasis(Dombrowski et al, 2011) and the development of colorectal cancer(Ponomareva et al , 2013; Wilson et al , 2015; Man et al , 2015). Interestingly, a recent study showed that pharmacological disruption of the nuclear envelope leads to AIM2 dependent inflammasome activation, providing strong evidence that in a variety of scenarios, leakage of self-DNA from the nucleus can have detrimental consequences(Di Micco et al, 2016). 16 recently a been discovered(Kayagaki et al, 2011). Kayagaki et al . found that murine BMDMs infected with gram-negative bacteria die by pyroptosis, which is dependent on the presence and catalytic activity of caspase-11 and independent of caspase-1(Kayagaki et al , 2011). They could show that the Casp1-deficient mice, which were widely used at the time, are actually Casp1/Casp11 double deficient mice, due to a passenger mutation originating from 129S mice, which only express a truncated and non-functional version of caspase-11(Kayagaki et al, 2011). Importantly, caspase-11 is the central mediator of septic shock during injection of bacterial Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model of endotoxemia. Subsequently it was shown that bacterial LPS is the ligand for caspase-11, leading to its activation(Kayagaki et al , 2013; Hagar et al, 2013). Another study showed surprisingly that this activation happens via direct binding of LPS to the CARD domain of caspase-11 (-4/-5 in humans), therefore establishing the model, that caspase-11 is at the same time the receptor and the effector caspase of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway(Shi et al, 2014). Caspase-11 is not capable of cleaving IL-1 but instead induces potassium efflux to activate NLRP3 in a cell autonomous manner to cytokine secretion( Figure 3.3d Burgk et al, 2015b). Recently, it was proposed that beyond recognition of LPS through its CARD domain, caspase-11 binds endogenous oxidized lipids via its catalytic domain and triggers activation of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Interestingly this kind of activation only triggers IL-1 maturation but not cell death in dendritic cells and induces a state of so- called 'DC hyperactivation'. The authors show that the K d for oxPAPC, the mixture of oxidizes phospholipids that binds to the catalytic domain of caspase-11, is 100 fold lower than the K d for LPS, which could explain, why this low level activation only triggers Nlrp3 mediated cytokine secretion, without killing dendritic cells(Zanoni et al , 2016). A follow up study identified internalization by CD14 mediated endocytosis as a critical step for immune cell hyperactivation and two specific phospholipids (PGPC, POVPC) as stimulators of hyperactivation in BMDMs(Zanoni et al, 2017). It remains to be determined, if other lipid species are capable of activating caspase-11, which could establish a broader role for caspase-11 in sensing of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators. 17 Introduction Figure 3.3 Canonical inflammasomes a The AIM2 inflammasome detects the presence of endogenous or exogenous cytosolic DNA via its HIN200 domain. Binding of DNA leads to a conformational change and binding of ASC via the pyrin domain, which recruits pro- caspase-1. b The NAIP-NLRC4 inflammasome recognizes components of the T3SS and flagellin of gram-negative bacteria. Also extracellular bacteria can activate this inflammasome as the T3SS accidentally co-translocates flagellin molecules upon injection of effectors into the host cytosol or parts of the needles disintegrate after injection at the cytosolic side of the PM. NAIPs bind the bacterial proteins to activate NLRC4, which in turn exposes its CARD domain. Exposure of the CARD domains leads either to direct recruitment of pro-caspase-1('death complex') and activation, resulting in cell death with little cytokine maturation or in recruitment of ASC through CARD -CARD interaction, which in turn recruits more ASC and pro-caspase-1 which results in strong caspase-1 activation, cell death and more IL-1 maturation. c Formation of pores in the PM through channel opening (e.g. by extracellular ATP stimulation) or pore forming toxins (e.g. nigericin) leads to potassium efflux, which is required for most NLRP3 stimuli. For some stimuli, mitochondrial dysfunction and generation of mtROS might be required downstream of potassium efflux. Activation of NLRP3 requires recruitment of NEK7 to induce oligomerization and subsequent recruitment of ASC and pro-caspase-1. d Cytosolic LPS, ei ther delivered artificially or during gram-negative bacterial infection is recognized by the CARD of caspase-1, which upon binding to LPS, oligomerizes and gets activated. To date it is not clear, if autoproteolytic cleavage is required or sufficient for caspase-11 activation. Active caspase-11 is induces potassium efflux in a cell autonomous manner to induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation. 18 Introduction3.6 Effector functions of inflammasome activation 3.6.1 Cytokine maturation and release Caspase-1 was initially described as ICE (Interleukin converting enzyme)(Dandekar & Argos, 2008), as it processes IL -1 and IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms. Expression of IL-1 and the closely related IL-1 are induced through TLR stimulation, whereas IL-18 is expressed constitutively(Gross et al, 2012). As discussed, IL-1 and IL-18 require processing by caspase-1 to be active, whereas IL-1 can be processed by caspase-1 but is active without processing and is released as an active cytokine also during caspase-1-independent lysis e.g. necroptosis(Wallach et al or caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis(Kayagaki et al , 2011) . Besides release of mature cytokines by lysis, several other mechanisms for 'unconventional secretion' have been implicated (discussed below), however recent studies unraveled tha t at least in BMDMs, pyroptosis constitutes the main release mechanism for mature cytokines after caspase-1 activation ( Figure 3.4 (Shi et al, 2015a). 3.6.2 Pyroptosis Pyroptosis was first described by Fink and Cookson as a lytic, non-apoptotic caspase- 1 driven cell death, characterized by cell swelling (probably due to membrane pore formation) and the subsequent lysis of the cells (Fink & Cookson, 2005). The name originates from the Greek 'pyro' (fire or fever) and 'ptosis' (to fall) indicating the pro-inflammatory nature of this cell death(Fink & Cookson, 2005). After years of research, two seminal studies in 2015 demonstrated that one substrate, gasdermin-D, of both, caspase-1 and caspase-11 is essential for induction of pyroptosis. Generation of Gsdmd-deficient cells and mice showed that gasdermin-D is essential for pyroptosis and activation of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway during LPS transfection and LPS induced septic shock in mice ( Figure 3.4 (Shi et al, 2015a; Kayagaki et al, 2015)). Caspase-1 driven pyroptosis depends only at early time points on gasdermin-D but prolonged caspase-1 activation results in gasdermin-D independent pyroptosis, probably due to activation of caspase-8 in response to ASC speck formation (Sagulenko et al, 2013) or cleavage of cellular substrates by caspase-1 (Kayagaki et al, 2015; Heilig et al, 2017). 19 Introduction Figure 3.4 Effector functions of inflammasome activation Active caspase-1 and caspase-11 both cleave gasdermin-D into a soluble C-terminal fragment (CT) and a cytotoxic, pore forming N-terminal fragment to permeabilizes them. Caspase-1 cleaves pro- IL-1 into its mature form, which is released partially through gasdermin-D pores. Pore formation leads to water influx, swelling of cells and subsequent lysis accompanied by release of cytosolic content. 20 Introduction3.7 Gasdermin family of proteins The gasdermin family of proteins is conserved in vertebrates and composed of four paralogues in humans (GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC and GSDMD). Mice homologues and three Gsdma homologues. Members of the gasdermin family share a distinct N-terminal and a C-terminal region connected by a linker region. This feature is shared by the Dfna5 and the Dfnb59 genes, which can be considered to be extended family members. The N-termini of all members (except Dfnb59) display similar cytotoxic properties to the gasdermin- D N-terminal fragment. 3.7.1 Gasdermin-D Gasdermin-D is the best studied family member, as its role in pyroptosis induction downstream of inflammatory caspase activation has been investigated thoroughly. As discussed above, gasdermin-D is a substrate of both caspase-1 and caspase-11 and cleavage of gasdermin-D by essential for pyroptosis induction (Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015a). The N-terminal fragment is the active part of gasdermin- D, as its expression leads to pyroptotic morphology and cell death, whereas the C-terminal fragment does not kill cells upon expression. We and several other groups could show that the GSDMD Nterm translocates to cellular membranes upon cleavage by inflammatory caspases, where it forms pores and permeabilizes membranes (Liu et al, 2016; Sborgi et al, al , et al , 2016b; Ding et al , 2016). Formation of these pores leads to breakdown of the electrochemical gradient across the PM and water influx due to osmotic pressure. The combination of these events ultimately leads to swelling, rupture and lysis of the cell. It is thought, that the C-terminal fragment acts a solubilization factor or 'chaperone' for the N-terminal fragment, to prevent cytotoxicity prior to cleavage. This hypothesis is supported by the observation, that the cytotoxic activity of the gasdermin- A N-terminus can be inhibited by expressing the C-terminal fragment independently(Ding et al , 2016; Shi 2015a) . Therefore, pore by gasdermin-D represents the dominant 5 (DFNA5), originates from the discovery of the gene, as mutations in the Dfna5 gene cause heritable, nonsyndromal deafness, characterized by gradual hearing loss, typically starting at high frequency at the age of 15(Bischoff et al, 2004; van Laer et al , 1998). analysis shows, that DFNA5 has putative caspase- 3 cleavage site within the region, connecting the N-terminal and the C-terminal region. It was shown that DFNA5 expressing cells undergoing apoptosis, and therefore caspase- 3 activation, rather dye by a necrotic cell death, characterized by cell swelling, rupture and lysis, rather than condensation and formation of apoptotic bodies. These findings implicate DFNA5 to operate as critical switch between apoptosis and secondary necrosis(Rogers et al, 2017). A second study could confirm these results, however the authors also went on to show, that DFNA5 (or gasdermin-E as they call it) is suppressed in many cancer cells and that enforced expression of DFNA5 enhances lytic cell death of cancer cells upon chemotherapy drug exposure. Furthermore, chemotherapy induced toxicity and inflammation was ablated in DFNA5 deficient animals(Wang et al , the GSDMD permeabilizes membranes through the formation of pores after cleavage and separation from the C-terminus, explaining the mechanism how DFNA5 promotes necrotic cell death after caspase-3 activation. Further research needs to determine the physiological role of DFNA5 during apoptosis and its expression and function in specific tissues. 3.7.3 Other gasdermin family members Multiple spontaneous mutations in gasdermin-A3 have been identified to lead to hyperkeratosis and spontaneous alopecia(Runkel et al, 2004; Lunny et al, 2005; Tanaka et al, 2007; Li et al, 2010; Zhou et al, 2012). The disease-causing mutations have been shown to disrupt the interaction between the cytotoxic N-terminal domain and the C-terminal part of the protein, leading to pore formation and cytotoxicity without cleavage of the linker region (10). This explains the inflammation as a depletion of skin bulge stem cells observed in mice with Gsdma3 mutations(Zhou et al, 2012; Shi et al, 2015b). SNPs in both, human Gsdma and Gsdmb, are associated with asthma in multiple populations(Yu et al, 2011; Wu et al, 2009b; Moffatt et , 2007; . gasdermin-B can be cleaved by apoptotic caspases, and thus might lead to inactivation of the protein during apoptosis(Chao 22 Introductionet al , 2017), however if there is any biological relevance to this observation remains to be determined. Gasdermin-C is expressed in esophagus, stomach, trachea, spleen intestines, bladder in skin {Saeki:ollkdwRF} (Wu et al, 2009a). It has not yet been implicated in any diseases in mice or humans. DFNB59 is as DFNA5 associated with hearing loss(Delmaghani et al, 2006; Schwander et al, 2007). It was shown to be essential for proliferation of peroxisomes(Delmaghani et al, 2015) , but if DFNB59 has a transport function, or also forms pores in peroxisomes needs to be determined. 23 Introduction3.8 Other modes of regulated cell death 3.8.1 Apoptosis ( Figure 3.5 ) Apoptotic cell death is either initiated via ligation of death receptors or by engagement of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Activation of either pathway culminates in the activation of executor caspases, namely caspase-3, -6 and -7. These executor are synthesized as inactive precursors and lack protein-protein interaction domains as their activation is achieved through inter-domain cleavage by the initiator caspases-8/-9(Salvesen & Riedl, 2008). These executioner caspases (especially -3 and -7) are capable of cleaving more than 1000 substrates(Crawford & Wells, 2011). Cleavage of these substrates activates or represses certain cellular signaling pathways leading to the characteristic changes associated with apoptosis. These include chromatin condensation (pyknosis), rounding of cells and membrane blebbing (Ricci et al, 2004),(Sakahira et al, 1998). The initiator caspases -8 and - 9 are also synthesized as inactive monomers, however they possess additional protein-protein interaction domains and get activated through proximity-induced auto-proteolytic cleavage(Pop et al, 2007),(Oberst et al, 2010). Which of the initiator caspases is activated in response to a certain stimulus is determined by the different pathways of apoptosis, which can be engaged. The mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis (intrinsic pathway) is the most common mechanism of apoptosis in vertebrates. Stimuli, which feed into this pathway include DNA damage, growth factor deprivation, ER stress and developmental cues (Bratton & Salvesen, 2010) . The B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) family of proteins is responsible for integration of these stimuli as these proteins regulate the critical step of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), which allows subsequent activation of caspase-9 by the apoptosome(Chipuk et al , 2010). The Bcl-2 protein family consists of three broad classes: pro-apoptotic effector Mcl1) which block apoptosis and BH3-only proteins (e.g. Bid, Bim, Bad and Noxa) which repress anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members. Bax and Bak are in the found in the cytosol in healthy cells, however upon activation, or more precisely loss of inhibition by one of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family members(O'Neill et al, 2016), they are capable of permeablizing the mitochondrial outer membrane through the formation of large oligomeric pores (Eskes et al, 2000),(Dewson et al, 2009),(Korsmeyer et al, 2000). 24 IntroductionThis process referred to as MOMP, release cytochrome c as well as the secondary mitochondria derived activator of caspases (SMAC) and Omi from the mitochondrial intermembrane space. Cytochrome c release is the essential step for the intrinsic apoptotic pathway to proceed as, once in the cytosol, it binds to Apaf1 and induces its oligomerization(Zou et al , 1997). This allows the formation of an active apoptosome, providing an activation platform for caspase-9, which is recruited via its CARD domain and gets autoproteolytically activated(Yu et al , 2005),(Yuan et al , 2010). As discussed above, activation of caspase-9 leads to processing of executioner caspases, allowing apoptosis to proceed. The apoptotic response is potentiated by Smac and Omi which are released from the mitochondria during MOMP, as they antagonize the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP). In the absence of Smac and Omi XIAP inhibits the catalytic activity of the caspases -3, -7 and -9 and mediates ubiquitination of active (Eckelman et al, 2006). The extrinsic pathway of apoptosis in turn is initiated by death receptor signaling. Death receptors are a subset of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TFNR) family, including TNFR1, Fas and TRAIL R1/2 (Dickens et al , 2012) . They recruit caspase-8 and other signaling molecules important for inflammation and cell adhesion by homotypic protein-protein interactions mediated by their death domain/s(Newton & Dixit, 2012). Upon activation of TRAIL -R or FAS by their ligands, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) is recruited, which through exposure of its death effector domain (DED) brings caspase- 8 molecules into close proximity triggering their protease activity. Auto-proteolytic activation of caspase-8 promotes apoptosis in some cells (type I cells) by cleaving and activating caspase-3 and -7 however in many cell types (type II cells) the executioner caspases are inhibited by XIAPs, which blocks apoptosis(Jost et al, 2009). In these cells cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 is required to induce MOMP and therefore release SMAC and Omi, which neutralize XIAPs and allows apoptosis to proceed (Dickens et al, 2012) . 25 Introduction Figure 3.5 Apoptosis The extrinsic pathway is initiated by ligation of death receptors and leads to activation of caspase- 8 and -10, which in turn activate the executioner caspases 3&7. Caspase -8 and-10 can cleave BID into tBID to engage the intrinsic pathway as well. The interactions between Bcl-2 family members regulate the critical step of MOMP, which decides if a cell undergoes apoptosis or not. Once MOMP is initiated, release of SMAC and cytochrome c lead to inhibition of XIAPs and apoptosome assembly respectively. Caspase-9, which is activated within the apoptosome, cleaves caspase-3 and -7 to execute 2017) 26 Introduction3.8.2 Necroptosis ( Figure 3.6 ) Signaling downstream of TFNR1 is more complex and can lead to apoptosis, survival or necroptosis. TNFR1 recruits Tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein (TRADD) and other factors to activate NF-kB, which rather culminates in an inflammatory response rather than cell death (Newton & Dixit, 2012). One consequence of NF-kB activation is the production of cellular FLICE (FADD-like IL-1 -converting enzyme)-inhibitory protein (c- FLIP) (Micheau , 2001). Though TNFR1 engagement leads to caspase-8 activation, by recruitment TRADD, FADD and Receptor interacting kinase (RIPK) 1 (also referred to as complex II) (Declercq et al, 2009),(Christofferson & Yuan, 2010), expression of cFLIP proteins through NF-kB activation however inhibits caspase-8 mediated apoptosis in most cells. Although in complex with cFLIP caspase-8 is catalytically active and apoptosis is not induced. It remains obscure why this is the case, although a hypothesis is, that this complex is prone to more rapid degradation (Geserick et al , 2009) .Therefore TNFR1 engagement leads to inflammation and cell survival rather than apoptosis in most cells. As discussed above, complex II formation in presence of cFLIP proteins does not promote apoptosis in response to TNFR1 ligation. Complex II formation leads, beside recruitment of RIPK1, to the recruitment of RIPK3, a crucial step for necroptotic cell death to proceed. Necroptosis is characterized by a loss of membrane integrity, dissipation of the electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane and release of cytosolic content from the cell(Cho et al, 2009), (He et al, 2009),(Zhang et al, 2009). RIPK3 is recruited by RIPK1 through interaction of their RIP homology interaction motifs (RHIM) domains. In this configuration complex II is referred to as the RIPoptosome, and rather induces necrosis than apoptosis(Feoktistova et al , 2011),(Tenev et al , 2011) . A series of post-translational modifications is required for assembly of this signalling platform. De-ubiquitination of RIPK1 promotes assembly of the RIPoptosome(Wang et al , 2008),(O'Donnell et al , 2011),(Moulin et al, 2012) . Moreover, the kinase activity of RIPK1 is required for activation of RIPK3(Cho et al, 2009), (He et al, 2009),(Zhang et al, 2009). In addition, the caspase-8- cFLIP heterodimer necroptosis) are cleavage substrates for caspase-8(Pop et al , 2011). Consequently, necroptosis response to TNFR1 ligation only progresses if FLIP- caspase -8 activity is blocked. RIP dependent necroptosis can also be triggered downstream of TLR3 or TLR4 as these receptors signal through TIR-domain-containing RHIM-containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (TRIF)(Imtiyaz et al al, 2011) . TRIF recruits RIPK1 and RIPK3 to induce RIP dependent necroptosis(Feoktistova et al, 2011). Also, viral infections can induce necroptosis. The RHIM containing cytosolic DNA sensor DAI recruits RIP3 through its RHIM domains if activated by viral dsDNA(Upton et al, 2010),(Upton et al, 2012),(Cho et al, 2009) . Upon activation by one of the mechanisms described above, RIPK3 phosphorylates the mixed lineage kinase- domain like pseudokinase (MLKL)(Quarato et al , 2016), leading to translocation to the plasma membrane (Cai et al , 2014),loss of PM asymmetry, collapse of the ionic gradient across the PM and ultimately lysis of the cell(Chen et al, 2016b). It has been proposed that calcium influx mediated by MLKL through interaction with the non-voltage gated ion channel TRPM7 is critical for necroptosis, however depending on the cell type, it seems that although calcium influx is reduced, cell death is only modestly impacted (Cai et al, 2014) . This discrepancy might be explained by the model, that MLKL itself is capable of forming pores in membranes (Wang et al, 2014). It remains to be investigated, if both mechanisms occur simultaneously or are in any way dependent on each other. 28 Introduction Figure 3.6 Necroptosis Engagement of TNFR leads to complex I assembly and to RIPK1 dependent NF-kB activation and gene expression, if RIPK1 is ubiquitinated by cIAP1/2. CYLD leads to de-ubiquitination of RIPK1, enabling its interaction with RIPK3 and caspase-8 leading to formation of the Ripoptosome or the Necrosome. In the presence of c-FLIP proteins, Ripoptsome mediated apoptosis is inhibited, as capase-8 is inhibited by cFLIPL L. However, the caspase-8 cFLIP complex is capable of cleaving CYLD as well as RIPK1 and RIPK3, therefore inhibiting MLKL activation and necroptosis. Therefore, necroptosis only occurs if caspase-8 is inhibited. (adapted from Tummers and Green, 2017) 29 Introduction3.9 Plasma membrane repair mechanisms (Figure 3.7 ) It has been known for several decades that cells can repair damage inflicted to their plasma membrane (PM) by mechanisms strictly dependent on extracellular calcium ions(Andrews et al, 2014). Early experiments observed large patches of membranes and vesicles(Miyake & McNeil, 1995; Bi et al , 1995), which were recruited to the site of injury, leading to the hypothesis that intracellular pieces of membranes fuse at the site of injury to repair the PM(McNeil et al, 2000). Yet, how these fusion events occur biophysically and how this leads to restoration of PM integrity couldn\u00b4t be explained. More recently two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms have been investigated to the molecular detail. These mechanisms, endocytosis of PM pores and shedding of damaged pieces of membrane, both are dependent on calcium influx and are even capable of explaining the repair and removal of stable transmembrane pores. 3.9.1 ASM mediated endocytosis of PM pores The observation that wounding of the PM leads to massive exocytosis (Miyake & McNeil, 1995; Bi et al, 1995), was initially surprising but could be confirmed in multiple cell types in response to different kinds of membrane damage(Forestier et al, 2011; Roy et al, 2004) . It was initially thought that the membrane patches appearing at the site of injury would serve either to 'clog' the hole in the PM (McNeil et al, 2000)or they would serve to reduce the membrane tension around the site of injury(Togo et al, 2000), which was supported by the findings, that lysosomal markers could be observed in punctate patterns at the PM upon injury(Reddy et al, 2001). The realization that stable transmembrane pores, like the bacterial toxin Streptolysin O (SLO) were removed in a calcium dependent manner prompted a closer examination of the mechanistic details(Walev et al, 2001; Morgan & Campbell, 1985). The fact that lysosomal hydrolases are secreted in a calcium dependent manner (Tam et al, 2010) upon PM injury and the observation that PM injury triggers massive endocytosis of vesicles, which look remarkably like endosomes of cells treated with bacterial sphingomyelinase(Idone et al, 2008; Zha et al, 1998) provided a first mechanistic explanation for removal of PM pores. Sphingomyelin is abundantly found in the PM(Simons & Raposo, 2009) and sphingomyelinases are capable of generating ceramide from sphingomyelin. Ceramide was shown to promote membrane invagination(Holopainen et al, 2000) and was implicated in the formation of intraluminal vesicles on multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), where 30 Introductioncytosolic neutral sphingomyelinase is responsible et The lysosomal enzyme acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) is secreted to the cell surface when they are exposed to membrane-damaging stress(Gulbins, 2003; Tam et al, 2010). There it acts on the outer leaflet of the PM, generating ceramide-rich micro domains(Schissel et al, 1998; van BLITTERSWIJK et al, 2003; Grassm\u00e9 et al, 2002) . These micro domains are absent during treatment with ASM inhibitors and in cells deficient for ASM during SLO treatment (Tam et al, 2010; Babiychuk et al, 2008). Importantly, under these conditions, membrane repair is inhibited and cells succumb to otherwise sub-lethal concentrations of SLO (Tam et al, 2010). This shows that ASM mediated ceramide generation and subsequent endocytosis of PM pores is required for membrane repair during PM pore formation. Once internalized by endocytosis, PM pores travel along the endosomal route to be degraded in MVBs or lysosomes(Corrotte et al, 2012). 31 Introduction3.9.2 ESCRT-III dependent shedding of PM pores The ESCRT machinery is a multiprotein complex, composed of several parts (ESCRT 0, I, II, III). The name, endosomal sorting complex required for transport, originates from its discovery in yeast where the ESCRT proteins, just like in all eukaryotic cells, are responsible for sorting and trafficking of proteins along the secretory pathway(Katzmann et al, 2002) . Most prominently, the ESCRT machinery is responsible for formation of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) in multivesicular bodies (MVBs)(Katzmann et al, 2002), as it is the only machinery capable of deforming membranes away from the cytosol, leading to generation of vesicles at the distal part of a membrane. Over the years, other functions of the ESCRT machinery, including cytokinesis(Carlton & Martin-Serrano, 2007; Morita et al, 2007), a role for the budding of several enveloped viruses (Morita & Sundquist, 2004) and a function for restoration of nuclear envelope restoration have been implicated(Raab et al, 2016; Denais et al, 2016). More recently, it has been shown convincingly by several groups that the ESCRT- III machinery has a function in PM repair(Jimenez et al, 2014; Scheffer et al, 2014). These studies could demonstrate that several components of the ESCRT machinery are enriched in membrane fractions of cells treated with the calcium ionophore ionomyin. Validation experiments showed that this recruitment is not only dependent on calcium influx, but is observed if the PM is damaged by different means. Laser wounding, detergent treatment, bacterial pore forming toxins and perforin treatment all induced clustering of the ESCRT- III component CHMP4 at the PM. Both groups showed that other ESCRT-III components are recruited as well during micro-laser wounding and that most components of the ESCRT 0, I, and II machineries are dispensable (except ALIX and ALG-2) for PM repair. Consequently, inhibition of ESCRT-III activity by either knock-down or expression of dominant-negative proteins inhibited membrane repair and lead to enhanced cell death during laser wounding, as damaged pieces of membrane could not be removed by ectocytosis (Jimenez et al, 2014; Scheffer et al, 2014). A recent study demonstrated that beyond repairing laser inflicted PM damage the ESCRT- III machinery also negatively controls necroptotic cell death. As discussed above, necroptosis involves pore formation at the PM by MLKL, leading to collapse of the ionic gradient across the PM and ultimately lysis of cells. The study could show that the ESCRT-III machinery is activated during necroptosis and recruited to MLKL positive parts of the PM, where it sheds 'bubbles' of membrane up to 0.5 \u00b5m in size. Inhibition of the ESCRT-III machinery resulted in enhanced cell death during necroptosis and prevented 'resuscitation' of cells. Resuscitation 32 Introductionis a phenomenon, where cells which have received a necroptotic stimulus (have exposed PS at the PM and are therefore Annexin-V positive) can come back to life if the stimulus is removed. Interestingly, premature death of cells during necroptosis leads to reduced cytokine secretion and T-cell cross-priming as stimulated cells have too little time to engage NF- B dependent signaling and cytokine production. This study for the first time implicated a role for membrane repair mechanism in the regulation of cellular death programs, showing an interesting connection between cellular survival and cell death pathways(Gong et al, 2017). 33 Introduction Figure 3.7 Plasma membrane repair mechanisms Damage or pore formation at the PM (middle) leads to calcium influx, which is essential for triggering both described membrane repair mechanisms. ASM dependent endocytosis (left part) is initiated by rapid secretion of ASM to the supernatant of cells, from secretory lysosomes. ASM hydrolyses sphingomyelin to ceramide around the site of exocytosis, leading to ceramide driven invagination of the damaged area of the membrane. Pores are sequestered within endosomes and travel to MVBs to be degraded. ESCRT dependent ectocytosis (right part) is initiated by activation of ALG-2 through calcium flux, which is turn recruits ALIX (ALG -2 interacting protein X). Components of the ESCRT-III machinery are consecutively recruited, leading to shedding of PM pores within ectosomes to restore PM integrity 34 Introduction3.10 Aim of the thesis During my PhD I was always intrigued by the simplicity of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway and how it works to protect the host from gram-negative pathogens. As the mechanisms downstream of caspase-11 activation were not well understood, my work focused on understanding these signaling events. I wanted to understand how caspase-11 acts to promote NLRP3 activation, executes pyroptosis through gasdermin-D and how the cell is capable of regulating pyroptosis downstream of caspase-11 activation. I also tried to identify unknown components of the non-canonical pathway by performing an unbiased forward genetic screen. Overall I aimed to improve our understanding of the signaling events elicited by activation of caspase-11 through intracellular LPS. 35 Aim of the thesis4 Results Research Article I: 10.1002/eji.201545772. Epub 2015 Aug 6 Statement of contribution: I performed all experiments described and wrote the manuscript together with Petr Broz 36 ResultsEur. and Petr Broz Focal Area Infection Biology, Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns or endogenous danger signals by a subset of cytosolic PRRs results in the assembly of multiprotein signaling complexes, so-called inflammasomes. Canonical inflammasomes are assembled NOD-likereceptor (NLR) or family members and activate caspase-1, which promotes the induction of pyroptosis and the release of mature interleukin-1 /-18. Recently, a non- canonical inflammasome pathway was discovered that results in caspase-11 activation in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the cytosol. Interestingly, caspase- 11 induces pyroptosis by itself, but requires NLRP3, the inflammasome adapter ASC, and caspase-1 to promote cytokine secretion. Here, we have studied the mechanism by whichcaspase-11 controls IL-1 secretion. Investigating NLRP3/ASC complex formation, we canonical by caspase-11 is a cell-intrinsic process and is inde-pendent of the release of danger signals. Furthermore, we show that active caspase-11 leads to a drop of intracellular potassium levels, which is necessary to activate NLRP3. Our study, therefore, sheds new light on the mechanism of noncanonical inflammasome signaling.

Besides their role in host defense [1], inflammasomes attract interest since deregulation of inflammasome signaling isalso linked to a number of hereditary and acquired inflammatory diseases [3]. Inflammasome receptors, such as NLRs and PYHINs, contain several functional domains that are thought to be involved in lig-and recognition. Direct binding of the ligand has been demon- strated for AIM2, which binds double-stranded DNA [4], and for the NAIP proteins, which bind flagellin and type 3 secretion systems J. Immunol. 2015. 45: 2927-2936 it remains unclear how the stimulus is recognized. This is particularly true for the NLRP3 inflammasome that is activatedby a variety of structurally and chemically distinct stimuli, rang- ing from pathogens and pore-forming toxin to crystalline particles and UV irradiation [5]. These results suggest that some signal/s common to all of these activators must be recognized. Currently, these common denominators are thought to be K +efflux [6, 7], 9], mitochon- drial ROS production and the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA [10, 11]. Nevertheless, despite these advances it remainsunclear if and how these events are causally linked. Investigating the response of murine macrophages to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and cholera toxin B, as well as other bac-terial inflammasome activators, Kayagaki et al. recently discovered a noncanonical inflammasome pathway that relies on caspase-11 [12]. Subsequent studies reported that this pathway was activatedby Gram-negative, but not by Gram-positive, bacteria, indicating a requirement for a conserved factor from Gram-negative bacte- ria [13, 14]. Consistently, it was later shown that Gram-negativebacterial LPS delivered to the cytosol by transfection or electropo- ration is sufcient to induce caspase-11 activation [15, 16]. While it was initially assumed that a cytosolic LPS receptor activates caspase-11, it was recently shown that caspase-11 as well as its human homologs caspase-4/5 recognize LPS directly via the CARDdomain [17]. Another particularity of the noncanonical inflamma- some pathway is that caspase-11 is able to induce a lytic cell death similarly to caspase-1, however, cannot by itself trigger IL-1 /- 18 release [12]. To promote cytokine [12]. However, to NLRP3 activation in this noncanonical inflamma- some pathway remains unclear. While some results suggest that caspase-11 forms a complex together with NLRP3/ASC and pro-caspase-1 [12, 14], others indicate that caspase-11 is upstream of NLRP3 activation [13]. Here, we have addressed the link between caspase-11 and NLRP3 activation upon LPS transfection. Ourresults showed that caspase-11 acts indeed upstream of NLRP3 activation and controlled the assembly of NLRP3-ASC complexes (ASC specks). This process was induced on a cell-autonomous leveland was independent of a released/secreted activator of NLRP3. Further investigations showed that caspase-11 activation led to a drop in intracellular K +concentrations and that this served as a trigger of canonical NLRP3 activation. Results NLRP3 activation by caspase-11 is a cell-autonomous process Caspase-11 activation following LPS transfection induces a lytic type of cell death (measured by the release of lactate dehydro- genase (LDH)), which is mostly components (Fig. 1A) [12, 15]. Interestingly, secretion of mature, processed IL-1 /-18 upon LPS transfection are absolutely dependent on pro-caspase-1 (Fig. 1B and F) [12, 15], indicatingthe existence of a noncanonical pathway of NLRP3 activation that involves caspase-11. In contrast to this pathway, treat- ment with the canonical NLRP3 stimulus nigericin resulted in comparable levels of cell death and cytokine production in WT and Casp11-decient cells, but not in Nlrp3-decient cells (Fig. 1F, Supporting Information Fig. 1A and B). Based on similar nd- ings, previous publications suggested that during LPS transfec- tion caspase-11 is either part of a noncanonical 14] or acts upstream of NLRP3 activation [13]. In order to determine if caspase-11 is required for the formation of NLRP3- ASC complexes, the absence of inflamma-tory caspases [2] and provide a robust measure of inflammasome complex formation. While WT cells formed detectable ASC specks (>60%) at 16 formationinNlrp3 /and Casp11/cells was Consistent with reduced ASC knockout of Nlrp3 or Casp11 abrogated nonsolublefractions of canonical inflam-masome activation by nigericin induced a comparable response in WT and Casp-11-decient macrophages (Fig. 1E, Supporting Information Fig. 1C and D). In conclusion, these results argue for a model in which active caspase-11 is upstream of a canonical NLRP3 inflammasome and against the existence a noncanonical NLRP3 complex. The NLRP3 inflammasome responds to a variety of chemically and structurally diverse stimuli, among them are released dangersignals such as extracellular ATP [1]. To address if caspase-11-induced host-cell lysis results in the release of cytosolic content and the activation of NLRP3 in neighboring cells, we assayed inflammasome activation in the of Nlrp3/,a n d Casp11/BMDMs were LPS and 50 mM of the osmoprotectant glycinewas added 1 h post LPS transfection. Extracellular glycine blocked release of and Nlrp3 / BMDMs as assayed by the release of LDH (Fig. 1A) or the dan-ger signal HMGB1 (Fig. 1F). Addition of glycine, however, did not result in reduced levels of NLRP3 activation, as IL-1 release remained unchanged (Fig. 1B and F), indicating that lysis and the release of cytosolic contents were not a trigger of NLRP3 acti- vation. Consistently, glycine treatment did also not block complex assembly as ASC speck formation and ASC oligomer-ization remained unchanged (Fig. 1C-E). Interestingly, glycine treatment release of caspase-1 p10 and NLRP3, prob- ably lytic cells(Fig. 1F). Since cells containing active caspase-11 might also release or secrete danger signals independently of lysis, we used cocul-ture experiments to determine if caspase-11-mediated NLRP3 activation is process. NLRP3 inflammasome on a cell-autonomous level independently of the release of danger signals.

If a factor released fromcaspase-11-procient cells is sufcient to trigger NLRP3 activation upon LPS transfection, we expected to see formation of ASC specks Casp11-decient cells. Analysis of ASC speck forma- tion in labeled and unlabeled populations showed that caspase- 11-decient BMDMs were not able to initiate ASC speck tion and consequently had WT or Asc /BMDMs transfected with LPS (Fig. 1H and I, Supporting Information Fig. 2). In conclusion, our resultsdemonstrated that active caspase-11 triggers a canonical NLRP3pathway in a cell-intrinsic manner, independent of the release of danger signals or cytokines from adjacent cells.Involvement of mitochondria in NLRP3 activation by caspase-11 Since canonical NLRP3 activation has been linked to mitochondrial ROS production and ROS scavengers are known to reduce NLRP3 inflammasome activation [11], we next investigated if mito-chondrial ROS generation was required for caspase-11-mediated NLRP3 activation. Pretreatment BMDMs with before transfec- tion or nigericin stimulation resulted in a signicant reduction of reduction in IL-1 release (Fig. 2A). Consistently, NAC reduced cell death in nigericin-treated cells. However, NAC also reduced cell death levels in LPS-transfected cells indicating that NAC interferes with caspase-11 activation or that ROS is required for caspase-11- induced cell death (Fig. 2A).

Consistent with reduced inflammasome activation, NAC reduced caspase-11-induced mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 2B) but NAC could not reduce mitochondrial ROS that was induced during AIM2 inflammasome activation by deoxy adenosine:deoxythymidinde transfection. These data questioned the ability of NAC to specically reduce mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 2B) and suggested that NAC might have unspecic effects on caspase activation. In order to solve this discrepancy between NLRP3-induced IL-1 production and mitochondrial ROS levels, we decided to use the ROS scavenger MitoTEMPO (Sigma-Aldrich), which should specif- presence of MitoTEMPO; how- ever, nigericin induced IL-1 production as well as cell death levels for both stimuli were unaffected (Fig. 2C). Furthermore,analysis of mitochondrial ROS levels showed no difference forWT macrophages stimulated in presence of MitoTEMPO or avehicle control indicating that MitoTEMPO might unspecicallyreduce NLRP3-induced IL-1 production during LPS transfection (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, when analyzing the effect of MitoTEMPOon the NLRC4 inflammasome, which is directly activated by flag-ellin or components of type 3 secretion systems [1], we also noticed that increasing incubation times in medium contain- ing MitoTEMPO diminished cell death and IL-1 production, indicative of off-target effects on caspase-1 activation or IL-1 secretion (Fig. 2E). We concluded that due to off-target effects ROS scavengers cannot be used to study the involve- ment of mitochondria in caspase-11-driven NLRP3 activation, yet we cannot exclude a possible involvement of mitochondrialROS or other factors of mitochondrial physiology such as the release of oxidized mitochondrial DNA or the perturbation of the (A-D) BMDMs from WT and Nlrp3-/-mice were primed with LPS for 3 h and incubated in Buffer A (see Materials and Methods).

K+efflux is sufcient to activate NLRP3 Recent work suggested that K+efflux is a common event dur- ing the activation of the canonical NLRP3 pathway by a num- ber of different stimuli [7]. In agreement with these data, we found that incubation of cells in K+-free medium was sufcient to induce caspase-1 processing and the release of mature IL-1 and from WT cells, but not from Nlrp3-decient cells (Fig. 3A and B). Furthermore, incubation in K+-free medium was also suf- cient to drive assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome as deter- mined by quantication of (Fig. 3D) and ASC oligomerization 3C). We next validated that incuba- tion in K+-free medium indeed resulted in K+-efflux from BMDMs using the cell-permeable, fluorescent indicator to BMDMs were incubated in K+-free medium, labeled with PBFI-AM and subjected to flow cytometry based analysis forPBFI intensity [18] (Fig. 3E). To reduce the possibility that activecaspase-1 triggers cell death and subsequent loss of intracellular K +, we used Casp1//Casp11/BMDMs for this analysis and added a near-infrared live-dead marker (L/D, Life Technologies)to distinguish between live and cells (Fig. 3E). Incubation of Casp1 //Casp11/BMDMs with K+-free medium resulted signicant decrease of PBFI mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) in the L/Dnegativepopulation (Fig 3F). These results indicated that K+- free medium was sufcient to initiate a measurable drop in intra- cellular K+concentrations, in line with published results obtained by ICP-OES (inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spec-trometry) [7]. To validate our method, we next compared K + efflux from WT and Nlrp3/BMDMs treated with nigericin. Similarly to K+-free medium, nigericin treatment in a decrease of PBFI-MFI in the L/Dnegativepop- ulation in WT and Nlrp3-decient cells (Fig. 3G). Similar results were obtained by using PI to separate live and dead cells (Sup-porting Information Fig. 3). Taken together, these results showed C/circlecopyrt2015 Verlag GmbH NLRP3 activation.

Active caspase-11 triggers K+efflux, which is essential for NLRP3 activation Since our data indicated that K+efflux is sufcient to drive NLRP3 assembly, we tested if caspase-11 elicits a drop of intracellular K+ levels for different timepoints, labeled with PBFI-AM and PI as described above and their intracellular PBFI staining was quantied by flow cytometry. Analysis of the quadrant blots over time showed that in the majority of cells acquired PI stainingvery quickly (starting at 60 min) leading to the appearance of a PBFI highPIhighpopulation of cells (Fig. 4A). This population then proceeded to loose PBFI staining leading to its disappearance at later timepoints (120 min) and the appearance of a PBFIlow PIhighpopulation (Fig. 4A), which represents the nal state of cells following caspase-11 activation. These results suggest thatcaspase-11-induced membrane permeabilization occurred prior to K +efflux (as measured by PBFI staining), and that this population quickly proceeded to become PBFIlowprobably by complete loss C/circlecopyrt2015 45: 2927-2936 Innate immunity 2933 of membrane integrity and the subsequent loss of K+ions or the PBFI dye itself. Yet, it remained unclear if after K+loss these PBFIhighPIhighcells were activating NLRP3 and forming ASC specks (Fig. 4A). To assess if this caspase-11-induced drop of intracellular K+ levels was necessary for NLRP3 activation after intracellular delivery of LPS, we next transfected WT BMDMs with LPS ineither regular medium or medium with increasing K +concen- trations. As described previously, we isoosmotically substitutedNaCl with KCl in these media [7]. Increasing extracellular K + concentrations did not result in reduced levels of cell death in LPS-transfected BMDMs as assayed by the release of LDH and the danger signal HMGB1 (Fig. 4B, Supporting Information Fig. 4A).In contrast, extracellular K +signicant decreased release and caspase-1 in a concentration-dependent manner(Fig. 4B, Supporting Information Fig. 4A). Consistent with reducedlevels of NLRP3 activity, high extracellular K +levels resulted in InformationFig. 4B). As a control, we also analyzed the effects of increased extracellular K +on the canonical NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflamma- contrast to the noncanonical pathway, we observed areduction in both cell death and cytokine release in WT BMDMs treated with nigericin in presence increasing concentrationsof K +. Furthermore, ASC oligomerization, caspase-1 processing, and release upon nigericin treatment as well (Fig. 4B, Supporting Information Fig. 4A andB). This is consistent with the notion that K +efflux is upstream of NLRP3 and thus high extracellular K+blocks both cell death and IL-1 release. As expected, NLRC4 inflammasome activation by Salmonella typhimurium infection was not affected by high extracellular KCl concentrations (Fig. 4B, Supporting InformationFig. 4A and B). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that caspase-11 activation by LPS transfection leads to a drop of intracellular K +levels, which is dispensable for the induction of cell death, but required for NLRP3 activation, thus highlighting two separate pathways downstream of cytosolic LPS. Discussion The exact cellular events involved in the activation of the NLRP3inflammasome are still poorly understood [1]. Lysosomal dam-age, K +efflux, ROS, and mitochondrial DNA have been brought forward, but if and how these events are causally connected isunclear. The the that yet another, noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome exists. Thedata presented here argue that the inflammasome pathway does not involve a noncanonical NLRP3 inflammasome associated with or containing caspase-11, but that rather caspase-11 is upstream of NLRP3 activation. Of note, our data demon- strate that this pathway does not involve a released factor, but proceeds cell autonomously, thus excluding the possibility thatNLRP3 senses caspase-11-induced pyroptosis in neighboring cells.Interestingly, we could show that the key event during caspase-11-triggered NLRP3 activation is K +efflux, while the involvement of mitochondrial ROS production could not be denitely determined due to off-target effects of ROS scavengers. In agreement with pre- vious ndings by Munoz-Planillo et al. [7], we show that K+efflux induced by K+-free medium is sufcient to induce NLRP3 assembly and activation. It remains, however, unclear how active caspase-11 promotes a drop in intracellular K +levels\u2014that is, what target proteins need to be cleaved by caspase-11 to trigger K +efflux or if caspase-11 permeabilizes the membrane directly. Notably, ourresults indicate that during cytosolic LPS delivery, active caspase- 11 leads to massive membrane permeabilization in a majority of cells, which can be measured by PI influx and which could at thesame time lead to loss of K +from the cell. Yet it could not be directly assessed if these cells also activate NLRP3 before lyzingcompletely. Given the large number of these cells in the total pop-ulation, it however seems probable that although these cells have become PI positive, they are still procient in activating the NLRP3 inflammasome upon membrane permeabilization and loss of K+. Interestingly, this it would indicate that \"cell death\" as measuredby membrane permeabilization does not exclude cellular processes such as NLRP3 activation from happening. Further work such live- cell imaging of LPS-transfected cells and additional studies aimed at identifying caspase-11 target proteins might therefore not onlybroaden our understanding of how caspases induce lytic cell death and what happens to cells after pyroptosis, but also identify pro- teins involved in regulating K +levels or membrane permeability. Materials and methods Mice Casp1/Casp11/(caspase-1-KO), Asc/,Casp11/,a n d Nlrp3/mice have been described [6, 12]. Mice were bred in the animal facility of the University of Basel.

Cytokine and LDH release measurement IL-1 was measured by ELISA (eBioscience). LDH was measured using LDH Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Clontech). To normalize forspontaneous lysis, the percentage of LDH release was calculated as (LDH infected - LDH uninfected)/(LDH total lysis - PI influx measurement Following stimulation/infection of BMDMs, 10\u00d7 PI was added to 3.9 M nal concentration and the plate was incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0 C5 %C O 2.

After labeling, the plate was transferred on ice, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and stained using the near- infrared L/D marker (1:1000) in PBS for 20 min on ice in thedark.

L/D negative cells were analyzed for MitoSOX staining on a BD Canto II Flow Cytometer. At least 3000 live cells were acquired. Stimulation for treatment with inhibitors For treatment with NAC and MitoTEMPO, cells were primed overnight with Pam 3CSK 4and preincubated with the inhibitor in twice the nal concentration in 100 L (PI/LDH/ELISA) or 200L (MitoSOX) of Opti-MEM for 30 min, prior to stimulation, if not indicated differently in the gure legends.

These caspases are activated within multi-proteininflammasome complexes that assemble in response to pathogensand endogenous danger signals. Pyroptotic cell death has beenproposed to proceed via the formation of a plasma membranepore, but the underlying molecular mechanism has remainedunclear. Recently, gasdermin D (GSDMD), a member of the ill-characterized gasdermin protein family, was identified as a caspasesubstrate and an essential mediator of pyroptosis. GSDMD is thus acandidate for pyroptotic pore formation. Here, we characterizeGSDMD function in live cells and in vitro . We show that the N- terminal fragment of caspase- 1-cleaved GSDMD rapidly targets the membrane fraction of macrophages and that it induces the forma-tion of a plasma membrane pore. In vitro , the N-terminal fragment of caspase- 1-cleaved recombinant GSDMD tightly binds liposomes and forms large permeability pores. Visualization of liposome-inserted GSDMD at nanometer resolution by cryo-electron andatomic force microscopy shows circular pores with variable ringdiameters around 20nm. Overall, these data demonstrate that GSDMD is the direct and final executor of pyroptotic cell death.

Caspase-1 is activated within large multi-protein complexes termed inflammasomes, which are assembled bythe protein pyrin or members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) andPYHIN protein families (Latz et al, 2013; von Moltke et al, 2013). These proteins act as cytosolic pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)and detect a variety of pathogen-associated molecular patterns(PAMPs) or endogenous danger signals (DAMPs). In contrast, thebacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS), one of thestrongest immune-system activators, leads to the assembly of \"non-canonical\" inflammasomes through activation of caspase-4,caspase-5 or caspase-11 (Kayagaki et al, 2011, 2013; Hagar et al, 2013; Shi et al, 2014). The downstream signaling pathways that follow the activation of inflammatory caspases and how the active caspases initiate theseevents are still poorly understood (Lamkanfi, 2011). Initial work hasidentified the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1 bas a key substrate of caspase-1 (Thornberry et al, 1992). Subsequently, it was found that caspase-1, as well as caspase-11 and its humanorthologs caspase-4 and caspase-5, induces a novel programmed celldeath pathway that is characterized by cell swelling, lysis, and therelease of cytoplasmic content (Fink & Cookson, 2007; Kayagakiet al, 2011; Shi et al, 2014), presumably as a result of the formation of membrane pores (Fink et al, 2008). Since this type of cell death is morphologically distinct from apoptosis and intrinsically pro-inflammatory, it was named pyroptosis, from the Greek pyro (fire or fever) and ptosis (to fall) (Bergsbaken et al, 2009). The physiologi- cal function of pyroptosis is thought to be the prevention of intra-cellular pathogen replication and to re-expose pathogens toextracellular killing mechanisms (Miao et al, 2010). Several landmark studies have recently identified GSDMD (gas- dermin D), a member of the gasdermin protein family, as an essen-tial mediator of pyroptosis in human and murine cells (He et al, 2015; Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015). GSDMD required for pyroptosis induction after canonical and GSDMD (GSDMD Nterm) was found sufficient to induce cell death with the morphological features of pyroptosis (Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015), and overexpression of the C-terminal domain GSDMDCtermwas found to block GSDMDNterm-dependent cell death 1Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland 2Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zurich, Basel, Switzerland 3Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Forum 1, Basel, Switzerland *Corresponding author.

These results gave rise to the hypothesis that caspase-dependent cleavage releases the N-terminal domain from an inhibitory interaction with the C-terminus, allowing GSDMDNtermto induce cell death by a yet undefined mechanism. Since pyroptosishad long been speculated to involve the formation of a plasmamembrane pore, immediate destruction of the electrochemical gradi-ent, and subsequent osmotic lysis of the host cell (Lamkanfi, 2011),it is likely that GSDMD Ntermeither promotes the formation of this pore or itself has pore-forming activity (Broz, 2015). Here, we inves-tigate the functional role of GSDMD Ntermin live cells and in vitro . We demonstrate that after cleavage by caspase-1, GSDMDNterm targets cellular membranes and that it induces the formation of alarge permeability pore in the plasma membrane. In vitro experi- ments with purified recombinant GSDMD show that GSDMD Nterm forms large pores in liposomes. We visualize these with cryo-electron and atomic force microscopy. Overall, these results closethe gaps in the pyroptotic signaling pathway by providing the proofthat GSDMD is the final and direct executor of pyroptotic cell death. Results The N-terminal GSDMD fragment induces the formation of alarge plasma membrane pore Pyroptotic cell death involves the formation of a plasma membrane pore, cell swelling, and rupture of the plasma membrane. To investi-gate whether GSDMD, a recently identified mediator of pyroptosis,mediates pore formation directly, we developed a doxycycline-inducible system to express the N-terminal fragment (GSDMD Nterm) of mouse GSDMD in HEK293T cells. in HEK293T cells harboring the GSDMD Nterm-expressing plasmid, but not in cells harboring a vector control, in a concentra-tion-dependent manner (Fig 1A). To characterize whetherGSDMD Ntermexpression induced a lytic type of cell death, character- istic for pyroptosis, we next measured the amount of (lactatedehydrogenase) release after doxycycline-induced expression of theGSDMD Nterm(Fig 1B). Increasing levels of GSDMDNtermexpression resulted in increased levels of LDH release, indicating that ectopicexpression of the GSDMD Nterminduced death through cell lysis. Microscopy analysis showed that GSDMDNterm-induced death had the morphological features of pyroptosis, that is, cell swelling and nuclear condensation. To estimate the size of the GSDMDNterm-induced plasma membrane pore, we next employed an osmoprotection assaybased on the addition of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) of increasingmolecular weight. Addition of these high-molecular polymers canprevent water influx through pores and the resulting swelling andosmotic lysis, if the molecular diameter of the agent is larger thanthe diameter of the pore (Appendix We inducedGSDMD Ntermexpression by doxycycline addition in HEK293T cells in the presence of PEGs and measured LDH release as a readout forosmotic lysis and ofplasma membrane pore (Fig 1C and D). Only the largestsized agent, PEG3000, was able to reduce LDH release partially,while smaller PEGs did not reduce cell lysis. Importantly, PEG3000did not prevent PI influx, indicating that it does not block the poredirectly, but functions as an osmoprotectant. PEGs in the range of600-3,000 Da did not induce significant levels of cell death whenadded to cells (Appendix Fig S1B), but larger PEGs could not beused, since they proved to be cytotoxic. Infection of primary bone pyrop- tosis and cytokine release (Appendix and estimatethe size of the GSDMD-dependent plasma membrane pore inBMDMs, we measured cell lysis as a function of time in the presenceof PEGs of increasing size (Fig 1E and F). Consistent with theosmoprotection experiment done in HEK293T cells, we observedthat only PEG3000 had a small protective effect, while all smallerPEGs did not prevent pyroptosis. PI influx was not affected by anyof the osmoprotectants. IL-1 brelease was also partially affected by PEG treatment (Appendix Fig S1E); consistent with the observationthat pyroptosis is required for efficient release of the maturecytokine in BMDMs (Shi et al, 2015). Overall, these experiments suggest that GSDMD-dependent pyroptosis involves the formationof a plasma membrane pore with an inner diameter of over 3.5 nm,the estimated molecular size of PEG3000 (Scherrer & GSDMD GSDMD Ntermmight itself form a pore in the plasma membrane or alternatively initiate other events that result in pore formation (Broz, 2015). To define the fate of GSDMDNtermafter caspase-1- dependent cleavage of GSDMD, we followed caspase-1 activation,GSDMD processing, and cell death over time in immortalizedwild-type macrophages infected with S. typhimurium (Fig 2A, processed caspase-1 p20 fragment, an indi-cator of caspase-1 activation, appeared within 20 min after infectionin the supernatant of macrophages. GSDMD processing correlatedwith caspase-1 activation and was detectable in the cell lysate aswell as in the cell supernatant. LDH release was also detectable atthe same time points (Fig 1F and Appendix Fig S1C). Based onthese data, we decided determine the subcellular localization offull-length GSDMD and GSDMD Ntermin either uninfected cells or in cells infected with S. typhimurium for 10 and 20 min. Cells were harvested at each of these time points and subjected to subcellularfractionation as outlined (Fig 2B). GSDMD full length was exclu-sively found in the cytosolic fraction (S150) in uninfected cells(Fig 2C and Appendix Fig S2B), in line with the notion that it is asoluble, cytosolic protein. After infection, full-length GSDMD, butvery little GSDMD Ntermwas detected in the S150 fraction. Instead, the majority of GSDMDNtermwas found in the P150 fraction and in the P10 fraction, correlating with the presence of the plasmamembrane marker Na +K+ATPase. The Na+K+ATPase was also strongly present in the P10, presumably since it is secreted viathe ER/Golgi marker membrane, did not correlate with theGSDMD Ntermand was mainly found in the P0.7 and P10 fractions, but not in the P150 fraction. Overall, these results suggest that theGSDMD Ntermtargets membranes after caspase-1-mediated cleavage. To characterize the interaction, we isolated plasma membrane frac-tions of BMDMs after S. typhimurium infection and subjected them to different treatments (Fig 2D).

Only the disruption of the membrane with low concentra-tions of the detergent SDS (0.1%) was able to fully solubilizeGSDMD Nterm.

Thus, GSDMDNtermintegrates into cellular membranes in a cholesterol-independent manner, and this integra- tion is associated with formation of a pore and cell lysis. The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD associates to liposomes in vitro These findings encouraged us to attempt the reconstitution of apossible pore-forming function of GSDMD expression for full-length human GSDMD inE. coli BL21(DE3) expression cells. The protein expressed well with yields of 1.5 mg l /C01cell culture. Notably, following the same proto- col, GSDMDNtermdid not express in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells to detectable levels by SDS -PAGE, in agreement with the hypothesis that the protein might have a toxic effect on the host cells. Full-length GSDMD was isolated and purified to homogeneity(Appendix Fig S3A). It elutes as a monodisperse, homogeneouselution peak from size exclusion chromatography, at the position ofthe expected monomeric species. Thermal denaturation showed amelting point of 43 \u00b0C, indicating that the protein is folded and can be thermally denatured. Upon incubation with different humancaspases, we confirmed that recombinant GSDMD is cleaved bycaspase-1, but not by the apoptotic caspase-3 or caspase-8 (Shi et al, 2015). Recombinant GSDMD is thus a functional substrate of itsnative enzyme. Then, we characterized the time dependence ofGSDMD 3A). About 5 nM in C-terminal (GSDMDCterm) solution in the absence of a lipidic phase, GSDMDNtermis not soluble and forms aggregates, as demonstrated in a cross-linking experiment (Fig 3B).After cleavage, the N-terminus is while the 22-kDa GSDMD Ctermremains soluble. To determine the poorly soluble GSDMDNtermassociates with lipids, GSDMD was incubated in the presence or with unilamellar liposomes made of either 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) or from E. coli polar lipid extract. Ultracentrifugation allowed for separation of the AC BD Figure 2. GSDMDNtermlocalizes to cellular membranes after inflammasome activation.

Whereas full-length GSDMD did not associate with either the DMPC or the E. coli polar extract liposomes, the GSDMDNtermfully associated with either of the two membrane mimetics. GSDMDCtermdid not associate with the lipo- somes (Fig 3C). Therefore, the soluble GSDMDCtermdomain is acting in full-length GSDMD not only as an inhibitor of GSDMDNterm but also as a solubility tag for the intrinsically insoluble and lipo-philic GSDMD Nterm, it from aggregation cleaved, GSDMDNtermassociates strongly to available membranes. DMPC liposomes are made from a chemicallypure compound, showing that membrane association byGSDMD Ntermdoes not require any specific receptors in the membrane. The N-terminal fragment of GSDMD forms pores in liposomes Next, we asked whether liposome-associated GSDMDNtermforms transmembrane pores. Liposomes filled with a fluorophore 6-carboxyfluorescein were incubatedwith recombinant full-length GSDMD in the presence or absence ofactive caspase-1 (Fig 4). Release of the fluorophore from the lipo-some interior results in a strong reduction in the concentration-dependent self-quenching effect and consequently in an increase ofthe overall fluorescence signal, as demonstrated by chemicalrupture of the liposomes with the detergent Triton X in a controlexperiment (Appendix Fig S5). Neither caspase-1 nor full-lengthGSDMD alone was able to release dye from the liposomes, but inthe presence of both GSDMD and caspase-1, dye release wasobserved, indicating the formation of permeability pores with opendiameters of at least the molecular size of 6-carboxyfluorescein(/C251 nm). The dye release reaction from liposomes includes at least three kinetic steps: the first step is the proteolytic cleavage ofGSDMD by caspase-1, the second step is the membrane associa-tion, and the third step is pore formation of GSDMD Nterm. Whereas the first step follows classical Michaelis -Menten kinetics, the reac- tion mechanisms of the second and third steps may include addi-tional oligomerization steps with non-trivial concentrationdependence. In an attempt to visualize the concentration depen-dence of the overall reaction, we measured the kinetics of dyerelease as a function of GSDMD concentration at a constantcaspase-1 concentration of 5 nM (Fig 4A). At a GSDMD concentra-tion of 520 nM, the dye release is very efficient so that in 20 min,already more than 90% of the total fluorescence signal is observed.With decreasing GSDMD concentration, the overall reaction ratedecreases, but the overall dye release nonetheless reaches 100%,showing that sufficient GSDMD is available to permeate all lipo-somes. This conclusion breaks down at a GSDMD concentration of65 nM, where only about 50% of the liposomes are permeated atlate time points. We then measured the kinetics of dye release as a function of the caspase-1 concentration in the range 1.2- 15 nM, while keeping the GSDMD concentration constant at 130 nM (Fig 4B). In this experi-ment, by decreasing the concentration of caspase-1, we expect areduction of the availability of cleaved GSDMD Ntermby the initial protease cleavage step, and consequently, we observe a decelerationof the dye release reaction. The total amount of GSDMD is alwayssufficient to permeate all liposomes in the setup, and consequently,we observe 100% dye release levels in all measurements. AB C Figure 3.

The EMBO Journal Vol35|N o online: 52 ResultsImportantly, GSDMD did not only permeate liposomes made of bacterial lipid extract (Fig 4A and B), but similarly also liposomesfrom a eukaryotic source (Fig 4C). In a next experiment, weexamined the functionality of the I105N mutant of GSDMD. Thismutant had played a key role in the discovery of GSDMD, since ithad previously been identified as a loss-of-function mutant in mousemodels (Kayagaki et al, 2015). We generated the analogous mutation I104N in GSDMD and expressed and purified the mutantprotein with the same biochemical protocols as the cleaved liposome permeability by pore formation.

For each experiment, a representative from three independent experiments is shown. The corresponding raw data are shown in Appendix Figure S 5. \u00aa2016 The Authors The EMBO Journal o from wild-type GSDMD (Appendix Fig S4A and B). In the dye release assay, at high protein concentrations,GSDMD I104Nis able to form functional pores with only minor differences to the wild-type protein. At reduced proteins concentra-tions, however, it showed reduced activity compared to thewild-type protein (Fig 4E and F). Consistent with these data andpreviously published work (Kayagaki et al, 2015), we found that GSDMD I104Ncould also induce cell death of HEK293T cells when expressed by a doxycycline-inducible promoter, although signifi-cantly less than the WT protein (Appendix Fig S4D). Similarly,expression the in immortalizedGsdmd -deficient mouse macrophages partially restored pyroptosis after Salmonella infection when compared to wild-type human GSDMD (Appendix Fig S4C). The quantitative differences observedhere may well translate into an effective loss-of-function effect inwhole animals, and our experiments thus confirm the functionaldeficiency of the mouse I105N mutant. As an additional controlexperiment, we verified that uncleaved GSDMD full length does notform pores in liposomes (Appendix Fig S5E and F). Next, weaddressed the the GSDMD pore in liposomes by usingcarbohydrate-conjugated fluorophores as markers. These fluo-rophores have differently long carbohydrate chains attached, resultingin different overall Stokes radii. We selected three different fluo-rophores with Stokes radii of 33, 45, and 85 A , but all of them were still released by the GSDMD pore (Fig 4G- I). This suggests that the pyroptosis pore formed by GSDMD Ntermcan reach diameters of at least 15 nm, in full agreement with the cellular experiments. Visualization of GSDMD pores We employed two methods to resolve pores of GSDMDNtermin lipo- somes at nanometer resolution. full-length GSDMD in theabsence of caspase-1 did not result in visual distortions of the lipo-somes (Appendix Fig S6B). However, upon addition of caspase-1and subsequent incubation, large ruptures of the liposome structurewere observed. In these preparations, the liposome surface featuresnumerous large rings of dense material with inner diameters of/C2520 nm (Fig 5A -D and areformed by GSDMD Ntermand although the liposomes appear completely covered by the assemblies, from the available contrast ofthe micrographs, it remains inconclusive, whether these rings arelipid-filled protrusions or actual transmembrane pores. The lack ofcontrast also did not allow for a clear identification of the differentshapes of GSDMD oligomers. To characterize the assembly of thetransmembrane pores convincingly, we thus imaged GSDMD oligo-mers and pore formation on liposomes by atomic force microscopy(AFM). In an initial control experiment, we adsorbed either GSDMDalone, or caspase-1 alone, or GSDMD and caspase-1 together tofreshly cleaved mica, which we used as sample support in our AFMstudies (Appendix Fig S7A -D). GSDMD and caspase-1 readily adsorbed to the negatively charged hydrophilic mica surface asmonomers or small oligomers, but did not assemble into arcs orrings. After this, we incubated liposomes composed of E. coli polar lipids with GSDMD and caspase-1 for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C and adsorbed the sample onto freshly cleaved mica. The AFM topographsrecorded in buffer solution showed that adsorption to mica,the liposomes opened as single-layered membrane patches(Appendix Fig S7E). At higher resolution, the topographs showedGSDMD bound the membranes and oligomers (Fig 6A- E /C6s.d.; n=218) from the lipid surface and that each of them could form pores throughthe lipid membrane (Fig 6F and G). Occasionally, arcs and slitscombined into ring-shaped structures, which were not yet perfectlycircular and only partially associated with the formation ofmembrane pores. Several pore-forming toxins (PFTs) have shownthe ability to bind to lipid membranes as oligomers forming arcs orslits that can dynamically rearrange on the membrane surface toform larger pores (Leung et al, 2014; Sonnen et al, 2014; Mulvihill et al, 2015; Podobnik al, 2015). In agreement with this observa- tion, GSDMD arcs and slits were found that presumably fused intoperfect ring-shaped GSDMD Ntermoligomers of variable diameters, with an average of 21 nm (Fig 6F -H). These AFM topographs thus clearly show a structural variability of the GSDMDNterm assembly, which is, however, determined to eventually lead to theassembly of ring-like structures.

Although the morphologicalfeatures of pyroptotic cell death indicated the formation of a plasmamembrane pore and subsequent lysis of the cell (Lamkanfi, 2011),the molecules involved in pyroptosis induction had remainedelusive. The recent identification of GSDMD as an essential mediatorof pyroptosis significantly expanded our understanding of pyroptoticcell death (He et al, 2015; Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015), but A FG HBC DE Figure 6. Characterization of GSDMDNtermpores by atomic force microscopy. A AFM topograph of GSDMDNtermbound to lipid membranes showing arc-, slit-, and AFM topographs and height profiles of GSDMDNtermoligomers (red curves). Height profiles were measured along the red lines in the topographs. Dashed zero lines ( 0nm) indicate the surface of the lipid membrane; heights of </C04nm indicate that the oligomers formed transmembrane pores. Topographs were taken in buffer solution ( 150 NaCl, 20mM Hepes, pH 7.8) at room temperature. The experiment was reproduced at least three times using independent liposome and GSDMD preparations. Scale bars of topographs correspond to 50nm and of height profiles 10nm. The full color range of the AFM topographs corresponds to a vertical scale (height) of 20nm.

Inthis work, we have shown that the N-terminal fragment of GSDMD,GSDMD Nterm, can form pores with average diameters of 21 nm in artificial liposomes, as well as large pores in the plasma membraneof cells (Figs 5 and 6). GSDMD oligomers were found to formpre-pore states consisting of arcs, slits, and rings. Each of theseoligomeric states had a certain probability to also show a pore state,among which the GSDMD rings with their variable diameterformed the largest transmembrane pores. The variable pore sizesuggests that GSDMD possesses an intrinsic high structural vari-ability and that GSDMD arcs and slits represent intermediates thatpresumably may fuse toward the ring-shaped structures, similar toobservations for several other pore-forming toxins (PFTs) thatdynamically rearrange on the membrane surface (Leung et al, 2014; Sonnen et al, 2014; Mulvihill et al, 2015; Podobnik et al, 2015). Importantly, our in vitro assays show that the formation of the GSDMD pore does not require other proteins as co-factors ormembrane receptors, demonstrating that GSDMD Ntermis the sole and final executor of pyroptotic cell death (Fig 7). While thismanuscript was in revision, other reports have been published thatconfirm our findings that the N-terminal fragment of GSDMDcauses pyroptosis through the formation of a plasma membranepore and that demonstrate that the N-terminal domains of othergasdermin family members share this pore-forming activity(Aglietti et al, 2016; Ding et al, 2016). The placement and function of GSDMD in the canonical and non-canonical inflammasome pathway strongly resembles theplacement and function of Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein) in theapoptotic cell death pathways (Youle & Strasser, 2008). Bax is thefinal executor of apoptosis and forms a large pore in the mitochon-drial outer membrane. Interestingly, whereas both proteins formlarge permeability pores in their respective target membranes, theirmechanism of activation is entirely different. Whereas GSDMD isactivated proteolytic cleavage, Bax is activated Bcl-2 family of proteins (Gavathiotis et al,2 0 0 8 ;C z a b o t a r et al, 2013). A strong difference can also be expected for the atomic structure of the two proteins. Bax features a bundle of nine a-helices (Suzuki et al, 2000), thereby burying the two presumed pore-forming helices in its central core. The prediction of secondary structureelements shows that GSDMD Ntermconsists mainly of b-strand secondary structure, whereas the soluble GSDMDCtermconsists of a-helical secondary structure (Appendix Fig S8). Thus, while Bax resembles the bacterial pore-forming colicins, structural studies of themembrane-inserted form of GSDMD will be of highest interest. Another functionally related pathway is necroptotic cell death, which is for instance initiated by TNF (tumor necrosis factor)- aor the engagement of Toll-like receptor caspase-8activity (Pasparakis & Vandenabeele, 2015). Necroptosis involvesthe formation of it charac-terized by cell lysis (Pasparakis & Vandenabeele, 2015). Recentwork has demonstrated that recruitment of MLKL to RIP3 and MLKLphosphorylation results in the conformational change that leads tothe exposure of its four-helix bundle domain (FHBD) and oligomer-ization of MLKL (Murphy et al, 2013). Binding of the FHBD to negatively charged phosphatidylinositol phosphates has beenproposed to recruit MLKL to the plasma membrane allowing it todirectly permeabilize the membrane by forming a pore (Dondelingeret al, 2014; Su et al, 2014; Wang et al, 2014). Alternatively, it has been also proposed that plasma membrane-bound MLKL recruits Ca 2+ or Na+ion channels to permeabilize the membrane (Cai et al,2 0 1 4 ; Chen et al, 2014). Thus, although the steps leading up to necroptosis are markedly different from pyroptosis, the execution of both types oflytic cell death involves the formation of plasma membrane pores. The fact that GSDMD targets membranes after cleavage by caspases and forms permeability pores also sheds some light on thefunction of the regulatory C-terminal domain. Cleavage of GSDMDby inflammatory caspases results in the release of the GSDMDC-terminal fragment (Kayagaki et al, 2015; Shi et al, 2015), but overexpression of GSDMD Cterm, which was found to bind GSDMDNterm, results in the inhibition of cell death (Shi et al, 2015). This gave rise to a model in which cleavage releases an intramolecu-lar autoinhibition exerted by GSDMD Ctermon the thus preventing GSDMDNtermto unleash its cytotoxic activity. Interest- ingly, we have observed that GSDMDCtermis a soluble protein, while GSDMDNtermis insoluble and aggregates, when GSDMD is cleaved in the absence of a target membrane (Fig 3). This result supports aslightly different model in which GSDMD Ctermdoes not only act as an inhibitory domain, but simultaneously also as a solubility tag forthe N-terminal domain, maybe by shielding certain hydrophobic oramphipathic segments required for membrane insertion. Based onthese functions, the alternative names pore-forming domain (PFD)and solubilizing inhibitory domain (SID) appear well suited for theGSDMD Ntermand GSDMDCterm, respectively. Figure 7. Model for GSDMD-mediated pyroptotic cell death. Canonical inflammasomes act as sensors for a variety of pathogens and cellular insults. Assembly of these types of inflammasomes involves multimerization of the receptor (purple), which initiates filament formation of the adaptor protein ASC (green). ASC filaments act as activation platforms for caspase- 1(blue). In the noncanonical pathway, LPS is directly bound by caspase- 11(yellow), resulting in its activation. caspase- 1and caspase- which results release of the GSDMDNterm fragment. GSDMDNtermforms a large pore in the plasma membrane. Pore formation results in rapid loss of membrane integrity, the dissipation of the electrochemical gradient, and ultimately in cell death. The EMBO Journal Vol35|N o online: July 14, 2016 56 ResultsThe identification of GSDMD as an essential mediator of pyropto- sis has shed light on the possible functions of other gasdermin family members in programmed cell death. All gasdermins(GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, and GSDMD in humans; GSDMA1-3,GSDMC1-4, and mice) are composed of a distinctN-terminal and C-terminal domain (Tanaka et al, 2013), a feature shared by the extended gasdermin family members DFNA5 andDFNB59 (deafness, autosomal-dominant 5/autosomal-recessive gasdermin family members is intrinsically 2007; Op de Beeck et al, 2011; Shi et al, 2015). Given the func- tional and sequence similarity between gasdermin N-terminaldomains, it is not surprising that all gasdermins induce membranepermeability pores and subsequent cell death (Ding et al, 2016). Structural studies of GSDMD and other gasdermin family membersin their full-length and membrane inserted forms as well as thestoichiometry of these pores will thus remain of high interest.Furthermore, it remains to be shown whether several gasderminsmight cooperate in pore formation, given that caspase-1-dependentcell death does not solely rely on GSDMD (Kayagaki et al, 2015). Finally, to fully understand this emerging group of cell death effec-tors, it will be necessary to define how other gasdermin familymembers are activated and to identify the physiological context inwhich they induce cell death.

The puro-mycin resistance cassette was replaced by an EGFP by standardcloning procedures yielding pRetroX TetONE-eGFP. GSDMD pRetroXTetONE-eGFP by standard cloning procedures. Anti-GSDMD andanti-GAPDH antibodies were (both were from Cell Signaling Technologies (all at 1:1,000). HEK293T cells were seeded in 96-well plates (30,000cells per well) 1 day prior to transfection. Cells were subsequentlytransfected with 300 ng of plasmid DNA and 3 \u00d7(wt/vol) linear PEI (polyethylenimine). Twenty-four post-transfection cells were treatedas indicated in the respective figures. Generation of stable cell lines For complementation of Gsdmd KOcell lines (Dick et al, 2016), human Gsdmd was HeLa cell with a hygromycin resistance I104N mutant was generated using the Q5 site-directed mutage-nesis kit (NEB). To produce lentiviral particles, 1 \u00d710 6HEK239T cells were transfected with the 2 lg lentiviral plasmid, 2 lg psPax2, and 0.4 lg VSV-G for 6 hrs. Medium was exchanged, and lentiviral particles were collected 24 h later. Gsdmd -deficient immortalized macrophages were spin-infected with these particles, cells were selected with Hygromycin (500 lg/ml, invivogen) for 7 days. Selected cells were used for experiments. Macrophage infection Immortalized macrophages were seeded the day before the experi- ment (30,000 cells per well of a 96-well plate, 1.5 \u00d710 6cells per well of a 6-well plate). S. typhimurium (SL1344) was grown overnight in Luria broth (LB) medium. On the day of experiment,bacteria were subcultured 1:40 in LB and grown for 4 h to logarith-mic phase to induce SPI-1 expression. Cells were washed once withPBS and infected at an MOI of 50 with S. typhimurium diluted in OptiMEM. LDH and IL-1 brelease was determined as described in the respective manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates and super-natants were prepared for Western blot and analyzed by SDS -PAGE as described previously (Broz et al, 2012). Subcellular fractionation and membrane extraction About 1.5 \u00d710 7million immortalized macrophages were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture-treated dishes the day before the experiment. The next day, cells were left either uninfected or infected with log-phase S. Typhimurium at a MOI of 50 for 10 and 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. Cells were washed three times with homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris,10 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA, 7.5 mM MgCl 2, 250 mM sucrose), scraped, and homogenized using a syringe equipped with a (30 strokes) lysate). Samples were centrifuged for700 gfor 5 min; supernatants were transferred to a new tube and centrifuged the same way again. Combined pellets yielded the P0.7fraction, while the remaining supernatant yielded the S0.7 fraction.Pellets were washed twice with gfor was transferred to new tube and centrifuged thesame way again. Pellets (P10) were combined, washed twice withhomogenization buffer, and resuspended in SOL buffer (50 mMTris-HCl pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton min; was trans- ferred to a new tube and centrifuged the same way again. Pelletswere combined, washed again twice, and resuspended in SOL buffer(P150). The supernatants were analyzed as S150. Protein concentra-tion of every sample was determined by BCA, and equal amountswere analyzed by SDS -PAGE. For extraction of membrane fractions, cells were infected for 15 min with log-phase S. typhimurium , homogenized as described above, and membrane preparation andextraction were performed as described in Gatfield and Pieters (2000).

Single amino acid point mutation I104N was generated by QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All plas-mids were verified sequencing. The protein construct wastransformed in BL21 (DE3) E. coli strains, and the protein was expressed by growing the cultures at 37 \u00b0Ct oa nO D 600of 0.7 and by inducing with 0.5 mM IPTG overnight at 18 \u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellet was resuspended in20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole, 20 mMMgCl 2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5 mM TCEP, 0.1 mM protease inhibitor, and DNase I. The resuspended cells were disrupted by high-pressuremicrofluidization and centrifuged at 30,000 gat 4\u00b0C for 45 min. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at room temperature withpre-equilibrated Ni-NTA affinity resin (Thermo Scientific) and thenpassed through a column for gravity flow purification. The columnwas washed with 20 column volumes of resuspension buffercontaining 15 mM imidazole, and the fusion protein was elutedwith 3 column volumes of the same buffer with 250 mM imidazole.SUMO-tag cleavage was achieved by addition of ULP1 protease tothe solution and subsequent dialysis overnight at 4 \u00b0C against 20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM TCEP. GSDMD was elutedfrom a second round of purification through pre-equilibratedNi-NTA affinity resin. The protein was further purified by Hi-trapQion-exchange and a Superdex 75 gel filtration column (GE Health-care) pre-equilibrated with 20 mM Tris buffer pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl,0.5 mM TCEP. Purified GSDMD was frozen in small aliquots inliquid N 2. Human caspase-1, caspase-3, and caspase-8 were cloned into pET22 expression vectors, expressed as inclusion bodies inE. coli , and refolded as previously described (Ramage et al, 1995). Briefly, inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8M urea, and proteinwas refolded by rapid dilution; during which the enzymes auto-activated. A gel filtration column was run to purify the final product,and the concentration of active enzyme determined by active sitetitration. Liposome preparation The polar lipid extract derived from E. coli, total lipid extract derived from porcine brain, and DMPC were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster AL, USA). Chloroform lipid solutions ata concentration of 25 mg ml /C01were gently dried in a glass tube into a thin film under nitrogen flow and placed under vacuum overnightto further evaporate any residual solvent. The lipid layers were thatrehydrated in 1 ml of 50 mM HEPES buffer, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5under continuous shaking at 50 \u00b0C for 2 h. The lipid dispersions were subjected to 10 freeze -thaw cycles, and the resultant lipo- somes were extruded 20 through form large unilamellar vesicles (LUV). The meansize diameter of the liposomes was by dynamic light scatter-ing (DLS). To prepare dye-filled LUVs, the dry lipid film washydrated with 0.5 ml of 50 mM HEPES buffer, 50 mM NaCl,70 mM 6-carboxyfluorescein, 5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5) of extra-vesicular dye was achieved by a purification stepthrough a PD-10 column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with50 mM HEPES buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 7.5. FD-40, and liposomes were washed twice byultracentrifugation 4 \u00b0C for 20 min at 100,000 gand thenresuspended in 0.5 ml of the same isotonic solution. All liposomeswere stored at 4 \u00b0C and used within 24 h. Liposome leakage assay Membrane leakage experiments were performed FD-20, FD-40, and FD-150-filled liposomes composed ofpolar lipid extract derived from E. coli and total lipid extract derived from porcine brain .The samples were initially prepared by diluting 40 mM total lipid concentration in 100 ll solution of 50 mM HEPES buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM TCEP, pH 7.5 supplemented with dif-ferent aliquots of a 2.6 lM GSDMD stock solution. The NaCl concentration in the reaction buffer outside the LUV was optimizedto preserve caspase-1 activity and to minimize the dye release dueto the osmotic pressure exerted by the dye on the membranebilayer. To initiate the cleavage of GSDMD and the consequent poreformation reaction, different amounts of caspase-1 from a 12 lM stock solution were added to 100 ll of premixed LUV-GSDMD solu- tion. The membrane leakage was detected by measuring the time-course increase in fluorescence resulting from the dye dilution andsubsequent dequenching upon membrane pore formation. Theexperiments were carried out in a Corning 384-well non-bindingsurface plate, and the fluorescence was continuously recorded for2 h at 10-s intervals using a Biotek Synergy 2 plate reader withexcitation and emission wavelengths at 492 and 520 nm,respectively. At each time point, the percentage of dye release wascalculated as: Dye release \u00bc\u00f0I/C0I 0\u00de=\u00f0Imax/C0I0\u00de where Iis the emission intensity of the sample, I0is the emission intensity from an experiment with the liposome solution only (neg-ative control), and I maxis the emission intensity from an experiment with added Triton X-100 to the liposome solution (positive control). Gel-shift assays Recombinant GSDMD was incubated with different caspases for the indicated time period in a reaction vessel in caspase activity bufferof 100 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1%CHAPS, lM GSDMD. Reactions were quenched with 6xSDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS -PAGE. For cross-linking experiments, 2 mM DSS (ThermoFisher) were added to the reaction,and protein was cross-linked for 30 min before quenching thereaction. Thermofluor assay To monitor GSDMD thermal stability, the protein was incubated with the fluorescent dye Sypro orange and the thermal shift assaywas conducted in the CFX96 Real Time Detection System (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Solutions of 2 llo f2 lM GSDMD, 8 llo f 5\u00d7Sypro orange, 10 ll solution of screened condition were loaded to a 96-well plate. The plate was heated from 10 to 90 \u00b0C with a heating rate of 0.5 \u00b0C min /C01. The fluorescence intensity was measured with excitation and emission wave lengths of 490 and530 nm, respectively. EMBO Journal used to visualize GSDMD-mediated pore liposome surfaces.

The E. coli polar lipids and the extruding equipment used for liposome preparation were purchasedfrom Avanti Polar Lipids. The liposomes were stored at /C080\u00b0Ci n buffer solution (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.25). After incu-bation with 1 lM mM GSDMD and 0.2 lM caspase-1 for 90 min at 37\u00b0C in buffer solution (50 mM NaCl, 100 mM Hepes, 5 mM TCEP, pH 7.4), the liposomes were adsorbed onto freshly cleaved mica inbuffer solution (50 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) (Muller et al, 1997). After an adsorption time of 30 min, the sample was washedseveral times with the AFM imaging buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mMHepes, pH 7.8) to remove weakly adsorbed protein. Buffer solutionswere freshly made using nanopure water (18.2 M cm /C01) and pro- analysis ( >98.5%) purity grade reagents from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck. Each experimental condition characterized by AFM wasreproduced at least three times. Liposomes made from E. coli polar lipids incubated in buffer solution but in the absence of GSDMDshowed no arc-, slit- or ring-like structures when (FD-based using a Nanoscope Multimode 8 (Bruker, Santa Barbara, USA) operated in the PeakForce Tapping mode. TheAFM was equipped with a 120-l m piezoelectric scanner and fluid cell. AFM cantilevers used (BioLever mini BL-AC40, OlympusCorporation, Tokyo, Japan) had a nominal spring constant of0.1 N m /C01, a resonance frequency of /C25110 kHz in liquid and sharp- ened silicon tip with a nominal radius of 8 -10 nm. The FD-based AFM topographs were recorded in AFM imaging buffer (150 mMNaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8) and at room temperature as described(Pfreundschuh et al, 2014). The maximum force applied to image the samples was 70 pN, and the oscillation frequency and oscilla-tion amplitude of the cantilever were set to 2 kHz and 40 nm,respectively. The AFM was placed inside a home-built temperaturecontrolled acoustic isolation box. For data analysis, we took unpro-cessed AFM topographs. Diameters of ring-like GSDMD oligomerswere measured from the highest protruding rim. Heights of GSDMDarcs, slits, and rings were measured from their highest protrudingfeature relative to the surface of the lipid membrane. GSDMD oligo-mers were classified to having formed transmembrane pores if theinside of the pore was at least 3.5 nm deeper compared to thesurface of the surrounding lipid membrane.

Rosalie Heilig generated 61 ResultsAbstract Gasdermin-D is a new pore forming protein that is proteolytic processed and actiavted by inflammatory caspases. These caspases, caspase-1/11 in mice and caspase-1/-4/-5 in humans, are activated within canonical or non-canonical inflammasomes upon detection of host- or pathogen derived danger signals. Gasdermin-D pores target the cellular plasma membrane, disrupt the electrochemical gradient and thereby induce a lytic, inflammatory type of cell death referred to as pyroptosis, which involves the release of cytosolic content and pro- inflammatory cytokines like IL-1b and IL-18. Here we find that calcium influx through Gasdermin-D pores serves a signal for cells to repair damaged membrane areas and therefore delay or even prevent pyroptosis. We show that sensing of intracellular calcium ions is necessary for recruitment of the ESCRT-III machinery to the plasma membrane during pyroptosis. Inhibition of the ESCRT-III machinery strongly enhances pyroptosis in both human and murine cells and it enhances cytokine secretion in response to canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activators. Our results therefore not only attribute an anti-inflammatory role to membrane repair by the ESCRT-III system but also provide insight in general survival mechanisms during pyroptosis. Main text Introduction Pyroptosis is a necrotic type of cell death initiated by inflammatory caspases ( 1). These caspases are activated within macromolecular signalling known as inflammasomes ( 2). Canonical inflammasomes activate caspase-1 in both human and mouse cells and are assembled by cytoplasmic sensors - Pyrin and members of the PYHIN or the NLR (NOD-like receptor) family - that detect diverse pathogen- and host-derived danger signals. A 'non-canonical inflammasome' has been identified as well and shown to be assembled by the binding of the bacterial cell-wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to caspase-4, -5 in humans or caspase-11 in mice ( 2). All inflammatory caspases share the ability to induce pyroptotic cell death. Caspase-1 however is unique as it can also process the pro-forms of interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18 into their mature, bioactive forms. Pyroptosis is characterised by a rounding of the nucleus, membrane blebbing and ballooning, cell swelling and ultimately results in cell lysis and the release of cytoplasmic content ( 3-5). Two landmark studies recently identified Gasdermin D (GSDMD), a member of the ill- characterized gasdermin protein family, as the sole executor of pyroptosis ( 6, 7). GSDMD is a 53 kDa protein that contains distinct N- and C-terminal domains connected by a linker. Inflammatory caspases cleave GSDMD at a conserved cleavage site within this linker, thus 62 Resultsliberating the N- terminal domain (GSDMDNT) from an inhibitory interaction with the C- term (GSDMDCT), and allowing the N-terminal part to induce pyroptosis ( 6, 7). Studies by us and others showed that GSDMDNT targets cellular membranes, among them the plasma membrane, and that it forms large pores with an internal diameter of 10-16 nm in liposomal membranes ( membrane by GSDMDNT pores dissipates the electrochemical gradient across the membrane ( 5), leading to the inability to maintain osmotic balance and to stabilize cell volume. This ultimately causes uncontrolled water influx, swelling and cell lysis. These findings however also raise the question if activation of inflammatory caspases always results in cell death or if cells feature mechanisms by which they can completely prevent or at least delay cell death. Indeed, several groups have reported that caspase-1 activation can result in pyroptosis- independent cytokine release, depending on stimulus or cell type ( 12-15). Interestingly, damage of the plasma membrane does not necessarily result in death in all cases and muscle fibers for example repair large mechanical injuries in their plasma membrane in a Ca2+ dependent manner( 16-18). Early studies postulated that this involves the fusion of large intracellular membrane patches to the site of injury, yet how these fusion events can mechanistically restore a functional lipid bi-layer could not be explained ( 19, 20 ). Later studies showed that stable trans- membrane pores, as assembled by bacterial pore forming toxins (PFTs) like Streptolysin O (SLO), are removed in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and proposed two mutually non-exclusive models. One mechanism involves the exocytosis of lysosomal acidic sphingomyelinase (ASM) at the site of injury, resulting in plasma membrane remodelling and subsequent endocytosis of damaged membrane parts ( 21). The other mechanism involves the shedding of damaged plasma membrane parts in form of ectosomes that are formed by the ESCRT machinery( 22, 23). Both mechanisms are dependent on Ca2+ influx at the site of injury, confirming early observations that membrane repair by many cell types is dependent on extracellular calcium( 24). ESCRT -mediated plasma membrane repair was mainly characterized in response to laser-induced damage, but recently Gong et al. demonstrated that the ESCRT machinery prevents premature cell death during necroptosis, therefore allowing the cells to produce more pro-inflammatory cytokines and signal to neighbouring cells( 25). In this study, we investigated if pyroptosis is an unavoidable consequence of inflammasome activation, or if cells have the ability to delay or prevent pyroptosis. We find that upon non- canonical inflammasome activation a sub-population of cells resists pyroptosis, and that this requires the detection of Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, pyroptosis induction leads to the 63 Resultstranslocation of the ESCRT machinery to the plasma-membrane in a Ca2+-dependent manner, where the ESCRT components partially co- localize with GSDMDNT. Inactivation of the ESCRT machinery by expression of dominant-negative proteins resulted in highly enhanced pyroptotic cell death and cytokine release in a number of different cell types and in response to activators of both the canonical and non-canonical inflammasomes. Titration of inflammasome stimuli showed that an active ESCRT machinery was necessary for survival at sublytic levels of inflammasome activation. In conclusion, our findings indicate that membrane repair by the ESCRT machinery represents a universal mechanism how cells limit or even prevent cell death in response to inflammasome activation. Results Ca2+ chelation enhances cell death after non-canonical inflammasome activation In most cell types the activation of canonical or non-canonical inflammasomes results in incomplete lethality. Yet if the surviving cells fail to receive the stimulus or actively avoid cell death has not been examined so far. To investigate this question, we transfected primed bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) with LPS and monitored the disruption of the electrochemical gradient using the Ca2+ probe Fluo-8 and loss of membrane integrity (e.g. lysis) by propidium iodide (PI) staining in real-time. As expected we found that within 120 minutes post LPS transfection up to 50% of cells displayed strong PI staining ( Fig. 1A ). Single cell analysis showed that PI influx was preceded by a marked increase in Fluo-8 signal intensity that peaked immediately before cells lost membrane integrity and became PIhigh (Fig. 1B-C, Movie 1). Macrophages from Casp11- /- or Gsdmd- /- mice did not show an increase in Fluo-8 levels, nor did they acquire PI staining ( Fig. 1C, S1A, Movie 1 ), confirming that the Ca2+ and PI influx was dependent on activation of the non-canonical pathway and the pyroptosis executor GSDMD. When examining the 40-50% cells that did not exhibiting strong Ca2+ influx (Fluo-8 increase) ( Fig. 1A ), we unexpectedly found that these cells also displayed a gradual increase in intracellular PI staining ( Fig. 1D and S1B ). The intensity of this PI signal was much lower than what could be observed in cells that completely lost membrane integrity, and only reached 1/10 of the signal 1.5 hours post LPS transfection. This low-level PI influx was however not due to plasma membrane leakage of PI into the cells, since it required stimulation by LPS transfection ( Fig. 1D ) (see Material and Methods section for calculation details), and was not observed in LPS transfected Casp11- /- or Gsdmd- /- cells ( Fig. 1C and S1B ). Altogether this analysis indicated that, depending on time point and amount of transfected LPS, GSDMDNT-induced pore formation leads to rapid 64 Resultsrise in intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in a majority of BMDMs, indicating a loss of the electrochemical gradient shorty before complete rupture of the plasma membrane. However, these data also show that a sizeable subset of LPS transfected BMDMs can by some means restore membrane integrity after GSDMD activation, thus acquiring PI staining gradually without apparent loss of the electrochemical gradient. Since Ca2+ signalling controls cellular membrane repair mechanisms ( 16), we hypothesized that Ca2+ influx through the GSDMD pore serves indicates membrane permeabilization and that this initiates the repair of the affected plasma membrane area. Treatment wi th BAPTA - AM, a chelator of intracellular Ca2+ ions, has been widely used to study Ca2+-dependent membrane repair ( 21, 24). BMDMs were therefore pre-loaded with BAPTA-AM and transfected with LPS to test how the sensing of intracellular Ca2+ affects the level or speed of pyroptosis induction. BAPTA treatment increased the level of Lactate Dehydrogenase (a measure of cell death/lysis) release from LPS transfected WT BMDMs in manner ( Fig. 1E ). Importantly, BAPTA treatment did not result in spontaneous LDH release, since LDH levels were not significantly altered in Casp11-/- BMDMs ( Fig. 1E ), thus confirming that the observed increase in cell death was specific to detecting Ca2+ influx. Ca2+ chelation robustly increased and accelerated cell death over a range of transfected LPS concentrations as shown by titration experiments ( Fig. S1C ). The most striking effects of BAPTA treatment were observed at very low levels of LPS transfection, as cells transfected in medium were able to cope with caspase-11 activation and did not release LDH, while cells unable to detect Ca2+ influx failed to survive sub-lytic inflammasome activation and showed significant levels of cell death ( Fig. S1C ). Since Ca2+ chelation could increase the activity of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway by either enhancing the levels of LPS transfection, caspase-11 oligomerization or caspase-11 activity, we assessed the level of GSDMD processing as a proxy for altered levels of non-canonical inflammasome activation. Immortalized BMDMs expressing HA-tagged mouse GSDMD were transfected with different amounts of LPS in the presence or absence of BAPTA -AM, and the generation of the N-terminal p30 GSDMD fragment was assayed by immunoblotting. Fig. 1F ), suggesting that Ca2+ chelation did not modulate the assembly of the non-canonical inflammasome or caspase-11 activation, but acted downstream of GSDMD activation. We next asked if the non-canonical inflammasome in human cells responds similarly to chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by examining HeLa cells Typhimurium ( S. typhimurium ). Deficiency results in an instable 65 ResultsSalmonella containing vacuole and entry of the bacteria into the cytosol, where LPS is detected by caspase-4 (NLRC4 is not present in HeLa cells)( 26, 27). We observed a similar increase in LDH release upon treatment with BAPTA-AM compared to cells infected in medium ( Fig. 1G ), confirming the data obtained with primary mouse BMDMs. Ca2+ chelation did also not increase the levels of GSDMD processing in HeLa cells expressing FLAG -tagged human GSDMD ( Fig. Ca2+ does not affect inflammasome assembly, caspase activation or GSDMD processing per se, but specifically enhances the levels of cell lysis, most likely by masking the signal (Ca2+ influx) necessary to initiate the repair of GSDMD-damaged plasma membrane regions. ESCRT components translocate to the plasma membrane during pyroptosis Ca2+ influx engages membrane repair programs, among them the shedding of damaged membrane areas in form of ectosomes that are formed with help of the ESCRT machinery (22, 23). To investigate if the ESCRT machinery is activated during upon pyroptosis induction, we made use of HeLa cells stably expressing near endogenous levels of CHMP4-GFP ( 28). Uninfected cells showed homogenous distribution of CHMP4-GFP in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, whereas upon activation of the non- canonical inflammasome by sifA S. typhimurium infection, CHMP4-GFP formed multiple distinct puncta at the cell periphery, presumably at the plasma membrane ( Fig. 2A, arrowheads ). Similar puncta could also be observed in cells treated with pore forming toxin perforin ( Fig. 2A ), which has been shown to form pores in the plasma membrane ( 24). Furthermore, expression of GSDMDNT was sufficient to induce CHMP4-GFP puncta formation, supporting the notion that CHMP4- GFP aggregation was triggered by plasma membrane damage ( Fig. 2A ). To confirm that CHMP4-GFP translocated to the plasma membrane upon GSDMD pore formation, we used the lipophilic probe FM 4-64FX that exhibits low fluorescence in water but fluoresces intensely upon binding the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. Upon induction of GSDMDNT expression CHMP4 -GFP puncta 2B ), confirming that during pyroptosis the ESCRT machinery is activated and localizes to the plasma membrane. Live cell microscopy of CHMP4-GFP puncta in cells induced for GSDMDNT expression further showed that CHMP4-GFP was dynamic, quickly assembling and disassembling at the cell periphery before cells lost membrane integrity ( Fig. 2C, Movie 2). Interestingly, we also observed that in pyroptotic CHMP4- GFP HeLa cells the cytosolic 66 ResultsGFP signal was lost while peripheral GFP puncta were retained, suggesting that CHMP4- GFP complexes remain strongly associated with the plasma membrane after cell death ( Fig 2D). The translocation of ESCRTIII components to the plasma membrane in response to laser-induced damage or MLKL-induced damage requires the detection of Ca2+ influx into the cytosol and is effectively blocked by incubation in Ca2+ free medium or chelators like EDTA or BAPTA- AM ( 22, 25). We therefore assessed next if chelation of Ca2+ ions treated using medium, medium supplemented with BAPTA-AM or Ca2+-free medium (containing 2 mM EDTA). Cells were then either left untreated (control) or treated with Dox to induce GSDMDNT expression and subsequent pyroptosis, before quantifying the number with in Ca2+-free medium did not affect CHMP4 -GFP localization in control cells, but significantly reduced the percentage of cells displaying CHMP4-GFP speckles after GSDMDNT induction ( Fig. 2E-F ). This finding demonstrated that detection of Ca2+ influx in response to GSDMD pore formation is necessary for the translocation of CHMP4-GFP and presumably other ESCRTIII components to the plasma membrane and suggested that the increase in cell death upon Ca2+ chelation (Fig. 1, S1) is linked to an inability to engage ESCRT-mediated membrane repair. While clathrin, COPI and COPII coat promote the budding and pinching-off of vesicles towards the cytosol, the ESCRT machinery is the only mechanism known so far that allows vesicles to bud and pinch-off away from the cytosol ( 29, 30). This feature is necessary for example to form multi-vesicular bodies (MVBs), to release ectosomes or as part of viral budding, which incidentally involves the hijacking of the ESCRT machinery by the virus (31). In the context of ESCRT-mediated membrane repair these buds are thought to contain damaged plasma membrane areas. During necroptosis, which is delayed by ESCRT-mediated membrane repair, Annexin-V-positive bubbles appear at the plasma membrane( 25), which might be ESCRT-induced structures, although their size (up to 500 nm in diameter) is larger than what has been reported for viral buds (approx. 100 nm in diameter). Examination of LPS transfected iBMDMs by electron microscopy revealed multiple vesicles budding off from the plasma membrane towards the extracellular space ( Fig. 2G ), while no such features could be found in untreated cells ( Fig. S2B ). These vesicles ranged in size between 50 and 100 nm often had a distinct neck region, reminiscent of ESCRT-induced HIV buds( 31). In conclusion, our results showed that during GSDMDNT-induced pyroptosis cells respond by 67 Resultsinitiating the formation of ectosomes and the recruitment of the ESCRT machinery to the plasma membrane, and that ESCRT recruitment requires Ca2+ signalling. Thus, they support the notion that ESCRT-mediated membrane repair is engaged in response to GSDMD pore formation at the plasma membrane. Expression of dominant-negative ESCRT-III components enhances pyroptosis The ESCRT-III machinery is essential for cellular homeostasis ( 29, 32), a nd consequently knock-out or prolonged knock-down results in toxicity, for example due to uncontrolled basal levels of necroptosis( 25). Previous studies have however shown that expression of dominant negative ESCRT- III proteins, such as truncated CHMP3 that lacks the regulatory C-terminal domain (CHMP31-179) or ATP-binding deficient VPS4a (VPS4aE228Q) leads to deregulated activation and impaired recycling of other ESCRT components, therefore effectively depleting the cytosolic pool of functional ESCRT components ( 22). To assess if an ESCRT-dependent membrane repair program regulates pyroptosis, we stably transduced HeLa with Dox-inducible wildtype versions (CHMP31-179 or VPS4aE228Q) (Fig. S3A ). To assess the toxicity of these proteins we induced their expression for up to 24 hours. Immunoblot analysis showed that following Dox treatment WT and dominant-negative VPS4a and CHMP3 were expressed to comparable levels at all time points examined ( Fig. S3B). Expression of VPS4aWT or CHMP3WT did not affect cell viability during the period examined, while both VPS4aE228Q or CHMP31-179 induced moderate cell death after 20 hours ( Fig. S3C ). This cell death, which is most likely caused by necroptosis ( 25), was even more prominent at 24 hours post induction ( Fig. S3C ). We therefore restricted the following experiments to the early period post induction (i.e. all experiments were terminated not later than 15 hours post Dox treatment) during which expression of dominant-negative proteins did not lead to increased frequency of dead cells nor changes in cell density or cell morphology, compared to cells expressing the WT protein. We next tested if induction of dominant-negative and dominant- negative VPS4a for 6 hours showed that while VPS4aWT localized evenly throughout the cytoplasm, VPS4aE228Q aggregated inside the cell ( Fig. 3A). A similar pattern was observed with CHMP31-179, but required induction for 12 hours (Fig. 3A ). These findings were in line with published observations ( 33, 34), and indicated that the dominant-negative proteins arrested the disassembly of the ESCRT machinery and thus depleted the cells of active ESCRT components. 68 ResultsWe then assessed how depletion of active ESCRT components affected pyroptosis after non- canonical inflammasome activation in human and mouse cells. Expression of wildtype and dominant- negative VPS4a or CHMP3 was induced in the HeLa cells prior to infection with sifA S. typhimurium to activate the non-canonical inflammasome. Consistent with an important role of the ESCRT machinery in controlling pyroptotic cell death in human cells, we observed that cell death was strongly enhanced in cells expressing either VPS4E228Q or CHMP31-179 compared to WT controls, independently of the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (Fig 3B ). Immunoblotting for GSDMD processing demonstrated that inactivation of the ESCRT machinery through VPS4E228Q and CHMP31-179 expression did not change GSDMD processing even though it strongly enhanced cell death, suggesting that the ESCRT mediated membrane repair acts downstream of caspase-4 and GSDMD activation ( Fig 3C ).As cells of the myeloid lineage respond to pathogen infection by activation of inflammasome, we tested if ESCRT dependent membrane repair has a role during pyroptosis in mouse macrophages by generating immortalized BMDMs stably Dox-inducible human VPS4WT or VPS4E228Q. The transgenic iBMDM lines were simultaneously treated for 6 hours with LPS to induce caspase-11 expression and doxycycline to induce expression of wildtype or dominant-negative VPS4a before transfection of LPS. Consistent with the results obtained in HeLa cells, we found that the wildtype protein localized evenly throughout cells, whereas the dominant-negative VPS4a clustered in iBMDMs ( Fig. S3D ). LPS transfection of these lines showed that expression of VPS4aE228Q more than doubled the levels of membrane permeabilization as judged by PI staining ( Fig. 3D-E ) as well as 3F ) compared to iBMDMs expressing VPS4aWT. These increased levels of cell death required the activation of the non-canonical inflammasome and G SDMD, as Casp11- /- or iBMDMs expressing VPS4aWT or VPS4aE228Q only displayed basal levels of cell death when transfected with LPS ( Fig. 3G ). Immunoblots confirmed equal expression levels of VPS4aWT or VPS4aE228Q in all genotypes (Fig. 3H ).Next, we asked how ESCRT- III-mediated inhibition of cell death impacts on the release of mature IL-1 cytokines. Since GSDMD pore formation and subsequent efflux of K+ is necessary to activate NLRP3 and caspase-1 in the non-canonical pathway ( 35), ESCRT i nactivation could enhance cytokine release by enhancing the degree of K+ efflux due to prolonged GSDMD pore formation. Alternatively, accelerated cell lysis as a result of ESCRT inactivation could 69 Resultsalso limit the time available for NLRP3 activation and IL-1b maturation and thus reduce the amount of mature cytokine that are released from dying cells. LPS-primed immortalized BMDMs expressing VPS4aE228Q or VPS4aWT were thus transfected with LPS and supernatants analysed for the release of mature IL-1b by ELISA. Significantly higher levels of mature IL-1b were found in the supernatants of VPS4aE228Q expressing BMDMs compared to VPS4aWT expressing controls ( Fig. 3I ), which was entirely dependent on the presence of caspase-11 and GSDMD ( Fig. 3J). These findings are consistent with a model in which enhanced or prolonged GSDMD pore formation triggers increased K+ efflux and thus increased NLRP3 inflammasome activation, which was confirmed by the enhanced levels of processed, activated caspase-1 that were found in cells expressing VPS4aE228Q ( Fig. 3K ). Furthermore, inhibition of treatment or high extracellular K+ processing was slightly enhanced in cells expressing VPS4aE228Q compared to iBMDMs expressing VPS4aWT ( Fig. 3M ). We postulated that this increase of GSDMD processing could be a consequence of enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation ( Fig. 3J-L ), and thus caspase-1-dependent. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that GSDMD processing was unchanged between VPS4aE228Q and VPS4aWT expressing iBMDMs in the presence of MCC950 ( Fig. 3M ), confirming that in the non-canonical pathway ESCRT mediated regulation of pyroptosis is downstream of caspase-11 activation and GSDMD processing. Taken together these data show that inactivating the ESCRT machinery strongly enhances pyroptotic cell death in human and mouse cells following non-canonical inflammasome activation, thus suggesting that ESCRT-dependent membrane repair is a conserved mechanism that counteracts cell death by reducing plasma membrane damage caused by GSDMD pore formation. ESCRT controls cell death after canonical inflammasome activation Given the strong effects of ESCRT inhibition of pyroptosis induced by the non-canonical inflammasome, we asked if cell death triggered by the canonical inflammasome pathway, which involves the activation of caspase-1 in human and mouse cells, is also negatively regulated by ESCRT-mediated membrane repair. We first examined the effect of Ca2+ chelation on pyroptosis induction after activation of the AIM2 Mouse BMDMs were primed, treated with BAPTA-AM and transfected with different concentrations of poly(dA:dT) (synthetic DNA), an AIM2 ligand. As observed for Resultstransfection ( Fig. 4A ). BAPTA treatment did not lead to spontaneous cell death, since BMDMs deficient in Asc, a critical adaptor protein of canonical inflammasomes, showed only basal levels of pyroptosis. Assessing caspase-1 activation by immunoblotting revealed that the generation of the caspase-1 p20 subunit was not enhanced by Ca2+ chelation, suggesting that BAPTA treatment did not enhance steps upstream of caspase- 1 activation ( Fig. 4B ). These experiments ( 4B ) were conducted in BMDMs deficient in Nlrp3 to exclude effects of secondary NLRP3 activation via GSDMD pore induced potassium efflux, and importantly, enhancement of cell death by calcium depletion was independent of NLRP3 ( Fig S4A ). Given the effects of Ca2+ sensing on canonical inflammasome activation, we next examined the effects of depleting the ESCRT machinery on cell death transduced with Dox-inducible VPS4aWT or VPS4aE228Q were treated with Dox to induce protein expression, primed and infected with different MOIs of log-phase S. typhimurium to activate the canonical NLRC4 inflammasome ( 36). Consistent with our previous findings, we observed an enhancement of cell death in cells expressing dominant-negative VPS4a despite unaltered levels of ASC speck formation or GSDMD processing ( Fig. 4C-D and Fig. S4B ). This cell death was specific to the activation of the NLRC4 inflammasome, since it was not observed in Gsdmd- /- BMDMs ( Fig. S4C ). Increased cell death as a consequence of ESCRT inactivation also led to a slight increase in the release of mature IL-1b ( Fig. 4C ), suggesting that E SCRT -mediated membrane repair negatively regulates the levels of cytokines that are released in a GSDMD-dependent manner. Although our experiments suggested that ESCRT-mediated membrane repair restricts caspase-1- induced cell death, the effects were much smaller compared to non-canonical inflammasome activation. A possible explanation could be that oligomerization of the receptors and the adaptor ASC, which have been proposed to amplify the signal generated by few active receptors ( 37, 38), produces too much active caspase-1 within a short period of time thereby quickly overwhelming membrane repair mechanisms. To investigate this possibility, we created HEK293T cells stably transduced with chemically dimerizable caspase-1 (DmrB-Casp1 allows to induce the oligomerization of DmrB and thus the activation of caspase-1 in a controlled manner and without the need for receptor or adaptor proteins. DmrB-Casp1 HEK293T were co- transfected with human GSDMD and Dox-inducible constructs for wildtype and dominant-negative CHMP3/VPS4a proteins, respectively, and protein expression was induced with 71 ResultsDox for 16 hours. Remarkably and unlike to what we had observed in HeLa cells, none of the dominant-negative proteins induced changes in cell appearance or induced cell death after 16 hours of expression in HEK 293T cells, most likely because of absence of a functional RIPK3/MLKL signalling axis( 39) (Fig. S4D ). We next examined the effects of ESCRT inactivation on caspase-1-induced pyroptosis by measuring PI influx over a period of 1.5 hours post B/B homodimerizer addition. PI influx increased faster in cells expressing dominant- negative ESCRT proteins compared to cells expressing wild-type ESCRT proteins (Fig. S4E ), confirming that the ESCRT machinery restricts pyroptosis after caspase- 1 activation. Nevertheless, even cells with an active membrane repair reached high levels of cell death after 2.5 hours, indicating that even chemically activated caspase-1 eventually overwhelms membrane repair mechanisms. Treatment with washout compound allows to quickly disrupt B/B homodimerizer-induced DmrB oligomers and might thus allow to terminate DmrB- Casp -1 activity and create a limited amount of GSDMD pores. To test this, we activated DmrB-caspase-1 by B/B homodimerizer addition for 30 minutes in GSDMD expressing DmrB- Casp -1 HEK293T cells, before addition of a 50-fold excess of washout compound. Disruption of caspase- 1 activity by washout compound treatment resulted in a significant reduction of cell death levels, while PI levels in cells that were only treated with B/B homodimerizer continued to rise (Fig. 4E ). While washout compound treatment decreased cell death levels in cells expressing VPS4aWT and VPS4aE228Q, it however also strongly enhanced the difference in cell death levels between cells expressing VPS4aWT and VPS4aE228Q, indicating that an active ESCRT machinery plays a more important role in conditions where caspase-1 is activated at low level or for a limited time (compare Fig 4E to Fig. S4 E). Titration of the B/B homodimerizer followed by washout treatment revealed that across a variety of concentrations, disruption of the ESCRT machinery by expression of dominant-negative proteins enhanced cell death strongly ( Fig 4F , Fig. S4F ), while processing of GSDMD by caspase-1 was not altered by expression of dominant-negative proteins compared to their wildtype counterparts ( Fig 4G ). Importantly, inhibition of cell in Dmrb- Casp -1 HEK293T cells only when GSDMD was expressed, that ESCRT-mediated membrane repair negatively regulates GSDMD-induced pyroptosis ( Fig. S4G). To confirm the impact repair on cytokine secretion in DmrB- Casp1 HEK293T we with pro- IL-1b (DmrB-Casp1 pro- IL-1b HEK293T). These cells GSDMD and 72 Resultsdominant-negative CHMP3 and VPS4a respectively. Stimulation of these cells with B/B homodimerizer followed by treatment with washout compound resulted in the release of mature IL-1b, which was significantly higher in cells expressing CHMP31-179 or VPS4aE228Q ( Fig 4H and 4I ). Enhanced levels of IL-1b release correlated with enhanced cell death, consistent with the essential role of GSDMD pores in IL-1b release (Heilig et al. unpublished data, ( 40). Overall these experiments show that ESCRT mediated membrane repair not only dampens GSDMD pore mediated cell death but at the same time negatively affects IL -1b secretion following canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation, in a variety of cell lines and systems. Discussion Since the 1950 it has been known that various cells feature the ability to rapidly reseal damaged plasma membrane areas by mechanisms that strictly depends on the detection of Ca2+ influx. How membrane repair is initiated and executed has however only emerged recently, and two mutually non-exclusive mechanisms have been identified, relying either on lysosome exocytosis of ASM followed by internalization of damaged membrane regions or the removal of damaged membrane in form of ectosomes generated by the ESCRT machinery. While early reports suggested that such membrane repair is mainly regulating plasma membrane damage as a result of PFT or mechanical damage, it has now become evident that the ESCRT machinery also regulates host-signalling pathways, for example by enhancing survival of cells undergoing necroptosis and therefore increasing the potential to signal to neighbouring cells ( 25). We now demonstrate that a Ca2+-dependent membrane repair by the ESCRT system negatively regulates GSDMD-induced pyroptosis in human and mouse cells, and in response to a variety of activators. We propose that the function of ESCRT in the context of pyroptosis is to remove GSDMD pores from the plasma membrane by removing permeabilized areas in form of ectosomes. We can however not exclude that another function of the ESCRT complex, for example in vesicular trafficking, restricts pyroptosis as well, nor do our findings exclude the possibility that other parallel mechanisms restrict pyroptotic cell death. ESCRT inhibition enhances IL-1b release after both canonical and non- canonical inflammasome activation and allows cell survival at sub-lytic levels of inflammasome stimulation, suggesting that membrane repair might be essential to protect the organism against low level spontaneous or uncontrolled inflammasome activation that could result in systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, due to the essential nature of the ESCRT machinery deletion of 73 ResultsESCRT- III components are lethal, thus making it impossible to investigate the role of membrane repair in vivo. Our results demonstrate the importance of calcium mediated membrane repair downstream of inflammasome assembly, caspase activation and GSDMD processing. It is however well established that membrane damage through pore forming toxins is an upstream signal that drives NLRP3 inflammasome assembly ( 41). Thus, it will be interesting to determine if and how membrane repair programs regulate NLRP3 activation triggered by pore forming toxins or during pathogen infection. recently it has also been demonstrated that disruption of the nuclear envelope results in release of DNA into the cytosol and the activation of the AIM2 inflammasome ( 42). As the ESCRT machinery mediates resealing of the nuclear envelope during upon mechanical stress ( 43, 44 ) or during the reformation of the nuclear envelop during telophase, it will be interesting to examine if inactivation of ESCRT-III results in higher levels of AIM2 activity during these events. The release or secretion of mature IL-1b has debated for decades and several mechanisms were proposed. release within ectosomes or exosomes has been proposed to be one mechanism for how IL-1b leaves the cells ( 45), and indeed several publications have reported that pyroptotic cells release microvesicles ( 46-48), even though the nature and source of these vesicles was unknown. Our findings thus provide an explanation why microvesicle shedding can be observed during inflammasome activation and implicate the ESCRT machinery in this process. It will be interesting to investigate if microvesicles released from pyroptotic cells contain mature GSDMD and possibly other factors know to be release during pyroptosis. Moreover, the function of these vesicles prior to pyroptosis or for cell to cell communication or as means of communication to more distant sites in the host remains to be elucidated. Our findings could also have important implications for the mechanism of IL-1b release itself. While IL- 1b release has been shown to be GSDMD-dependent in macrophages and other cell types ( 6, 7), we have observed that GSDMD-dependent IL-1b release also happens if lysis is blocked (Heilig and Broz, EJI, in press) ( 40). While it is possible that IL-1b is released directly through the GSDMD pore under these circumstances, an alternative explanation would be that GSDMD pore formation triggers ESCRT activity that continuously releases IL -1b packed in ectosomes. Such a mechanism might also be mediating IL-1b relea se at sublytic levels of inflammasome activation (see Fig. 4) or in several systems that have been reported to result in cell death-independent IL-1b release, among these neutrophils (13), OxPAPC-treated NAG-elicited NLRP3 inflammasome 74 Results(14). If lL -1b release in these systems requires GSDMD and the ESCRT machinery, and if it proceed through microvesicle shedding should be subject of further research. Our results provide a conceptual insight into how the different cell types mentioned above resist pyroptosis and that regulation of inflammasome signalling is not necessarily dependent on expression and activation of components of the inflammasome but on the integration of inflammasome pathways with different host signalling pathways. These pathways may confer permanent resistance or transient persistence of cells against GSDMD mediated pyroptosis. It is important to note that plasma membrane repair in particular does not exclusively rely on the ESCRT system but can be mediated by ASM mediated endocytosis of pores. Both pathways are not mutually exclusive, however if they are connected yet needs to be determined. In addition, it was reported that caspase-1 activity induces the activation Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Proteins (SR EBPs) ( 49), which can promote cell survival upon toxin challenge possibly by facilitating membrane repair. Therefore, further research is necessary to define membrane repair programs, cell type specific differences and if the engagement of the different programs changes the fate of cells subjected to inflammasome activation.

Nucleic acids and their derivatives are detected by RIG-I-like receptors, cGAS, DAI and RNA polymerases, which results in the induction of type I interferons via the signaling molecule STING and the kinase TBK1 (refs. 1-3). Cytosolic forma-tion through AIM2, a member of the PYHIN family of receptors 4-7. AIM2 binds double-stranded DNA through HIN-200 the inflammasome ASC. ASC rapidly oligomer-izes to form a ASC speck' , which activates caspase-1. Active caspase-1 promotes the maturation and release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin 1 B (IL-1B) and IL-18. In addition, it induces pyroptosis, a lytic form of cell death that restricts pathogen replication. The AIM2 inflammasome mediates the recognition of DNA viruses as well as that of various Gram-negative and Gram-positive ) 8-14. Notably, several studies have shown that activation of AIM2 by these bacteria requires bacteriolysis and the subse-quent release of bacterial chromosomal DNA into the cytosol 10,12,15 . However, whether the bacteriolysis is accidental or is an active, host-directed mechanism has remained unclear. The activation of AIM2 via the transfection of synthetic DNA or during infection with a DNA virus is independent of signaling via Toll-like receptors or interferons 9,13,16. In contrast, the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida requires the production of type I interferons, which are induced as a result of the recognition of an as-yet-undefined F. novicida -derived nucleic acid ligand in the the activation of AIM2 inflammasomes in F. novicida -infected cells requires signaling through STING and the transcription factor IRF3 (refs. 9,10,17). It has been speculated that interferon signaling is necessary to increase cellular AIM2 for the detection of F. novicida DNA 9, yet interferon-mediated induction of AIM2 is contested, and even small amounts of transfected DNA efficiently trigger activation of AIM2 in an interferon-independent manner 9. Therefore, it is likely that one or several interferon-inducible factor(s) is (are) required for efficient activation of AIM2 during bacterial infection. Type I and type II interferons are potent cytokines that exert anti-microbial effects through the induction of a broad transcrip-tional program involving ~2,000 genes, the 'interferon-stimulated genes' (ISGs), of which remain uncharacterized. 1Focal Area Infection Biology, Biozentrum, University of Basel, Basel, of Medical Microbiology and Hospital Hygiene, Heinrich-Heine-University Duesseldorf, Duesseldorf, Germany. 5Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. 6These authors contributed equally to this work.

AIM2 is critical for host defense against DNA viruses and bacteria that replicate in the cytosol, such as Francisella tularensis subspecies novicida (F. novicida activation of AIM2 by F. novicida requires bacteriolysis, yet whether this process is accidental or is a host-driven immunological mechanism has remained unclear. By screening nearly 500 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) through the use of small interfering RNA (siRNA), we identified guanylate-binding proteins GBP2 and GBP5 as key activators of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida . We confirmed their prominent role in vitro and in a mouse model of tularemia. Mechanistically, these two GBPs targeted cytosolic F. novicida and promoted bacteriolysis. Thus, in addition to their role in host defense against vacuolar pathogens, GBPs also facilitate the presentation of ligands by directly attacking cytosolic bacteria.ARTICLESnpg \u00a9 201\u0018 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved. 97 ResultsNATURE IMMUNOLOGY VOLUME 16 NUMBER 5 MAY 2015 477Prominent among the products of these ISGs are several families of interferon-inducible GTPases, such as the immunity- related to (GBPs) 21,22. GBPs are conserved among vertebrates, with 11 GBPs in mice and 7 in humans, and exert anti-microbial effects on intracellular bacteria and protozoa 23. GBP1 restrict to the pathogen-containing vac-uole (PCV) recruited onto the Toxoplasma para- sitophorous vacuole25, and most are also required for restricting the replication of Toxoplasma gondii23,26-28. In addition, GBPs encoded by genes on mouse chromosome 3 promote recognition of the vacu-olar, Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella typhimurium by the innate immune system by destabilizing its PCV , which leads to egress of the bacteria into the cytosol and subsequent detection of its lipopolysac-charide (LPS) by the caspase-11 inflammasome 29. In this study we found that GBPs encoded by genes on mouse chromosome 3 were a key factor for the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novic- ida. In particular, GBP2 and GBP5 controlled the activation of AIM2 by targeting cytosolic F. novicida and inducing lysis of these bacte- ria by an as-yet-uncharacterized mechanism. We demonstrated that GBP-deficient mice were unable to control infection with F. novicida in vivo . Together our data reveal a function for GBPs during micro- bial infection, in that GBPs promoted bacteriolysis in the cytosol and the exposure of bacterial DNA to cytosolic sensors of the innate immune system. RESULTS AIM2 activation during F. novicida infection requires interferons F. novicida is a facultative intracellular Gram-negative bacterium that avoids phagosomal degradation in phagocytes by escaping into the cytosol, a process that requires the Francisella pathogenicity island (FPI). After escaping from the phagosome, F. novicida replicates in the cytosol but also triggers AIM2-dependent activation (refs. macrophages F. novicida resulted in cell tosis; measured by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) and the release of IL-1 B dependent on AIM2, ASC and caspase-1, while a mutant lacking the FPI ( $FPI) did not activate the inflammasome (Fig. 1a). STING is linked to the activation of AIM2 during infec- tion with F. novicida mutation of alleles ' StingGt/Gt ' here)) had considerable attenuation of their ability to induce expression of type I interferons and activation of the AIM2 inflammasome upon infection with F. novicida 5 (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Consistent with a role for type I interferons in activation of the AIM2 inflamma-some 17,19, macrophages from mice deficient in receptor for B or Stat1 , encodes the transcription factor STAT1, displayed significantly less pyroptosis and release of IL-1 B when infected with F. novicida than did their wild-type counterparts ( Fig. 1c). To further confirm that activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida depended on signaling via type I interferons, we assessed whether exogenous interferons were able to restore inflammasome activation in STING-deficient BMDMs. As expected, IFN- B restored cell death and the release of cytokines in Sting Gt/Gt BMDMs ( Fig. 1d ). The addition of IFN-G restored cell death and the release of cytokines in both StingGt/Gt BMDMs and Ifnar1/ BMDMs (Fig. 1d), which indicated a require- ment for a general interferon signature. The induction of Aim2 mRNA could explain the considerable dependence on type I interferons and signaling via STAT1 during infection with F. novicida 10. However, activation of the AIM2 inflam- masome by transfection of DNA or infection with DNA viruses is independent of interferon signaling 9,13,16 .

The transfection of large amounts of DNA might overload the system and render it independent of interferon signaling. To rule out this possibility, we 'titrated down' the amount of transfected DNA. The activation of AIM2 remained interferon independent even upon the transfection of small quantities of DNA (Fig. 1e ). These results indicated that basal AIM2 was sufficient to initiate inflammasome activation 9,13. Indeed, we observed only weak induction of Aim2 mRNA following infection with F. novicida (Supplementary Fig. 1b ). Finally, we confirmed that F. novicida genomic DNA was as stimu- latory as synthetic DNA by transfecting increasing amounts of each into macrophages that had been primed with the synthetic lipopeptide Pam 3CSK 4 to induce expression of pro-IL-1 B. Both types of DNA triggered similar cell death and release of IL-1 B (Fig. 1f ), which excluded the possibility that F. novicida DNA had properties that allowed it to evade recognition by AIM2. Together these results indicated that one (or several) IFN- B- or IFN- G-inducible gene(s) was (were) needed to activate AIM2 specifically during bacterial infection. Identification of the GBP family by genetic screening To identify ISGs encoding products involved in F. novicida -mediated activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, we screened BMDMs by RNA-mediated interference with small interfering RNA (siRNA). We selected 443 genes with at least twofold higher expression in F. novicida -infected wild-type macrophages than in F. novicida - infected Ifnar1 / macrophages17 and selected 40 additional genes on the basis of published reports9,10,17,18 (data not shown and Supplementary Table 1 ). At 48 h after transfection of siRNA specific for those genes, we infected macrophages with F. novicida and moni- tored inflammasome activation by measuring the release of IL-1 B and incorporation of propidium iodide (as a measure of cell death). Knockdown of most of the 483 genes did not substantially affect the release of IL-1 B or cell death ( Fig. 2a ). In contrast, knockdown of Gbp2 or Gbp5 resulted in much less F. novicida -mediated release of IL-1 B and macrophage death than that of cells treated with nontargeting siRNA, while knockdown of other GBP-encoding genes showed effect ( Fig. 2a ). Gbp2 and Gbp5 had the GBP-encoding genes in macrophages and were sub-stantially and specifically induced upon infection with wild-type F. novicida in a STING- and IFNAR-dependent manner Toll-like receptor ( Fig. and Supplementary Fig. 1c -e). We confirmed by RT-PCR the efficiency of siRNA- mediated knockdown of GBP-encoding genes expressed during infection with F. novicida (Supplementary Fig. 2a ). We next confirmed the screening results by knocking down all 11 mouse GBP-encoding genes individually an d measuring cell death and IL-1 B release ( Fig. 2c). Knockdown of Gbp2 and Gbp5 specifically decreased the F. novicida -mediated release of IL-1 B and cell death, as assessed by two different techniques ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2b ). In conclusion, our screening approach identified GBP2 and GBP5 as two possible ISG products that controlled the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida . AIM2 activation requires GBP-encoding genes on chromosome 3To confirm our screening data, we obtained macrophages from wild-type mice, mice deficient in both caspase-1 and caspase-11 (Casp1 /Casp4/; called ' Casp1/Casp11/' here) or mice that lack the locus on chromosome 3 encoding GBP1, (called naive or primed macrophages with F. novicida . Consistent with defective activation of the AIM2 inflammasome, Gbpchr3-deficient BMDMs displayed a significant reduction in cell death and cytokine release and had a diminished abundance of processed caspase-1 p20 compared with that of their wild-type counterparts, even though their expression of pro-caspase-1, ASC and AIM2 protein was similar to that of wild-type cells ( Fig. 3a, b and Supplementary Fig. 3a ). Measuring the incorpo- ration of propidium iodide in real time following infection showed that Gbp chr3-deficient BMDMs died with delayed kinetics compared with that of wild-type cells and similar to that of Ifnar1/ BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 3b ).

Cytosolic DNA triggered LDH release to a similar extent in both groups of cells, even when the amount of transfected DNA was cells also similarly to the transfection of purified F. novicida genomic DNA ( Fig. 3d). Thus, GBPs were not required in the context of DNA transfection, which suggested that they functioned upstream of AIM2-mediated DNA detection. GBP2 and GBP5 direct parallel pathways of AIM2 activation Since our screening data suggested that mainly GBP2 and GBP5 were required for the activation of AIM2 Gbp5/ activation of the AIM2 inflammasome. Gbp2/ BMDMs displayed less death BMDMs ( Gbp5/ BMDMs attenuated inflammasome activation when infected with F. novicida relative to that of their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 4a ,b). Deficiency in Gbp2 or Gbp5 did not affect cell death in response to DNA transfection, even when we used very small amounts of DNA ( Fig. 4c ). To determine if expression of GBP2 or GBP5 could restore activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in Ifnar1 / cells, we retrovirally transduced macrophages with constructs expressing GBP2 or GBP5 or with an empty vector (control) and infected them with F. novicida . Such ectopic expression was not able to complement the deficiency in inflammasome activation ( Supplementary Fig. 4a -c), which suggested that other products of ISGs might be required for the function of GBP2 and GBP5, in line with data showing that GBPs are active and correctly targeted only in the context of the interferon response 25. Single deficiency in Gbp2 or Gbp5 did not reduce the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida as much as Gbpchr3 deficiency did ( Fig. 4a ,b), which suggested that GBP2 and GBP5 promoted acti- vation of AIM2 through To investigate whether GBP2 and GBP5 acted sequentially or in parallel, we knocked down Gbp2 expression in wild-type, Gbp2 / and Gbp5/ BMDMs (control Figure 3 Macrophages from Gbpchr3-deficient mice have deficient activation of AIM2 in response to F. novicida .

Knockdown of Gbp2 reduced cell death and release of IL-1 B in wild-type BMDMs but not in 4d), which demonstrated that in Gbp5 -deficient cells, GBP2 was still active and was able to pro- mote activation of AIM2. Consistent with that, knockdown of Gbp5 reduced activation of inflammasome Gbp2/ BMDMs ( Fig. interferon-inducible GTPases GBP2 and GBP5 controlled non-redundant, parallel pathways that activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida . Escape of F. novicida from phagosomes is GBP independent Since cytosolic localization of F. novicida is required for the activa- tion of AIM2 and since GBPs promote the destabilization of phago-somes and/or pathogen-containing vacuoles of protozoan parasites or bacteria 23,27,29 , we speculated that GBPs might facilitate the escape of F. novicida from phagosomes. We used a phagosome-protection assay29,30 based on selective permeabilization of the plasma membrane with digitonin to assay the escape of F. novicida from phagosomes. As reported before30, we observed that 90-95% of wild-type F. novicida escaped from phagosomes within a few hours of infection, but thisfrequency was similar for wild-type BMDMs and Gbp chr3-deficient BMDMs various time ( Fig. 5a ). In contrast, $FPI F. novicida remained in the phagosome (data not shown). F. novicida is naturally resistant to B-lactam antibiotics and secrete the B-lactamase FTN_1072. Taking advantage of this, we developed an alternative assay to detect cytosolic bacteria based on cleavage of the FRET (F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer) reporter probe CCF4 by FTN_1072, which leads to a loss of FRET activity 31,32 (Supplementary Fig. 5 ). We preloaded wild-type, Gbp2/ and Gbpchr3-deficient BMDMs with CCF4-AM, the membrane-permeable form of the reporter, and subsequently infected the cells with wild-type F. novicida , an FTN_1072-deficient strain (the B-lactamase mutant $bla) or the $FPI mutant. We observed no difference among wild-type, Gbp2 / or Gbpchr3-deficient BMDMs in terms of FRET activity after infection with wild-type F. novicida (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 5 ). The $FPI and $bla mutant strains did not prod uce any significant FRET signals, similar to the signaling of uninfected macrophages ( Supplementary Fig. 5). Thus, we concluded that GBPs did not control the activation of AIM2 by promoting the escape of F. novicida from phagosomes but that they were active after F. novicida reached the cytosol. This was consist- ent with our data showing that in unprimed cells, F. novicida -induced expression of GBP-encoding mRNA wa s dependent on the FPI and on the escape from phagosomes ( Fig. 2b ) and that cytosolic recognition for interferon ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). GBPs promote cytosolic lysis of F. novicida To identify the mechanism by which GBPs controlled the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida , we investigated the subcellular localization of GBPs in infected ce lls. GBPs are known to co-localize with vacuolar pathogens such as S. bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin and T. gondii , consistent with the ability of GBPs to recruit anti-microbial effector mechanisms to the pathogen and to destabilize PCVs 24,27,29 . We observed that both GBP2 and targeted to intracellular F. novicida (Fig. 6a ). Closer examination of GBP-positive F. novicida revealed that GBPs localized to different spots close to or onto the surface of the bacterium (data not shown). However, it was unclear if GBPs targeted the bacterium directly or targeted remnants of the host membrane (i.e., lysed phagosomes) or another closely associated membrane compartment. Since the irregular shape of GBP-positive bacteria suggested that they were lysed, we next determined if wild-type and Gbp chr3- deficient cells differed in the abunda intracellular F. novicida . Viable and lysed intracellular bacteria be quantified on the basis of propidium iodide staining, since intact bacteria remain protected from the influx of propidium iodide 33 (Fig. 6b). We tested the assay bacteria in wild-type BMDMs infected with wild-type F. novicida or an F. novicida mutant in which the gene encoding the outer membrane protein FopA is deleted ( $fopA ) and thus it has lower membrane stability that results in increasedintracellular lysis and hyperactivation of the AIM2 inflammasome 15. We significantly larger amounts of propidium $fopA F. novicida than wild-type F. novicida (Fig. 6c), which confirmed the validity of our assay. We next compared the frequency of lysed bacteria in wild-type and Gbp chr3-deficient macrophages. The Gbpchr3-deficient BMDMs had a significantly lower frequency of lysed bacteria (positive for staining with antibodies to F. novicida and propidium iodide) (23% on average) than average) ( Fig. 6c). as the DNA released from Immunofluorescence analysis revealed mostly irreg- F. vicinity of ASC specks ( Fig. 6d ). These bacteria released DNA and were often also positive for GBPstaining ( Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Consistent with that, the number of ASC Fig. 6e ). In conclusion, these findings indicated that GBPs associated with cytosolic F. novicida and, by an as-yet-undefined mechanism, induced lysis of the bacterium, which resulted in DNA release and detection by the cytosolic DNA sensor AIM2, followed by oligomerization of ASC.

Cell-autonomous immunity, on the other hand, relies on cell-intrinsic mechanisms to restrict bacterial growth without the need for killing the host cell 21. To determine whether GBPs restricted F. novicida growth through cell-autonomous mechanisms or inflammasome-dependent mechanisms, we protein (GFP) and used flow cytometry to quantify infected cells (more than two bacteria per cell, our specific fluorescence-detection threshold) among the live cell population. We observed a significantly higher percentage of live infected Aim2 /, Gbpchr3-deficient and Ifnar1/ BMDMs than live infected wild- type BMDMs ( Fig. 7a ). This suggested that deficiency in Ifnar1 or Gbpchr3, similar to deficiency in Aim2 , resulted in a reduction in inflammasome-mediated killing of host cells upon infection. Cell-autonomous growth restriction is an interferon-induced mechanism that is at least partially independent of inflammasome-mediated cell death 35,36. Therefore, we next determined if Gbpchr3- deficient BMDMs and Ifnar1 -deficient BMDMs also had a defect in restricting intracellular bacterial replication.

Wild-type macrophages efficiently controlled intracellular replication, but Aim2/ BMDMs contained large numbers of intracellular F. novicida (30 or more per cell) (Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 7a ,b), consistent with a loss of inflammasome-mediated killing of host cells. Bacterial loads were even higher in Gbpchr3-deficient or Ifnar1 -deficient BMDMs, with many cells containing up to 100 bacteria ( Fig. 7b and Supplementary Fig. 7a ,b). The production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide is a potent cell-intrinsic anti-microbial mechanism that can also be activated in an interferon-dependent manner. GBP7 has been shown to recruit subunits of the NADPH oxidase to intracellular L. 24, and inducible nitric oxide synthase can restrict bacterial growth in a cell-intrinsic manner21. However, deficiency in these mechanisms achieved through the use of BMDMs deficient in both inducible nitric oxide synthase and Nox2 did not significantly alter bacteriolysis and inflammasome activation after infection with F. novicida (P = 0.3081, P = 0.2786 and P = 0.0529; Supplementary Fig. 8a ,b). Overall, these data indicated that GBPs encoded by the locus on chromosome 3 participated in growth restriction in two ways: directly, by promoting the lysis of intracellular bacteria by an as-yet-unknown mechanism; and indi-rectly, by promoting the inflammasome-mediated killing of host cells, thereby removing the intracellular replicative niche of F. novicida . GBPs replication in vivo AIM2, ASC and caspase-1 control the replication of F. novicida in vivo in mice 9,10,37. Since GBPs are required for inflammasome activation in vitro , we investigated whether these proteins also have a physiologi- cal role in host defense. We infected age- units of wild-type F. novicida strain U112 and measured the bacterial burden in the liver and spleen at 2 d after infection. As published before 37, Casp1/Casp11/ mice displayed a significantly higher bacterial burden in the liver and spleen than that of wild-type mice ( Fig. 8a). Similarly, Gbp2 / and Gbpchr3-deficient mice showed higher bacterial counts than wild- type mice, similar to or even higher than those of Casp1/Casp11/ mice ( Fig. 8a vivo we detected concentration of IL-18 in Casp1/Casp11/, Gbp2/ and Gbpchr3-deficient mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 8b). To further assess the effects of GBP deficiency in vivo , we analyzed survival. Within 4 d of infection, all Casp1 /Casp11/, Gbp2/ and Gbpchr3-deficient mice died, while most wild-type mice survived until the end of the experiment (day 10) (Fig. 8c). These results confirmed the relevance of our in vitro data and demonstrated that GBPs encoded by the locus on chromosome 3 were important for inflammasome activation and host defense against F. novicida in vivo . DISCUSSIONSince the activation of AIM2 during infection with the cytosolic path-ogen F. novicida required interferon signaling, we investigated the role of the products of ISGs in this process. Our results showed that the interferon-inducible GTPases GBP2 and GBP5 promoted F. novicida - mediated activation of the AIM2 inflammasome but were dispensa-ble for the activation of AIM2 upon transfection of DNA. Members of the GBP family take part in interferon-induced cell-autonomous immunity and are known to induce disruption of the PCVs of vacuolar bacteria and parasites 23,27,29. However, the cytosolic localization of F. novicida was similar in wild-type and Gbpchr3-deficient cells, which indicated that GBPs must have been involved later during infection, after the bacteria had entered the cytosol. This was consistent with results showing that the escape from phagosomes is an interferon-independent process 36 and that cytosolic localization of F. novicida is a prerequisite for interferon induction17. Since the activation of AIM2 during infection with F. novicida or L. monocytogenes is known to require cytosolic bacteriolysis12,15, we investigated whether GBPs controlled the bacteriolysis and replication of F. novicida in the cytosol. Significantly fewer lysed and more overall F. novicida were present in cells deficient in GBP-encoding genes or Ifnar1 than in wild-type cells, which indicated that GBPs were required for interferon-mediated cell-autonomous immunity to the pathogen. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that in addition to their known function in destabilizing PCVs, GBPs can also promote the lysis of cytosolic bacteria. GBPs are also critical for the cytosolic recognition of LPS and for activation of the caspase-11 inflammasome pathway. In this context, they act by promoting the release of vacuolar S. typhimurium into the cytosol or by promoting activation of caspase-11 during infection with L. pneumophila 29,38. At present, no model fully explains how GBPs restrict pathogen growth during infection with microbes or protozoa Figure 8 GBPs control host defense against F. novicida in vivo .

It is, however, conceivable that the membrane-destabilizing activity of GBPs in com-bination with their bacteriolytic activity could not only result in the entry of bacteria into the cytosol but also release microbe-associated molecular patterns (for example, LPS and DNA) directly. Such a model might explain their effect on both the caspase-11 pathway 38 and the AIM2 pathway in response to cytosolic bacteria. Thus, bacteriolysis would also release F. novicida LPS into the cytosol. However, since F. novicida LPS is tetra-acylated, it does not trigger caspase-11 activation 39. Conversely, we would expect GBPs to lyse cytosolic Salmonella or Legionella , which would result in activation of AIM2. But in this case, activation of AIM2 is most probably masked by a high degree of caspase-11-dependent cell death and cytokine release. GBP-mediated bacteriolysis might also be expected to release DNA and amplify the production of type I interferons via STING. Notably, what triggers initial STING signaling and the induction of GBP-encoding genes during infection with F. novicida is still unde- fined, but two possibilities exist. One is the direct activation of STING via a secreted bacterial cyclic nucleotide, analogous to infection with L. monocytogenes 40, and another is activation of the DNA sensor cGAS by F. novicida DNA and subsequent production of the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP41,42. Lysis of F. novicida within the phagosome followed by translocation of its DNA into the cytosol could trigger interferon production 9. Alternatively, low levels of F. novicida extra- cellular DNA could reach the cytosol by sticking to the surface of the infecting bacteria, as suggested for infection with M. tuberculosis 43. Finally, small amounts of spontaneous bacteriolysis might occur in the host-cell cytosol. If DNA ind eed triggers initial STING-mediated production of interferons, it remains to be shown why it is insufficient to trigger activation of AIM2. Additional experiments are needed to determine the relative DNA-binding affinities of cGAS and AIM2 and how their signaling hierarchy is controlled. Our results have revealed an underappreciated, close connection between cell-autonomous immunity and recognition by the innate immune system. The attack of GBPs on PCVs or pathogens liberates microbe-associated molecular patterns and thus ensures subsequent immunological recognition of the pathogen, which explains the role of interferon signaling in the detection of bacterial DNA by AIM2 or LPS from vacuolar bacteria by the caspase-11 pathway 9,10,13,44,45 . Additional questions remain, such as how GBP targeting is regulated and how GBPs act mechanistically. Ectopic expression of GBP2 or GBP5 did not 'rescue' the inflammasome deficiency of Ifnar1 / cells, which suggests that other products of ISGs are necessary for proper targeting and activity of GBPs 24,25. Indeed, members of the IRGM family, a subclass of the immunity-related GTPases, can act as guanine- dissociation inhibitors and control the targeting of both immunity-related GTPases and GBPs to pathogen-containing vacuoles, yet the molecular mechanism of this is still unclear 46-49. Additional biochemi- cal studies are needed to define the mechanism of GBP targeting and action during bacterial infection and how this promotes the exposure of bacterial ligands to cytosolic recognition pathways.

Mice were bred in the animal facilities of the University of Basel or at the Plateau De Biologie Exp\u00e9rimentale De La Souris. Animal infection. All animal experiments were approved (license 2535, Kantonales Veterin\u00e4ramt Basel-Stadt and ENS_2012_061) and were guidelines (Tierschutz-Verordnung, Basel-Stadt and CECCAPP , Lyon) and the law (Tierschutz-Gesetz). Age- and sex-matched mice (8-10 weeks of age) were infected subcutaneously with 5 \u00d7 10 3 or 1.5 \u00d7 105 colony-forming units of stationary-phase wild-type F. novicida strain U112 in 50 Ml PBS. Mice were killed at the appropriate time point after infection. No randomization or 'blinding' of researchers to sample identity was used. Cell culture and infection. BMDMs were differentiated in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% mouse fibroblasts), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen) and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen). 1 d before infection, macrophages were seeded into 6-, 24- or 96-well plates at a density of 1.25 \u00d7 10 6, 2.5 \u00d7 105 or 5 \u00d7 104 cells per well. Where required, macrophages were pre-stimulated with Pam 3CSK 4 or infec- tion with F. novicida , bacteria were grown overnight at 37 \u00b0C with aeration in brain-heart-infusion medium or tryptic soy broth. The bacteria were added to the macrophages at a multiplicity of infection of 100 or the appropriate value. The plates were centrifuged for 15 min at 500 g to ensure similar adhesion of the bacteria to the cells and were incubated for 120 min at 37 \u00b0C. Next, cells were washed and fresh medium with 10 Mg/ml gentamycin (Invitrogen) was added to kill extracellular bacteria, then plates were incubated for the desired length of time. Transfection with poly(dA:dT) or poly(dG:dC) was done as described 29 or as indicated in the figures and legends ( Figs. 1 and 3). siRNA-mediated knockdown. Genes were knocked down with pools seeded into 24- or 96-well plates at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 or 3 \u00d7 104 cells per well. siRNA complexes were prepared at a concentration of 25 nM siRNA in GenMute Buffer according to the manufacturer's instruc-tions for forward knockdown (SignaGen laboratories). siRNA complexes were mixed with BMDM medium (described above) and were added onto the cells. After 22-48 h of gene knockdown, BMDMs were infected with F. novicida at a multiplicity of infection of 100:1 and were analyzed for inflammasome activa-tion as outlined below. siRNA pools targeted the following (numbers in parentheses (D-001206-14).siRNA screening. Knockdown of the 483 selected genes was performed as described above in the 36 central wells of 96-well plates; this included the nontargeting control siRNA and siRNA specific for Asc and Aim2 on each plate.

Ectopic expression of GBP2 and GBP5. Mouse Gbp2 and Gbp5 were cloned into the lentiviral plasmid TRIP iziE-SSFV-GFP with the following prim- ers and restriction enzymes (upper case indicates gene sequence; lower case indicates restriction site (underlined) and four bases flanking in the 5 293T human embryonic kidney cells and the transduction of primary BMDMs were performed by standard meth-ods. IFNAR1-deficient macrophages were transduced after 8 d of differentia-tion by spin-inoculation (1,500 g for 2 h at room temperature). Transduced macrophages were infected 48 h later. Transduction frequency was determined by flow cytometry based on GFP expression. Specific ectopic expression was checked by quantitative RT-PCR. Cytokine and LDH release measurement. IL-1B, measured with an Detection Kit (Clontech). To normalize for spontaneous lysis, the percentage of LDH release was calcu-lated as \u00d7 100. Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was done as described 29. Antibodies used were rat anti-mouse caspase-1 follows (all conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and all at a dilution mRNA quantification are in Supplementary Table 3 . Experiments were performed with an iCycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) with standard protocols.Statistical analysis. Prism 5.0a software (GraphPad Software) was used for statistical analysis of data. For evaluation of the differences between two groups (cell death, cytokine release, flow cytometry, colony-forming units and immunofluorescence-based counts), a two-tailed t-test was used. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used for comparison of the cell distribu-tion as determined by ImageStream microscopy in flow. P values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni correction approach. Animal experiments were evaluated with the Mann-Whitney or log-rank Cox-Mantel test.npg \u00a9 201\u0018 ResultsNATURE IMMUNOLOGY doi:10.1038/ni.3119Immunofluorescence. Macrophages were seeded on glass coverslips and were infected as described above. At the desired time points, cells were washed three times with PBS and were fixed for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C with 4% parafor-maldehyde. Following fixation, coverslips were washed, and the fixative was quenched for 10 min at room temperature with 0.1 M glycine. Coverslips were stained for 16 h at 4 \u00b0C with primary antibodies (identified below), then were washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the appropriate Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibodies (identified below) (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen), then were washed with PBS and mounted on glass slides with Vectashield conta ining DAPI (6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Vector F. novicida (1:1,000 dilution; a gift were as folllows (all at a dilution of 1:500 and all from Life Technologies): goat anti-rat coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (A11006), Alexa Fluor 568 (A11077) or Alexa Fluor 633 (A21094); goat anti-rabbit coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (A11008) or Alexa Fluor 568 (A10042); and goat anti-chicken coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (A11032), Alexa Fluor 568 (A11047) or Alexa Zeiss at a magnification of \u00d763 and vacuolar versus cytosolic bacteria, total intracellular bacteria or ASC specks were quantified as described in the figure legends. Phagosome protection assay. For quantification of cytoplasmic and vacuolar bacteria, macrophages were infected with GFP + F. novicida as described above. At the desired time point, cells were washed with KHM buffer (110 mM potassium acetate, 20 mM HEPES and 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.3), followed by incubation for 1 min in KHM buffer with 50 Mg/ml digitonin (Sigma). Cells were immediately washed three times with KHM buffer and then were stained for 12 min with Texas Red-coupled chicken antibody to F. novicida (identified above) in KHM buffer with 2% BSA. Cells were washed with PBS, then were fixed and analyzed by microscopy. Controls were included in every assay as described 29. Intracellular viability measurement. For measurement of the intracellu- lar lysis of F. novicida , we propidium iodide-staining method33. Infected BMDMs were incubated for 12 min at 37 \u00b0C with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated mouse antibody to F. novicida (identified above) and 2.6 MM propidium iodide (Sigma) in KHM buffer (described above) for label- ing of accessible cytosolic bacteria and compromised bacteria, respectively, in permeabilized cells. Cells were fixed and imaged as described above. CCF4 measurements. Quantification of escape from vacuoles with the B-lactamase-CCF4 assay was performed following manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies). Macrophages seeded onto non-treated plates were infected for 1 h as described above, washed and then incubated for 1 h at room temperature in CCF4 in the presence of 2.5 mM probenicid (Sigma). Live (propidium iodide-negative) cells were used for quantification of cells containing cytosolic F. novicida , with excitation at 405 nm (cleaved CCF4) or 510 nm (intact CCF4). Flow cytometry. For assessment of bacterial replication by flow cytometry, macrophages seeded onto untreated plates were infected as described above with GFP-expressing F. novicida strains. At 8 h after infection, cells were lifted with trypsin and were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACSCanto II cytometer (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were excluded on the basis of staining with propidium iodide. ImageStream flow cytometry. bacteria were fixed in 4% PFA and were analyzed on an ImageStream X Mark II (Amnis; EMD-Millipore) with Inspire software, with the extended depth- of-field function activated to increase the accuracy of spot counts. Images of single cells were analyzed with Ideas software (Amnis; EMD-Millipore) with the following steps (each step being confirmed by visualization of at least 20 single cells). Doublets and debris were excluded by morphological param-eters (aspect ratio and area in the brightfield channel). Defocused images were eliminated by the Gradient RMS function of the brightfield function. For spot counts and definition of the mean fluorescence of single bacterium, the specific GFP fluorescence signal was defined by application of a mask combining an intensity threshold and a spot to cell background ratio (peak) function. Automatic spot counts were performed with the mask described above. Cells containing a single spot (either a single bacterium or a tight cluster of several bacteria) were gated. The area of the specific signal was analyzed in single cells on the gated population. For the exclusion of bacterial clusters and quantification of the fluorescence of single bacterium, the mean fluorescence intensity was calculated on the GFP + signal covering an area of 1 o 0.5 M m2 in 1,599 cells. Bacteria in single cells were quantified by the automatic spot count function or their numbers were calculated based on the fluorescence of single bacterium. The quantification was identical for cells containing fewer than seven bacteria ( R 2 > 0.99). For higher intracellular burden, the spot-count function largely underestimated the number of bacteria per cell due to the difficulty to discriminate bacterial cluster. We thus relied on the specific fluorescence of the bacteria within the cells as defined by the mask described above and the calculated fluorescence value of single intracellular bacterium to quantify bacteria per cell. The mas k was applied to at least 10,000 images of single cells per sample to extract the specific fluorescence of the intracellular bacteria in single cells.npg \u00a9 201\u0018 Nature America, Inc.

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7:11929 www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1 109 ResultsDetection of pathogens by the innate immune system relies on germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize a variety of pathogen-derived molecules, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and host-derived danger signals, known as danger- associated molecular patterns1. Although most PRRs initiate transcriptional responses, such as the expression of cytokines2,3,a subset of cytosolic PRRs promote the assembly of inflammasome subsequent activation of the cysteine protease caspase-1 (refs 4,5). To date, only members of the NOD-like receptor (NLR) family, the PYHIN protein family and PYRIN were shown to assemble inflammasomes in response to different cytosolic PAMPs or danger-associated molecular patterns5,6. A unifying feature of all these receptors is either a pyrin domain(PYD) or a caspase recruitment domain (CARD), both of which belong to the death-fold domain superfamily. On the basis of the presence of these domains, the receptors can be classied as PYD- containing receptors (NLRP3: NLRP1: NLR family, PYD containing 1). After receptor activation and oligomerization, these domains recruit the adaptor protein ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and pro-caspase-1 into the complex through homotypic domain- domain interactions. Within the inflammasome, pro-caspase-1 is activated by dimerization and auto-proteolysis, and active hetero-tetramer is a pro-inflammatory cell death called pyroptosis 10. Pyroptosis is driven by the amino-terminal cleavage fragment of gasdermin-D, a protein cleaved bycaspase-1, and results in the lysis of the host cell and subsequent release of cytoplasmic content, among them processed IL-1 band IL-18 (refs 11,12). Recent studies have started to elucidate the role of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC13-15, a bipartite protein composed of a PYD and a CARD, also known as PYCARD16,17. ASC has previously been regarded as a simple adaptor proteinthat links PYD-containing receptors to the CARD-containing caspase-1, via homotypic PYD-PYD and CARD-CARD interactions18. However, its role appears to be more complex, as on receptor activation ASC also forms the so-called ASC speck,a macromolecular form of the inflammasome with of B1-2 mm19,20. Formation of the ASC speck is independent of but of ASC intolarge insoluble aggregates20,21. These ASC aggregates are stable and have even been shown to be released into the extracellularspace, after pyroptosis induction, where they can trigger prolonged inflammasome activation in phagocytic cells22,23. Analyses of stimulated emission depletion microscopy imagesand electron micrographs suggest an irregular, lamentous shape22,23. Consistently, we and others have shown that ASC oligomerizes into long helical laments via its PYD13-15. Despite the advances regarding the atomic structure of the ASC lament, whether the ASC speck is the functional unit of the inflammasome is unclear. Several inflammasome receptors (for example, NLRC4 and mouse Nlrp1b) contain a CARD instead of a PYD and are able to recruit caspase-1 even in the absence of ASC. Indeed, we and others have shown that ASC is not required for cell death induction by these receptors24-28. Nonetheless, activation of CARD-containing receptors results in ASC speckformation in wild-type (WT) cells, but how their CARD initiates ASC laments is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether ASC oligomerization itself is required for inflammasomesignalling. Previous mutagenesis studies of ASC could notaddress the role of ASC oligomerization in signalling, as they were based on overexpression of ASC mutants in HEK293 cells, which is prone to artefact generation and lacks the means to studythe effects on downstream signalling 13,29,30. Here we use retroviral expression of ASC mutants in Asc-decient immortalized mouse macrophages, to address the of ASC speck formation and the functional relevanceof ASC lament formation for inflammasome signalling. Our results reveal an architectural role for the ASCCARD, showing that it is required to link individual ASC laments towardsforming the dense ASC speck. Furthermore, we show that ASC bridging molecules are necessary to allow CARD-containing receptors the initiation of ASC lament formation. Finally, we use site-directed mutagenesis of the ASCPYD-ASCPYDinteraction interfaces to identify mutations that disrupt ASC lamentformation without affecting the interaction to receptor PYDs. Surprisingly, such ASC mutants are still able to initiate caspase-1- dependent gasdermin-D maturation and subsequent cell death, but lack the ability to form laments, to assemble ASC specks and to process IL-1 b, thus uncoupling the two major downstream signalling pathways. In conclusion, our data show that the ASCspeck has a function in inflammasome signalling and support a model in which the rapid oligomerization of ASC via its PYD creates a multitude of potential caspase-1 activation sites, thus serving as a signal amplication mechanism for inflammasome signalling. Results Distinct roles for the ASC PYDand ASCCARDin speck assembly . Although ASC is the main structural component of the ASC speck20,24, conflicting reports have implicated either the ASCPYD or the ASCCARDin speck assembly13,31,32. To address the role of the ASCPYDand the ASCCARDin speck formation and ASCFLcan result in aggregation even in the absence of activated receptor19,w e selected individual clonal lines that did not display anyautoactivation when unstimulated (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To test the functionality of these constructs, cells were primed with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and transfected with the synthetic DNA analogue in by the (LDH)) andIL-1brelease (measured by in immortalized WT macrophagecontrols (Fig. 1b). We also observed comparable levels of IL- 1b/-18 and caspase-1 processing and release by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 1b). In contrast, neither the ASC activation (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 1b).Similarly, expression of the individual domains did not restore inflammasome signalling in response to extracellular ATP, an NLRP3 activator35(Supplementary 1 (RIG-I) and pro-caspase-1 results in the formation of laments of varying length in different cell types and in vitro13,36-40. However, it is possible that such ASCPYDor ASCCARDlaments are overexpression artefacts, as ASCFL normally forms a distinct dense speck structure20. To assess the ability of ASCPYDand ASCCARDto form macromolecular assemblies, we examined the above described cell lines byARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11929 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11929 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 110 Resultsmicroscopy, following inflammasome stimulation. As expected, activation of AIM2 or NLRP3 induced the formation of perinuclear specks in cells expressing mCherry-tagged ASCFL (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1e,f). In line with the reportedability of ASC to form laments13,15, specks formed by ASCFL had a dense core with emanating laments (Fig. 1c). Instead offorming similarly dense specks, the ASCPYDassembled into laments on the engagement of NLRP3 or AIM2 (Fig. 1c). Ofnote, laments formed after NLRP3 or AIM2 activation differed in their appearance, possibly due to distinct modes of how NLR and PYHIN family members assemble complexes and initiate ASC laments13,41. Remarkably, these laments had varying lengths and widths, with some appearing clearly thicker than90 \u00c5, the reported diameter of an ASCPYDlament13,15. Unlike reported before, we observed that the ASCCARDwas not able to form macromolecular assemblies (Fig. 1c and SupplementaryFig. 1e,f). Taken together, these data suggest that although both domains of ASC are necessary for signalling, only theASCPYDforms laments on inflammasome activation. This is consistent with reports by us and others showing that full-lengthASC forms helical laments in vitro via the ASCPYD(refs 13,15), whereas the ASCCARDis exposed on the surface and not involved in ASC lament formation15. As straight laments are formed by ASCPYDand compact specks are formed by ASCFL, our data also suggest that the ASCCARDmust contribute signicantly to the macroscopic structure of the ASC speck. ASCCARDscondense ASCPYDlaments into ASC specks two mutations in surface-exposed residues of the ASCCARDthat abrogate interaction of the ASCCARDwith the pro-caspase-1CARD (ref. 31). As expected, Asc/C0//C0macrophages expressing ASCD130Ror ASCD134Rdid not activate caspase-1, release mature IL-1 bor undergo pyroptosis in response to DNA transfection or ATP treatment (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 2b-d). ASCD130Rand ASCD134Rformed long laments rather than dense ASC specks in response to AIM2and NLRP3 activation (Fig. 2c,d and Supplementary Fig. 2e,f), similar to the ASCPYDalone, thus supporting our hypothesis that a functional ASCCARDis required to assemble ASCPYD laments into a speck. To conrm that these mutations not only disrupt ASCCARD-pro-caspase-1CARDinteractions but also ASCCARD-ASCCARDinteractions, we expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP)-tagged ASCCARDin the only able to interact with WT ASC and not with ASCD130Ror ASCD134R, conrming that the two mutations blocked ASCCARD-ASCCARDinteraction (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h). If the ASCCARDorganizes ASC laments into dense specks, we speculated that increasing levels of ASCCARDmutants would disrupt specks formed by WT ASC, resulting in larger but less dense ASC specks. Therefore, we retrovirally transduced various endogenousASC) and measured median speck size the activation of AIM2 by poly(dA:dT) transfection or NLRP3 by Nigericin, a pore- toxin35. Indeed, increasing levels of ASCD130Rresulted in a signicant increase in ASC speck size (Fig. 2e,f). As expected,microscopy analysis of these large ASC specks showed that they were also less dense and had a lamentous nature (Fig. 2g). Taken together, these results support a model in which the ASC speck observed in WT cells is composed of individual ASC laments that are formed via their PYDs and cross-linked to each other via their CARDs (Supplementary Fig. 3a). NLRC4 oligomerizes ASC via a bridging ASC molecule inflammasome-forming receptors contain a PYD and initiate ASC laments directly by homotypic PYD-PYD interactions. Notable exceptions are NLRC4 and mouse Nlrp1b, which contain a CARD and thus might recruit and activate caspase-1 directly42,43. Nevertheless, ASC promotes caspase-1 observed activation, but how CARD-containing receptors initiateoligomerization of ASC is unknown. Theoretically, NLRC4 could ASC (i) NLRC4CARD- ASCCARDoligomerization, (ii) hetero- typic interaction between related LPS c Figure 1 | Both domains of ASC are required for signalling.

To determine which domain of ASC was necessary for ASC speck formation after NLRC4activation, we infected the above described cell lines harbouringthe single domains of ASC with published reports induced cell death, whereas efcient IL-1 and release required ASC (Fig. 3a). restored IL-1 brelease, but neither the ASCPYDnor ASCCARD alone were able to functionally restore inflammasome activation(Fig. 3a). We next analysed whether the ASCPYDor NLRC4 activation bymicroscopy. Although ASCFLformed specks, ASCPYDalone did not initiate laments following activation of NLRC4 (Fig. 3b,c),which was in contrast to what we had observed for PYD- containing receptors (Fig. 1c). In addition, cells expressingASC CARDalone did not form any specks or macromolecular laments, again suggesting that the ASCCARDin the endogenous setting is not able to form laments (Fig. 3b,c). These results exclude the possibilities that ASC specks form via CARD oligomerization after NLRC4 activation, or that a heterotypic NLRC4CARD-ASCPYDinteraction initiates ASC lament formation.

We also examined cells expressing ASCD130Rand ASCD134R mutants, which are defective for CARD-CARD interactions (Supplementary Fig. 2g,h (ref. 31)). As expected, expression of these mutants in Asc/C0//C0macrophages did not complement the release of mature IL-1 bafter NLRC4 activation (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, we did not observe the formation of laments or specks in cells expressing ASCD130Ror ASCD134R(Fig. 3e), conrming a functional ASCCARDfor ASC oligomerization by NLRC4. Finally, we also tested our notion that the ASCCARDis required to condense ASC laments into a speck in the context of NLRC4 activation. Primary WT C57BL/6BMDMs (containing endogenous of varying ratios of ASCD130Rand the speck diameter was measured on S.Typhimurium infection (Fig. 3f). The increase in speck size concurring with increasing concentra- tions of the ASCD130Rmutant indicated that also in the NLRC4 inflammasome the ASCCARDcondenses the ASC laments into the speck. In conclusion, our results suggested a triple functional role for ASCCARDin the NLRC4 inflammasome: ASC general architecture speck, wenext investigated signalling-competent inflammasome. Higher-order signalosomes were receptors, receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase promote signal ampli- cation and digital all-or-nothing responses 48, leading us to hypothesize that ASC oligomerization and lament formationmight have a similar function for inflammasome signalling. Within the ASCPYDlaments that form the backbone of ASC specks in human and murine cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a (refs 13,15)), individual ASCPYDsinteract interfaces, types (Fig. 4a). Mutations targeting these interfaces can abrogate ASC lament formation in vitro or in cell overexpression systems13,29,49. As these mutations also most probably abrogate the interaction between the receptorPYDand ASCPYD, and/or were only tested in an articial overexpression system, a deniteconrmation that ASC lament formation is required for inflammasome signalling is still missing50. Identication of mutations that abrogate ASC oligomerization but leaveASC-receptor interaction intact allowed us to characterize the role of ASC laments in inflammasome signalling. Therefore, we generated a number Cells (%)25 05101520LPS S.

Next, we assessed the effects of these mutations on ASC speck/lament formation on AIM2 activation by poly(dA:dT) transfection. Mutations interface I (that is, K21A, K26A, D48N and D51R) completely abrogated the lament formation as determined by microscopy (Fig. 4b upper panel and Supplementary Fig. 4e). This is consistent with interface I beingthe most extensive interface and required for the propagation of single layers of the lament13,15. In contrast, mutations in interfaces II and III displayed a larger variability, ranging from nodefect in ASC speck formation (Y36A, II) or (interface III)), intermediate phenotypes (M76A (interface II) or L15A (interface III)) to complete abrogation in ASC speck formation (Y59A, Q79E, E80R (interface II) or E13R and R41E (interface III)) (Fig. 4c,d upper panels and Supplementary Fig. 4e). Taken together, these data suggest that the formation of ASC specks requires all three interfaces of ASCPYD. We next tested how these mutations affect downstream inflammasome signalling by measuring IL-1 bsecretion (Fig. 4b-d middle panels) and pyroptosis (Fig. 4b-d lowerpanels). In line with the loss of ASC speck formation, interface I proved to be essential for induction of downstream inflamma- some signalling (Fig. 4b). Macrophages expressing mutants in interface III of ASCPYDdisplayed similar phenotypes as interface I mutations: the ability to form ASC specks correlated with bothIL-1bsecretion and pyroptosis, that inflammasome signalling (E13R and R41E), were partiallyaffected (L15A) or not affected at all (P40A) (Fig. 4d). These results show that interface III is important for induction of downstream inflammasome signalling, albeit some mutations are tolerated. Mutants in interface II displayed a differential signalling phenotype (Fig. 4c). Although some mutations had no or only a very small effect on inflammasome signalling (Y36A, E62A and M76A) two mutations (Y59A and E80R) that retained the ability to induce cell death, while losing the ability to release mature IL-1 band to form ASC specks in response to AIM2 stimulation (Fig. 4c middle and lower panels, highlighted in grey).Of note, the ELISA assay displays a higher sensitivity for the mature form of IL-1 bthan the pro-form, thus pro-IL-1 b, which is potentially released into the supernatant by pyroptosis, is poorly detected (Supplementary Fig. 5). To test whether the phenotype of the different mutants is specic response to NLRP3 stimulation by ATP treatment.Asc /C0//C0macrophages expressing the ASC interface I, II and III mutants showed the same phenotype for NLRP3 stimulation asfor pyroptosis on NLRP3 stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 6b, highlighted in grey). Finally, we also examined IL-1 brelease and pyroptosis of macrophages expressing interface with Clostridium difcile Toxin B (TcdB). TcdB was recently described to activate the pyrin inflammasome, which senses modications of Rho GTPases6. Again, Asc/C0//C0macrophages expressing ASCY59Aor ASCE80R were competent for cell death induction but could not efciently release IL-1 b(Supplementary Fig. 6d, highlighted in approach twomutations, maintain receptor interaction . As cell death was still observed in cells expressing ASCY59Aand ASCE80R, we speculated that the mutant proteins retained the ability to interact with the PYD of the receptor, but lost the Interface I LPS + poly(dA:dT) Asc-/- +IL-1 release Figure 4 | Mutations in interface II uncouple speck formation and IL-1 brelease from cell death.

Consistent with our notion, ASCY59A and ASCE80Rretained the ability to interact with AIM2, similar to WT ASC. In contrast, ASCK21Adid not interact with AIM2, possibly explaining the clear-cut phenotypes of interface Imutants (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 6b). Given that ASCY59Aand ASCE80Rmutants still interacted with the receptor (Fig. 5a), but did not form any ASC laments/specks (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 4e), we speculated that the mutations abolished or reduced the ability of ASC to organizeitself into laments following the recruitment to the activatedreceptor. Based on our previous observation that puried ASCPYDor ASCFLform laments in vitro15, we established an assay to monitor the kinetics of this oligomerization process by dynamic light scattering and analysed the kinetics of lament formation for WT ASCPYDand the WT PYDrapidly formed well-structured laments, the K21A mutant was no longer able to oligomerize correctly and formed unspecic aggregates (Fig. 5d). Interestingly, E80R also lost the ability to oligomerize into ordered laments, whereas the Y59A mutant formed well-ordered laments, but at a much slower rate than the WT protein (Fig. 5b-d and Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). Thus, these results conrmed that the ASC-receptor interaction and the ASC lament formation can be uncoupled, and that the ability to rapidly form laments/specks strongly correlates with the levels of cytokine production but not cell death. Gasdermin-D cleavage is independent of ASC oligomerization . The observation that even in the absence of ASC oligomerization inflammasome activation still promotes cell death but not cytokine release (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 4e) was reminiscent of NLRC4 activation in Asc/C0//C0macrophages24. In the absence of ASC, NLRC4 autoprocessing and secretion. We therefore level ASCY59Aand ASCE80Rwere able to promote caspase-1 autoprocessing on activation of theAIM2 inflammasome. In contrast to cells expressing ASCFL, macrophages expressing the mutant proteins displayedsignicantly reduced levels of caspase-1 processing, as determined by western blotting for the released p20 subunit(Fig. 6a). Furthermore, caspase-1 4c and 6a), but not with the induction of cell death (Fig. 4c) and the release of thedanger signal high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) into the cell supernatants (Fig. 6a), an alternative marker for cell lysis during inflammasome activation 51. Similarly, results were obtained on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (Supplementary Fig. 8a).To exclude the possibility that the observed cell death is induced through caspase-1-independent pathways, we knocked out Casp1 by CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene targeting52,53in the cell lines expressing ASCFL, 6b), thus conrming that the cell death observed in the parental cell lines was caspase-1 dependent. Taken together, these data conrm that caspase-1 processing is not a prerequisite for induction of cell death, expanding previous ndings from CARD-containing inflammasome receptors24to PYD-containing receptors. Recent reports showed that a major substrate of caspase-1 responsible for pyroptosis 8c,d), which induces pyroptotic cell death11,12. Consistently, CRISPR-Casp9-mediated Gsdmd knockout Fig. cell death signicantly inresponse to AIM2 and NLRP3 activation (Supplementary Fig. 8f,g). As ASCY59Aand ASCE80Rmutants induced cell death, we speculated that gasdermin-D is still processed in cellsexpressing these mutant forms of ASC. Indeed, although gasdermin-D was not processed in Asc/C0//C0macrophages on stimulation of AIM2 or NLRP3, we observed PYD PYDY59APYDK21A PYDE80RIN t d Figure 5 | ASC-receptor interaction and ASC lament formation can be uncoupled genetically.

Furthermore, processing of gasdermin-D on AIM2 stimulation is results indicated that gasdermin-DNtermcauses the cell death observed in these mutations. As signicant levels of cell death can be observed in Asc-decient macrophages after NLRC4 activation24, but caspase-1 processing is reduced below detection levels, we next determined whether gasdermin-D is processed under these conditions. Indeed, we found that the induction of cell death in S. Typhimurium-infected WT, Asc/C0//C0 and Casp1/C0//C0/Casp11/C0//C0macrophages (Fig. 6d) correlated 6e). Furthermore, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated Gsdmd knockout conrmed that an essential role ininducing pyroptosis during S. Typhimurium infections (Supplementary Fig. 8i). Taken together, these results conrmthat even the smallest amounts of active caspase-1, as judged by the amount of processed caspase-1 p20 subunits, are sufcient to efciently process gasdermin-D and trigger gasdermin-D-induced cell death. On the other hand, large amounts of processed, active caspase-1 are required to produce detectable amounts of mature, bioactive IL-1 bas seen by the direct correlation of the level of caspase-1 processing with the levels of cytokine release.Importantly, the ability of ASC to form laments and ASC specks correlates with caspase-1 activation and cytokine processing, thus supporting a model in which the rapid formation of ASC laments acts as a signal amplication mechanism for inflammasomes, generating a multitude ofcaspase-1 activation sites and thus enabling the cells to rapidly mature IL-1 bbefore the onset of pyroptosis. DiscussionThe formation of higher-order signalling machineries, signalo- somes, for transmission of receptor activation information to cellular responses is an emerging theme in signal transduction 48. It is particularly important in innate immune signalling, wherethe signal generated by a few ligand-receptor interactions needs to trigger an appropriate cellular response. Formation of oligomers has been reported for different signalling adaptors, for example, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 10 (Bcl10) or MAVS laments, the Myddosome36,54,55and others. However, the archetypical supramolecular assembly formed duringinflammasome activation, the ASC speck, has remained relatively poorly understood. Here we present evidence that the formation of ASC speck by oligomerization of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC acts as a signal amplication mechanism for inflammasomes (Fig. 7), as the rapid formation of ASCPYD laments that expose ASCCARDon their surface creates a multitude of pro-caspase-1 recruitment and activation sites. We speculate that such a system might therefore be able to detect the smallest amounts of PAMPs in the host cell cytosol, as recent reports have shown that a single ligand molecule (flagellin, PrgJ) is sufcient to initiate assembly apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP) and 10-12 NLRC4 proteins into a receptor oligomer that acts as seed for ASC oligomerization39,56. Our result reveals that this signal amplication mechanism only applies to cytokine maturation, whereas gasdermin-D-LPS + ASCE80R Casp1-/-/ Asc-/- * d ce Figure 6 | Caspase-1 but not gasdermin-D processing depends on ASC oligomerization. transfection (1mgm l/C01). blot analysis for processing full-length gasdermin-D (GSDMDFL) into the active N-terminal fragment infection (MOI) \u00bc10, 1 h).

Why would cells need to amplify the receptor-generated signal to process IL-1 b/-18? We speculate that a cell will inevitably progress towards pyroptosis, once a fewmolecules of caspase-1 have been activated, given the rapid kinetics by which gasdermin-D is processed57and the strong toxicity of the gasdermin-DNtermfragment11,12. This fate leaves a limited time window to mature the pro-forms of IL-1 b/-18 to their bioactive form. As processing of IL-1 b/-18 occurs with slow kinetics, increasing the amount of active caspase-1 is a means to generate large amounts of bioactive IL-1 b/-18 in the available time window. Consistent with this notion we have observed thatgasdermin-D processing does not correlate with the overall level of active caspase-1. Furthermore, pyroptosis has been observed to occur within 30-60 min in stimulated cells, whereas ASC speck formation was reported to proceed much faster23,58, with all cytosolic ASC being incorporated into a speck in o3 min20,59. Thus, ASC speck formation might serve activate sufcientamounts of caspase-1 to generate enough bioactive cytokinesbefore the cell lyses and releases its intracellular content, including proteolytically matured cytokines. Although recent studies revealed that ASC specks are lamentous in nature22,23, consistent with recently reported structures of human and murine ASCPYDlaments13,15, it was so far unknown how these laments assemble into a speck. Our mutagenesis studies indicates that the clustering of ASCPYD laments and nally their condensation into a dense ASC speckstructure is mediated by the ASCCARD, which, as we have shown15, is exposed on the surface of the ASCPYDlament. These results have uncovered a function for the ASCCARDin ASC speck formation, beyond its role as adaptor domain between receptorand caspase-1. How ASCCARDscondense ASCPYDlaments is unknown, but it can be assumed that either dimeric interactionsbetween ASCCARDsor limited oligomerization of ASCCARDfrom different laments could build lattices interconnecting the 7 Model of signal amplication by ASC laments. (a) CARD-containing receptors recruit the adaptor protein ASC via homotypic CARD-CARD interactions, that is, a bridging ASC molecule. This step nucleates the ASCPYDof several bridging ASC molecules, leading to the formation of an ASCPYD lament, which is condensed into the ASC speck by the ASCCARD. Filament formation promotes the activation of large quantities of caspase-1, thus promoting the proteolytic maturation of large amounts of cytokines (pro-IL-1 b). In the absence of ASC, CARD-containing receptors directly interact with pro-caspase-1, leading to the formation of so-called 'death complexes'. In these small complexes, only few molecules of caspase-1 are activated and pro-caspase-1 processing might not happen. The few molecules of caspase-1 are sufcient to effectively induce pyroptosis, but cytokine processing is reduced. ( b) PYD-containing receptors can directly interact with ASC via homotypic PYD-PYD interactions, leading to ASCPYDlaments and nally the ASC speck. As for CARD-containing receptors, this leads to caspase-1 activation and subsequent cytokine processing and pyroptosis. Mutations blocking orslowing ASC lament formation (for example, ASC E80Ror ASCY59A) only allow for few molecules of caspase-1 being activated. This is sufcient to induce pyroptosis, but insufcient to produce large amounts of mature cytokines before the cell lyses.NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11929 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | 7:11929 | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11929 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 9 117 Resultsthat are required for ASC-pro-caspase-1 interaction are also needed for ASC speck formation. Notably, it has previously been shown that phosphorylation of the ASCCARDat Y144/Y146 is not only required for caspase-1 activation, but also for ASC speck formation60,61Our model of the ASC speck, which includes interactions between the ASCCARDdomains, now provides a structural rationale for these data. To which extent ASC laments are still formed in the absence of ASCCARDphosphorylation remains to be determined. Recently, a unied assembly mechanism was proposed for the PYD-containing receptors AIM2 and NLRP3: the receptorsnucleate clusters of PYD-PYD interactions, which in turn nucleate caspase-1 laments13. In analogy, it was proposed that the receptor NLRC4 directlynucleates caspase-1 laments13,39, as in do require ASC for caspase-1 recruitment.Although direct recruitment of pro-caspase-1 to NLRC4 might indeed happen in Asc-decient cells as we hypothesized before24, it does not seem to efciently activate caspase-1, because we andothers have reported that caspase-1 processing into its p20/p10 subunits and the levels of released mature cytokines are reduced. Furthermore, a large number of ASC specks can be observed in WT cells on NLRC4 activation24-28, indicating that ASC nevertheless plays an important role in NLRC4 signalling. Ourresults now indicate that the ASCCARDlacks the ability to form higher-order oligomers at physiological concentrations, and thateven on NLRC4 activation ASC speck formation relies on the ASCPYD. Our data thus support a model in which CARD- containing receptors initiate ASC speck formation with the helpof ASC bridging molecules, and that the PYDs of these ASC molecules nucleates an ASCPYDlament. Thus, the ASCCARDcan have a triple function in inflammasome signalling on CARD-receptor activation. In conclusion, our study gives insights into the architecture of the ASC speck and the mechanism by which ASC laments assemble this structure. Furthermore, we provide experimental evidence that ASC lament formation serves as an amplicationmechanism in inflammasome signalling, and that this amplica- tion serves to generate sufcient mature cytokines before the onset of pyroptotic cell death. Nevertheless, important questions remain; the higher-resolution structure of the activated NLRC4 receptor has been recently reported 39,56, yet how exactly such receptor complexes with C 10-C12stoichiometry initiate the 3-start ASCPYDlaments is still unknown. Furthermore, the structure of the whole ASC speck assembly, including receptor,ASC and caspase-1, is still lacking and it remains unknown whether other proteins participate in its formation. Finally, additional theoretical and experimental approaches will be necessary to understand if and how ASC speck formation might impart threshold responses, reduce biological noise and control temporal and spatial control of inflammasome signalling. Methods Cell culture .Immortalized BMDM cell lines were generated from bone marrow using infection with a v-myc/v-raf-expressing J2 retrovirus24,62. with 5% CO 2. Generation of monoclonal cell lines with mutations in ASC .Murine AscFLand AscPYDwere with an N-terminal enhanced GFP tag into V48, a derivative of the replication-defective murine stem cell retroviral construct pMSCV2.2 (excision of the IRES-GFP by EcoRI digestion, gift from Thomas Henry). Mutations were introduced by SOE PCR using appropriate oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table 1) and cloned intoV48. GP2 packaging cells were transfected with the individual vectors (9 mg per 1.5/C2106cells) and the lentviral envelope vector VSV-G (Addgene, 6 mg per 1.5/C2106cells), and the retroviral particles were used to transduce Asc/C0//C0iBMDMs (106cells). Seven days later, the transduced iBMDMs were sorted into single cells based on the mCherry or enhanced GFP expression (FACS) andgrown up to clonal cell lines. Up to ten clones of each cell line were tested for inflammasome activation and the level of ASC expression was assessed by western blotting and a representative clone was selected for further analysis. Retroviral transduction of primary BMDMs.For transduction of primary bone marrow cells, retroviral particles were generated in Phoenix-Eco packaging cells and used to transduce WT C57BL/6 bone marrow cells after 48 and 72 h of culture in medium with 10% 3T3-MCSF supernatant. Inflammasome stimulation was performed 4 days after the rst transduction24. Inflammasome stimulation .Immortalized BMDMs (seeded at 250 000 cells per ml in 96-well plates) were primed for 4 h with 100 ng ml/C01LPS O55:B5 (Invivogen). The NLRP3 inflammasome was triggered by addition of 5 mM extracellular ATP (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min. The AIM2 inflammasome was triggered by transfection of 1 mgm l/C01of the synthetic DNA analogue poly(dA:dT) (Invivogen) using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manu- in OptiMEM (Gibco) for 3 h. The NLRC4 inflammasome was triggered by infection of the cells with S. enterica serovar Typhimurium SL1344 at a multiplicity of infection of 10. The infection was synchronized by centrifugation and continued for 60 min. The pyrin inflammasome was triggered by addition of 1 mgm l/C01(nal concentration) of C. difcile toxin B (CdtB, Enzo Biotech) for 2.5 h. Cell death and IL-1 brelease measurements .IL-1brelease was measured by ELISA (eBiosciences). Cell death was quantied by measuring LDH release using the LDH Cytotoxicity detection kit (TaKaRa Clontech). To normalize for spontaneous cell lysis, the percentage of cell death was calculated as follows: [(LDH sample) /C0(LDH negative control)]/[(LDH positive Imaging and quantication of ASC speck formation .Cells were seeded on coverslips (150 000 cells per coverslip) and treated as described above with the addition of 25 mM Z-VAD-fmk (Bachem) to prevent detachment of pyroptotic cells and therefore loss of cells with ASC specks. Coverslips were xed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (15 min, 37 /C176C, Alfa Aesar) and washed with PBS. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) for 10 min and the slides mounted using Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). For quantications of ASC aggregates (specks or laments), ten random regions of interest were imaged at /C220 magnication DFC3000G camera and LAS AF Version 3 software) and the number of ASC aggregates and cells were counted. For representativeimages, the slides were imaged at /C263 magnication /C263 objective, Leica AF software version 3). For measurements of speck sizes, random regions of interest were images at /C263 magnication (Leica point scanning confocal 'SP8') and the largest diameters of individual specks were measured using Fiji63. Western blotting .For western blotting of supernatant and lysate samples, cells were seeded at 106cells per well in six-well plates and treated as described above. Supernatants were precipitated with 10% trichloracetic acid, precipitates washedwith acetone and resuspended in 40 ml1/C2SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled at 95/C176C for 10 min. Cells were lysed with 200 ml1/C2RIPA (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% NP-40, 1 (Roche)) 30 min on ice. Lysates were re-suspended in 5/C2SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled at 95 /C176C for 10 min64. For combined supernatant and lysates, samples were prepared as above, but supernatant precipitates were resuspended in lysate samples. Samples were 12% (combined SN \u00felysates) acrylamide gels (1 h, 170 V, 40 mA per gel), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (1 h, 100 V constant), blocked milk in Tris-buffered saline \u00feTween-20 (TBS-T) and incubated with primary antibodies BSA-TBS-T for 16 h at 4 /C176Co r2ha t room temperature with agitation. Secondary antibodies were diluted 1:5,000 in 5% milk-TBS-T and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were developed using either LumiGLO (KPL) or LumiGLO Reserve (KPL). The following used: anti-Caspase-1 p20 (Genentech, 1:1,000; 7), rabbit anti-gasdermin-D (1:2,000, G7422, Sigma, gures) and Sigma, 1:1,000).ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | DOI: 10.1038/ncomms11929 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 118 ResultsCo-immunoprecipitation .Co-immunoprecipitation was done according to a modied protocol published previously49. For assessment of ASC/AIM2 interactions, 3 /C2800,000 HEK293T cells were transfected with 2 mg per ASC-mCherry (ASCFL,A S CK21A,A S CY59Aor ASCE80R) ratio of 1:4 using linear polyethylenimine (PEI, at a 1:4 (refs 65,66). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the were washed twice with ice-cold 1 /C2PBS and lysed using HEK lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM Na 3VO 4, 5 mM NaF, 0.5 % Nonidet P-40 and 1/C2protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Lysates were sonicated for 5 /C27 s before removing debris and non-lysed cells by centrifugation (10,000 g, 15 min, 4 /C176C). The samples were incubated with 1 mg mouse anti-V5 antibody (R960-25, Invitrogen) or a control antibody (mouse anti-GFP, 632381, Clontech) with agitation for 16 h at 4 /C176C. For assessment of ASCCARD/ASCCARDinteractions, 3 /C2800 000 HEK293T cells were transfected with S CPYD, ASCD134R), 1mg 0.2 mg AIM2-V5, to initiate ASC/ASC interactions using linear PEI. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were washed, lysed and sonicated as described above. The samples were then incubated with 1 mg mouse anti-mCherry antibody (ab125096, Abcam) or a control antibody (mouse anti-HA, MMS-101R-200, Covance). The samples were then incubated with agitation for 2 h at 4 /C176C with 25 ml Pierce Protein A Plus Agarose bead slurry (22810, Thermo Scientic). Beads were washed three times with lysisbuffer (centrifugation 1 min 1,000 g,4/C176C), resuspended in 2 /C2SDS-PAGE sample buffer (30 ml) and boiled at 95 /C176C, before analysing the eluted proteins by western blotting as above. CRISPR-Cas9-mediated Caspase1 targeting (50-ggtca agaatgtgatcaagg-30) were cloned into lentiCRISPRv2 a cassette (Addgene53). These constructs were transfected into HEK293T cells using PEI (as described above) together with the lentiviral packaging vector PsPax2 (Addgene) and the lentviral envelope vector VSV-G (Addgene). Sixteen hours after transfection, medium was exchanged with macrophage medium and incubated at 37 /C176C for 2 days to produce lentiviral particles. The lentiviral particles were used to transfect the immortalized macrophage cell lines (800,000 cells per well in 6-well plates) using polybrene (Merck) to favour virus attachment. Two days after viral transduction, the macrophages were expanded. Attached macrophages were then treated with 10 mgm l/C01puromycin (Gibco) for 6 days to select for successful lentiviral transduction. After puromycin selection, the cells were tested for successful knockout by western blotting. Expression and purication of ASCPYD.The ASCPYD(residues 1-91) was cloned with a C-terminal His 6tag into the pET28a vector under the control of a T7 promoter. Protein expression was induced by isopropyl- b-D-thiogalactopyranosid addition in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli at an OD 600of 0.8 for 4 h at 37 /C176C. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, with Complete protease inhibitor (Roche). Resuspended bacteria were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with DNase I, sonicated on ice and centrifuged at 20,000 gat 4 /C176C for 30 min. The pellet, including ASCPYD-containing inclusion bodies, was solubilized in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 6 M guanidinium hydrochloride and centrifuged at 20,000 g at 4 /C176C for 30 min. The supernatant was incubated for 2 h at room temperature with pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA afnity resin (Thermo Scientic) and then passed through a plastic body column for gravity flow purication. The column was washed with 20 column volumes of solubilization buffer containing 20 mM imidazole and eluted with 3 column volumes of solubilization buffer with 500 mM imidazole. The pH of the elution fraction was decreased to 3.8 and dialysed against 50 mM glycine buffer pH 3.8, 150 mM NaCl. The protein was further puried on a pre-equilibrated Superdex 75 gel ltration column (GE Healthcare). This gel-ltration step removed traces of pre-existing aggregates and yielded highlypure, monomeric soluble form of ASCPYD. Samples were either used immediately or stored after flash-freezing in small aliquots in liquid N 2. Measurements of ASCPYDlament formation kinetics in vitro .Immediately before the experiments, samples of monomeric soluble ASCPYDwere centrifuged at 20,000 gat 4 /C176C for 30 min and ltered with 0.1 mM lter (Millipore). The protein concentration was adjusted to 25 mM by dilution from a higher-concentrated stock solution. Filament formation was triggered by rapid dilution to neutral pH.Thereby, 70 ml of monomeric ASCPYDwas mixed with 0.45 ml of 2.75 M NaOH solution to a reach the pH of 7.5. The solution was mixed at room temperature by careful pipetting, to avoid introduction of air bubbles, and immediately transferredto a quartz cuvette with 1 cm path length. Between runs, cuvettes were carefully cleaned with 1 M Hellmanex solution (Sigma-Aldrich) to avoid cross-seeding effects between sequential measurements. Filament growth was monitored by dynamic light scattering with a Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS series instrument. The laser focal spot was positioned in the middle of the cuvette and maintained xed for all the measurements. To maximize the intensity of the scattered light, the minimal attenuation level was used. Data were acquired in 60 s intervals by averaging three runs of 20 s, until a total time of 350 min. Afterwards, the proteinsolution was blotted on EM grids, negatively stained and imaged with transmission electron microscopy to visualize lament formation. Data analysis.Filament growth was modelled assuming pseudo-rst-order kinetics where the lament propagation step occurs by the addition of monomers to the initial growth centre. The time-dependent growth signal Iwas tted independently for each measurement by a single exponential function, It\u00f0\u00de\u00bc I11/C0e/C0kFt \u00f0\u00de/C16/C17 where INcorresponds to the signal at time tand at innitive time, respectively, and kFis the rst-order rate constant. Fits were done with nonlinear least-square minimization. Data availability .The data that support the ndings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request.

A series of papers by us and other groups has now shown that the cytotoxicity of this N-terminal fragment is due to its ability to target, insert and permeabilize cellular membranes, therefore representing a novel class of pore forming proteins (Figure \u0014 \u0003>\u0017\u000f\u0003\u0018\u000f\u0003\u0019\u000f\u0003\u001a@\u0011\u0003 To understand how the GSDMDNterm induces pyroptosis, we started by investigating its subcellular localization using biochemical fractionation and membrane extraction methods.

Strikingly, the generation of the GSDMDNterm also correlated with the appearance of large plasma membrane pores and cell lysis, a characteristic feature of pyroptosis. These results indicated that GSDMDNterm either forms a pore in the host cell plasma membrane or interacts with additional proteins to promote assembly of such a pore. To demonstrate that the GSDMDNterm is the sole executor of pyroptosis and that it has intrinsic pore forming ability, we next established a liposome-based in vitro different lipid compositions showed that GSDMD Nterm targets membranes, whereas GSDMDCterm and full-length GSDMD remained soluble. Furthermore, this interaction resulted in a rapid release of the dye from the liposomes, indicating that the GSDMDNterm can by itself permeabilize membranes. How does the GSDMDNterm liposomes?

Intriguingly, all gasdermin family members share similar N-terminal domains and these domains all exhibit comparable pore forming activity [2, 5]. While the exact stoichiometry and structure of the GSDMD pore has not yet been determined, Ding et al. were recently able to show that the pore formed by mouse *6'0$\u0016\u0003FRQWDLQV\u0003\u0014\u0019\u0003V\\PPHWULF\u0003SURWRPHUV\u0003DQG\u0003KDV\u0003DQ\u0003 inner diameter of 10-14 nm5. Moreover the high-resolution crystal structure of mouse gasdermin A3 revealed the structural basis for is most likely conserved in the gasdermin family. Gasdermins have emerged as a family of new class of cell death inducers, but many questions remain unanswered. For example, it is still unclear how other family members beside GSDMD are activated and how this is regulated on the post-translation level. Furthermore, if and how these proteins are implicated in physiological and pathological cell death pathways, will be an extremely interesting question to address. As caspase-11 and GSDMD were shown to be the central mediators in a murine model of sepsis, the GSDMD pore might also be a possible target for treating symptoms of septic shock. Beyond that, pyroptotic activity of all gasdermin family members could be a useful tool or target to modulate cell GHDWK\u0003DFURVV\u0003GLIIHUHQW\u0003\u00bfHOGV\u0003RI\u0003FHOO\u0003ELRORJ\\\u0011 Petr Broz: Focal Area Infection Biology, Biozentrum, University of Basel, Switzerland Correspondence to: Petr Broz, email petr.broz@unibas.ch Keywords: cell death, caspases Received : August 11, 2016 Published: August 19, of the non-canonical inflammasome pathway 4.7. 1 Intro In recent years the development of novel genome editing tools has facilitated the identification and study of unknown genes tremendously. The discovery of the CRISPR Cas9 system represented probably the most important advancement in the field of gene editing. This system is found in several bacteria where it acts as a defence mechanism against bacteriophages through degradation of foreign DNA elements (Pourcel et al, 2005),(Mojica et al ). The development of CRISPR as a genome editing tool was pioneered by several groups(Jinek et al , 2012),(Le Cong et al , 2013). The CRISPR Cas9 system relies on two major components for its function. The Cas9 nuclease, which is proficient in inducing breaks in double stranded DNA and the guideRNA (gRNA), which is capable of directing the Cas9 protein to virtually any DNA sequence of interest by using a complementary 20bp DNA sequence. As these components can be functionally expressed independently from each other, this allows for design of any gRNA to direct the Cas9 nuclease to any (genomic) DNA sequence desired. Upon induction of the double strand break in the genomic DNA by Cas9, eukaryotic cells will repair the damage by 2 possible mechanisms 1) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or 2) homology directed repair. NHEJ is not always correct therefore leading to insertions or deletions (INDELs) at the cutting site, which can lead to frameshift mutations and can be employed to render a gene of interest non-functional. Homology directed repair instead by default uses the second allele of the gene as a correction template, however this mechanism can be exploited by providing a template of interest, allowing the generation of a knock-in around the Cas9 cutting site. Further applications of the CRISPR system are reviewed in(Sander & Joung, 2014) , and include among other CRISPR silencing. As mentioned above, single gRNAs are sufficient to direct the Cas9 to a gene of interest, so this made it possible to design libraries containing several guide RNAs against all genes in the genome (Shalem et al , 2014). Generation of these libraries allowed forward genetic screens by means of negative selection, making studies of different cell death pathways particularly amenable to these negative selection screen (Sanjana et al, 2014). Shortly after the introduction of these CRISPR Cas9 libraries along with Cas9 tg mice (Platt et al, 2014) it became apparent that these screens could also be used in primary cells and were not limited 125 Resultsto negative selection by cell death (Parnas et al, 2015). Nevertheless, meaningful results, like the discovery of gasdermin-D describe above, could be obtained using cell death based CRISPR Cas9 screens(Shi et al, 2015a). However, the complete spectrum of genes involved in promoting survival during non-canonical inflammasome activation was not disclosed in the study by Shi et al. We therefore sought to investigate the non-canonical inflammasome pathway using a negative selection based CRISPR/Cas9 screen to find previously unknown regulators of this pathway. 4.7.2 Experimental design Following established protocols(Sanjana et al , 2014), (Shi et al , 2015a) we obtained the murine GeCKO V2 library from addgene containing 130 000 gRNAs, amplified and purified the plasmids from E. Coli and produced lentiviral particles in HEK293T cells. The titer of the obtained viral supernatant was determined by transducing primary BMDMs tg w ere transduced at a low MOI and transduced cells were selected using puromycin. A sample of cells was collected as a not stimulated reference to verify representation of the gRNAs present. To stimulate the non-canonical inflammasome pathway, cells were electroporated with LPS. Surviving cells were grown and genomic DNA was prepared for three independent experiments. The gRNA sequences were amplified using specific primers, purified and submitted for next-generation-sequencing (NGS). 4.7.3 Results Analysis of the NGS results obtained revealed that representation of all gRNAs prior to stimulation was comparable across all biological repeats. Unfortunately, only replicate two showed and enrichment of a small number of gRNAs and a depletion of a majority of genes, which is the desired result for a cell death-based screen as the majority of cell should succumb to the cell death stimulus. The other two replicates showed incomplete selection of a subpool of gRNAS most likely due to high survival (i.e. too little cell death) of cells. However, replicate two revealed caspase-11 as a top hit, serving as a positive control. Why exactly gasdermin-D as another known essential component was not found enriched after LPS electroporation remains unclear. 126 ResultsTo reduce the amount of hits we eliminated all genes, where only one gRNA was found and considered only genes with a p value higher than 0.01 for further analysis. 287 genes matched these criteria ( Supplementary Table 1). Using KEGG pathway analysis, 11 pathways were detected, which contained more than 3 proteins present. These pathways with the proteins present are summarized in table 1. TLR2 and TLR4 were prominent hits, potentially indicating that our experimental setup used, induced TLR dependent cell death, which might be due to prolonged LPS exposure over 10 days. It has actually been shown that the non- canonical inflammasome pathway is independent of TLR4 ((Kayagaki et al, 2013; Hagar et al, 2013). There were some histone proteins detected, which were previously implicated in the necroptotic pathway. Multiple gRNAs of all members were detected, potentially indicating that the whole histone cluster could be important for pyroptosis induction. Lama2 is a member of the extracellular matrix proteins and implicated in the activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which is crucial for cell survival and proliferation. Another hit, Gngt2, potentially also acts in this pathway ( Table 3 ). It might be conceivable that cells lacking these proteins had a significant growth advantage during the experiment, however it might be worth investigating the importance of the AKT pathway during caspase-11 mediated pyroptosis, especially as there are highly potent and specific pharmacological inhibitors for this pathway. 127 ResultsPathway Number of proteins PIK3/AKT 4 Gngt2; laminin, alpha 2 Tlr2; toll-like 4 Alcohol abuse 4 Gngt2; guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma toll-like receptor 4 4.7.4 Discussion Although we tested repeatedly the efficiency of cell d eath upon LPS electroporation, the induction of cell death across all biological replicates using one round of LPS electroporation was not sufficient to obtain consistent enrichment of the genes known to be involved in the non-canonical inflammasome pathway. Further CRISPR-Cas9 screen need to be performed using a stimulus, which is applied for multiple rounds to ensure complete depletion of insignificant gRNAs from the pool. The procedure furthermore should be optimized using recently published protocols and guidelines for genetic forward CRISPR screens(Joung et al, 2017). These guidelines include for example a more sophisticated and precise protocol for determination of viral titers as well as technical considerations for performance of CRISPR/Cas9 based screen. Potentially other interesting screens to be performed using the cell lines generated might include screening for essential genes involved in activation of the pyrin inflammasome, as this inflammasome is probably the least well understood. Delivery of bacterial effectors that modify RhoA using the anthrax lethal factor-protective antigen (LF-PA) could be evaluated as potential stimuli. Table 3 Enriched pathways after NGS sequencing of surviving cells upon LPS electroporation 130 Results 4.7.5 Material and Methods Preparation and amplification of library The GeCKOv2 library comes in two half libraries (A and B). They need to be amplified separately. The steps described below are representative for ONE half library. The library was diluted to 50 ng/ml and 2 \u00b5l of this solution was added to 25 \u00b5l of Lucigen Endura electrocompetent cells. Bacteria were electroporated and recovered in 2 ml of media. This was repeated for a total of 4 electroporations and the bacteria were put on a rotating wheel at 37 \u00b0C for 1 hour. 8 ml of bacterial solution were plated on 20 pre-warmed 10 cm agar plates + ampicillin. To estimate transformation efficiency the bacterial suspension was diluted 1:100 in LB (10 \u00b5l in 1ml) and 20 \u00b5l of this dilution (40 000-fold final dilution) was plated as well. Plates we re grown overnight at 32 \u00b0C. Bacteria were scraped off in LB and pelleted by centrifugation. 6 endotoxin free maxipreps (Qiagen) were performed per half library, dilution of DNA solution was adjusted to 1 \u00b5g/\u00b5l and 50 \u00b5l aliquots were frozen to -80 \u00b0C. Transduction of macrophages To prepare viral particles, HEK293T cells were seeded at a density of 5 million per 10 cm dish one day prior to transfection. Cells were transfected with GeCKO plasmids, PsPax2 and a ratio of 9:9:1 \u00b5g and 60 \u00b5l of linear PEI. Medium was exchanged 8 hours post transfection, viral particles were collected after 36 hours and aliquots were frozen to -80 \u00b0C. To estimate viral titers, primary wildtype BMDMs were differentiated for 6 days and transduced with different volumes of the viral supernatant by spin transduction (1900 xg 90 min). After 2 days cells were treated with 5 \u00b5g/ml puromycin for 6 days and number of surviving enumerated using flow cytometry. Immortalized Cas9 tg BMDMs were seeded at a density of 400'000 cells per well of a 12 well plate (24 wells in total). Cells were transduced at a MOI of 0.3 by spin infection and transduced cells were selected after 48 hours with 10 \u00b5g/ml puromycin for 6 days. 131 ResultsElectroporation Prior to electroporation 4x107 cells wer e pelleted by centrifugation and frozen to -80 \u00b0C as a not stimulated reference. Before electroporation, cells were washed 3 times with PBS and counted whereafter they were electroporated with 1\u00b5 g/106 cells 1300 volts/20 ms width/2 pulses) and recovered in medium without antibiotics. After cells had grown to confluency (approximately 10 days), 4 x 10 7 cells were pelleted by centrifugation and frozen to -80 \u00b0C. Genomic DNA prep and amplification Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two elutions per column were performed in the end to enhance the amount of recovered DNA. DNA was precipitated using sodium acetate and isopropanol. 1/5 5M sodium acetate of the volume of the DNA solution was added and the solution was vortexed well. An equal volume of isopropanol was added to precipitate the gDNA. Samples were centrifuged at 21 000 xg, 4 \u00b0C for 15 minutes, washed once with 70% Ethanol and centrifuged again as described above. Samples were resuspended to approximately 4-5 \u00b5g/\u00b5l. Next gRNAs were amplified by PCR. Per screen, at least 200 \u00b5g of DNA (approx. 30 Million cells), divided into 6x50 \u00b5l PCR reactions were used prepared using the NEBNext Ultra Q5 2x Master Mix. The following protocol was used: 95\u00b0C 60s, 40 cycles of [94\u00b0C for 30s,55\u00b0C for 10s and 72\u00b0C for 10s] and final 2-min extension at 72\u00b0C. PCR reactions were combined and loaded on a 1% agarose gel, separated by electrophoresis and purified using a commercial gel extraction kit. PCR products were stored at -20 \u00b0C and submitted for NGS. 132 Results4.7.6 Supplementary Table 1 Gene_ID Number of gRNAs p value gRNAs 4 Chd5 6 0.0099912 5 140 Results5 Discussion 5.1 Regulation of immunity by ectosomes A direct membrane contact is the easiest and most apparent way of two neighbouring cells to communicate. For longer distances in turn, soluble proteins like interleukins, chemokines, cytokines and bioactive mediators are needed for efficient transmission of information in the body. In recent years the shedding of extracellular microvesicles (EVs) from cells has been brought forward as an alternative for intermediate to long distance communications (Johnstone, 2006; Th\u00e9ry et al, 2009; Cocucci et al, 2009). be classified into ectosomes or shedding microvesicles (SMVs) and apoptotic bodies (Kalra et al, 2016). They share the common trait that they are vesicles, surrounded by a lipid bi-layer and encapsulating cellular content, whereas they are very heterogeneous in size, ranging from 1- 100 nm for exosomes, 50-1000 nm for ectosomes and up to 5 \u00b5m for apoptotic bodies. Exosomes are the best studied type of EVs(Mathivanan et al, 2010) and the term exosome refers actually to intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of MVB that are released to the extracellular space when an MVB fuses with the PM. ILV require the ESCRT machinery for formation, by budding into the MVB luminal space(Colombo et al, 2013). MVB trafficking to the cell periphery and fusion with the PM requires multidimensional changes in the actin cytoskeleton, actin-PM interactions, local enzymatic degradation and activation of the membrane fusion machinery (Simons & Raposo, 2009). As mentioned above, ectosomes are more heterogeneous in terms of size distribution. Shedding of these microvesicles happens at sites of Ca 2+ influx, which leads to rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton and exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) through the action of the calcium dependent scramblase TMEM16F (Suzuki et al, 2010). Generation of lipid asymmetry primes the PM for curvature to the outside, however the generation and pinching off of the ectosomes strictly requires the ESCRT-III machinery(Nabhan et al, 2012; Jimenez al, 2014; Scheffer ectosomes shed by human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (hPMNs) upon stimulation with LPS or N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) are PS positive (Zwaal & Schroit, 1997; Hess et al, 1999). To date, we know that human monocytes undergo inflammasome dependent IL-1 secretion without pyroptosis(Gaidt et al, 2016), which might be gasdermin- D dependent. It has been observed that Annexin-V staining on stimulated PMNs is patchy(Frasch et al, 2004) and although we lack thorough analysis about the 141 Discussiondistribution of PS on the PM membrane during inflammasome stimulation in murine BMDMs or human monocytes one can easily imagine, that the patchy Annexin- V staining is the result of ESCRT-III mediated membrane shedding is response to gasdermin-D pore formation. More research will be required to determine the spatiotemporal assembly of ESCRT during inflammasome signalling and possibly visualize ectosome shedding. One of the main challenges in the future will be to develop reliable isolation methods for ectosomes. As ectosomes are, both in size and composition, a very heterogeneous population of EVs, it will be important to define transmembrane antigens, common to ectosomes, which will allow affinity based isolation of these vesicles (Kalra et al, 2016). Ectosomes from PMNs, probably due to their high concentration of PS (Refs), have been shown act in an anti-inflammatory manner (Gasser & Schifferli, 2004) by inhibiting cytokine secretion from activated macrophages . In case future research will be able to demonstrate, that cells which undergo inflammasome activation secrete ectosomes in a significant quantity, it will be of interest if (a) these ectosomes are comparable to the vesicles discovered in PMN in terms of composition and (b) what the effect of these vesicle on other immune and non-immune c ells are. 5.2 Gasdermin-D mediated pore formation as the mechanism of unconventional secretion Since its discovery by Dinarello et al in 1984, IL-1 has been of great interest for immunologists and cell biologists. Over time the IL-1 family grew and to date consists of 11 members and most of them, although being released to the extracellular environment do not have a signal sequence, which directs them to the conventional ER-GOLGI mediated secretion. Therefore, multiple pathways of 'unconventional secretion' for IL-1 have been proposed(Monteleone et al, 2015). 'Unconventional secretion' is a catch- all term for different models ranging from secretion in secretory lysosomes, to autophagy mediated secretion, transport across a hyperpermeable membrane, release by PM pores and release by passive lysis. All models proposed suffer from incomplete data and most importantly genetics to prove one or the other mechanism as a valid pathway of IL-1 secretion (discussed in Monteleone et al., 2015). The discovery of gasdermin-D for the first time allowed researchers to uncouple cell death from IL-1 secretion(Shi et al, 2015a; Kayagaki et al, 2015; He et al, 2015). Our results and studies from several other groups (Aglietti et al, 2016; Chen et al, 2016b; Ding et al, 2016; Sborgi et al, 2016; Liu et al, 2016) for the first time defined a 142 Discussionpossible mechanism for lysis independent release of IL-1 mechanism, by showing that the GSDMDNterm forms pore of a certain range of sizes in the PM prior to pyroptosis. Follow up studies from our lab(Heilig et al, 2017) proved this hypothesis by showing that blocking cell lysis, does not reduce gasdermin-D dependent IL-1 secretion and that gasdermin-D pores allow the passage of mature IL-1 in liposomes. Evavold et al. confirmed these findings further characterizing the role of gasdermin-D mediated pore formation during a process they call macrophage (or DC) 'hyperactivation'(Evavold et al, 2017). Macrophage or DC hyperactivation is characterized by IL-1 secretion, stimulated by inflammasome activation, without detectable cell death and lysis. Several stimuli in different cell types have been proposed to lead to IL-1 secretion without detectable levels of cell lysis. These were for example the aforementioned stimulation of human monocytes with LPS, which mediates IL- 1 release through a TRIF/RIPK1/CASP8/Nlrp3 dependent signalling axis(Gaidt et al, 2016) or stimulation of murine cells with PGN(Wolf et al, 2016)or OxPAPC(Zanoni et al, 2016) . Both studies show that IL-1 release during stimulation of DCs or macrophages with PGN and OxPAPC is gasdermin-D dependent. These studies therefore suggest convincingly for the first time by genetic means that release of IL-1 through gasdermin-D pores is one, if not the only mechanism of cytokine release in the absence of cell lysis. It should be noted that both, in vitro and in vivo , the contribution of pyroptosis to IL-1 release is much higher than the release through gasdermin-D pores without pyroptosis. This means that the relative cytokine levels measured in the absence of pyroptosis are much lower than the levels of IL-1b elicited by stimuli, which induce pyroptosis (Zanoni et al, 2017). It remains to be investigated if the alternative inflammasome pathway in human monocytes also relies on gasdermin-D mediated pore formation for IL-1 secretion. These results lead to several questions, one of them being: How do cells manage to survive in the face of gasdermin-D pore formation? Our results provide an answer to this question, suggesting that membrane repair mechanisms allow cells to survive during hyperactivation without succumbing to gasdermin-D pore formation but mediating IL-1 release at the same time via GSDMD pores. Furthermore, as the ESCRT-III machinery leads to budding of ectosomes at the site of PM injury(Jimenez et al, 2014; Scheffer et al, 2014) one could hypothesize that these ectosomes might contain IL-1 and that ectosome release also contributes to unconventional IL-1 secretion, in line with previous reports that suggested that IL-1b is released within vesicles. I think this rather unlikely because our data suggest that upon inactivation of the ESCRT machinery, IL-1 secretion is enhanced during canonical and 143 Discussionnon-canonical inflammasome stimulation. However, since ESCRT inactivation enhances the levels of GSDMD pores formed in the PM and cell lysis, most IL-1 is then released in a manner dependent on lysis. Thus, by only inhibiting ESCRT it is difficult to unravel the contribution of each possible pathway to the overall level of IL-1 release. One goal for future research will be to develop more sophisticated methods of ectosome isolation to clarify the question if mature IL-1 is contained within these or other extracellular vesicles. 144 Discussion6 References Aglietti RA, Estevez A, Gupta A, Ramirez MG, Liu PS, Kayagaki N, Ciferri C, Dixit VM & Dueber EC (2016) GsdmD p30 Toll-like Nature reviews.
