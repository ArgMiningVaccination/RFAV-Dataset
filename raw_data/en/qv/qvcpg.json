She utilizes a functional approach that evaluates the underlying biological and medical needs of the children including physical complaints such as chronic diarrhea or constipation, sleep disturbances, eczema and rashes, behavioral issues and frequent illnesses. The original thinking about autism viewed it as a mental health issues, but recent ground-breaking research shows that ASD is biological in nature. ASD includes components of genetics, immune dysregulation, elevated heavy metals, inflammation, enzyme dysfunction, dysbiosis and altered neurotransmitter biochemistry - a complicated picture! Biomedical treatments do not help every child, but the majority of children with ASD, ADD, ADHD, Tourette's Syndrome and other developmental issues do demonstrate mild to significant benefits. Herbal or botanical medicine is a well-studied tradition of naturopathic medicine. The herbs can be given in the form of teas, tinctures (liquid solutions) or capsules. Dr. Janet will prescribe specific herbs for their medicinal properties and formulate recipes that include a number of appropriate herbs for you or your child's health conditions. The exciting news about herbal medicine is that the effectiveness may be just as strong as pharmaceuticals but without the negative side effects. Heavy metal toxicity has become a growing concern in our world of pollutants and environmental hazards. The detection of toxic levels of heavy metals such as mercury, aluminum, lead, cadmium, etc. is challenging and sometimes difficult to quantify. Hair analysis tests are a good place to start, which may then be followed by more specific testing. Before pursing heavy metal detoxification, your or your child's gut needs to be functioning properly along with good nutrient status and cellular function. A wide variety of treatments are then available for detoxification including oral DMSA or DMPS, transdermal DMPS or EDTA, homeopathic remedies and supplement regimes. The detoxification process needs to be done with supervision and specific regimes for the individual person. Dietary choices make an incredible difference on how you or your child feels and functions! Gluten free, casein free and soy free diets are playing an important role in many health care issues. The challenges of pesticides and non-GMO foods constantly challenge us in our quest to eat nutritious, healthy foods. \"You are what you eat, eats!\" is advice to consider when making your food choices. Dr. Janet can help assist you in your food journey. Homeopathy is a medical science that was developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German physician. He discovered that \"like cures like,\" which means that any substance that causes a healthy person to become ill will also do the opposite of causing an ill person to become healthy. Studies have been conducted showing the effectiveness of homeopathy even though the scientific basis is not yet understood. Aristotle, Hippocrates, Hindu masters have all made reference to positive homeopathic results. Dr. Janet will prescribe your homeopathy remedies based on you or your child's unique constitution, physical, emotional and mental status. Hydrotherapy involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment of health conditions. The water therapy takes advantage of the properties of temperature and pressure to stimulate circulations, facilitate relaxation and encourage homeostasis in the body. Dr. Janet may make suggestions for home-treatment hydrotherapy activities using contrast water sessions, mineral baths, whirlpools, sauna, etc. Daily life can often present a myriad of situations and relationships that become difficult or confusing to juggle. Taking time to meet with Dr. Janet will provide you with an oasis of support and an unbiased view of your life questions. This counseling does not substitute for psychological treatment, but provides functional, practical solutions to facilitate your optimal well-being. Even though you or your child may be eating a great diet, sometimes the intake of vitamins and minerals is just not adequate and/or they are not be absorbed. You or your child's treatment plan may need to include some vitamin and mineral supplements to support optimal health.
