The author has contributed to this field by identifying an alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. It allows cells to acquire energy via a mechanism other than the metabolism of food.

Controlled trials are required to determine the scope and extent of clinical benefits achievable from administering and/or consuming KELEA activated water. Syndrome; CPE: Cytopathic Effect Introduction The pursuit of the pharmaceutical approach to medicine has led to important detailed understanding of complex biochemical pathways operating within living cells. According to this model, diseases are viewed as specific metabolic aberrations, typically occurring within a particular cell type or organ. The disorders may be intrinsic to the affected cells or imposed from extrinsic factors, including microbes and/or toxins. Chemical compounds can then be developed as pharmaceutical drugs. Therapeutic benefit is based upon the drug's more or less selective capacity to correct the identified biochemical imbalance that had resulted in disease; or in the case of cancer, to selectively kill the abnormal cells. Similarly, drugs and vaccines can be developed to kill infecting microbes or to empower the immune system to do so, respectively. The inevitable side effect of using drugs is their influence on essentially the same metabolic pathway in non-diseased cells of the body [1]. The resulting changes in normal cells are considered as tolerable side effects of drug therapy. Unfortunately, drugs are commonly not as highly specific in their biochemical actions as first anticipated and this too can lead to additional side effects, especially in some individuals. To help address this potentially serious limitation of drug therapy, major efforts are underway to more precisely define the biochemical complexities in individual patients (their biome). The information is then used to select the most appropriate drug and its dosage for each patient. This increasingly costly approach to healthcare is referred to as precision medicine [2]. The focus on cellular biochemistry has diminished progress into biophysical approaches to medicine [3]. Unlike biopharmaceutical therapies that require the drug to localize to its site of action, biophysical energies can be generated away from the body and yet still have potentially beneficial cellular effects. Because biophysical \"field effects\" are less well understood than biochemical processes, they are provided with less patent protection than offered to drug discoveries. This factor, along with the scientific uncertainty of biophysics, has tended to limit open dialogue between practitioners of what is commonly called alternative medicine. To help minimize confrontation with mainstream medicine, which boasts of being evidence based, alternative medicine is usually portrayed as merely providing additive or complementary benefits [4]. Significant scientific advances can be realized in the pursuit of topics within complementary & alternative medicine (CAM). The research summarized in this article began with an inquiry into a possible virus cause of the chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Molecular studies implicated a range of differing viruses, but with the common feature of not evoking an inflammatory response. Yet the viruses were still able to cause profound cell damaging, cytopathic effects (CPE) in virus cultures. The viruses were termed stealth because of the apparent failure of effective immune recognition and the immune evasion process was called stealth adaptation [5,6]. Positive virus cultures were not restricted to, or a defining feature of CFS, but were commonly also obtained from patients with neuropsychiatric illnesses, including autism [6,7]. Moreover, not all infected individuals were necessarily sick, with at least 10% of asymptomatic individuals yielding positive, although generally weak, virus culture results. Patient-derived stealth adapted viruses were able to induce acute, severe behavioral illness in cats, which was followed by clinical recovery in spite of there being no inflammation [8]. Understanding the recovery process has led to the important realization that administering activated water, even orally, may well provide major clinical benefits in many illnesses, without any attendant toxicity. The simplicity of activating water and, if proven, its widespread therapeutic usefulness should greatly reduce healthcare costs. It will also help minimize the current costly emphasis on precision diagnoses. Significant agricultural and industrial benefits can also be realized using activated water and other fluids [9]. The following discussion is intended to lay the foundation for current basic research endeavors and to encourage participation in efforts to help reshape and improve medical practice. Review of Early Studies on Stealth Adapted Viruses Using conventional virus culture methods, extracts from blood cells of CFS patients would commonly induce a transient CPE in many cell types [5,10]. The CPE would progress when the cultures were frequently re-fed with fresh tissue culture medium. Even cultures with extensive CPE would recover if not re-fed. The recovery correlated with the production of cellular materials with energy converting properties. The materials self-assembled into particles and fibers, easily seen in extracellular fluids since many were pigmented. Adding small numbers of extracellular particles from recovered cultures could prevent the reactivation of the CPE upon re-feeding other cultures with fresh medium [11]. A similar protection from reactivation of the CPE was achieved by adding a supposedly homeopathic product to the tissue culture medium. The product called HANSI (homeopathic activator of the natural system immune) was developed in Argentina with input from a German physician. Its formula became available to a United States corporation, which provided product for testing to the author. Largely based on its author's virus culture findings, the US manufacturer changed the name of the product to Enercel. The author later identified Lidocaine in the product that he had tested and confirmed that Lidocaine is also present in some formulations of HANSI. Strong positive virus cultures were repeatedly obtained using blood samples from patients with various non-inflammatory and non-progressing neuropsychiatric illnesses [12-15]. Of particular interest to the author was the consistent finding of positive cultures in children with autism and when tested, from mothers of autistic children. While some of the mothers disclosed that they were experiencing CFS-like symptoms, many were either only mildly ill or asymptomatic. This and other findings, including the recovery seen in cats inoculated with cultured viruses [8], were consistent with suppression of virus infection in spite of the apparent evasion of the cellular immune system. Histological and electron microscopic examination of tissues obtained from stealth adapted virus infected patients [16] and from virus inoculated animals confirmed the production of intracellular and extracellular particulate materials, similar to that seen in virus cultures. A striking feature of the in vivo infected cells was the marked disruption of mitochondria, the major site of cellular energy production. It appeared as if the particulate materials may be providing an alternative to mitochondria as a source of cellular energy. The proposed source of energy was referred to as the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway [11,16]. Alternative Cellular Energy (ACE) Pigments The composition and energy converting properties of particulate materials obtained from virus cultures were investigated. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) identified many unique aromatic compounds along with precursor aliphatic molecules. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy identified various minerals differentially distributed between different particles. The particles were strikingly fluorescent, especially in the presence of certain dyes, including neutral red dye. They were also occasionally ferromagnetic, including several particles, which contained no EDX detectable iron, nickel or cobalt. The particles also showed electron donating and electrostatic activities. When placed into water, the particles could lead to the slow development of vapor bubbles. The particle containing cultures also showed the continuing production of lipid-like structures, even after there were no remaining living cells. The structures ranged in appearance from long, narrow trough-like needles to membranous sheets, with the additional occasional formation of more solid crystals and pyramids [11]. The particles and fibers that mediate cellular recovery were termed ACE pigments [11]. This term was chosen because of their notable energy transducing properties and because of the common black coloration of the particles and the range of colors of the fibers, including blue, orange and red. Similar fluorescing, electrostatic and occasionally ferromagnetic materials were identified on the skin and attached to the hair of stealth virus infected patients [17]. The particles and fibers appeared to form from dried perspiration and could be evoked by taking a hot bath before sleeping. Particles could later be collected off the bed sheets. Other patients mistakenly identified the particles and fibers as living parasites and sought medical help. In some situations, this unfortunately led to the unwarranted diagnosis of delusional parasitosis [18]. The pronounced production of these materials in some patients is also being referred to as Morgellon's disease [19]. As discussed next, ACE pigments are also found in association with conventional virus infection, including herpes viruses. Neutral Red Dye Phototherapy of Herpes The relevance of the enhanced fluorescence seen with ACE pigments plus neutral red dye became apparent upon learning of a procedure developed in the early 1970's of applying neutral red dye to herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin lesions and illuminating with fluorescent white light [20]. Although, the procedure had been abandoned by mainstream medicine because of the reported failure of replication [21], an optometrist Dr. Stoneburner, was successfully using the method in conjunction with ultraviolet (UV) light. The fluorescent white light used in the original study probably contained a UV component, which was not present in the incandescent white light used in the failed replication study. Other differences between the studies included the use of autoclaved and stored neutral red dye rather than freshly prepared dye as used in the original study and by Dr. Stoneburner. Of special interest, Dr. Stoneburner had observed that the dye-treated herpes skin lesion would fluoresce under UV illumination. In collaborative studies, the expedited healing routinely observed by Dr. Stoneburner was confirmed. Moreover, in patients with multiple HSV lesions, applying neutral red dye to one of the lesions would lead to healing of distant lesions, which would also fluoresce if directly examined under a UV light during the healing process. Remarkable benefits were also obtained in protocols developed by Dr. Stoneburner and verified by the author for the treatment of recurrent herpes zoster virus (HZV) infections (shingles) and human papillomavirus (HPV) induced warts [22,23]. To better understand the underlying mechanism of action and to avoid the possible mutagenicity of neutral red directly interacting with viruses, the dye was used in conjunction with a water solution, containing Lidocaine plus ethanol extracts (tinctures) of various herbal products. The herbal products were chosen from among the various products disclosed as being used in the manufacture of Enercel, HANSI and Canova (a related homeopathic product from Brazil). Neutral red dye sprinkled onto the formulated solution showed dramatic kinetic activity as the particles dissolved and the resulting solution was highly fluorescent when illuminated with UV light. The solution was sprayed onto neutral red dye soaked paper towels laid over HSV skin lesions and under a UV light. This procedure again led to direct UV inducible fluorescence, with expedited healing, of the underlying skin lesion. This occurred even when using intervening paper towels that completely blocked light transmission. Neutral Red Dye Phototherapy of Autism The phototherapy procedure was adapted to treating children with autism [24]. As noted above, autism is among the many non-inflammatory neuropsychiatric illnesses occurring in patients from whom stealth adapted viruses have been regularly cultured. Very encouraging, highly beneficial clinical improvements were reported in autistic children being treated by their initially skeptical parents. The studies were coordinated by a Canadian father of a 4-year-old autistic boy who had been experiencing recurrent, daily epileptic seizures in spite of therapy. The seizures were severe with occasional residual paralysis. The seizures accounted for 6 of the 9 hospital admissions for the child over the preceding 5 months. The other admissions were for vomiting and dehydration. All epileptic seizure activity ceased upon the initial treatment, which was repeated over 5 days. The child was subsequently taken off anti-seizure medication. He progressed well beyond the goals of his Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy, which was also discontinued as the child began to speak. The therapy evoked transient UV skin fluorescence, occurring not only under the regions where the UV fluorescing towels had been applied but also at some distant sites [24]. For reasons not understood at the time, parents expecting to see the benefits reported by other parents became discouraged when they saw no improvements in their own child. Under Government pressure, the scope of the studies was scaled back to better understand the loss of activity. Working with the mother of an autistic teenager, striking benefits were again achievable, especially with certain Lidocaine containing herbal formulations. A simpler protocol was to place the solution into Ziploc bags loosely attached to the sole of one or both feet and apply UV illumination for around 30 minutes. A systemic effect could be confirmed by observing for intra-oral UV fluorescence developing or increasing during the therapy. The procedure was clinically effective, as judged by the mother and acknowledged by her daughter, even when black plastic was placed between the skin and the Ziploc bag. Decreased Surface Tension and Increased Volatility of Activated Fluids As noted earlier, neutral red dye sprinkled onto water showed differing dissolving patterns ranging from essentially static particles with slowly expanding solid red circles to linear streaks of moving particles, often showing to-and-fro movements [25]. Various methods discussed below can change water from showing the static to the more dynamic dissolving patterns. Furthermore, in the more highly activated water, the neutral red dye particles sink below the surface, reflecting the water's reduced surface tension. This is an indication of reduced intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the water molecules, which would be expected to lead to increase volatility. This could in turn lead to the loss of the more kinetically active water molecules and could explain the reduced efficacy seen over time in the autism study. A robust assay was developed to measure the volatility of water [26]. It is based on the measured weight loss in closed but not completely sealed containers. It was interesting that the increased volatility of active solutions was maintained over long periods (over a year) indicative of a continuing activation process [26]. The increased volatility was also noted in heat-sealed regions of Ziploc containing activated ethanol in water solutions, with or without added neutral red dye. Over a period of months, the bags would expand with a pressure clearly greater than atmospheric pressure, even to the point of bursting. This effect again pointed to a continuing activation process, presumably from the absorption of an external energy [26]. Methods and Proposed Mechanism of Water Activation The weight loss assay was used to further investigate ways of activating water. The two basic approaches are to either add compounds to the water or to place the water within certain energy fields [9]. As detailed in other publications, the water activating compounds are generally characterized by being dipolar, i.e., the compounds have separated electrical charges. The still relatively few active compounds actually tested can be variously classified, including into the following groupings: i) Mineral rich products commonly used as soil amendments by farmers. ii) Certain pharmaceuticals with reported clinical benefits beyond their known biochemical activity. iii) Various foods with reported major health benefits along with herbal tinctures commonly used in homeopathy. iv) Several gases v) Previously activated water. The last item is relevant to the preparations of homeopathic remedies [27]. Initially added water activating tinctures can be diluted beyond detection because activation occurs in the water used in the repeated dilutions. Similarly, water activation is not dependent upon the continuing presence of compounds in the earlier categories. Those that are pelleted or in granular form can be easily removed from the activated water, especially if they are placed within a container. Alternatively, the water can be decanted away from the pellets or granules. Soluble compounds can be removed by zero residue filtration, while gases readily escape. Nor is it necessary to actually add compounds to the water to be activated, since some compounds can also work by creating a water activating energy field. To help explain these energy fields, it is useful to summarize the current model for how the various compounds are thought to be activating water. As noted above, many of the water activating compounds are characterized by having separated electrical charges. Heating to relatively high temperatures can increase the electrostatic (electrical charge separation) property of some of the compounds, including finely ground humic acid and volcanic rock. ACE pigment particles also displayed rather remarkable and reversible electrostatic properties. These and other considerations led to a natural energy force being proposed and tentatively called KELEA (kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction). The force may serve the essential function of preventing the fusion of opposite electrical charges as they become increasing electrostatically attracted to one another. KELEA would attach to the separated charges on dipolar molecules. Certain of these molecules could presumably be slightly altered by the KELEA in a manner that releases the attached KELEA. Regular or ordinary water does not naturally attract KELEA, presumably because its electrical charges are masked by very rapid intermolecular hydrogen bonding. If increased levels of KELEA are available, momentary freed electrical charges can be engaged by KELEA leading to a loosening of subsequent hydrogen bonding to other water molecules. Once it is sufficiently activated, the less structured water can act as its own antenna to attract KELEA and even transfer energy to nearby water. This would explain the ability to progressively dilute activated water in the production of homeopathic remedies. It is also likely that KELEA can be lost from water, for example it may be utilized in abiotic synthesis of organic molecules. It is probable that relatively tight intermolecular bonding of water is required for transporting water to the upper branches of tall trees. KELEA Fields The attraction of KELEA to isolated electrical charges is also consistent with concentrating regions of KELEA within the vicinity of devices with rapid on-off electrical switching. Many purported medical benefits have been obtained using such devices. Prominent examples include the violet lamp of Edgar Cayce, the beam ray of Royal Raymond Rife, the multi-wave oscillator of Lakhovsky and the papimi machine of Panos Papas. It is likely that the sudden release of KELEA explains the radiant or impulse energy proposed by Nikola Tesla [28]. It is also consistent with the Odic energy described by Karl von Reichenbach [29]. Although clearly without any direct support, the author has inquired from physicists whether KELEA could be carried by cosmic rays or linked to the expansion of the universe, normally attributed to dark energy. There is no factual basis to exclude such a possibility. Indeed, consideration of a possible role of cosmic ray carried KELEA in the formation of cloud condensation nuclei is worthy of attention by climatologists. Using water activation as the measure, the author has provided evidence for a concentrated KELEA field in the vicinity of direct current transmitted through regular coiled electrical wires [30]. This arrangement, similar to the bifilar coils of Tesla, was intended to force positive and negative electrical charges towards each other. If so, this would attract additional input of KELEA. A water activating KELEA field effect was also generated using diagonal facing LED traffic lights, with an overhead flashing strobe light [31]. This arrangement was designed to help explain the reported benefits of therapy rooms with opposing computers, supposedly transmitting healing messages. Other methods of water activation have ranged from the simplicity of merely placing a closed capsule of activated water into a larger volume of regular water to the complexity of using a high voltage van de Graaff generator on which steam is allowed to condense. It is likely that different technologies will be chosen depending upon the available time and the level of required activation for medical, agricultural or industrial applications. Before discussing potential medical applications of KELEA activated water, it is useful to briefly review photosynthesis and food metabolism as sources of cellular energy and the situations in which these sources may be deficient. Cellular Energy Production: From Photosynthesis to Food Metabolism It had been assumed that sunlight was the primary source of all cellular energy via chlorophyll mediated photosynthesis in plants and in certain bacteria [32]. Electromagnetic energy from the sun is able to release electrons from the hydrogen atoms in water and to further generate carbohydrates and oxygen using carbon dioxide. Electrostatic attraction of free electrons is also used to drive the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from its precursors. The metabolism, or reconversion of carbohydrates back to carbon dioxide and water can yield additional ATP, which provides the major source of chemical energy for the biosynthesis of organic molecules, as well as for most cellular functions. The energy based mechanisms leading to the initial formation of the primordial precursors of chlorophyll and electron transporting organic molecules have yet to be elucidated. It is noteworthy that bacteria can be a source of ACE pigments [33] and that abiotic biosynthesis of lipids was seen with ACE pigments derived from patients [17]. Abiotic lipid synthesis also occurred in long term cultures of stealth adapted viruses in which there were ACE pigments but no remaining cells [11]. The energy of organic molecules can be expressed as the amount of heat generated upon their combustion. It is measured as calories, with carbohydrates, protein and fats being able to generate 4, 4 and 9 calories per gram, respectively [34]. With cellular metabolism, only a relatively small amount of energy from foods is actually converted to heat, with most of the energy going into the synthesis of ATP and other organic molecules. With the exception of proteins, in which loss of some chemical energy occurs with the excretion of urea, most of the chemical energy used for biosynthesis is regained when the molecules are recycled back to carbon dioxide and water [34]. A typical human diet may contain approximately 2,000 kilocalories (expressed as Calories with a capital C). For each degree centigrade that the body temperature is maintained above that of the environment, the body requires daily Calories equivalent to the body's weight in kilograms. With the additional Calories required for work effort, such as muscular activity, it is unrealistic to consider 2,000 Calories being adequate for daily human activities. (This amount of energy is equivalent to a tenth of a gallon of gasoline). Along with the evidence reviewed earlier in this article, it seems necessary for the body to have an ACE pathway. If photosynthesis is referred to as Nature's first energy pathway and food metabolism as its second, then the ACE pathway can be regarded as Nature's third energy pathway. It is logical that enhancing the ACE would be useful in compensation for human illnesses in which inadequate cellular energy is available from the metabolism of food. Medical Conditions with an Insufficiency of Cellular Energy (ICE) These illnesses can be placed into 5 broad categories. The first is an inadequate supply of oxygen. The prime example is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The second category is impaired blood supply, as in coronary heart disease. A third category refers to overall inefficiencies in metabolic pathways, with the prime example being diabetes. The fourth category is for increased energy demands, as can occur with infections and during wound healing. The fifth and most interesting category is based on the proposal that the ACE pathway contributes to certain brain activities in a manner that is not provided by the regular metabolism of food. It is further suggested that energy deficiency is an underrlying cause of cancer and aging. A brief discussion justifying the experimental clinical testing of KELEA activated water in many diverse clinical circumstances follows. Neuropsychiatric Illnesses Brain dysfunction is generally viewed as being either neurologic or psychiatric. The former can more or less be attributed to structural changes at definable locations within the nervous system. This results in easily discernable impairments in motor, sensory and to some extent autonomic functions. Psychiatric disorders are impairments of the more complex brain processes that regulate mood, cognition and behavior. An aspect of psychiatric disorders appears to relate to an overall heightened brain activity, which limits the attention required for conscious self-awareness, staying focused and achieving directed memory recall. The coordination and regulation that is required for higher levels of brain activity are seemingly prone to being disrupted by distracting emotions and/or thoughts. An analogy exists with epilepsy being an extreme example of the motor functions of brain being distracted by unintended activity elsewhere in the brain. This novel explanation for psychiatric disorders is consistent with the feedback offered by patients within a psychiatric facility. Emotional and thought over-activity can also lead to a sense of exhaustion from which some drug addicts seek relief through their addiction. It is becoming recognized that dysfunctional brain activity may also be an underlying determining factor in many systemic diseases. This can occur through the brain's regulation of the autonomic nervous system. An impaired brain may lose some of its normal functional buffering capacity, such that it over reacts to normally tolerated inputs with increased and inappropriate sympathetic responses. The effects can be on the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, genitourinary and endocrine systems. It can also be reflected in increased perception of pain from various locations, including the spine. With regards to increases in brain driven sympathetic overload, it is clearly preferable to improve the regulatory functions of the brain through enhancing cellular energy, then to impose an overall reduction in either the alpha or beta sympathetic system using drugs. Similarly, it is preferable to avoid peripheral surgery if patients experiencing inappropriate, excessive pain can become asymptomatic by achieving a lower pain threshold. The role of stealth adapted viruses in the genesis of many neuropsychiatric disorders is still under appreciated [35,36]. Contributing to Public Health disregard of these viruses was the early report that some had originated from African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV) [37]. Acknowledging these viruses raises questions regarding the government's inadequate response to a 1972 report that monkey kidney cultures otherwise intended to produce polio vaccines, showed SCMV contamination [38]. Rhesus cytomegalovirus contamination has been documented in the CHAT experimental polio vaccines tested in chimpanzees [39]. The author considers it likely that this contaminated vaccine was instrumental in the conversion of chimpanzee immunodeficiency virus to HIV [40]. The tragedy of disregarding stealth adapted viruses is that they may render individuals prone to vaccine induced reactivation of stealth adapted viruses or more likely to activation of immune reactivity to residual minor antigenic targets on these viruses [41]. Enhancing the ACE pathway provides the best approach to the suppression of stealth adapted virus infections. The cortical electrical pulses observed in the electroencephalogram (EEG) and also occurring elsewhere in the brain are commonly assumed to be directed information signaling between areas of the brain. A more intriguing possibility is that the normal fluctuating electrical activity of the brain is actually acting as an antenna for KELEA [42]. The attracted KELEA could help in maintaining the relatively high resting membrane electrical potential of most neuronal cells and help lead to less unwanted and distracting neuronal activity. The brain attracted KELEA could also be transferred to the body's fluids, resulting in increased dynamic (kinetic) activity of the fluids. Water samples taken to a laughing yoga class definitively became activated [42]. The proposed antenna function of the brain, and possibly also of the heart may well vary in their efficiency and this capacity could correlate with wellness. It may also be possible to render this antenna function more effective through meditation and other thought processes and also through the consumption of KELEA activated water. With regards to clinical therapy data on neurological illnesses, a preliminary report has been published on the improvements in two patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using Enercel injected into acupuncture points [43]. Electro-acupuncture has also been shown successful in patients with diverse neuropsychiatric illnesses and may directly enhance the ACE pathway. Infections Mainstream medicine is encountering the prospect of pathogenic bacteria becoming genetically resistance to all available antibiotics. Moreover, many of the commonly used antibiotics primarily directed against pathogenic bacteria, are also lethal for some of the normally resident bacteria in humans. These resident or commensal bacteria play a significant role in human health, both by competing with more harmful pathogens and by supplying some essential metabolites. In an early study, two intramuscular injections of Enercel were markedly effective in suppressing acute tropical diarrhea in children [44]. This is a common illness in developing countries and is mostly attributed to bacteria with some cases being caused by rotavirus. Enercel was effective with both bacterial and viral diarrhea. Added cellular energy likely increases the fluid resorption by gastrointestinal cells and contributes to the cells' resistance to bacterial and/or virus damage. Tuberculosis (TB) is the bacterial infection that kills more people yearly than any other infection including HIV. Extremely encouraging results have been obtained using Enercel as the sole therapy in newly diagnosed drug sensitive TB infected individuals [45]. Enercel also showed significant benefit in patients with severe disease caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) TB. A major determination of resistance to TB resides in the failure of energy requiring bacteriocidal capacity of the various subsets of macrophages. This critical capacity is probably enhanced by Enercel through the ACE pathway. Enercel has also been shown to suppress HIV levels and to increase CD4 lymphocytes and the quality of life in patients who agreed to forego regular anti-retroviral therapy for 4 months [46]. The outcome was considered far better than that in patients only receiving anti-retroviral drugs. These findings add to the earlier reported success in the therapy of herpes and papillomavirus infections by enhancing the ACE pathway. Additional support for a beneficial role of activated water in infectious diseases has come from agricultural studies employing a water activating method termed Kiko Technology. Cartridges of pellets that form upon the cooling of heated, finely grounded volcanic rock are inserted into the soil at approximately one per half-acre. Beyond the increased overall productivity seen with rice and sugarcane crops, when directly compared with control fields, there were several examples of the treated crops showing increased resistance to infection. The examples included far milder tungo virus infection in treated rice and an absence of Downy mildew in the treated sugarcane [47]. In separate unpublished studies, KELEA activated water prepared using yucca plant and kelp was highly effective in suppressing pink rot fungal disease in palm trees. These later studies were interesting in that the activated water also led to relative increases in aerobic bacteria, which may be natural competitors of the fungal growth. It is also possible that activated water inactivates certain fungal toxins by disrupting some of their critical intra-molecular and/or intermolecular hydrogen bonding [48]. Cancer Many cancers can be considered as cells with insufficient energy to either proceed through the normal maturation process or to undergo apoptosis. Their proliferation can be in response to a metabolic or energy deficiency, with efforts to seek the missing component(s) elsewhere through migration (metastasis). As recently reported Enercel can be effective in reversing cancer [49] as can some other modalities of CAM. A striking feature of Enercel induced tumor regression is that it is painless. This is consistent with apoptosis as the tumor killing mechanism, since unlike cell death from radiation and chemotherapy, apoptosis is not accompanied by inflammation. The emerging development of immunotherapy for cancer also has to address the issue of likely painful inflammation and cytokine storms [50]. Aging Exhaustion of the mitochondria pathway of cellular energy production has long been viewed as contributing to normal aging and senescence. Age related cellular damage presumably also requires ongoing repair to not reach a threshold from which death is inevitable. Enhancing the ACE pathway can potentially help compensate for limitations in mitochondria function and in cellular repair. Empirical support for water contributing to human longevity is provided from certain locations in the world where the local water is considered to be naturally activated. Such locations 25]. Support for delayed senescence achievable with activated water has also come from unpublished observations of extended growth cycles in both sugarcane and rice plants irrigated with activated water. < Importance of Continued Clinical Trials A major strength of pharmaceutical medicine has been its reliance on well controlled clinical trials. CAM practitioners have largely refrained from conducting rigorous clinical studies. This has been partly due to reluctance to disclose technical details, e.g., exact formulation of homeopathic remedies to regulatory authorities. It also arises from a lack of understanding of the actual healing mechanism involved with trite assumptions of \"boosting the immune system\" or \"destroying free radicals\" without any compelling data. Many reports of apparent benefits in CAM do not distinguish between a specific biological action of the treating modality and benefits from induced optimism created in the patient by the treating physician. Homeopaths still maintain specificity of the various formulations, yet no convincing data have been presented to validate the often quoted \"Law of Similars\" [51]. Enercel is an example of a product that is still referred to as being a homeopathic formulation, although effective homeopathy is probably a misnomer for KELEA activated water [49]. The published clinical data show Enercel to be beneficial in diverse illnesses, including cancer, ALS, TB, HIV and childhood diarrhea [43-46,49]. It provides a proven modality with which to compare other preparations of activated water. Water with different levels of activation can be prepared for clinical studies using various activation methods. So too can the different means of creating KELEA fields be compared in the treating of patients with various diseases. Enhancing the ACE pathway, expressed as increased kinetic activity of the body's fluids, provides a unifying theme for conducting clinical studies using different modalities [52]. Methods are available for quantifying the ACE pathway in patients before, during and after therapy. The international Journal of Complementary & Alternative Medicine could become a useful repository for ACE pathway related clinical studies. Summary Medical science can benefit from a better appreciation of the complex biophysical processes that are involved in many cellular activities. Energy is the most fundamental requirement for cell survival and proper functioning. Adequate cellular energy may enable cells to adapt in ways that are still not well understood, to various metabolic, microbial and toxic challenges so as to minimize or actually prevent disease from occurring. An important insight into cellular energy is that it is not fully dependent on food metabolism. The body can acquire energy from a natural force termed KELEA (kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction). This energy is expressed as a dynamic (kinetic) quality of the body's fluids. It is referred to as the third or the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway. Enhancing the ACE pathway by either administering KELEA activated water or creating KELEA fields can have therapeutic benefits. The task is to more fully document such benefits through well conducted clinical trials.
