Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 2 Study title : Infections through 6 months of age among infants born to women who received COVID -19 vaccination while pregnant or breastfeeding Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 3 Protocol summary: This study will use the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) to investigate the safety of maternal COVID -19 vaccination administered in pregnancy and in the postpartum period up to 6 weeks after delivery while breastfeeding on infant infectious outcomes through 6 months of life . Background: It is estimated that >150,000 pregnant women in the United States (US)1 have contracted coronaviru s disease 2019 (COVID -19), caused by the respiratory pathogen , severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV-2). Approximately 5% of women in the US of reproductive age are expected to be pregnant or postpartum at any given time . Therefore, the burden of COVID -19 in pregnant and postpartum women is anticipated to increase in the setting of the ongoing pandemic . Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe illness due to COVID -19 and may be at increased risk for adverse birth outcomes including preterm birth and stillbirth .2-4 Pregnant and lactating women have historically been excluded from clinical vaccine trials, and similarly, initial trials for COVID -19 vaccine did not include pregnant wome n.5 While there are now clinical trials enrolling pregnant women ,6,7 safety data are not yet available to guide critical policy decisions. Initial developmental and reproductive toxicity (DART) studies on Pfizer -BioNTech BNT162b2 and Moderna mRNA -1273 vaccines in animals have not shown adverse effects with respect to pregnancy, fetal development, parturition or postnatal development .8,9 Additionally, p reliminary surveillance data have shown no safety signals regarding birth outcomes in women who received mRNA COVID -19 vaccines in pregnancy.10-12 Given data from currently licensed maternal vaccin es,13 infant protection from maternal COVID -19 vaccination through transplacental antibody transfer or mucosal immunity through breastfeeding may be hypothesized; however, it is paramount to ensure no adverse effects to the developing infant as a result. Known risks of COVID -19 infection for pregnant and lactating women and their infants make the evaluation of the safety profile of maternal COVID -19 vaccination s critical to inform evidence -based assessment of the risks and benefits of COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy and lactation. Vaccine safety data in pregnant populations is often limited due to lack of pre -licensure clinical vaccine trials . Reactogenicity and safety profiles are often evaluated in the post -licensure period using passive methods, which may be limited by small sample sizes and inadequate study design.14 Population -based data systems, such as the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD), a collaborative effort between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and nine partner healthcare organizations, provide s useful information about the safety of maternal vaccination that can be used to inform regulatory and policy decisions surrounding maternal immunization.15,16 The VSD can successfully identify pregnancy episodes using a Pregnancy Episode Algorithm (PEA)16 and has evaluate d the safety of maternal influenza and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and acellular pertussis (Tdap ) vaccines , given during pregnancy on infant outcomes.17 The PEA has recently been adapted to a Dynamic Pregnancy Algorithm (DPA) which can identify pregnancy episodes in real time, a tool necessary given the need for real time data in the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic.18 To that end, the VSD provides an opportunity to plan systematic data collection of indicators of safety among infants born to women who received COVID -19 vaccination during pregnanc y. Initial recommendations from CDC for phased allocation of COVID -19 vaccine rollout included health care personnel, with estimates that approximately 330,000 could be pregnant or recently postpartum at the time of vaccination , as well as those with high risk medical conditions including pregnancy. 19 20 Currently CDC recommends pregnant women receive COVID -19 vaccination due to the increased risk of severe illness due to COVID -19 and while it is not known exactly how many pregnant or postpartum women in the US have re ceived COVID -19 vaccination, recent VSD data from 14 December 2020 through 8 May 2021 identified 135,968 pregnant women with 22,197 (16.3%) of these who had received 1 dose of a COVID -19 vaccine during Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 4 pregnancy .21 Further, r ecent estimates show that >178,000 participants in v -safe, a novel, active , web -based surveillance system implemented by CDC have indicated they were pregnant at t he time of vaccination.22 CDC is currently evaluating maternal and neonatal safety outcomes in pregnant women who received COVID -19 vaccination, including , in regard to fetal and neonatal outcomes, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, prematurity, low birth weight, and neonatal death. The Global Alignment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy (GAIA), an initiative of the Brighton Collaboration, has ide ntified priority outcomes to assess the safety of maternal vaccination s.23 In addition to those outcomes already being evaluated by CDC, the GAIA initiative calls out neonatal infections as an area of priority.24 These outcomes, including neonatal infections, have also been highlighted as critical for safety evaluation in maternal COVID -19 vaccination.25 While it has been shown that maternal antibodies interfere with the infant immune response to vaccination in early life,26 another mechanism of biologic plausibility which may lead to an increase in infections after COVID -19 vaccination in pregnancy or while lactating has not been postulated. Looking at similar data from maternal influenza vaccination, Hviid et al. found a statistically significant increased risk for sepsis and \"other infections\" in a cohort of Danish children exposed to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccination in pregnancy during a 5 -year follow up period; multiple testing was hypothesized as an explanation for the increased risk , and when using the Bonferroni correction, the increased risk for sepsis and \"other infections \" was not observed.27 Additionally, a significant decrease in upper respiratory and gastrointestinal infections was found in this cohort .27 Further da ta that exist to evaluate infections in infants exposed to maternal influenza vaccination beyond the neonatal period do not suggest an increase in infectious infant adverse outcomes.28,29 Nevertheless, it is necessary to ensure there are no safety concerns regarding infant infection s following maternal COVID -19 vaccination, given the complex interaction of maternal antibodies with infant immune response, novel mRNA vaccination platforms , and the historic inclusion of pregnant women early in vaccine rollout. The unprecedented inclusion of pregnant and postpartum women in early COVID -19 vaccine rollout will yield a rich dataset to evaluate infectious safety outcomes of infants born to women who received COVID -19 vaccination while pregnant or postpartum and to impact health policy decisions. Specific aims: Aim 1: Evaluate the association of maternal COVID -19 vaccine exposure during pregnancy with medically attended adverse infant infectious outcomes through 1 month and 6 months of life . Approach : Identify inpatient, emergency department (ED) , and outpatient encounter s for respiratory infections (e.g., COVID -19 infection , pneumonia, bronchiolitis , other upper or lower respiratory illness ), bacteremia and sepsis, and meningitis in the infant to evaluate association with maternal COVID -19 vaccination in pregnancy . Aim 2: Evaluate the association of maternal COVID -19 vaccine administration in the postpartum period up to 6 weeks after delivery in women who are breastfeeding with medically attended adverse infant infectious outcomes through 1 month and 6 months of life (exploratory) . Approach: Identify inpatient, ED, and outpatient encounters for respiratory infections (e.g., COVID -19 infection, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, other upper or lower respiratory illness), bacteremia and sepsis, and meningitis to evaluate association with maternal COVID -19 vaccination given in the 6 weeks after delivery while breastfeeding . Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 5 Methods and analysis plan : Figure 1: Characteristics of the study cohort including pregnancy start dates, pregnancy completion dates, COVID -19 vaccine exposure dates and infant outcome dates for each aim . Aim 1: Evaluate the association of maternal COVID -19 vaccine exposure during pregnancy with medically attended adverse infant infect ious outcomes through 1 month and 6 months of life . Study design, population , and period : A retrospective observational cohort study utilizing automated data obtained through the VSD of p regnant women 16-49 years of age with pregnancy start dates within the study period, May 10, 2020 to October 25, 2020 will be completed . Rates of adverse infectious outcomes of infants born to women exposed to one or more COVID -19 vaccine doses during pregnancy from December 15, 2020 to August 4, 2021 will be compared to rates for these outcomes in women with pregnancies during the same time period who did not receive a COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy or postpartum (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria: - Women aged 1 6-49 years who were pregnant within the study period and continuously enrolled from 6 months prior to pregnancy and through 2 months after pregnancy end or 2 months prior to the end of the study period - Women with a completed singleton live birth pregnan cy, linked to an infant record - Women with at least one antenatal , delivery or postpartum care visit - Infants enrolled in the first 3 months of life and at least 3 months of enrollment in the first 6 months of life who have at least one well child visit . Exclusion criteria: - Pregnancies with the following outcomes: ectopic pregnancy, therapeutic abortion, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, gestational trophoblastic disease or unknown pregnancy outcome - Multiple gestation pregnancies - Pregnancies that are ongoing at the time of the data pull - Pregnancies in which the mother received a COVID -19 vaccine postpartum - Infants without any well child encounters during the study period, suggesting they may be receiving care outside of the health s ystem . Exposure definition: The primary exposure of interest is receipt of one or more doses of COVID -19 vaccination during pregnancy . COVID -19 vacci nation status will be identified using vaccine administered codes (Table 1) . COVID -19 vaccine exposed will be defined as receiving one or more COVID -19 vaccines during any trimester of pregnancy and before the date of delivery. COVID -19 vaccine unexposed will be defined as receiving no COVID - Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 6 19 vaccine during pregnancy, through date of delivery and in the postpartum period . COVID -19 vaccine exposed and COVID -19 vaccine unexposed will be compared for analysis. Table 1: Vaccine -administered CVX codes for VACCINE FILE youth and adult cohorts from Vaccine Safety Datalink Data Dict ionary 2020. Identification of pregnant women and infants : We will use the VSD dynamic pregnancy algorithm (DPA) to identify pregnant women with pregnancy start dates (or last menstrual period (LMP)) between May 10, 2020 and October 25, 2020. Mother -infant dyads will be identified, and o nly live births will be included . Infant records will be identified through internal linkages to maternal pregnan cy records. Outcome measures: The International Classification of Disease, Tenth (ICD -10) Revision, Clinical Modification codes as well as laboratory records will be used to identify outcome parameters (Table 2) . Infant infectious health outcomes will be assessed for each pregnancy id entified , linked to an infant record . Outcomes of interest include infant first and total encounters for infections including inpatient, ED and outpatient respiratory infections (COVID -19 infection, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) , bacterial or viral pneumonia, bronchiolitis, other upper or lower respiratory illness ), bloodstream infections (bacteremia, bacterial sepsis, or culture -negative sepsis ), and meningitis, viral meningitis, and culture -negative meningitis ). We will plan to assess the number of independent events as well as the total number of encounters to assess health care utilization in the same child. Additionally, outcomes in the first month of life will be limited to inpati ent and ED encounters to distinguish true infections. Outpatient respiratory outcomes will be treated as a secondary analysis , and data will be examined for those from 30 days to 6 months of life to determine feasibility of this analysis. Outcomes will be analyzed separately and as a composite to assess for association.

Descriptive statistics will be reported in univariate analyses using means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous data and counts and percentage for categorical data. Rates of infant infectious outcomes will be computed (Table 4). Association of receipt of COVID -19 vaccine and events in the intervals, 0 -30 days of life and 1 -6 months of life for each of the infectious outcomes will be reported as incidence rate ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals after applying inverse probability weights. (Table 4). An offset will be used to account for differences in follow up time. Statistical significance will be set at a p-value of 0.05.

The standardized differences for each covariate will be calculated by dividing the mean difference between the two groups by the estimate of the common standard deviation. The propensity score to rec eive a COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy will be calculated based on known char acteristics using logistic regression and potential confounding variables including pregnancy start date, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, other maternal vaccines received during pregnancy, maternal comorbidities, state - or county -level of positive COVID -19 test results30 and VSD site. Inverse probability weighting: Stabilized inverse probability weighting will be generated . The ability of the stabilized weights to reduce potential confounding will be determined by applying the weights to the cohort and estimating the sta ndardized difference for each covariate. Standardized differences will be evaluated before and after applying stabilized weights for observed confounders . Assuming positivity for the study, it will be ensured that propensity scores are between zero and one , there is no clustering around zer o or one and distribution of the propensity on the comparator group will be evaluated .If the positivity assumption does not hold, sensitivity analysis will be performed. Additional assumptions will need to be made using this approach, including exchangability and consistency. The unvaccinated cohort will represent the unexposed status of the fully vaccinated cohort, assuming no unmeasured confounders. We will count the exposure as having received one or more vaccine s during the study period. Therefore, partial and full vaccination status will both be considered exposure. Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 9 Power analysis : Preliminary data indicate that there are approximately 50,000 participants in the VSD cohort of pregnant women in our study period with approximately 20% vaccine coverage during pregnancy . A 30% attrition rate was applied as a modest estimate of availability of infant data. The event rate for events in the first 6 months of life was set at 25 per 100 for respiratory infections, 10 per 10,000 for bloodstream infections and 1 per 10,000 for meningitis. Minimum detectable differences are presented below for risk ratios assuming alpha of 0.05 and power of 80% (Table 5). Estimates were computed using Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS) 2019 software .

Kaysville, Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pass. Aim 2: Evaluate the association of maternal COVID -19 vaccine administration in the postpartum period up to 6 weeks after delivery in women who are breastfeeding with medically attended adverse infant infectious outcomes through 1 month and 6 months of lif e (exploratory) . Study design, population and period: A retrospective observational matched cohort study utilizing automated data obtained through the VSD will be performed . Mother -infant dyads of pregnant women 16 -49 years of age and their infants will be identified from the source cohort with infant dates of birth from December 15, 2020 to August 4, 2021 who breastfed . Rates of adverse infectious outcomes of infants born to women exposed to one or more CO VID-19 vaccine doses while breastfeeding will be compared to rates for these outcomes in women with pregnancies during the same time period who did not receive a COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy or while breastfeeding (Figure 1). Inclusion criteria: - Mother -infant dyads including w omen aged 16 -49 years who had a completed singleton live birth pregnancy during the study period, linked to an infant record - Women with at least one postnatal care visit or infants with at least one well child visit - Mother -infant dyads who were identified to be breastfeeding during the study period ( breastfeeding status will be assessed by postnatal care or infant well child encounter using ICD -10, DXID codes or other internal codes for breastfeedin g) - Infants enrolled in the first 3 months of life and at least 3 months of enrollment in the first 6 months of life who have at least one well child visit. Exclusion criteria: - Pregnancies with the following oucomes: non-live birt h and multiple gestation - Pregnancies in which the mother received a COVID -19 vaccine during pregnancy - Infants without any well child encounters during the study period, suggesting they may be receiving care outside of the health system.

An index date will be assigned in order to match vaccinated and unvaccinated dyads. The index date will be the vaccination date for the exposed dyad. Exposure definition: The primary exposure of interest is receipt of one or more doses of COVID -19 vaccin ation given during the postpartum period to breastfeeding women . COVID -19 vaccination will be identified using vaccine administered codes (Table 1). COVID -19 vaccine exposed will be defined as receiving one or more COVID -19 vaccines during the postpartum p eriod while breastfeeding. COVID -19 vaccine unexposed will be defined as lack of receipt of COVID -19 vaccination in the postpartum period while breastfeeding and lack of COVID -19 vaccination given during pregnancy. COVID -19 vaccine exposed and COVID -19 vac cine unexposed will be compared for analysis. Chart review: A sample manual chart review o f DXID , ICD-10 codes , such as Z39.1 , and other internal codes for breastfeeding status to ensure that automated data codes represent true incident diagnosis will be completed . Charts for infants who are and are not receiving breastmilk according to automated codes will be reviewed to ensure a representative sample and accuracy of these codes. Approximately 100 chart reviews will be completed divided between p articipating VSD sites with available breastfeeding data , for approximately 20 chart reviews per site (Form 1). Identification of pregnant women: We will use the VSD DPA to identify women who were pregnant and had a live birth pregnancy outcome infant date of birth between December 15, 2020 to August 4, 2021 . Mother -infant dyads will be identified , and only live births will be included. Of the women with live birth singleton pregnancies and infants born within the study period , data on breastfeeding status will be extracted . Outcome measures: ICD-10 codes as well as laboratory records will be used to identify outcome parameters (Table 2). Outcomes of interest include first and total infant encounters for infections including inpatient, emergency department and outpatient respiratory infections (COVID -19 infection, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bacterial or viral pneumonia, bronchiolitis, other upper or lower respiratory illness ), bloodstream infections (bacteremia, bacterial sepsis, or culture -negative sepsis ), and meningitis, viral meningitis, and culture -negative meningitis ). We will plan to assess the number of independent events as well as the total number of encounters to examine health care utilization in the same child. Additionally, any outcomes in the first month of life will be limited to inpatient and ED encounters to distinguish true infections. Outpatient respiratory out comes will be treated as a secondary analysis , and data will be examined for those from 30 days to 6 months of life to determine feasibility of analysis. Outcomes will be analyzed separately and as a composite to assess for association. COVID -19 vaccination must precede the infectious outcome . Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to describe variables of interest including demographics of pregnant women, information surrounding maternal COVID -19 vaccination while breastfeeding, levels of circulating COVID -19, influenza, and RSV using state - or county - level percentages of positive test results30, maternal pre - existing medical conditions, prenatal complications, gestational age , birthweight, and infant medical conditions and routine childhood vaccines received (Table 6). Descriptive statistics will be reported in univariate analyses using means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges for continuous data and counts and percentage for categorical data. Rates of infant infectious outcomes will be computed ( Table 4). Finally, association of receipt of COVID -19 vaccine and events in the intervals, 0 -30 days of life and 1 -6 months of life for each of the infectious outcomes w ill be reported as incidence rate ratios with corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the matched contrast and after applying inverse probability weights. A poisson distribution with robust variance using a generalized estimating equation will be used t o account for the correlation introduced by the matching of the groups exposed and unexposed to COVID -19 vaccine and the introduction of inverse probability weights. We will use the number of follow up days to account for follow up truncation due to receip t Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 11 of COVID -19 vaccine during the first month of life . The first follow up period will be truncated at 30 days of life and the second at 6 months of life or end of study period (Tabl e 4). An offset will be used to account for differences in follow up time.

The standardized differences for each covariate will be calculated by dividing the mean difference between the two groups by the estimate of the common standard deviation. The propensity score to receive a Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 12 COVID -19 vaccine while breastfeeding will be calculated based on known characteristics using logistic regression and potential confounding variables including pregn ancy start date, maternal age, maternal race/ethnicity, other maternal vaccines received during pregnancy or postpartum, maternal comorbidities, SARS -CoV-2 circulation and VSD site. Inverse probability weighting: Stabilized inverse probability weighting will be generated. The ability of the stabilized weights to reduce potential confounding will be determined by applying the weights to the cohort and estimating the standardized difference for each covariate. Standardized differences will be evaluated befo re and after applying stabilized weights for observed confounders. Assuming positivity for the study, it will be ensured that propensity scores are between zero and one, there is no clustering around zero or one and distribution of the propensity on the co mparator group will be evaluated .

The unvaccinated cohort will re present the unexposed status of the fully vaccinated cohort, assuming no unmeasured confounders. We will count the exposure as having received one or more vaccines during the study period. Therefore, partial and full vaccination status will both be conside red exposure. Power analysis: Data from the VSD indicate approximately 50,000 participants in the VSD cohort of pregnant women in our study period with a modest estimate that at least 6,000 likely received one or more doses of COVID -19 vaccination in the postpartum period while breast feeding. A 30% attrition rate was applied as a modest estimate of availability of infant data. The rate for events in the first 6 months of life was set at 25 per 100 for respiratory infections, 10 per 10,000 for bloodstream infections and 1 per 10,000 for meningitis. Minimum detectable differences are presented below for risk ratios assuming alpha of 0.05 and power of 80% (Table 7). Estimates were computed using Power Analysis and Sample Size (PASS ) 2019 software . Table 7: Minimum detectable risk ratios for infant outcomes among infants born to women exposed versus unexposed to COVID -19 vaccination while breastfeeding . NCSS, Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pass. Limitations: As a retrospective cohor t study, data will be limited to that attainable through the VSD. Given the complexity of COVID -19 vaccination rollout, it is possible that some vaccines may be missed , however all VSD sites routinely obtain vaccination data from state and regional immunization information systems . Further, while we plan to confirm our approach to gathering breastfeeding data using chart confirmation of a subset of cases to ensure DXID and ICD-10 codes as well as other internal breastfeeding codes are representative of breastfeeding status , it would not be feasible to confirm every case . Inherent differen ces in women who chose to receive vaccination while pregnant or breastfeeding may exist which we may not be able to account for in our study. This study will also will have limited power to assess rare events. Certain factors such as number of children in the home and daycare status of the child, which is not routinely available in VSD data, may also impact our outcome s of interest. We are only capturing medically attended events, although our outcomes are generally ones that involve outpatient or inpatient encounters. Our study period does not include booster dose administration, so we will be unable to study association of booster doses and our outcome s.

All electronic documents, data sets, and files relevant to the project will be stored on network folders or CDC computers with restricted access. Collaborators at VSD sites will abstract data from medical records and data will be exchanged using methods that will assure security, primarily through the VSD distributed data model (DDM) . The DDM allows all individual level standardized data files to reside at the health plan, and ownership is retained by the VSD site. The DDM maintains confidentiality of the health plan's data by utilizing encrypted and secure methods. CDC will write all relevant SAS code and will share it with participating sites for a pproval prior to data extraction. Plan for human subjects: Risks and benefits: The privacy and confidentiality of study subjects will be strictly protected according to VSD standard procedures. The VSD project is covered by an Assurance of Confidentiality. CDC has obtained an Assurance of Confidentiality under Section 308(d) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 242 m(d)), whi ch provides that this data can only be used for the purpose for which is obtained, unless such institution or individual has consented to that disclosure. Pursuant to this, all CDC and VSD site project personnel have signed a nondisclosure statement. There will be minimal risks to patient privacy and confidentiality. Only VSD Study IDs will be used as identification (linkage to personal information is stored at VSD sites and not at CDC), and all coded information will be stored on secure CDC computers. The research described will be beneficial as new knowledge regarding the safety of maternal COVID -19 vaccines is a priority area for the Immunization Safety Office and for vaccine policy. There are minimal risks to privacy based on the lack of identifiable inf ormation that will be available to CDC investigators, which are reasonable in relation to the importance of the knowledge to be gained. Version: 1. 2 VSD Study Protocol 14 December 2021 Infant Infections and Maternal COVID -19 Vaccination 14 Equitable selection of subjects: Subject selection is based on clinical parameters and the availability of data to asse ss the research objectives. No segment of the population is unfairly excluded from the benefits of this research, and no segment of the population bears an undue burden of research risks. Informed consent: The surveillance project does not involve intervention or interaction with human subjects. A waiver of consent is being requested under 45 CFR 46.116(d) as the research is no more than a minimal risk as described above , the waiver will not adversely affect subjects' rights of welfare, and the research could not be practicably be conducted without the waiver. Impact and future direction: This preliminary data will help fill gaps in safety data on infectious outcomes in infants of pregnant and breastfeeding women who receive COVID -19 vaccination and may help inform policy and regulatory decisions surrounding COVID -19 vaccination in pregnanc y and the postpartum period . The proposed infant safety d ata is paramount, given the historic speed, rollout, and uptake of COVID -19 vaccination in pregnant and lactating women. Further, this example may set the stage in allowing for earlier inclusion of pregnant and breastfeeding women in vaccine trials to evaluate efficacy and safety of maternal immunizations . Improving outcomes for pregnant women and their infants from COVID -19 is a priority with global reach , which can hopefully be done safely though maternal immunization . The impact of the proposed resea rch goes even further in informing future research on the safety of forthcoming maternal immunizations.
