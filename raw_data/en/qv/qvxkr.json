[Jo-Anna Rorie, CNM, MSN, MPH, PhD, FACNM](https://www.bmc.org/about-us/directory/doctor/jo-anna-l-rorie-cnm) The core of my work began in early 1990's when Massachusetts was faced with an infant mortality crisis, especially in the Boston neighborhoods of North Dorchester, Mattapan and Roxbury. An extensive needs assessment led to a city-wide maternal and child health (MCH) agenda. My fingerprints were all over that agenda; and the subsequent recommendations calling for community-based perinatal initiatives that would utilize nurse-midwifery services as a critical element of care for underserved communities. I was the featured midwife in a provocative and pivotal Boston Globe series that highlighted the \"Death Zones of Boston\" - bringing the devastating statistics about racial and ethnic disparities within Boston's infant mortality crisis into the light of day.
