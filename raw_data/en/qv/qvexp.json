In one approach, plasmid DNA is introduced into the host cells for translation into the viral protein, designed to elicit a strong immune response mediated by the cellular and humoral arms of the human immune system. The other approach is a live attenuated recombinant measles virus vectored vaccine: The recombinant measles virus (rMV) produced by reverse genetics is expressed codon-optimized proteins of COVID-19 and induces long-term specific neutralizing antibodies, designed to provide protection from the infection. Status: Zydus Cadila said February 15 it launched an accelerated research program. The company's Vaccine Technology Centre in India is working on the plasmid DNA vaccine, while the company's research arm in Europe, Etna Biotech is working on measles reverse genetics technology that had been successfully used in developing a SARS vaccine.[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row] COVID-19: 200 Candidates and Counting To navigate through the >200 potential therapeutic and vaccine options for COVID-19, GEN has grouped the candidates into four broad categories based on their developmental and (where applicable) clinical progress: [FRONT RUNNER](https://genengnews.com/category/covid-19-candidates/covid-19-front-runner) - the most promising therapeutics/vaccines based on clinical progress, favorable data or both. [DEFINITELY MAYBE](https://genengnews.com/category/covid-19-candidates/covid-19-definitely-maybe) - earlier phases with promising partners, or more advanced candidates in development that have generated uneven data [KEEPING AN EYE ON...](https://genengnews.com/category/covid-19-candidates/covid-19-keeping-an-eye-on/) - interesting technology, attracting notable partners, or both, but preliminary data. [TOO SOON TO TELL](https://genengnews.com/category/covid-19-candidates/covid-19-too-soon-to-tell) - longshots pending additional experimental and/or clinical data. GEN has also tagged the most common treatment types: [ ANTIVIRAL](https://genengnews.com/category/covid-19-candidates/covid-19-antiviral/) "}
