CooneyAAEP News April 2018 IIIETHICS Dr. Horne is the owner of Hoof & Paw Veterinary Service in Purcellville, Va., and a member of the AAEP's Professional Conduct and Ethics Committee.Avoiding practice pitfalls on social media By Paula Alves Horne, DVM Social media, it sounds so friendly and innocuous\u2014a place to be ourselves and become one with a community\u2014but the realities of negotiating this new realm as a professional can be difficult and dismaying. Real risks exist that can have a profound effect on you, your employees and your business. Establishing an ethical standard for you and your employees is an important step toward preventing lost resources, breaches of confidentiality and conflicts of interest, as well as protecting the practice's reputation. Protecting your resources Veterinary practice relies on our employees to take initiative and work independently. Situations abound where employees are not under direct supervision. Since most have smartphones within reach, the opportunity for misusing time during working hours is ample. The use of social media during working hours can be beneficial. It allows the employee the chance to mentally recharge, connect with their family and friends, network with other veterinary pro-fessionals and learn new information or techniques. But the chance for wasting time or misusing company resources is ever-present. Additionally, computer hardware and networks are vulnerable to being compromised if misused on the web. Viruses and malware are abundant and can be downloaded inadvertently. The AVMA has a template for social media use that can be adapted to your practice needs. It is available to AVMA members at https://tinyurl.com/avmasmr. Protecting Privacy Protecting confidentiality is important to any medical practice. As veterinarians, we are trusted to maintain the privacy of our clients and patients. Social media has intruded into this relationship in both naive and malicious ways. Something as simple as posting a photo of a client's horse can be considered unethical if permission is not granted by the owner. You may simply be trying to get advice from colleagues for how to treat a wound, but once the photo is posted on the web, it can go anywhere. This can come back to bite you if the owner is not onboard from the start. A disgruntled employee could also post informa-tion about a case where they feel the client, or their animal, was not treated properly. This could leave the veterinarian and practice open to charges of breaching the confidentiali-ty of the client's information. Written policies and communi-cation with your staff are essential when privacy is at stake. Protecting Your Interests Conflicts of interest can arise when either employees or clients are using the social media sites of a practice for their own gain. These sites require monitoring by the practice to maintain the proper content and tone. It is important to have a designated person or team to maintain a consistent message and to deal with any infractions quickly. The practice manual should have a policy on who can post to the social media sites and what kind of posts are not acceptable, i.e., solicitations, sales of non-practice items, harassment of fellow employees or clients, etc. Care needs to be taken when dealing with clients using the practice name as a reference without permission. You do not want to alienate a good client, but they do need to understand that you need to control the voice of your business. Protecting Your Reputation Negative reviews are a guarantee if you are in business in the wired age. Social media works faster then warp speed when someone has a beef. It is therefore incumbent upon a business owner to make sure that a trusted individual is constantly monitoring the web for reviews that are less than glowing. The practice manager should utilize tools at hand to reply to the complaints as quickly and professionally as possible. You want the client to know that their concerns are heard and addressed; then you can urge them to take the discussion to a more private medium. Hopefully, you can then calmly resolve the issue and have them remove the unflattering comments. The AVMA offers its members some valuable guides and strategies for responding to negative media at https://tinyurl.com/avmasmfc.The maze of social media can be navigated successfully by setting a practice policy for content and use, responding to negative reviews quickly and professionally, and monitoring the web frequently to keep the practice's message on point. Communicating with your staff is essential to make sure they are aware of your desires and restrictions. Social media ultimately should be an avenue for marketing your business and communicating with current and potential clients. Younger staff members can be an important resource in learning about the different apps and how they can be best used to further this goal. \"Community Is King,\" and we all need to learn how to ethically use it to our benefit.Dr. Paula Alves Horne ASSOCIATION IV AAEP News April 2018 In the wake of the #MeToo campaign, where thousands of individuals told their stories on social media platforms about their experiences with workplace harassment, employers are wondering how they can prevent harassment in the workplace and what to do if a complaint arises. Veterinary practice is not free from harassment allega-tions. These allegations can have a negative effect, not just on the victim, but on an employer's bottom line through low productivity and high turnover. State laws vary with regard to harassment and retaliation in the workplace. The following are general tips for employers on how to prevent and/or investigate harassment in the workplace. How Can Employers Prevent Harassment in the Workplace? First, employers need to make sure that they have an anti-harassment policy. If they do have a policy, it is likely that the policy needs to be updated. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has recommended the following general guidelines for anti-harassment polices:r\u0001 5IF\u0001QPMJDZ\u0001TIPVME\u0001JODMVEF\u0001B\u0001DMFBS\u0001FYQMBOBUJPO\u0001PG\u0001 what is prohibited. r\u0001 *U\u0001TIPVME\u0001QSPIJCJU\u0001SFUBMJBUJPO\u0001GPS\u0001UIPTF\u0001XIP\u0001DPNQMBJO\u0001 or assist in the investigation. r\u0001 5IF\u0001QPMJDZ\u0001TIPVME\u0001IBWF\u0001BO\u0001FBTZ\u000eUP\u000eVOEFSTUBOE\u0001 complaint process that has multiple avenues to complain. r\u0001 5IF\u0001QPMJDZ\u0001TIPVME\u0001CF\u0001BWBJMBCMF\u0001JO\u0001BMM\u0001UIF\u0001MBOHVBHFT\u0001 that are used in the workplace. r\u0001 5IF\u0001DPNQMBJOU\u0001QSPDFTT\u0001TIPVME\u0001SFTQFDU\u0001DPOGJEFOUJBMJUZ\u0001 to the extent possible. r\u0001 5IF\u0001DPNQMBJOU\u0001QSPDFTT\u0001TIPVME\u0001QSPWJEF\u0001B\u0001QSPNQU \u0001 thorough investigation. r\u0001 *G\u0001IBSBTTNFOU\u0001JT\u0001GPVOE \u0001UIFSF\u0001TIPVME\u0001CF\u0001QSPNQU\u0001BOE\u0001 proportional corrective action. r\u0001 *U\u0001TIPVME\u0001JODMVEF\u0001B\u0001QSPIJCJUJPO\u0001PG\u0001IBSBTTNFOU\u0001CBTFE\u0001 on any protected characteristic (e.g., race, color, religion, national origin, and sex\u2014including pregnancy, age, disability and in some cities and states, sexual orientation and gender identity). The EEOC Select Task Force on the Study of Harassment in the Workplace Report (June 2016) is available at https://tinyurl.com/stfshwr.In addition to an updated anti-harassment policy, employers need to provide live training on a regular basis to all their employees about preventing harassment. The EEOC recommends that the following be included in the training:r\u0001 5BJMPS\u0001UIF\u0001QSFTFOUBUJPO\u0001UP\u0001UIF\u0001FNQMPZFS\bT\u0001TQFDJGJD\u0001BOUJ\u000e harassment policy. r\u0001 &EVDBUF\u0001FNQMPZFFT\u0001BCPVU\u0001XIBU\u0001DPOTUJUVUFT\u0001 harassment. r\u0001 &EVDBUF\u0001FNQMPZFFT\u0001BCPVU\u0001UIFJS\u0001SJHIUT\u0001BOE\u0001SFTQPOTJCJM - ities should they experience harassment, including specific instructions on the complaint process. r\u0001 5IF\u0001USBJOJOH\u0001TIPVME\u0001CF\u0001TVQQPSUFE\u0001BU\u0001UIF\u0001IJHIFTU\u0001MFWFM\u0001 of the company. r\u0001 5IF\u0001USBJOJOH\u0001TIPVME\u0001CF\u0001JOUFSBDUJWF \u0001JODMVEF\u0001TDFOBSJPT\u0001 and provide opportunities for crowd interaction. r\u0001 5IF\u0001USBJOJOH\u0001TIPVME\u0001JODMVEF\u0001DJWJMJUZ\u0001USBJOJOH\u0001BOE\u0001B\u0001 discussion of bystander intervention. If we have learned anything from the #MeToo campaign, it is that not every victim of harassment reports it for various reasons, such as fear of retribution, embarrassment and self-doubt. Under-reporting is a very real roadblock to prevention. Employers should emphasize (and re-empha-size) to their employees that all employees, especially managers and supervisors, have a duty to report harassment if they see it. How Should Employers Respond to a Complaint of Harassment? If employers receive complaints of harassment in the workplace, how should they respond? First, it is important to note that a complaint does not have to be a written document with the word \"Complaint\" on top of it. It does not matter whether the complaint is oral or informal, or even if it appears to be unfounded\u2014all complaints should be investigated. The EEOC encourages employers to do the following once a complaint has been made: r\u0001 \"DU\u0001QSPNQUMZ\u0001UP\u0001JOWFTUJHBUF\u0001UIF\u0001DMBJNT\u000f#MeToo and veterinary practice: How employers can prevent harassment in the workplace By Sharon Gold Employers should emphasize (and re-emphasize) to their employees that all employees, especially managers and supervisors, have a duty to report harassment if they see it. continued on next pageAAEP News April 2018 V ASSOCIATION During his keynote speech at the AAEP's 2017 Annual Convention, Nigel Marsh challenged audience members to come up with and implement one small change to help bring greater balance into their lives. He requested those commitments be sent to the AAEP for compilation and publication (anony-mously) in the hopes of inspiring other practitioners.

ASSOCIATION VI AAEP News April 2018 Endeavoring to safeguard horse health and minimize risk of disease spread when shipping horses, the Equine Disease Communication Center (EDCC) has published on its website Biosecurity for Equine Transporters. The guidelines-style document provides specific recommendations for ensuring the health of trans-ported horses, cleaning and disinfecting transport vehicles, and limiting stress of equine passengers. \"The major horse transportation companies generally do an excellent job with biosecurity, but there are many amateur transporters who aren't necessarily aware of or don't adhere to best biosecurity practices,\" said Bailey McCallum, EDCC communication manager. \"Biosecurity for Equine Transporters combines current knowledge and established practices from trusted sources into a manageable two-page document of recommended protocols. I encourage veteri-narians to alert their clients who transport horses themselves or with amateur shippers of its availability.\" Visit equinediseasecc.org/biosecurity/travel to access Biosecurity for Equine Transporters.Biosecurity guidance for equine transporters published Protocols accessible through Equine Disease Communication Center website Anne M. Eberhardt 3,500 horses in need vaccinated during UHVRC's 2018 campaign Day's End Farm Horse Rescue, which rehabilitates and rehomes horses seized from animal protection authorities in Maryland and sur-rounding states, is among 226 nonprofit equine rescue and retirement facilities to receive free vaccines in 2018 through the Unwanted Horse Veterinary Relief Campaign (UHVRC). In the 11th year of partnership between the AAEP and Merck Animal Health, the UHVRC provided 3,500 doses of vaccines to protect horses from eastern equine encephali-tis (EEE), western equine encephalitis (WEE), equine rhinopneumonitis (EHV-1 and EHV-4), tetanus, West Nile Virus and rabies. Since its inception, the UHVRC has delivered more than 28,000 doses of core vaccines to protect horses in need. \"Veterinary expenses as well as medi- cations, de-worming and vaccinations are our largest annual expenses in our equine programs,\" said DeEtte Hillman, equine programs director for Day's Farm Horse Rescue in Woodbine, Md. \"Receiving UHVRC vaccinations is a huge help to our horses and helps relieve the financial burden that comes with maintaining a healthy equine program.\" Dr. Richard Forfa, founder of Monocacy in Dickerson, Md., facili- tated the farm's application for free vaccines. The annual application deadline is Jan. 31.

While the majority of horse owners and trainers in our 2012 survey said their usage of their primary veterinarian will likely stay the same over the next few years, 5% of respondents said they anticipate using their veterinarian more often. The reason for increased veterinary needs? Aging horses will require more medical attention. With horses often living well into their 20s and beyond, equine practitioners who are attentive to the unique needs of their older patients often build a successful\u2014and appre-ciative\u2014client niche within their practice. As clients learn about the special medical requirements of their older animals, the veterinarian as care provider and advisor becomes an even more valuable partner. Visit the Touch website at touch.aaep.org for client education materials about the care of aging horses for use in your practice newsletter or website as well as case models about building a geriatric wellness program.

The rate of fatal injury for Thoroughbreds competing in flat races at North American racetracks increased modestly in 2017, according to statistics compiled in the Equine Injury Database (EID) and released March 19 by The Jockey Club.Across all racing surfaces, the incidence of fatality in 2017 was 1.61 per 1,000 starts compared to 1.54 in 2016. Since the EID began collecting data in 2009, the rate of fatal injury has declined 19.5%.\"Although fatality rates increased this year from last year, the increase in rates is not statistically significant,\" said Dr. Tim Parkin, veterinarian, epidemiologist from the University of Glasgow and consultant to the EID. \"However, the overall decline in fatalities since the creation of the EID is statistically significant and reflects a continuously improving safety record for North American racing.\"The 2017 fatality rate for each racing surface (with comparable a lower rate of catastrophic injuries compared to 3-year-olds and older horses; and races less than 6 furlongs had higher injury rates versus middle distance and long races. These trends have been consistent since 2009.

During the Integrative Imaging for Lameness Diagnosis & Treatment track, you'll expand your knowledge and ability to image core regions of the horse to identify lesion locations and normal anatomy as well as performance issues that may not have discreet lameness. Practical takeaways and/or new information The meeting will conclude with an optional half-day of wet labs that will reinforce your ability to implement many of the concepts and procedures presented during the lecture portion of the meeting.

In the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey in late August and enabled by the generosity of donors as well as the equestrian and veterinary communities, the Foundation's Disaster Relief Fund raised nearly $235,000 in cash donations and approximately $60,000 worth of in-kind donations of supplies for equine relief efforts. Additionally, a Foundation-created web page offered direction for individuals wanting to support breed, industry and other reputable organizations assisting with hurricane relief. Working directly with AAEP-member veterinarians and with the support of other industry groups, supplies were deployed quickly to shelter and distribution hubs in Texas and Louisiana following Hurricane Harvey and in Florida following Hurricane Irma. In the lead-up to Irma, the Foundation coordinated efforts to alert those needing to evacuate their horses of shelter locations from Georgia to Kentucky. After Hurricane Maria ravaged Puerto Rico and other Caribbean islands, the Foundation again worked with AAEP members on the ground to assist, including support of cargo shipments of veterinary medical supplies, hay, feed and more. With the storm having knocked out most communications in Puerto Rico, the Foundation was first to send satellite phones to improve communications among equine relief workers on the ground. When late-year wildfires scorched over 500,000 acres in California, including stables and training centers, the Foundation again worked to assist leaders in affected areas. For example, after the Lilac fire in Southern California, the Foundation covered expenses for veterinary medical supplies used by veterinarians to treat burn victims and displaced horses. Although all supplies and much of the donated cash have been distributed, the Foundation continues to provide aid relief for affected horses by working directly with stakeholders on the ground. It also recently approved a grant to support rebuilding of pastures and horse facilities for the St. Croix U.S. Pony Club; and is reviewing other support applications, including for preparedness training programs in multiple states that will aid readiness the next time Mother Nature gets angry and horses suffer. The AAEP Foundation's Disaster Relief Fund accepts gifts and applications for support year-round.

AAEP Educational Partner Profile: Luitpold Pharmaceuticals The United States equine industry generates approximately $122 billion in total economic impact, according to results of the 2017 Economic Impact Study of the U.S. Horse Industry released in early March by the American Horse Council Foundation. The total is an increase of nearly 20% on the approximately $102 billion impact identified when the study was last conducted in 2005. During the same time, the number of horses dropped from 9.2 million to 7.2 million, a not-unexpected decrease due to recent declines in breed registration trends. Texas, California and Florida continue to have the highest population of horses. The study also determined the industry provides a total employment impact of 1.74 million and generates $79 billion in total salaries, wages and benefits. In addition, 38 million, or 30.5%, of U.S. households contain a horse enthusiast, and 38% of participants are under the age of 18. \"Having these updated numbers is critical not only to the AHC's efforts up on Capitol Hill, but also for the industry to demonstrate to the general public how much of a role the equine has in American households,\" said AHC President Julie Broadway. The full national study, along with breakout studies for 15 states, is available for purchase through the AHC website at horsecouncil.org/horsecouncil-publications. The AAEP was among the many equine industry organizations to provide funding support for the survey.

That future is here. Highlights of recent clinically relevant papers Cranial nuchal bursitis In this retrospective case series Amanda Bergren andcolleagues in the USA and the Netherlands analysed horses diagnosed with cranial nuchal bursitis tofurther characterise associated diagnostic, management andprognostic factors. Thirty horses met the inclusion criteria, 21 of which were geldings and nine mares. The most common presentingclinical signs were swelling over the cranial nuchal bursa,pain upon poll palpation, reduced flexion of the neck and abnormal head carriage. Radiographs were obtained in 27/30 cases; 22 of which had radiographic abnormalities. Allhorses underwent ultrasonography, which showed synovialeffusion in most cases. Ten horses were treated with medication only (box rest and nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs or intrabursal injection of corticosteroids), 16 underwent surgery (bursoscopic debridement and lavage) and four underwent surgical treatment following failed medical management. Of the 24 horses that had follow-up information available, 10 had recurrence of clinical signs; the most common of which was residual swelling of the poll region. Horses that underwent surgery after a failed response to medical treatment were more likely to have recurrence of clinical signs, while horses that underwent surgical treatment only were less likely to have recurrence. There was no signi cant difference between the different treatment groups and the likelihood of return to their previous level of work. These results indicate that horses with cranial nuchal bursitis have a fair prognosis for return to their previous level of work, but recurrence of clinical signs is common. Diagnosis of neurological abnormalities In this study William Saville and colleagues in the USA andAustralia investigated interobserver variation when performingneurological examinations in horses. The diagnosis of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) relies heavily on the clinical examination. Accurateidenti cation of neurological signs during a clinical examination is critical to the interpretation of laboratoryresults. This study investigated the level of agreementbetween board-certi ed veterinary internists when performing neurological examinations in 97 horses admitted to aveterinary teaching hospital. A prospective epidemiological research design was used. Horses enrolled in the study were examined by the internistresponsible for care of the horse, and later by an internistwho was not aware of the presenting complaint or othercase history. Data were analysed by descriptive statistics, andkappa statistics were calculated to assess interobserveragreement. Overall, examiners agreed that 60/97 (61.9%) were clinically abnormal, 21/97 (21.6%) were clinically normal, andthe status of 16/97 (16.5%) of horses was contested. Therewas complete agreement among the examiners with regardto cranial nerve signs and involuntary movements.Disagreement involving severity of clinical signs occurred in31 horses, with 25 of those horses (80.6%) considered eithernormal or mildly affected by the primary observer. When examining the results of all paired clinical examinations for 11 different categories, there was wide variability in the results. When examiners rated the presence or absence of any neurological abnormalities, lameness, or ataxia, the agreement among observers was either good or excellent for 80% of horses. When assessing truncal sway, the agreement among observers was good or excellent for 60% of the horses. When examining the horses for asymmetry of de cits, agreement was either good or excellent for 40% of the horses. Agreement among observers was excellent or good for only 20% of the horses when assessing muscle atrophy, spasticity (hypermetria), and overall assessment of the severity of neurological abnormalities. This study underscores the subjectivity of the neurological examination and demonstrates a reasonable level of agreement that may be achieved when different clinicians examine the same horse. Levetiracetam pharmacokinetics in foals In this randomised crossover study Katherine MacDonaldand colleagues in the USA aimed to describe thepharmacokinetics of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam inneonatal foals. Six healthy Quarter Horse foals aged <1-3 days were recruited into the study and administered a single 32 mg/kg bwt dose of levetiracetam either intravenously (IV) orintragastrically (IG); the dose of which was extrapolated from pharmacokinetic data reported for adult horses. In order to determine plasma levetiracetam concentrations all foals were blood sampled at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 35, 45, 60 and 90 min and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36 and 48 h after administration. There were no apparent adverse effects associated with administration of the levetiracetam and plasma concentrations remained within the proposed therapeutic range (5 -45 mg/L) and above the proposed target concentration (35 mg/L) for at least 12 h for both IV and IG administration. Bioavailability for IG administration was excellent, and there was no signi cant difference in the pharmacokinetic variables between IV and IG administration. The authors concluded that administering levetiracetam to neonatal foals at a dose of 32 mg/kg bwt IV or orally twicedaily is likely to maintain therapeutic plasma concentrations. Insulin dysregulation assessment In this study Tobias Warnken and colleagues in Germanyanalysed insulin responses to standard dosed oral glucosetests (OGTs) via nasogastric tubing with the aim of de ning a clinically useful cut-off value. Insulin dysregulation (ID) with basal or postprandial hyperinsulinaemia is one of the key ndings in horses and ponies suffering from equine metabolic syndrome (EMS).Insulin dysregulation can easily be assessed in clinical settingsby performing oral glucose challenge tests. Oral glucose testperformed with 1 g/kg bwt glucose administered vianasogastric tube allows the exact administration of a de ned glucose dosage in a short time. However, reliable cut-off \u00a92018 EVJ 10.1111/eve.12907values have not been previously available. This study aimedto describe variations in insulin response to OGT vianasogastric tubing and to provide a clinically useful cut-offvalue for ID when using the insulin quanti cation performed with an equine-optimised insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Using a model based clustering method which considered all data-points for the classi cation, taking into account the individual insulin trajectory during the OGT, two clusters were differentiated, one with low and one with high insulin responses during OGT. The cluster of individuals with low insulin response was consistently detected, independently of the initialisation parameters of the algorithm. In this cluster the 97.5% quantile of insulin is 110 pLU/mL at 120 min. The authors concluded that OGT performed with 1 g/kg bwt glucose and administration via nasogastric tubing can easily be performed under clinical settings and suggest using an insulin concentration of 110 pLU/mL as a cut-off value for samples obtained at 120 min in OGT. Corneal sensitivity and tear production In this study Kelly Knickelbein and colleagues in the USAcompared corneal sensitivity and tear production in horseswith keratitis to horses with other ocular disease. Medical records were reviewed to identify horses presented during a 1-year period for an ocular complaint whohad Schirmer tear test (STT) or corneal touch threshold (CTT)measured. The following variables were studied: age and sex;affected eye; of the keratitis group. Horses withuveitis, as well as lid, lens, or retinal disease, were categorisedin the group having other ocular disease. For horses presentingmore than once in the study period, only the rst visit at which STT or CTT was measured was included. For horses with bilateral disease, STT and CTT of both eyes were averaged. A total of 108 horses were included, 45 with keratitis and 63 with other ocular disease. Average age was 13.65 years, with 77 males and 31 females. Adjusted for age, STT in affected eyes did not differ signi cantly between the two groups lower in cases with keratitis (33.78 mm) than in cases with other ocular disease (40.10 mm). The authors concluded that corneal sensitivity may be decreased in cases with keratitis. It is not known whether this is a cause or an effect of corneal disease. Antibiotic use in broodmares with endometritis This RCVS Knowledge Summary by Elizabeth Barter andAnnalisa Barrelet looked at the question 'In broodmares with post-service endometritis after natural cover, is antibioticintervention superior to other routine therapies withoutantibiotic intervention in increasing pregnancy rates? 'Literature searches were performed and seven publications were identi ed: two were descriptive studies, one observational study, two randomised nonblinded controlled trials and two nonrandomised nonblinded controlled trials. Included publications were of level 3 (randomised control trials) or level 4 (lower quality controlled trial). The outcomes studied varied between the studies including pregnancy rates at 15 days, 45 days, 60 days, or unknown. There was no standard population treated, antibiotic prescribed or method of administration between the studies. In the three studies with no case selection any treatment was seen to bene t pregnancy rates over no treatment at all. In the two studies with mares with a previous history of endometritis a signi cantly higher pregnancy rate was seen in mares treated with antibiotics and ecbolic agents compared to no treatment at all. In the two studies which compared mares with and without signs of endometritis and treatment with antibiotics, higher pregnancy rates were achieved in mares that were not treated and had no signs of endometritis. The ndings support the need for case selection in treating mares with post-service induced endometritis. There is currently a lack of evidence to suggest that antibiotics delivered into the uterus post-service improves pregnancy rates. The evidence does support that post- service treatment with or without antibiotics improves pregnancy rates in mares with endometritis compared to no treatment (pregnancy rates between 40 -90% compared to 0-56% respectively). The studies further identify the need to recognise mares at risk of post-service endometritis to target appropriate therapy. S. WRIGHT EVE Editorial Of ce References Barter, E. and Barrelet, A.

McGuirk\u00a7, G. Madigan\u00a7, R. Skuce#and U. Fogarty\u00b6 Veterinary Pathobiology, UCD School of Veterinary Medicine, University College Dublin;The Donkey Sanctuary, Co. Cork;\u00a7Central Veterinary Research Laboratory, Backweston, Co. Kildare, Ireland;#Agrifood and Biosciences Institute, Queens University Belfast, (M. bovis ) is an important zoonotic bacterial pathogen causing disease in a wide range of animal species and sporadically causes severe disseminated disease in horses. Thisreport describes the clinical, gross post-mortem examination and histopathological ndings in a case of disseminated M. bovis infection in a donkey which to the authors 'knowledge has not been previously documented in the scienti c literature. Introduction Naturally occurring mycobacterial infections are rare in horses,donkeys and mules; however, sporadic bovis ) 2010) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (O'Reilly and Daborn 1995; Pavlik et al. 2004) have been reported in horses. As well as these obligate pathogens, infection with environmental mycobacteria including smegmatis (Pavlik et al. 2004) and Mycobacterium holsaticum (Oaks 2007) have also been reported in horses, while suspectedcases of Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis infection and an uncharacterised mycobacterial infection have been reported in a donkey and mule, respectively (Kesten 1949; Dierckins et al. 1990). Mycobacterium bovis , the cause of bovine tuberculosis, is an important zoonotic bacterial pathogen also responsible for disease in a wide range of other domestic and wild animal species (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995). In the past, disease caused by M. bovis was the most commonly reported mycobacterial infection of horses (Luke 1958; O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995); however, in conjunction with the introduction of control programmes for M. bovis in other species, the incidence of infections in horses decreased in the second half of the last century (Pavlik et al. 2004) with only occasional cases being reported in the recent literature (Monreal et al. 2001; Keck et al. 2010). Although rare, M. bovis infection in horses has severe consequences as it is usually associated with disseminated disease resulting in death or euthanasia of the animal due to severe clinical disease, poor prognosis, or public health concerns. Case details History A 29-year-old donkey ( Equus africanus asinus ) gelding had been present on the current premises for the previous 4 yearsand was housed with approximately 40 other donkeys in a straw bedded barn with access to pasture during the spring and summer months. During this 4 year period the donkey did not have any direct contact with cattle. Four months previously the donkey had presented with acute onset softtissue swelling of left and right carpal regions. General clinical examination at that time had revealed pain in both carpal regions and decreased range of motion of both carpal joints; however, there was no clinical evidence of respiratory disease. Radiographs of both carpi showed bilateral periarticular soft tissue swelling, while results of haematological and biochemical analysis were unremarkable. Based on the results of these diagnostic investigations the cause of the bilateral carpal swelling was thought to be due to localised cellulitis and responded well to empirical treatment with oxytetracycline (6.6 mg/kg bwt i.v. once and (3 mg/kg bwt per os twice a day [Equipalizone]2). Subsequent to the episode of carpal swelling the donkey showed signs of progressive weight loss which began 4 weeks prior to being examined for acute onset tachypnoea. The donkey had no previous history of respiratory disease. Clinical ndings Four months after presentation for bilateral carpal swelling thedonkey was examined by the same veterinarian for acuteonset tachypnoea. Upon examination, the donkey was inmoderate body condition (body condition score 2.5/5 [Smithand Wood 2008]) but appeared lethargic. Rectaltemperature was elevated (38.6 \u00b0C), heart rate was increased with a rate of 60 beats/min, respiratory rate was increasedwith a rate of 40 breaths/min and there was increasedrespiratory effort. Mucous membranes appeared pale pinkand moist with a capillary re ll time of <2 Thoracic auscultation revealed range 2.2 - 13.39109/L) and monocytosis 9109/L; reference range 0-0.89109/L), while results of serum biochemistry analysis were unremarkable. Based on the history, physical examination and laboratory ndings, in particular the acute onset of disease, tachypnoea, increased respiratory effort, abnormal sounds onthoracic auscultation and the presence of a leucocytosis withneutrophilia, an infectious bronchopneumonia was consideredto be the most likely differential diagnosis. Concurrentidiopathic pulmonary brosis was also considered to be a \u00a92016 as this was a relatively common post-mortem nding in other donkeys from this premises. Further diagnosticinvestigations including thoracic ultrasonography, thoracicradiography and a transtracheal wash were considered to tryto establish a more de nitive diagnosis; however, given the degree of tachypnoea and potential stress to a donkey withrespiratory compromise, it was decided to initiate treatmentrst and reconsider additional diagnostics at a later stage. Treatment and outcome Empirical treatment based on the presumptive diagnosis ofinfectious bronchopneumonia was bwt twice a day [Ventipulmin injection solution]4); however, response to initial treatment was poor andrepeated physical examinations carried out every 2 hshowed that the donkey remained lethargic, tachypnoeic,tachycardic and pyrexic with a severely increased respiratoryeffort and progressively worsening lung sounds. Based on thispoor response to initial treatment, poor prognosis, continuedrapid clinical deterioration and also considering theadvanced age of the animal it was decided that the donkeyshould be subjected to euthanasia 24 h after the start oftreatment. Gross post-mortem ndings On gross post-mortem examination the donkey was inmoderate body condition. Examination of the lungs indicateddiffuse consolidation with an irregular nodular appearance ofthe surface in many areas and multiple coalescing, rm, pale masses diffusely distributed throughout the parenchyma(Fig 1 ). The cranioventral region of the right caudal lung lobe contained multifocal areas of necrosis and the bronchial andmediastinal lymph nodes appeared enlarged. Multiple,variably sized, rm, pale nodular masses were identi ed within the mediastinal space associated with the aorta and ventral aspect of thoracic vertebrae ( Fig 2 ) and a similar focal mass, 5 mm in diameter, was present on the epicardial surface. Within the abdomen, multifocal, rm, pale, smooth surfaced nodules ranging from 1 to 10 mm in diameter were identi ed on the surface of the liver, spleen and diaphragm and withinthe omentum and cortices of both kidneys. On cross section these nodules appeared uniformly pale and rm. The mesenteric and colonic lymph nodes were enlarged. Histopathological ndings Histopathological examination of lung tissue showedeffacement of normal lung architecture with prominentinterstitial and subpleural brosis and a diffuse, severe mixed inflammatory cell in ltration composed predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes with occasionalmultinucleated giant cells, consistent with granulomatousinflammation ( Fig 3 ). In multiple sections of lung the inflammatory in ltrate was organised to form variably sized discrete granulomas characterised by brous tissue surrounding aggregates of macrophages, varying numbers oflymphocytes and occasional multinucleated giant cells(Fig 4 ). A small number of granulomas had central areas of necrosis and acid fast bacilli were identi ed within these areas ( Fig 4 inset). Histopathologically, the masses from the mediastinal space, epicardium, kidney, liver, spleen,diaphragm and omentum were composed of brous tissue surrounding aggregates of macrophages and lymphocytes with some multinucleated giant cells, consistent with chronic granulomatous in flammation. However, no acid fast bacilli were identi ed within these lesions. Microbiological ndings Routine bacterial culture of lung tissue under aerobic andanaerobic conditions isolated a moderate growth of b- haemolytic streptococci as well as light growths of a- haemolytic streptococci and Escherichia coli . Based on the gross post-mortem ndings, mycobacterial infection was considered a possibility and lung tissue was also submitted for mycobacterial culture. After processing by standard methods, extracts from lung tissue were inoculated onto Lowenstein-Jensen medium with pyruvate, Stonebrink 's medium and into a Bactec MGIT 960 tube. Cultures were incubated at 37 \u00b0C. The Bactec MGIT signalled positive after 5 days indicating the presence of mycobacteria and a Ziehl- Neelsen stain carried out showed corded acid fast bacilli.

To obtain more information about the molecular type of the isolated M. bovis , spoligotyping was carried out by standard methods (Kamerbeek et al. 1997). Results characterised the isolate as SB0140. Spoligotypes were named according to an agreed international convention (www.mbovis.org). Discussion Infections caused by M. bovis are rare in equines and it has been suggested that an inherent resistance to infection mayexist based on the observation that equine disease hasremained uncommon in areas where the disease is prevalentin other species (Luke 1958). Historically, M. bovis was the most frequent cause of mycobacterial disease in horses(Innes 1949; O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995) but the incidence has signi cantly decreased with the introduction of eradication programmes in other species and the most common mycobacterial disease currently seen in horses is due to M. avium subsp. avium (Baker 1973; Mair 1995; Pavlik et al. 2004). Mycobacterial infections are less frequently reported in donkeys and mules than in horses. Francis (1958) refers to Galtier (1900) who stated that cases of spontaneous tuberculosis have been observed in donkeys, but these cases were not characterised. Tuberculosis was suspected in a mule imported into Ireland in 1917 based on the gross post-mortem ndings of miliary pulmonary lesions and caseous lesions in the bronchial and mediastinal lymph nodes (Kesten 1949). A case of granulomatous enteritis and lymphadenitis in acid-fast M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis were identi ed has been reported in a donkey, although the diagnosis was not con rmed by culture (Dierckins et al. 1990). To the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst con rmed case of M. bovis causing disseminated tuberculosis in a donkey. Clinical signs of M. bovis infection in horses are varied, depending on the distribution and severity of lesions (Pavlik et al. 2004), and nonspeci c signs are often seen including chronic weight loss, lethargy, weakness, anorexia and pyrexia (Innes 1949; Luke 1958; Cousins 2001; Monreal et al. 2001). Other reported clinical signs include neck stiffness, lameness, nasal discharge, dyspnoea and coughing (Luke 1958;Monreal et al. 2001; Keck et al. 2010). In the current case, chronic disease may have been indicated by the history of recent weight loss; however, clinical signs of respiratory disease were acute in onset despite the presence of extensive chronic lung pathology. Compared with horses, donkeys are reported to have a reduced tendency to cough and this, in conjunction with their sedentary nature, means that lower respiratory tract infections of various aetiologies are often advanced by the time they present clinically (Thiemann 2012). This may account for the acute onset of respiratory signs and rapid deterioration in the current case. The post-mortem ndings in the current case show many similarities to the disease in horses. Mycobacterium bovis causes chronic disease in horses and lesions are often disseminated involving multiple organs including the lungs, spleen, liver, kidneys, intestine and lymph nodes (Innes 1949; Luke 1958; Cousins 2001; Monreal et al. 2001). Compared with lesions of M. bovis in other animals, chronic lesions of tuberculosis in the horse are frequently described as having a neoplastic appearance with little caseation or mineralisation and abundant brosis (Luke 1958; Caswell and Williams 2007) and this appears to be similar in the donkey. Extensive pulmonary brosis was a prominent histopathological feature in the current case and may be similar to the marked brotic reaction seen in other animals with increased resistance to M. bovis infection, such as horses (Caswell and Williams 2007). However, chronic brosis of the subpleural and interstital lung tissues is a common nding in donkeys at post-mortem examination (Thiemann 2012) and it must be considered that the pulmonary ndings in the current case could be caused by concurrent idiopathic pulmonary brosis and M. bovis infection. Identi cation of the aetiological agent in the current case was based on the presence of acid-fast bacilli within pulmonary lesions and culture of M. bovis from lung tissue Fig 3: Prominent interstitial brosis and granulomatous inflammation within the lung. H&E 340, scale bar 250 lm. Fig 4: Pulmonary granuloma characterised by brous tissue surrounding aggregates of 100 lm. EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8 174with con rmation by PCR and reverse hybridisation. The extrapulmonary lesions were assumed to be caused by thesame aetiological agent based on the histopathologicalappearance; however, acid-fast bacilli were not identi ed in these lesions. It is recognised that the numbers of acid-fastbacteria visualised microscopically within lesions caused byM. bovis frequently do not re flect the mycobacterial load as determined by culture (Cassidy 2006). McCune and Tompsett(1956) found that acid-fast bacteria could not be detectedwith certainty microscopically when mycobacterial numberswere less than 10 5colony forming units per ml of tissue and this highlights the importance of culture in identifying mycobacterial infections in horses and donkeys. The route of infection for M. bovis in horses is often assumed to be ingestion (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995; Pavlik et al. 2004; Keck et al. 2010). In the current case intestinal lesions were not identi ed; however, mesenteric and colonic lymph nodes were enlarged and it is possible that infection occurred via ingestion without evidence of intestinal lesions. Inhalation is an important route of infection in cattle and man (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995; de la Rua-Domenech 2006) and infection via this route could also be possible in equines (Keck et al. 2010). Since 1954, Ireland has had a national programme for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis; however, in some regions, M. bovis infection still causes disease in cows, and badgers are considered to be an important wildlife reservoir (Sheridan 2011). Contact with infected cattle has previously been identi ed as a source of infection for a horse with M. bovis tuberculosis (Keck et al. 2010). Possible sources of infection in the current case remain speculative. The donkey did not have contact with cattle during the previous 4 years and during this time it was kept in an area of the country which is considered to be low risk for M. bovis infection in cattle. Also, there has been no evidence to support a diagnosis of M. bovis infection in any other donkey housed on the same premises either previous or subsequent to the current case. However, the donkey 's history prior to this period included a number of years in an area of the country considered high risk for tuberculosis. In human medicine, recrudescence of long-standing latent infections are considered an important cause of clinical cases of M. bovis tuberculosis in people in developed countries (de la Rua-Domenech 2006) and a similar pathogenesis could occur in equines. In this case spoligotyping was carried out to determine the molecular type of the isolated M. bovis . Molecular types of M. bovis tend to be highly geographically localised and can therefore give an indication of likely geographical location at the time of infection. The spoligotype SB0140 identi ed in this case is the spoligotype most frequently identi ed in M. bovis isolates in Ireland (McLernon et al. 2010) and does not give any indication of probable geographic location of the donkey at the time of infection. M. bovis is a zoonotic organism that can cause infection in people through ingestion, inhalation or, less frequently, by contact with mucous membranes or broken skin (de la Rua- Domenech 2006). There appear to be no published reports of M. bovis infection in man attributable to infection acquired from equines; however, horses and donkeys are companion animals and remain a possible source of infection for people. In the current case, veterinary and farm staff that had been in close contact with the infected donkey were screened forexposure to M. bovis with all results negative for M. bovis infection.In conclusion, although infection is rare in equines, mycobacterial disease caused by M. bovis should be considered as a possible differential diagnosis in donkeys presenting with signs of lower respiratory disease. Although clinical signs are generally nonspeci c, submission of samples for mycobacterial culture may be warranted as part of thediagnostic evaluation, particularly in cases where there isevidence of respiratory or generalised granulomatousinflammation or in geographical areas where the disease is prevalent in other domestic species or the wildlife population.

Herbert Adelaide Plains Equine Clinic, Gawler, South Australia. Corresponding author email: ewhdvm@internode.on.net Keywords: horse; burns; re; injury Summary Eight horses with varying degrees of burns sustained in anAustralian bush re were treated over several months. The horses were attended at the scene of the re and then hospitalised from 4 days to 4 months for burns sustained to the head, ventral body and legs. The clinical ndings and treatment of two of the horses are described. Variations with barn re injuries and treatment are noted. While some horses were subject to euthanasia, or died at the scene of the re, all hospitalised horses recovered. Introduction Scienti c literature describing equine thermal injuries is helpful when managing horses that have been burned in barn res, but the literature regarding large numbers of horses in ruralgrass res is scant (Geiser and Walker 1984; Hanson 2005, 2008; Adam 2012). In grass res, the burns are often on the extremities and ventral abdomen, and the treatment of burnsin these areas varies from the dorsal thermal injuries experienced in barn res. While some online descriptions of injuries to the extremities exist, very little is available about the treatment of large numbers of horses that have sustained primarily ventral body burns (Heislers 2009). Emergency treatment literature primarily comes from human-burn experience and even initial triage immediately following the re is controversial. For example, recent literature suggests that icing may be deleterious; however, cooling with tap water may be bene cial (Raine et al. 1981; Marsh 2007; Yuan et al. 2007; Cuttle et al. 2009). Unfortunately, immediate triage and treatment at the scene of a grass re may be limited when there are no standing facilities or running water. Several options for analgesia areavailable (Mathews and Carroll 2007), yet topical dressingsand bandaging can be time-consuming to apply daily(Bischofberger et al. 2013). The economic burden for the owners, and often the veterinarians, of long-term treatmentof burned horses can be prohibitive (Moyer et al. 2013; Herbert and Meyer 2016). In November 2015, a grass re burned over 200,000 acres in 5 h in South Australia. Many horses and thousands oflivestock were killed or severely burned in this re. In the rst few hours after the re, several horses were examined in the eld and then brought to Adelaide Plains Equine Clinic for further treatment. Fourteen horses were hospitalised the rst night; eight were severely burned and six required long-term hospitalisation of up to 4 months. Two horses treated at the scene were subjected to euthanasia on the night of, or in the days immediately following the re. All horses brought tothe clinic had corneal ulcers and burns on their muzzles, andmost of the horses in this incident had extensive burns to thelegs and ventral body; additionally, many had signi cant coronary band separation in the ensuing weeks. There are few reports of how to address the coronary band separation and predict outcomes, so phone conversations from anecdotal previous experience guided decisions on how to treat these horses. This case report describes the treatment for two of the eight severely burned horses from this fast- moving grass re. Case 1 A grey, 9-year-old Quarter Horse mare was examined andtreated within an hour after being trapped in a stubble eld with three other horses. She appeared to be in shock andobvious pain. Her skin was intact, but her mane and tail weresinged with signi cant hair loss. Her coronary bands were leaking serum, her lips and face were burned, and she hadbilateral corneal ulcers ( Fig 1 ). She was treated at the scene with flunixin meglumine (Flunixon Injection) 11.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. and was started on a triple antibiotic eye ointment containing zinc bacitracin 500 iu/g, neomycin sulphate 12 and a cloxacillin benzathine eye ointment Ointment)3 q. 24 h. Silver sulfadiazine (SSD) (Flamazine Cream)4was applied to the coronary bands, lips and other burned areas on her head and legs. She was transported to the clinic a few hours later when vehicles were allowed into the re area and a tetanus toxoid vaccine administered upon arrival. In the rst few days, daily icing of tissues was suggested to stop further destruction of laminae, but we chose not to ice based on reports about possible deleterious effects of loss of local circulation. The local human burn specialist suggested that hosing with tap water was preferred to protect the tissue (J.E. Greenwood, personal communication 2015). The next day, 18 h after she was burned, the mare began to show signs of abdominal and limb oedema. She was eating and drinking with dif culty due to her burned muzzle and still showing signs of pain. She had tachycardia (76 beats/min) and a normal temperature (37.4 \u00b0C). Auscultation of the mare 's heart was over the burned skin, so placement of a stethoscope may have increased her resting heart rate. She was observed passing red urine twice; thus, she was placed on i.v. fluids (Hartmann 's Solution)510 mL/kg bwt/h for 3 h until she appeared to stabilise and was observed eating and drinking, after which no more discoloured urine was observed. The following day, 42 h post rescue, in-house blood biochemical analysis6showed increased muscle 175 - 340l/L), albumen 22 g/L (reference range 22 - 37 g/L), decreased total protein 51 g/L (reference range 57-80 g/L), decreased calcium 2.64 mmol/L (reference range 2.88 -3.55 mmol/L) and increased glucose 9.5 mmol/L (reference range 3.6 -6.1 mmol/L). Urea and creatinine, which were monitored for several weeks, were within normal limits. It was considered likely that the red urine discolouration was due to haemolysis associated with the severe heat (Norman et al. 2005). Over the next few days the mare 's skin, appetite and pain levels were monitored. Oedema increased over 3 days (Fig 1 ). The skin became dry and sensitive to touch and she began to show hair loss on her legs, neck, perineum and abdomen. Despite her pain, her appetite was always good and she showed interest in other horses and her environment over the next few days. The corneal ulcer medication was continued and she was given flunixin twice daily for pain. She was placed on omeprazole (Gastrozol Daily)71 mg/kg bwt per os q. 24 h. She was also started on trimethoprim/sulphadimidine (Trimidine) 830 mg/kg per os q. 12 h for 4 days. On Day 6, she had a small abscess from her i.v. catheter which had been removed on Day 4. E. coli and bhaemolytic Streptococcus were cultured. She was given ceftiofur (Norocef)12 mg/kg bwt i.m. q. 24 h for 4 days. Over the next 2 weeks, she lost more hair and pigment. Her neck and thorax became dry, and there was a notedloss of elasticity. Areas that had not been painful to touchwere now very sensitive. At this stage, Aloe vera gel 9was introduced and applied twice daily to exposed areas beforewashing and debridement. The observable burns now covered about 60 -70% of her body surface area ( Fig 1 ). Most of the affected areas would be classi ed as deep second degree burns with some small areas of third degree burns onthe distal limbs and face. The general impression of staff was that the worst of the visual damage was realised on about Day 18. The pinna of both ears began to show signs of erosion; they both eventually contracted, resulting in a permanent contracture ( Fig 2 ). Unlike the other horses burned in the re, this mare was very slow to heal especially in the perineal and mammary regions ( Fig 2 ). Daily abdomen area were washed with a mild soap (L.O.C.).11 Antibacterial soaps such as a chlorhexidine or betadine scrubwere tried, but they were irritating to the skin and inducederythema and exudation. The L.O.C. soap was also found tosoften the eschar and allowed for easier removal. Cottonwool stuck to the eschar and on advice from a burnspecialist nurse, a sterilised woven bre cloth (Chux) 12was used to clean the wounds. Atrst, locally produced raw honey was used on one side of her legs and body and SSD cream on the other. After 1 week, the raw honey appeared to be superior with less exudation and erythema and the SSD cream was discontinued for a few weeks, except on her exposed unbandaged areas where honey dried quickly and attracted insects. We were cautioned that SSD cream was degraded by sunlight to colloidal silver as noted by the darkening of the product, so precautions were taken to prevent exposure to direct sunlight (Kunkely and Vogler 2007; Fuller 2009). Oral ulceration was noted around her gums and tongue. Concern was raised that this could be from licking SSD cream, which can be severely irritating to the mucous membranes and conjunctiva in people. The oral ulcers eventually resolvedwithout con rmation of the source. Initially, the mare was heavily bandaged and slings created using human medical arm slings (Actimove Sling) 13 were used to hold the bandages high on both the front and 1 h 3 days 18 month 1 month Fig 1: Case 1: The visual stages of healing after being caught in an Australian bush re. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd178 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8hind legs ( Fig 3 ). Combinations of honey, SSD and Aloe vera gel were applied to her legs. The honey tended to dryquickly, thus, petroleum-impregnated gauze (Jelonet10 cm 97m ) 4was also used over the wounds to prevent drying. Flexing and lifting the limbs was initially dif cult and made all the burned horses anxious. After a few weeks, the heavy bandages were replaced with thin bandages comprised of the woven cotton bre cloth impregnated with honey and overlayed with 15 cm cast padding (Soffban orthopaedicpadding) 4and tubular crepe socks (Tubifast 10 cm),14still held by the slings ( Fig 3 ). Acticoat dressing4, a silver impregnated dressing, was used at 1 month following the incident which helpeddecrease the frequency of bandaging. The sheets of Acticoat dressings were dif cult to wrap around the contours of the legs, but they remained in place for 48 h. The majority of the mare 's pain was controlled with i.v. flunixin. as needed was also employed At one point, methadone (Methadone Injection)100.05 mg/kg bwt b.i.d. was used for 2 days until the mare showed signs of colic. After 2 weeks, pruritus was also becoming evident, and topicalcorticosteroid creams were ineffective in controlling the itching. Reserpine (Rakelin) 150.0055 mg/kg bwt per os was used daily and then used two or three times weekly for about 5 weeks during a period of very high ambient temperatures. a) c) d)b) Fig 3: Case 1: a) Applying a honey soaked Chux; b) demonstrating comfortable mobility in the Hidez compression suit; c) larger initial bandages demonstrating the support straps.

In the evening, she was given access to pasture andthis seemed to improve her mental attitude. On Day 41, her skin was dry and tight and during the night it split in several places, including the back of her carpi,axillary areas and groin ( Fig 4 ). Since there was nothing she could rub against that would cause the splits, it wasconsidered likely that this condition was due to dryness andlack of skin compliance. Thereafter, she was emollient (Sorbolene) 16and other emollients 2-3 times daily. This created a setback of several months in full epithelisation of the entire body. Skin grafts were contemplated for her legs, but the tissue was so friable and occasionally continued to spontaneously split, precluding the chance of successful grafting. Over the next 2 months, she continued to grow ne, thin skin. Exuberant granulation tissue on the back of her carpi was periodically removed. Over the next year, there were still areas without pigment and signi cant areas without hair, particularly on the legs. The swelling in her lower limbs abated and she moves freely. The perineal, mammary and inner thigh regions, considered to be initially deep grade 2 burns, were very slow to heal. Fortunately, no fungi or yeast were grown on cultures. Several different types of products, including zinc oxide diaper rash creams were tried to no avail. Finally, at 4 months, all washing and treatment of the area was discontinued and, over the next few weeks, the area beganto heal ( Fig 2 ).At this time, the only product used on her legs and body was a combination of sorbolene and SSD cream; the bandage changes were extended to every 2 -3 days. The mare was kept in an air-conditioned environment, which appeared to be useful for comfort and decreasing reactions to the dressings. The mare 's new skin was pink, but over time it regained some of the normal pigment of a grey horse and then hair regrew ( Fig 4 ). At about 4 months, a body compression suit was used (Hydez) 17so she could be outside during the day (Fig 3 ). These suits are made to order and tted to each horse. On Day 134, she was discharged but came back twice weekly for bandage changes. Her coronary bands did not separate as much as in some of the other affected horses, but as they grew out, the line of damage was evident. At 6 months, she became lame, but no rotation was noted on radiographs ( Fig 5 ). She was shod with pads on the front feet, resulting in reduced lameness. During her time at the clinic, it was obvious from the extent of scarring and thickening of the extremities that she would not be ridden again in the immediate future and she was bred through arti cial insemination. In February 2017, she foaled a healthy colt. Because of the severe damage in her perineal and inguinal area, her ability to produce milk was a concern, but she made suf cient milk for the foal 's needs. The legs have completely healed; however, large areas of skin without hair continued and will probably remain. She is sound, but slightly dis gured ( Fig 1 ). Case 2 An 8-year-old chestnut Thoroughbred mare was examined onsite 3 -4 h after the same re as in Case 1. She had run through a fence with other horses during the re to avoid the flames. The mare appeared to be in moderate to severe pain and was stomping, avoiding skin contact, exhibiting muscle tremors and appearing anxious. She had burns to her face, legs and ventral abdomen and coronary band effusion. Her burns were classi ed as grade 2 with some grade 3 on her hock, forearm and fetlock. She had bilateral corneal ulcers, as did the other six horses that were with, or near, her on this property. She was treated with flunixin, SSD cream and eye ointments like the previous horse and at the same dose rates ( Fig 6 ). She was transported to the clinic that evening, where assessment of her condition revealed lacerations on the rightproximal carpus, left dorsal hock and fetlock on her right hind leg. She was administered trimethoprim/sulfadimidine immediately as per Case 1 and maintained on antibiotics because of puncture wounds from attempting to escape the a) b) c) d) Fig 4: Case 1: a) Progression showing the return of pigment and then hair on the thigh at 1 month; b) 18 months following the re with incomplete return of pigment and hair; c) spontaneous spliton the palmar right carpus; d) 18 months later.

She had a good appetite on the rst night and ate hay, despite the pain from her blistered lips. The next morning, she was reassessed with heavy sedation as per Case 1. Her legs were cleaned andbandaged using SSD cream. The primary concerns werecoronary band effusion, possible shock and carpal and hindlimb lacerations, which may have penetrated the carpus andfetlock joints. She was given Hartmann 's solution at the same rate as previously reported, as well as flunixin and omeprazole. While the lacerations and especially thepuncture wound on the carpus were an issue and requiredcontinued antibiotic administration, this report concentrateson the effects of the thermal injuries. She drank and ate welldespite the burns on her muzzle and i.v. fluids were discontinued after the rst day when the laboratory report indicated adequate hydration overnight. The eyes weretreated with the same antibiotic ointments mentioned inCase 1 and her face and chest initially treated with rawhoney. Her coronary bands showed further signs ofinflammation with continued leakage and honey was applied. After the rst day, her legs were bandaged with raw honey on one side and SSD cream on the other to assesswhich treatment was best. This application was continued fora week before the SSD cream was discontinued because ofhyperaemia and effusion; honey was used under thebandages instead. On Day 9, radiographs of her four feet were taken. Both dorsopalmar and lateromedial views were examined ( Fig 7 ). No early sign of distal phalangeal rotation was evident,despite the continued separation of the coronary bands. At one point, maggots invaded the sites of coronary band separation and pronil (Frontline spray) 18was applied to the area with no apparent deleterious effect. Pruritus was evident on Day 10. Different topical dressings, including SSD, Aloe vera gel, sorbolene and honey, were interchanged with no decrease in the pruritus. The mare would also have periods where her appetite appeared to decrease and then resume. The pain control was changed to meloxicam (0.6 mg/kg bwt, per os q. 24 h)19as her pain appeared to be decreasing. Visual deterioration of the burns peaked at about Day 12 ( Fig 8 ). On Day 22, she no longer needed sedation for treatments and bandaging, but on Day 28, the mare was intensely pruritic and appeared agitated; she was toe pointing and the source of the pain was not clear. Venograms were considered, but the process of injecting through already inflamed skin was prohibitive. Radiographs in the affected foot showed no distal phalangeal rotation. It appeared that her bandage was the most likely cause of the irritation. She was given ketamine combined with detomidine, as per Case 1. A new bandage was applied, she was turned out to grass and the pain seemed to subside. The ambient temperatures were very high during this period. Again, water coolers were implemented and the mare was notably more comfortable and showed less evidence of pruritus. She returned to eating and was no longer agitated. The ketamine-detomidine combination wascontinued as needed, no more than three times per day for a few days. Over the next 2 weeks, her wounds continued to improve and the burns re-epithelialised quickly ( Fig 8 ). She became more animated and even cantered around when given access to a yard in the evening or early morning when the outside temperatures were cooler ( Fig 9 ). The mare was discharged after 40 days of hospitalisation. Subsequently, she was examined at 3 and 6 months. The burns on her legs healed with very little residual scarring. Her lacerations also healed, but she was lame from the puncture wound to her carpus. Her coronary band defects were growing out and not causing any lameness. However, at 9 months, she developed lameness when the last of the hoof wall defect was growing out, as in Case 1. Sole pressure was painful, but when her feet were cleaned, the pain subsided. Also at 9 months, she developed bilateral sole abscesses, which were poulticed. At the next hoof trim, the last of the old sole was removed and she was deemed sound except for loss of range of motion in the damaged carpus. In February 2017, she was successfully bred and will foal in January 2018. Of the initial 14 horses brought to the clinic, eight were considered signi cantly burned. The range of hospitalisation for all the horses was 4 -134 days. Six of the horses stayed approximately 1 month. All but two of the horses admitted to the clinic have returned to their designated sport. The days for various treatments and days hospitalised for the worst cases are presented in Table 1 . Discussion Our experience with these severely burned horses from alarge, rapidly moving bush re showed some differences with the predominant equine burn literature, which is more Fig 6: Case 2: The initial presentation before the extent of the damage was obvious. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd181 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8focused on barn res. For example, signi cant issues at the scene of the re, such as lack of water and infrastructure, meant we did not have facilities to cool the limbs. Also, a local human burn specialist we consulted following the re suggested that we apply SSD cream to the burned skin and wrap the legs with cling wrap for the initial immediate treatment to preserve the skin and reduce contamination (J.E. Greenwood, personal communication 2015). Our initial treatment of i.v. fluid therapy could have been started as soon as the horses arrived at the clinic, but this was in the middle of the night and we were limited at that stage with personnel and had to concentrate on getting the horses accommodated. We were surprised to see that even the worst of the horses were eating and drinking. Having had a previous experience from a re where no horses were burned, but many horses got post-stress colic from transportation out of the path of the re, we only offered small amounts of food for the rst 2 days. It was only later that day we realised that many of the horse 's injuries were worse than initially thought. The extent of burns on the horses was far greater than the predicted survival rate in the literature (Hanson et al. 2013). On a visit to see the horses, the human burn specialist suggested that the classi cation of the wounds on these two horses 'extremities would be deep second and third degree burns in many areas. He expected we would be doing skin grafts to achieve nal resolution. This was notthe case which might highlight potential differences in classi cation of burns in man. Our criteria for euthanasia were uncontrollable pain and loss of appetite. Despite the extent and depth of burns and intravascular haemolysis in the peripheral tissue, Case 1 did not stop eating and was very vocal in the morning when food was distributed. Only one horse showed any respiratory signs from smoke inhalation, which resolved in 24 h. While we heard of horses with respiratory compromise from this re, we ourselves did not see any. In comparing cases from another interstate practice with a similar re 1 month following this re, they found it was rare to have respiratory compromise. Perhaps, this is due to a fast-moving re and strong winds that sweep away smoke and ash. Current published literature suggests that infection can be a signi cant problem (Geor and Ames 1991; Kemper et al. 1993; Marsh 2007). We found that infections were only problematic if the horse had signi cant penetrating wounds, such as in Case 2, and that SSD cream and honey were both satisfactory for dressing the legs. However, SSD cream has somewhat fallen out of favour in the human burn literature because SSD has been shown to slow down healing (Al-Waili 2004; Malik et al. 2010; Bischofberger et al. 2011; Heyneman et al. 2016). The use of Acticoat dressing antimicrobial bandages did allow us to increase the interval between dressing changes, but because we did not experience signi cant infections, the Day 8 Day 28 6 months6 months Day 28 Day 10 Fig 7: Case 2: Coronary band/hoof wall separation over time. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd182 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8expense of these dressings may not be warranted in allcases (Heyneman et al. 2016). While some horses seemed to respond better to one or the other topical burn product, they may be successfullyswitched after a few days if supplies are low. Aloe veramixed with other skin emollients proved to be helpful for dryskin that did not actually slough and was bene cial for soothing the burned areas after the initial 10 -14 days (Maenthaisong et al. 2007; Panahi et al. 2012). Reports of decreased healing time have been noted, although some patients experience pruritus and pain with Aloe vera applications and deterioration of the product may occur with storage (Maenthaisong et al. 2007). While manuka honey has been proposed to be a superior product, raw honey seemed to work well when the use of manuka honey was cost prohibitive and not readily available in the large amounts needed (Bischofberger et al. 2011). Mild soap seemed to facilitate softening and removal of dead skin and was well tolerated. Both dilute chlorhexidineand betadine were tried, but they caused signi cant skin irritation in all the horses. While every horse brought to the clinic had corneal ulcers, there were no complications from the ulcers. Simple twice daily treatments with triple antibiotics plus daily cloxacillin resulted in corneal healing with no scarring (Kuckelkorn et al. 2002). It was expected that some of the ulcers might have fungal contamination, or the affected eyes may have developed signi cant uveitis, but this did not eventuate. Long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs did not result in clinical signs that would suggest toxicity. Despite severe stress, bowel motions were normal throughout hospitalisation and appetites were not suppressed. The prophylactic use of omeprazole may have been bene cial in preventing adverse effects. Bandaging was dif cult in the initial stages because of pain. The horses did not want to lift their legs when we applied stocking bandages.

Once the burnsstarted to heal, horses tolerated body compression suits and were observed trotting and cantering with the suits on. They did not sweat under the body suits, despite the high ambient Fig 9: Case 2: 1 month after the re: the mare was now moving freely except for a loss of range of motion from a penetrating carpal wound.

Compression suits are standard of care inhuman patients and the human burn specialist noted theyseemed to be as good as those used in people. The use ofcooling fans and occasional oral reserpine helped with thepruritus, which lasted for a few weeks. Coronary band effusion was noted on the rst day; separation to some degree occurred in most of the horsesover the rst week, but it was quite severe in three horses. The coronary band separation resulted in abnormal hoof growthuntil the hoof grew out at about 6 months. When the oldhoof was nearly replaced, two horses exhibited lameness,which coincided with winter rain and mild abscessation insome feet. We are of the opinion that the thickened hoofwall distal to the coronary band protected the majority of thelaminae from thermal injury. We hope that the information we have shared from our experience will assist other veterinary specialists tocare for horses caught in wild res; many of these methods possibly could be modi ed for similar large animals such as cattle. Some rural res necessitate alternate approaches to immediate triage and the type of re leads to patterns ofre damage and treatments somewhat different from a typical barn re.

Lores*, J. Cantos, M. De Rijck and C. O 'Shea Sharjah Equine Hospital, Sharjah, with diarrhoea anddepression. During hospitalisation, the mare developed septicthrombophlebitis associated with a jugular catheter. Oneweek later, she developed secondary bilateral tarsocruraljoint septic arthritis. Following surgical intervention andintensive medical therapy, the mare recovered successfully.The case highlights an unusual and previously unreportedcomplication of septic thrombophlebitis. Introduction Septic thrombosis may progress to serious complications thatcan be life-threatening and lead to increased mortality ratesor loss of use of the horse for its intended purpose (Dolenteet al. 2005). Previously reported complications of septic thrombophlebitis in mature horses include bacteraemia,endotoxaemia, vegetative endocarditis, pulmonarythromboembolism via 2005; Dias de Lacerda Neto 2013). In the present case, haematogenousspread of septic thrombi from the jugular vein resulted indevelopment of bilateral tarsocrural septic arthritis. The septic thrombosis was addressed successfully by standing jugular phlebotomy and drainage of infectedmaterial within the vein. Additionally, the septic arthritis wastreated successfully by systemic administration ofantimicrobials and anti-in flammatory debridement, i.v. regional limbperfusions with antimicrobials. History A 3-year-old Arabian mare was admitted to Sharjah EquineHospital for evaluation and treatment of diarrhoea and signsof abdominal discomfort of 2 days 'duration. The mare appeared dull and dehydrated and exhibited tachycardia of 80 beats/min. On abdominal auscultation, intestinal borborygmi were absent in all quadrants. A large, rm impaction was identi ed in the large colon on rectal palpation. Transabdominal ultrasonographic examination was unremarkable and complete blood count was within normal limits. Plasma brinogen was elevated (5.05 g/L; reference range [rr] 2.0 -4.5 g/L) and serum a of creatinine (32 mg/L; rr: 8 -22 mg/L), and a aminotransferase (625 U/L; rr: 100 -600 U/L). Treatment of the large colon impaction included feed withholding, the administration of balanced i.v.fluids and enteral rehydration therapy via nasogastric intubation. The impaction resolved in 2 days, so the mare was reintroduced to feed. On Day 3, all the laboratory parameters had normalised and the i.v. catheter was removed. Thrombophlebitis -clinical ndings and diagnosis On Day 4, a swelling was noticed over the left jugular vein.Ultrasonographic examination of the area revealedperivascular oedema, thickening of the vein wall and anocclusive hyperechoic thrombus at the prior insertion site of thecatheter. Treatment including application of warm compresses,hydrotherapy and topical application of dimethyl sulfoxidesolution to the swollen vein was performed three times daily.Systemic antibiotic therapy using oral enro floxacin (Uvetril 1)w a s commenced and aspirin (Jusprin2) was given orally on alternate days (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). However, over the following days the swelling increased markedly, the proximal two-thirds of the jugular vein palpated very rm and a purulent discharge drained out at the catheter 's insertion and chloramphenicol, was isolated on bacterial culture of the discharge. Septic arthritis -clinical ndings and diagnosis One week after the septic thrombophlebitis was observed,the mare developed acute bilateral hindlimb lameness brinogenaemia (10.17 g/L). Synovial fluid from both tarsocrural joints was obtained and fluid analysis concentration revealed increased total protein (40 g/L in both joints, normal <20 g/L) and increased white blood cell (WBC) count (left tarsocrural joint 85 9109cells/L and the right 67 9109cells/L; normal <0.29109cells/L); cytological examination revealed >80% neutrophils in both joints (normal<10%) (Morton 2005). No organisms were isolated from the synovial fluid using routine culture techniques. As the condition had worsened over 7 days of therapy, systemic antibiotic and anti-in flammatory medications were adjusted. The antibiotic was changed to oral chloramphenicol(Viceton 3) based on the sensitivity of bacteriological culture. Nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory therapy using phenylbutazone (Bute4) was started and aspirin administration was discontinued. In an attempt to eliminate the jugular vein infection rapidly and thereby eradicate the presumed source of the \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd187 sedation andlocal anaesthesia (Russell et al. 2010). After removing the septic contents of the jugular vein through four stab incisions,three Penrose drains were placed along the lumen of thevein to prevent premature closure of the surgical sites ( Fig 1 ). Later the same day, bilateral tarsocrural joint arthroscopiclavage was performed under general anaesthesia. On thefollowing day, analysis of synovial fluid from both joints revealed a marked decrease in the WBC count of the righttarsocrural joint (3 910 9cells/L) whereas the fluid from the left joint was still markedly elevated (32 9109cells/L). Therefore, standing through-and-through needle lavage ofthe left tarsocrural joint of signs (lameness, effusion andperiarticular oedema) and until the synovial fluid showed a signi cant reduction of the WBC (WBC 8: 10910 9cells/L). sodium (Excenel5) was administered daily following joint lavage. Additionally, a left tarsus i.v. regional limb perfusion with meropenem (Meronem6) was performed every 48 h via puncture of the vena saphenous for a total of six treatments. The mare then recovered progressively from both septic conditions and haematology and serum biochemistry values also normalised over time. She was administered oral choramphenicol for a total of 4 weeks and oral phenylbutazone for 10 days. The jugular vein surgical site healed completely in 2 weeks ( Fig 2 ) and both tarsocrural joints resumed a normal appearance by 4 weeks. The mare was discharged in the eighth week with instructions for 3 months of stable con nement in combination with controlled exercise and physical therapy. Six months after discharge the mare was reported to be back in training and in full Arabian show condition. Discussion Septic arthritis is a serious clinical problem. This condition isconsidered to be multifactorial since both host and micro-organism contribute to the severity of the clinical signs(Carstanjen et al. 2010). There are important differences between the common sources of infection in mature horsesvs. foals with septic arthritis. In mature horses, the infection is usually secondary to direct synovial contamination through wounds, surgery or intra-articular injection (Carstanjen et al. 2010), whereas in neonates and young foals, the most frequent cause of septic arthritis is haematogenous spread of bacteria into a joint (Schneider et al. 1992a; Meijer et al. 2000; Morton 2005). In contrast to the incidence in foals, haematogenous septic arthritis occurs only rarely in mature horses (Schneider et al. 1992a). Polyarthritis is often present in neonates (50%) whereas septic polyarthritis is much less common in mature horses (1.5%) (Morton 2005). A tentative diagnosis of septic arthritis can be made on the basis of clinical signs. History of a recent wound or traumatic event, arthrocentesis, joint surgery, systemic illness or immunocompromise is often reported and vital parameters are usually within normal limits (Carstanjen et al. 2010). Nevertheless, one study revealed that 54% of the horses referred to a clinic for septic arthritis presented with fever (Carstanjen et al. 2010). Typically, horses with septic arthritis are profoundly lame, to the point of nonweightbearing. Marked joint effusion, periarticular heat and swelling, and increased sensitivity to palpation and manipulation are generally observed. In foals with septic arthritis, remote sites of primary infection should be investigated; diarrhoea, umbilical infection, pneumonia or other systemic illness is frequentlypresent (Morton 2005). The tarsocrural joint is reported to be the joint most commonly affected in all horses with septic arthritis (Schneider et al. 1992b; Meijer et al. 2000). In the present case, both tarsocrural joints were involved. Fig 1: The phlebotomy site at completion of surgery. Fig 2: The phlebotomy site 3 weeks post-surgery. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd188 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8Peripheral blood analysis of mature horses with septic arthritis might show elevated levels of brinogen, total protein and WBC count with neutrophilia. However, horses with acuteseptic arthritis unrelated to systemic disease often havenormal complete blood counts. The peripheral bloodchanges observed in the present case were probably relatedto both septic conditions (arthritis and thrombophlebitis).Serum amyloid A (SAA), the major acute phase protein inhorses, increases in serum and synovial fluid in horses with septic arthritis. Therefore, synovial SAA is a useful adjunct indiagnosis and evaluation of clinical progression of septicarthritis in horses (Ludwig et al. 2016; Sanchez-Teran et al. 2016). Blood culture should be employed when haematogenous spread is suspected and synovial fluid analysis, cytology and culture are paramount in establishing a diagnosis (Carstanjen et al. 2010). Septic synovial fluid is characterised by lowered viscosity (length of strand normal 2.5 7.3) and glucose ( <400 mg/L, or less than half the serum glucose concentration), and elevated level of total protein al. 2010). of total nucleated cells is elevated ( >30910 9cells/L; normal <0.29109cells/L), and can often approach and exceed 100 9109cells/L (Morton 2005; Carstanjen et al. 2010). Signi cant and persistent neutrophilia in synovial fluid is one of the earliest hallmarks of infected equine joints and the neutrophils may have toxicchanges but are often healthy in appearance (Tulamo et al. 1989; Morton 2005). Intracellular bacteria may be identi ed in cytological examinations but are only reported to be observed in 25% of cases (Morton 2005). Culture of synovial fluid should be attempted but bacteria may not always be recovered using conventional culture techniques (Tulamo et al. 1989; Morton 2005; Carstanjen et al. 2010). Aerobic and anaerobic culture using blood culture medium may increase the chance of obtaining a positive result (Morton 2005; Carstanjen et al. 2010). Synovial membrane biopsies can also be used for microbial culture and submitting both synovial fluid and synovial membrane increases the likelihood of identi cation of the causative micro-organism (Morton 2005). Radiographic examination does not contribute to detection of a septic process in a joint directly but could provide additional information such as soft tissue swelling or evidence of bone involvement/osteomyelitis that dramatically reduces the prognosis for future soundness. Ultrasonography can be used to detect distension of the joint as well as echogenic particles floating in the synovial fluid (Carstanjen et al. 2010). The technique is also useful to guide centesis for collection of synovial fluid from complex joints, synovial bursas and tendon sheaths (Morton 2005). Other imaging modalities include magnetic resonance imaging and nuclear scintigraphy when soft tissues are affected, and computed tomography when there is suspicion of bone involvement (Carstanjen et al. 2010). Treatment is aimed at rapid elimination of the infection and removal of debris and in flammatory products from the joint cavity to minimise damage to articular cartilage (Schneider et al. 1992b; Meijer et al. 2000). Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs should be administered to decrease pain thereby preventing serious pain related complications, suchas laminitis and caecal impaction (Morton 2005). Anti-inflammatory drugs reduce synovial in flammation thereby decreasing prostaglandin-E 2production and associated collagen destruction. A combination of systemic broad spectrum antibiotics should be used during the early stages of the disease and if an anaerobic micro-organism is suspected, metronidazole may also be included (Morton 2005; Carstanjen et al. 2010). Direct intra-articular administration of antimicrobials can be performed daily to eliminate the offending organism as quickly as possible. Injection of gentamicin into equine joints has been reported to cause mild, transient in flammation but this is much less detrimental than the septic process itself (Schneider et al. 1992b). In the present case, 1 g of ceftiofur was injected daily into the left joint over 8 days without noticeable side effects. Regional i.v. and intraosseous limb perfusions are also effective methods for delivering higher concentrations of antibiotics to synovial tissues (Morton 2005). In the present case, i.v. regional limb perfusion using 500 mg of meropenem diluted in 50 mL of saline was performed six times on alternative days without any side effects. Many surgical techniques have been described for the physical removal of bacteria, in flammatory products and devitalised tissues from the joints. Arthroscopic debridement and lavage have been shown to improve survival rate and prevent loss of use in horses with infected joints (Carstanjen et al. 2010). Through-and-through lavage can be performed in standing, sedated horses with fair to even good results (Meijer et al. 2000). In horses with chronic or recurring septic arthritis, open drainage by arthrotomy is indicated (Schneider et al. 1992b). In most cases, multiple therapies are used simultaneously until clinical signs and synovial parameters have normalised (Schneider et al. 1992b; Morton 2005). In the present case, arthroscopic exploration and lavage was not enough to control the septic problem in the left joint. Subsequently, we repeated several through-and-through joint lavages until we achieved a signi cant reduction in the WBC count (10.35 9109 cells/L) (Meijer et al. 2000). A possible explanation for the slow normalisation of synovial fluid total protein and nucleated cell count values in this case might have been the direct effects ofthe repeated through-and-through joint lavage in synovial fluid (Sanchez-Teran et al. 2016). Horses with marked pannus, osteochondral pathology or osteomyelitis are less likely to survive. The main causes of failureinclude an inability to eliminate the causative agent anddisruption of the destructive in flammatory cycle (Meijer et al. 2000; Morton 2005). However, with early intervention andimplementation of an aggressive surgical approach, theprognosis for septic arthritis in the mature horse is fair to verygood (Meijer et al. 2000; Morton 2005). Once the infection and synovitis have resolved, the horse should be subjected to 2 - 4 months of stable con nement in combination with controlled exercise and physical therapy (Meijer et al. 2000; Morton 2005). Treatment of septic arthritis that is secondary to haematogenous invasion of bacteria from another focus ofinfection appears to be more complex. In such cases, it is ofparamount importance that remote sites of primary infectionare treated in order to eliminate them as the source ofpathogens in the joint (Meijer et al. 2000). Fortunately, such cases are rare in mature horses (Meijer et al. 2000). In one of those reported cases spread came from a ventral midlineincision infection while in another case spread was from aprevious soft tissue injury (Schneider et al. 1992a). We describe here an atypical case where a mature horse \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd189 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / septic arthritis from a veinseptic thrombophlebitis. Thrombophlebitis de ned as venous thrombosis to in flammation of the vessel wall. Jugular thrombophlebitis is a commonly observed, undesirable,iatrogenic complication seen in equine practice, particularlyduring intensive care (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). Itoccurs almost exclusively at the site of placement of an i.v.catheter and in colic cases it has been estimated to occurin 2 to >50% of catheters left in situ >48 h (Lankveld et al. 2001; Geraghty et al. 2009; Klohnen 2009; Russell et al. 2010). The condition may progress to life-threatening complications and reported complications of septic thrombophlebitis in horses include bacteraemia, endotoxaemia, vegetative endocarditis, pulmonary thromboembolism and pleu- et et al. 2005; Dias aetiological local trauma, venous stasis, andaltered coagulation status, the most important of which islocal, ongoing injury of the jugular vein caused by thecatheter (Lankveld et al. 2001). Horses particularly at risk are critically ill patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, septicfoals and mature horses subjected to severe systemicinflammatory response syndrome, severe intestinal disease, endotoxaemia, salmonellosis disease processes are also known to be associatedwith the development of a general hypercoagulation state,which is believed to be attributable to the loss of speci c anticoagulant proteins such as protein C and antithrombin III(Dolente et al. 2005). The degree of debilitation of the horse is also an important predisposing factor for the occurrenceof thrombophlebitis caused by Schaer and Epstein 2009). Silastic catheters are known to be the least thrombogenic of allcatheters used in veterinary medicine (Dolente et al. 2005). Nevertheless, catheter composition does not seem to be a risk factor for the occurrence of thrombosis in horses (Lankveld et al. 2001). The diagnosis of thrombophlebitis is based primarily on history and physical signs, principally localised rmness and a cord-like jugular vein (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). When bacteria become seeded in thrombi to produce a septic thrombophlebitis, affected horses can show fever, depression and neck stiffness. Other clinical signs include local swelling, and heat and pain around the cord-like jugular vein. The disease can be evaluated using ultrasonography and/or contrast angiograms. The sonographic feature is a thick- walled vein with an occlusive hyperechoic structure adhering to the vessel wall (Geraghty et al. 2009). A septic thrombus typically appears as a hyperechoic heterogeneous cavitating mass in which the anechoic areas represent fluid accumulation secondary to infection and necrosis. Anaerobic bacterial infections often show numerous hyperechoic areas, which creates an acoustic shadow due to gas production (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). Both medical and surgical treatments for thrombophlebitis are reported. Local treatment with hot packs and hydrotherapy can be useful while nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs may help to reduce pain and inflammation. Systemic antibiotics are indicated for sepsis and heparin therapy may be useful for generalised 2009; Dias and de Aspirin at a dose of 20 mg/kg bwt every other day is also recommended to inhibit platelet activation and aggregation (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). Other novel medical treatments using thrombolytic agents such as streptokinase, urokinase and tissue plasminogen activator have also been investigated (Morton 2005). Thrombolytic therapy consists of the pharmacological dissolution of the blood clot by i.v. infusion of the plasminogen activators to activate components of the intrinsic brinolytic system. However, further research is needed in horses when using these new brinolytic agents (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013). Surgical therapies for restoration of blood flow, which include balloon thrombectomy and a variety of vein transplantation techniques for replacing affected portions of the jugular with different types of graft, are typically ineffective and may only be achieved with complex and expensive procedures (Wiemer et al. 2005; Russell et al. 2010). In refractory cases, surgical excision of the vein has been recommended and recently, standing jugular phlebotomy for removal of septic contents has been reported (Russell et al. 2010). In the present case, surgical intervention was required after all medical treatment avenues had been exhausted. The standing phlebotomy technique was chosen since it had been reported to be a straightforward procedure with minimal post-operative complications (Russell et al. 2010). Fortunately, the athletic performance of horses used for nonracing events is not affected by thrombophlebitis,whether it is unilateral or bilateral (Moreau and Lavoie 2009). In bilateral cases, the lateral thoracic, cephalic and saphenous veins are other options for drug administration and the collection of venous blood samples (Dias and de Lacerda Neto 2013).

Charlesworth Hambleton the clinical, biochemical andhistopathological ndings of a case of disseminated, primary mycobacterial infection with Mycobacterium bovis in a pony presenting with neurological signs and weight loss. This reportrevisits tuberculosis as a potential differential diagnosis inhorses at a time of relatively strong tuberculosis control in theUK and iterates the importance of post-mortem examinationas a diagnostic tool for clinicians. Key public health questionsfollowing exposure to mycobacterial pathogens are alsodiscussed. Introduction of the tuberculosis (TB) complex. M. bovis can affect a wide host range including cattle and other ruminants, people, horses,badgers, cats, and dogs. The infection is noti able due to its zoonotic potential. Under high infection pressure, transmissionoccurs by respiration of aerosolised bacteria (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995), or by ingestion (Pavlik et al. 2004). Interspecies transmission between dead end hosts such as dogs, cats and people, amongst others, is reported but not well understood (De la Rua-Domenech 2005). Equine TB is rarely reported as a primary cause of disease in horses (Pavlik et al. 2008) probably due to a natural high resistance to infection (Anzai et al. 1989; Gunnes et al. 1995). Improved biosecurity of production animals in the UK has reduced the exposure of equids to mycobacterial pathogens (Mair et al. 1986). Current prevalence data relating to equine TB are lacking. In old reports, the incidence of granulomatous tubercles was 0.3% of 124 horses slaughtered in Germany (Schutzler 1954) and 2.3% of 214 horses in the Czech Republic (Krejci 1958). A shift between TB subtypes has been observed. 'Test and cull ' strategies on cattle farms have probably reduced thedominance of bTB (Mair et al. 1986; Pavlik et al. 2004) leading to the increasing diagnosis of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) pathogens amongst equids. Clinical signs ofdisease in equids relate to the duration and location ofinfection (Mair et al. 1986). Mostly lung, spleen and liver are involved; however, intrasynovial, ocular and cervicalabscesses have also been reported (Verge and Senthille1942; Krejci 1958; Pavlik et al. 2004). De nitive con rmation of disease is challenging since acid-fast bacteria are not alwaysdetected in submitted samples. The intradermal tuberculintest is considered unreliable in terms of sensitivity andspeci city in horses (Pavlik et al. 2004; Keck et al. 2010). This report aims to highlight bTB as a rare, potential equine pathogen and describes the clinical and histopathologicalfeatures of this UK case. Public health issues relating to bTB diagnosis are also discussed. Case report History A 23-year-old Fell pony gelding presented for weight loss withrecent onset depression. Weight loss was noted over the last6 months. During this period, the pony had one knownoccurrence of pyrexia (39.8 \u00b0C) with no haematological abnormalities. meglumine, (1.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.) by the attendingveterinarian. Historically, moderate signs of presumed equineasthma (recurrent airway obstruction) had been observed,although this was not considered a recent problem. A routinefaecal worm egg count 4 weeks prior to presentation wasnegative. The pony was retired and turned out at grass withfree access to stables located within 100 m proximity to anactive beef farm. Clinical ndings On presentation, the pony was markedly depressed with abody condition score of 2/9 (Henneke et al. 1983). abdominal distension and atrophy ofepaxial and postural musculature were noted. Clinical examination revealed a heart rate of 52 beats/ min, a respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and a rectaltemperature of 38.5 \u00b0C. Oral inspection showed hyperaemic mucous membranes with some ulceration in proximity to theincisors. There was some uneven tooth wear but no otherdental abnormalities were noted. On auscultation of thelungs increased bronchovesicular sounds were audiblebilaterally with occasional pleural rubs over the righthemithorax. Weakness and ataxia were evidenced byswaying at rest and the pony displayed a plaiting unsteadygait. No abnormalities were detected on cranial nerveevaluation. moderate pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) revealed an doi: 10.1111/eve.12786Additional work -up and treatment Based on the major clinical signs, laboratory parameters andthe rapid deterioration over the last 2 weeks signi cant inflammation or infection of the lungs and liver was presumed. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) was consideredmost likely due to obtunded mentation and extremeelevations in hepatobiliary enzymes, in conjunction withchronic, severe weight loss. Initial budget was limited.Treatment was focused on improving demeanour, combatingneurological signs, and reducing hepatic and airwayinflammation possibly associated with bacterial infection. Initial treatment on Day 1 included enteral fluid therapy via nasogastic tube (8 L water with electrolytes [one on ve more occasions within a 48-h period while other treatments were continued orally (dexamethasone 0.1 mg/kg per os s.i.d., flunixin and TMPS 20 mg/kg per osb.i.d.) for 3 more days. Appetite was stimulated by offeringfrequent small amounts of good quality hay and bre nuts. Improvements in mentation and ataxia were noted on Day 3 and the pony showed a better appetite. Oral flunixin meglumine (1.1 mg/kg bwt mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d.) were continued for another 2 days (Days 4 and 5). Oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg bwt per os s.i.d.) was substituted for dexamethasone from Day 5. During the following 10 days, the pony had occasional fever spikes (up to 42 \u00b0C) that were treated with oral or intravenous flunixin meglumine mg/kg ataxia presented onDay 10. Abdominocentesis was attempted (to rule out peritonitis) but was unsuccessful. The pony 's clinical parameters and demeanour improved following enteral fluids administered by nasogastric tube as previously described.With recurrent clinical signs and only marginal improvementsin repeat haematology and biochemistry values at Day 10,hepatic ultrasound and biopsy was elected by the owner. Transabdominal ultrasound was performed on Day 15 (3.5-MHz curvilinear probe) revealing a subjectively small space) with a subjectively hyperechoic parenchymous appearance. A single 3.8 cmanechoic structure compatible with an Echinococcus (hydatid) cyst could be imaged in the 14th intercostal spaceon the right side ( Fig 1 ). Three ultrasound guided percutaneous Tru-cut biopsies were collected and submitted for histopathology. Following biopsy, the pony remained on TMPS (20 mg/kg bwt per os b.i.d.) pending results. On Day 18, while awaiting the liver biopsy results, the pony deteriorated again, became recumbent and was subjected to euthanasia. A post-mortem examination was performed with samples collected for histopathology ( xed in 10% formal saline) and microbiology testing. Post-mortem examination Upon opening the abdomen many coalescing, white, raisednodules were present throughout approximately 60% of theperitoneal and mesenteric surfaces ( Fig 2 ). The liver appeared small and pale, containing four parenchymal cystic structures.Opening the cysts revealed they 3 ). Many white, granulomatous, caseous masses measuring approximately 1 -4 cm in diameter were presentthroughout the splenic parenchyma ( Fig 4 ). These masses extended into adjacent tissue as small nodules on juxtapositioned serosal surfaces. There was no evidence of adhesions or in flammation typical of peritonitis. Maximal small intestinal wall thickness was approximately 4 mm at one location. Two mesenteric lymph nodes appeared subjectively enlarged. Exploration of the thorax revealed identical cystic structures and white caseous masses spread throughout the lung and pleural surfaces. Bronchial walls were thickened on cut section. No other macroscopic abnormalities were detected. Histopathology Antemortem tru-cut liver biopsy specimens foci were seen. Ziehl these was positive for acid-fast bacilli. Thesamples were given a liver biopsy score of 4/14 (Durhamet al. 2003a,b).

Post-mortem examination ofhepatic tissue also identi ed acid-fast bacteria within focal microgranulomas and macrophages. compatible with Echinococcus cysts was also Post-mortem histopathology of lung tissue revealed severe, necrotising, granulomatous pneumonia. Moderate numbers of acid-fast bacilli were seen throughout the parenchymal tissue. In the alveolar tissue, parasitic protoscolices were seen as a result of cyst rupturing during post-mortem examination or processing. Splenic tissue also contained acid-fast bacilli ( Fig 5 ) evident within granulomatous, mineralising lesions with central necrotic zones. Microbiology and additional testing Paraf n embedded xed 10 lg sections of spleen were submitted to Leeds Teaching Hospital for mycobacterialpolymerase chain reaction (PCR; EliTech MTB Q-PCR Alert kit)and complex DNA. Further speci cation PCR The predominant clinical signs in this case included chronicweight loss and intermittent fever with more recent changesin mentation attributed to HE. Bile acid and ammoniaconcentrations were not measured in this case. A diagnosisof HE was made on the basis of extreme elevations inhepatobiliary enzymes in conjunction with clinical signs ofweight loss, obtunded demeanour, anorexia, hypersalivationand ataxia. These nonspeci c signs are frequently reported in cases of severe hepatic impairment (West 1996; Nout 2011).An objective diagnosis of however, other Fig 3: Post-mortem examination of a 4 cm echinococcus cyst within hepatic parenchyma as seen on ultrasound in Figure 1 . a) b) Fig 4: a) Post-mortem examination of the spleen revealing multiple, caseous Mycobacterium bovis granulomas <4c m diameter. b) section.

Asimilar staining of mycobacteria \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd194 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION AE / APRIL 201 8studies have concluded that hyperammonaemia is notconsistently a feature of HE (McGorum et al. 1999; Durham et al. 2003a,b) and serum ammonia is not accurately measurable in the general practice setting due to sampledegeneration in transport. It is likely that hepatic brosis and inflammatory in ltrates as a result of extensive hepatic inltration with bTB resulted in impaired liver function in this case, possibly resulting in concomitant signs of HE. Subsequent reduced ef ciency of protein synthesis and conversion likely resulted in weight loss and reduced albumin concentrations. Weight loss and intermittent pyrexia are well-documented signs of bTB in multiple species (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995). This is presumably on the basis of negative energy balance due to reduced appetite and part of a systemic in flammatory response syndrome (Van Creval et al. 2002). This is supported in this case by the in flammatory leucogram and hyperglobulinaemia. In addition, weight loss may have been a feature of PPID associated catabolism. Pleural rubs and tachypnoea were likely present due to severe, necrotising, granulomatous pneumonia identi ed on histopathology less so, spaceoccupying Echinococcus cysts. Exacerbation of a previously hypersensitive airway (recurrent airway obstruction history) dueto systemic in flammatory response syndrome might also have contributed (Papi et al. 2006). In addition, bronchointerstitial inflammation and bronchiolitis have been identi ed in PPID affected equids at post-mortem examination (Glover et al. 2009). It is hypothesised this is a consequence of the generalised in flammatory dysregulation that occurs in PPID and may be an additional contributing factor in this case. Mycobacterial infection in equids The mode of transmission of mycobacterial infections in horsesis unclear (M \u20aconki et al. 2016). An oral route of infection in equids is most likely (Pavlik et al. 2008) with subsequent haematogenous spread accountable for the diversity of organotropisms. Environmental contamination can occur through deposition of secretions from infective hosts or carcasses including sputum, excrement and purulent material (P/C19erez-Lago et al. 2014) .A known history of bTB infected cattle on the adjacent farm was reported by the owner. This may represent a long-standing potential source of environmental infection. Clinical history and post-mortem examination ndings in this case indicated a chronic state of infection. bTB can be a slow, insidious disease and remain dormant for many years (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995), the precise time of infection therefore remains uncertain. It is plausible that initial exposure may have occurred many years previously. In man, immune suppression is regarded a prerequisite for clinical disease (Xu et al. 2014). Opportunistic or secondary infections occur in approximately 35% (63 of 180) of horses with PPID compared with 11% (4 of 33) of healthy agedhorses (Glover 2009). Consequently, the possibility of a predisposition to Echinococcus and bTB secondary to PPID cannot be ruled out in this case. Other reports have not described mycobacterial disease with concurrent PPID. Echinococcus Echinococcus cysts are frequently clinically normal equids. Large echinococcus cysts have been implicated as a possible cause of clinical hepatic disease due to compression and expansion within tissue (Sellon and Long2013); however, Echinococcus cysts are unlikely to have been the cause of signi cant hepatic compromise in this case. No previous reports describe Echinococcus in conjunction with equine TB and these ndings are probably unrelated. The intrinsic immunity of individual horses in fluences the extent of parasite burdens. Equids with PPID have been shown to have higher faecal egg counts, suggesting that they could be more susceptible to endoparasitism (McFarlane 2011), potentially explaining the presence of multiple Echinococcus cysts in this case. Public health and professional relevance Mycobacterium bovis represents a known risk to public health and huge nancial and logistic resources are dedicated to monitoring and eradication programmes. Consequently,people working in the agricultural and animal health sectors,including veterinarians are at an increased exposure risk. Acase study in 2010 produced by the University of Berndescribed mycobacterial infection in three vets followingnecropsy of an infected dog, clearly highlighting theimportance of disease awareness (Posthaus et al. 2011). At this establishment, a new protocol for assessing risk of zoonoticdisease prior to necropsy has been installed to help mitigaterisk to personnel. The wearing of gloves and face masks tocover the eyes and nose should be a compulsory componentof post-mortem examination to minimise potential exposure toinfectious organisms (Whitwell 2009). In the UK all suspectedcases of TB should be reported to The Animal and Plant HealthAgency (APHA). The APHA recommends potentially exposedindividuals undertake an infection-risk questionnaire viatelephone with the local APHA of ce. Testing blood or intra dermal testing of exposed individuals is advised and funded by the APHA on a relative-risk basis taking into account factors such as age, degree and chronicity of exposure, vaccination status and presence of other illnesses. Suspected infectious samples (containing acid fast bacteria), should be submitted for species subtyping by PCR to assist in TB species monitoring in the UK. Mycobacterial PCR can be performed at Cardiff, Edinburgh and Leeds teaching hospitals. The treating vet in this case underwent mycobacterial antibody serology as deemed appropriate by the APHA and tested negative. The pony 's owner and her husband underwent intradermal skin testing that indicated exposure. Subsequent antibody serology was negative. Advice relating to appropriate biosecurity measures in terms of other horses is lacking and given the low risk propensity of TB infection in equids if cohorts appear clinically normal and in good body condition, then a disease free state can probably be assumed.

WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO BE CERTAINClinical Commentary Mycobacterial infections in equids: Clinical characteristics anddiagnostic techniques D. G. M. Sutton*and A. L. Michel Weipers Centre Equine Hospital, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK; andBovine Tuberculosis and Brucellosis Research Programme, Department of Veterinary Tropical Disease, Faculty of Veterinary Science, University of Pretoria, Pretoria,South Africa. *Corresponding author email: david.sutton@glasgow.ac.uk Summary Mycobacterial infections in equids are relatively rare but thecase report (Charlesworth 2018) detailed in this issue highlightsthat Mycobacterium bovis infections may still result in clinical signs in this incidental host and have zoonotic potential. Mostreported cases of M. bovis in horses have a protracted disease course, with features including pyrexia, weight loss and oedema with a nonspeci ci nflammatory pro le. As such, the clinical features of disease overlap with conditions such asneoplasia, peritonitis, this clinical satellite article, mycobacterial infections in equids are considered in terms of incidence andmode of transmission, key clinical features and perhaps mostimportantly, in terms of the diagnostic techniques that can beused in order to reach a de nitive (ante mortem) diagnosis. The major zoonotic risk to veterinary personnel is likely to occur at the time of post-mortem examination of infected horses, and awareness of these potential risks remains of the utmost importance. Mycobacterial infections rarely feature in lists of differential diagnoses in equine medicine, but in this issue, a case of multisystemic bovine tuberculosis in a pony residing in the UKis reported (Charlesworth 2018). Historically, prior to improved control measures for Mycobacterium bovis, the reported incidence of granulomatous tubercles in the viscera of equine specimens was as high as 2% in one Czech abattoir survey (Krejci 1958), with equine infection rates linked to stocking densities of co-grazing infected cattle. The widespread implementation of the intradermal tuberculin test for cattle with culling of positive reactors is likely to account for the drop off in con rmed cases of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in horses, such that mycobacteria in the avian complex (MAC) have become relatively more important in this species (Pavlik et al. 2004, 2008; Kriz et al. 2010; M \u20aconki et al. 2016). The case reported here highlights the fact that horses may still contract and harbour M. bovis for prolonged periods of time during which the infection may be activated and result in clinical manifestation. Due vigilance is required by equine veterinarians due to the zoonotic nature of M. bovis infection. The main route of infection for bTB in horses is thought to be ingestion (Sarradell et al. 2015) with the primary disease complex developing in the intestine and mesenteric lymph nodes (Monreal et al. 2001) then leading to faecal shedding of organisms. The pulmonary form of the disease inequids is more likely to occur via aerosol transmission from infected cattle (Keck et al. 2010; Hlokwe et al. 2016) and may present a greater zoonotic risk to personnel in close contact than the intestinal form. Horses and other perissodactyls have been considered to be relatively resistant to M. bovis infection compared with other domestic and wild animal species (O 'Reilly and Daborn 1995; Michel et al. 2017). In the case reported here, the affected pony had concurrent pars pituitary intermedia dysfunction (PPID), which has been linked anecdotally to higher incidence of secondary infections (McFarlane 2011) and increased severity of fungal (Randleff-Rasmussen et al. 2017) and parasitic disease (McFarlane et al. 2010; Raftery et al. 2015). Horses with PPID have been demonstrated to have less effective neutrophil activity due to reduced oxidative burst and impaired chemotaxis (McFarlane et al. 2015). A familial immunode ciency was also suspected to be present in two sibling Fjord horses, both of which developed enteric infection with Mycobacterium avium subsp. hominissuis (Kriz et al. 2010). Clinical disease in humans infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is much higher among HIV- positive individuals (WHO 2009). Characterisation of the immune response to different pathogens is required in equine PPID, but it would be reasonable to expect that this de ned population may be at increased risk of developing clinical signs of mycobacterial disease in the face of suf cient challenge. The effect of pergolide treatment on cell mediatedimmunity in PPID ponies has still to be proven. Clinical signs The clinical signs of M. bovis infection in horses are variable depending on the primary organ affected and whether or notthere is generalised infection. Alimentary infections causegranulomatous enterocolitis resulting lethargy, and pyrexia withinsidious progression (Sarradell et al. 2015; M \u20aconki et al. 2016). Mesenteric lymph nodes are likely to be enlarged on palpationper rectum and there may be a nodular pro le to the spleen. The disease course may last several months with progressivewasting and ventral oedema. Key differential peritonitis, protein-losingenteropathies and Lawsonia intracellularis infections in younger horses. Pulmonary infections may cause coughing, pyrexia and epistaxis if there is a single tuberculous granuloma (Hlokwe et al. 2016), whereas secondary miliary pulmonary in ltration results in 10.1111/eve.12839discharge and exercise intolerance (Lyashchenko et al. 2012). Differential diagnoses for pulmonary infection may includeneoplasia, pleuropneumonia or Rhodococcus equi infection in foals. Haematogenous dissemination of infection results inadvanced disease with the appearance of miliary or nodulartubercles in all the viscera and lymph nodes; this results in rapiddeterioration due to multiple organ failure. Signi cant hepatopathy resulted in signs of hepatic encephalopathy inthe case reported here, demonstrating again the variability ofclinical presentation. Pulmonary tuberculosis should beconsidered in the differential diagnosis for horses presentingwith respiratory distress, an in flammatory pro le and diffuse multinodular pulmonary densities, particularly if there isconcurrent immunosuppression. Zoonotic concerns of equine tuberculosis Horses with pulmonary disease are most commonly affectedbyM. bovis ;M. tuberculosis infection is rare (Lyashchenko et al. 2012). We are not aware of any reports of other members of the M. tuberculosis complex as a cause of tuberculosis in horses. Direct transmission of either M. bovis or M. tuberculosis infection from horse to handlers has not been con rmed, but post-mortem evaluation of infected animals does carry a signi cant zoonotic risk as opening the thorax, abdomen or cranium may aerosolise infected droplets. Three veterinary personnel acquired M. tuberculosis following post- mortem examination of a dog with central nervous systeminfection (Posthaus et al. 2011). Horses suspected to be positive for tuberculosis should be reported to the APHA, andappropriate care taken if undertaking a post-mortemprocedure. On con rmation of a horse with tuberculosis, the relative exposure risk should be determined for all personneland livestock that have been in contact due to theimplications of zoonotic infection. An interferon-gammarelease assay (IGRA) is the test of choice to run on bloodsamples from in-contact human subjects: this interferon isincreased if peripheral lymphocytes have been sensitised toM. tuberculosis complex antigens (Posthaus et al. 2011). Chest radiographs should be obtained from human patients with a positive test result in order to exclude active TB. Diagnostic investigation The positive con rmation of mycobacterial infection in horses ante mortem requires proactive inclusion of this infection on thedifferential diagnosis list and a logical approach tocomprehensive evaluation. Biochemical and haematologicalevaluation of equids presenting with tuberculosis diseasecaused by M. bovis is not speci c but is likely to reveal a chronic inflammatory response in both alimentary and respiratory disease, plus hypoalbuminaemia, hyperglobulinaemia andvariable increases in hepatic enzymes in the former dependingon extent of organ in ltration. Detection of features such as thickening of the wall of the small or large intestine and mesenteric lymph node enlargement (M \u20aconki et al. 2016) or granulomatous hepatic/ splenic densities on ultrasound examination of the abdomen should increase the suspicion of mycobacterial involvement. Similarly, detection of multiple areas of pulmonary consolidation on thoracic ultrasound should increase the suspicion of pulmonary bTB or MAC involvement, and thoracic radiographs should be obtained. Detection of eitheran alveolar pattern or focal mass on thoracic radiographs, in combination with the clinicopathological features as described, should further increase the suspicion of mycobacterial involvement ( Fig 1 ). Histopathological examination biopsy with Ziehl -Neelsen staining for acid-fast bacteria efcient means of con rming alimentary bTB, but false negatives are common. Nonetheless, histopathological detection of multinucleated giant cells and lymphocyte and plasma cell aggregates in the lamina propriae mucosae (Sarradell et al. 2015) may be further indicative of bTB involvement. In the report by Charlesworth (2018), hepatic biopsies were collected ante mortem and histopathology revealed pyogranulomatous in flammatory foci containing acid-fast bacilli, thus con rming the pony 's zoonotic potential. In the case of miliary pulmonary TB in equids, acid-fast bacilli may be detected in a tracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen, although sensitivity is likely to be much higher if a tru-cut lung biopsy is submitted for histopathology. The latter approach has the advantage of ruling out other differential diagnoses such as neoplasia or equine multinodular pulmonary brosis in the case of nodular lung disease. Tracheal wash specimens (or pleural effusions if present) should also be submitted for mycobacterial culture if characteristic radiographic changes have been noted. The major clinical limitation of mycobacterial culture is that 4 -6 weeks may be required for positive results due to the slow doubling time of this organism (Gazi et al. 2015). Concurrent culture of secondary bacterial pathogens may also confuse the interpretation of initial results. Positive ante mortem con rmation of mycobacterial infection may therefore be dif cult in horses. The intradermal tuberculin test is not reliable in this species (Konyha and Kreier 1971) and serological response to infection has not been fully elucidated. Fig 1: Lateral radiograph of the caudodorsal lung of a pony presenting with dyspnoea and pyrexia, in which a diffuse alveolarpattern is present. Histopathological examination of a tru-cutbiopsy with Ziehl -Neelsen staining was used to rule out mycobacterial involvement in this case and the pony was treatedsubsequently for interstitial pneumonia. \u00a92017 EVJ Ltd198 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8Molecular techniques Depending on the bacterial load present in bronchialwashings or other clinical specimens polymerase chainreaction (PCR) may be a useful tool for the rapid and directdetection of M. bovis. Tuberculosis can, however, not be ruled out based on a negative test result, and evenhistopathological evaluation has imperfect sensitivity. In thesecases, both the sensitivity and speci city of diagnosis can be greatly enhanced by subjecting DNA extracted fromhistopathological granulomatous like lesions to PCR. Strain typing Isolation and genetic characterisation of the causativeM. bovis strain, for example, by spoligotyping and MIRU-VNTR typing offers a valuable tool for tracing back sources of bTBoutbreaks in domestic and wild animals and for studying thetransmission between animal species (Hlokwe et al. 2013). Although not performed in the present case study, the isolation of M. bovis from the pony would have allowed for strain comparison with the bTB infection in the cattle on the adjacent property and for potential con rmation of the source of infection.

D. H. Parkin*, J. Brownand E. B. Macdonald Weipers Centre Equine Hospital, School of Veterinary Medicine, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow; andHealthy Working Lives Group, Institute of Health and Wellbeing, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK*Corresponding author email: tim.parkin@glasgow.ac.uk Summary Limited scienti c evidence from other countries and plenty of anecdotal evidence suggest that the risk of personal injury inequine veterinary practice is high. However, a comprehensivedescription of the types of risks to which equine veterinarysurgeons expose themselves has not previously beenavailable. The aim of this study was to quantify the number,types and causes of personal injury sustained by equineveterinary practitioners in the UK. An interview (and online)questionnaire-based survey was conducted with a largenumber of equine veterinary practitioners. Questions weredesigned to identify the number of injuries sustained during therespondent 's career to date and to acquire details of the worst injury sustained including cause, treatment and short- and long-term outcomes. A total of 2292 injuries were reported by 620 respondents, equating to one injury every 3 years 7 months in those respondents. Most 'worst 'injuries occurred while the veterinary surgeon was conducting most commonreasons for equine examination. The most frequent sites of this 'worst 'injury were the leg and the head with the main cause of injury being a kick with hindlimb. Of all reports, 33% of injuries resulted in a hospital admission of which 43% required hospital admission for longer than 24 h and 7% of reports resulted in a loss of consciousness. The main limitation of this work is the descriptive nature of the survey. It would be unwise to assume that the procedures identi ed as being most commonly associated with injury in the study are more risky than other less commonly conducted procedures. In conclusion, equine veterinary practice is a risky profession. Greater emphasis on and awareness of methods to avoid or mitigate risk should be a priority for anyone working with horses and their employers. Introduction Recent work indicates that veterinary practitioners involved inequine work sustain signi cant numbers of injuries as part of their work with horses (Mohammed et al. 2002; Jaeggin et al. 2005; Loomans et al. 2008; Lucas et al. 2009a). There is a perception that equine practice is inherently risky and that some risk is taken for granted by current equine practitioners (Loomans et al. 2008). This is of concern and indicates that greater efforts to raise awareness of the level of risk and consequences of some equine-related injury should be a focus of this sector to the veterinary community. A study fromthe USA described occupational injuries in Thoroughbred horse farms (Swanberg et al. 2013). The study was particularlyinterested in the description of Latino and non-Latino workers ' experiences and showed that general injuries and musculoskeletal strains, sprains and tears account for the majority of injuries among workers on Thoroughbred farms. Further work from Germany investigated the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders and work-related accidents in all veterinarians, concluding that targeted advice to speci c groups of veterinarians about risk prevention measures was required (Kozak et al. 2014). Further studies have investigated the risk of injury or trauma associated with general veterinary practice (Landercasper et al. 1988; Nienhaus et al. 2005; Fritschi et al. 2006; Lucas et al. 2009b) or more generally those working with (Swanberg et al. 2016) or coming into contact with horses (Griffen et al. 2002). Some of these studies have identi ed that injuries associated with large animals are more likely to be of serious consequence and others have gone on to identify risk factors for either severe or speci cally large animal related injury. To the authors 'knowledge, the prevalence and type of injuries incurred by veterinarians working in equine practice in the UK has not previously been described or quanti ed. Knowledge of the risks involved will better inform equine veterinary surgeons of the risks to which they are exposed, enabling them to take preventive measures which will include full and thorough risk assessments and potentially the use of personal protective equipment in certain situations. Potential recruits, who are considering a career in equine practice, will also be able to make more informed decisions on their chosen profession. Importantly, this work should also form the basis of client -vet communication ensuring that horse-owners understand the potential risk, providing greater justication for the use of appropriate sedation or other risk mitigation measures as a routine part of equine veterinary practice in speci c circumstances. The aim of the study was to describe and quantify the frequency of equine work-related injury or illness in practicing equine veterinary surgeons in the UK. Materials and methods The survey A Work-Related Injuries in Equine Practitioners 'Questionnaire was developed and piloted on approximately 20 equineveterinary surgeons in July 2013. The questionnaire wasnalised and developed into an online format using SmartSurvey 1online survey software in September 2013. \u00a92018 doi: 10.1111/eve.12891Survey sample The sampling frame for this study was all veterinary surgeonsworking with horses in the UK. Two approaches were used totarget this population. Firstly, delegates at the BEVA annualconference held in September 2013 were interviewed inperson. Secondly, following the conference, an email wassent to all BEVA members with a link to the questionnaire. A total of 751 veterinary surgeons attended the British Equine Veterinary Association annual conference inSeptember 2013. Five veterinary students asked BEVAdelegates to complete the questionnaire on a handhelddevice. Following the conference, the questionnaire wasfeatured in the BEVA E-news and members who had notcompleted the questionnaire at the conference were invitedto complete the questionnaire online. Emails were sent toapproximately 1700 BEVA members on three separateoccasions in the 6 weeks after the conference withinformation on the study and a link to complete thequestionnaire. A copy of the questionnaire is included assupporting information ( Supplementary Item 1 ). Denition of injury The following de nition of an injury was used: \"An injury or event that required (self) treatment and/or resulted in time offwork \". Participants were asked to list all anatomical sites ever injured and then asked to focus on further description of what they considered to be their worst injury. Data analysis Simple descriptive analyses were conducted for categoricaland continuous variables, as appropriate. Text miningtechniques were employed to categorise methods that couldbe employed to make equine practice safer, using Wordstat/Simstat software (Provalis research 2). This involved reviewing answers to this question and creating groups of words thateffectively categorised responses into separate themesbased on the speci c text used by each respondent. Results Survey respondents In total, 623 questionnaires were completed. Threequestionnaires were removed from the analyses as they werecompleted by veterinary nurses, resulting in 620 questionnaires, completed by current practicing equine vets, included in the study. Of these, 302 (49%) were completed at the BEVA conference (12 -14 September 2013) and 318 (51%) online between 16 September 2013 and 20 November 2013. Of all respondents, 55% were female, the median age was 37 years, the median length of time employed as an equine practitioner was 11 years and 85% of respondents were working full-time ( Table 1 ). All injuries sustained Across all 620 valid respondents, a total of 2292 injuries werereported in a total 8204 years working as a veterinary surgeonwith horses (representing the total number of years worked inequine practice by those 620 respondents -i.e. the sum of the 620 responses to the question about the number of yearsworking as an equine practitioner). This equates to one injuryevery 3 years 7 months working with horses in thoserespondents. Over a working life-time of 30 years, a veterinarysurgeon working with horses may therefore expect to sustainbetween eight and nine injuries that require (self) treatmentand/or result in time off work. Of 620 respondents, 495 stated that they had sustained at least one injury while working with horses during theirveterinary career. As one might expect, the mean totalnumber of injuries sustained increased as the number of yearsin equine practice increased ( Table 1 ). The mean number of injuries sustained by all 620 respondents was 3.7 injuries. Atotal of 617 respondents reported the number of years theyhad spent in equine practice (a total of 2284 injuries). Forthose with up to 5 years in equine practice, the averagenumber of injuries sustained was 0.83 per year, for those with5-10 years in equine practice, the average number of injuries sustained was 0.47 per year but for those with at least15 years in equine practice the number of injuries sustainedwas between 0.18 and 0.22 per year ( Fig 1 ). Details of the 'worst 'injury sustained by respondents When injury occurred and purpose of examination beingconductedThe majority of worst injuries (77%) were sustained byveterinary surgeons who were employed (i.e. not self-employed) at the time of injury and 88% of these TABLE 1: Sex, age, length of time employed as equine practitioner, work status and mean number of injuries in veterinary surgeons with a range of years of experience Number % of total Sex Male 278 44.9 Female 341 55.1 Work status Full-time 525 85.0 Part-time 93 15.0 Median Mean Age 37 39.0 Length of time employed as an equine veterinary practitioner (years) 11 13.3 Length of time employed as an equine veterinary practitioner: Number of vets Mean number of injuries sustained <5 years 144 1.7 5<10 years 122 3.1 10<15 years 115 4.3 15<20 years 78 3.1 20<25 years 58 4.7 25<30 years 40 4.9 30 years 60 7.7 \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd201 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8injuries occurred during normal working hours (i.e. not whileon call). Table 2 shows a summary of the 'environment 'when the injury occurred and the purpose of examination. In summary,38% of injuries occurred while the veterinary surgeon wasdoing 'pleasure horse work '; 37% of injuries occurred while the horse was sedated; 30% of respondents said that anotherform of restraint was being used (59% of which was a twitch,23% of which were using stocks). Most frequently (48% of allresponses), the owner or client was the horse handler at thetime of the injury, followed by groom (19%) and veterinarynurse (15%). The most common reasons for examination at the time of the worst injury were foot lameness (11%) and dentalexamination (7%), followed by other very commonprocedures that the normal equine veterinary practitionerwould be doing on a regular basis ( Table 2 ). Anatomical site, cause and treatment of injuryThe most frequent sites of this 'worst 'injury were the leg (29% of all responses), head (23%) or hand (10%). Most injuries weredescribed as bruising (44% of all injuries), fracture (22%) orlaceration (17%). The main cause of injury was a kick withhindlimb (49%), followed by strike with forelimb (12%) andcrush (5%). responses relating 22% required treatment forfracture and 21% involved physiotherapy ( Table 3 ). In addition to the more frequent outcomes listed in Table 3 ,n o treatment was required in 13 cases, rest alone was reportedas being required in eight cases, self-treatment was reportedas the sole outcome in nine cases, dental work was requiredin ve cases and three respondents reported 'other ' treatment. The remaining 108 respondents gave details of animmediate outcome (see below) without making referenceto speci c treatments. Immediate outcome of injuryOf all reports, 33% of injuries resulted in a hospital admission ofwhich 43% (71 cases) required hospital admission for longerthan 24 h. GP attendance was required in 16% of cases and 7% of injuries resulted in a loss of consciousness ( Table 3 ). Post injury and return to work A total of 44% of respondents were unable to return to work immediately after their 'worst 'injury. The median length of time off work was 7 days. The median length of time to return to a full range of duties was 18 days and the median length of time to become fully recovered was 21 days. An accident form was completed by 37% of respondents but only 14% of injuries were reported to the Health and Safety Executive. Alternative work, at least for some period of time, had to be taken by 8% of respondents. Only 7% of injured vets received occupational health advice and the same percentage received advice about return to work, whereas 22% ofrespondents stated that the injury had an impact on their psychological wellbeing. General/current health of participants and other chronic injuries/illnesses attributable to equine veterinary work In general, the vast majority of respondents (91%) rated theirhealth as very good or good. Almost one-third (32%) ofrespondents knew of an equine veterinary practitionercolleague who had given up equine work, veterinary workaltogether, retired or had been killed as a result of an injurysustained while working with a horse and 31% of respondentssaid they had chronic injuries or illnesses attributable toequine veterinary work.

Discussion The current work suggests that over a 30-year working life anequine veterinary surgeon can expect to sustain betweenseven and eight injuries. The severity of these injuries willclearly be very variable and indeed many equine veterinarysurgeons may never sustain an injury that results inhospitalisation or a loss of consciousness. However, it isundoubtedly the case that a signi cant proportion of equine veterinary surgeons will at some point in their career end upunconscious or hospitalised following an injury directly relatedto their work. Most injuries were described as bruising, fractureand laceration. The main cause of injury was a kick withhindlimb followed by strike with forelimb and crush. Theseresults concur with previous studies (Landercasper et al. 1988; Lucas et al. 2009a, 2009b) which also indicated that themore severe injuries were most likely to affect large animal (or speci cally equine) practitioners. When examining the number of injuries per year strati ed by years in equine practice, it is apparent that those in their rst 5 years were at greatest risk, certainly compared with those who had more than 15 years of experience. It is important to acknowledge the wide standard deviation around the risk estimate for the least experienced veterinary surgeons, indicating a lot of variation in the number of injuries per year per respondent in that group. Nevertheless, it is useful to speculate why the injury risk apparently decreases over time. This may be due to greater experience and understanding of risky procedures as one works for longer with horses. It may also be related to work patterns with junior veterinary surgeons perhaps taking on more routine, but potentially more risky procedures, such as standing castrations or indeed seeing a greater case-load compared with very experienced veterinary surgeons.

Although this current study identi ed a list of procedures most commonly associated with injury, it is important to recognise that this should not be taken to mean that other procedures are not risky. This list, at least to some extent, simply represents the common procedures undertaken by equine veterinary surgeons. A control population of uninjured veterinary surgeons was not available to enable an analysis of different procedures as risk factors for injury, so it would be unwise to only focus on the procedures listed as risky in this work. It is much more important that the message is reiterated that simply working as an equine veterinary surgeon, in close proximity to horses, is risky. It might be an obvious statement to make but given the severity of some injuries it is important to reiterate this fact. A common method of reporting accident risks by occupational group is that of accident rates where the number of individuals injured per 100,000 employees per year is estimated. In this study, we have estimated that each veterinary surgeon in equine practice would sustain an injury every 3 years 7 months (0.27 injuries per year). This equates to approximately 27,000 injuries per 100,000 employees per annum. Even if we assume all nonrespondents to the survey had experienced no injuries, which is highly improbable, and that there are currently approximately 3000 veterinary surgeons engaged in equine practice in the UK, the accident rate is still approximately 5,400 per 100,000 per annum. Evenat the lower estimate, comparison with the actively acquired annual Labour Force Survey data (http://www.hse.gov.uk/sta tistics/lfs/index.htm#allinjuries) indicates that equine veterinary practice is one of the most hazardous civilian occupations: equivalent gures for Prison Service personnel (below principal of cer) -10,760 per 100,000 pa; Police (Sergeant and below) -8700; Welding and metal formers -6980; Skilled construction workers -4760 and Farm workers -4620). The signi cant lack of reporting to the Health and Safety Executive is of concern. However, it is now critical that a spotlight is shone on the risks associated with equine practice as the consequences for some are extremely serious. It is obvious that risk cannot be completely eliminated. The work requires close handling of large, heavy animals, often behaving unpredictably, who may be distressed and in pain. Direct observation of the working environment, by the authors at the Weipers Centre Equine Hospital, con rms that animal handlers adopt a manner of easy con dence and intimacy with the horse, as a means of reassurance to the animal, but clearly more safeguards are required. Of concern is the incidence of serious injuries such as fractures, head injury, unconsciousness, loss of vision, and the anecdotal accounts of veterinary surgeons who have had to give up practice, or move to less physically demanding work. This study con rms that equine veterinary work is inherently dangerous, is associated with an unacceptable risk of injury and that preventive measures are urgently required to improve the safety of the workforce. Equine practice requires adoption of the principles of health and safety management and risk minimisation to a much greater degree than is currently the case. While some procedures are less risky than others, in general most of the equine-related activities routinely undertaken by equine veterinary surgeons areassociated with risk and generic health and safety measures are required.Health and safety legislation requires employers to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety and health of workers and to have a health and safety management system that incorporates risk assessment, risk management and monitoring procedures. All practitioners and employers should consider the following guiding principles throughout the risk assessment process: Step 1. Identifying hazards and those at risk This study has identi ed high levels of risk of injury and some activities that may be associated with greater risk, and thatequine veterinary surgeons, and most probably other equinehandlers, are at risk. Step 2. Evaluating and prioritising risks Estimating the existing risks (their severity and their probability)and prioritising them in order of importance. It is essential thatthe work required to eliminate or prevent risks is prioritised. Step 3. Deciding on preventive action Identifying the appropriate measures to eliminate or controlthe risks. The issue of whether to sedate or not sedate horsesundergoing procedures was one of the reasons for this studyand the evidence would support the selective use ofsedation. Workplace layout and organisation is important butmay be a factor outside of the veterinary surgeon 's control when attending a distressed animal in a eld or stables. A detailed analysis of high risk activities and the development of guidelines and standard operatingprocedures, based on best available knowledge andevidence, aimed at minimising risk are required. Personal protective equipment (PPE) may need to be worn in some circumstances and could include safetyfootwear, gloves, protective helmets, eye protection andpersonal protective clothing. However, it is much moreappropriate to avoid risky situations or modify a riskyenvironment such that PPE is used as a last resort where riskcannot be minimised. Step 4. Taking action All equine workers require training in safe handling of horsesand injury prevention, risk assessment and the use of PPE. Theimplementation of preventive and protective measuresthrough a prioritisation plan and specifying who does whatand when, when a task is to be completed and the meansallocated to implement the measures is a critical step in workaimed at minimising workplace injury. Step 5. Monitoring and reviewing The impact of the preventive measures must be monitoredto ensure compliance with safe working procedures,accurately recording and reporting of injuries and minorincidents and also importantly 'near miss 'events. Training of students and all staff should occur regularly. Performance with regard to health and safety should be regularly reviewed and the philosophy should be that of continuous improvement. Limitations of this work The study was not designed to identify risk factors for injuryand this might be the next logical research direction for thiswork, but this would ideally require a reasonably large cohort \u00a92018 EVJ Ltd204 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8of veterinary surgeons willing to complete daily record sheetsof all procedures undertaken and all injuries (however minor)sustained for a signi cant amount of time and this might be difcult to establish and maintain. It was not possible to conduct any nonresponder bias analysis during this study as all responses were anonymoussuch that we had no method of identifying and following upindividuals who had not yet responded to the survey. Conclusion Being an equine veterinary surgeon is clearly not without risk.This study has con rmed that there are high injury rates and that serious and potentially fatal injuries are not uncommon.The current work suggests that over a 30-year working life anequine vet can expect to sustain between seven and eightinjuries. The severity of these injuries will clearly be veryvariable and indeed most equine veterinary surgeons maynever sustain an injury that results in hospitalisation or a lossof consciousness. However, there were suf cient reports of very serious injury providing food for thought for theprofession as a whole and in particular employers of thoseat risk. There is a need to establish safer systems of work, andintensive education of the profession and other animalhandlers. This survey was completed by practising equineveterinary surgeons who can be regarded as a 'survivor ' population in that others (not available for survey) will have left equine practice as a result of previous injuries. As such, the estimates of risk in this study may well be underestimates of the true level of risk. Particular emphasis is required in the training of veterinary students and newly quali ed equine veterinary surgeons to ensure they are aware of the risksassociated with equine practice and methods they shouldemploy to avoid injury and remain safe while working withhorses.

The EGGD mild depression in the ventralglandular fundus. ESGD was primary in all the donkeysincluded and lesions were located around the cardia andalong the lesser curvature. Gasterophilus sp. larvae were present in all animals identi ed as third-stage larvae ofGasterophilus intestinalis . No equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS). No signi cant differences relating to sex, age or breed were found in the prevalence of EGUS in this study, while the proportion of donkeys affected by ESGD was statistically higher than those affected by EGGD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst report on the gastroscopic evaluation of EGUS in live donkeys. Our results show a higher prevalence of EGUS in live donkeys than values previously reported by other authors in donkeys that were dead or had been subjected to euthanasia. The detection of third-stage G. intestinalis larvae was not unexpected since these can be found in the stomach of equids throughout the year, and G. intestinalis has been reported as the most common Gasterophilus sp. in Italy. Introduction Worldwide interest in the welfare of donkeys ( Equus asinus ) has been increasing mostly because of the recent new useof these animals for milk production for use in children withintolerance to cow 's milk (Carroccio et al. 2000; Muraro et al. 2002; Monti et al. 2012) or in animal-assisted therapy and activities (Borioni et al. 2012). The renewed interest in these animals is demonstrated by the number of different types of studies carried out in various countries including Italy over the last 10 years (Nardoni et al. 2007; Laus et al. al. 2014; Carluccio al. al. 2016). Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is the most common disease of the equine stomach with a high prevalence reported in sport horses (Bezdukova et al. 2005; Bell et al. 2007; Tamzali et al. 2011; Cate et al. 2012; Sykes et al. 2015) as well as in leisure horses, breeding mares and young horses (Le Jeune et al. 2009; Luthersson et al. 2009; al. 2013). The term equine gastric ulcer syndrome was rst adopted by the EGUS Council in 1999 (Andrews et al. 1999). It includes a set of pathological conditions characterised by ulcers in the terminal portion of the oesophagus, in the proximal (squamous) and distal (glandular) parts of the stomach, and in the proximal part of the duodenum of equids (Andrews et al. 1999). Various authors (Sykes and Jokisalo 2014, 2015a,b) and the European College of Equine Internal Medicine Consensus Statement (Sykes et al. 2015) have provided a new nomenclature of EGUS, and have proposed updated guidelines regarding pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment. Equine gastric ulcer syndrome appears to have been rarely described in donkeys, and ndings are limited to animals submitted for necropsy (Burden et al. 2009; Morrow et al. 2011; Al-Mokaddem et al. 2014; Morales Brice ~noet al. 2015). Thus, in order to provide further insight, we investigated the prevalence and anatomical distribution of EGUS in a cohort of 39 live adult donkeys. The effect of age and sex was also investigated. Materials and methods The study was performed between April 2014 and March2016 and was approved by the Ethics Committee of theUniversity of Pisa (No. 9069/2014). Owner 's written consent was also obtained for performing a gastroscopy on thedonkeys included. \u00a92017 donkeys donkeys n =33, and cross- bred donkeys n =6) with no clinical signs of EGUS, underwent gastroscopic examination to evaluate the presence of gastric lesions. The animals were not selected randomly, and an opportunistic sampling strategy was adopted. Seventeen out of 39 donkeys were owned by the regional authority and administrative body of Tuscany (Italy). The donkeys were permanently housed at the Department of Veterinary Sciences '(13/39) or regional authority 's stud farm facilities in Pisa (4/39) for reproduction activities. The remaining donkeys (22/39) were owned by two private stud farms located in Camerino and Perugia, also used for reproduction activities. All the donkeys were eligible to participate in the study (see study inclusion criteria below), and were thus recruited. All the animals were kept in sand paddocks for at least one year before the gastroscopy. Jennies were grouped (5 or 6 animals/paddock), while jacks were housed in single small paddocks maintaining eye contact with the other animals. All the donkeys were fed meadow hay ad libitum and commercial feed for horses (humidity 12%, protein 15 -16.5%, oils and lipids 1.5 ashes 2.6%; sodium 75 mg/kg; Equi oc)1, in accordance with the NRC recommendations for energy. All the donkeys included in this study had never been vaccinated and had not received antiparasitic drug treatments for at least one year. The inclusion criteria were: 1) nonathletes and nonworking donkeys; 2) breeding animals; 3) no administration of nonsteroidal anti-in flammatory drugs or corticosteroids for at least 20 days immediately prior to gastroscopy. The day prior to gastroscopy a clinical examination and routine blood work was performed on all the donkeys enrolled. The animals were then housed in 4 94 m boxes 15 h before gastroscopy. The examination was performed under sedation after 15 h of fasting with the examination room.Gastroscopy was performed as described by Bain et al. (2004), using a portable processor Gastropack 4and a 300 cm long scope (60130PKS)4. The long gastroscope was passed into the stomach, which was insuf flated with air through an air- flow system attached to the biopsy channel of the endoscope until the internal stomach folds appeared flattened. Feed material adherent to the nonglandular mucosa was flushed away with sterile water in order to visualise the entire nonglandular portion of the stomach, including the greater curvature, the lesser curvature, and the dorsal fundus. The images were recorded on a digital media for subsequent revaluation and storage. The lesions were graded and described in accordance with the European College of Equine Internal Medicine Consensus Statement guidelines (Sykes et al. 2015). Equine squamous gastric disease (ESGD) lesions were scored using the scale proposed by the EGUS Council (1999), while equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) was not scored, but described as the presence or absence, anatomical location, distribution and appearance of lesions. The occurrence of Gasterophilus larvae in the stomach and proximal duodenum was also determined during the gastroscopic examination. A few (3 -5) larvae were collected via the biopsy channel of the endoscope using a biopsy pincer from each infested animal, placed in plastic vials containing saline solution (NaCl 0.9%), examined under astereomicroscope, and identi ed by their morphological features to species level according to Zumpt (1965).Statistical analysis Total prevalence values of EGUS, ESGD and EGGD, singlescores (0 -4), groups of scores ranging from 1 to 2 -4, and Gasterophilus infestations were determined. In addition, the corresponding 95% con dence intervals (CIs) were calculated with Jeffrey 's method (http://epitools.ausvet. com.au/content.php?page=CIProportion). Prevalence values and 95% CIs of EGUS according to anatomical location (ESGD and EGGD), sex, age ( 3 years and >3 years), and breed (Amiatina and crossbreed) as well as distribution of scores of ESGD according to sex, age and breed were also calculated. Fisher 's exact test was used to compare differences between groups. Statistical analysis was performed with commercial software (Prism 7) 5. Differences were considered signi cant and highly signi cant when P values were <0.05 and <0.01, respectively. Results The donkeys enrolled in this study included 16 femaledonkeys (jennies) and 23 male donkeys (jacks), aged 1 - 18 years (median age =3 years). A 15-h feed withdrawal time was adequate to visualise 95% of the stomach (Forset al. 2001). The gastroscopy was performed in all the donkeys enrolled (39/39, 100%). The anatomy was similar toobservations described by others (Fors et al. 2001; Jerbi et al. 2014). Lesions attributable to EGUS were not present in 19/39 while donkeys had lesions consistent with EGUS. Of the 20 donkeys with lesions consistent with EGUS, 19/39 (48.7% [33-64.4%]) animals had ESGD, 39 (2.6% -7.5%]) (2.6% [0 -7.5%]) donkeys, respectively. On the basis of the scores proposed by Andrews et al. (1999) and Sykes et al. (2015), grade 1 is characterised by an intact squamous gastric mucosa with the presence of hyperaemia and/or hyperparakeratosis, while grades 2 -4 are characterised by the presence of squamous gastric ulcers. Thus, the total prevalence of donkeys with gastric lesions obtained in this study (51.3% [35.6 -67%]) included 12.8% (5.1 - 25.8%) of donkeys hyperkeratosis and/or hyperaemia (score 1) and 38.4% (24.5 -54.1%) showing in the nonglandular mucosa (scores 2-4). The EGGD lesion consisted of a mild depression in the ventral glandular fundus and was associated with ESGD lesions scoring 2. ESGD was considered primary in all the positive (19/19, 100%) donkeys enrolled with alterations located around the cardia and along the lesser curvature. Tables 1 and 2 summarise the results for the prevalence of EGUS according to anatomical location of lesions (ESGD orESGD/EGGD), sex, age ( 3 years or >3 years) and breed (Amiatina or crossbreed), as well as distribution of scores for ESGD according to sex, age, and breed, respectively. All the animals (39/39, 100%) showed the occurrence of Gasterophilus larvae attached in groups near the margo plicatus curvature, irrespective of the presence or absence of EGUS. No Gasterophilus larvae were found in the proximal duodenum. In agreement with Al-Mokaddem et al. (2014), after larvae left small erosions \u00a92017 EVJ EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8at their attachment sites. All larvae collected during the studyperiod identi ed as third-stage of Gasterophilus intestinalis . Statistical analysis showed no signi cant differences in the prevalence of EGUS with respect to sex (P =0.75) age (P>0.999) and breed (P =0.37), while the difference between the number of donkeys affected by ESGD and those affected by ESGD/EGGD was highly signi cant (P <0.0001). Similarly, the difference between the prevalence of donkeys affected by grade 1 lesions (hyperaemia and/or hyperparakeratosis) and the prevalence of donkeys affected by grade 2 -4 lesions (ulcers) was statistically signi 38.5% [23.2 -53.7%], P =0.0183). Discussion The aim of the present study was to present the prevalence,and anatomical distribution of EGUS in a cohort of live adultdonkeys. To the best of the authors 'knowledge, this is the rst report to consider the gastroscopic evaluation of EGUS in live donkeys. The gastroscopic examination was performed in all the donkeys enrolled in the present study, no damage to the oesophageal or gastric mucosa due to the passage of the endoscope was detected and the stomach was reached easily. The prevalence of gastric lesions consistent with EGUS obtained in this study was 51.3% (35.6 -67%) and 38.5% (23.2 - 53.7%) of the animals had ulcers (grade 2/4 -4/4). In addition, the squamous portion of the stomach was predominantlyaffected. Morrow and colleagues (2011) reported aprevalence of 42.1% (39.6 -44.7%) of gastric ulcers, alone or in combination with other disorders, in a retrospective post-mortem study; they did not describe the localisation of thelesions (ESGD or EGGD) or the lesions 'score. Burden and colleagues (2009) found a prevalence of 41% in donkeys thathad been subjected to euthanasia or were dead and didnot describe the localisation of the lesions or the scoring. Al-Mokaddem and colleagues (2014) found a lower prevalence(20%) of gastric lesions (erosions/ulcerations) in 35 maturedraught donkeys that had been subjected to euthanasia. Ina study conducted in Spain on 10 dead donkeys, Morales Brice ~noet al. (2015) reported a 90% prevalence of gastric ulcers, and performed a lesion scoring (0/4 -4/4) similar to ours, as proposed by others (Andrews et al. 1999). Our results, obtained in apparently healthy donkeys examined alive, showed a similar prevalence of EGUS to the value reported by Morrow et al. (2011), considering the 95% CIs, higher than values reported by other authors (Burden et al. 2009; Al- Mokaddem et al. 2014), and lower than the ndings of Morales Brice ~no and colleagues (2015) obtained in donkeys that were dead or had been subjected to euthanasia. None of the donkeys enrolled in above mentioned studies were working animals, instead they had a sedentary life style, like the donkeys included in this survey. However, the donkeys enrolled in previous studies (Burden et al. 2009; Morrow et al. 2011) were elderly (mean age: 30.5 and 30.6 years, respectively), while in the present study we enrolled younger animals (mean age: 5 years). In the survey carried out by Morrow and colleagues (2011), 92.6% of the donkeys were humanely destroyed, 4.8% were found dead and 2.6% died under treatment for different diseases. Burden and colleagues (2009) enrolled donkeys affected by different pathologies, which were dead or were subjected to euthanasia because of problems in one of the main body systems. In the present paper, 48.7% (33 -64.4%) of the animals showed ESGD of grade 0/4, while 48.7% (33 -64.4%) had lesions graded 1/4 -3/4, with a very low prevalence (2.6%, 0.0 - 7.5%) of grade 4/4. In the report by Morales Brice ~no and colleagues (2015), the evaluation of gastric lesions in dead donkeys revealed an ESGD with the highest prevalence of grade 2/4. These differences could be related to the inclusion of alive vs. dead donkeys and to the higher number of animals evaluated in the present study compared to theprevious one (39 vs. 10). No differences related to sex, age or breed were found in this study. This is in line with reports performed both in donkeys(Burden et al. 2009) and horses (Vatistas et al. 1999; Rabuffo et al. 2002; Bezdukova et al. 2005; Bell et al. 2007; Lester et al. 2008; Hepburn 2014), but in contrast with other authors (Sandin et al. 2000). None of our donkeys had clinical signs attributable to EGUS or other diseases, in accordance with Morales Brice ~no and colleagues (2014), who enrolled asymptomatic donkeys that died due to nondigestive causes. The majority of donkeys enrolled by Burden et al. (2009) were subjected to euthanasia or died due to a problem in one of the main body organ systems. By contrast, Morrow et al. (2011) reported that only 2.6% of the donkeys enrolled were subjected to euthanasia under treatment of a nonspeci ed disease. Finally, Al-Mokadden and colleagues (2014)included donkeys subjected to euthanasia for diseases notrelated to EGUS, which were predominantly long bonefractures. The detection of third-stage G. intestinalis larvae was not unexpected since these can be retrieved throughout theyear and G. instestinalis has been reported as the most common Gasterophilus species in Italy (Otranto et al. 2005). G. intestinalis larvae were found to be attached along the margo plicatus in all our donkeys. These ndings are in agreement with other authors who detected a 100%infestation rate in Egypt (Al-Mokaddem et al. 2014). However, lower prevalence values of 30% and 0.4% have also beenTABLE 1: Prevalence values and 95% con dence intervals (95% CI) of equine gastric ulceration syndrome in donkeys examinedalive by gastroscopic examination, according to anatomicallocation of the lesions, sex, age, with Equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD);highly signi cant difference by Fisher 's exact test (P <0.0001); CI, con dence interval. \u00a92017 EVJ LtdEQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8 208reported in Spain (Morales Brice ~noet al. 2015) and in the UK (Morrow et al. 2011), respectively. Differences in prevalence rates of G. intestinalis may be due to environmental and climatic conditions in fluencing the spread of parasites. Some geographical areas may therefore be more favourable than others for the transmission of equine gastric myasis. It is also possible that lower prevalences were associated with the use of drugs that are effective against gastric stages of G. intestinalis . Unfortunately, other researchers did not provide information in this regard in their studies (Morrow et al. 2011; Morales Brice ~noet al. 2015). The role of parasites in the pathogenesis of gastric lesions is unclear. Previous reports have suggested that Gasterophilus spp. can cause gastric and intestinal ulceration (Sandin et al. 2000; Sequeira et al. 2001). Since larvae were found both in donkeys with and without EGUS, the authors cannot rule out whether infestationbyG. intestinalis could be a risk factor for EGUS in this host species. The starch/grain intake has been associated with a higher risk of EGUS, both in horses (Vatistas et al. 1999; Frank et al. 2005; Luthersson et al. 2009) and donkeys (Burden et al. 2009). All the donkeys included in the present study were fedon carbohydrates in the same manner; therefore, this riskfactor could not be evaluated. Conclusions Equine gastric ulcer syndrome has been described in horsesand donkeys. In this study, we report EGUS in a population ofdonkeys in Italy. Our results highlight that EGUS had highprevalence in the examined donkey population althoughthere were no clinical signs and that the squamous portion ofthe stomach was much more frequently affected than theglandular region. This suggests that EGUS may be morecommon in donkeys than was previously thought, but it isroutinely overlooked. Further studies are needed toinvestigate the aetiology, pathogenesis, clinical signi cance and risk factors for this condition in donkeys.Authors 'declaration of interests No con flicts of interest have been declared.

Radiography has been reported to underestimate theincidence and severity of lesions that may subsequently beidenti ed on arthroscopic examination (Steinheimer et al. 1995). PICO question In horses with osteochondrosis of the femoral trochlear ridges,how does radiography compare with a combination ofradiography and ultrasound for the sensitivity and speci city of lesion diagnosis? Patient: horses Comparison intervention: in diagnosis of lesion occurrenceSearch strategy (Equine or horse) AND (sti fle or femoral trochlear ridge) AND (OCD or osteochondrosis or developmental orthopaedicdisease) AND (radiology or ultrasound or imaging). Performedon 28 April 2016 ( Table 1 ). Inclusion criteria : studies where ndings have been veri ed using post-mortem or arthroscopic evaluation to con rm imaging ndings directly relevant to the PICO question. Exclusion criteria : papers older than 25 years, papers that did not relate to the PICO question (e.g. prevalence ofosteochondrosis or performance outcomes); secondarysources of information (book chapters/review articles). Summary of the evidence All three included publications (Steinheimer et al. 1995; Bourzac et al. 2009; Beccati et al. 2013; Tables 2 -4) were classi ed level 4 on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine (OCEBM Levels of Evidence Working Group). The studies included are low on the hierarchy of evidence; however, the cases included are relevant to clinical cases of osteochondrosis of the sti fle that may be encountered in a referral, mixed-breed population. Further studies in rst opinion/sales practice are required in order to be able to relate the ndings to other populations of animals.

Furtherprospective studies of a larger number of horses are requiredto answer the question more clearly. The clinical implicationsof this review are that it is likely to change the practice ofthose who do not routinely include ultrasound evaluation ofthe femoropatellar joint when osteochondrosis of thetrochlear ridges is suspected. This evidence will reinforce my current clinical practice to always include an ultrasound examination of the sti fle when osteochondrosis is suspected.

Mora Pereira, E. Groover*, A. Wooldridge and F. Caldwell J. T. Vaughan Large Animal Teaching Hospital, Auburn University, Alabama, USA. article is the second in a review series about the use ofglucocorticoids to treat medical and musculoskeletalconditions in horses. This segment in the series summarisesreported dosages, methods of administration and the ef cacy of glucocorticoids for various systemic diseases in equids. The most common use of systemic glucocorticoids reported in the literature for management and treatment of alterations of the respiratory, integumentary, immune and neurological systems are included. Introduction Exogenous glucocorticoids have been used to treat a diversevariety of in flammatory conditions in horses due to their potent and rapid effects. The mechanisms of action and themost common glucocorticoids that are used in equinemedicine are discussed in a previous review article in thisseries. The objective of this segment in the series is tosummarise reported dosages, methods of administration andthe ef cacy of glucocorticoids for common systemic inflammatory diseases. The use of glucocorticoids for respiratory, integumentary, immune-mediated andneurological disorders are reviewed. Respiratory system Glucocorticoids for recurrent airway obstruction and inflammatory airway disease Recurrent airway obstruction (RAO), also referred to as heavesand equine asthma, is a chronic in flammatory condition of the lower airways, associated with increased mucus production, contraction of the bronchial smooth muscle and thickening of the airway wall. These changes in the lower airways result in overt increased respiratory effort at rest. The triggering factor for the development of RAO is exposure to organic dust present in the horse 's environment (Cornelisse et al. 2004). This condition most commonly affects mature horses, and the signs can be reversed with medical therapy and environmental management (Cou \u20acetil et al. 2007). In flammatory airway disease (IAD) can affect horses of any age, with subtle clinical signs at rest; however, horses often present with exercise intolerance, poor performance and cough (Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007). The presence of high eosinophil or mast cell concentrations in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) suggests that aeroallergens might contribute to the development of this condition (Hoffman et al. 1998; Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007). Recurrent airway obstruction and in flammatory airway disease are the most common airway conditions in horses inwhich glucocorticoids are used for therapy (Ivester and Cou \u20acetil 2014). The use of glucocorticoids for their anti- inflammatory effects, together with bronchodilators and environmental changes, have shown to improve chronic lower airway in flammation in many cases (L Ivester and Cou In some horses, respiratory conditions such as RAO and IAD can be managed successfully with strict environmental changes in order to minimise allergen exposure, but in cases with signi cant clinical signs, pharmacological therapy is often necessary to accelerate recovery (Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007; Ivester and Cou \u20acetil flammation contributes to the pathogenesis of RAO and IAD, it should be considered themain target of therapeutic intervention (L /C19eguillette 2003; Laan et al. 2006). Medications containing glucocorticoids are commonly delivered by either the parenteral, oral or inhalation routes in horses, and the severity of the condition often determines the route of treatment; horses with severe in flammation may require parenteral administration to achieve adequate results. The severity and possible cause of airway obstruction and in flammation can be primarily assessed by analysis of BALF, but cytological analysis of fluid collected by transtracheal wash (TTW) is also useful. Microscopic evaluation of these samples will show the type and amountof in flammatory cells involved in the process and the presence of microorganisms (L /C19eguillette 2003; Hewson and Arroyo 2015). Findings from these diagnostic tests in combination with the clinical examination can determine the treatment of choice. Ideally, before glucocorticoid therapy is utilised, the clinician should determine through physical examination ndings, cytological examination of BALF or TTW fluid, possibly culture of a TTW sample, and complete blood count, whether or not an infectious respiratory problem is present (Cou \u20acetil et al. 2007; Hewson and Arroyo 2015). Glucocorticoids may not be recommended if bacterial infection is present or, at minimum, concurrent antimicrobial therapy may be needed. Parenteral and enteral use Enteral or parenteral routes for glucocorticoid administrationare usually more economical than inhalation therapy, and nospecialised equipment is required. Parenteral use ofglucocorticoids, especially i.v., is recommended for acuteand severe airway obstruction in cases of RAO until theclinical signs are controlled enough to be able to change toenteral or inhaled therapy (L /C19eguillette 2003). Systemic administration of dexamethasone rapidly improved clinicalsigns, lung function and percentage of 10.1111/eve.12624within 24 h in horses with RAO (Robinson et al. 2002). Intravenous use of dexamethasone caused signi cant improvement in lung function of RAO affected horses within2 h with a peak effect at 4 -6 h (Cornelisse et al. 2004). In RAO challenged horses, the use of dexamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. once daily, when compared to i.m. use of dexamethasone-21-isonicotinate and prednisone orally, was the only treatment that improved the lung function and decreased the percentage of neutrophils in the BALF (Robinson et al. 2002). Dexamethasone is one of the most common glucocorticoids used for treatment of RAO (Cornelisse et al. 2004; Cou \u20acetilet al. 2006). As was mentioned previously, the parenteral route is more ef cacious for critical cases, but once the condition is stable, the enteral route is widely used due to the ease of administration (Robinson et al. 2002; Grady et al. 2010). The injectable formulation approved for i.v. and i.m. use, is commonly prescribed by veterinarians for extralabel use orally, as it is inexpensive and readily available when compared to the dexamethasone powder labelled for oral use (Grady et al. 2010). In a pharmacokinetic study, the injectable form of dexamethasone showed to have variable bioavailability, ranging from 28 to 88% (Grady et al. 2010), being greater in fasted animals (Cornelisse et al. 2004). It should be acknowledged that, according to the Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clari cation Act (1994), due to the fact that oral formulations of dexamethasone are available in the market, the extralabel use of the drug is not allowed, unless ithas been established by a veterinarian that there is no local availability of the oral form. Based on ef cacy for treatment of human asthma, oral prednisone has been used in the past to treat recurrent airway obstruction in horses; however, Peroni et al. (2002) demonstrated that prednisone is poorly absorbed, and its active metabolite prednisolone is rarely produced, with almost no plasma levels detected, therefore its therapeutic use is not recommended in horses. Since prednisone was not detected in serum after oral administration, it is thought that the lack of effectiveness is due to poor intestinal absorption; however, failure of the liver to convert prednisone to prednisolone, and the low af nity of prednisone to plasma proteins such as transcortin warrant further research (Alvinerie et al. 1988; Peroni et al. 2002). Prednisolone by contrast can be used to treat in flammatory conditions involving the lower airways, and is commonly used to manage RAO in horses. Even though prednisolone is less potent than dexamethasone, it has been shown to improve pulmonary function of affected horses at a 2 mg/kg bwt dose orally once daily after 7 days. However, dexamethasone given orally at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg bwt showed a greater improvement in the pulmonary function after 3 and 7 days of treatment, when compared to prednisolone, even under continuous antigen exposure (Leclere et al. 2010). In the authors 'clinical experience, and based on scienti c data previously described, for signi cant exacerbations of in flammatory lower respiratory conditions such as RAO, a positive response has been observed when using dexamethasone i.m. at an initial dose of 0.1 mg/kg bwt once daily for 3 -7 days and tapering for a total of 3 -4 weeks of therapy ( Table 1 ) in conjunction with environmental management. Once the acute phase of the condition haspassed (beginning at Week 2 -3), treatment is continued with orally administered dexamethasone. A shorter course ofdexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg bwt i.m. once daily for 7 days) with no taper may also be effective if comprehensive environmental changes are instituted concurrently (Ivester and Cou \u20acetil 2014). Similar to RAO, successful response to treatment of horses with IAD is better when a combination of both environmental management and medical therapy is utilised. Both systemic and aerosolised glucocorticoids can be used to control the neutrophilic airway in flammation in cases of IAD (Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007). Positive results have been observed with the use of oral prednisolone at a starting dose of 2.2 mg/kg bwt orally once daily for 7 -10 days, then tapering to 1.0 mg/kg bwt once daily for 7 -10 days, and then 1.0 mg/kg bwt every other day for 7 -10 days; and in general, 2 -4 weeks of glucocorticoid therapy is often prescribed for horses with IAD (Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007; Ainsworth and Cheetham 2010a). In racehorses, oral dexamethasone used at a dosage of 10 mg daily every other day for a total of ve doses has showed a positive effect (Berthold and Robinson 2009). Inhalation therapy Inhalation therapy for the treatment of lower respiratory tractinflammation in horses such as RAO and IAD is becoming a more common method of treatment. Inhaled glucocorticoidsresult in less adverse effects for the horse because thetherapeutic dose is usually lower, and the drug acts locallywithin the respiratory system (Lavoie 2001; Rush 2002, 2004).The response to treatment is usually positive within a shortperiod, with signi cant changes observed after 72 h after initiation of therapy with fluticasone propionate; if combined with bronchodilators, the response can be even faster(Lavoie 2001; L Robinson et Cou \u20acetil 2014). Treatment of RAO and IAD with inhaled glucocorticoids is usually accompanied by the use ofbronchodilators such as albuterol, salmeterol, fenoterol orpirbuterol. To administer an aerosolised medication, a special delivery device should be used. The purpose of these devicesis to optimise and maximise drug delivery into the lung (Rush2002; Robinson et al. 2009). Some devices consist of a nose piece that adapts over a nostril ( Fig 1a ), while others are a face mask that ts the horse 's muzzle ( Fig 1b ). The ef cacy of inhaled drugs depends on the dose and distribution of aerosol deposited locally as well as the potency of the drug. Distribution of an aerosol is determined by particle size, and shape, as well as by patency of the airways and breathing pattern (Rush 2002). AerosolisedTABLE 1: Recommended dosing schedule with parenteral use of dexamethasone for treatment of recurrent airway obstruction.Duration and dosages may vary depending on the patient 's progression Dose (mg/kg bwt) Route Frequency Duration 0.1* ,i.m.

This diameter will vary depending on the type ofinhalation delivery system and the formulation of the drug(Lavoie 2001). Both Equine Haler and AeroHippus consist ofhand-held chambers connected to a nose mask that isplaced over one nostril and should be held on the nostril forthree respiratory cycles to ensure complete inhalation of thedose (Bertin et al. 2011). In contrast, Flexineb equine nebuliser, is a mask type inhaler designed to be used withmetered-dose inhalers or wet nebulisation.Beclomethasone dipropionate is one of the most widely used inhaled glucocorticoids for treatment of human asthma. In horses, beclomethasone use results in marked improvement in respiratory function in horses affected with RAO by decreasing transpulmonary pressure and total pulmonary resistance, and increasing the partial pressure of oxygen (Ammann et al. 1998). In a study by Cou \u20acetilet al. (2006), RAO challenged horses weighing between 341 and 521 kg, were treated with either low dose beclomethasone dipropionate (500 lg every 12 h) for 10 days or one single injection of dexamethasone isonicotinate (0.06 mg/kg bwt i.m.). After 10 days, the horses treated with the inhaler showed signi cant improvement in respiratory function, when compared with the horses treated with dexamethasone i.m. No changes in BALF cytology or expression of proin flammatory transcription factors nuclear factor- jB and activator protein-1 were identi ed in the horses treated with either dexamethasone i.m. or inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (Cou \u20acetilet al. 2006). Even though pulmonary function testing responses and clinical signs of airway obstruction improve by administration of beclomethasone, the magnitude of response is less marked than the response of i.m. use of dexamethasone when given by daily injections, comparing at Days 7, 10, 14 and 21 of treatment (Rush et al. 1998). Studies have shown that in horses exposed to a dusty environment, after discontinuation of inhalation therapy with beclomethasone, clinical signs of RAO return within 7 days ifthe environmental allergen exposure is not minimised (Rush et al. 1998; Rush 2004). Unlike human patients, horses are more sensitive to the adrenosuppressive effects of aerosolised beclomethasone. Low dose (500 lg) beclomethasone administration caused similar improvement in pulmonary function, compared with high-dose beclomethasone (1000 and 1500 lg), and caused less suppression of endogenous cortisol production (Rush et al. 2000). Adrenal suppression, determined by a decrease in circulating cortisol, is a sensitive indicator of systemic absorption of aerosolised glucocorticoids, and even though the adverse effects of systemic glucocorticoids have not been reported with the use of beclomethasone or fluticasone, these drugs should be used judiciously at the lowest effective dose (Rush et al. 2000; D/C19azet al. 2014; Munoz et al. 2015). Fluticasone propionate is the most potent, most lipophilic, and has the least potential for adrenal suppression of theavailable aerosolised glucocorticoids (Dauvillier et al. dosages for propionate range between 2-4lg/kg bwt every 12 h (Ainsworth and Cheetham 2010b), which is about 2000 lg for horses weighing between 410 and 535 kg (Lavoie 2001; Dauvillier et al. 2011). Dosages of fluticasone propionate can vary from 2000 lg up to 6000 lg every 12 h, depending on the severity of the condition and the horse 's bodyweight (Wilson and Robinson 2015). Fluticasone has shown to be effective in prevention and maintenance of RAO; however, for the treatment of acute exacerbations, systemic use of dexamethasone provides a faster and more signi cant positive effect in pulmonary function (Robinson et al. 2009). Aerosolised glucocorticoids have been shown to induce a dose dependent suppression of endogenous cortisol in horses suggesting that systemic effects may occur (Rush et al. 1999). Aged horses with a bodyweight between 419 and 550 kg treated with 2000 lg every 12 h of fluticasone for 6 months a) b) Fig 1: Delivery devices for the administration of inhaled glucocorticoids. a) AeroHippusTMhand-held device, and b) FlexinebTMnebulizer. \u00a92016 EVJ VETERINARY EDUCATION / 8showed a decrease in cortisol concentration; however,concentrations returned to a level similar to baseline valueswhen the dose was given once a day (D /C19azet al. 2014). This suggests that long-term therapeutic use of aerosolised fluticasone suppresses endogenous cortisol through its action over the hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal axis. For long-term treatment, the lowest effective dose of fluticasone should be utilised and it should be combined with environmental management (D /C19azet al. 2014). Systemic absorption of inhaled glucocorticoids occurs via the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract, and is re flected by the observed adrenal suppression in different studies (Rush et al. 1999, 2000; D /C19azet al. 2014). It has been documented that about 23% of the beclomethasone administered via the metered-dose inhaler is deposited and metabolised in the lower respiratory tract; meaning that the remaining may be absorbed from the lungs to systemic circulation, or swallowed from the nasopharynx (Rush et al. 1999). This brings some concerns about possible systemic side effects of circulating glucocorticoids after inhalation therapy; however, no studies have been performed in horses to determine the likelihood of adverse effects after the use of inhaled glucocorticoids. In man, fluticasone propionate was observed to have poor oral absorption and low systemic bioavailability after intranasal administration, concluding that systemic side effects were unlikely (Daley-Yates and Baker 2001); however, this conclusion must be taken with caution in horses, since they have shown to be more sensitive to adrenal suppressionthan humans (Barnes 1995). It is important to mention that hygiene must be considered when administering inhaled glucocorticoids, since contaminated delivering devices could be a source for pathogens in the respiratory tract (Duvivier et al. 1997; Lavoie 2001). In man, there is a risk of oropharyngeal candidiasis with the long-term use of inhalation therapy, especially in elderly or immunosuppressed human patients (Barnes 1995; Battaglia et al. 2015); however, this is not reported in horses. To analyse better the possible side effects due to inhalation therapy with glucocorticoids in horses, studies comparing side effects in different body systems between inhalation and systemic administration need to be performed in horses. Extrapolating from human studies, complications in at-risk-populations of respiratory infections, ocular damage, or bony changes could arise; however, when compared with the use of systemic glucocorticoids, these side effects were less pronounced (Battaglia et al. 2015). Inhalation therapy could be adequate for many horses with IAD, where, unlike horses with RAO, a rapid effect is not needed to control severe bronchospasm in an acute crisis. Fluticasone propionate alone can be used to manage cases of IAD, and a suggested dose for an average sized mature horse is to start at a dose of 2000 lg every 12 h for one week, then 2000 lg once daily for one week, then 1500 lg once daily for another week, followed by 1500 lg every other day until discontinuation; and this treatment is reported up to 3 months in duration (Mazan 2009). In general, the same drugs used for the treatment of RAO are bene cial in cases of IAD; however, a positive effect is observed with lower dosages for shorter treatment durations in horses with IAD. Two to 4 weeks of glucocorticoid therapy is often prescribed(Rush 2002; Cou \u20acetilet al. 2007). There is suf cient scienti c evidence for the use of glucocorticoids in the management of both RAO and IAD inhorses, either by the enteral, parenteral or inhalation route. Dosages have been established based on clinical studies; however, the practitioner will encounter a diverse response depending on the case and management practices, leading to the use of different dosing regimens. Glucocorticoids for the treatment of interstitial pneumonia Interstitial pneumonia is a cause of acute or chronic lowerrespiratory tract disease in horses. Even though infectiousorganisms or toxins have been implicated in the pathogenesisof the disease, it is often referred to as idiopathic due to thedifculty in identifying a causative agent (Wilkins et al. 2015). The in flammation in the lung parenchyma will cause structural changes in the lung, reducing the number of functionalalveoli and therefore affecting ventilation. This reduction inlung compliance is associated with the loss of distensiblealveoli, the presence of pulmonary oedema and brosis (Wilkins and Lascola 2015). Glucocorticoids are thought to work in decreasing the in flammation that precedes the development of brous tissue and early and aggressive use may lead to a better long-term outcome for cases of interstitial pneumonia (Spelta et al. 2013). The course of therapy is usually prolonged, ranging from 6 to 12 weeks, and is often accompanied by treatment with antimicrobial medications. Treatments described include dexamethasone i.m. or i.v. at 0.02 -0.04 mg/kg bwt every 12 -24 h, and prednisolone per os at 1 mg/kg bwt every 12 -24 h (Wilkins and Lascola 2015). Equine multinodular pulmonary brosis is a chronic and progressive type of interstitial pneumonia associated with the presence of equine herpesvirus type 5 (Spelta et al. 2013; Kessell et al. 2014). Since an infectious organism is often the cause of multinodular pulmonary brosis in horses, glucocorticoid therapy is sometimes avoided due to its immunosuppressive effects; however, inhibition of the inflammatory response is a key factor to avoid irreversible damage to the lung (Niedermaier et al. 2010). Long-term therapy with systemic glucocorticoids in cases of interstitial pneumonia may put the animals at risk for developing gastric ulceration, or delay in healing of already existing ulcers, therefore gastric acid suppression may be indicated for the duration of the treatment (Boothe and Mealey 2012). Gastrointestinal system Inflammatory bowel disease Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by inflammatory cell in ltration of the bowel wall ( Fig 2 ). Depending on the in flammatory cells involved, they are classi ed occurs in the mucosa and submucosa, and the cause may be associatedwith parasitic, infectious or neoplastic processes (Schumacher2009). Horses will typically present with progressive weight lossand intermittent abdominal discomfort. Diarrhoea may ormay not be present, and hypoproteinaemia is common dueto intestinal protein loss. The clinical signs are similar regardlessof the type of cellular in ltrate (Davis 2009; Schumacher 2009). De nitive diagnosis is based on results of histological examination of an intestinal biopsy specimen (Schumacher et al. 2000). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd216 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8Management of mature horses with in flammatory bowel disease is typically unsuccessful long term (Barr 2006). Glucocorticoids are the drugs used most commonly to treat IBD because they reduce intestinal in flammation (Schumacher 2009). Since a prolonged and high dose course of therapy is often required, horses must be monitored for any adverse clinical signs, such as immunosuppression, gastric ulceration or increased susceptibility to infections (Barr 2006). Anecdotally, long-term use of systemic glucocorticoids hasbeen related to the development of laminitis; however, there is no scienti c evidence to support this. No relationship was found in a previous retrospective study of horses on long-term therapy with prednisolone and the occurrence of laminitis (Jordan et al. 2017). Even though prognosis for horses with IBD is poor, there are case reports describing that long-term survival and parenteral use of dexamethasone appeared to produce better results (Duryea et al. 1997; McCue et al. 2003; Carmalt 2004). There are no large studies assessing the ef cacy of glucocorticoids in the treatment of IBD using differentprotocols for each speci c type of cellular in ltrate, therefore the presented dosing regimens are based on case reports,with a degree of variability among them. A prolonged, tapering course of glucocorticoids is recommended, and parenteral administration is initiallynecessary because absorption of orally administeredmedication may be poor (Barr 2006; Schumacher 2009). Asuggested initial dose for dexamethasone is 0.05 -0.1 mg/kg bwt i.m. for 2 -4 weeks (Kemper et al. 2000; Schumacher 2009); however, most reported cases of IBD in horses have been fatal despite aggressive treatment with glucocorticoids (Schumacher 2009). For some cases, high doses of dexamethasone, up to 0.2 mg/kg bwt once daily, are recommended (Davis 2009). The dosing schedule should be adjusted to meet each horse 's needs, tapering or increasing it based on response to the treatment; as well as decreasing or even discontinuing the therapy if there is concern of adverse effects such as laminitis or secondary infections (Kalck 2009). A dosing schedule is described in Table 2 . The suggested protocol can be adjusted based on clinical response; it is important to evaluate the clinical condition prior to decreasing the medication. Since the protocol forthese cases is long and with high doses, owners should be aware of possible adverse effects such as delayed wound healing, gastric ulceration or immunosuppression, as well as the likelihood of relapses, in which case the dosage shouldbe reviewed. In horses in which clinical improvement is noted, maintenance with low doses of dexamethasone from 0.02 to 0.05 mg/kg bwt orally once daily can be attempted;however, signs may re-appear (McCue et al. 2003; Barr 2006). Prednisolone administered orally from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg bwt once daily was proven to be ineffective in the treatment of equine granulomatous enteritis (Woods et al. 1993). Even though there is a lack of literature reporting success after treatment of IBD with orally administered prednisolone, the reported dose of this drug ranges from 0.2 to 4.4 mg/kg bwt orally every 12 -24 h (Barr 2006; Kaikkonen et al. 2014). Clinical cases of horses with GE and LPE have been reported to respond favourably to treatment with dexamethasone (Duryea et al. 1997; Kemper et al. 2000). However, in most of the published reports of horses with LPE, affected animals were subjected to euthanasia because of poor condition or lack of response to treatment (Kemper et al. 2000; Schumacher 2009). In a case report of LPE in an Arabian gelding, dexamethasone was administered daily starting at 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v.; the dose was tapered by 10 mg weekly until a dose of 10 mg was reached. During the treatment, clinical signs improved for short periods and then returned, so the horse was ultimately subjected to euthanasia (Barr 2006). Another report of treatment of GE was reported to respond to long-term treatment with dexamethasone administered i.m., starting at 40 mg and tapering over a 16- week period. Five months after discontinuation of therapy, the horse was brighter and back to normal activity (Duryea et al. 1997). There are several reports of horses with MEED being successfully treated with glucocorticoids. In one report, there was a positive response to treatment, initially with dexamethasone administered i.v., followed by subsequent oral administration; the horse was reported to remain clinically normal after discontinuation of treatment (Carmalt 2004). Another horse was treated with low doses of dexamethasone starting at 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. once daily and tapered to 0.018 mg/kg bwt once daily until treatment wasstopped at Day 52. The horse was followed for 17 months and dexamethasone was adjusted intermittently based on appearance of eosinophilia (Carmalt 2004). In a case report of MEED in which the horse showed clinical improvement for at least 18 months, it was determined that the minimum effective dose of dexamethasone was 0.03 mg/kg bwt i.v. every 24 h for 14 days, after which it was gradually decreased (McCue et al. 2003). Since the type of cellular in ltrate varies among cases of IBD, it may be inappropriate to compare the response to treatment among them (Kalck 2009). It is therefore important to mention that even though some dosing regimens areTABLE 2: Treatment for the management of in flammatory bowel disease in horses using dexamethasone Dose (mg/kg bwt) Route Frequency Duration 0.1 i.m. Once daily 14 -21 days 0.075 i.m. Once daily 21 days0.05 i.m. Once daily 21 days0.025 i.m. or per os Once daily 21 days 0.025 i.m. or per os Every other day Maintenance Adjusted from Kalck (2009). Fig 2: Thickening of the small intestinal wall (arrow) in a case of lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd217 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8provided, due to the complexity of this condition, and thehigh variability in responses, dosing frequency and durationoften have to adjusted. Integumentary system Insect bite hypersensitivity Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is the most common causeof pruritus in horses, and reaction to bites by variousCulicoides spp. gnats is the most well documented cause (Petersen 2009; Stepnik et al. 2012). IgE-mediated, type I hypersensitivity with release of histamine and otherinflammatory mediators are often involved in IBH. However, in some horses, cell-mediated, type IV hypersensitivity mayalso contribute to the pathogenesis (Jonsdottir et al. 2015). Common signs include pruritus and papules, usually observed along the dorsum, mane, rump and tail base. Histologically, the lesions are characterised by mixed perivascular to diffuse cellular in ltrates consisting of mononuclear cells and eosinophils in acute lesions (Schaffartzik et al. 2012). Intradermal testing (IDT) has been used in horses as a diagnostic tool for conditions such as IBH, urticaria, or RAO. It is known that horses with clinical signs of Culicoides hypersensitivity have stronger IDT reactions than healthy horses do, which is an advantage when immunotherapy is considered to prevent flare-ups of the condition (Jose-Cunilleras et al. 2001). Decreasing exposure to insects is the most important management practice; however, severely affected horses,particularly those with marked pruritus, may need anti-inflammatory treatment with systemic glucocorticoids (Rees 2005; al. 2012). Prednisolone 1 mg/kg bwt orally every 24 h or dexamethasone at 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg bwt orally once daily can be used until pruritusand self-trauma are controlled, at which point the dose istapered to the lowest dosage that controls pruritus (Pilsworthand Knottenbelt 2004; Petersen 2009). In severe cases,prednisolone can be administered at 2 mg/kg bwt orallyonce daily for 3 -10 days until the pruritus is controlled, followed by tapering to 0.5 mg/kg bwt every other day(Marsella 2013). Glucocorticoid therapy should bediscontinued as soon as the biting season has passed(Pilsworth and Knottenbelt 2004). It is important to mentionthat despite medical therapy or environmental management,equine insect hypersensitivity is a seasonal and recurrentcondition, with no long-term cure. Based on results of IDT,hyposensitisation injections are useful in preventing thiscondition or any other atopic dermatitis. Injections are usuallyrecommended for at least one year, and continue thereafterbased on the clinical response of the patient (White 2015).The aim of the therapy is to control and prevent acuteexacerbations (Pilsworth and dermatitis an IgE mediated type I hypersensitivityresponse to environmental allergens. The condition may beseasonal or nonseasonal, depending on the allergensinvolved (White 2015). Clinical signs of atopic dermatitis inhorses may include urticaria and/or pruritus; usually affectingthe face, distal legs or trunk (White 2005). The most effectiveway to prevent and control this condition is by identifying thetriggering allergens and reducing exposure.In clinical cases, the response to glucocorticoids is usually prompt and administration of dexamethasone at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg bwt may result in complete resolution (White 2015). For cases requiring ongoing therapy, once daily administration of 1 mg/kg bwt of prednisolone orally, followed by gradual reduction of the dose, proved to be effective with a low likelihood for adverse effects (Littlewood 2011). Resolution of the pruritus or urticaria has been achieved by the use of prednisolone at 200 -400 mg/500 kg administered orally once daily, or dexamethasone at 0.05 - 0.1 mg/kg bwt, either by the enteral or parenteral route, once daily (White 2005). Vasculitis Vasculitis is a histopathological term that implies the presenceof in flammatory changes in the walls of blood vessels, and it is associated with a broad spectrum of disorders. In horses,vasculitis is most often seen as a feature of drug reactions,urticaria, photosensitisation or purpura haemorrhagica (Whiteet al. 2009). Glucocorticoids recommended in the treatment of equine cutaneous vasculitis due to both their anti-inflammatory and immune-suppressive effects (White 2014). The use of prednisolone at 1 mg/kg bwt given orally twice daily ordexamethasone at 0.08 -0.2 mg/kg bwt once daily have been described in a retrospective study (White 2009). The previouslymentioned glucocorticoid treatment was administered for2 weeks, and then tapered over the next 4 -6w e e k s . I n t h i s study, the clinical response was variable, and recurrence of the condition was observed in approximately 25% of the cases (White 2009). Purpura haemorrhagica is characterised by leucocytoclastic vasculitis leading haemorrhage the mucosa and subcutaneous tissue ( Fig 3 ). The disease has been recognised as a sequela to complexes primarily composed of IgM or IgA and streptococcal M protein may be present in capillaries, leading to a type III hypersensitivity reaction. Prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids (2 -4w e e k s ) h a s resulted in a favourable outcome and low relapse rate (Kaese et al. 2005). Depending on the severity of clinical signs, the proposed dosage is 0.04 -0.2 mg/kg bwt of dexamethasone once or twice daily or 0.5 -1.0 mg/kg bwt of prednisolone orally once or twice daily, with a gradual reduction of the dosage (Aleman and Watson 2015a). Doses of prednisolone as high as 2 mg/kg bwt twice daily have been used for prolonged periods (Kaese et al. 2005). Pemphigus foliaceus Pemphigus foliaceus is an andhistologically by intraepidermal acantholysis. The clinicallesions recognised in horses are primarily scaling and crusting(Vandenabeele et al. 2004). The recommended treatment is glucocorticoids, such as prednisolone at 1 mg/kg bwt at 0.08 -0.1 mg/kg bwt orally once daily, then tapering (White 2009). In aretrospective study, horses with pemphigus foliaceus werereported to have been in remission for 1 -3 years, some of them receiving medications for up to 12 months(prednisolone 0.5 -1 mg/kg bwt orally every VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8(Vandenabeele et al. 2004). The prognosis following treatment for pemphigus foliaceus in horses is guarded, andthe response varies (White 2009). Many horses require lifelongadministration of medication to control the clinical signs,others may be gradually weaned from medication withoutfurther relapse (White 2009). Nervous system The use of glucocorticoids for conditions involving the centralnervous system is controversial. There is a lack of evidence forbene ts of glucocorticoid use in large animals, and recommendations have been extrapolated from humans andsmall animals. The use of these drugs is based on the fact thatthey are thought to stabilise microvasculature permeability,reduce pressure anddecrease oxygen-derived radicals (Dowling 2004). Infectious conditions The use of glucocorticoids to treat cases of equineencephalitis (eastern, western, Venezuelan, equineherpesvirus 1 and West Nile virus) and equine protozoalmyeloencephalitis (EPM) remains controversial, since all ofthese conditions are caused by infectious organisms (Long2014). In immunosuppressed horses, there is a concern aboutrecrudescence of infection and clinical relapse with the useof glucocorticoids in these conditions (Dirikolu et al. 2013; MacKay 2015). However, in addition to the supportive care,treatment of in flammation associated with these diseases is described using dexamethasone at a suggested doses of0.05 -0.1 mg/kg bwt administered i.v. or i.m. once or twice daily for 1 -3 days (MacKay 2015). For cases of EPM, the available literature recommends that use of glucocorticoidsshould be reserved for horses that exhibit signs of braininvolvement or recumbency; and dexamethasone at a doseof 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v., once or twice daily for the rst several days has been described (Howe et al. 2014; Reed et al. 2016). It has been also suggested to restrict the use of glucocorticoids to 1 -3 days of treatment with dexamethasone at 0.05 mg/kg bwt every 12 h only in horses severely affected by EPM (Dirikolu et al. 2013). However, there is no scienti c evidence demonstrating any positive effect after the use of systemic glucocorticoids for treatment of EPM. Long-term glucocorticoid treatment should be avoided due to the effects upon immune clearance of the causative agent (Dubey et al. 2015). The use of glucocorticoids in horses with bacterial meningitis is controversial, with diverse results among studies in species other than horses. One human study showed that there is a bene t in survival rate in adults affected with bacterial meningitis with the use of dexamethasone in the acute phase of the disease (Fritz et al. 2012). However, a clinical trial in 2029 human patients with bacterial meningitis showed no signi cant reduction in death or neurological disability betweendexamethasone and placebo treated groups (van de Beek et al. 2010). In a retrospective study of 28 horses with meningitis and meningoencephalomyelitis, treatment with a single dose of dexamethasone (dose not recorded) was reported for ve of the horses. No signi cant difference in outcome was found with this therapy; however, the small sample size was a limitation in the study (Toth et al. 2012). a) b) Fig 3: Lesions characteristic of purpura hemorrhagica in horses, showing haemorrhage in the muzzle region (a), and lesions onthe limbs with vasculitis, necrosis and exudate (b, photography courtesy Dr Sarah Ujvari). \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd219 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8A positive outcome was reported in a case report of presumed parasitic encephalitis, in which recovery was observed after treatment with dexamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v. once daily for 5 days, along with anthelmintic and antimicrobial medications (Wilford et al. 2013). Head trauma The use of glucocorticoids in horses with head traumaremains controversial, and effects such as reduction ofcerebral oedema, improvement in brain perfusion andmembrane stabilisation, suggested purposes oftheir 2010; Hurcombe 2015). The effect oftreatment with glucocorticoids in cases of head traumaremains unclear, and it is no longer recommended inhuman patients, based on clinical trials showing an increasein short- and long-term mortality in adults treated withsteroids after traumatic head trauma (Czekajlo andMilbrandt 2005; Edwards et al. 2005). There is no evidence that glucocorticoids improve the outcome or reducehuman intracranial pressure (Bullock and Povlishock 2007). Inhorses, the use of dexamethasone, prednisolone, andmethylprednisolone is reported in cases of head trauma,and a retrospective study showed that dexamethasone wasthe most commonly used at a dose ranging from 0.03 to0.08 mg/kg bwt administered i.v. (Feary et al. 2007). In this study, there was lack of evidence to support the use of this treatment in horses, where associations between treatments and nonsurvival were not performed (Feary et al. 2007). Another source suggests the use of dexamethasone at adose of 0.1 -0.2 mg/kg bwt i.v. every 6 to 8 h for the rst 24 h after the head trauma, and then once daily for2-3 days; however, the value of this treatment protocol is uncertain in horses with a nonin flammatory cerebral injury (Divers 2008). Spinal cord injury The use of glucocorticoids is controversial in cases of acute,severe human spinal cord injury; only small neurologicalimprovements have been demonstrated withmethylprednisolone used shortly after the acute onset ofclinical signs (Bracken et al. 1992). Methylation increases the lipophilic characteristics of methylprednisolone, enhancingcell penetration. It has been observed in man that plasmaconcentrations are linear and proportional to the dose, andnot determined by plasma protein binding as it occurs withprednisolone; even though the chemistry of both drugs is thesame, these characteristics give methylprednisoloneincreased ef cacy in the face of plasma protein variations (Rohatagi et al. 1997). Similarly in horses, the use of glucocorticoids for spinal trauma remains controversial, and if they have any bene t, it is likely in the acute stage and should be given early (Hurcombe 2010). The use of methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 10 -30 mg/kg bwt i.v. within 1 hour from trauma, has been described; however, itsuse is rare and there are no reports describing the ef cacy (Divers 2008). Another source described the use ofmethylprednisolone sodium succinate as a bolus of 25 mg/kgbwt i.v. shortly after the spinal cord trauma, followed by aconstant rate infusion at 5 -8 mg/kg bwt/h i.v. for 23 h (Hurcombe 2015). Reported dosages of dexamethasone forspinal cord trauma range from 0.1 to 0.3 mg/kg bwt i.v. every6-24 h for 2 -4 days (Divers 2008; Nout 2010). The main purpose of the therapy with dexamethasone is to reduceinflammation, thereby decreasing cytokine release and free radicals (Nout 2010). Based on a pharmacokinetics study comparing dexamethasone and prednisolone after i.v. and i.m. administration in horses, it was determined that dexamethasone has a higher volume of distribution and longer half-life, which are desired characteristics when trying to reach therapeutic drug concentrations in tissues (Toutain et al. 1984). It is then inferred that dexamethasone will be the drug of choice if glucocorticoid administration is elected to treat head or spinal cord trauma, followed by methylprednisolone. For cases of cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM), glucocorticoids may reduce the oedema associated with spinal cord compression, and provide transient improvement of the clinical signs; however, full recovery, if feasible, will not be achieved without dietary or surgical intervention (Rush 2009). In one retrospective study, there was a report of horses treated with flunixin meglumine at 1 mg/kg bwt orally every other day alternated with dexamethasone at 0.02 mg/kg bwt orally every other day for 30 days; and when compared to other types of treatments such as vitamin E supplementation, dimethyl sulfoxide, dietary changes, osteoarthritis medications, and exercise restriction, there was no signi cant effect on prognosis (Hoffman and Clark 2013). Another retrospective study showed clinical improvement in 3 out of 5 horses with CVSM treated with glucocorticoids by referring veterinarians; a total of 22 cases of CVSM wereanalysed, but neither the name of the medication, dosages nor duration of therapy was provided (Levine et al. 2007). Other systemic uses of glucocorticoids Immune-mediated haemolytic autologous antibodies directed against theanimal 's own red blood cells. It can occur as a primary idiopathic disorder, but it is more often associated withanother primary disease process. Secondary autoimmunehaemolytic anaemia in horses has been associated withconditions such as purpura haemorrhagica, lymphoma,chronic bacterial infections and medications, especiallyprocaine penicillin (Weiss and Moritz 2003; Carlson 2009;Cottle and Hughes 2010; Johns et al. 2011). Glucocorticoids are often used to disrupt the immune response, and a suggested therapy is the use ofdexamethasone at an initial dose of 0.05 -0.1 mg/kg bwt every 24 h for a 450 kg horse, given parenterally. This dosecan be continued for 3 -5 days, then decreased gradually over 7 -14 days (Carlson 2009). If there has been no response in 5 -7 days, the diagnosis should be reviewed. Once the haemolytic process is under control, treatment can betransitioned to orally administered prednisolone at a dosageof 0.8 -1 mg/kg bwt once 2009). Dexamethasone at 0.04 -0.06 mg/kg bwt i.v. given once daily has been reported to be effective in cases of immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia secondary to Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals, together with antimicrobial treatment and supportive care; and once the clinicalcondition improved, the dexamethasone was tapered over a25 day period (Johns et al. 2011). It is important to determine if the cause of the immune-mediated process is the use of amedication that needs to be discontinued, or an infectious \u00a92016 EVJ Ltd220 EQUINE VETERINARY EDUCATION / AE / APRIL 201 8process, in which case the therapy should be directed at theprimary agent and glucocorticoids might be contraindicated(Carlson 2009; Cottle and Hughes 2010). Response toglucocorticoid therapy is usually positive (Carlson 2009; Johnset al. 2011); however, in a report of a case of immune- mediated anaemia and thrombocytopenia, there was noresponse to doses as high as 0.2 mg/kg bwt i.v. once daily ofdexamethasone, and the animal was subjected toeuthanasia (McGovern et al. 2011; V \u20aca\u20acan\u20acanen et al. 2013). Neoplasia Lymphoma is one of the most common malignant neoplasmsin the horse and originates from the lymphoid system (Taintor2015). Neoplastic lymphocytes may arise from for gammopathiesand immune-mediated processes. Lymphomas of B-cell,T-cell, and mixed B- and T-cell origin have been reported(Rendle et al. 2012). Equine classi solitary tumours of extranodal sites. Clinicalsigns may vary depending on the organs involved, however,horses more commonly present with weight loss, anorexia, orlethargy (Taintor 2015). Glucocorticoids for treatment of lymphoma have been used alone or in conjunction of chemotherapeutic agents. In acase report of a horse diagnosed with a T-cell rich, B-celllymphoma, cyclophosphamide and vincristine were used withdexamethasone at 0.04 mg/kg bwt orally on Day 1, and thendecreased to 0.02 mg/kg bwt orally once daily from Day 2 to30; this protocol was followed by the use of acyclovir, due tothe horse testing positive for equine herpesvirus-5. Theoutcome was positive and one year after initiation of therapythe horse was reported to be in remission and had returned toits normal activities (Vander Werf and Davis 2013). Anotherprotocol used prednisolone at 1.1 -2.2 mg/kg bwt orally every 24 h, with the concomitant use of cyclophosphamide andcytosine arabinoside (Taintor and Schleis 2011). The duration ofthe glucocorticoid therapy is usually the same as the durationof the chemotherapy. Most of the chemotherapeuticprotocols range from 2 to 3 months, then followed by amaintenance protocol consistent of gradual decreases ofprednisolone (Aleman and Watson 2015b). Recurrence of theclinical signs are often observed once the therapy isdiscontinued (Taintor and Schleis 2011; Aleman and Watson2015b). Therapy may be also attempted with glucocorticoidsalone; using dexamethasone at 0.2 mg/kg bwt orally or i.v.once daily for 5 days, followed by prednisolone 1 -2 mg/kg bwt orally once daily; however, the clinical response in affected horses after the use of this protocol was not described (Aleman and Watson 2015b). Treatment of a horse diagnosed with an angiotrophic T-cell lymphoma using one dose of dexamethasone at 0.1 mg/kg bwt i.v., followed by 10 days of prednisolone at 1 mg/kg bwt orally once daily, failed torespond to therapy and had a fatal outcome (Raidal et al. 2006). Although some periods of remission have been reported, the long-term prognosis for this condition has been poor, and glucocorticoid treatment in cases of lymphoma rarely ameliorate the clinical condition, even with the concomitant use of chemotherapeutic drugs (Raidal et al. 2006). Due to the low number of reported cases treated with chemotherapy, there is limited information available, and dosages are extrapolated from other species. Pharmacokinetic studies inhorses are needed to incorporate proper usage of these drugs. It is also dif cult to assess the effect of the glucocorticoids in cases of remission, since chemotherapy was used concomitantly; therefore, studies using glucocorticoids alone are necessary to make conclusions. Conclusion Glucocorticoids are known to be drugs with a potent andrapid effect to decrease in flammation and are successfully used to treat many systemic in flammatory conditions in horses. Adverse effects such as delayed wound healing, immunosuppression, laminitis, gastric ulceration or adrenalsuppression have been linked to the treatment with glucocorticoids, especially with higher doses or long duration of therapy (Flaminio et al. 2009; Bailey 2010; Ivester and Cou \u20acetil 2014). There is little scienti c evidence to support some of the attributed adverse effects of glucocorticoids in horses, such as the development of laminitis, which is based on anecdotal case reports (Bailey 2010). A study showed no correlation between treatment with glucocorticoids and the occurrence of gastric ulcers in racehorses (Murray et al. 1996); however, glucocorticoid therapy increases the risk of gastric ulceration in human patients and small animals (Boothe and Mealey 2012; Filaretova et al. 2014). More studies to identify the risk for the development of gastric ulcers in horses after high doses or prolonged therapies with glucocorticoids are warranted. Depending on the condition to be treated and the severity, there is a wide variation of dosages among the literature reviewed, and the decision whether or not to use steroidal anti-in flammatory medications should be supported by historical and physical examination ndings, and laboratory data and followed by close monitoring (Ivester and Cou \u20acetil 2014).
