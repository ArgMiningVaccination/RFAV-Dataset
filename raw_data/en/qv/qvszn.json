State Historian Doane Robinson created the program to erect markers at significant historical locations across the state. At this time, the SDSHS was a public organi zation and not an official part of state government. Contributions from the SDSHS funded the first markers. Robinson and interested members of the SDSHS identified potential sites and then raised money for the markers. Interested members contributed money both for specific markers and also for those to be purchased at Robinson's discretion. Funding for these early markers was often a cooperative effort between the SDSHS and interested groups. The Department of Transportation, through its Publicity Division (forerunner of the Department of Tourism), often contributed to the erection of these markers along state highways. State Historian Will Robinson (son of Doane) continued the program reaching out to many local historical societies and civic grou ps who raised money to purchase markers in their communities. When the SDSHS became a part of state government, the program continued to purchase markers through donations. The marker program has always, and continues to be, primarily funded through private donations with very limited state funds expended on the program. NOTES ON THE MARKERS The marker texts presented below are how they appear on the markers themselves - errors, bad grammar, cultural insensitivities and various spellings included. NOTES ON THIS INVENTORY The markers are listed numerically. There are gaps in the number sequence. Many numbers were historically assigned to small plaques and directional arrows (example: \"Marker One Mile Ahead,\" that are not text specific to a site. These have not been included. Other markers have gone missing over time and there is no record of them, other than an assigned number in the file. These have not been included because the ir original text and/or current location are unknown. 2 Table of Contents (with page number) 100th Meridian, 21 100th Meridian Map Marker, 13 1900 Campaign Whistlestop by T.

Beltrami, a member, wrote is his journal that day, 'In the evening we st opped at the middle of the lake, just where it takes a northerly direction, where a magnificent wood and a little traders' settlement were crossed by the River of the White Herons or Ho -ka-San-be-Wa-kpa which falls into the lake on the southern side.'

Drawing nearer the awful bellowing of ten thousand enraged bulls was truly frightful. A short distance above this was a bay, which was crowded with buffalo swimming in all directi ons.

Stanley, 1st Cavalry, Col. E. Lee 2nd U.S. Inf. was its first permanent commander. In 1875, soldiers of the Post, members of the I.O.O.F lodge, wanting a lodge room, combined this idea with a church and library, designed by George Bush, the post carpenter, a discharged soldier and they built this structure from hand sawn chalkstone from nearby quarries, aided in the quarrying and transportation only by the U.S. Government. Otherwise, it was a n entirely private venture. You are standing in front of the church. From the north the structure looked like the sketch above with the lodge hall in the center. The fort was finally abandoned in 1892 and this ruin is its outstanding vestige. Two devast ating wind storms and a bolt of lightning wrecked the roof and rain and frost finished the work. Detailed drawings by cooperation of the Corp of Engineers and the National Park Service were made in 1947 and filed in the Library of Congress. The ruins 9 were stabilized by the Engineers in 1953.

Medary, son of the Governor, was the Engineer and Col . Wm. H. Nobles was its promoter and builder. A rock ford was made over the Big Sioux. The area of South Dakota east of the Big Sioux was ceded by the Yankton Sioux in 1859. The Sioux under a Yankton chief, Smutty Bear, regarding the white settlers as trespassers, determined to drive them away. A warning was sent to the settlers by Dr. Thos. S. Williamson. Their leader, Franklin J. DeWitt, prepared the settlers to resist but finally agreed to leave peaceably in June 1858. The Sioux burned their build ings and destroyed their crops. Flandreau was evacuated and only Sioux Falls remained until the Sioux Uprising in 1862. In 1869 permanent white settlement began in this vicinity, again known as Medary, with the Trygstads, Jermstads, and Chris Baltrud. Settlers were of Norwegian and American stock.

Westward the farms become progressively larger - the towns and cities more generously spaced. Ranching overshadows farming.

It's the West!

As these mountains slowly rose, large streams flowed east, carrying much rock and s ilt, deposited here as sandstones and clays, on the black shale, in their channels and flood plains. Some horizons also contain volcanic ash, blown in from the far west. Wind and water have since carved this 600 foot of stream deposits into our picturesq ue Badlands. In the Oligocene age, 30 million years ago, numerous mammalian and a few reptilian forms existed in the warm temperature climate of the epoch. Dying, many of their bones petrified under the moist sediments and these fossils are now being slo wly exposed by rain and wind. Some of these animals, the three -toed horse, tiny camel and deer, huge pigs and saber tooth cats are distant relatives of modern animals; others, like the oreodonts and bulky titanotheres became extinct while most numerous in this age. Today the Big Badlands represents the most important Oligocene deposits known to man and thousands of fossils have been yielded to the science of paleontology. They first became known to man in 1830, when the first great western trail from Ft. Tecumseh (Pierre) to Ft. William (Laramie) penetrated the Badlands by the pass South of Scenic and to the scientific world when Alexander Culbertson made a trip into them and sent out a cartload of fossils in 1843.\" Erected: replaced 1965 Location: Penni ngton County, Hwy 16 at Cedar Pass #261 Center of the United States \"For generations, the accepted Centre of the United States was near Smith Center, Kansas.

A village of intense rivalries, Upper Grand View, the original plat, the darling of the \"King\" Foster -Joe Devy interests, had a bank, the D.C.

They had been attracted to it by Indian legends that evil spirits in human form lived there. Reportedly, the little devils were eighteen inches high with large heads and were armed with arrows that could kill at great distance. 80 From the top, according to Clark's journal, the men enjoyed 'a most butiful landscape; numerous herds of buffalo were seen feeding in various directions.' The explorers decided correctly that the mound was a product of nature and not of man, e ven though it was some distance from other hills. Heat and thirst soon drove them to the Vermillion River, where they found water and 'delisious froot such as grapes, plumbs, and blue currents.' They reached the Missouri at sunset. Journeying onward, the members of the expedition spent the first winter in North Dakota among the Mandan Indians, the next on the Pacific coast, and then turned homeward, repassing this area in 1806 as they hurried down stream to St. Louis.

First observed by the Atkinson - O'Fallon Peace Treaty expedition of 1825, it was variously commented on by later river travelers. When Sully's expedition of 1863 was a short distance away, Captain John Fielner made a solo jaunt to see the rock. Observed by some Indians, who coveted his horse and gear, they killed him. Sully pursued them, captured and behead ed them, placing their heads on high poles as a warning to Indians who killed without cause.

Water spilled out of this lake and cut a channel of 50 to 90 feet below the present channel of the Minnesota River. The River Warren, a geological phenomenon, was named fo r Lt. Governor K. Warren, whose western topographic maps are justly famous. He was later a Union General in the Civil War and was the first District Engineer at St. Paul in 1866. As the glacier receded and Lake Agassiz dried up, the River Warren became less potent, sediment was deposited and the channel became as we see it today. The present channel is about two miles wide and from 100 to 130 feet in depth. Lake Traverse, flowing to Hudson's Bay, is nine feet above Big Stone Lake. Between them is the C ontinental Divide between the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson's Bay. You are viewing one of the geological indexes to ancient history. Another glacier, moving west and south, created the Missouri River and deflected the former channel of the Cheyenne River, as a tributary of the Red River of the North into the Missouri Channel. Burial Mounds Eastern South Dakota has a good many Burial Mounds, located in this roadside park and in Roberts County and elsewhere in the Big Sioux and James River Valleys. Well known Mounds are located west of Faulkton; in the Southside Park at Mitchell; near the mouth of 12 Mile Creek near Milltown; and at Sioux Falls; and nearby Brandon. It is believed they were created by basket -carried earth. Artifacts recovered included pottery, stone, knives, and hammers and both marine and fresh water shell beads. The Mounds are ordinarily on high terraces overlooking water courses.

The hostile band of about one -hundred and eighty Santees was led by Chief White Lodge. History states that they came upon the Santee encampment on the east side of the Missou ri River at a point opposite the mouth of the Grand River. The Santees drove a hard bargain and the young Tetons had to give all their worldly possessions, including their guns and horses, to effect the exchange. Only one horse and wagon was left to carr y the weak and distraught captives the one hundred miles back to the nearest white settlement at Ft. Pierre. The Tetons walked and gave their clothes to the white women and children. This Christian act of mercy by the Tetons was never rewarded by the U.S . Government and no record can be found of any repayment for the personal possessions given in exchange. Because the Santees had been on the warpath, the odds against success were very high.

Colonel Caleb Carlton of the Eighth Cavalry was post commander and with his wife di scussed the need for a national air. At her suggestion he concluded that it should be 'The Star Spangled Banner' whereupon he required that it should be played at retreat and at the close of parades and concerts. General Carlton wrote in 1914: 'When Gover nor Sheldon of South Dakota visited Fort Meade, our custom was explained to him. Later I attended a reception given by Governor Hastings of Pennsylvania at the Governor's mansion in Harrisburg and he promised me that he would try to have the custom establ ished among the state militia. Not long afterward I had an interview on the subject with the Secretary of War, Daniel E. Lamont, and my impression is that it was but a few months later that he issued an order requiring 'The State Spangled Banner' to be played at every Army post every evening at retreat. In addition to this I tried to enforce respect for our national flag by having every one rise and remove their hats when the colors passed them.'

His party entered the Black Hills via the old bison trail through Buffalo Gap near here. Born in New York State in 1799, Jed Smith came West from Ohio in 1822 to join Ashley expedition from St. Louis up the Missouri River. Later, he found the South Pass and was the first white man to reach California by the overland route. He is also credited with extensive exploration of the West Coast north to Canada. This skillful hunter, s uccessful fur trader, and pioneer explorer of the American West was a man who feared God and loved peace. His Bible was his constant companion. Jed Smith was a trail blazer whose three driving ambitions were to serve God, to provide for his family, and t o explore the unmapped American West. He was successful in attaining all three goals. During the course of his Western explorations, Jed Smith survived many perilous experiences, including an encounter with a grizzly bear near this spot. In 1831 near the Cimarron River, he was killed by a Comanche lance. His body was never found.

Pierre - Deadwood and Sidney, Nebraska -Deadwood. These trails headed northwest to Crook City a mile south of the present town of Whitewood and over to Deadwood. Later, enterprising local people built a toll road up Bear Butte and Boulder Creeks to Deadwood, cutting the long route by many miles. With the coming of the railroads in 1886 these trails began phasing out as freight and passenger lines. However, many segments of the roads were used by individual pioneers and homesteaders. In fact, Interstate 90 just above us was built from Rapid City to Whitewood on virtually the same roadbed as the pioneer gold trails.

The building which houses the rest rooms and tourist information center is fashioned after the sod houses and dugouts which dotted the South Da kota prairie during the pioneering days. Four miles north of here the town of Salem reflects the influence of the railroad in opening Dakota Territory to settlement. Salem, named after the Massachusetts community, was platted in 1880 and for two years aft er was the most important railroad point between Sioux Falls and Mitchell. The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway reached Salem in the fall and winter of 1880 -81, but the blizzard of 1881 prevented the lines immediate use. During the summer of 1883 the Dakota Central division of the Chicago and Northwestern Railway was completed through town. In 1882 Salem, then called Melas, became the third county seat for McCook County in the space of four years, a status it has retained. Although the ra ilroads no longer have the influence of years ago, communities such as Salem serve as reminders that railroads often led, rather than followed, settlement.\" Erected : 1977 Location : McCook County, I -90- exit 362 (2006) #483 Homestead Rest Area \"The rich farm country of southeast South Dakota lies in the triangle formed at the Missouri River to the west and the Big Sioux River east of here flow toward their confluence about 37 miles southeast of this point. This was the land that drew settlers to Dakota T erritory. What may have been the number one entry in the United States under the Homestead Act was filed near here. Just minutes after midnight on Jan. 1 1863 when the Homestead Act went into effect. Vermillion printer Mahlon Gore filed his claim for 159 \u00bd acres on a site about seven miles due east of here, some three -and-one-half miles north of present -day S.D. Highway 50. Although he gained a measure of fame for filing first, he never proved up on his claim and it lapsed. Most of the early settlement of South Dakota occurred in this southeast corner of the state. Sioux Falls, the state's largest city, 50 miles north, was settled in 1857. To the west, Vermillion was established in 1859, Yankton in 1858. Highway 50, which runs east -west past this rest ar ea, forms a corridor in time to Territorial days of South Dakota. Union County, Clay County, and Yankton County along this Highway were among the earliest to be organized in Dakota Territory in 1862. Their names were reminiscent of the times. Union Coun ty, originally called Cole, was renamed in 1864 because of northern sentiment existing during the Civil War. Clay County took its name from the famed senator 114 Henry Clay. Yankton County derived its title from the Sioux tribe which gave up that area in an 1859 land cession. The city of Yankton, 33 miles west along the Missouri River, was a major steamboat port in Dakota Territory. That status helped make it the capital city of Dakota from 1861 -1883. Yankton has often been called the 'Mother City of the Da kotas' and it retains much of the luster of those days. Education was a key interest with early legislators. Vermillion eight miles west of here on Highway 50, exhibits that in the University of South Dakota. Vermillion was designated as the site for the territorial university in 1862, although the institution (then called University of Dakota) did not begin classes until 1882 with 35 students.

Just south of the town of Garretson. There, Split Rock Creek has eroded a gorge through billion -year old red rock know as Sioux quartzite, one of the oldest geological formations in South Dakota. Indian legend says that these rock terraces and deep gorges were formed when an Indian god threw a tomahawk from the spirit world, cleaving this canyon in the plains. At Garretson is the narrow gorge known as Devil's Gulch. Frontier legend asserts that outlaws Jesse and Frank James hid in a cave above Split Rock Creek after their bank robbery in Northfield, Minnesota. When J esse abandoned the hiding place, he found a posse in close pursuit and spurred his horse into a great leap over the Gulch to make his escape. A few miles span the gap from frontier legend to prairie history. Sioux Falls 13 miles west, was one of the earli est settlements in South Dakota (1857). It grew rapidly to become the largest community in the state in the 1890's. South Dakota has many footprints of the space age. At Sioux Falls, the first atomic power plant in the United States to use an internal nu clear super heater operated from 1964 to 1967. Appropriately, the plant was named pathfinder in honor of John C. Fremont, who explored part of South Dakota in 1838 -39. Near Garretson is the Earth Resources Observation System (EROS) Data Center, where the space age is today. The EROS Center stores millions of high altitude and satellite photos of the earth's surface and derives information from them in an outstanding example of the benefits of space exploration to humanity.

He said, upon his arrival, 'There is not a tree in sight, nor sign of human habitation, only paths made by Indians and Buffalo leading to a flowing spring near by.' This spri ng led to his decision to settle here. Today it is symbolized by the lighted fountain on this site. Kennedy took up a tree claim and homesteaded on the adjoining 320 acres of land which today comprises a portion of the city of Madison. He built a tempora ry sod house and envisioned a town site here because of its central location and the likelihood that a railroad would come to his holding. As anticipated, the first train arrived on January 12, 1881. In 1880 Kennedy was named Territorial Representative to the legislature which convened in Yankton. His crowning achievement was the passage of legislation which found the city of Madison on its present site. This presaged a struggle between the towns of old Madison and Herman which was resolved only after a bitter rivalry. The new town was established in July 1880 and the county seat moved here in late December following the mysterious removal of the county safe from old Madison and its appearance on the main street of the new town. Major legislation achie ved by Kennedy provided that Dakota Normal School would be located in Madison under legislative act of February 28, 1881. He deeded 20 acres of land, on which the college is located, with the provision that it would be held in perpetuity so long as the in stitution retained its objective as a teacher education school. Charles B. Kennedy was born in a log house in Moscow, Maine, March 28, 1840. He married Mae Ella Williams May 20, 1873 and they had two sons, C. Leroy and Dean M. Kennedy. Kennedy became a t eacher, publisher, banker and real estate developer. After a grade school education in a log school house he attended Pittsfield Institute and later Maine State College. He served a term as District Superintendent of Schools before leaving to go west to L eRoy, Minnesota, where he established a newspaper known as the 'LeRoy Independent'. After four years he went further west to settle at what is now Madison. Kennedy was organizer of several banks and loan and real estate companies in Madison. His career included election to the House of Representatives of the Territorial Legislature meeting in Yankton in 1880 -81 and to a session meeting in Bismarck in 1886 -87.

On October 10, 1888, Ryan platted the town into 43 city blocks and named the streets after various kinds of stone. He named the new town 'Rowena' for the heroine in Sir Walter Scott's novel, 'Ivanhoe'. Ryan co ntracted with Madison and Winfield Webster to open stone quarries on their adjacent farm. He formed the Minnehaha Granite Company and erected the 'Mastadon Jasper Crusher', the first stone crusher in Dakota Territory. The artistry and skill of immigrant Welsh and English stone cutters was soon evident in the quartzite buildings designed by 'Prairie Architect' Wallace Dow and others. Many miles of streets were paved with hundreds of railroad cars of cobblestones from area quarries, shipped to Omaha, Kansa s City, Chicago, Detroit and other cities. A post office was established October 17, 1888. The new town included a town hall, railway depot, the Dixon Hotel, a tenement, meat market, the 'Black Diamond' saloon, a livery barn, creamery and blacksmith shop. During the spring of 1889, a publication, the 'Skyrocket', appeared and the first babies born in Rowena were named for the town: a boy, Rowein Costine and a girl, Rowena Jones. The Illinois Central Railroad built a stockyard which prospered because of its direct access to the Chicago markets. Later two grain elevators, a store building and a quartzite bank building were added and in 1902 the Methodist Episcopal Church was built. Following the Depression of the 1930's and the growing use of cement, the quar ry industry declined and Rowena became a quiet trade center for area farmers.\" 122 Erected : 1989 Location : Minnehaha County, SD 42 west side of Rowena (2006) #503 William J.

Receiving an LLB in 1893 from the University of Michigan, he came to South Dakota and opened a law practice in Beresford, where he served as mayor and city attorney before his election as governor of South Dakota on the Democratic ticket in 1926 and 1928. A life -long Cleveland Democrat, the governor incurred the wrath of New Deal President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In 1932 and 1936, Bulow was elected to the U.S. Senate, where he was instrumental in securing for Beresford its mode rn post office, dedicated in 1940. He also played a role in the routing of U.S. Highway 77 through the town's main thoroughfare. Before retiring from public life in 1942, Senator Bulow made many similar contributions to the community, state and nation.

The next year surveying was conducted throughout the summer and the town of Midland, named for its location halfway between the Missouri and the South Fork of Cheyenne River, was established. Construction started in 1890 when J.C. 'Charlie' Ru ssell hauled a load of supplies from Pierre and built the first store in Midland. Also built that year was a hotel and restaurant operated by Addie Avenell. Charles Baker was sworn in as first Postmaster. Charlie Russell later served as Postmaster for 2 1 years. The first wedding took place in 1895 when Charlie Russell married Emily Hall's daughter, Jennie. Their daughter, Grace, was the first born child in Midland and the first of two high school graduates. Several businesses opened in 1904 including a livery stable, the 'Western Star' newspaper, and a small furniture and undertaking store. In 1905 Christopher Hellekson built a grocery store in east Midland and moved it the following year to the present town site operating it until his death in 1916. Al so built in 1905 in east Midland and later moved to the present town site was the Bastion Roundhouse. In 1939, owners John and Violet Stroppel added an artesian well for hot mineral baths. 1906 was boom time for Midland. The Bank of Midland was granted a charter, a hardware store was opened and regular train service began. In 1907 fifteen lots were sold ranging in price from $100 for residential property to a $700 corner business lot to J.C. Leggett for a feed business. In May the Great Western Telephone Company's west bound line arrived and passenger train service to Rapid City began on October 15 and continued until October, 1960. The Midland State Bank opened in 1908 but closed January 8, 1932. A new schoolhouse was built on the hill in 1909 and opene d for classes in 1910. The Bank of Midland opened in 1909 in a new building constructed of Stanley County brick and Black Hills sandstone. This building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 123 In the following years many advances were made in Midland including sidewalks in 1920 (many more built as WPA projects in 1936 and 1939), electricity in 1919, a water system in 1925, a sewer system in 1947 -1948, a municipal artesian well in 1960 and a second one in 1968, and a new water tank and treat ment plant in 1982.

The siding consisted of four short, fan -shaped tracks and a hand - operated turntable over an open pit used for servicing engines. There was also a small m achine shop. The railroad planned to use this installation as a permanent location for their yards and as a terminal, since it was near the junction of the main rail line to the coal fields of Wyoming and the branch line into the Black Hills. After two at tempts to secure additional adjacent property needed for expansion failed, the Burlington purchased land from a homesteader, Hand Carsley, on the south side of the Cheyenne River and constructed what was to become a permanent terminal - - thus Edgemont, 'e dge of the mountains,' was born in the summer of 1890, growing into and remaining a thriving railroad town.

Oaks1. The next year, the Worthington & Sioux Falls Railroad extended its line to Salem, South Dakota, and established a station at Oaksville. By 1881, the town, now platted into eight blocks, was renamed Hartford because many of its settlers came from Hartford, Connecticut. On August 21, 1896, the citizens of the Town of Hartford voted to incorporate. Although Hartford has had many distinguished citizens who have contributed to the development and progress of the community and state, two early legislators represent the end of one era and the beginning of the new. Carl Albert Soderberg represents the end of the territorial era. Born in Sweden in 1852, Soderberg emigrated to the United States in 1869 and came to Hartford in 1876, homesteading in a sod house and serving as to wn clerk for several years. An active member of the Farmers' Alliance, he served as secretary of the county and territorial organizations. In 1888, he was elected on the Republican Party ticket to serve in the last territorial legislature. Henry C. Aulwe s represents the beginning of a new era as he was the first Hartford area resident to serve in the state legislature. Born in Iowa in 1847, Aulwes came to Dakota Territory in 1882 and served on the Hartford board of supervisors for six years, three as cha irman. He also served as justice of the peace for two years. In 1896, Aulwes was elected to the State House of Representatives on the Fusion Party ticket and served one term. At the time of his death in 1899, Aulwes was preparing to run for governor of South Dakota. The careers of these two men not only mark periods of South Dakot a history, they also symbolize the industrious nature of the men and women whose contributions make Hartford's history rich and its roots deep.

Owner and editor, Friedrich Wilhlem Sallet, emigrated from East Prussia and published DFP for Germa ns from Russia with NDP for Reich Germans. Aberdeen was a hub for both groups. Begun in 1874 in Yankton, the DFP was purchased by Sallet in 1903 and moved to Aberdeen in 1909. 1 Elihu Increase Oaks (1841 -1912) [information from descendant, June 2020, in SHPO file]. 125 The DFP was 'the oldest and most widely distributed newspaper for Germans fr om Russia in the world.' It claimed to have subscribers in 1,500 communities on four continents. Sallet used the DFP as headquarters for a relief department which sent packages to famished Soviet villages in 1921 and four shiploads of dairy cows to suppl y milk to German orphanages. The DFP carried columns for people seeking addresses of 'lost' individuals, operated as a clearing house on land and immigration, and in 1924 became the first U.S. paper allowed re -entry into the Soviet Union. Wrongly suspecte d of being pro -German, Sallet and his NDP editor, J.F. Paul Gross, were arrested in 1918 and charged for not filing English translations of two articles with the post office. Following the trial, Gross was interned in Georgia while Sallet paid a fine and legal costs. Sallet was defended by Dorothy Rehfeld, the first female attorney to practice in S.D. The NDP ceased publication in January 1918. In 1920, the DFP moved to Minnesota and continued until 1954. After Sallet's death in 1932, his nephew (Dr. R ichard Dallet) became editor.

A messenger arrived from the Great West with news of a wonderful water which, he said, had been touched by the finger of the Great Spirit and would cure all manner of diseases. In dians came to these springs by the thousands. After a lapse of more than 200 years, the Cheyenne took possession of the springs and built an immense tipi city covering hundreds of acres. In the following years, the Sioux migrated west and disputed the owne rship of the springs. This culminated in a fierce conflict in about 1869, the memory of which is preserved in the name of 126 the eminence to the east, Battle Mountain, where the besieged Cheyenne established fortifications. The Sioux won the battle and poss ession of the springs which they called Wi -wi- lah-kah-to (Springs -hot). They called the area Minnekahta (Water -hot) and termed the Black Hills a great 'Medicine Home.\" After the Battle Mountain fight, tradition says the Sioux and Cheyenne agreed to allow the springs to be a health sanctuary to give their sick and lame the benefit of the healing waters.

Runkel's peak year was May 1941 to April 1942 when 51,743 tons were sold. During peak demand as many as 30 truckers were paid 35 cents a ton for loading and hauling from pits to railcars. Ben Dollarhide bought Runkel out in 1947 and formed Dewey County Coal Company. Dollarhide purchased a tracked shovel for filling trucks 141 in the large pit and a D -8 Cat to help strip overburden. He built a large tipple (machine for loading freight) to speed loading. A record 552 tons went through the tipple in one day. Spoil banks are visible west of town. The bucket displayed is from the last dragline, the Monighan. The town was also a bustling trade center through the teens, 1920's and 1930's. It boasted a bank, Holts' flour mill, many business, 70 miles of rural telephone lines and a light plant provided 24 hour service. Stockyards next to the rail line enabled the t own to serve as a major livestock shipping point. As coal mining was mechanized and less manual labor was required, Firesteel began to decline. Fires claimed many businesses and in the 1960's the mine and the school both closed. Today most area resident s are engaged in ranching and farming.

Camps and work projects were s upervised by another 2834 men. The Office of Indian Affairs ran smaller units for 4554 American Indians. Camp LaCreek was part of a national CCC program to develop waterfowl refuges. Supervised by the Bureau of Biological Survey the CCC and WPA developed 9302 acres of LaCreek National Wildlife Refuge from a natural marsh and several ranches. They built levees, roads, boundary fence and an observation tower and planted shrubs, trees, marsh plants and small grains creating 11 pools with water, food and cov er for wildlife. Today the 16,410 acres provide habitat for 250 species of birds and 50 other animals. LaCreek is home for thousands of waterfowl, pelicans and, in winter, to 250 trumpeter swans.

This area was officially opened for settlement by the Homestead Act of 1862 and adventurous pioneers traveled the stage road (now Cliff Avenue) into town. At that time, two stage coach routes crossed near the east side of present day Cassidy Park. The unpopulated area was attractive to settlers because of the many underground springs that supplied Beaver Creek. Valley Springs derived its name from the springs that were located in the valley. Before suitable 142 timber was available, in itial construction consisted of dugout homes and the first commercial building served as a store and lodging for travelers. Eventually, lumber was hauled from Sibley, IA, on a crudely marked freight trail. Jonathan Dunham, known as the \"Father of the Va lley Springs', made application for the post office in 1873, and initiated the town's incorporation in 1878. Private homes acted as schools and churches until 1878 when a school building and church were erected. This same year saw the arrival of the firs t passenger train in Dakota Territory from the East. With the introduction of the railroad, the town's 'Boom Years' began. Four hotels were built and two newspapers were published. A newly organized fire department offered the town and surrounding area protection from deadly prairie fires. The 'Air Dom', a uniquely constructed dance hall, was a social gathering spot. For ventilation, the sides of the dome were raised. In the late 1800's, Valley Springs was the area's largest grain and livestock shippi ng point. Rich, fertile land helped agriculture flourish. The town's major industry was the Valley Springs Rolling Mill Co., a four story plant with an output of 200 barrels of flour per day. The mill, first in the county to be run by steam, shipped fou r brands of flour to the East and overseas daily. With the introduction of the automobile and the loss of passenger trains to the area, industry declined. Valley Springs remains a quiet and friendly residential community with a rich history.

Without protection, farms and towns were vulnerab le to prairie fires which might ignite very quickly and then burn fiercely for miles, subject to the whim and velocity of the wind. Many territorial newspaper editors were prompted to plead for an organized defense against this merciless element of nature . In the 1870's Sioux Falls was threatened with several fires, causing considerable community uneasiness. A volunteer bucket brigade, equipped with leather buckets, was formed in 1877 to ease this anxiety. A raging fire, starting north of Sioux Falls in 1879, took the life of Mrs. John Fortune, a farm woman caught in its path. The fire then swept down 'Brewery Hill' (North Main Ave.) threatening downtown Sioux Falls. Only the valiant effort of townspeople kept damage at a minimum. In 1880, a group of volunteer firefighters organized the Cascade Hook and Ladder Company. Four years later a 2,600 lb. fire bell was purchased by the City Council and mounted in a fire tower (NE corner of 9th St. and Dakota Ave.), but within the year, a lightning bolt split the fire tower from top to bottom. By 1889, the volunteer fire department included a hook and ladder company, a two horse combination hose wagon, several hose companies and a chemical company. The volunteer firemen were the pride of the city and received praise and honors for their skills and efficiency. Even so, the volunteers were not able to quell the disastrous fire which destroyed the landmark Cataract Hotel, the social center of the city, on June 30, 1900 (NW corner of 9th St. and Phillips Ave.). T he citizens of Sioux Falls were shocked into the realization that their growing city needed highly trained, full -time paid firefighters. In response, a month later the 143 City Council created an eight man salaried fire department, augmented by 15 'minute men ' unpaid volunteers. This firefighting facility, the Central Fire Station, when built in 1912, was 'the only building in South Dakota to be used exclusively for fire purposes'. The old 1885 fire alarm bell was installed in an 80 ft. bell tower. The tower was also used for the hanging and drying of fire hoses. The station had 11 horse stalls in the back with a hay loft on the second floor. When the fire bell sounded, the horses were trained to quickly trot to their places in front of the fire wagons wher e suspended harnesses were dropped on their backs and snapped into place. The horses were retired and replaced by motorized fire trucks in 1917. An era had ended.

Little Crow ordered White Lodge's band, camped near Lake Benton, Minnesota, to drive out the settlers along the Dakota border and in the Big Sioux River valley. On August 25, 1862, Judge Joseph B. Amidon and his son, William, were slain by Indians while making hay near the north edge of Sioux Falls. Territoria l Governor William Jayne ordered evacuation of the settlement. Following the Yankton Stage Trail, the settlers fled to Yankton, led by a detachment of Dakota Cavalry. In November, a scouting party under Captain Nelson Miner returned to Sioux Falls. Inclu ded in the party were a number of civilians who had been residents of Sioux Falls before its evacuation. Many of the civilians had cached goods which they now wished to recover. Using caution, the scouting party camped overnight on the south side of the Big Sioux River near the present location of the Yankton Trail Bridge. They continued at dawn and when 'they reached the top of the south hills' (present day 14th Street between Dakota and Minnesota Avenues) they not only discovered the settlement burned and in ruin, but also sighted a band of Indians near the Falls. On signal, the cavalry charged. The Indians scattered to the north and west and escaped, save one man, who missed the unmarked trail crossing Covell's Slough and whose horse floundered in the mud near this spot. Soldiers fired and wounded him. Injured and on foot, he was killed by a mounted soldier's saber lashes. The cavalry reported the slain man to be Wa -keyan -doota, a nephew of the notorious renegade, Inkpaduta. The Indian killed was no t Inkpaduta's nephew. He was Makana Na Ota E 'En, which could be translated to Among Many Little Trees. He was a member of the visiting band who had no part in the Amidon murders or the sack of Sioux Falls. His only crime was being Indian. Later, his companions returned and buried him near the top of a nearby high point. Years later, in 1931, his true identity was related by his sister, Rattling Wings Woman. For some time, she unsuccessfully sought the burial place of her slain brother. It is thought that the unmarked grave of Makana Na Ota E 'En is in upper Terrace Park. Makana Na Ota E 'En, like the Amidons, was a tragic casualty in the eddies of violence surrounding the Dakota War.

Egan settled in Dakota in 1876. Egan was arrested, tried, convic ted and hanged for causing the death of his wife, Mary. She was murdered in September, 1880, on the family homestead farm 20 miles northwest of Sioux Falls, north of Hartford. She was found in the cellar of their sod home, dead from a bloody beating. The suspicion of neighbors, which promptly spread through the community, centered on Egan. He was immediately taken into custody and placed in jail in Sioux Falls where he remained until the hanging. Many years later, a surprising revelation would prove his complete innocence. Mary Hayden Lyons was a widow with a five year old daughter, Catherine, when she married Egan, in 1866, at Madison, Wisconsin. When the couple later moved, Catherine remained behind with relatives. Three sons, Sylvester, John and T ommy, were born to Thomas and Mary Egan before Catherine rejoined the household in Dakota Territory. Soon thereafter, on November 23, 1879, Catherine married a neighbor, James Van Horn. During the trial, James and Catherine Van Horn testified for the pro secution, a fact which angered Egan greatly. When the day of sentencing arrived, Territorial Judge Jefferson P. Kidder asked Egan if he had anything to say. With an angry scowl he replied 'Judge, I have nothing against anybody in the Court, or anybody a round the country, except the Van Horns. They betrayed me and may the curse of God be upon them. I can stand it, Sir. The law may not reach the Van Horns, but the curse of God will.' Catherine Van Horn lived 45 years with the words of her stepfather rin ging in her ears. On June 3, 1927, on her death bed, at age 65, in Seattle, Washington, she confessed that she had killed her mother. She wrote, 'Back in South Dakota in the early '80's I killed my mother. We quarreled and I hit her again and again over the head until she died. No one ever suspected me. My stepfather, Thomas Egan, was hung for the crime. He died vowing his innocence.' It took three drops from the hangman's trap door on July 13, 1882, to end the life of Thomas Egan. On the first drop, the rope broke and Egan was carried back to the platform. On the second drop, a deputy inadvertently broke Egan's fall and the hanging man was dragged to stand on the trap door a third time. Following the third drop, the official physician declared him dead.

The region East of the Big Sioux was ced ed by the Santee Sioux in 1851 that to the west by the Yankton Sioux in 1858. A breastwork was made at Oakwood Lakes in 1859 and occupied again in 1862 -63. In 1857 Nobles Wagon Road was built through the county, crossing the Big Sioux over an improved fo rd. A settlement, Medary, existed there 1857 -58 when the Sioux forced its abandonment. Permanent settlement was begun nearby in 1869 by 10 Norwegians with Medary the county seat 1871 -79. Another such colony of 31 settled at Lake Hendricks in July 1873. Population increased rapidly after 1877, numbering 4,965 in 1880, and 10,132 in 1890. Brookings County was created in 1862 and named for Wilmont W. Brookings (1830 -1905), prominent pioneer judge and legislator. Until 1873 it included parts of Moody, La ke and Kingsbury Counties. It was organized on July 3rd, 1871 in Martin N. Trygstand's cabin, 4 miles NW of Medary. Most towns began in 1879 when the Northwestern R.R. crossed the county, and others when roads pushed North in 1884.

In a skirmish several of the renegades were killed by Agency Indians near Lake Thompson. In 1857 Nobles Trail was built west passing south of this lake. 157 The Yankton Sioux ceded the region to the government in 1859. It wa s part of huge Buffalo County, 1864, and of larger Hanson County in 1870. On Jan. 8, 1873 it became Kingsbury County, named for George W.

Charles A. Lindbergh was the first to fly non -stop from New York to Paris. The 33\u00bd hour solo flight on May 20 -21, 1927, in a single engine monoplane, was a phenomenal aeronautical achievement which fascinated the world. Lindbergh's aircraft, the 'Spirit of St. Louis', was flown without a radio and only minimal navigational equipment, but with courage and skill. The Guggenheim Fund and the U.S. Department of Commerce sponsored Lindbergh in a nation - wide air tour to stimulate interest in commercial aviation and to demonstrate the safety and punctuality of professional flying. On August 27, 192 7, Lindbergh took off from Fargo, ND, for Sioux Falls. En route, he dropped fly -over messages when circling Aberdeen, Redfield, Huron and Mitchell. He landed here at Renner Field precisely at 12:00 o'clock noon as scheduled. The cheers of over 30,000 p ersons 'mounted into a steady roar' as the sleek, silvery plane landed and taxied to a stop. Col. Lindbergh concluded a brief address by expressing his hope 'that this little field or one that may be better situated, will be developed into a first class a irport for your city.' The expressed hope was fulfilled four months later by the founding of Dakota Airlines at this site on December 27, 1927. In the mid -1920s a prominent Sioux Falls aviator and former U.S. Army pilot, Harold W. Tennant, began providin g flight instruction and air taxi service on a 118 acre field, owned by George Renner, one -quarter mile southwest of here. The first full -scale flight facility for Sioux Falls, Dakota Airlines, was established here on December 27, 1927. Nellie Wilhite, So uth Dakota's first licensed aviatrix, received flight instruction and soloed at this field. While test -flying a new Kari -Keen monoplain, Tennant and a companion died in a tragic crash nearby on September 8, 1928. Dakota Airlines was dissolved February 2, 1931, when Renner Air Service was established. By then the airport included two large hangars, which faced west parallel to the railroad tracks, a small hangar with an office at the north entrance, a Standard Oil gasoline pump with a 1,000 gallon tank, a prominent wind sock and designated landing areas maintained for year -round flying. Several open cockpit biplanes were used for flight instruction and a five -passenger Ryan monoplane provided transport service. Air shows and airplane races were staged per iodically at the field. Flight operations were discontinued here in January of 1935.

The Me nnonites settled mainly in Hutchinson, Turner and Bon Homme counties. The Mennonites and Hutterian Brethren have their origin in the Anabaptist wing of the Reformation which started in central Europe. Their belief in separation of church and state and in nonresistance led to severe persecution for some three centuries. Hounded from country to country in Europe, God's providence finally led them to America for asylum. The first years of severe winters, grasshoppers, prairie fires and drought threatened the ir survival. However, hard work, an unwavering faith in God and financial aid from Mennonite Organizations carried them through these critical years. To commemorate the hardships they endured, the sacrifices they made and the rich heritage they left for u s, we dedicate this monument.

They draw strength from the winds that blow across the ir plains and they draw warmth from the sun that melts the snow or beats mercilessly on the parched earth of summer. They are gentle as the snow that falls and as determined as the blizzard that drives all before it. Prairie people are as refreshing as the early rains of summer and as honest and open as the plains that stretch for endless miles. They endure like the timeless mountains that rim the prairie's edge. Their lives sing like the meadowlark in spring and bring fragrance and beauty like the wil d roses that fill the valleys or the buttercups and crocuses that dot the hillsides. They are curious and free like the coyote that howls at dusk or the antelope that bounds across the hills. The people of the prairies are like the land they love...As Eva K. Anglesburg wrote in 'The Prairies Own': 'For where a land lies level, as far as the eye can see; Where nature's moods are so diverse, Where so tremendous is the spanning sky, That one seems centering the universe, It is not strange the prairie's sons have grown, To be like her, have virtues like her own.'\" Erected : 1978 by Farmers State Bank, Faith, SD Location : Meade County, US 212 between Faith & Maurine (1988) #635 The Town Clock \"Town Clock History 1887 -1987 165 This tower was constructed in 1887 to house the old town clock.

Welcome to our State.\" Erected : Location : Roberts County, SD Highway 10 at county line #654 Flint Store and Post Office \"The Flint store and post office was built o n this site in 1895. It was named after Moses E. Flint, an early homesteader. Mr. Flint served as a teamster with General Custer on the 1876 campaign against the Sioux which ended with the Battle of the Little Big Horn. Flint was located on a mail route from the old river town of LaGrace (Campbell County Seat from 1884 -1888) to Mound City (the present Campbell County Seat). Mail was carried on horseback twice weekly. The store also served as a school classroom. The store was built by the five Parrot br others and operated by their mother Mrs. Sara Parrot. The Parrot family moved to the area in 1884 and established homesteads on both sides of the present state border. In 1901 the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Saint Marie Railroad, commonly known as the Soo Line, built a branch into Campbell County from a junction with their main line at Wishek, North Dakota. Rather than building to existing settlements, the Soo Line established Artas, Herried, and Pollock along the Spring Creek Valley. Pollock was na med after R.Y. Pollock, a prominent and well respected homesteader. 172 Residents in the settlements around the new town of Pollock realized that without rail service they would not thrive. Citizens of LaGrace and Vanderbilt began a mass migration to Pollock as soon as the rail line was completed. The Flint store was moved to Pollock and served as its first post office. In the 1950s it was the town of Pollock itself which had to be moved. The town's original location was approximately 1\u00bd mile west of this ma rker. The construction of flood control dams on the Missouri River created Lake Pocasse which now covers the original town site. Beginning in 1955, Pollock started its move to the new location on a hill above the water line. The move was completed in 19 60 just prior to the creation of Lake Pocasse.\" Erected : 1995 Location : Campbell County, SD 10 east of Pollock just over the bridge that separates the two lakes, on left hand side (2006) #655 John Thompson Pioneer \"John Thompson arrived in America in 1854. He was 13 -year-old orphan who had lost his parents and sister to cholera during the long journey from Meraker, Norway. He was raised by an aunt in Wisconsin. After serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, he moved to Minnesota to live. There he met and married Kirsti Haugen. In June of 1866, the Thompsons and their friends Jonas and Anne Nelson set out in two ox - drawn covered wagons for Dakota Territory. The courageous travelers arrived June 29 at Fort Dakota located near the Bi g Sioux River in what is now downtown Sioux Falls. Learning that is it was unlawful to homestead within the 70 -square -mile military reservation surrounding the Fort, they continued on their trek north along the river. The Thompsons settled in what is now Sverdrup Township and by fall of that year had constructed a secure 12 -foot by 16 -foot sod house. The pair became the first permanent settlers in Minnehaha County and their daughter Berthine, born May 26, 1867, was the first white child to be born in the county. John Thompson played a very prominent role in public affairs. The Nidaros Lutheran Congregation was founded in his home on August 12, 1868. He served as a county commissioner, superintendent of schools, Sverdrup Township board supervisor, asse ssor, justice of the peace, and three sessions as a Dakota Territory legislator. In a rugged era when there were 'Giants in the Earth,' John Thompson earned the respect and admiration of his fellow Dakotans. Early Settlers' Association In 1892 group of pioneers with a sense of history began to organize an Early Settler's Association. Beginning with the fourth annual picnic in 1895 and for many years thereafter, Thompson's Grove on the west bank of the winding Big Sioux River was the site for the celebra tions. John Thompson was the owner of the heavily -wooded, shady, and picturesque area located about three quarters of a mile south of this marker. Each year banks and stores in the surrounding communities closed so that employees might attend the picnics. The Milwaukee Railroad ran special trains from Sioux Falls to Dell Rapid to the Grove. They were 'filled to capacity' with celebrants. Over the years the crowds increased, and by 1902 over 12,000 persons were on hand to socialize and visit with the pio neers in Minnehaha County. Entertainment varied from year to year. The picnickers were reminded by orators of the hardships faced by early settlers of Dakota Territory. They listened to military bands and danced to music provided by local orchestras. Sports competition included sack races, baseball, greased 173 pole climbing, bicycle races, swimming, horse races, tug -of-war contests and comical tub races in the river. The last picnic was held at Elmwood Park in Sioux Falls in 1939, but the 'Old Settlers' P icnic,' as it was fondly called, has not been forgotten. Thompson's Grove will long be remembered for the pioneers who gathered there to share their experiences and to celebrate their life in early Dakota Territory.\" Erected : 1995 Location : Minnehaha Co unty, north on Hwy 115, turn west on county highway 122 at the Midway store, to the entrance to Pioneer cemetery (Or 254th St. and Scancia) (2006) #656 Government Building In 1891, the Unites States Government purchased the southeast corner lot on Phillip s Avenue and 12th Street for $8,000 for the construction of a government building. While everyone agreed that the fledgling city of Sioux Falls needed such a building, the site selected came about after a bitter fight among competing businessmen. A group of men led by two of the very earliest settlers of Sioux Falls, Wilmot W. Brookings and John McClellan, wanted the building located on the 'north end' of Phillips Avenue. They all had economic interests in that area and wanted to enhance the value of thei r property. A second group, led by South Dakota Senator R.F. Pettigrew, was interested in developing their property at the 'south end' of Phillips Avenue. Each group offered incentives to the federal government. Senator Pettigrew introduced a bill in Con gress to provide funds for the project. While waiting for the outcome, he and his syndicate improved South Phillips Avenue and gathered signatures from people who favored their site. Congress passed the bill, and after due consideration, the Secretary of Treasury chose Phillips Avenue and 12th Street for the new public building. This aroused a protest from the 'north end' crowd, and the site location was again debated in Washington, D.C. However, the Secretary's decision prevailed, and construction on t his site began in 1892. Pettigrew was determined that the building be constructed of Sioux quartzite in support of the local quarry industry. Two of his associates were awarded contracts. Jacob Schaetzel, the first mayor of Sioux Falls (1883 -1885), did the excavating, and C.W. Hubbard of the Sioux Falls Granite Company erected the building with stone obtained from the Jasper Stone Company quarry. The renowned Wallace Dow was the supervising architect. Although not everyone was satisfied with the site, all agreed that Pettigrew's efforts brought an important project to Sioux Falls. It provided jobs for a number of men during the depression which followed the financial 'Panic of 1893' and also gave the citizens of the community a greater sense of stabil ity and permanence. The two -story building was completed at a cost of $152,000 and was opened to the public on May 17, 1895. The exterior with its simple materials, large massing, and great rounded arches shows the influence of the Richardsonian -Romanes que architectural style, so popular in the 1890s. The interior housed a post office on the first floor and a federal courtroom on the second floor. A third story was added in 1911, and in 1931 a two -story wing was added to the east side of the building. The post office moved to a new facility in 1968. This handsome stone building is one of Sioux Falls' finest examples of the stone cutters' art and of local building practices of the late nineteenth century.

Ecker\" 174 Erected : 1995 Location : Minnehaha County, 400 Phillips Ave. - Front of Courthouse (2006) #657 The \"Squatter\" Government at S ioux Falls City \"Originally part of Minnesota Territory, Sioux Falls City was founded during a time of widespread townsite speculation on the frontier. In 1856 members of the Western Townsite Company of Dubuque, Iowa, arrived at the Falls of the Big Sioux River and staked their claim under federal law. The following year, members of the Dakota Land Company from St. Paul, Minnesota, claimed adjacent land. Much of what is now downtown Sioux Falls was claimed by the two companies. In 1857 the Minnesota Terr itorial Legislature created Big Sioux County designating Sioux Falls City the county seat, and the business of government proceeded alongside the affairs of the promoters. All went fairly well until May 11, 1858, when Minnesota was admitted to the Union, leaving Sioux Falls City outside its boundaries and beyond the pale of law and order. The settlers believed a new territory, popularly known as Dakota, or Dacotah, would be created by Congress forthwith. They wanted the capital located in Sioux Falls City and key government jobs for themselves. Toward that end, a member of the Dakota Land Company was sent to Washington D.C., to act as a delegate to Congress. A printing press was hauled in from St. Paul and a newspaper, the Dakota Democrat, was establishe d. Next, they issued a call for a 'massive convention' to be followed by a general election. Some settlers argued that law and order was urgently needed to prevent Dakota from becoming the domain of outlaws. An election was held and on October 12, 1858, a 'squatter' legislature convened. A code of laws was adopted, and a number of other bills were considered by the 'squatter' legislators, acting with utmost dignity in a frontier setting. Legislation was subsequently introduced in Congress to create 'Da cotah Territory.' A House bill established Sioux Falls City as the temporary capital and legalized the work of the 'squatter' legislature. Unfortunately, however, it failed to pass, leaving the handful of Dakotans in legal limbo. Undaunted, the sturdy pioneers held another convention at the 'Dakota House', near the site of this marker, followed by an election on September 12, 1859. Voters again elected a delegate to Congress, a governor and a legislature. Like their predecessors, the new 'squat ter' legislature worked with dedication and spirit. Once again, however, their efforts were premature. Congress was grappling with the thorny problems of slavery and states rights, and largely ignored the ambitions of Dakotans. At long last, on March 2, 1861, Dakota Territory was created by Congress and the settlers were 'squatters' no more. Erected in 1994 by the Minnehaha County and South Dakota State Historical Societies, Minnehaha Century Fund and Mary Chilton DAR and Sioux Falls Area Foundations\" Erected : 1994 Location : Minnehaha County, East 9th street east of Phillips Ave. -First National Bank in Sioux Falls (2006) #658 The City Of East Sioux Falls \"From 1887 to about 1913, this area, bordering the Big Sioux River, was the thriving community of East Sioux Falls. The city boasted a hotel, several boarding houses, saloons and retail stores, a town hall, a cricket team, at least three church congregations, many modest homes and a 175 population of almost 600. Founded by C.W. Hubbard, the city was fir st called Ives. It was a company town set up to quarry the great deposits of Sioux quartzite and to cut the stone into paving and building blocks. When the post office was established in 1888, Ives was renamed East Sioux Falls. The new name may have sou nded more suburban to those courting eastern investors. The city prospered. Large quantities of stone were shipped by the Illinois Central Railroad to Detroit, St. Louis, Chicago and other distant cities. Sioux Falls and other area communities also used the stone in many magnificent examples of 19th century architecture. The industry attracted Welsh, English and Scottish stonecutters and their families. Their number soon outgrew the housing provided by the company. Many moved to Sioux Falls and Rowena , as East Sioux Falls bore a striking resemblance to a mining boomtown. Unlike its quiet, sedate neighbors, East Sioux Falls had a bawdy, wide -open appearance, where drinking, fighting and carousing were more than occasional diversions. The work of the st onecutters was highly skilled but dangerous, for they risked contracting a lung ailment from breathing the fine 'Jasper dust,' a residue of the cutting process. Many cutters died young or were severely disabled by the 'stonecutters' consumption.' In the s ummer of 1890 South Dakota's first electric railway, the South Dakota Rapid Transit and Railway Company, made its maiden run between Sioux Falls and East Sioux Falls. The electric line carried cutters to and from the quarries, while others took the 'troll ey' out to East Sioux Falls on weekends and holidays for picnics in the wooded park along the river, or just for the fun of the ride. On July 4, 1892, 3,500 revelers flocked to the park to be entertained by bands, songs, skits and sports. The financial 'P anic of 1893' and growing competition from other materials led to decreased demand for the more elegant, and more costly, quartzite. By 1910, the quarries were producing only a small amount of crushed rock for concrete making. In 1913, the town governmen t self - dissolved. By the 1950s, a store was the only business left, and in 1991 the remaining houses, empty shells, were razed. Once vibrant, now silent, all that remains are some railway spurs, empty quarries, the base for a crusher, stone foundations a nd the past.

Pettigrew (1848 -1926) \"Richard Franklin Pettigrew was 20 years old in the spring of 1869 when he first came to Dakota Territory from Wisconsin as a mem ber of a government surveying party. Pettigrew decided to settle in Sioux Falls and join in the building of the city. With money made from surveying and with his unusual leadership abilities, Pettigrew quickly rose to prominence. He was elected to the Territorial House of Representatives in 1872. He was, however, unseated after a bitterly fought contest. In 1876 he was elected to the Council, the upper chamber of the legislature, and was easily re -elected in 1878. As a legislator, Pettigrew zealously promoted the interests of his district. Because of his aggressive style and tall, thin stature, he became known as the 'Pickerel Statesman'. R.F. 'Frank' Pettigrew worked hard to bring railroads to Sioux Falls. He was a key figure in the building of the Queen Bee Mill completed in 1881, as well as many other industrial developments. In 1880, Pettigrew was elected Delegate to Congress where he promoted division of the Dakota Territory and statehood for southern Dakota. Upon admission of S outh Dakota to the Union in 1889, Pettigrew was elected to the United States Senate. Among his achievements in the Senate was legislation which created the national forest preserves. Because he believed in the worth of the individual over the corporation, he fought for a tariff which benefitted farmers and working people. He was re -elected to a second term in 1895. In 1896 Pettigrew shocked America when he bolted the Republican national convention as an act of protest over the money controversy. He fough t for 'free silver' and opposed the gold standard, again the champion of the common man over big business. This led him into Populism, and Pettigrew became one of the leaders of the People's Party. In 1899, in response to American aggression in the Phil ippine Islands, Pettigrew raised his voice in the Senate against imperialism, instead supporting the ideals of national self -determination. Although he lost his Senate seat as a result of this fight, he emerged as one of the great American statesmen of hi s time. In an era when politicians were thought of as celebrities, his name became a household word. After he left office, Pettigrew remained active in political and intellectual circles. In 1917, he was indicted under the Espionage Act for his oppositio n to America's involvement in World War I. After the charges were dismissed, he authored two books based upon his experience in public office. In 1923, he built an addition on to his home to house his large collection of frontier artifacts. It was here that he died in 1926. He bequeathed his home and valuable collection to the city of Sioux Falls. The Pettigrew Home and Museum was opened to the public on January 1, 1930.

The school's purpose was 'to educate young men for 177 the holy ministry in the Lutheran Church...(and) to prepare men for the profession o f teaching.' The school moved many times before settling in Canton. Attracted by a generous land offer from the Illinois Central Railroad Augustana moved to Paxton, Illinois in 1863, then to Marshall, Wisconsin in 1869. Encouraged by the westward migrat ion of many Norwegians during the Dakota boom the school moved 400 miles from Marshall to northwest Iowa at Beloit in 1881. Augustana settled in Canton in 1890 due to growing enrollment and the offer of a three -story building from the citizens. The semin ary remained in Beloit until 1890. In 1917 the newly formed Norwegian Lutheran Church in America voted to merge Augustana College and the Lutheran Normal School in Sioux Falls and to close the Canton campus. In 1919 the Church re -opened the institution at Canton with the name of Canton Lutheran Normal School, which later became Augustana Academy and operated as a high school of the Lutheran Church. The Augustana Academy Association was formed in 1932 and assumed control of the school until its closing i n 1971. The Old Main building of the Academy is an excellent example of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture with its massive scale, rough cut granite, and arched openings. Designed by Omeyer and Thori of St. Paul it is a four -story building, 104 feet long and 60 feet wide. Havig received pledges totaling $10,000 from Augustana College Association members and $5,000 from the synod of the United Norwegian Lutheran Church, ground was broken in the late summer of 1901. Actual construction was begun the ne xt year and the building was dedicated on October 4, 1903. This was the second building on the campus. The original Old Main housed classrooms, offices, 25 dormitory rooms, a gymnasium, and a chapel that would seat about 500 people. Total cost of the st ructure, with furnishings, was $48,492.99.

Soo Line officials requested the town be named Pollock i n honor of R.Y. Pollock, a pioneer lay minister and respected citizen of the area. With passage of the Flood Control Act of 1944, citizens of Pollock realized the construction of Oahe Dam would inundate their town of less than 500 people. Instrumental in bolstering public support through his local newspaper, E.L. MacKay reported the unanimous vote in favor of keeping the town together at a January 27, 1953 public meeting. A vote was then taken to determine which direction the town should move from its soo n to be flooded location. The vote was west -2, north -20, east -39, and south -139. The Flood Association's recommendation was to move the town south and in the next round of voting, 167 voted for the southern location. A unanimous vote was then cast for t he southern site for new Pollock. In 1956, the Corps of Engineers agreed to make the north crossing into a dam, thereby creating a small lake that would not fluctuate with the rise and fall of Lake Oahe. This dam created Lake Pocasse under which the old town site of Pollock now rests. By the spring of 1962, the people of Pollock were completely moved, the old town was leveled, and Lake Pocasse was nearly full. Lot Distribution In New Pollock 178 Community leaders, John B. Pollock, I.H. and Robert Pollock formed the nonprofit Pollock Development Corporation to acquire the site one mile south of old Pollock and subdivided the land. After much discussion, the committee settled on a method for dis tributing both residential and business lots in the new townsite. The entire community studied the plat of the new town, looked over the land itself, consulted their relatives and friends, and selected their choice of a lot. They sealed the lot number of their choice in an envelope and placed them in a box. On May 26, 1955, envelopes were drawn, one by one, and names posted on the appropriate lots on a map of the new town. There appeared to be no duplicate choices, and in the end there were only a few c ases where two people had drawn the same lot. Ties were settled by the toss of a coin. A period of trading followed among those who wished to have different neighbors. Lake Pocasse A contest was held to name the new lake. In August of 1961 Wilmer Kirsch enmann submitted the name of Pocasse, an Arikara Indian chief whom Lewis and Clark met in the area in 1804.

They knew the curative value of the warm springs located there and used them for bathing their sick and lame. Exploration of the area by white men in 1874 -75 led to settlement and the discovery of 75 geothermal springs. The crystal clear water issues from clefts in rocks or bubbles up out of the ground. Bathhouses, swimming plunges, hotels, hospitals and sanitariums were built tu rning the City of Hot Springs into an early national health resort.

They organized Sioux Falls Hospital located in the Seney House on the northeast corner of Fourth Street and Menlo Avenue. It was the only hospital in Sioux Falls for several years. At that time hospitals were considered a place one went to die. For this reason the first patient to enter Sioux Fal ls Hospital pleaded to be taken instead to the facilities at the State Penitentiary! The Hospital moved to the Cameron House at the northwest corner of Tenth Street and Dakota Avenue in 1896. Soon it added the first formal nursing program in South Dakota , the Sioux Falls Training School for Nurses. This school, which became the Sioux Valley Hospital School of Nursing, closed in 1986, 2120 graduates later. 179 A larger building was soon needed. Land was purchased on the northwest corner of 19th Street and Minnesota Avenue and a frame two story 20 bed hospital was constructed 1900. This first building in South Dakota to be built specifically as a hospital was named Sioux Falls Lutheran Hospital. After several successful years, two unforeseen events placed heavy financial and physical burdens upon the new hospital. During World War I, medicines and supplies of many of which were diverted for the war effort, became extremely costly and in short supply. Secondly, the deadly Spanish Influenza of 1918 brought s cores of flu victims to the hospital making it necessary to put patients in the corridors, in offices, and even in the parlor. Many of these flu victims were also unable to pay for their hospital services. The hospital successfully weathered the crisis a nd later merged with Moe Hospital in 1925. Shortly thereafter the name was changed to Sioux Valley Hospital which became known from then on as a community hospital. A drive began in 1927 to raise funds to build a much larger new hospital building. A bo oklet entitled 'An Institution of Organized Kindness' was distributed which explained the need for a new modern facility. Construction began in March of 1929 in the middle of a corn field at the outer edge of Sioux Falls at what is now 18th Street and Euc lid Avenue. The stock market crash in October and the depression which followed stalled progress on the building. With generous community support, however, it was completed and opened in 1930 In 1994, 100 years after its modest beginning, Sioux Valley Ho spital was named one of America's 100 best -performing general acute care hospitals. It continues today as 'An Institution of Organized Kindness.'\" Erected : 1995 Location : Minnehaha County, 18th Street and Euclid Avenue, Sioux Falls (2006) #665 Eminija, Minnesota Territory \"In May of 1857, land speculators from the Dakota Land Company, of St. Paul, Minnesota Territory, surveyed and located the town site of Eminija in this immediate area. Eminija was the Santee Sioux Indian name for the Split Rock River which flows at the base of the hill to the east. The site covered 640 acres, including the junctions of Beaver Creek, the Split Rock and Big Sioux Rivers, all south of this point. Eminija was declared to be 'the county seat of Vermillion County...on the Si oux River, 13 miles below the Falls and at the more practical head of navigation for large steamers...' Imaginative reports by land promoters published in the Minnesota press from 1857 through 1861 extolled the virtues of this area: 'groves of beautiful timb er line the river...richer soil cannot be found anywhere...fields of corn and potatoes I have not seen excelled...forests of wild pomegranate, grapes, currants grow in luxuriant abundance...there is a small class of steamers plying the Sioux as high as Eminija...two steam boats are already in the Sioux River trade, from Sioux City to Eminija...there are saw mills running night and day, yet not half the demand can be met...' Other town sites along the Big Sioux River surveyed by the Dakota Land Company included Medary, Fl andreau and Sioux Falls City. The recorded plat for Eminija, filed in a Minnesota Territory land office, has never been found. The only known reference to the location of the Eminija town site appears in the field notes of Alfred J. Hill, a prominent ar chaeologist, civil engineer and geographer. He visited this site in 1860, to describe and map it as part of a regional study of Indian mound sites. Hill was guided by Byron M. Smith, the surveyor of the Dakota Land Company who had defined the boundary 180 line three years earlier. Concerning the site boundaries of Eminija, Hill stated that the north line passed through the largest of the ancient Indian mounds visible to the west. Dakota Land Company employees built a log cabin on the Eminija town site about 250 yards to the southeast of this spot. Early maps of the area show Eminija located at the juncture of the Split Rock and the Big Sioux Rivers. Several of these maps show stagecoach and wagon roads leading from Eminija to Sioux Falls City, to New Ulm an d Blue Earth and following the Big Sioux River south to Sioux City. There was a stage stop at Eminija, but it and other enterprises were short lived. The nation was embroiled in the Civil War; the Sioux War of 1862 brought chaos to the Sioux Valley; and a national election, politically unfavorable to the Company, resulted in its collapse. Eminija became a casualty of rapid and turbulent change on the Dakota frontier.

Thousands turned out for 'Roosevelt Day' to see and hear the 41 -year-old governor of New York, who was running for the vice -preside ncy on a ticket with the incumbent Republican president, William McKinley, of Ohio. South Dakotans generally knew Roosevelt as a wealthy easterner who enjoyed frequent and extended retreats to the rugged western frontier. Little Missouri, near Medora, D akota Territory, was the site of a ranch house which he built, largely with his own hands. He had received recognition and honors for his leadership in the Spanish -American War where he led a regiment of volunteers, the Rough Riders, in a charge against a n enemy stronghold on San Juan Hill in Cuba. Many also admired his efforts to enact political and social reforms while he served in both appointed and elected posts. Roosevelt's visit to Sioux Falls occurred during his national campaign tour. In all, he barnstormed through 567 communities in 24 states, made 673 speeches to more than 3,000,000 people. The candidate and a small troupe of Midwestern office -holders made 27 whistlestops in South Dakota between September 11 and 14. Sioux Falls was the fourth stop of the campaign train in the state. Many local dignitaries participated in the celebration with O.L. Sues serving as Marshall for the day. In Roosevelt's entourage was Colonel Melvin Grigsby of Sioux Falls, a prominent Civil War veteran, one -time Att orney General of South Dakota, and commander of Grigsby's Cowboys, another unit commissioned for the war with Spain. Despite a stormy day, people from the city and the surrounding countryside lined the streets before 10:00 A.M. to shout 'Teddy' as he rode in a horse drawn carriage from the Milwaukee Depot at Fifth Street and Phillips Avenue to the speakers' stand. Steam whistles blew, storefronts bore patriotic decorations, and banners stretched from one lamppost to another. Stalwart supporters wore butto ns, and bands paraded along with hundreds attired in khaki Rough Rider costumes. Stiff chilling winds forced Roosevelt into nearby City Auditorium for his 30 -minute speech to an overflowing house, but then he returned to the outdoor platform for a few rous ing words to the 181 cheering crowd. He declared, 'You have got to have courage, honesty, and good sense, and you have got to have them on the part of the nation just as much as on the part of an individual.' In the November general election, the team of McKi nely and Roosevelt won 57 percent of the 96,000 votes cast by South Dakotans.

Meredith, first president of the University of Sioux Falls, platted a future residential community within the northwest boundary of early Sioux Falls. His purpo se was to raise funds through land sales for the struggling school. The area quickly became known as West Sioux Falls. The intersection of present day Burnside and Madison Streets and Lincoln Avenue was its focal point. Prior to 1900, the growing commu nity included several modest homes and farm buildings, Beulah Baptist Church, Meredith School, Edson Grocery and wooded Meredith Park. The earliest residents hauled water from a small shallow well next to the grocery store which was soon replaced by a lar ger community well located at the northwest corner of Bailey Street and Garfield Avenue. Industrial and agricultural businesses were established west of the Big Sioux River. Despite the economic hard times which followed the Panic of 1893 and which exist ed into the new century, the community continued to grow. Following World War I, the surrounding flat grassy fields served as makeshift landing sites for barnstorming aviators. Thrilling air shows included stunt flying, wing -walking, parachute jumps, an d aerial acrobatics. In 1920 a 40 acre West Soo Amusement Park was opened in the former Meredith Park. The up -and-coming Lawrence Welk Orchestra and other musical groups regularly played for public dances held in the dance pavilion. A spectacular displa y of fireworks each Fourth of July, ball diamonds and regularly scheduled semi -pro baseball games, a shaded picnic area and fishing and swimming in the Big Sioux River drew large crowds to the park. Scenic Elmwood Park was established in 1924. It extende d north of the residential community and is now an integral part of the 18 -hole Elmwood Municipal Golf Course. For many years, an impressive collection of mounted wild animals was displayed at West Sioux Hardware. The trophies were collected by Henry Br ockhouse, a longtime community businessman and resident and an avid sportsman. His safari hunting expeditions covered a period of 35 years and spanned four continents. Generally regarded as the largest private collection in the world, it was sold in 1985 and became a major attraction of the Delbridge Museum of Natural History at the Sioux Falls Great Plains Zoo. Beulah Baptist Church, more than a century old, together with several early homes, and the florist greenhouse remain at their original location s.

In June 1912, a Curtis Pusher biplane was the first airplane to enter the skies over the city. It was delivered by railroad car and reassembled before flight. While World War I gave exposure to the airplane, aircraft were generally a rarity until returning army aviators flying surplus military training airplanes, created images of the daredevil stunt pilot and the 'flying circus.' Foremost among the local flying adventurers was Lt. Harold W. Tennant. In addition to perform ing at scores of air shows, he played a leading role in advancing aviation in this area. During this barnstorming era, Congress enacted the Air Mail Act of 1925. Realizing the potential impact of being located on an airmail route, community leaders forme d the Sioux Falls Airport Holding Company. It purchased farm land located south of 41st Street which it leased to the city for an airport. To operate the airport, the city contracted with Soo Skyways Airport Company which was formed by a group of local businessmen that included Rush A. Brown, C.H. Peck, John Morrell Foster, and Knapp Brown. Three grass runways soon traversed Soo Skyways Airport. Two runways made a large 'X' between Western and Kiwanis Avenues, and a third east -west runway was situated near present 49th Street. Facilities at the airport grew to include six hangars, administration, repair and maintenance buildings, ad a sizeable fleet of airplanes for instruction and charter service. Soo Skyways Airport became a base for area barnstorme rs and served as the location for the Sioux Falls Air Races in 1929, 1930 and 1931. Competition included several classes of races and balloon busting, bombing and parachute jumping contests. The tower building at Columbus College, today part of the Royal C. Johnson Memorial Hospital, served as one of the pylons for the races. Joe Foss, a young Minnehaha County farm boy, first learned to fly at the airport in 1936. As a Marine fighter pilot, Foss went on to become a World War II 'ace.' He later became t he 30th governor of South Dakota. Hanford Tri -State and United Airlines were the first scheduled airlines to provide passenger service to Sioux Falls. The fare from Soo Skyways Airport to Sioux City, Iowa was $4.32. As the volume of mail and passengers g rew throughout the 1930s, the airlines began using larger and faster aircraft requiring longer runways and improved flight facilities. In 1939, to meet these demands, Sioux Falls municipal airport was established on the northwest edge of the city.

He acquired farm land in Mapleton Township. Years later, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad built a track across his property. In 1898 the unincorpo rated village of Renner was founded along the railroad right -of-way. While Renner was one of the last towns to be established in Minnehaha County, the first homesteaders in the area arrived in 1866. Jonas and Anne Nelson traveled here from Minnesota by oxen -drawn covered wagons with friends John and Kirsti Thompson. They stopped at Fort Dakota, located in what is now downtown Sioux Falls, and were informed that civilians could not settle within the military reservation. The northern boundary of the 70 -square -mile federal reservation was the same as the east -west County Highway 130 which bisects Renner today. Pushing on, the Nelsons claimed their homestead about two miles northwest of present day Renner. The area's first post office was established in the Nelson home with Jonas Nelson as postmaster. The site was named Republican on early maps of Dakota Territory. Renner quickly became the general trade center for inhabitants of Mapleton Township. A general store, Renner Mercantile, was located in a la rge two -story building which also included a barber shop, a pool hall, a post office, and a dance hall on the second floor. A grain elevator, a stockyard and a small passenger and freight depot were located near the railroad tracks. Later businesses incl uded a caf\u00e9, several trucking companies, a garage, a lumber yard, and the First State Bank of Renner. A mother and daughter bandit team held up the bank at gun point on November 27, 1925, and made off with several hundred dollars in bills and coins. Alth ough the robbers made a getaway, they were later arrested and prosecuted. Since 1899, baseball has been a major recreational activity in Renner. The local team was first called the Flyers and later the Monarchs. The village has hosted the South Dakota Amateur Baseball Tournament four times, and Renner teams have won seven state championships. The Renner Band was organized in 1921 and played concerts at the band shell in Renner Park and at the fairgrounds located northwest of this spot. The fairgrounds featured a grandstand and a one - half mile dirt track. Competing race car drivers attracted crowds of several thousand patrons.

She had been born Eliza Smith Tupper on October 8, 1844 in Houlton, Maine. As a young woman she was influenced by Quaker friends who encouraged her to study for the ministry and was ordained a Universalist minister on May 2, 1871. Eliza married a young Wisconsin lawyer, William A. Wilkes, and the couple eventually settled in Sioux Falls. Encouraged and supported by her husband in her work, she functioned for eight years as a mis sionary, working alone without direction or aid from any denomination. She corresponded with many, arranged study groups and classes, and traveled by horse and buggy covering the plains of southeastern Dakota Territory and western Minnesota. She conducte d services in many scattered communities. She was the first ordained woman minister to publicly preach in Dakota Territory. Usually speaking to a crowded hall, she was 'beloved for her faithfulness out of the pulpit as well as for her ability in it.' It was said that her modest, gentle demeanor was much admired by all women of that era. In the autumn of 1886, she helped organize the All Souls Church (Unitarian). She was a major force in the building of the original church at the southeast corner of Dak ota Avenue and 12th Street, which was dedicated on April 25, 1888. Pastor Wilkes managed a very full life, raising five sons and daughter. She and her husband, by then a Minnehaha County judge, built several homes in the North Summit and Prairie Avenues area, now a part of Cathedral Historical District. She was known as a gracious and busy mother and hostess. Her children often camped at 'Ford's Grove, west of town,' which is now lower Sherman Park. Eliza Tupper Wilkes also played a leadership role in civic affairs. She was active in the WCTU campaigns to control or abolish liquor. An early champion of woman's suffrage, she helped found the Ladies' History Club, which later became the Sioux Falls Woman's Club, formed in 1879, which donated the first $ 50 toward a book fund to establish the city's first library, and was appointed a committee of one to select and buy books. Widely recognized as an intellectual and cultural leader, she was 'one of the foremost workers' in the establishment of the Sioux Fa lls Public Library.

The first building, which became the ice house, was constructed by Luther and Anna Gage. The store bordered a section -line dirt trail used by horse dra wn wagons and buggies and an occasional automobile. A private highway association, active in promoting a tourist road from the East to Yellowstone National Park, included the unimproved trail as part of the route. The road was named the 'Custer Battlefie ld Highway.' 185 The State Highway Commission designated the trail as U.S. Highway 16 in 1926. Maintenance equipment was very primitive. After heavy rains, State crews used horse drawn drags to level ruts and washboards. Drainage culverts were installed in 1928, and the trail was graded and graveled for the first time. In 1931, concrete paving began. The first five mile stretch of the newly paved highway, running in both directions from the store now known as Pumpkin Center, was opened to public use in Jun e. When a pavement dance was held on the highway in front of the store to celebrate the event, the party was monitored by Federal G -men.

In time, as auto traffic increased, the small general store also became a gasoline filling station. During the 1930s, a new car dealership created a need for a repair garage and a body shop. Scheduled bust and freight service eventually became availa ble. Pumpkin Center was a gathering place to drink coffee and visit. It was also a landmark to meet and carpool, and more than once, it was a safe haven for winter travelers halted by deep snow or by a fierce, blinding blizzard. In the thirties, commun ity activities at Pumpkin Center included softball and baseball tournaments. The store sponsored its own team, the 'River Rats.' For many years picnic tables surrounding the small cluster of buildings hosted vacationers in the spring and summer and pheas ant hunters in the fall. During World War II the store provided a patriotic service as a Red Cross Station. The store, last of the related enterprises to close, finally locked its doors for good in 1993. The naming of Pumpkin Center is lost in uncertai nty. Whatever its origin, the name stuck and for decades the phrase, 'I'll meet you at Pumpkin Center,' was common. Among the last of the early way stops that accompanied the development of the automobile and the expansion of transportation, Pumpkin Cent er helped to define an era. It served its purpose and has gone on to join the early wagon camps and stage coach stations in the evolving history of Minnehaha County.

Brookings and members of the Western Town Company of Dubuque, Iowa in September 1857. In the previous year, they had staked out a 320 acre claim and established the town of Sioux Falls, Minnesota Territory, on the west side of the Big Sioux River. The new townsite was northwest of a large wooded island, originally called Brookings but later renamed Seney. Although Dubuque House was built for visitors and prospective settlers, it may have also served as a meeting hall, freight station and post office. It appears in the federal field notes and on the first map of Sioux Falls made by a federal surveyor in August, 1859, the only building shown within the townsite. The primitive hotel was built of rough undressed blocks of Sioux Quartzite, found in the stone outcroppings which surround the Falls of the Big Sioux River. No photography or sketches of the hotel are known to exist, but it was probably a roug h rectangular -shaped structure featuring a 186 single open room with a loft above and a cellar below. Sleeping accommodations were crude, with cloth sack mattresses filled with prairie grasses on rough wooden cots or on the floor, with animal skins and blanke ts for covers. Since the settlers had a steam -driven sawmill, we can assume that the roof was probably made of rough boards and light wooden poles covered with thatch and dirt, much like the settlers' cabins. Windows were small and covered with cloth or skins. Oil lamps provided any interior lighting. There probably was not an innkeeper in residence; whether visitors paid for sleeping space is uncertain. But the existence of the Dubuque House enabled the town promoters to assure the world that the new city did indeed have a new hotel! With the rest of the town, Dubuque House was abandoned in the Dakota War of 1862 and probably burned by the Santee Sioux. When Fort Dakota, D.T., was established in 1865 at what is now the northeast corner of Phillips Av enue and Eighth Steet, the Sioux Falls town site was included within the boundaries of the 70 square -mile military reservation surrounding the Fort. Not until Fort Dakota was closed in 1869 was the military reservation reopened for civilian settlement. T he remains of Dubuque House were razed and the stones were probably used to begin the construction of the Stevenson Hotel near the intersection of North Main Avenue and Falls Park Drive. Although that hotel's walls were erected, the building was never com pleted. However, in 1874 stone from the unfinished Stevenson Hotel was used nearby for the construction of the city's first brewery.

A prehistoric village site and numerous burial mounds are located nearby. Many early Brandon area settlers were of Norwegian descent; some staked claims before the town was even established. The first school in Brandon Township, which opened in 1873, was built of sod, with a dirt floor, tiny windows and wooden shipping box for a teacher's desk. The entire cost of the school was $9. The present city was founded by a railroad company to serve incoming settlers. Spikes for the new railroad in what was to become Brandon, Dakota Territory, were driven on July 15, 1878. Just two weeks later on August 1, amid a jubilant celebration, the first train steamed into the future town. The engine, decked with colorful flags and streamers, was greeted by a lar ge noisy, crowd. On September 18, 1878, the Worthington and Sioux Falls Railroad Company filed a plat containing eight blocks with 130 lots. Land overlooking the Big Sioux River, originally homestead by pioneers Gustave and Ida Florell, became the new to wn site. The railroad depot was the first building erected and a post office soon followed. The railroad company later said that the small village was named for Brandon, Vermont, a town burned by Indians in 1777. During its early years, Brandon grew sl owly but steadily. In 1883, members built the first church, Norwegian Lutheran, to join the grain elevator, two retail stores and a blacksmith shop that had already been constructed that year. Other early businesses included a creamery, which sold butter as far east as New York City, and a bank which has operated continuously since its founding in 1905. 187 Minnehaha County's first improved park, McHardy Park, was created at Brandon in 1972 through a gift of 36 acres by Bryson and Hazel McHardy. The wooded p ark lies in a picturesque valley of the Split Rock Creek on the southeast edge of town. East of the park, the normally peaceful Split Rock Creek, was the site of a local tragedy. Two families, including a teenaged girl and an infant, attempted to ford th e creek in July of 1879. The swift -moving current, swollen with summer rains, overturned their horse -drawn covered carriage, spilling six passengers into the rushing stream. Only the teenager and the infant's father escaped. In 1973, to manage its incr easing growth in population, Brandon became an incorporated city. Now in its second century of existence, it has become one of South Dakota's fastest growing communities. Brandon's history suggests a bright and promising future.

In memory of his late wife and in tribute to all women, he chose the school motto 'From Glory to Glory,' which was inscribed in the polished Sioux quartzite cornerstone. When Bishop Hare selected Sioux Falls as the site for the prop osed school, the community responded by raising $10,000 in money and land to establish it. This included a five acre tract on a hill at the south edge of town that was donated by Artemus Gale, a prominent local real estate agent. Other gifts of money cam e from women in the east, including $3,000 from the wife of John Jacob Astor, owner of the American Fur Trading Company. The original school building with its distinctive Venetian Gothic architecture was designed by Wallace L. Dow. It included the chapel , which was later embellished with stained Tiffany windows, as well as classrooms and living quarters for teachers, students, and Bishop Hare. Although the school opened in 1885 with 14 boys and girls in all grades, within a year 43 girls, both day and boa rding students, made Bishop Hare's vision of a girls' boarding school a reality. For almost half -a-century, sisters from the Peabody family in Minnesota provided leadership as principals and teachers of as many as 88 girls a year, from elementary grades t hrough high school. Girls in middy blouse and skirt or sweater and skirt uniforms were a familiar sight to Sioux Falls residents as they played on the school grounds, skated on the ice rink, or walked two - by-two to Cavalry Cathedral on Sundays. Eventuall y a gym enabled the girls to participate in basketball and volleyball. Field day in which classes competed with each other in athletic events was held yearly on Bishop Hare's birthday. The May Fete on the lawn, with a May Queen and a Maypole Dance in whi ch all students participated, were also memorable occasions. Bishop Hare believed that girls should be offered the same education available to boys, so laboratory science was part of the standard elementary and secondary curriculum. Music, art and foreign language study were also available to All Saints students. After World War II, good high schools were available to most South Dakota girls and the boarding school became too expensive to operate. In 1951, All Saints converted to a private elementary and nursery school. By 1986, financial problems made continuation of even this school impossible and the institution closed. In 1996, two years after the property was sold, the 188 first senior residents moved into the restored and converted original school buil ding and the new living units of the Waterford at All Saints retirement community.

Initially, twenty acres of land were purchased at a location east of town presumed to be far enough away so that it would not obstruct town growth. To defray cost of the land, thirty -two people purchased the first plots for $10 each. Prior to the establishment of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, burials were in the Fort Dakota military cemetery and in Sioux Falls City plots on the hi gh bluff west of town. This land came to be seen as better suited for building fine homes overlooking the town than for burials. Therefore, in 1880 the remains from these burials were moved to the Mount Pleasant and Fort Randall cemeteries. Over the yea rs, several substantial and timely gifts provided need improvements and helped to develop the cemetery. Inez Van Eps, wife of pioneer merchant, gave the Sioux quartzite gateposts at the entrance, and fifteen acres of land on the west side, which became kn own as Sunset Slope. Josephine Glidden, in honor of her deceased husband, a prominent business and civic leader, left a bequest of $13,000 to build a chapel and receiving vault. In 1924, the Glidden Memorial Chapel, built of quartzite, the hard pink ston e that underlies the city, was constructed near the cemetery entrance. The first funeral in the new chapel was that of Dennis McKinney, a pioneer banker and a family friend of the Gliddens, who had supervised the chapel's construction. Because of a very c old, harsh winter, McKinney's body was kept in the crypt of the chapel until spring when the frozen earth of the cemetery finally yielded to the shovel. During an especially long, severe winter in the 1930s, more than twenty -five bodies were held in the c rypt. More recent gifts include funds given by Raleigh and Minnie Nelson in 1990 for the Nelson Memorial Office and Maintenance Building and various organizations donated a monument honoring war veterans in 1995. Mount Pleasant Cemetery holds much of Sio ux Falls' history. Those interred include people from every walk of life including founders of the town, local legends, five volunteer firefighters 189 of the Cascade Hook and Ladder Company, children from South Dakota Children's Home, victims of accidents an d calamities occurring during the tumultuous years of Dakota Territory and over 700 veterans of all wars, including more than 180 Civil War veterans. Grave markers range from simple wooden tablets and native boulders to monuments costing thousands of dollars. The oldest marker, which was moved from the Sioux Falls City cemetery, is that of William Stevens, dated November 16, 1869. Much of early Sioux Falls lies at rest in tranquil Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

Iverson, his father Iver, brother Peter and brother -in-law Andy had no established roads to follow when they came to Dakota Territory in 1868. They had to wade or ford rivers and streams as best they could. These men, from near Decorah, Iowa, were the vanguard of settlers. As the first to arrive i n Split Rock Township, the Iversons were able to claim several choice homesteads along the Big Sioux River where they found timber, water power, abundant wildlife and rich soil. They were isolated and alone because there were no towns in the county in 186 8. Their nearest neighbors were the soldiers stationed at Fort Dakota near the Falls of the Big Sioux River. Nonetheless, with the resources at hand and their own strength and sense of purpose, the Iversons triumphed over the hardships and in time establ ished successful farms. In April 1871, settlers from Split Rock Township petitioned the Minnehaha County Commissioners asking that a road be created and extended west to a point called Iverson Crossing, named for Ole B. Iverson on the Big Sioux River. Fro m the early 1870s, until the county's first railroad arrived in Sioux Falls in the summer of 1878, this Iverson Crossing road served as the main artery of transportation for mail, freight, and passengers from Minnesota and Iowa to Sioux Falls. The stageco ach from Blue Earth, Minnesota to Sioux Falls and the stage from Sibley, Iowa, used this road and crossed the Big Sioux River at Iverson Crossing as did others and was frequently mentioned in Sioux Falls newspapers. This area was first known as Gibraltar , because of the numerous outcroppings of quartzite rock on the hillsides. In January of 1871 the Dakota Territory Legislature sent a memorial to Congress asking that a bridge be constructed over the Big Sioux River, 'at or near Gibraltar, near where the Sioux Falls and Blue Earth City road crosses the same.' Since Ole B. Iverson by that time was serving in the legislature, the memorial was likely a result of his influence. During certain times of the year, the river was dangerously high, overturning wag ons and stranding travelers. The Bridge was also deemed necessary for the many new settlers who were certain to move into the area. The first bridge on the road was constructed in 1889. Until then, a growing but uncounted stream of people took their cha nces fording the river at Iverson Crossing. We can only imagine, with a sense of curiosity and wonder, the procession of pioneers who passed by on horseback, or in stagecoaches, or in covered wagons on their way east or west. For most of them, this road, the crossing and the scenic countryside promised a better future.

The next spring, men joined them from the Dakota Land Company of St. Paul. To gether, they founded Sioux Falls City, Minnesota Territory. Both groups came in anticipation of a treaty with the Yankton Sioux Indians, which would cede most of the Big Sioux River valley to the federal government. Since the Sioux looked upon these peop le as trespassers, their hold on the town site was precarious from the outset. In the summer of 1858, the settlers received the alarming news that the town of Medary to the north had been destroyed by Indians. Sioux Falls City was thrown into a state of e xcitement. After some discussion, the settlers resolved to stay and defend their property. A fortification, made primarily of sod, was erected around a one -and-one-half story stone building owned by the Dakota Land Company. Called 'Fort Sod' by its buil ders, the earthen 'Alamo' stood near the site of this marker. The walls of Fort Sod were four feet thick and ten feet high and enclosed an area about eighty feet by eighty feet, which included a spring of good drinking water. A deep ditch surrounded the fort and small portholes for shooting were cut out of the sod walls. When it was finished, the entire population of Sioux Falls City, with their belongings, entered the sanctuary and waited. The lone woman of the group, Rebecca Goodwin, made a flag from flannel shirts and one of her skirts. In an act of sturdy defiance, the Stars and Stripes flew from the battlements. One of the besieged, James M. Allen, wrote a letter to his father, dated June 17, 1858. Allen reported that morale was high among the thi rty-five men and one woman, who were determined to stay and defend themselves and their property at the risk of their lives. They formed sentries and scouting parties, according to Allen, including Mrs. Goodwin, who could 'shoot a gun as well as anyone.' As they feared, Indians appeared at Sioux Falls City. After three days of cautiously and indecisively watching Fort Sod, they left. Not a shot was fired by either side. The settlers' anxieties were not allayed, however, and they maintained their vigilan ce. After living six weeks within and near the walls of Fort Sod, the makeshift garrison was low on provisions and 'poor in flesh and weak in spirits.' To their relief, two men with a buggy full of supplies arrived at the gates of the Fort. The siege wa s broken, and the gallant defenders marched out of Fort Sod, according to Allen, 'in battle array, rivaling Falstaff's army.' They had survived the incident at Fort Sod and, in the uneasy peace that followed, continued to build the new settlement.

A repository of their remains, along with other kinds of animals, lay undisturbed until their discovery over 26,000 years later, in June 1974. Limestone deposits beneath the earth's surface dissolved in water from underground springs. The land then collapsed and the resulting sinkhole filled with 95 degree water that lured mammoths to drink or feed on vegetation. Once in the water, they could not get up the slippery, 191 steep incline. Death by starvation or drowning was the fate of most animals that came to the sinkhole. Along with the mammoth, remains of the giant short -faced bear, extinct camel, gray wolf, raptor, cottontail rabbit, white -tailed j ackrabbit, white -tailed prairie dog, fish and other associated fauna have also been found at the Site. As centuries passed, the sinkhole gradually filled. Rain, snow and wind wore away the soil leaving a hill of buried skeletons. This hill remained undist urbed until 1974 when excavation for a housing project by Phil and Elenora Anderson revealed bones and tusks of these huge animals. In 1975, the Mammoth Site of Hot Springs, South Dakota, Inc., was formed as a non -profit corporation dedicated to the pres ervation of the fossils, protecting and developing the site as an in-situ (bones left as found) exhibit.

Their descendants met the first French explorers and traders in the 1600s. The Big Sioux River, which flows south through the county, appears on maps published in Paris in 1702. The Sioux Indians arrived soon thereafter and have lived in the area for over 250 years. The area has had a colorful history. Indian countr y claimed by the French was ceded to Spain in 1762 and back to France in 1800. When Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana Territory in 1802, Minnehaha County was a part of that purchase. As part of the United States, the area was successfully under eight territorial flags: Louisiana, Indiana, Missouri, Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota and finally, Dakota Territory, organized in 1861. Minnehaha County was created by the Territorial Legislature in 1862. 194 The county, currently 24 miles north and south and 34 miles east and west had much of its surface formed by the Late Wisconsin Glacier, about 10,000 years ago. The falls of the Big Sioux River, its most notable feature, were formed from Precambrian pink quartzite about 1.7 billion years ago and have b een a regional landmark since earliest times. The first European known with certainty to have visited the falls was Philander Presecott in 1832. He was likely preceded and followed by a succession of explorers, trappers, and traders until the oxcarts an d covered wagons of the first permanent settlers arrived in 1856. With the outbreak of the Sioux War in 1862 and the ambush killing of two men at Sioux Falls, the entire settlement was evacuated and abandoned until the establishment of Fort Dakota in 1865 . The arrival of the first railroad in 1878 opened Minnehaha County to rapid growth. Civil War veterans and waves of European immigrants came to take up homesteads, and villages sprang up overnight. A turbulent era followed, marked by severe natural dis asters including floods, droughts, blizzards, and grasshopper plagues. South Dakota became a state in 1889. Gradually sod houses evolved into prosperous farmsteads by the end of World War I in 1918. Like the rest of the nation, Minnehaha County was transformed by World War II. An important Army Air Force Technical School was established at Sioux Falls, bringing diversity to our population. In time two interstate highways crossed the county, a large regional airport developed, and new technology tra nsformed agriculture.

The original group consisted of at least 38 dome -shaped burial mounds. Th ey were scattered irregularly for nearly a mile along the edge of the Big Sioux River flood plain northwest of this spot. It is supposed the builders carried thousands of baskets of dirt to form each mound. The original height of the mounds is unknown. They are now three to four feet above the ground level and the largest of the mounds are from 60 to 110 feet in diameter. Today, only 15 mounds remain substantially intact. Some have been totally destroyed be artifact hunters, while others have been lev eled by agricultural cultivation and natural erosion. In years past there have been numerous digging assaults on the mounds by amateurs. Sometimes they used destructive methods including horse -drawn scraper and dynamite while searching for artifacts. These sharply defined, highly visible mounds were first visited, mapped and named in 1860 by A.J. Hill, a St. Paul geographer. Nine of the mounds have been excavated, the first in 1869 by Dr. J.F. Boughter, a Fort Dakota surgeon. In 1883 A.H. Stites, who la ter became mayor of Sioux Falls, excavated the largest mound which, at the time, was ten feet high. He reported boulder outlines of a turtle and two large fish on opposite sides of the mound. These effigies have since disappeared. 195 Professional survey gro ups found skeletal remains of at least 78 humans. All original burials were below ground level generally in the center of the mounds. Searchers found a few artifacts in association with the burials, including objects of bone, red ochre, varied ornamental beads, disks made of local and marine shells and a few ceramic pot shards in Woodland patterns. W.E. Meyers of the Bureau of American Ethnology excavated several mounds in 1921 and believed there may also have been intrusive burials by both Ponca and Oma ha Indians. All excavation studies of these mounds have been partial and exploratory. Much remains to be learned about the people who built them, their methods of construction, their burial practices and the artifacts that accompanied the burials. In 1988 through the vision and generosity of landowners Wendell and Eva Shafer an Easement for Historic Preservation in perpetuity was filed to protect the remaining 15 mounds. The easement requires that the surface area must remain completely undisturbed as a cultural and historic resource for the people of this region.

Workers fastened beams together with diagonal bracing to create a strong, rigid framework. Each beam of a truss bridge shares a portion of the weight of the bridge to help displace the weight and stress of crossing traffic. The steel bridge rests on natural abutments of Sioux quartzite. A milldam bridge w as built nearby in 1870 when C.W. Patten erected a flour mill on high ground northwest of the dam. Water from Split Rock Creek powered the mill. Built of heavy timbers and large boulders, the bridge was wide enough to drive over with team and wagon. 196 In 1883 a bridge was built on this site. It made the uphill grade less abrupt for loaded wagons heading to Patten's Mill and the village of Palisade.

Charter No. 1 was issued to the Ladies Li brary Association of Howard on January 8, 1886, by M.L. McCormick, Territorial Secretary. In 1889, the City of Howard assumed ownership. During its first six years, the library was housed briefly in the Methodist Church and then in Boles General Store. It had only a large bookcase, open a few hours each week. The librarian's salary was 25 cents a week. On September 26, 1892, a disastrous fire swept away the Boles Store, destroying the library furnishings, its records and all but 11 books which were out on loan. Within three months, on January 21, 1893, the Library Board reopened the library in a corner of the city jail and gradually expanded into the City Council room. The library remained in this building for 74 years. In the early 1900's efforts we re made to build a Carnegie Library. A public election was held, plans were under way when World War I intervened and Carnegie grants were discontinued. In 1935 the city jail was moved and despite the depression, by 1938, the library had been remodeled and enlarged to use the entire building. A new Municipal Building was built in 1967 with room for a more up -to-date library. The historic building which housed the library for 74 years was purchased privately and given to Prairie Village, Madison, SD. The new Main Street location with enlarged holdings resulted in renewed public interest, and by its centennial year of 1986, the book collection had grown to exceed 12,000 volumes. One hundred years of continuous service to the community was celebrated with a year -long series of public events. With the same spirit and dedication of the original founders, the library was moved again in 1999 into the east end of the Municipal Building. The move tripled the size of the library to provide patrons with a more us eful working environment. Computers and new technology, along with books, are now resources for the 21st century.

In 1880 the Dakota Central Railway, a subsidiary of the Chicago & North Western, laid track following a wagon trail called the Black and Yellow Trail, now US Highway 14. This trail was so named because it led to the Black Hills and Yellowstone Country from Chicago. In 1883 Wolsey was platted by Magdalen Mosher who acquired the land from the railroad. Within two years the Chicago and Milwaukee RR, following what is now US Highway 281, laid track at the northwest edge of Wolsey called the 'Y' junction. Richard Sears, who later started Sears & Roebuck Company, was a depot agent in Wolsey for the C&NWRR. In 1890, Wolsey was in the running for state capital with railroad lands being the basis for its campaign. The opening of the Kaneb Pipe Line terminal in 1964 made Wolsey a hub for gas -hauling companies.

The Springdale Station depot was established here; later it became Hobsonville. In 1891, two years after statehood, it was renamed Shindler in memory of a pioneer homesteader. To serve the needs of area farmers, tradesmen built stores for their businesses and homes for their fa milies on this site. Businesses included the Shindler State Bank, a general store, hardware store and lumber yard, post office, blacksmith shop, garage and service station, grain elevator, stockyards for shipping of livestock by train, and a barber. The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Line, the successor railroad, provided daily passenger, freight, and mail services. A town hall opened in 1910 and quickly became the social hub for the small community. The hall hosted square dances, church services, Sund ay school, basketball games, school programs, Red Cross meetings, talent plays, and community parties. An annual diversion for area residents was provided when the circus train rolled through town. Parents and their excited children gathered at the depot and alongside the railroad tracks to wave at the railroad cars carrying wild animals and entertainers. During Prohibition years, three enterprising farmers built an open -air dance floor; dances were regularly held each summer with local bands providing th e music. The dances were dubbed 'Bowery dances' because it was rumored that a bootlegger who lived nearby provided alcohol for partygoers. Young people from surrounding towns flocked here for Saturday night dances, and Shindler residents referred to thos e from Sioux Falls as 'the packing house crowd.' The Great Depression of the 1930s, combined with years of drought and crop failures of area farmers, led to the decline of Shindler. The automobile replaced horse -drawn buggies and wagons. Dirt trails lead ing to larger towns became graveled roads which later became concrete highways. One by one the businesses closed, the bank failed, and residents moved away. The small town had served its purpose. When the post office closed in 1953, Shindler was no more .

In those raucous statewide elections, voters chose Pierre over Huron, Mitchell, Sioux Falls, Watertown, Chamberlain, and other challengers. Sutherland was a Progressive Republican. His 1904 capital campaign slogan, Stand Pat for Pierre, reflected his support for Theodore Roosevelt, whose 1904 re -election campaign theme was Stand Pat. In 1905, State Representative Sutherland introduced the legislation that started the construction of the State Capitol, which workers completed in 19 10.

His plane had no radio, literally no forward visibility, and only minimal navigation equipment, thus his flight was a true aviation \"first.\" His tour plan was to visit all the state capitals, stimulate interest in com mercial aviation, and demonstrate the safety and punctuality of flight. After a short exhibition of circles and maneuvers over Fort Pierre, Pierre, and the landing field; he landed. A crowd of 3800 including Governor Bulow and Mayor Hipple greeted his ar rival. American Legionnaires, led by Commander Charles H Burke, had prepared and secured the site. In attendance were 700 cars, 18 from out of state, and representatives from 39 SD counties. In an open car, Lindbergh led a long procession of cars though st reets of Pierre to the Saint Charles hotel where the special guests would spend the night. Following a supper reception at Mayor Hipple's home the American Legion Scotch band led the dignitaries to the front steps of the Capitol. Mayor Hipple spoke brief ly, Governor Bulow predicted that though Lindbergh had crossed the Atlantic and retuned to tell of it, someday some man would leave the earth, journey to the moon and return to tell of it. To the cheering crowd of 5000 Lindbergh spoke briefly confining hi s remarks to an explanation of his presence in Pierre. Lindbergh declared that his trip was the forerunner of a time in the near future when people of Pierre could leave the Pierre airport and arrive at the east or west coast on the same day. He remarked that Pierre was especially fortunate to have a natural landing field and claimed that it would be important for all cities to develop airports. After an appearance at the dance in the City Auditorium he returned to the St. Charles for the night.

Though details of his youth are scarce, he grew up at a time when the Sioux were a powerful force on the northern plains. His life spanned an era of unprecedented transition, stretchi ng from a period of Sioux dominance to the eventual settlement of the Sioux onto reservations by the U.S. Government. Iron Nation was a chief during difficult times. As Head Chief, he signed significant treaties including the 1865 Fort Laramie Treaty, 1876 Black Hills Treaty and 1889 Great Sioux Reservation Treaty on behalf of the Lower Brule. Iron Nation lived his life seeking the survival of the Lower Brule Sioux. His life covered 79 of the most disastrous and tumultuous years that the Lower Brule people , and many other Native Americans, have endured. Iron Nation was respected not because he was a warrior or a Ghost Dancer, but because he was a chief and a peacemaker. He never took up arms against the U.S. government, choosing peace instead. Iron Nation died on 14 November 1894 at Iron Nation District of the Lower Brule Sioux Reservation. He was buried here at Messiah Episcopal cemetery. Inscribed on his granite monument are these words: \"Children, Love One Another.\" The granite monument placed over Iron Nation's grave is the first known commemorative monument erected over the grave of a Lakota Sioux chief by a tribe in South Dakota. This gravesite represents a significant change in burial practices and memorializations that occurred as Native American an d Anglo cultures coalesced during this period.

The building represents an interesting and well -executed adaptation of the style to the needs of the small frontier community and is the most important commercial building erected in Fort Pierre during the 20th century. The bank symbolizes the commercial development of Fort Pierre during the early 20th century as the business center for much of western South Dakota's cattle raising activity. The two -story, brick building dominates the center of town. The cut sandstone foundation, polygonal corner tower with ornamental festoons, d ecorative brickwork and arched windows with brick keystones set it apart. The Stockgrowers Bank quickly became the most prestigious office and commercial building in Fort Pierre. In addition to the bank itself, one other tenant included the first telepho ne exchange in Fort Pierre. The 1860 census listed 15 people living in town. The Discovery of Gold in the Black Hills changed all of that. By 1877, Fort Pierre was a boom town of 300 plus people with stores, hotels, saloons and huge freight warehouses. So much was coming up river by steamboat that freight was stacked up along the river bank awaiting overland transport. On an average, five wagon trains with a total of 75 wagons filled with freight and feed would leave for the Black Hills. Charles L. Mi llett and his wife settled in Fort Pierre in 1890 when the Great Sioux Reservation opened to white settlement. They established squatter rights for their residence in April of that year and officially incorporated a banking enterprise at the corner of Dea dwood and Main Streets, the future site of the Stockgrowers Bank. In 1903, Millett, along with Gaylord E. Sumner and James (Scotty) Philip, constructed the building and began the Stockgrowers Bank which became the business center.

Speaking to the Black and Yellow Trail Association in January 1924, Robinson proposed his idea to carve legendary figures of the American West into the Black Hills Needles formation. He believed the monument would be a special attraction to draw visitors to the scenic landscape and develop tourism to diversify the state economy. Robinson shared the idea with Senator Peter Norbeck who provided key political support. Enlist ing artist Gutzon Borglum, they agreed on presidents as subjects of national significance and Mount Rushmore as the best site. Robinson worked with the state legislature for initial funding, coordinated with Norbeck for Borglum's initial visits, promoted the idea around the state, and was an early leader of the memorial association. Borglum's final design for the Mount Rushmore National Memorial was built from 1927 to 1941. Doane Mountain, located along Memorial Highway, was named for Robinson, to honor the \"Father of Mount Rushmore.\" Erected: 2017 Location: Pennington County, Robinson Tunnel on Iron Mountain Road #714 Joe Foss: American Hero and Governor of South Dakota Joe Foss was born in Sioux Falls on April 17, 1915.

He sent son Will down to a stream with a canvas water sack to ge t water for the car. Doane looked up and envisioned a westerner like Jim Bridger, Kit Carson or Red Cloud carved into the spires. He and Will were members of the Black and Yellow Trails Association which promoted tourism between Chicago and Yellowstone. Doane saw this inspiration as a unique way of drawing people to the state and to the beauty of the Black Hills. From the inception of this idea to its fruition, Robinson worked closely with Sen. Peter Norbeck, Rep. William Williamson, and John Boland who provided tireless support. One year later he toured the area with sculptor Gutzon Borglum, who found quartz, feldspar and mica mixed with the granite which was not ideal for carving. Impressed by the Spires, Borglum also reflected, \"Who is he, but a man, to improve upon the hand of God.\" They found suitable granite at a nearby mountain where work began on Mount Rushmore in 1927, and Robinson's inspiration became a reality.
