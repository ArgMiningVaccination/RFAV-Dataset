Most of our foods are heavily processed or contain synthetic ingredients. These are packed with added fats, sugars, chemicals, preservatives, food dyes, and other additives that may make the food taste good but our bodies do not process it (or break it down into energy) well. The clean eating diet is all the rage from celebrities, doctors, and nutritionists around the world. According to [Clean Eating Mag](http://www.cleaneatingmag.com/), most people who adopt a clean diet eat items such as unrefined whole grains, an abundance of fresh produce, and free-range or grass-fed meat and dairy, alongside nuts, avocados, olive, and coconut oil for a hearty dose of natural, healthy fats. These can be found at your local grocery store in the organic section, or freshly gathered at your closest farmer's market, or a more sustainable and humane source of meats and dairy from local farmers. What's this got to do with diabetes? Physicians at [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/diet/eat-clean-diet) agree that a clean eating diet may be beneficial for people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Unlike other fad diets, the clean eating method focuses on nutritional balance and value. No food groups are cut out and people with diabetes can still get the carbs and sugar they need. Instead of processed and packaged foods, pick out healthier sources of those needed carbs and sugars. For example, instead of reaching for an over-processed cookie eat fresh fruits instead. Tips and Tricks to Clean Eating Some packaged and processed foods make them easy to prepare and more affordable. Over time, marketing has made us all think that eating clean is going to be super expensive. Well, it isn't always the case. Here are some simple tricks you can do to eat clean and keep it budget-friendly: - Stick with seasonal produce - Buy generic-based products - Practice meal planning (check out some of our videos on this) - Cook at home - Eat more plant-based proteins - Check for discount deals - Purchase frozen fruits and veggies - Save food scraps - Practice proper food storage - Buy in bulk In the long run, a clean diet with these neat tricks can save you money and help improve your health. Summary While there is no diet deemed \"perfect\" for people with diabetes, the clean way of eating has been proven to be safe and effective in helping people lose weight and take control of their blood sugar levels. Before you begin a new eating schedule, make sure to talk to your doctor about foods and eating plans that work best for you and your body. Also remember that clean eating was not designed to be a fad diet. Eating well is a lifestyle choice that can not only help you control your diabetes now but may also work to prevent complications or health concerns in the future.
