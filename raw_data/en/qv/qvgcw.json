More specifically, it aims to develop faculties of perceptive imagination, inspiration and intuition through cultivating a form of thinking independent of sensory experience, and to present the results thus derived in a manner subject to rational verification. Rudolf Steiner wrote, \"Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe. It arises in people as a need of the heart, or feeling life. It is justified only to the degree that it can satisfy this inner need.\" He identified seven preliminary requirements for embarking on such a path of development: - Striving to develop a healthy body and soul. - Feeling connected with all of existence; to recognize oneself in everything, and everything in oneself; not to judge others without standing in their shoes. - Recognizing that one's thoughts and feelings have as significant an influence as one's deeds, and that work on one's inner life is as important as work on one's outer life. - Recognizing that the true essence of a human being does not lie in the person's outer appearance, but rather in the inner nature, in the soul and spiritual existence of this person. - Finding the genuine balance between having an open heart for the demands of the outer world and maintaining inner strength and \"unshakeable endurance.\" - The ability to be true to a decision once made, even in the face of daunting adversity, until one comes to the conclusion that it was or is made in error. - Developing thankfulness for everything that meets us, and that universal love that allows the world to reveal itself fully to oneself.
