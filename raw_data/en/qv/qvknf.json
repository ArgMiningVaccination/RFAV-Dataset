Chiropractic Care In our office we evaluate your situation from a whole body perspective, a 3-D view point. Utilizing muscle response testing, we are able to determine the precise location and cause of your complaint or condition. This testing also allows us to determine if your condition has any organ involvement, because the same nerve that causes a muscle or bone to hurt, also allows the organ to function or not to function correctly. Muscle response testing also allows us to determine if your body is vitamin or mineral deficient, which will also be responsible for inadequate healing of your condition. We re-align your spinal condition utilizing the Impulse Adjusting Instrument, we correct the surrounding soft tissue or musculature utilizing the Vibra-Cussor Instrument and provide rehabilitation of a specific area utilizing Pulsed Magnetic Therapy. DID YOU KNOW? When the body is under a high level of physical or emotional stress, the adrenal glands may become over-taxed and unable to synthesize optimal levels of adrenal hormones. The result may be dehydration, which interferes with nutrient delivery and contributes to aging and kidney problems. Improper adrenal function also affects the heart, causing a wide range of concerns, including arrhythmia, reduced cardiac output, hypertension and possible heart attacks.

On Purpose Dear Friends, All too often it is the practitioner who gets all the information about the patient, and the patient gets too little information about the doctor. I would like to begin to change this. My full name is Richard Anthony Ramos, I was born in Burlington, CO. I was raised in a family of 7 children and graduated from Stratton High School. I attended college at Cleveland Chiropractic in Kansas City, MO and graduated in December 1993. I have three beautiful, intelligent caring children, Tiffany, Christian and Madisson. I have been truly blessed by my father in heaven to have them in my life. I am excited to see them blaze their own life paths. I am enthusiastic about cooking, especially for the holidays. I enjoy spending time with family, friends and the outdoors, specifically the mountains. The mountains make me feel closer to my Father in Heaven. I was originally led to be a healing practitioner because my father was a chiropractor for 51 years, along with my uncle, two brothers and a niece. Growing up in my dads office I continually experienced the lives of people being changed or affected by compassion, either by words or a simple touch of the human hand. Today, I am in this amazing healing profession because I have an inner spiritual desire to help people change their lives. I am blessed to help show you how you can have a bigger, better and a more productive life. To begin a journey of healing that you did not think was possible. I have chosen to devote my life to this healing profession because I believe there is more to life than pain and sorrow. We can help people create a better quality of life by eliminating pain, or removing hidden obstacles so you can achieve better fulfillment with your health, family and dreams in this journey of life. I am grateful that I was called to this profession because I have experienced the presence of the Holy Spirit among all of us. He has allowed me to become more caring, loving, spirit-filled which prepares us for a better life, a better place for our children and family with less pain and suffering among our fellow friends. I believe with all my heart in the principles of the innate intelligence and natural healing which is Chiropractic, Above - Down - Inside - Out! I emphatically believe with all my heart how I practice this healing art and will continue to strive to improve myself. I believe I give an excellent service for a fair fee. We are here to help you and your loved ones to believe what you think is impossible is possible! We ask you to refer and continue to refer practice members to our office because we will always provide the absolute fullest desire to eliminate any problems that may be hindering you or affecting your quality of life, either physically, emotionally, or spiritually. I established this office in Kit Carson County because I wanted to give back to the communities of which I was raised and where my core beliefs were developed. The whole purpose of this office is to provide a healing environment that people desire to come to and be provided with excellent loving care. This office is unique as we combine state of the art technique and equipment along with the blessings of the Holy Spirit which resides in our office. My personal promise to you is to provide Exceptional care, Exceptional service, and to demonstrate to you what you don't think is possible. God Bless, Dr. Richard A. Ramos, DC "}
