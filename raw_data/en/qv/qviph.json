But as with most things, liking the [idea of clean eating](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/how-to-start-clean-eating/) is a whole lot easier than actually [putting a plan into place](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/meal-prep-ideas-healthy-eating/). After all, microwave meals can be convenient (and sometimes [aren't all that bad for you](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/healthy-microwave-meals/)), and it's often easier to snack on chips than to take the time to slice an apple or peel an orange. That's why we did the [hard work](https://dailyburn.com/program/sweat_sessions) for you, with this weeklong menu filled with clean eats. Print out the whole list and head to the grocery store, or simply pick and choose your favorite meals (leftovers are totally allowed!). \"It's just trying to stay away from the [overly processed foods](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/ewg-food-scores-food-calculator/) and get back to nature \u2014 high-vitamin, nutrient-dense meals,\" says Fitness and Nutrition Coach Melinda Harvey. RELATED: [6 Easy Tips for Clean Eating on a Small Budget](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/clean-eating-budget-tips/) Thanks to Harvey, the meal plan below is structured in a way that will keep you satiated \u2014 not deprived. \"Go for [protein](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/protein-sources-infographic/) and [fiber](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/how-much-fiber-high-fiber-foods/), they're the best to fill up your stomach,\" she says. \"A lot of people when they decide to go on a diet, they're just eating iceberg lettuce \u2014 but it's just not going to keep you full or satisfied.\" Plus, many of the recipes utilize similar ingredients (like quinoa), which you can [cook in big batches](http://dailyburn.com/life/health/meal-prep-ideas-healthy-eating/) so you're not spending all week in the kitchen. While it might take a little more effort than your usual go-to's of takeout and freezer food, the results will be worth it, Harvey says. Yes, even in a week. \"Most people say they see a [boost in their energy](http://dailyburn.com/life/lifestyle/exhausted-signs-tips/) when they start clean eating just because they're getting so many more nutrients out of their food,\" Harvey says. \"Digestion-wise they say they see positive effects... and people generally say they feel lighter.\" Sounds good? We think so, too. Here's how to get started!
