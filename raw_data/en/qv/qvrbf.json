Whether these shifts are purely physical or combined with mental and emotional changes - our approach ensures the most benefit with the least amount of side effects. Pain Management We have many modalities at our disposal - including acupuncture, cupping, electrical stimulation, cranio-sacral, tui-na, hot stone and massage therapy - to help reduce or eliminate your acute or chronic pain syndromes. Digestive Health Your gut is the soil in your garden of health. When it is in balance, all other body systems will blossom. Many health disorders have roots in poor digestion. Let us help bring equilibrium back to your gastro-intestinal tract. Acupuncture Acupuncture is a method of encouraging the body to promote natural healing and to improve functioning. This is done by inserting needles and applying heat or electrical stimulation at very precise acupuncture points. [ ](#) Learn More Learn More The classical Chinese explanation is that channels of energy run in regular patterns through the body and over its surface. These energy channels, called meridians, are like rivers flowing through the body to irrigate and nourish the tissues. An obstruction in the movement of these energy rivers is like a dam that backs up. The meridians can be influenced by needling the acupuncture points; the acupuncture needles unblock the obstructions at the dams, and reestablish the regular flow through the meridians. Acupuncture treatments can therefore help the body's internal organs to correct imbalances in their digestion, absorption, and energy production activities, and in the circulation of their energy through the meridians. The modern scientific explanation is that needling the acupuncture points stimulates the nervous system to release chemicals in the muscles, spinal cord, and brain. These chemicals will either change the experience of pain, or they will trigger the release of other chemicals and hormones which influence the body's own internal regulating system. The improved energy and biochemical balance produced by acupuncture results in stimulating the body's natural healing abilities, and in promoting physical and emotional well-being. In addition to needle insertion along the meridians, Dr. Vaelli offers many modalities in the tradition of Chinese Medicine including cupping, moxibustion, dry needling, auricular therapy, herbal medicine, gua-sha, tui-na, shiatsu, pediatric shonishin and mei zen cosmetic acupuncture. Botanical Medicine Botanical medicine, also called Herbal medicine or Phytomedicine, is the practice of using plants either alone or in formula combinations to promote health and well-being. Herbal medicine is helpful in both chronic, long-standing conditions and acute situations such as colds and flues. [ ](#) Learn More Learn More Herbs can be effective on multiple levels, are non-addictive, present few adverse effects compared with pharmaceutical medicines and are suitable for all ages. Dr. Vaelli is trained in both western and Chinese herbal medicine and enjoys finding a constitutional herbal formula for her patients that is specific to their needs. She believes when taking herbal medicines and/or supplements that \"less is more.\" Often people are taking too many herbs and/or supplements. It is easy to read about the benefits of one product or the other and before you know it you are on a myriad of herbs and supplements. With too many herbs and supplements, your body gets easily confused and overwhelmed and the therapeutic benefits of each product are diminished. Let Dr. Vaelli help you find the formula that is right for your specific constitution. She also helps her patients rotate their herbal formulas throughout the seasons, supporting their specific health needs at different times of the year. Nutrition We can counsel on a healthful diet, identification and elimination of food sensitivities, optimal weight control and supplementation with appropriate and patient-specific vitamins and minerals. [ ](#) Learn More Learn More Medical nutrition therapy is a dietary intervention that is used to prevent or treat health conditions that are caused by or made worse by specific eating habits. It's hard to ignore the link between nutrition and health. You may follow the standard American diet, appropriately abbreviated as SAD, regularly consuming foods like pizza, burgers, fries, ice cream and soda OR you may follow a vegan diet, eating only organic foods... Both may cause gastro-intestinal upset and other imbalances in your body. Dr. Vaelli's form of nutritional therapy centers around three things: 1. Food Sensitivity Testing and Elimination (learn more about our food testing [here!](https://longmonthealingarts.com/food-sensitivity-testing/)) 2. Gastro-intestinal health and integrity of the gut mucosa so that your food can be well digested and absorbed 3. Eating according to your specific constitution and according to the seasons For meal planning and recipes, specific weight loss plans and individualized nutrient evaluation - Dr. Vaelli will refer out. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, there are 5 elements - Fire, Earth, Metal, Water and Wood. Every person can fit, for the most part, into one of these 5 elements. Every one of us could become healthier and bring our bodies out of dis-ease and into ease and balance when we consume more of the foods that are specific for our constitution and less of the foods that are harmful for our constitution. It's that simple! The seasons are also reflected in the 5-element system. Eating according to the seasons will bring about improved health and vitality. Learn how. Schedule an appointment today. There are also foods that are both beneficial and harmful for specific conditions you may be experiencing including blood sugar imbalances such as diabetes or hypoglycemia; gastro-intestinal disorders such as IBS and Celiac; blood disorders such as anemia, poor circulation or menstrual disorders; and other conditions including cancer, arthritis, asthma, MS and skin disorders. Specialized Laboratory Testing We provide specialized laboratory testing to assess health of gastro-intestinal tract, hormone balance, adrenal function, toxic load, nutritional status, food sensitivities and more...

Cupping and Moxibustion [ ](#) Learn More Learn More In a typical cupping session, glass cups are warmed using a cotton ball soaked in alcohol that is placed inside the cup. This removes all of the oxygen, which creates a vacuum. The cup is then placed over a specific area of the body, most often the back, neck and shoulders but can also be placed on the chest for respiratory conditions, the stomach for digestive disorders and the thighs and legs for pain syndromes. The vacuum that is created anchors the cup to the skin and pulls the skin upward on the inside of the glass as the air inside the jar cools. Drawing up the skin has the effect of opening up the skin's pores, which helps to stimulate the flow of blood, break up obstructions and create an avenue for toxins to be drawn out of the body. It allows the layers of tissue - the skin, fat, fascia, muscle and bone - to separate from each other, breaking up adhesions and scar tissue and creating space between the layers to promote the movement of blood and Qi and to alleviate pain. Depending on the condition being treated, the cups are either left in place for 5 to 10 minutes (stationary cupping) or will be moved around the area by the practitioner (running or gliding cupping.) Cupping may be used to treat tight and/or painful areas in your body; respiratory conditions such as bronchitis, asthma, colds and flues; arthritis; gastrointestinal disorders; and is used as a general detoxification treatment. It has also been shown to alleviate depression and anxiety, treat insomnia and increase over-all "}
