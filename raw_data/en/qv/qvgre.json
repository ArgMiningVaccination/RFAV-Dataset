Still, we owe debts of gratitude to early civilizations for laying foundations that continue to support the ever-advancing worlds of medicine and healthcare. Our integrative family practice here in the Colchester, VT area provides osteopathic care, which was built upon gaps in allopathic care, and has since provided a foundation for functional medicine. If you are looking for Integrative family practice Burlington VT, we can help you. Both osteopathic and functional medicine practices are leading-edge and, together, help to provide support and answers for people who are suffering with acute and chronic conditions, often with minimal or no pharmaceutical medications. In fact, Seka Palikuca from the American Osteopathic Association says, \"Part of the success of functional medicine is grounded in what might be considered an osteopathic approach to care: partnering with your patient and believing in the body's innate ability to heal.\" What is osteopathic medicine, exactly? Osteopathic medicine stems from A.T. Still's philosophy of wellness, dating back as far as 1874. He recognized that treating illness successfully required consideration of the whole body, not just it's symptomatic parts. Osteopathic manual medicine (OMM) is a distinct branch of medicine in the U.S. (and growing to varying degrees across the world) that emphasizes the inter-relationship of all systems within the body. OMM focuses on the relationship between the neuromusculoskeletal system and the rest of the body to restore optimal functionality by removing barriers to physiological, anatomical, and pathological motion. Osteopaths refer to the latest science and technology-based treatment options, but also practice more holistic therapies to complement or enhance the success of conventional practices.Their approach is whole-person centered....meaning, they look beneath the symptoms to understand how things like bioindividuality, lifestyle practices, environmental factors, and fixed mindsets can impact their patients' overall wellness. Is an Osteopath a \"real\" doctor? Most definitely! Doctors of osteopathy are physicians who complete 4 years of medical school and can practice in any medical specialty. Osteopathic physicians also receive an additional 300 to 500 hours in the study of hands-on manual medicine and the body's musculoskeletal system. Osteopathic doctors are licensed physicians at the national and state level, and can become Board Certified after completing residencies within their specialty area, just like an MD. What is functional medicine? Functional medicine is an approach to medicine that focuses on identifying and addressing the root cause of disease. This approach requires a detailed understanding of each patient's genetic, biochemical, and lifestyle factors and leverages data to direct personalized treatment plans. Unlike osteopathic medicine, there isn't a medical school for functional medicine. Rather, functional medicine doctors are fully licensed doctors (MDs, DOs, etc.) who have gone through traditional medical school training. They may then choose to get additional training and certifications in functional medicine. A traditional MD or DO, for example, can receive additional training in functional medicine and apply that knowledge to their original field of practice. What are the similarities between functional medicine and osteopathic medicine? Both of these types of medicine consider the whole person, addressing underlying causes of illness, rather than just masking symptoms. They both encourage healthy lifestyle habits while addressing the full range of physical, mental, and environmental influences that affect a person's well-being. They also both respect that the body has an innate healing ability. What are the differences between functional medicine and osteopathic medicine? While the core of these approaches is very similar, osteopathic physicians are unique in that they have advanced training in osteopathic manual medicine (OMM), which is a hands-on technique used to help facilitate healing in the bones, joints, tissues, and muscles of the body. The musculoskeletal system influences and reflects the condition of all other systems in the body. Are there specific benefits of Osteopathic Medicine? Osteopathic medicine is both distinct from and equivalent to conventional care. Since a DO investigates beyond the physical symptoms that present themselves, and specializes in the subtle manipulation of the body's primary mass (aka: the musculoskeletal system), there are numerous benefits to choosing osteopathic care. One of the primary benefits is the ability to provide symptom relief, and often condition-reversal, without the use of drugs (or with minimal, short-duration use only). The overall approach of OMM is root-cause identification instead of symptom-treatment. This means that patients suffer less and return to wellness faster. OMM also has a strong emphasis on preventative healthcare....addressing many imbalances before they become more serious conditions. The following list shows some common conditions that are greatly (if not completely) relieved with osteopathic care: Which approach should you choose? Osteopathic and functional medicine physicians will both approach your care with an investigative eye and recommend therapies that support the innate ability to rebalance and heal that we all have. With an osteopathic physician you gain the added benefit of important musculoskeletal realignments that open numerous pathways within the body, often speeding up the healing process. We are all bioindividual. We each have a unique composition and can express common conditions in different ways. More serious and progressing imbalances may also require the care of conventional specialists and medications. Who you choose to support you in restoring optimal health is a very personal choice and, ultimately, one that you should feel confident in trusting so that you're not adding doubt to your list of concerns. So, talk to different doctors and consider what you're most in need of. Don't be afraid to ask lots of questions and to be an active participant in your healing journey.
