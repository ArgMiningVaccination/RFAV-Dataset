The workplan outlined below was prepared according to the SRF Guidelines and the State Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs Guidance. I. Funding Amount South Dakota has set aside 10% of its FY1997 Drinking Water Revolving Fund allotment for source water assessment and protection. This is $1,255,880. Other funding sources will be used to supplement this effort. These potential funds include Public Water System Supervision, Nonpoint Source 319, 106 Ground Water and potentially other environmental funding sources. II. Full Time Employees A minimum of three and one half (3.5) department FTEs will be utilized for the development of South Dakota's Source Water Protection Program. These positions include two natural resources engineers and a combination of a natural resources engineer, a hydrologist, a natural resources administrator, and a combination of employees from various programs in the department.

These dollars are a one-time set-aside that are only available from the 1997 fiscal year allotment and must be applied for no later than September 30, 1998. The money can be banked for four years. No match is required. Estimates of costs exceed funds available by approximately $974,000. III. Goals and Objectives, Outputs, and Deliverables The goal of the source water assessment program is to protect and benefit public water systems by delineating source water protection areas, inventorying contamination sources, and determining susceptibility of the water supply. The goal of South Dakota's workplan for SRF set-asides is to complete the source water assessment program within the time frame allowed by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The following activities will be completed to meet the goal: 1. Organize technical meetings. These meetings are tentatively scheduled for April, May, July, and September. 2. Develop the source water assessment program document for EPA approval. 3. Host several water users meetings. 4. Develop and administer contracts for a portion of the assessments. 5. Work with DENR's citizen boards to develop program. 6. Host several public participation meetings to gather input on the document. 7. Complete source water assessments for the 760 public water systems. 8. Provide the results of the assessments to the public water systems. 9. Provide assistance to local communities in the development of source water protection programs. The department will continue to work on the wellhead protection portion of source water assessments while waiting for EPA approval. This includes delineations and pollution source inventories. These components of the assessments will be done in accordance with South Dakota's EPA-approved Wellhead Protection Program for public water systems dependent on ground water. Assessments for systems dependent on surface water sources or combined surface water/ground water sources and the susceptibility analyses for all systems will not be done using set-aside funds until EPA has approved the source water assessment program. The outputs include: 1. Source water assessment program document. 2. Possible contracts with entities outside the department to conduct assessments. 3. Public meeting summaries. 4. Completed assessments including maps with delineated areas and potential pollution sources and results of susceptibility analyses.Appendix B: Intended Use Workplan A-215. Results of assessments made available to the public through paper and electronic format. The source water assessment program document and the 760 completed assessments are the deliverables for this set-aside. IV.

Summary of Wellhead Protection Program: Established in 1989. Gave SD DENR authority to produce guidance document; gave counties authority to zone wellhead protection areas. Wellhead Protection Program is a voluntary program developing across South Dakota. With the Wellhead Protection Program, however, surface water supplies are not addressed. Safe Drinking Water Act 1996 Amendments requires each state to develop a Source Water Assessment and Protection Program which will include: 1. delineating areas of contribution to all public water supplies in the state (including wellhead protection areas, watersheds for sources of drinking water supplies); 2. identifying potential sources of pollution; 3. performing susceptibility/vulnerability analysis; and 4. informing the public and including public participation during program development. There are 760 public water supplies in South Dakota which need to be included in the program, including rest stops along the interstates, campgrounds, and community water systems. Technical Advisory Committee needs to come to a consensus regarding: 1. extent of search for potential sources of pollution;Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-282. how to handle the complex watersheds in the Black Hills; 3. how to handle the water sources where surface water and groundwater contribute to a water supply, such as along the Big Sioux River Basin; and 4. how to handle the water sources near the borders of the state, such as those along the Missouri River. Source Water Assessment and Protection Plan Overview Tricia Sebes Source Water Protection is a pollution prevention measure that focuses on protecting the area surrounding public drinking water supplies. 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments allows states to set aside up to 10% of the fiscal 1997 Drinking Water State Revolving Funds; requires states to develop a Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP); and requires states to complete source water assessments for all public water supply systems. A complete Source Water Assessment Program Document will describe how South Dakota will accomplish the following: 1. Involve the public 2.Approach the assessments 3.Distribute the information to the public 4.Implement the SWAP Public Participation: 1. Technical Advisory Committee - consists of representatives from all DENR Programs (except air quality) and representatives of outside agency and organizations 2. Citizens Advisory Committee - consists of Board of Water Management and Board of Water and Natural Resources 3. General Public Involvement - DENR will be holding a series of public meetings across the state to gather input on the SWAP and DENR must include a responsiveness summary showing public comments and how they were addressed Distribution of Information: 1. Will use Geographic Information System (GIS) to make assessments available to the public 2. Information may be made available to the public through the internet (via DENR and EPA homepage), at public water supply offices, at public libraries, through water bill inserts, and direct mailing. Implementation of SWAP: Intended Use Work Plan described briefly. Program document must be submitted to EPA by February 1999; EPA has 9 months to review document; South Dakota has 3.5 years to complete 760 assessments. Approach to Assessments: 1. Delineate boundaries of assessment areas using all available hydrogeologic information for both ground and surface water systems. 2. Conduct a contaminant source inventory within the delineated area. 3. Assess the \"susceptibility\" of the source water to potential releases from the identified contaminant sources - extent of this assessment has not yet been defined. EPA Perspective Mike Wireman EPA has 3 person team for Source Water Assessment and Protection Program: John Giedt (overall program coordinator), Mike Wireman (technical contact person for state on Source Water Assessment and Protection), and Jack Theis (contact person for state on intended use plan). Each person oversees two states. Money has been set aside for this program through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. Other money available through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund in addition to the 10% of the state's allotment to administer or provide technical assistance for SWP programs for buying land, etc ... The Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) was suggested as a potential incentive measure for source water protection, as it was used for the wellhead protection program. However, Mike indicated that the CRP budget is limited and he thinks that the CRP money may not be available widespread. At this time, EPA needs a work plan. The work plan should provide a priority scheme. A checklist is coming out which is intended to guide states in conducting assessments from EPA headquarters. Checklist is currently being revised.Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-29The concept of a water source's susceptibility to pollution is absent in the wellhead protection program, but it has been included in the SWAP Program. States need to evaluate the sum measure of risk to a water source by potential pollution sources. A technical guidance document for evaluating susceptibility is being prepared and is expected to be out this calendar year. Source area delineation is straightforward for groundwater, but no guidance exists for surface water source area delineation in the SWAP. Mike suggested delineating the entire area above an intake. Large protection areas will be a fact of life with. surface water protection. Mike has some guidance documents , the EPA is finalizing items for conjunctive delineation. Mike believes that non-point sources will encompass large areas and may become problematic when identifying potential contaminant sources. There is a new focus on characterizing and dealing with non-point sources, as it has been poorly addressed in the past. A total maximum daily load (TMDL) is a quantitative assessment of the cumulative loading of stream from contributing point and non-point pollutant sources. The EPA encourages states to use relevant information from existing TMDL programs to help complete source water delineations and assessments. The notice for the groundwater disinfection rule will be coming out in the Federal Register. This rule is aimed at making a determination of whether a ground water system needs to disinfect to eliminate viruses. States should review the strategies being considered for the groundwater disinfection rule, such as requiring setback distances for microbial sources, establishing the non-vulnerability/susceptibility of a groundwater source to microbial contamination. The EPA is working to get governmental agencies on board with source water protection in public lands, such as those in the National Forests. Tom Brandner (DENR) asked about Tribal lands. Mike stated that Indian reservations are officially exempt from program, but EPA Region VIII will help Tribes if they indicate interest. Bill Markley (DENR) said that he has offered to provide assistance to tribes during semi-annual meetings. There have been no takers. There are no funds officially designated for this purpose in South Dakota, anyway, but other funding sources are possible. Source water assessments and protection will be a major point of discussion during future semi-annual meetings with the Tribes. Other states are at the same point in this program as South Dakota. They have also set aside money that needs to be expended within four years (which works out to be the end of September 2001 for South Dakota). South Dakota could spend the money now, but any work completed prior to EPA's formal approval of the SWAP Work Plan must be acceptable to EPA. Because South Dakota's wellhead protection program has already been approved by the EPA, there should be no problem with going ahead with the groundwater assessments. Work Plan for the State Revolving Fund Intend Use Plan Tricia Sebes The following summary include comments from and discussion between the representatives of the TAC: The Intended Use Work Plan was reviewed. The citizen board and DENR programs have approved the Intended Use Work Plan. Discussion included coordinating efforts between programs with standardized methods to maximize currently available funds outside of the State Revolving Fund set-aside (carry over money, etc...). The State Revolving Fund set-aside may or may not be used to pay salaries of full-time employees. The money must be for someone working on source water assessment and protection. Use of funds must actually go to performance of assessments. SD won't have to touch SRF funds right now. Assessments will be performed by DENR staff, including those in the Geological Survey, and, if necessary, by outside contractors. Discussed concerns regarding standardized criteria for assessments for consistency between SDGS and outside contractors. The TAC will be working on the standardization. Discussed public meeting notification: a comment was made that the municipal league and rural water systems need to be involved, but both organizations have representatives in the TAC. The Municipal League will be meeting this month , the DENR will send a representative to discuss the SWAP program.Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-30The availability of assessments is not a criteria for funding by communities for source water protection. Discussed the need for a strategy to move from source water assessments performed by the State into source water protection measures implemented by communities. A petition program is available to establish a pool of money for distribution to public water supplies which are experiencing problems. This program is a source of funding for the correction of problems identified after the assessments are complete. It was clarified that the Intended Use Plan is a plan brought in with a grant application, which describes fund usage. The Intended Use Work Plan is a more detailed statement for a given activity of what the state intends to do. This work plan is prepared annually for future funding. Due to lack of additional comments, the DENR will submit the Intended Use Work Plan to the EPA with no additional comments from TAC. Prioritization of Public Water Supply Systems Tricia Sebes Lists of public water supplies, along with the proposed prioritization were included in the informational package handed out at the beginning of the meeting. The surface water prioritization may change as information comes in and communities express interest. The list does not include systems served by other systems (an example was presented in handout). The aquifers were ranked first by vulnerability, and then by population. The surface water sources were ranked by population. The water supplies in the Black Hills were simply queried out and listed by population. If the vulnerability of a water supply was unknown, it was assumed to be vulnerable. Emphasized that the list is merely a prioritization scheme: all public water supplies will be assessed. Public water supplies where wellhead protection areas have been established (such as the City of Brookings) will likely require less work during the source water assessment. Wellhead protection area information will be used as the basis of the source water assessment. Only the aquifer susceptibility study and surface water delineation would need to be performed in those cases. The TAC reached a consensus that the DENR will use the prioritization presented. Discussion of Public Participation Requirements Tom Brandner Items regarding public participation in the handout were reviewed. Public input is required on the technical aspects of the program. The DENR is planning to have meetings in Pierre and is considering using the Rural Development Telecommunications Network. The TAC discussed involving public at large. Mike Wireman suggested involving representatives of rural water systems and the Rural Water Association. It was also suggested that the DENR present information regarding the Source Water Assessment Program to water system operators during their training sessions. It's very important to get public participation in the Source Water Assessment and Protection Programs to gain acceptance. The Source Water Assessment Plan needs to be flexible and should be adjusted for each public water supply. The TAC discussed how to identify non-point sources. The source water assessments should not include names (of owners or operators) of non-point sources due to concerns about public perception. Therefore, it was suggested that the source water assessments merely identify critical 40-acre cells. The Agricultural Non-point Source ( AgNPS) Model can be used for cropland area but it was not designed for rangeland. The AgNPS Model is good for nutrient and sediment loading. The TAC discussed how to address storm water. Mike Wireman indicated that storm water retention basins need to be adequately designed. Both non-point and point sources come and go, so at some point in time, it looks as if the source water assessments will need to be updated. There is no provision by the EPA to update the source water assessments, but the DENR anticipates that the source water assessment documents will be dynamic and will be updated beyond the year 2003. Mike Wireman suggested including updates as part of the work plan. There is a need to coordinate the databases within and outside of the DENR. The United States Geological Survey and South Dakota Department of Game, Fish, and Parks have information that may be useful to the source water assessments. It was suggested that the water system operator be involved during the assessments to help identify sources in general. This is a very time-consuming method, but it works.Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-31Neither the EPA nor the DENR wants to generate a document that nobody will use. After the assessments are completed, cities, counties, and other public water suppliers need methods to protect their source water. Mike Wireman indicated that the use of monitoring waivers is one tool. Once local public water suppliers realize that they have control, they will manage their source water areas. At this time, there is no specific legislation to require local implementation of a Source Water Protection Program and there are no plans in the near future. However, this legislation may be coming 10 years down the line. Foster Sawyer (DENR - Geologic Survey) commented that the hydrogeologic unit maps may not be accurate enough and that he is not comfortable with counties writing zoning regulations based on those maps and potentially going to court with developers. Mike Wireman indicated that he hopes that 1:250,000-scale maps are not used by the counties; the 1:24,000-scale maps may be precise enough to take to court. Counties and communities also need to be careful about how they write zoning laws and allow for site-specific data to grant variances. Public participation is essential to the success of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. Someone needs to attend the public organization meetings. While it is not feasible for representatives of the DENR to attend every city council meeting, it was suggested that the DENR can enlist assistance of the Rural Water Association and the Water Districts to inform the public. County commissions and the municipal leagues were also suggested. The possibility of including a representative of the Organization of County Commissioners as part of the TAC or other committee was discussed. The DENR anticipates that there will be much confusion between source water assessments, watershed assessments, and TMDLs. The DENR doesn't want the public to think that there are three or more different programs going on at the same time. The TAC discussed incorporating media via press releases. The TAC discussed how to handle water source areas that extend into tribal lands. The State of South Dakota has good relations with most of the tribes. The DENR anticipates that most tribes will be cooperative, noted that the source water assessments should not be performed without their involvement. Discussed the potential need to also include tribal groups in the committees. The DENR will include tribal involvement in the Source Water Assessment Program Work Plan. Source Water Assessment Activities in the Black Hills Foster Sawyer The DENR believes that the Black Hills Hydrology and Water Management Study will provide very useful information for source water assessments. Project completion is scheduled for the year 2000, so the results should be available for use in source water assessments. The information collected is coming into use already. The City of Spearfish is working with DENR to put together a wellhead protection area and is moving forward aggressively. Spearfish has two systems of drinking water: deep aquifers and shallow, unconfined aquifers. There is a need to tailor the assessment approach to the system evaluated. Information such as recharge area locations, sinkhole locations, and water collection areas are needed. A hydrogeologic unit map of Lawrence County has been prepared and presented. The DENR has experienced some problems with overlaying existing data regarding hydrogeologic units over topographic maps: enlarging some maps so that their scales match other maps limits the value of the information. Sensitivity of the maps is not field checked. The DENR again expressed concern that counties may not recognize problems with accuracy of some maps and they may implement zoning restrictions at the field level and potentially taking people to court. Piedmont Valley has spent most of their efforts on private well identification. A vulnerability map is being prepared. The DENR is trying to steer Piedmont Valley towards preparing information that would be useful in future for the performance of source water assessments. A lot of information has been collected and generated, and Piedmont Valley is struggling with presenting data. They may be using GIS. The water supply in Piedmont Valley is actually much larger than most people realize. According to Arden Davis (SD School of Mines and Technology), dye studies at Box Elder suggest that it takes 30 days to get into the Rapid City system. The flow paths within systems may be different and we'll never have exact information on this. The TAC discussed how to perform a potential contaminant source inventory in a large area such as Spearfish. The DENR can look at using prioritized areas and using a sensitivity map. According to Mike Wireman, the EPA would expect less detailed information for the less frequently used transient water sources. The amount of detail requiredAppendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-32would depend on the use of the well. Septic tanks, for example, are difficult to inventory. There probably are many bad septic tanks out there that are unknown of at this time. However, the upcoming disinfection rule will bring this problem to the forefront. All septic tanks fail in 20-25 years. Septic tanks installed in the Black Hills can be in fractured bedrock. Viruses generally have limited viability, but can live in the subsurface for a long time. Perhaps time of travel should be used instead of hydrogeological mapping in areas of fractured bedrock. According to Mike Wireman (EPA), it's better to have a larger source water area to start with. States can then differentially evaluate create subareas. The Black Hills is a complicated system and sensitive area. The TAC discussed meeting with the Piedmont Valley Study Steering Committee and Western Dakota Water District to get a collaborative effort. Instead of delineating small areas, the DENR may wish to treat the Black Hills as a large unit. Summary of Meeting and Agenda (After Lunch Break) Bill Markley Activities this morning: Got concurrence on intended use work plan; Got concurrence on the prioritization scheme; Discussed public participation; and Reviewed specific projects in the Black Hills which may be relevant to the source water assessment program Agenda for this afternoon: Review, in general, what data is already available, what's wrong with available data, and what data needs to be collected, including a presentation of baseline data currently available for presentation via GIS; Discuss the actual end products of the assessments; and Discuss methods to present and disseminate the source water assessment information to the county and communities in format that a layperson can understand. Available Data and Data Collection Tim Cowman and Missy Mathis Mr. Cowman presented a demonstration of digital mapping and how the DENR can incorporate and use digital mapping to make better products. The demonstration showed the utility of using digital base maps and products. The demonstration included a handout that shows the status of information available in GIS to date. There are four digital mapping products: Digital Line Graphs ( and Digital Elevation Models ( DEMs). All of these products are \" georeferenced,\" meaning that they will overlay each other with little manipulation. DLGs: 1:100,000 scale line maps available for the entire state right now. Less coverage is available in 1:24,000 scale for the state. DRGs: Scanned image of topographic maps. 1:24,000 scale maps available for entire state. DOQs: Digital image of aerial photos; there is limited coverage for the state. There is a cur rent effort to raise $1,000,000 to collaborate with the US Geological Survey (USGS) and other agencies to obtain complete coverage. If the funds are successfully raised, the USGS anticipates complete state coverage in 3- 5 years. DEMs: Grid of elevatio n points ; only available for selected areas in the state. DENR has contracted to get some DEMs completed at the end of March - expect the results shortly. The demonstration included a map illustrating the occurrence of surficial aquifer material in the City of Egan in Moody County using ArcView , a GIS software product. Data layers in ArcView are call themes. Layers included elevation contours, political and aquifer boundaries, roads, streams, test holes and wells (from Visual FoxPro database with latitude/longitude location data), surface geology (digitized), and scanned in geologic cross-sections. In ArcView, database information may be viewed by selecting a data point on a map. GIS and databases integrate well when location data is available. Work performed to compile the demonstration included visiting the city's production wells, collecting location information using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment, transferring information from GPS to ArcView. The demonstration included the DOQ (aerial photograph). GPS equipment gives about 1-meter accuracy, with differential correction. The accuracy will vary, depending on the time of day. Using ArcView, users can measure distances while on-screen with a measuring tool.Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-33The demonstration showed that 1:100,000 scale data blown up to 1:12,000 scale can be inaccurate. However, users can perform \"heads up\" digitizing (on-screen adjustment of data on the GIS map) to correct obvious inaccuracies and errors. In the City of Egan, the water table contours show that the aquifer is recharging the Big Sioux River on west side, but that the river is recharging the aquifer into the well field on the east side of the river. The demonstration included a groundwater Zone of Contribution (ZOC) data layer created using hydrogeologic mapping and wellhead protection area delineation techniques and a surface water ZOC created using topographic map and surface water drainage areas. There may be a hydrogeologic connection between each side of the river. The demonstration also included a data layer of potential sources of contamination. The demonstration showed that a user can query for specific data in the GIS system. It also showed the need and ability to double-check accuracy of data by comparing data in DOQs and DRGs. DOQs may show potential contaminant sources which don't show up on topographic maps ( DRGs). DLGs are useful for isolating rivers and querying for contaminant sources within a certain distance to the river. Users can also have GIS software automatically draw buffer zones. The demonstration included nitrate sampling data and how \"hotlinks\" can be created to show graph of time vs. nitrate concentrations for a particular well by selecting the well on a GIS map. The digital mapping products are available to DENR. The products can be made available via a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site or via CD-ROM. The TAC discussed the usefulness of DOQs and the lack of complete DOQ coverage in the state. Complete DOQ coverage is a goal. Even if the $1,000,000 in funds were available now, the DOQs won't be available for the whole state covered in time for the Source Water Assessment Program deadline. Whoever is paying the money decides which DOQ is done first. Satellite imagery is available, but its resolution is not as good as DOQs. The TAC discussed attempting to prioritize DOQ development based on Source Water Assessment Program prioritization. The USGS will want to do contiguous groups of DOQs, so can prioritize mostly on east river. The TAC discussed potential funding resources. The State is trying to facilitate the use of digital mapping products within the state government right now. The next step is to make them available to the public, but that will be further into the future. For source water assessments, the minimum criteria will be 1:100,000 and 1:24,000 scale maps. The DLGs an DRGs are available right now and, at a minimum, will be used in the assessments. DOQs will be used when and where available and perhaps should be presented using the Internet due to length of time required to print DOQs. It was noted that DOQs will not be especially useful in areas using confined aquifers. The TAC discussed the problem that, currently, the DENR Geologic Survey in Vermillion has access to the various DENR program databases in Pierre, but the DENR programs in Pierre don't have access to the Geologic Survey databases in Vermillion. The TAC reviewed the information available in databases within various programs in the DENR. There is a lot of information, but, unfortunately, few of the databases include accurate location data that can be directly imported into a GIS application. Currently, there are several different software programs associated with each database. The DENR is in the process of converting all databases to one software (Visual FoxPro) . The information in the drinking water program databases will be the most important at onset of the source water assessments. The DENR is already gathering GPS location data, but the process is slow. The DENR Water Rights Program database will also be useful for source water area delineations - legal locations in this database have already been converted to latitude/longitude locations using a conversion software program, so there may be some inaccuracies. The Geologic Survey lithologic database will also be useful. Currently, the Groundwater Quality Program spills database is being converted to Visual FoxPro and the registered tanks database is being linked to the spills database. A database of drinking water maximum contaminant level violations is available and may be useful for source water assessments, but the DENR would need to perform additional research regarding the actual location of the high contaminant in the drinking water because sampling occurs at point of entry, not at the source. Other databases that may need to be considered include NPDES databases and agricultural databases. With the databases which are available at the DENR right now, there is much work that needs to be done. The DENR needs to think about how to get the latitude/longitude information into the databases. In addition, thereAppendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-34currently are major bugs in the system (e.g. there is only one phone line to the GPS base station in Pierre for differentially correcting GPS data). The TAC discussed the need to figure out the types of data not in the databases that South Dakota may need to provide. It is currently unclear if the EPA has minimum requirements for the source water assessments. Information regarding septic tanks is not readily available, but it currently is unclear if the EPA would require South Dakota to provide that information. Assad Barari (DENR-Geologic Survey) commented that perhaps South Dakota should include septic tanks in light of the upcoming disinfection rule. The TAC discussed the magnitude of an effort to find septic systems. The disinfection rule will require looking at a two-year time of travel for advective groundwater flow, based on virus viability. The wellhead protection areas were established based on a ten-year time of travel. The TAC discussed the question that, if septic systems will be regulated using a two-year time of travel, should South Dakota use a two-year time of travel for source water assessments? The TAC discussed possibility of looking only at viral viability for 2-year time of travel (recognizing inaccuracies inherent in that) for groundwater source areas which contain known septic systems and ten-year time of travel for all other cases. Mike Wireman commented that that would be a good approach and would, in effect, kill two birds with one stone. Surface water is treated for viral contamination anyway, so South Dakota won't have to consider the upcoming disinfection rule for the surface water supplies. When evaluating a surface water source, South Dakota can ignore viral (septic) sources. Delineation Methods for Ground Water Sources Tom Brandner The DENR is proposing to use wellhead protection area delineation methods previously approved by the EPA for wellhead areas. For vulnerable communities an analytical method would be used if sufficient information is available. If the necessary information is not available for using an analytical method, the DENR proposes to use a calculated or arbitrary fixed-radius until additional information is available. Vulnerable non-transient, noncommunity systems (schools) would be treated the same as vulnerable community water systems (described above). For vulnerable transient, non-community systems (restaurants, campgrounds, motels) and back-up or emergency systems, the DENR is proposing to use a calculated fixed radius or, if insufficient information is available, an arbitrary fixed-radius. For non-vulnerable confined water systems, the DENR is proposing to use a 500-foot radius around the wellhead. The TAC discussed how to standardize assessment methods. The TAC discussed how the WHPA modeling program has been misused: WHPA works fine for unconsolidated sands and gravel, but WHPA is a poor tool for fractured bedrock, confined conditions, etc .. The TAC suggested that South Dakota may want to use hydrogeologic mapping in those instances. WHAM, another groundwater modeling program, is available and is better than WHPA, but it also has limitations. Hydrogeologic data and geographic setting information should be reviewed to determine the method of delineation. Temporal variations in flow will also affect delineated areas. The TAC discussed the need to do some upfront data search of each potential area and decide, based on the available data, which method to use for delineating water source areas. The DENR needs to write up the proposed Source Water Assessment Program document and get EPA approval next year. Due to the short time frame, it behooves South Dakota to start doing delineations as soon as possible. The DENR asked Mike Wireman if there would be a problem with demonstration projects - Mike said that it would be a good idea and suggested selecting the most difficult sites. If the demonstration projects are approved, DENR would consider three sites : one in the Black Hills, Big Sioux River, and a third small community west of the Missouri River. The TAC discussed considering including a community water system that uses surface and ground water. The TAC also discussed the possibility of treating the Big Sioux River Aquifer System as one unit (basin) instead of breaking it up into smaller units based on the individual public water supply systems. If the DENR did use that approach, it would be a massive project. In addition, land developers and landowners may have problems with listing all of the Big Sioux Aquifer into one source water protection area. The TAC discussed the need to have differential source water areas ( subwater shed areas), so that the public water supplier on the lower portion of a source water area doesn't have to protect everything upstream. Colorado has performed demonstration source water assessment pilot projects. Mike Wireman will present those results during the next TAC meeting.Appendix C 1: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , April 1, 1998 A-35The TAC discussed ideas to delineate and protect surface water areas, such as an approach similar to the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) to protect drainages. The TAC discussed the possibility of delineating an entire basin and then establishing a buffer zone with the use of CRP and State Water Revolving Fund monies. Landowners under a buffer zone would be compensated under Clean Water Action Plan. The TAC discussed the need to consider areas in the state where it would make sense to delineate an entire basin. EPA has issued guidance documents on how to deal with large systems which will be provided to the DENR. According to the guidance documents, states can create differential protection via \"segmented watershed approach.\" The TAC discussed the possibility that a large system such as the Missouri River System, despite its size, may not be as difficult to assess as it appears. Smaller, intermittent streams may be more difficult and sensitive. Miscellaneous Topics for Discussion The DENR meets once a month internally. One of the issues brought out during the internal DENR meetings is that location data is not being gathered quickly enough. During the last internal meeting, the DENR had discussed the possibility of contracting out with an entity to collect location data at public water supply wells and intake structure this summer using GPS. Any contract that comes from the DENR requires the Governor's approval. There is a need to ensure that the GPS measurements are consistent between data collectors. So, the DENR is working on common standardized operating procedures for GPS data collection. Also, there is a need to avoid duplication. The TAC discussed the possibility of creating a common database of sites where GPS data has been collected, including a field for noting data collection method, and a comment field for describing collection point. Jay Gilbertson (East Dakota Water Development District) offered to potentially provide funds to perform the public water supply source GPS location data survey. The TAC discussed the need to remember that the end product is something that the community can use. The TAC also discussed the need to obtain public acceptance of this program. For example, there would be a potential need to convince County commissioners that it may be more valuable not to plant a fertilizer-intense crop such as corn to protect the water source. This needs to be done so that we can effect changes in the state. The susceptibility analysis guidance is underway at the EPA and in the fast track. Mike Wireman indicated that he might have a draft available in May. There is a Source Water Protection Conference to be held on April 28 and 29, 1998 in Dallas, Texas. Mike Wireman will be giving a presentation. Schedule Next Meeting Next TAC meeting confirmed for May 28, 1998. July 9 and September 10, 1998 were tentatively scheduled for future TAC meetings. During next meeting, the TAC wants to pinpoint delineation methods for ground and surface water. The DENR will have an outline ready for the Source Water Assessment Plan.A-37Appendix C2 Source Water Assessment Program Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary May 28, 1998 Attendees: Anita Yan SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Tricia Sebes SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Missy Mathis SD DENR-Minerals & Rob Kittay SD Stueven SD DENR-Watershed Protection M.

Rapid City's surface water delineation will not be presented due to computer problems. DENR is contracting with Maxim Technologies, Inc., Eisenbraun & Associates, CETEC Engineering Services, Inc., and First District Association of Local Governments to complete an inventory of the location of wellheads, surface water intakes, pretreatment facilities, treatment plants, pumping facilities, storage facilities, and entry points into distribution systems using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment . The physical condition of all wellheads and intakes will be assessed and a digital photograph will be taken of the wellhead/intake. The land use around all the water supply wells will be recorded (e.g. residential, commercial, industrial, cropland, or pasture). A limited potential contaminant source inventory will be conducted at all nonvulnerable PWSS within a 500-foot radius of the wellhead. The contractor's work will be submitted to DENR weekly; all work will be completed by September 30, 1998. Delineation Methods for Ground Water Systems Tricia Sebes The DENR proposed delineating a 500-foot radius around all nonvulnerable PWSS. Nonvulnerable systems are those determined nonvulnerable in the 1991 South Dakota PWSS Vulnerability Study. There are approximately 150 nonvulnerable systems in South Dakota. All vulnerable systems include systems mapped in shallow aquifers, all systems determined vulnerable in the 1991 South Dakota PWSS Vulnerability Study , and all systems with unknown vulnerability.Appendix C 2: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , May 28, 1998 A-38The DENR proposed using the calculated fixed radius method for Transient, Non-Community (TNC) Systems. These systems include campgrounds, restaurants, and motels. South Dakota has approximately 250 TNC systems. Depending on the availability hydrogeologic data, a more advanced delineation method may be used, such as hydrogeologic mapping. The DENR proposed using the calculated fixed radius method for all back-up wells or emergency wells. This includes systems that are served by other systems. Delineation methods for PWSS in the Black Hills will be determined at a later date. The DENR and USGS are currently working on mapping geology and hydrology of the Black Hills area to develop an aquifer sensitivity map to assist in developing source water delineation zones. Differential sensitivity may lead to differential protection zones. A maximum effort will be applied to all other vulnerable, community and non-transient non-community PWSS (schools, factories). This will include a combination of hydrogeologic mapping and analytical methods. The DENR is compiling \"informational packets\" of the available data for all public water supply systems which will include the following: location of PWSS, geologic logs, observation well data, water level information, hydrogeologic studies, well construction information, licensed or permitted pumping rate of the well, and water quality data. The TAC discussed the availability of adequate data available to complete the assessments using the proposed methods. Most counties in the eastern portion of the state have completed county and sand & gravel studies. Delineation Methods for Surface Water Systems Tricia Sebes The DENR proposed Surface Water Delineation Methods for the 41PWSS in the state. The EPA requires the entire watershed upstream of the PWS intake structure be delineated up to the next PWS intake or to the state boarder. The DENR proposed using USGS 8-digit hydrologic unit codes (HUC) to delineate the surface water systems . Three maps will be presented to the public. The first map will include an illustration of the entire watershed in which the PWSS is located (figure 1); the second map will include an illustration of the entire watershed upstream of the PWS intake (figure 2); and the third map will include a detailed delineation of the PWS critical watershed area (figures 3- 7). The DENR proposed a Watershed Delineation area which included 3 zones of protection. Zone A included the area in the watershed out to 5 miles beyond the PWSS intake. A complete contaminant source inventory would be conducted in this area. Zone B would include a 0.5-mile contaminant inventory strip (CSI) along both sides of stream, out to 5 miles beyond Zone A. A complete contaminant source inventory would be conducted in the 0.5- mile CSI strip, and large potential contaminant sources, such as large feedlot operations and landfills, would be inventoried outside of 0.5-mile strip. Zone C would include the remaining delineated watershed. Only large potential contaminant sources will be inventoried in this area. The DENR presented various scenarios for the following: a watershed delineation for a river or stream, a watershed delineation for multiple PWS intakes in one watershed, two watershed delineations for a dam, lake, or reservoir, and a conjunctive delineation. These figures are shown below.Appendix C 2: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , May 28, 1998 A-39 Figure 3: Watershed Delineation for River/ Stream Figure 4: Watershed Delineation for River or Figure 5:Watershed Delineation for Stream with Multiple PWS Inta kes Dam/Lake/Reservoir Watershed Delineation for a Lake Figure 7: Conjunctive Delineation The TAC had concerns about using the 8-digit HUC codes. This information is based on a 1978 USGS publication. Updated watershed maps for the James River, Vermillion River, Big Sioux River, and Minnesota and Red Rivers are available. The question was raised whether the 5 mile Zone A and Zone B are \"river miles\" or the distance from the PWS intake. The TAC would rather use river miles. In situations where the river channel is wider than the buffer zone, the TAC suggested widening the buffer to include the flood plain. The TAC discussed the need for additional protection downgradient of the PWS intake for infiltration galleries. It was also mentioned that an entirely different delineation approach would have to be used for the Black Hills area. The TAC suggested using the time of travel method to delineate the surface water systems. It was noted that this method would be useful if the purpose of the delineation is to inform the public water supply operator of a contamination spill. However, it will depend on the contaminant spilled; contaminants travel at different rates. A simple calculation of gradient can be used to estimate time of travel for each system. Considering the time constraints by EPA to complete this program, other members of the committee felt the DENR proposed method is a good start to the delineations, and once more information for each system is known - such as time of travel and potential contaminant sources - a more advanced, detailed method may be used. The TAC questioned if the 5-mile fixed radius method was overprotective in areas without aquifer material. A different method for delineating surface water systems was proposed by the TAC. This method also includes 3 zones of protection. Zone A would extend 0.5 miles beyond the aquifer, out to 5 river miles beyond the PWSS intake. A complete contaminant source inventory would be conducted in this area. Zone B would extend 0.25 miles beyond the aquifer, out to 5 river miles beyond Zone A. A complete contaminant source inventory would be conducted in Zone B. Zone C would include the remaining delineated watershed. Only large potential contaminant sources will be inventoried in this area, such as large feedlot operations and landfills. If an aquifer is not present, Zone A would extend 0.5 miles beyond the river/stream, out to 5 miles beyond the PWS intake; Zone B would extend 0.25 miles beyond the river/stream, out to 5 miles beyond Zone A; and Zone C would include the rest of the watershed. The figure below illustrates the revised surface water delineation method.Appendix C 2: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , May 28, 1998 A-40 Revised Surface Water Delineation Method It was suggested that Zone C include a 100 foot buffer outside of the aquifer, or at a minimum, include the mapped aquifer . Other members of the TAC felt Zone C is not a concern, at least from the Big Sioux aquifer standpoint, due to the 10-mile distance upstream of the PWS intake. It was suggested that, in the Black Hills wider buffers, such as 1 mile in Zone A and 0.5 miles in Zone B, may have to be used due to the higher gradients and varied topography. The TAC discussed the average widths of aquifers and the availability of aquifer information to complete the delineations. It was noted that the Big Sioux aquifer (BSA) is 5 miles wide between Volga and Brookings, and there are not many surface water systems outside the BSA. The surface outwash aquifers are well defined in the BSA region. Contaminant Source Inventory Discussion Missy Mathis The DENR presented the list of potential contaminant sources (PCS) that the GPS contractors will be using this summer to inventory PCS at non-vulnerable systems. A detailed list of potential contaminant sources, taken from Appendix 4 of the SD Wellhead Protection Program Document, was also discussed. When inventorying potential contaminant sources at vulnerable systems, the DENR proposed using existing databases, and will field check data if time allows and money is available. The DENR will also be asking all public water supply operators to conduct a contaminant source inventory with the department's guidance. Data from the department's databases will be sent to PWSS operator to update and/or correct, and a topographic map will be sent to them to map potential sources of contamination. The DENR databases include all Tier 2 facilities, permitted animal feeding lot operations, wastewater treatment facilities, underground storage tanks, aboveground storage tanks, and spills. The DENR will be developing a database to keep track of all potential contaminant sources recorded this summer when inventorying nonvulnerable PWSS. The TAC would like to include highways as a potential contaminant source. The TAC questioned whether quarries should be included as a potential contaminant source. It was decided to include quarries because they are an exposed area and a \"window\" to the aquifer. In some cases, an abandoned quarry many become a landfill. The question was raised whether or not all sizes of grain storage bins will be included as a potential contaminant source. It was noted that if the facility stores chemicals and/or it is included in the Tier 2 database, it will be considered a potential contaminant source . The TAC inquired whether or not abandoned landfills will be included as a potential contaminant source. It was noted that older landfills were used to burn waste; therefore, these landfills may not contain many contaminants. The TAC inquired how septic systems will be inventoried. Septic systems will be assumed in areas where sewer systems and wastewater treatment plants do not exist. The TAC discussed what should be considered a \"major\" potential contaminant source. It was decided that major sources are relative to the size of the operation and aquifer in which the PWSS is located. The Sioux Falls airport will be considered a major source in the Sioux Falls wellfield.Appendix C 2: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary , May 28, 1998 A-41Discussion of Draft Outline of the Source Water Document Tricia S ebes The TAC did not have any comments on the draft SWAP outline. Miscellaneous Topics for Discussion The TAC discussed holding an additional meeting to discuss Black Hill delineation methods and contaminant source inventory methods. This meeting will be held in room 222 of the Mineral Industries Building at the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology in Rapid City. The following people will be attending and/or will be invited to attend: SDGS: Foster Sawyer, Derric Iles, Stan Pence, Tim Mike Wireman US BOR: Jeff Williamson SDSM&T: Arden Davis, Bruce Berdanier, Scott Kenner Dakota Cty: Marcis Elkins Schedule Next Meeting Initially, the next TAC meeting was scheduled for July 9th; however, this meeting was rescheduled to August 18th and will be held over the RDT Network in Pierre, Rapid City, and Sioux Falls. Topics of discussion include: susceptibility determination, implementation of SWAP program, and a draft of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Document will be presented.A-43Appendix C3 Source Water Assessment Program Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary July 21, 1998 Attendees: Anita Yan SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Tom Brandner SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Tricia Sebes SD DENR-Ground Water Quality M.

The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is a result of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act which requires all states to complete assessments for all public water supply systems. There are approximately 760 PWSS in South Dakota. The focus of the meeting is to specifically address delineation methods for the Black Hills region. Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Overview Tricia Sebes Source Water Protection is a pollution prevention measure that focuses on protecting the area surrounding public drinking water supplies. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments allows states to set aside up to 10% of the fiscal 1997 Drinking Water State Revolving Funds; requires states to develop a Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP); and requires states to complete source water assessments for all public water supply systems. A complete Source Water Assessment Program Document will describe how South Dakota will accomplish the following: involve the public, approach to the assessments, distribute assessment information to the public, and implement the program.Appendix C 3: Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary, July 21, 1998 A-44Public Participation includes forming a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and Citizen Advisory Committee (CAC). The TAC consists of representatives from most DENR Programs and representatives of outside agency and organizations. The CAC consists of the Board of Water Management and the Board of Water and Natural Resources. General public involvement will include holding public meetings across the state to gather input on the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. The approach to the assessments for ground water systems includes using delineation methods in accordance with South Dakota's Wellhead Protection Program. Delineations for surface water systems include the entire watershed upstream of any public water supply intakes or diversion structures up to the South Dakota border. A contaminant source inventory must be conducted within the delineated area. A susceptibility analysis of all potential contaminant sources must also be conducted in the delineated area. The assessment information in the form of maps generated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) will be distributed to the public. This information may be made available to the public through the Internet (via the DENR and EPA homepage), at public water supply offices, and/or through water bill inserts. The SWAP document must be submitted to EPA by February 1999; EPA has 9 months to review document; South Dakota has 2 years to complete 760 assessments, 1.5-year extension may be granted. Completed activities: The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) has convened in April and May. The TAC concurred with the DENR's proposed delineation methods for ground water and surface water systems outside of the Black Hills region DENR is contracting with Maxim Technologies, Inc., Eisenbraun & Associates, CETEC Engineering Services, Inc., and First District Association of Local Governments to complete an inventory of the location of wellheads, surface water intakes, pretreatment facilities, treatment plants, pumping facilities, storage facilities, and entry points into distribution systems using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. This work will be completed by September 30, 1998. On-going activities include developing susceptibility criteria, gathering public input into the program, drafting the SWAP document for submittal to EPA. Hydrogeologic Setting of the Black Hills Region Foster Sawyer A summary of the hydrogeologic setting of the Black Hills region was presented. The Black Hills represent an uplifted area with crystalline rocks in the central core, and sandstone, limestone, and shale on the flanks of the uplift. Sedimentary formations on the flanks of the Black Hills, such as the Madison, Minnelusa, and Inyan Kara aquifers, dip away from the central core and plunge into the subsurface at the perimeter of the uplift where they are utilized as ground water sources. Other major sources of ground water in the Black Hills include saturated crystalline rocks in the central core and shallow alluvial deposits throughout the region. One of the most significant aspects of the hydrology of the Black Hills region is the direct connection between water flowing at the land surface and the highly permeable formations, such as the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers, over which it flows. In this setting water can flow directly into cavernous, fractured limestone through sinkholes located along major streams. Once water has entered the cavernous limestone, it can move down-gradient, within the span of a few weeks, to wellheads on the flanks of the Black Hills where it is produced and consumed. Flow pathways within these limestone aquifers are complex and poorly understood, posing unique challenges to the design of an assessment or wellhead protection program in this setting. Proposed Conjunctive Delineation Methods for the Black Hills Foster Sawyer The direct connection between surface and ground water and the rapid ground water flow rates in large carbonate aquifers in the Black Hills require conjunctive delineation methods to adequately assess these source water areas. The 10 year time of travel (TOT) standard used for delineating ground water systems in eastern South Dakota is not appropriate for systems in the Black Hills which can have travel times in the range of a few days to a few weeks from recharge to consumption. In addition, given the complexity of subsurface flow in this setting, it is not possibleAppendix C 3: Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary, July 21, 1998 A-45to accurately delineate all ground water flow paths, and source water areas overlap throughout the Black Hills region. Therefore, a holistic approach to source water assessments in the Black Hills is recommended in order to encompass the many interconnected hydrologic processes affecting the source of local ground water supplies. The recommended approach is to consider the entire Black Hills uplift as a single, hydrologically interconnected area, and to concentrate assessment efforts in aquifer recharge areas for large sensitive aquifers, such as the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers, and along all perennial streams within the Black Hills. These hydrologically sensitive areas will be delineated as Assessment Area A, and they will receive a comprehensive contaminant source inventory (CSI). Other portions of the Black Hills that do not occur in these recharge and perennial stream areas will be delineated as Assessment Area C, and they will be subject to a limited contaminant source inventory only. Examples of the proposed approach were presented for a confined system in the Madison aquifer, an unconfined aquifer in alluvium and an unconfined aquifer in fractured crystalline rock. Confined systems in the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers: The Black Hills delineation method for confined systems in the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers will utilize hydrogeologic mapping in conjunction with perennial streams upgradient from the recharge areas . The example illustrated was for a confined Madison well in Rapid City. Watersheds which have a possibility of contributing water to Rapid City's wellfield were delineated, as were the Madison and Minnelusa recharge areas upgradient from Rapid City . In addition, in accordance with South Dakota's Wellhead Protection Program, a 500 foot fixed radius around the wellhead was also included in the delineated source water area. Assessment area A for the comprehensive CSI will include the Madison and Minnelusa aquifer recharge areas within the zone of ground water contribution (ZOC) to the public water supply well. Also included in Assessment Area A are strips of land that extend 0.25 miles from each stream bank along perennial streams. Assessment Area C for the major CSI will consist of all areas not included in Assessment Area A. To keep assessment categories consistent with source water delineation methods outside of the Black Hills region, an \"Assessment Area B\" was not utilized. Unconfined aquifers in alluvium: An example of a public water supply system located in an alluvial deposit in the central Black Hills was illustrated. Assessment Area A for the comprehensive CSI will consist of a 0.25 mile arbitrary fixed radius around the wellhead and a 0.25 mile assessment area on each side of the stream or alluvium, whichever is greater, for the entire length of the stream. If headwater springs discharge from carbonate aquifers upgradient from the public water supply, then the recharge areas for these springs will also be included within Assessment Area A. Areas not lying within Assessment Area A, but that may be within the ZOC of the water supply, will fall within Assessment Area C and will receive a limited CSI. A few public water supply systems on the perimeter of the Black Hills have infiltration galleries that induce flow from a stream into a collection gallery. In these cases, a 0.25-mile inventory area on each side of the stream will be utilized in conjunction with recharge areas for resurgent springs upgradient from the infiltration gallery. Unconfined aquifers in fractured Precambrian rock: An example of a public water supply located in fractured crystalline rock in the central Black Hills was illustrated. Assessment Area A for the comprehensive CSI will include a 0.25 mile arbitrary fixed radius around the wellhead, as well as a 0.25-mile inventory area along each side of the stream, up to the headwaters of the stream. If headwater springs discharge from carbonate aquifers upgradient from the public water supply, then the recharge areas for these springs will also be included within Assessment Area A. If information concerning ground water flow direction within local fractures is available, it will be used to adjust the delineation of the assessment area around the wellhead. Areas not lying within Assessment Area A, but that may be within the ZOC of the water supply will fall within Assessment Area C and will receive a limited CSI. Discussion The stakeholders (Black Hills Group-BHG) invited to attend this meeting discussed a variety of topics including: information available to conduct the assessments, using a time of travel delineation method, conducting a contaminant source inventory, and involving local communities in the source water program.Appendix C 3: Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary, July 21, 1998 A-46Information Available to Conduct Assessments The USGS Black Hills Hydrology Study maps and Dr. Arden Davis' vulnerability map of Rapid City will be useful in completing the assessments for this region. Time-of-Travel Delineation Method The BHG questioned why travel times of streams are not being used to delineate watersheds, many studies are based on time of travel methods . A handout describing use of GIS to calculate travel times in Wales, England was distributed illustrating differential velocities, travel times, and linear storage of water in watersheds. Subwatersheds are delineated and can be corrected based on ground checking. It was noted this method could be used in the Black Hills region. The USGS indicated a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) can be used to determine the watershed areas that contribute water to streams, and therefore, which streams are contributing to the PWSS. The stream coverage map is a part of the Black Hills Hydrology Study. Thirty-meter DEMs are available in the Black Hills region. The practicality of using the time of travel as a delineation method was questioned. The travel times in the Black Hills area may be too fast to accurately utilize protection measures. The public will be most interested in how these differential travel times will affect their individual system. Time of travel calculations and resources can be concentrated zones that are most critical. If the zones are prioritized, more precision may be brought to the time of travel method. It was noted that due to time and money limitations, utilizing the time of travel method may not be practical. The BHG noted that if the proposed delineation method considers all Black Hills PWSS to be vulnerable, the public may dismiss the source water program as being too overwhelming and hard to manage. However, if more vulnerable areas are segregated from less vulnerable areas, the source water program may be easier to manage, and therefore, more likely to be accepted/implemented. A detailed contaminant source inventory may also not be practical due to the time and money difficulties; there is a limit to what can be accomplished in this phase of the source water program. Contaminant Source Inventory (CSI) The BHG asked if the information from the DENR/SDSM&T abandoned mine study will be used in the contaminant source inventory. The data from this study has location information and therefore can be used in a Geographical Information System (GIS). Approximately 2/3 of the abandoned mining facilities are on private land and may be difficult to access for field verification. The BHG noted that the state can conduct a contaminant source inventory in a broad area; however, communities must be involved in order to refine the assessments . The state should be involved with the communities to find out individual needs. The BHG questioned how individual communities can control/limit upstream potential sources of contamination that are outside of their jurisdiction. Communities will have to work together to protect the watershed areas and manage potential pollution activities. The BHG was concerned about potential pollution activities occurring in watersheds upstream of PWS intake that systems may not know about or be able to manage. If known undesirable activities are occurring in the watershed, communication is needed in order to manage the watershed and communication is needed for advanced warning between PWSS operators to protect their respective water supplies if harmful situations exist. The BHG asked what is considered to be a potential source of contamination. The potential pollution list presented at previous meetings was shown. Facility owners of potential pollution sources will not be identified. The BHG suggested adding \"sediment\" to the contaminant source inventory list. The BHG suggested utilizing a \"tiered\" approach when conducting the assessments, concentrating the contaminant source inventory in the higher priority areas. The BHG indicated that many contaminant sources may fall outside of the 0.25 mile assessment area. There is an explosion of development in the Black Hills area and most of these developments have septic systems. A lot of theseAppendix C 3: Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary, July 21, 1998 A-47septic systems will most likely fall in the Zone C assessment area. All septic systems may not be inventoried; however, relative densities of septic systems may be noted. The BHG discussed how far upstream of the PWS intake should the 0.25-mile CSI area along a stream terminate, and if the inventory area should include perennial streams only. It was noted that a preliminary run with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) would show all tributaries. A computer-modeling program can show the number of drainages, indicating if there are too many in the assessment area to delineate. The stream orders are based on precipitation; there are 3,000 miles of perennial streams in the Black Hills. The BHG questioned if the contaminant source inventory will include non-point sources of pollution. The use of land at all public water supply systems will be noted during the Global Positioning System (GPS) survey being conducted at all PWSS in the state this summer. Land uses include rangeland, pastureland, cropland, grassland, residential, industrial, commercial, and municipal. The BHG suggested land ownership be considered in the contaminant source inventory. Private land should be classified as having potential for development and undeveloped land should be identified as having the potential for future development. Government lands may not need as much protection. The percentage of private land verses government land in watersheds is available through the US Forest Service. Community Involvement in the Source Water Program The BHG asked if purpose of the assessments is to inform the public water supply operator of a contamination spill. The purpose and goal of the Source Water Program is to have a tool for management of watersheds and create a map of the assessment areas that will educate the public. Individual communities in the BH area should take a regional view of all PWSS since their source water areas are interconnected. Individual assessment of the 300 PWSS in the BH area will not be effective because of the interconnection between PWSS source water areas and watersheds. The BHG inquired how the state will involve the communities . The BHG suggested that the DENR prepare a demonstration for the public water supply systems illustrating a generic source water watershed delineation to educate public officials and citizens on the source water program. The BHG inquired how the source water protection program can be take to the next level. The Black Hills regional approach will be presented to the local governments. The local governments can manage their water supplies by working with county governments to form countywide ordinances to protect water supplies. For example, in the Big Sioux region, ten counties have county aquifer protection ordinances. The BHG inquired what a source water assessment output will entail; and asked whether all communities would have a delineated map. Because the most sensitive portion of the Black Hills will be protected, many of the public water supply system delineations will overlap. The BHG questioned the usefulness of the final DENR assessment for individual communities. Will the state conduct a minimal assessment to meet the SDWA deadline and with the limited amount funds available, $1.25 million dollars? The BHG would like to understand the assessment methods to see how their community may need to supplement the assessment data. The state will gather all existing data, use available resources and present the assessment to the communities. The assessments most likely will not be as detailed as individual communities may want; however, the assessment will be a stepping stone to start a source water protection program. The BHG has concerns that using the 0.25-mile fixed radius may hinder community efforts to create local ordinances. Citizens may see this fixed number as \"set in stone\" and may be unwilling to adjust this distance for source water and possibly future regulations, such as septic system setback distances. The city of Spearfish is using a method similar to that proposed by the DENR to delineate their wellhead protection area. Surface Water Delineation Methods for non-Black Hills PWSS Tr icia Sebes The watershed boundary would be used to delineate the surface water source area. The proposed surface water delineation method for non-Black Hills PWSS includes 3 zones of PCS inventory prioritization. Zone A would extend 0.5 miles beyond the aquifer, out to 5 river miles beyond the PWSS intake. A complete contaminant sourceAppendix C 3: Black Hills Delineation Methods Meeting Summary, July 21, 1998 A-48inventory would be conducted in this area. Zone B would extend 0.25 miles beyond the aquifer, out to 5 river miles beyond Zone A. A complete contaminant source inventory would be conducted in Zone B. Zone C would include the remaining delineated watershed. Only large potential contaminant sources will be inventoried in this area, such as large feedlot operations and landfills. If an aquifer is not present, Zone A would extend 0.5 miles beyond the river/stream, out to 5 miles beyond the PWS intake; Zone B would extend 0.25 miles beyond the river/stream, out to 5 miles beyond Zone A; and Zone C would include the rest of the watershed. The figure below illustrates the proposed surface water delineation method. Proposed Surface Water Delineation Method for non-Black Hills PWSS Conclusion Anita Yan The DENR asked the BHG to concur with the proposed delineation method for the Black Hills region. The BHG indicated the generalized method is probably the best approach for most communities because of the interconnection between watersheds. Thank you for participating in this very important meeting.A-49Appendix C 4 Source Water Assessment Program Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary October 1, 1998 Attendees: Bill Markley SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Anita Yan SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Tom Brandner SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Tricia Sebes SD DENR-Ground Water Quality Missy Mathis SD DENR-Minerals SD DENR-Drinking Water M.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP) draft document. The susceptibility portion of the document is not included. The DENR has been anticipating an EPA guidance document on conducting a susceptibility analysis for potential contaminant sources in assessment areas. DENR will present the proposed susceptibility analysis method at this meeting. Chapter 1: Introduction to the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Tom Brandner The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) did not have comments on the Executive Summary or Chapter 1 of the document. Chapter 2: Public Participation and Outreach Tricia Sebes The DENR presented the role the public has had in the development of the SWAP. Public involvement includes establishing a technical advisory committee, citizens advisory committee, interested party mailing list, holding a public meeting on the program, presenting SWAP information at workshops and seminars, and including SWAP information in newsletters and publications.Appendix C 4: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 1, 1998 A-50The TAC voiced concerns that the DENR is not adequately informing the water systems, cities, and general public about the SWAP program. The citizens advisory committee consisting of the Board of Water and Natural Resources and the Water Management Board are not adequately representing the public. The DENR noted that the citizens board meetings are open to the public and an agenda is published indicating SWAP information will be discussed at meetings. The DENR has also informed public water supply system operators at numerous workshops on SWAP, and has offered to speak to any group or organization on the source water program. The DENR has also sent SWAP information to owner/operators and mayors of all community and nontransient noncommunity public water supply systems in the state. The DENR has had little or no response to these efforts. The DENR will send a SWAP executive summary and an invitation to attend the SWAP draft document public meeting to approximately 1,000 individuals and organizations on the Department mailing list. The SWAP draft document will also be sent to any persons who request a copy. This information will be added to the public participation portion of the document. The TAC indicated the Rural Water System publishes quarterly newsletters in which SWAP information could be published. Newspapers are another avenue where SWAP information can be distributed to a wide audience. The DENR will look into using these public outreach mechanisms. The TAC questioned how the Tribes will be informed concerning the SWAP program. The DENR holds semiannually meetings with the Tribes informing them on environmental issues. The next meeting this fall will focus on the source water assessment program. The DENR is not required to delineate source water assessment areas for tribal water supply systems. However, the DENR will conduct an assessment at the request of Tribes. The Tribes may use the assessment approach established by the DENR or another assessment approach. Federal funds are available for the Tribes to develop a SWAP program. The Oglala-Sioux Tribe has received $50,000 to conduct assessments. Other Tribes may have received or applied for funds also. The TAC suggested adding information concerning the Black Hills Delineation Methods meeting to the public participation portion of the document. This meeting was held in July 1998 and discussed Black Hills source water issues. Local stakeholders including city and county officials attended this meeting. Chapter 3: Source Water Assessment Approach Tricia Sebes The DENR presented a summary the source water assessment approach for both ground water and surface water systems. Non-Black Hills Assessment Approach The EPA suggested defining the following terms in the draft document: vulnerability, sensitivity, and susceptibility. The EPA defines sensitivity as the inherent hydrogeologic characteristics of the water supply. Vulnerability is a function of the sensitivity and the sources of contamination, and susceptibility is a measure of risk defined by the inherent characteristics of the water supply and the sources of contamination. The EPA indicated a 2-4 page ASTM guide on conducting ground water sensitivity and vulnerability assessments is available. This guide clearly defines vulnerability, sensitivity, and susceptibility. EPA will provide the DENR a copy of this guide; the DENR will distribute this guide to the TAC upon request. In order to minimize the area of Zone A in surface water assessments, the EPA suggests clarifying the draft document to read \"(Zone A extends) laterally 0.25 miles beyond each stream bank or alluvial aquifer boundary\". The TAC questioned what delineation method will be used to assess Lake Oahe. Lake Oahe will be delineated using the assessment approach for a river or stream. When conducting assessments for public water supply systems located near the dam, such as Mini Wiconi, the assessment area will extend 10 miles upstream of the public water supply intake, extending beyond the dam. Due to the large amount of surface area in the Missouri River watershed basin, the EPA suggested limiting the extent of Zone B in this area. The EPA does not expect large multi-river states to conduct a detailed assessment in large river basins. Currently, Zone B in this area includes the entire watershed beyond Zone A. The TAC discussed reducing Zone B to a radius extending beyond Zone A, possibly 25 miles. A large portion of the Missouri River will be eliminated if this new method is applied. A geographical information system (GIS) can be used to easily estimate the portions of the Missouri River that will not be included in the assessment area.Appendix C 4: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 1, 1998 A-51The TAC noted the revised approach may not be appropriate for smaller watershed areas, such as the Big Sioux River and James River watershed basins. There is not enough water in these systems to dilute the water if a major problem would occur, unlike the Missouri River watershed basin. Black Hills Assessment Approach Public water supply systems located in confined aquifers in the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers will be delineated using a 500-foot arbitrary fixed radius around the wellhead. The recharge areas for these wells, located in the Madison and Minnelusa aquifers, will also be delineated. The EPA asked if it is possible to have a confined aquifer in the vulnerable Zone A Madison and Minnelusa recharge areas. The EPA is concerned that a public water supply owner/operators having a confined well in this sensitive area will only want to protect the minimum 500-foot radius around the wellfield, rather than the entire Zone A sensitive area. The EPA would like the draft document to clarify that confined wells located in the Zone A recharge area will need to utilize protection measures beyond the 500-foot arbitrary fixed radius . The DENR indicated that any well located in the Zone A recharge area will not be delineated using an arbitrary fixed radius, rather, the entire recharge area will be delineated due to the sensitive nature of the aquifer; the DENR will clarify this issue in the draft document. The TAC suggested including additional aquifers as potential recharge areas such as the Inyan Kara and Minnekahta aquifers. The latest information from the Black Hills Hydrology Study , including all information on recharge areas, will be used to delineate source water areas in the Black Hills region. The EPA indicated the 0.25-mile arbitrary fixed radius assessment area around fractured Precambrian bedrock wells may not be adequate due to the complexity of fractures and ground water/surface water interaction in these areas. The EPA typically does not recommend using an arbitrary fixed radius for this geologic setting; rather they would suggest using hydrogeologic mapping methods. The EPA recommended using hydrogeologic mapping for community systems and increasing the 0.25-mile arbitrary fixed radius for noncommunity systems. The DENR indicated the orientation on the fractures in these areas is usually unknown; therefore, it is very difficult to use hydrogeologic mapping methods. The TAC suggested the 0.25-mile assessment area along the stream banks should also be increased due to the highly fractured nature of these areas. The TAC noted that most development in the Black Hills region does not extend 0.25 miles beyond the stream bank. The DENR is considering increasing the 0.25-mile arbitrary fixed radius to 0.5-mile arbitrary fixed radius. The EPA noted that increasing the assessment area in fractured Precambrian public water supply systems most likely will not increase the workload for conducting a potential contaminant source inventory due to the lack of development in these areas. However, these areas should be considered Zone A for management purposes. The public should be aware that these are hydrogeologically sensitive areas and developing these areas may be harmful to the water supply. The source water program is a proactive program and needs to prevent potential problems that may arise in the future. Contaminant Source Inventory Discussion The DENR presented the contaminant source inventory method that will be used in source water assessment areas. The DENR will use a \"comprehensive\" potential contaminant source inventory (CSI) in Zone A assessment areas. A comprehensive CSI includes using existing data from DENR and outside agency databases. A \"limited\" potential CSI, conducted in Zone B assessment areas, will include regulated facilities, facilities suspected of contaminant release, or major nonpoint contaminant sources. The DENR will ask for the assistance of public water supply operators to verify potential contaminant sources in assessment areas. As time and money allow, field verification of contaminant sources will be conducted. The TAC questioned the differences between a \"comprehensive\" and \"limited\" potential CSI. Both inventories will include information from existing databases. There may not be databases for potential contaminant source that may pose a problem, such as septic tanks. The TAC and EPA recommend field-verifying Zone A assessment areas for vulnerable public water supply systems. The DENR will request assistance from all public water supply systems operators by providing the operators with the delineated area and asking them to verify the potential contaminant source in the delineated area. A potential CSI has been completed for all nonvulnerable public water supply systems within a 500-foot arbitrary fixed radius around the wellhead through field verification.Appendix C 4: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 1, 1998 A-52The TAC questioned if DENR and outside agency databases contain information on the condition of the potential contaminant sources. This information is needed in order to conduct a susceptibility analysis. The EPA suggested conducting a pilot assessment project using information in the existing databases, and field verifying the assessment areas to indicate the accuracy of the databases. This project will show which areas of the contaminant source inventory will need additional effort. A detailed contaminant source inventory, including on-site interviews, is already being conducted at the city of Volga wellhead protection area. The DENR can compare the results of this study with the results of a database search and make changes to the contaminant source inventory portion of the SWAP based on these results. However, the results of this study may not be available in the timeframe needed to complete the source water assessment document. Given the EPA deadline to complete assessments for all public water supply systems, there will not be enough time to complete site visits at potential contaminant facilities. Therefore, when conducting a windshield survey or database search, a determination can be made of which sites may need an on-site visit to obtain additional information for the susceptibility determination . Limited field verification can also be conducted when the drinking water program conducts sanitary surveys. Surveys are conducted every three years for community systems and every five years for noncommunity systems. Chapter 4: Distributing Assessment Information to the Public Missy Mathis The DENR presented the procedure for making assessment information available to the public. Assessment information will be made available in both paper and electronic format. Digital raster graphs (1:24,000 topographic maps) and digital line graphs maps (1:100,000) are available for the entire state. Digital orthophotoquarterquads (1:12,000 aerial photo) will be used where available. All assessments will be linked to EPA's Surf Your Watershed and Envirofacts Internet web page and the DENR's web page. A hard copy will also be sent to all public water supply operators asking assistance in conducting contaminant source inventories. The final assessment will be sent to all town mayors and/or owners of public water supply systems. Potential pollution sources will be identified as a number or symbol rather than by color ensuring the assessments will be understandable if reproduced in black and white format. Environmental Services Research Institute, Inc. (ESRI) has free software available to allow users to download maps on the Internet. The TAC was concerned of what information will be made available to the public. The goal of the source water program is to make the public aware of the source and quality of their water on a regular basis. Therefore, information, such as the facility owner, is not necessary in the final assessment. Land ownership changes frequently, requiring assessments be updated more than necessary. DENR verified that facility ownership will not be presented in the final assessment report. Chapter 5: Implementation of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Anita Yan The deadline to complete the final Source Water Assessment and Protection Program document is February 6, 1999. The DENR has 2 years to complete the assessments and will ask for an 18-month extension. The DENR will use as many existing wellhead protection delineations as possible, and is working with the Rural Water Association to ensure their assessments are compatible with the source water assessment program. The DENR has been working with states in EPA Region VIII by participating in monthly conference calls. The DENR will work with communities to implement and update protection programs. Even though it is not specifically required, the EPA suggested adding a strategy on how South Dakota will implement the source water protection program. The TAC indicated that cities do not have the tools to implement the program. Currently, it is not possible to manage water sources outside a 3-mile jurisdictional boundary beyond the incorporated city limits. It was suggested to ask assistance from the state legislature to help manage source water areas. Susceptibility Discussion Anita Yan The EPA is working on a guidance document for states on how to conduct a susceptibility analysis for potential contaminants in source water areas. The document is approximately 12 pages and discusses case studies other states have used to complete the analysis; this document will be available in a few weeks.Appendix C 4: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 1, 1998 A-53The EPA recommends the following guiding principals when proposing a susceptibility determination: the susceptibility analysis must be consistent statewide. anyone can use the susceptibility determination method and receive the same results the state or an outside entity should perform the susceptibility analysis the susceptibility analysis does not lead to arbitrary conclusions the results of the susceptibility analysis will lead to protection measures and allow local governments to prioritize source water issues The DENR conceptual susceptibility approach is loosely modeled after the Hazard Ranking System, a scoring system used by EPA's Superfund program to assess the relative threat associated with actual and potential releases of hazardous substances from a site. Each site will be assigned a score based on sensitivity and risk factors including aquifer characteristics, distance to well, and background or pre-existing contaminant concentrations. South Dakota's susceptibility analysis will generate site scores based on the threat of the potential contaminant source to the specific drinking water source. The individual factors will be evaluated and the factor values will be combined mathematically to produce factor category values. The site score (S) which represents the susceptibility of the public water supply system to an individual potential contaminant source, will be obtained by combining the ground ( Sgw) and surface ( Ssw) water pathway scores using the root-mean-square equation shown below. Under this equation, higher scoring pathways have a greater relative impact on the overall site score than lower scoring pathways. ()()SS Sgw sw =+2 2 2 The TAC noted there may be a need to have a susceptibility score for the whole public water supply system. The DENR indicated there may also be a need to include a conflict resolution clause in the draft document to deal with potential disputes between the DENR and facility owners. The susceptibility analysis will hopefully encourage facility owners to examine their operations for potential problems. If there is not enough information to conduct a susceptibility analysis, the TAC suggested a worse case scenario be assumed for all facilities; however, it should be clearly noted in the public water supply written report that the susceptibility determination is based on uncertainty. The EPA suggested using the existing 1991 SD Public Water Supply System Vulnerability Study as a base for the susceptibility analysis. This study used the following factors to determine sensitivity of the water supplies: depth to top of aquifer, depth to water, geology of overlying material, and whether the system was confined or unconfined. All Black Hills public water supplies were considered sensitive. The EPA indicated the \"influence of the vadose zone\" is also a very important factor. The TAC suggested a \"hydrogeologic setting\" factor should be considered, such as fractured bedrock or unconsolidated aquifer material. The DENR will clarify any remaining issues and provide modifications to the draft document at the next TAC meeting. Schedule Next Meeting In order to discuss susceptibility issues, an additional meeting is tentatively scheduled on Thursday, October 22, 1998 in Pierre and Rapid City over the Rural Development Telecommunications Network.A-55Appendix C5 Source Water Assessment Program Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary October 22, 1998 Attendees Bill Markley DENR - Ground Water Quality Anita Yan DENR - Ground Water Quality Tom Brandner DENR - Ground Water Quality Trica Sebes DENR - Ground Water Quality Missy Mathis DENR - Minerals and Mining Bill Baer DENR - Surface Water Quality Rob Kittay DENR - Drinking Wat er Gene Stueven DENR - Watershed Protection Stan Pence DENR - Geological Survey Foster Sawyer DENR - Geological Survey Jay Gilbertson East Dakota Water Development District Terry Plucker SD Rural Water Association Martin Jarrett SD Water Congress and Big Sioux Community Rural Water Tim Stanfinach City of Sioux Falls Jack Epstein US Geological Survey Larry Putnamn US Geological Survey Introduction Anita Yan Everyone was introduced. EPA sent the ASTM Guide: Standard Guide to Selection of Methods for Assessing Ground Water or Aquifer Sensitivity and Vulnerability if anyone is interested. The deadline for the four contractors hired by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to gather Global Positioning System (GPS) information on all public water supply systems in the state was September 30, 1998. Currently, DENR personnel are reviewing the GPS data. DENR provided a potential contaminant source identification \"key\" to the contractors to help in the identification of the potential sources. Proposed Susceptibility Approach Anita Yan The objective of this meeting is to come to a consensus regarding the draft susceptibility analysis approach, and to discuss potential problems with the proposed approach and solve any potential problems. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires the susceptibility analysis be objective, not arbitrary and capricious, and be applied consistently statewide. A susceptibility analysis must be conducted for each potential contaminant source. The analysis will evaluate the intrinsic and induced risk of the contaminant, and the contaminant source will be given a score for each. The intrinsic risk score and induced risk score will be normalized to give equal weight to intrinsic versus induced risks. The normalized intrinsic and induced risk scores will be combined using a root-mean-square formula to obtain the potential contaminant source risk score. Based on the resulting potential contaminant source risk score, the potential contaminant source will be designated as being a high, moderate, or low risk to the source water of the public water supply system being assessed. The risk factor values are pre-assigned and depend on the situation or site condition. Where data is unavailable or unknown, a default value will be used, resulting in a conservative, higher risk score. The intrinsic and induced risk factors are assigned based on the site conditions or situation.Appendix C 5: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 22, 1998 A-56The results of the susceptibility analysis will be sent to the local public water supplier or community leader for review and comment. The results will include the site conditions or situation used to evaluate each potential contaminant source. If the recipient of the draft results provides corrections or additional information regarding the potential contaminant source risk factors that can be substantiated, the new information will be incorporated into the susceptibility analysis. After the source water assessments (with the susceptibility determination) have been provided to each community, any concerned citizen can request a reevaluation of the susceptibility determination if new or corrected substantiated information regarding risk factors is provided. The susceptibility determination can be reevaluated locally or by the State, but revised source water assessments must be provided to the DENR for approvalThe pre- assigned risk factor values minimize subjectiveness and potential inconsistencies of susceptibility evaluations if conducted by different people . The root-mean-square formula automatically gives more weight to the risk category (induced vs. intrinsic risks) with the higher score. South Dakota is not in a position to have information on the risk factors for all potential contaminant sources and public water supply systems. Sending draft results to a local representative will ensure that local knowledge will be incorporated into the susceptibility analysis. The \"conflict resolution process\" allows concerned citizens an opportunity to voice their concerns and provide additional data regarding the site conditions or situation that may influence the susceptibility determination. The susceptibility analysis risk factor table and spreadsheet, which will be provided to the communities, allows community leaders to make informed decisions regarding siting of new facilities. It also allows community leaders and potential contaminant source owners/operators to see how an existing facility received its risk ranking, and potentially look for ways to reduce the risk to the drinking water source. Susceptibility Analysis Examples Medium size feedlot in shallow, unconfined aquifer located > 1mile from the PWSS. Facility is implementing best management practices (BMP). The facility is assumed to have nitrate contamination. Susceptibility = MODERATE Land Application area located over unconfined aquifer >50 feet below ground surface ( bgs), outside of the 100-year flood plain. Volume of contaminants are unknown and BMP are implemented. Susceptibility =MODERATE Agricultural chemical company w/ pre-existing spill in shallow, unconfined aquifer (0-50 feet bgs) located > 1 mile from PWSS. The quantity stored at the facility is greater than 5 times the SARA Title III reporting limits . Susceptibility = MODERATE Gas station located >25 miles from surface water source. The quantity stored is greater than the SARA Title III reporting limits . Susceptibility = HIGH Storm water drainage discharges 1-10 miles from the surface water PWSS. Pre-existing concentration in the intake and volume of contaminants are unknown. Susceptibility = HIGH Dry Cleaner located 0-500 feet from ground water source in confined aquifer (200-400 feet bgs). The distance to the recharge area is unknown. The well is located in the 100-year flood plain. The condition of the well is unknown. The quantity stored is greater than the SARA Title III reporting limits . It is not known if the facility practices BMPs. Susceptibility = MODERATE The susceptibility analysis needs work in the following areas: non-point source contamination, contaminant sources greater than 25 miles from the PWSS, and an evaluation of the sensitivity of the contaminant source risk score to the risk factors.Appendix C 5: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 22, 1998 A-57The DENR will be holding a public meeting on the proposed Source Water Assessment and Protection plan on November 18, 1998, 3:00 to 5:30 pm and 8:00 to 10:00 pm, at 11 RDTN locations statewide. The agenda for this meeting will include a summary of the SWAP plan, a question and answer period, followed by a period where the audience can state their comments and concerns. Discussion The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) questioned how the risk factor values were derived. The values were derived using best professional judgement and various EPA Wellhead Protection Program guidance documents. EPA did not distribute a final susceptibility guidance to DENR. The communities will be given maps with a \"high\", \"moderate\", or \"low\" susceptibility rating for each potential contaminant source. What will DENR tell the communities regarding these ratings? The risk factors are conservatively high and they are a relative risk rating- not an absolute risk. The ratings are meant to be used by a community planner to help them prioritize areas they should be focussing on to protect their water supply. The TAC suggested adding a risk factor value for soil media and slope over the potential contaminant source. The TAC also questioned why hydraulic conductivity was not considered as a susceptibility risk factor. This factor could be incorporated with the soil media risk factor. The availability of hydraulic conductivity information varies across the state. Therefore, the TAC suggested having a general category of hydraulic conductivity that is not based on a specific number, rather, it will be based on the soil or aquifer media. However, after further discussion, it was decided the soil media, slope and hydraulic conductivity risk factors are not needed; the depth to water and depth to aquifer risk factors are sufficient. The TAC also suggested considering the density of animal feedlot operations within a source water assessment area. One feedlot upstream of a public water supply system (PWSS) may not be a problem; however three or four feedlots may cause a problem. Therefore, a \"cumulative effects\" factor for potential contaminant sources was suggested, or possibly evaluate the overall PWSS susceptibility . It was decided that the \"cumulative effects\" factor should be conducted at the local level, not in the state susceptibility rating. The TAC also suggested considering the pumping rate, dilution rate, and recharge rate of the PWSS in the susceptibility analysis. The TAC suggested adding a \"depth to aquifer\" factor and consider the thickness and nature of the overlying material. The TAC questioned the importance of the \"distance of PWSS well to the recharge area\" risk factor. This risk factor would be more important if it were included as an induced risk factor, and would read \"distance of the contaminant source to the recharge area\". This particular risk factor would be especially important in the Black Hills region, where ground water travel times are rapid in karst areas. The TAC is concerned about potential contaminant sources located on the recharge areas in the Black Hills. The current susceptibility analysis would most likely rate these contaminant sources in the moderate or low range, rather than high. The TAC suggested modifying the susceptibility analysis in the Black Hills region, as done for the delineation method. The TAC also suggested either adding or increasing the risk factor values for karst areas; thereby, allowing for high susceptibility ratings over Black Hills recharge areas even though all other factors, including distance, are low. The TAC suggested considering a \"ground cover\" risk factor such as forestland, rangeland, pavement, etc. for non- point source contamination identification. The condition of the ground cover must also be considered because it will affect the infiltration rate of the ground cover. This risk factor can be combined with a slope risk factor. All bedrock aquifers are fractured; therefore, the TAC suggested the \"fracture\" characteristic be segregated into the \"quality of the fractures\" and assigned risk factor values. However, this information is not available for all areas in the state. The SDGS or the PWSS may want to gather this information, maybe through additional studies conducted by universities. The \"degree of fractures\" is subjective, and therefore cannot be used in the susceptibility analysis.Appendix C 5: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 22, 1998 A-58The TAC created an example using the proposed risk factor values for a gas station located over the Madison aquifer \"loss\" zone in the Black Hills. The example was determined to have a normalized intrinsic score of 89 and therefore, a \"high\" susceptibility rating. The TAC agreed that this score is appropriate for recharge areas in the Black Hills region. The TAC is concerned with the intrinsic risk factor values for depth to water. A few of the ranges should be consolidated into one range. For example, the depth to water range should be simplified to \">200 feet\", instead of using various ranges such as, \"200-400 feet\" and \"400-800 feet\". The TAC discussed adding the aquifer material, such as a sand and gravel, as a risk factor. The susceptibility analysis accounts for the nature if the aquifer, for example if it is confined or unconfined. Therefore, the TAC concluded an additional risk factor is not needed. The TAC suggested increasing the risk factor value for an unconfined aquifer to an \"8\" or \"9\" and increasing the a karst aquifer to \"12\" or \"13\". Karst aquifers are more vulnerable than fractured aquifers. The TAC suggested adding a risk factor for each of the aquifers in the Black Hills rather than assigning risk factor based on the nature of individual characteristics of the aquifer. The TAC decided to refine the characteristics to fall within one category rather than assigning individual characteristics for each aquifer. The susceptibility analysis should be as simple as possible, allowing untrained, outside entities to use the analysis. The TAC inquired how non-point source pollution would be handled. The TAC recommended concentrating non- point source identification efforts in Zone A, and examining percentages of non-point source land use in Zone B source water assessment areas. The TAC inquired how the non-point source information would be collected. The GPS contract identifying the location of all PWSS in the state, also gathered land use information within a 500-foot radius around the wellhead. Also, the Natural Resources Conservation Service publishes Natural Resource Inventory data. This information has a Geographical Information System (GIS) layer that can identify the distance from a cornfield, for example, to a point source - wellhead. The NRI is updated every 5 years, however, the scale is 1: 250,000. The TAC suggested reducing the risk factor value from \"3\" to \"1\" for the risk factor \"PWSS well or intake conditions\" for a well in good condition, and to also add an intermediate category, such as \"fair\". The TAC suggested combining the risk factor \"PWSS well construction standards\" and \"PWSS well conditions\" into one category. However, it was decided to keep these risk factors separate because the \"PWSS well construction standards\" risk factor takes into account the overall system and the \"PWSS well conditions\" risk factor takes into account the individual well. Information for both of these risk factors may be available through the Drinking Water Program. The TAC suggested changing the risk factor score for \"Known open release case attributed to the potential contaminant source\" from \"5\" to \"1\" if the response is \"no\". The TAC suggested changing the risk factor value for \"Greater than SARA Title III minimum reporting limits, but less than 5 times that limit\" from \"4\" to \"6\". The TAC suggested that landfills should not be weighted as heavily as SARA Title III facilities because the latter stores a concentrated amount of chemicals, and landfill material is spread out over a wide area. It was noted that the critical issue with landfills, and other potential contaminant sources, are the management practices at these facilities. The TAC suggested considering tertiary treatment and mechanical treatment at wastewater treatment facilities in addition to evaluating volume stored at the facility. The TAC suggested the minimum risk factor value for any feedlot with more than 100 animal units, regardless of amount of time used per year, should be \"5\". Animal unit information may be available through the local Natural Resources Conservation Service, if they are willing to divulge that information.Appendix C 5: Technical Advisory Committee Meeting Summary, October 22, 1998 A-59The TAC inquired if there are accepted, consistent, standardized best management practices for every potential contaminant source and land use category in the susceptibility analysis. How will the DENR determine if the facility owner is following best management practices? Research on all potential contaminant sources would have to be done , this may not be practical. Due to the importance of this factor, the TAC noted that the \"best management practices (BMP) in place\" risk factor should have a higher risk factor value than the other factors, such as 40. DENR can only look at regulated facilities to examine BMPs, otherwise it may be considered trespassing. It was suggested that facilities with unknown best management practices should be given the default value; the facility may contest the susceptibility rating it they disagree. Inspecting for BMP may not be possible. DENR does not have the resources, time, and personnel to conduct these inspections for every potential contaminant source. The TAC suggested replacing the risk factor \"best management practices\" with \"containment system in place?\" Many of these contaminant systems are visible when conducting a windshield surveys or on-site inspections, e.g. underground storage tanks and above ground storage tanks. The TAC suggested including manure storage areas with the animal feedlots category, and increasing the risk factor to \"6\". The TAC suggested distinguishing between tiled cropland and non-tiled cropland. Tiled cropland is a quick way of moving nutrients from the soil to a stream. Tiled cropland should have a higher risk factor than non-tiled cropland, \"8\" and \"6\", respectively The TAC suggested, for Zone A assessment areas, addressing the intensity of land use. For example, row cropland should have a higher susceptibility rating than perennial grassland. Land with greater than 50% row crop should have a risk factor value of \"7\", and land less than 50% row crop should have a risk factor value of \"3\". The TAC suggested increasing the risk factor value for a paint shop from a \"6\" to \"8\" and a printing facility should be increased to \"6\". The TAC suggested deleting the risk factor \"construction excavation areas\" from the potential contaminant source inventory since it is a transient risk factor. This potential contaminant source will be deleted from the list. The TAC raised concerns that the risk factors in the Residential Category are insignificant if every house were evaluated. The values should be simplified based on if the residential area uses septic systems, or if the area has a community wastewater system. The TAC suggested rating all waste management facilities as having a risk factor value of \"10\" with the exception of recycling and waste reduction facilities. The susceptibility analysis discussion will be continued after lunch at the DENR offices, everyone is welcome to attend. Thank you for attending this meeting.A-61Appendix D Citizen Advisory Committee Members WATER MANAGEMENT BOARD MEMBERS BOARD OF WATER AND NATURAL RESOURCES MEMBERS Francis Brink, consulting engineer Don Bollweg, crop sprayer Rodney Freeman, attorney Dale Kennedy, farmer Marian Gunderson, member at large John Loucks, engineer Leo Holzbauer, irrigation representative and trucker Steve Lowrie, newspaper publisher Bernita Loucks, realtor Roger Larsen, insurance representative Joel Rickenbach, rancher Gregg Greenfield, attorney Dwayne Rollag, SDSU Dean of Civil Engineering Jerry Kleinsasser, farmer MEETING DATES MEETING DATES December 3, 1997 November 12, 1997 February 25, 1998 March 26, 1998 December 2, 1998 December 9, 1998A-63Appendix D1 Source Water Assessment Program Citizen Advisory Committee Meetings Summary November 12, 1997 & December 3, 1997 November 12, 1998 Water Management Board Attendees: Francis Brink Dwayne Rollag Rodney Freeman Joel Rickenbach Leo Holzbauer Bernita Loucks Marian Gunderson December 3, 1998 Board of Water and Natural Resources Attendees: Steve Lowrie John Loucks Dale Kennedy Don Bollweg Greg Greenfield Roger Larsen Introduction to the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Jeanne Goodman/Bill Markley The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is a requirement of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. These amendments require states to develop the source water assessment program, complete source water assessments for all public water supplies, and allow states to set aside up to 10% of FY97 Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to complete the assessments. A complete Source Water Assessment and Protection Program document, that will be developed by DENR, will describe how South Dakota will involve the public in the development of the source water program. The document will also describe South Dakota's source water assessment approach, how the assessment information will be made available to the public, and how the source water program will be implemented. South Dakota will organize a Technical Advisory Committee to develop the source water program. The committee will include DENR expertise, and outside agency expertise, including SD Department of Agriculture and Water Development Districts. In order to receive citizen input, South Dakota will utilize existing DENR citizens boards, Board of Water and Natural Resources and Water Management Board, as a Citizen Advisory Committee. South Dakota will also hold a series of public meetings throughout the state to gather citizen input on the program. The first step to completing a source water assessment is delineating the area contributing water to a public water supply system. For ground water systems, this includes delineating the area of influence around a wellfield. For surface water systems, a delineation will include the entire watershed upstream of the public water supply intake or diversion point. The second step in a source water assessment is to identify significant potential contaminant sources within the delineated area. DENR must determine what is considered a \"significant\" potential contaminant source. The third step in a source water assessment is to determine the \"susceptibility\" of the water source to potential contaminant sources. This includes determining the likelihood that the pollution source will impact the water source. The extent of the susceptibility analysis is not yet defined. Once the assessments have been completed, the r esults of the assessments must be made available to the public. DENR will most likely distribute the source water assessments to the public in a paper format and an electronic format, through the DENR Internet web site. The results of the assessments must include a map with the delineated area and significant contamination sources identified. The results of the susceptibility analysis must also be displayed on the map.Appendix D 1: Citizens Advisory Committee Meeting Summaries, November 12, 1997 & December 3, 1997 A-64The DENR has set-aside 10% of FY 97 Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to complete the assessments. DENR will submit a work plan for set-aside as part of the 1997 Intended Use Plan to the EPA when completed. DENR will also hold public meetings throughout the state to gather input on the program. Following the development of the Source Water Assessment Program document, DENR will submit the document to EPA for approval. Once the document is approved, DENR will complete source water assessments for all public water systems in the state. DENR must submit the proposed source water program document to EPA by February 1999. EPA has nine months to review the document, and once approved, a ll assessments must be completed within 2 years. The entire process - from assessments through management - requires input and support from the public, local governments, and public water supply system owners and operators.A-65Appendix D2 Source Water Assessment Program Citizen Advisory Committee Meetings Summary February 25, 1998 & March 26, 1998 February 25, 1998 Water Management Board Attendees: Francis Brink Dwayne Rollag Rodney Freeman Joel Rickenbach Leo Holzbauer March 26, 1998 Board of Water and Natural Resources Attendees: Steve Lowrie Dale Kennedt Don Bollweg Jerry Kleinsasser Roger Larsen Greg Greenfield Work Plan for the State Revolving Fund Intend Use Plan Tricia Sebes Source water protection uses pollution prevention measure to focus on protecting the area surrounding public drinking water supplies from potential contamination. The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is a requirement of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act which requires states to develop a program. These amendments also require states to complete source water assessments for all public water supply systems and allows states to set- aside up to 10% of FY 1997 Drinking Water State Revolving Funds to complete the source water assessments. South Dakota must develop a Source Water Assessment and Protection Program document that will describe how South Dakota will accomplish the following: involve the public in the development of the program, conduct the source water assessments, make the results of the assessments available to the public, and how South Dakota will implement the program. South Dakota is required to establish a Citizens Advisory (CAC) and a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to assist in the development of the source water program. South Dakota is using the established citizen's boards, Water Management Board and the Board of Water and Natural Resources, as the CAC. The TAC will consist of representatives from DENR programs and outside agency expertise. DENR must submit the proposed source water program document to EPA by February 1999. EPA has nine months to review the document, and once approved, a ll assessments must be completed within 2 years. The entire process - from assessments through management - requires input and support from the public, local governments, and public water supply system owners and operators. The Intended Use Workplan describes the following: the funding amount available to conduct source water assessments; number of full time employees needed to conduct the assessments; the goals and objectives, outputs and deliverables of the source water program; the schedule for completing the assessments; the responsibilities of various agencies involved in the source water program; and a description of the evaluation process used to assess the success of the work funded under the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. DENR set aside 10% of the FY 1997 State Drinking Water Revolving Fund to complete the source water assessments. This amount totals $1,255,880. However, the estimated cost of completing the source water program is approximately $2,230,000. Additional funding sources may include Public Water Supply System, Nonpoint Source 319, and 106 Ground Water.Appendix D 2: Citizens Advisory Committee Meeting Summaries, February 25, 1998 & March 26, 1998 A-66The goal of South Dakota's Intended Use Workplan is to complete the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program within time frame allowed by the Safe Drinking Water Act. Outputs of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program include: the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program document; contracts with entities outside the DENR to conduct source water assessments; public meeting summaries; completed assessments, including maps with delineated areas, potential pollution sources, and results of susceptibility analyses; and making the results of the source water assessments available to the public through informational brochures. South Dakota plans to organize a Technical Advisory Committee by April 1998 and plans to submit the Intended Use Plan Workplan to EPA by mid-April. South Dakota plans to submit the completed program document to the EPA in February 1999. Following EPA approval, South Dakota plans to complete all source water assessment and provide assessment results to the public by May 2003. The Ground Water Quality Program is responsible for: implementing the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program; organizing and directing the efforts of the technical advisory committee meetings; drafting the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Plan; working with the DENR's citizen boards; conducting source water assessments for all public water supply systems; negotiating and administering contracts to complete source water assessments; and coordinating wellhead protection efforts with the source water assessment program. The following DENR Programs will participate on the Technical Advisory Committee to assist in the development of the Source Water Assessment and Protection plan: Minerals and Mining Exploration Program, Drinking Water Program, Water and Waste Water Funding, Information Services, Watershed Program, South Dakota Geological Survey, Water Rights Program, Surface Water Program, and the Waste Management Program. Additional organizations that may participate in the development of the source water program include: Environmental Protection Agency, US Geological Survey, SD Association of Rural Water Systems, Water Development Districts, South Dakota Water Congress, American Water Works Association, SD Department of Agriculture, Universities, and Municipal League. DENR will evaluate the success of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program by the number of local source water protection programs that are developed; the number of significant pollution sources threatening a public water supply that are cleaned up, removed, or remediated to the extent that the threat is removed; and by the downward trend in the number of significant violations of standards by public water supply systems. A-67Appendix D3 Source Water Assessment Program Citizen Advisory Committee Meetings Summary December 2, 1998 & December 9, 1998 December 2, 1998 Water Management Board Attendees: Francis Brink Dwayne Rollag Rodney Freeman Joel Rickenbach Leo Holzbauer Bernita Loucks Marian Gunderson December 9, 1998 Board of Water and Natural Resources Attendees: Steve Lowrie John Loucks Greg Greenfield Roger Larsen Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Update Anita Yan The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is an outgrowth of the Wellhead Protection Program. South Dakota's Wellhead Protection Program was approved by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1992. The Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP) is a requirement of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. Elements of a complete SWAP include involving the public in the development of the program, conducting a source water assessment at all public water supply systems (PWSS) in South Dakota, distributing source water assessment information to the public, and implementing the source water protection program locally. The technical advisory committee consists of 22 representatives from the following DENR programs: Ground Water Quality, Surface Water Quality, Drinking Water, Geological Survey, Watershed Protection, Water & Waste Funding, Water Rights, Waste Management. Non-DENR Representatives include the Association of Rural Water Systems, South Dakota Water Congress, Water Development Districts, American Water Works Association, SD Dept. of Agriculture, Ag Unity, Municipal League, City Sioux Falls, Indian Health Services, SD School of Mines & Technology, US Environmental Protection Agency, US Geological Survey, and US Bureau of Reclamation. This committee convened 4 times. A Black Hills Delineation meeting was held to discuss source water issues in the Black Hills region. In addition to representatives on the Technical Advisory committee, the following stakeholders also attended: Black Hills Power and Light, the City of Rapid City, City of Spearfish , City of Hot Springs, Dakota Cement, Lawrence County Commissioners, Lead-Deadwood Sanitary District, Mining and Exploration Services, and US Forest Service/Black Hills National Forest. DENR is utilizing the DENR Board of Water and Natural Resources and Water Management Board as the Citizens Advisory Committee. The DENR has presented source water information at approximately 10 workshops and seminars throughout South Dakota. Source water information was sent to all public water supply systems owner/operators and mayors. In order to receive public involvement and comments on the source water program, two meetings were held on November 18, 1998. These meetings were advertised in 11 daily newspapers within South Dakota and in Indian Country Today . Governor Janklow issued a press release on the public meeting and invitations were sent to all 760Appendix D 3: Citizens Advisory Committee Meeting Summaries, December 2, 1998 & December 9, 1998 A-68public water supply system (PWSS) owners/operators, and to approximately 1,000 potentially interested stakeholders. A source water assessment is a method to evaluate the likelihood or potential for contaminants to get into a public drinking water supply. A complete source water assessment includes 3 steps: delineating the area contributing water to the system, inventorying the significant sources of pollution in the delineated area, and assessing the susceptibility of the water system to each pollution source. The ground water delineation method for non-sensitive , non-Black Hills PWSS is a 500-foot arbitrary fixed-radius around the well. There are approximately 150 non-sensitive systems in South Dakota. The delineation method for vulnerable transient, non-community (TNC) PWSS is the calculated fixed-radius method. There are approximately 78 TNC PWSS in the state and these include campgrounds, restaurants, and motels. The delineation methods for the approximately 98 vulnerable, non-Black Hills PWSS are hydrogeologic mapping, analytical method, and/or calculated fixed-radius delineation method. The delineation method for surface water PWSS located outside the Black Hills Region will include the entire watershed upstream of the public water supply intake. The delineation method will include three zones of assessment, Zone A, Zone B, and Zone C. Zone A extends 10 river miles upstream of the PWSS intake, including tributaries, and 0.25-mile laterally beyond the mapped aquifer or river. Zone B includes the remaining delineated watershed. However, for PWSS located along the Missouri River, the assessment area includes the watershed within a 25-mile diameter circle from the intake. For PWSS along the Missouri River, Zone C includes the remaining delineated watershed. Due to the complex ground water and surface water interaction between SWAP areas in the Black Hills region, a holistic assessment approach is needed in this area. The delineation method will include two zones of assessment, Zone A and Zone B. Zone A will includes all aquifer recharge areas, a 0.25-mile or 0.5 mile radius around a wellhead, and 0.25 miles laterally beyond all stream or aquifers along the entire length of all perennial streams or tributaries. Zone B includes the remaining delineated watershed. A comprehensive contaminant source inventory will be conducted in Zone A and includes using all existing data from DENR, EPA, and outside agency databases; contacting PWSS operator and/or community leaders to request assistance in the inventory; and conducting field surveys in the delineated area. A limited contaminant source inventory will be conducted in Zone B. This includes using existing data from DENR, EPA, and outside agency databases. A contaminant source inventory will not be conducted in Zone C. DENR databases that will be used in the potential contaminant source inventory include: underground and aboveground storage tanks, community right-to-know information, animal feedlots and land application areas, abandoned mines, solid and hazardous waste facilities, and wastewater treatment facilities. Other non-DENR databases that will be used in the potential contaminant source inventory include: Fertilizer and Pesticide Inventory and Commercial Applicator Pesticide Use databases from the SD Dept of Agriculture, the Class V Underground Injection Control database from the US Environmental Protection Agency, the BASINS database from the US Geological Survey, and Natural Resources Inventory database from the Natural Resources Conservation Service. A susceptibility analysis will be conducted on all potential contaminant sources identified in the inventory. Susceptibility is the potential for a public water supply system to draw contaminated water into the system at concentrations that would pose concern. Each potential contaminant source will be evaluated and rated as a high, moderate, or low risk. The susceptibility ratings are relative, not absolute. The ratings will be specific to the PWSS and the rating method is designed to minimize inconsistencies. The susceptibility ratings are based on \"intrinsic\" and \"induced\" risk factors. If risk factor information is unknown or does not apply, those affected risk factors are not included in the evaluation. Intrinsic risk factors, those factors that cannot be controlled, include depth to water table or aquifer top, aquifer type, distance of the PWSS well or intake to recharge areas or water bodies, flood plain conditions around the well or intake, and existing concentrations of similar contaminants at the PWSS. Induced risk factors, those factors that can be controlled, include distance of the potential contaminant source to the public water supply well or intake, volume of contaminants at the potential contaminant source, and type of facility or land use attributed to the potential contaminant source.Appendix D 3: Citizens Advisory Committee Meeting Summaries, December 2, 1998 & December 9, 1998 A-69Source water assessment information must be distributed to the public. The final source water assessment report will include a summary of assessment information, a map of the assessment area, the relative location of potential contaminant sources, and the susceptibility rating (high, moderate, low) for each contaminant source. Source water assessment information will be sent to the PWSS owner/operators, mayors, or other community leaders. The source water assessment information will also be available on the South Dakota's Internet web page. DENR encourages PWSS to distribute assessment information to the public. The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan must be submitted to EPA by February 1999. Source water assessments are mandatory and must be completed by May 2003 by the state. Source water protection is voluntary and to be implemented by the local community. The EPA goal is to have 60% of community water system population covered by a full source water protection program by 2005. The entire process-from assessments through management-requires input and support from the public, local governments and PWSS owners/operators. DENR will work with communities to establish source water protection programs. South Dakota will evaluate the success of the program by the number of local protection programs developed. South Dakota has already been promoting the assembly of planning teams of responsible individuals from the community to manage the potential sources of contamination within wellhead protection areas, and will continue to do so for source water protection areas. South Dakota has already been promoting regulatory, non-regulatory, and multiple-jurisdiction management strategies through the wellhead protection program and will continue to do so for source water protection areas. South Dakota has set aside 10% of the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund money, $1.25 million dollars, to complete the source water assessments. The EPA approved South Dakota's Source Water Intended Use Workplan. The anticipated total cost of the SWAP Program is approximately $2.2 million dollars. DENR has 3.5 full time employees available to complete the source water assessments. South Dakota will use money from other grants and potentially approach other agencies to make up for the $900,000 shortfall in funding. Global Positioning System information at all non-sensitive PWSS and land use data around all PWSS were collected in the summer of 1998. Currently, DENR is receiving comments from the general public on the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan. The DENR will address all comments and finalize the proposed Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan for submittal to EPA in February 1999. Water Management Board Questions and Comments The Water Management Board (WMB) asked if DENR has been in contact with EPA throughout the development of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program, and whether the approach presented to the Board is concurrent with EPA guidelines. An EPA representative was on the source water Technical Advisory Committee and assisted in the development of the program plan. However, the EPA representative did not collaborate with DENR on the delineation method proposed for public water supply systems that do not use their emergency well for drinking water purposes. DENR proposes not to conduct an assessment for these systems. The WMB asked who would be conducting the source water assessments. The state is responsible for conducting all source water assessments; however, DENR may hire contractors to conduct portions of the assessments, such as gathering potential contaminant source information. Communities may also conduct their own source water assessments if they include all requirements in the EPA-approved Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan, but these assessments will be reviewed by DENR. The WMB inquired about the availability of DENR personnel to complete all source water assessments in the state. At least three full time employees (FTE) from Ground Water Quality and Minerals and Mining, and one FTE from the South Dakota Geological Survey will be working on the Source Water Assessment Program. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, DENR may contract with outside entities to conduct source water assessments. DENR has started to gather information to conduct the source water assessments by collecting Global Positioning Systems information on all public water supply systems in the state. DENR may conduct ground water source water assessments prior to EPA approval of the source water plan.Appendix D 3: Citizens Advisory Committee Meeting Summaries, December 2, 1998 & December 9, 1998 A-70The WMB commented that the Source Water Assessment Program is another federal government program that requires the state to conduct an assessment for all public water supply systems . Currently funds are available to complete this program. Eventually, the US Congress will require all municipalities to implement Source Water Protection Programs; however, funding will not be available for to complete these requirements. The WMB asked whether individual septic systems would be identified as potential contaminant sources in the source water assessment process. The WMB indicated that, at a minimum, those areas of known concentrated septic systems should be considered as a potential contaminant source. DENR will not consider individual septic systems as a potential contaminant source. However, DENR will treat septic systems as a non-point source of pollution. For example, if a residential development does not have a central wastewater treatment facility, the entire development would be evaluated as one unit, and assigned a susceptibility rating accordingly. The WMB granted unconditional approval of the approach presented in the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan. Board of Water and Natural Resources Questions and Comments A commentator from the public questioned the susceptibility analysis rating scheme. The commentator mentioned it seems facilities will receive a \"high\" rating due to their location in relation to a public water supply system, and DENR is not taking into consideration that best management practices may be used at the facility. The commentator is concerned that facilities have to \"prove their innocence\" that they are not polluting to DENR. DENR indicated the susceptibility analysis considers other factors in addition to the location of a facility. These factors include the type of facility, volume of contaminants stored at the facility, and whether the facility utilizes pollution prevention measures. Therefore, one factor, such as location of the facility, may receive a higher rating; however, five other susceptibility factors may receive a lower rating. This may balance the final susceptibility rating to \"low\" rating rather than \"high\". In addition, the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan includes a \"dispute resolution process\" for an owner of a facility or other concerned citizen who wishes to dispute the susceptibility rating in their source water assessment. The Board of Water and Natural Resources (BWNR) asked how DENR will address non-point source pollution in the potential contaminant source inventory. DENR will identify non-point sources based on land use in a particular area. Land use categories include agricultural, commercial, residential, municipal, or industrial. The BWNR concurred with the methods and approaches described in the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan, subject to further refinement from the Technical Advisory Committee after they receive public comments.A-71Appendix D4 Invitation for the Water Management Board Meetings NAME ORGANIZATION CITY STATE ITEMS RECEIVED ACTION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT RAPID CITY SD A, M WILLIAM COX, DIR AS/CEV/CR DALLAS TX A CINDY LUNDIN BLACK HAWK WATER USER DISTRICT BLACK HAWK SD A JANET RYAN BLACK HILLS ALLIANCE RAPID CITY SD A EVERETT E.

The new activities will be part of the State's Source Water Assessment Program, which is a required by the 1996 Amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. As part of this, the department is undertaking a statewide effort to identify possible activities in South Dakota that can affect the quality of drinking water sources for the 760 public drinking water systems in the state. The meetings will include an overview of the Department's proposed Source Water Assessment Program plan and a question and answer session, which will be followed by a comment period when citizens may voice their comments, suggestions, and recommendations regarding the proposed plan. Input from the public will be addressed into the Department's final Source Water Assessment Program plan that will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval before the February 1999 deadline. The Department will host two public input meetings over the Rural Development Telecommunications (RDT) Network on Wednesday, November 18, 1998 from 3:00-5:30 pm and 8:00-10:00 pm Central Standard Time. The public is invited to attend any of the eleven RDT Network stations as listed: For more information on the Source Water Assessment Program, contact Tricia Sebes at 605-773-3296, email : , or view the draft Source Water Assessment plan on the department's Website at www.state.sd.us/ denr under Hot Topics .

The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is required to draft a Source Water Assessment and Protection Program through requirements of the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments. The purpose of this meeting is to provide the public an overview of the proposed program and give the public a chance to ask questions and provide comments to DENR. Written questions and comments can be submitted to the DENR by December 18, 1998. In December 1998, the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan will be presented to DENR's Water Management Board and Board of Water and Natural Resources for approval. Following approval from the DENR citizen boards, the final draft plan will be submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in February 1999 for approval. Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Overview Anita Yan Why is DENR conducting source water assessments? The availability of safe drinking water is vital to the economy and growth of South Dakota. The SD DENR is the primary agency responsible for protecting aquifers of the state for future beneficial use as drinking water. To facilitate protection of the public drinking water supplies in South Dakota, DENR is developing methods to identify possible sources of contamination to the 760 public drinking water systems in the state. These methods will be incorporated into the state's Source Water Assessment Program, a requirement of the 1996 Amendments to the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act. Why should the public be interested in the source water assessment program? Drinking water issues affect everybody because everyone wants to have confidence that they're getting safe drinking water when they turn on their tap to take a drink. While the majority of public drinking water systems in our state can provide that confidence, these assessments will help ensure that confidence remains for many years to come. Those involved in agricultural, commercial, and industrial enterprises may have additional interest in DENR's approaches to the assessments because certain facilities and activities may be included in the inventory of potential pollution sources. What is a source water assessment? A source water assessment includes three steps: 1. defining the most critical area contributing water to a public water source 2. inventorying potential pollution sources in that critical area, and 3. rating the potential pollution sources to determine their relative threat to the water supply Every state is required to provide assessment information to the public no later than May 2003. Local communities, including water system operators, community leaders, and planners will be responsible for taking the information inAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-113these assessments, designating a source water protection area, and determining methods to protect their public drinking water supply. How will the source water assessment areas be delineated? For ground water wells, the critical areas contributing water will be delineated using several methods already in use in South Dakota under the Wellhead Protection Program. These methods may be as simple as drawing a circle around the well, or it may be quite complicated and involve mathematical modeling. EPA approved South Dakota's Wellhead Protection Program in September 1992. The Source Water Assessment Program is an extension of the Wellhead Protection Program in that now surface water sources are included. For public water supply systems supplied by surface water, South Dakota is required to delineate the entire watershed. However, the department will concentrate its efforts in the areas nearest to and upstream of the surface water intake. The department is proposing to treat the Black Hills as a single unit due to the complex nature of the aquifer recharge areas which affect streams and underground water flows . The department proposes to use a combination of the ground water and surface water delineation methods and will include aquifer recharge areas in the Black Hills. Once the critical area contributing water to a public drinking water supply has been identified, an inventory of possible pollution sources will be conducted. Why and how will the potential contaminant source inventory be conducted? In order to protect, manage, and plan, a community needs to know where the possible problems exist. A potential contaminant source inventory will consist of using the existing information within DENR and other state and federal agency databases. These databases include facilities regulated by the federal and state government and facilities where releases of contaminants to the environment have been reported. Land uses and facilities that may be identified during the potential contaminant source inventory include, but are not limited to: mining operations, medical institutions, golf courses, animal feedlots, pasture and rangeland, cropland, manure and chemical application areas, manure and chemical storage areas, and petroleum storage facilities, such as gasoline stations. Table 3.1 in the draft Source Water Assessment Plan is a detailed list of potential contaminant sources. To help manage the potential contaminant source identification, local governments and community leaders will be encouraged to assist with their inventory. As time and other resources allow, a more detailed inventory, including field verification, may be conducted. Why and how will the susceptibility analysis be conducted? If a facility is identified as a potential source of pollution to drinking water, the susceptibility of the drinking water source to contamination by the potential pollution source will be evaluated. An analysis will be conducted to rate the susceptibility of a public water supply system to each potential contaminant source identified in the source water assessment area. Susceptibility is defined as the potential for a public water supply system to draw contaminated water into a ground water well or surface water intake. Relative to each public water supply system, each potential contaminant source will be evaluated for several risk factors. Based on the evaluation, the individual risk factors will be assigned values. The risk factor values will be combined mathematically to result in a susceptibility score. The possible scores, and therefore potential risks, under this system will be divided into high, moderate and low ranges. The susceptibility analyses will provide an overall relative rating of the susceptibility of a drinking water source to contamination by a potential pollution source. The ratings are meant to provide the water system operators, community leaders and planners a system to prioritize their management measures and are not meant to be absolute risk ratings. In other words, a high rating does not necessarily mean that the public water supply system is highly susceptible to contamination from a potential pollution source. Instead, a high rating means that compared to a potential pollution source with a moderate rating, this facility poses more of a threat to the drinking water source.Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-114The draft Source Water Assessment Program plan includes several examples of how the risk posed by potential sources of contamination, including agricultural sources, to a public drinking water supply source would be evaluated. How will the citizens of South Dakota benefit from the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program? The availability of safe drinking water is vital to the economy of this state and important to every person living in this state. Most people are good stewards of the land and natural resources. Most people are responsible citizens who wish to do what they can to maintain their quality of life and to protect the natural resources that contribute to their quality of life. However, sometimes it is not clear what can or should be done to protect those resources. The source water assessments will provide some of this information. The source water assessments will provide information regarding the relative risk posed by a facility or a land use to possible contamination of a public drinking water supply. Once this risk is known, individual citizens can work to reduce this risk. The Source Water Assessment Program is not a regulatory program. The methods outlined in the Source Water Assessment Program may also be used as part of the planning and siting of future facilities to reduce potential risk to public drinking water sources. However, the pertinent information gathered through the Source Water Assessment Program will be provided to the water system operators, community leaders, and planners for their use. The water system operators, community leaders and planners may implement management measures to protect the local public drinking water supply. These management measures may include, but are not limited to education, voluntary implementation of best management plans, voluntary water quality monitoring, encouragement of water conservation, and zoning. Who is responsible for conducting the source water assessments? In South Dakota, DENR has the responsibility of developing this program and conducting these assessments. If the local public water system operator wants to do their own assessment, the department will provide the guidance and assistance so that all assessments are done consistently across the state. The department may issue contracts for portions of the assessments to qualified firms or agencies. When will the source water assessments be conducted? South Dakota must submit the Source Water Assessment Program plan to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for approval by February 1999. The EPA has until November 1999 to approve the plan. However, the wellhead protection portions of the program have already been approved and the DENR may begin those portions of the assessments in December 1998. Assessments for all 760 public drinking water systems in South Dakota must be completed within 3 1/2 years of EPA's approval of the final Source Water Assessment Program plan. Therefore, it is expected that the Source Water Assessments will be completed for all public water supply systems within South Dakota by May 2003. For more Information More information on the Source Water Assessment Program, including the draft plan in its entirety and a summary of the program, can be found on the Department of Environment and Natural Resources' website at: www.state.sd.us/ denr under Hot Topics, or contact Tricia Sebes at the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Ground Water Quality Program, at 605-773-3296, or email at tricia.sebes@ .state.sd.us . Questions NOTE: For completeness, answers to questions may include information not presented during the public meetings. 1. Are the source water assessments tied to Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) assessments that are currently being conducted by DENR? A TMDL is a quantitative assessment of water quality problems and contributing pollutant sources. A TMDL provides the information needed to specify the amount of a pollutant that needs to be reduced by individual sources so that lakes, rivers, streams, or estuaries meet state water quality standards and designated water uses. The Source Water Assessment Program and the TMDL Program are separate programs within DENR; however, there is a lot of overlap between the programs. Information collected through the TMDL assessments will add to theAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-115information collected through the Source Water Assessment Program, and vice versa. However, it will not be possible to develop TMDLs for every listed water body within the time frame of the Source Water Assessment Program. The time frame to develop TMDLs for all the listed water body is 13 years, in accordance with EPA guidelines. For water serving as a source for a public water supply, the data developed as part of the TMDL assessment can provide a basis for implementing local source water protection programs. 2. Should the risk factor \"PWSS well or intake condition\" in Appendix T, Susceptibility Analysis Risk Factors on page 130, be included as an intrinsic risk factor rather than an induced risk factor? Induced risk factors are specific to the potential contaminant source; a well or intake is not a source of contamination. Intrinsic risk factors are the risk factors that exist by virtue of the hydrogeologic and physical setting of the water source, including depth to water, aquifer characteristics, and flood plain conditions. Induced risk factors are risk factors that exist due to human activities at the water source and at the various potential contaminant sources. Induced risk factors include distance of potential contaminant to the water source, volume of contaminant stored at the facility, and well or intake condition. Therefore, DENR will consider \"PWSS well or intake condition\" to be an induced risk factor. 3. Although the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is currently not mandatory, will the program be mandatory in the future? South Dakota is required by the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments to develop a Source Water Assessment Program. However, South Dakota is not required to develop a Source Water Protection Program. Communities can use the information collected through source water assessments to develop source water protection programs to manage their water supplies. DENR is not requiring the implementation of source water protection programs; however, DENR will assist any community interested in developing a source water protection program. DENR is not aware of any directives from EPA to require protection programs. However, it is always possible EPA may require mandatory protection measures in the future. 4. Why are septic systems only included in the \"residential\" category in Table 3.1: Potential Contaminant Sources Listed by Category on page 34 of the draft document? Commercial facilities may also use septic systems. DENR will include septic systems in both the \"residential\" and \"commercial\" categories in Table 3.1 in the final document. 5. Does the location of a potential contaminant source dictate the susceptibility rating? For example, will a storage tank in good condition located in close proximity to a water source receive a higher susceptibility rating than a storage tank in poor condition located farther from the water source? Will the state regulate the facility with the higher rating prior to regulating the facility with the lower rating? A potential contaminant source located close to a water source does not necessarily result in a high susceptibility rating. There are many factors considered in the susceptibility analysis including distance to the water source, volume of contaminants stored at the facility, and utilization of pollution prevention measures at the facility. The Source Water Assessment Program is not a regulatory program; rather, it is a tool that communities can use to manage their water supplies. The Source Water Assessment Program will not affect other regulatory programs. However , if there is violation at a potential contaminant source, DENR will take the necessary action to correct any potential problems. 6. How many source water assessments have been completed and what information has been gathered to complete the assessments? The location of all public water supply systems in South Dakota has been collected using Global Positioning System (GPS) equipment. A complete source water assessment program includes three steps: 1) delineate the area contributing water to the water source, 2) inventorying all potential contaminant sources in the delineated area, and 3) determining the susceptibility of the potential contaminant sources to the water source. Source water assessmentsAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-116have been started at approximately 150 public water systems. No source water assessments have been completed in the state; however, communities in eastern South Dakota have developed wellhead protection programs. These communities have delineated the area contributing water to their system and have implemented management strategies to protect their water supplies, including county zoning ordinances. DENR is able to start portions of the source water assessment program prior to receiving EPA approval. These portions include delineating ground water areas and conducting potential contaminant source inventories around those delineated areas. However, the DENR must receive EPA approval before conducting surface water assessments or any susceptibility analyses. 7. Was the public water supply system locational survey conducted in summer 1998 completed under the Wellhead Protection Program? South Dakota has identified the location of a public water supply systems along with reservoirs and other water distribution structures for a variety of reasons; however, the effort was spearheaded by the Source Water Assessment Program. 8. Are any other states using the susceptibility method proposed by South Dakota? Do we know what susceptibility method other states are using, and do we feel that the proposed method is the best for South Dakota? South Dakota does not know specifically what other states are proposing for their susceptibility analysis; however, when viewing other state documents on the Internet, South Dakota's method seems to be more detailed in terms of distinguishing risk factors. The EPA has provided very general guidance to states for developing a susceptibility method. The method must be consistent across South Dakota and cannot be arbitrary and capricious, meaning the results of the analysis must be consistent no matter who is conducting the susceptibility analysis. DENR feels the proposed method is appropriate for South Dakota. To date, Kentucky is the only state that has an approved Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. 9. Because water and watersheds do not recognize boundaries, what is in the draft source water assessment plan regarding developing a cooperative working relationship between federal, state, and tribal entities? On the Federal level, the EPA has been working with Forest Service and other federal agencies to develop interagency agreements. South Dakota has been working with all states in EPA Region VIII by participating in monthly conference calls to plan coordinate source water assessments efforts. Although the required assessment area will not extend beyond the state or tribal border, South Dakota has sent the draft document to the tribes and surrounding states to gather input and ask for assistance in identifying any potential contaminant source that may affect the water quality in South Dakota. The DENR has been attempting to schedule an informational meeting with the Tribes in December to discuss Source Water Assessment and Protection Program issues. 10. What resource does DENR have available to complete the source water assessments? South Dakota has set aside 10% or $1,255,880 of FY1997 Drinking Water Revolving Fund allotment for source water assessment and protection. The estimates of costs of completing the program exceed funds available by approximately $974,000. Other funding sources will be used to supplement this effort. These potential funds include Public Water System Supervision, Nonpoint Source 319, 106 Ground Water and potentially other environmental funding sources. A minimum of 3.5 DENR full time employees will be utilized for the development and implementation of South Dakota's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. 11. Who is responsible for media control and press releases to ensure the source water assessment information will not cause hysteria in the community? The source water assessment information collected and provided to the community leaders and planners is intended to be used to develop community source water protection programs . DENR considered the possibility that theAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-117assessment information could be misused, causing undue concern within a community. To minimize that possibility, DENR will not provide potential contaminant source ownership information. DENR is not planning on writing press releases; any press release would be controlled locally. 12. When a source water assessment area is delineated, will DENR verify the delineated boundaries, either through monitoring wells or aquifer tests? DENR is not planning to verify source water assessment areas; DENR is limited by time and money constraints. However, DENR encourages local communities to \"fine-tune\" their source water assessments by verifying their delineated areas. A community's final assessment report can be revised if additional information becomes available. 13. Does DENR have guidelines available to help communities develop source water protection programs? What assistance will DENR provide to communities interested in implementing protection programs? The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is building upon the DENR's existing Wellhead Protection Program. The DENR has developed a document entitled SD Wellhead Protection Guidelines which contains information on how communities can manage their source water protection areas by, for example, educating the community, conducting community clean-up days, and developing zoning ordinances. This document is available on the DENR-Ground Water Quality Internet website or by contacting DENR at (605) 773-3296. DENR is also considering the development and implementation of a state source water quality protection petition program. This state-administered program is voluntary for states and is intended to support locally driven efforts designed to address a limited number of contaminants identified in the local source water assessments. However, a state may submit a Petition Program for approval by EPA at any time, unlike the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Plan, which must be submitted to the EPA by February 1999. More information regarding the petition program will be added to the final Source Water Assessment and Protection Plan. 14. Has DENR set-aside money for land acquisition from the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund? No, however funds for land acquisition and conservation easements are available as loans under the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. DENR may set-aside funds for land acquisition loans in the future. 15. How is Section 3.5.5: Contaminants of Concern on page 36 of the draft document linked to the contaminant source inventory? A listing of contaminants of concern is required in the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Plan to indicate that sources of all regulated contaminants are considered, and to serve as a basis for the list of potential contaminant sources. DENR will expand Section 3.5.5 in the final document to clarify this link. 16. What is the difference between Zone A and Zone B contaminant source inventory? DENR will concentrate potential contaminant source inventory efforts in the most critical area near drinking water sources. Therefore, a comprehensive contaminant source inventory will be conducted in Zone A source water assessment areas. This includes using all existing information from DENR and outside agency databases listed in Table 3.2, page 35 of the draft document to complete an inventory. Field verification of potential contaminant sources will also be conducted in Zone A in some source water assessment areas. Public water supply systems operators will also be asked to supply potential contaminant source inventory information in Zone A source water assessment areas. A limited contaminant source inventory will be conducted in Zone B source water assessment areas. The inventory in these areas will only include regulated facilities or major nonpoint source potential contaminant sources.Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-11817. Define Zone A and Zone B assessment areas in the Black Hills region. Zone A in the Black Hills region includes a 0.25-mile assessment area along each perennial stream and all aquifer recharge areas. Depending on the hydrogeologic setting of the public water supply system, Zone A also includes an arbitrary fixed radius around the wellhead. Zone A in systems located in confined aquifers includes a 500-foot radius around the wellhead; Zone A in systems located in alluvial aquifers includes a 0.25-mile radius around the wellhead; and Zone A in systems located in fractured Precambrian bedrock includes a 0.5-mile radius around the wellhead. Zone B in the Black Hills region includes the remaining delineated watershed. 18. Does the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Program document include a map of the entire Black Hills region? Does the draft document contain a narrative description of the Black Hills region assessment methods? The draft document does not include a map of the entire Black Hills region; however, the document does contain hypothetical figures and narrative descriptions for all Black Hills hydrogeologic settings and assessment approaches. 19. Who has the authority to regulate potential contaminant sources in watershed areas? Although a potential contaminant source may have a high potential risk, the source is not necessarily a problem. If a potential contaminant source poses a problem, such as having a known contaminant release, the problem will be addressed at the state level. Depending on the nature of the problem, several agencies may be involved, including DENR. 20. How will DENR approach large agricultural holdings on private land in the \"blanket\" Black Hills region source water assessment? DENR will use Natural Resources Conservation Service land use information to identify large areas of agricultural nonpoint potential contaminant sources. All public water supply systems will receive an individual draft source water assessment for their system and will be asked to provide comments to the DENR. All systems will also be asked to provide additional potential contaminant source inventory information in their source water assessment areas. 21. Does the Zone A, 10-mile source water assessment area for surface water systems located outside the Black Hills region include tributaries? The proposed Zone A, 10-mile, 0.25-mile lateral assessment area will not be sufficient for public water supply systems located in the Aberdeen area. Zone A source water assessment areas include all perennial streams and tributaries up to 10 miles beyond the public water supply intake. The source water Technical Advisory Committee determined the 10-mile assessment area. The committee concluded that this set distance would be a sufficient assessment area for inventorying potential contaminant sources that may affect the water quality for most surface water systems in South Dakota. However, if communities wish to expand their assessment area, DENR will assist in customizing their source water assessment areas. 22. Will the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program protect private drinking water systems? A public water supply system is defined as any water system that serves 15 connections or 25 people per day for a minimum of 60 days per year. Unfortunately, time and resources are not available to conduct source water assessments for private drinking water systems. However, DENR will provide information to any private system wishing to design a source water protection program.Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-11923. What information can public water supply systems provide to DENR? Public water supply systems should start considering the locations of potential contaminant sources located near the water source that may pose a high potential risk. DENR will field verify potential contaminant sources in some source water assessment areas. 24. What community leaders will be required to pass information to the public? During the assessment process for each individual public water supply system, DENR will contact the specific system approximately one month before the assessment is to be finalized to solicit any comments on the draft assessment. Additionally, DENR will meet with any community that wishes to discuss the results of the assessment, including the procedures used to derive the assessments, and discuss implementation options. When the assessment has been finalized, DENR will send the prescribed information to the local public water supply officials. Assessment results will be available in both electronic and paper formats. This includes both the narrative and map portions of the assessments. DENR will also make all necessary assessment information available over South Dakota's Internet web page, so the information can be available to all citizens. Because Internet access may not be available to all individuals and communities, maps and reports will be available in paper format for communities and/or individuals that request the information in this form. Assessment information will be sent directly to public water supply operators, city mayors or councilmen, and interested citizens. DENR will encourage each local community to make the information available to all its citizens. For example, a notice can be placed in customer's water bills, in the system's consumer confidence report, or presented in some other outreach format which describes the availability of the source water assessment information and how it can be acquired. 25. Are water suppliers and communities responsible for contaminant source inventories? In addition to using existing information from the databases listed in Table 3.2 to conduct a potential contaminant source inventory in the assessment area, the department will also employ the assistance of a local representative, such as a water system operator and/or a community leader. For each assessment area, after the department has compiled and mapped the potential contaminant sources identified through the information in the databases, the mapped inventory will be sent to the local representative(s). The local representative will be asked, based on their knowledge of the local area, to verify the presence and locations of the potential contaminant sources and to identify the location of any additional sources that were not identified through the database search. As time and resources allow, the department will perform field verifications, which will include the identification of potential contaminant sources and locations by driving through the source water protection area. The department will obtain and record the locations of additional identified potential contaminant sources using global positioning system equipment or maps. 26. How large will the source water assessment area be for a well that is 50 feet below ground surface in an unconfined aquifer? The depth to ground water is 22 feet below ground surface. The public water supply system currently has a nitrate problem. A comprehensive effort using available hydrogeologic information will be applied to all sensitive, unconfined public water supply systems. However, the amount and quality of available hydrogeologic information will dictate the delineation method used. The delineation method for this system may include one or a combination of the following: hydrogeologic mapping, analytical methods, or calculated fixed radius. The size of wellhead protection areas in similar hydrogeologic settings in the eastern part of South Dakota typically range in size from 1 to 2 miles in length, and 0.5 to 1 mile in width. 27. I am a teacher and am finding that more and more teachers are becoming interested in water issues. Are there any provisions in this project to get information into our classrooms? Building awareness and waterAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-120management ethics in students is a lot of work, but it is the most far sighted approach to affecting change locally and statewide that will maintain and improve South Dakota surface water in the next century. Although DENR understands the importance of educating the public on water quality issues, DENR will not specifically concentrate on distributing source water assessment information into the public school system. However, source water assessment information is readily available to any teacher interested in discussing this topic in their classrooms. Information is available through the department Internet web site, http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/denr/DES/Ground/Sourcewater/sourcewater.htm, or through contacting the department at (605) 773-3296. 28. Can student groups get involved in collecting or evaluating source water assessment data? DENR may request assistance from university students to collect potential contaminant source inventory information. 29. What form of assistance/guidance will the DENR provide the water system operators in the development of their individual Source Water Protection Programs once the source water assessments are complete? My reason for asking the question stems back to a concern that I have regarding the ability of many system operators to develop source water protection programs for their systems. Although ground water professionals deal with groundwater issues almost daily, many of the operators we are talking about are not groundwater professionals or even employed by the water systems they serve. Many are, in fact, employed in other walks of life and volunteer their time to the operation of their system. As such, many water systems lack the manpower and resources necessary to develop a source water protection program. It is my fear that, without significant on-going participation by the DENR, the development of a non-mandatory protection program will just not happen for many systems and the efforts of the assessment activities will have been wasted. I would ask that you keep this in focus as a major goal of the Program. Question is partially addressed in #13. DENR acknowledges that many public water supply system operators may not have the background or resources to develop source water protection programs. However, all public water supply system operators and owners are encouraged to work with the local or regional planners and local community leaders to develop and implement protection measures. DENR will offer assistance and promote source water protection programs, but the PWSS must take the lead in developing such a program. Comments Jack Cole, Black Hills Water Rangers Next summer, the Black Hills Water Rangers hope to be accredited by the EPA. This group will be testing surface water in some of the major streams in the Black Hills and local domestic wells. The group intends to report the results of the testing to the EPA and the DENR. The commentator thanks DENR for developing the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program, and is elated and enthused about the program. Montana citizens have outlawed all open pit cyanide mining in the state of Montana because of polluted drinking water and serious problems, including deformed children. The commentator will send the list of problem mines that have polluted water to DENR. Commentator indicated DENR may want to contact these communities that have had serious problems to see what they have done to correct their problems. DENR will contact EPA for more information on problems resulting from open pit cyanide mining in Montana. Tim Stefanich, City of Sioux Falls In section 3.4.1.4: Non-sensitive Public Water Supply Systems on page 21 of the draft document, DENR should add a \"non\" in the following sentence: A minimum radius of 500 feet will be used for systems in confined aquifers that are greater than 100 feet below ground surface with a relatively extensive, low permeability confining layer or those determined ( non)- sensitive in the 1991 South Dakota Public Water Supply System Vulnerability Study. Commentator also suggests adding the following terms to the glossary: \" intrinsic \" and \" induced \"Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-121DENR will make the suggested changes in the final document. Jack Cole, Black Hills Water Rangers DENR may want to look closely at the Berkley open pit mine in Butte, Montana. This mine is similar to the open pit gold mine in Lead, SD. The Berkley pit has been filling up with water for 10 to 15 years and it is predicted that in 2 years it will pollute all the drinking water in that part of Montana. So far, EPA has spent $120 million trying to figure out the water problems. Commentator is not suggesting that the same problems will occur in Lead, but the open pits are very similar. DENR will contact EPA for more information regarding the Berkely open pit mine. Martin Jarrett, SD Water Congress Commentator is concerned about the amount of money and time spent to develop water protection programs. Commentator does not know of any public water source that has improved its raw water quality due to past programs, such as the Wellhead Protection Program. \"If we don't see change at the local level, let's not try to fool the taxpayers about spending their money, because we are going to spend it one way or the other. We are either going to spend it on making a change at the local level, or spend money on more water treatment. Those are the two choices we have.\" DENR agrees that source water protection programs are needed in South Dakota; however, local community members must spearhead these efforts. Bill Kerry, Butte Conservation District Be sure to involve the Conservation Districts in this assessment and in solving the problems, as the Conservation District supervisors are the ones with their feet on the ground in every area of each watershed on a continuing basis and are very knowledgeable. When distributing source water assessment information to the public water supply operator, city mayors and/or county officials, DENR will recommend these entities inform local conservation districts of the source water assessment availability. Barb Gillespie, interested public Commentator has lived on a farm for 37 years. The quality of water in her shallow wells is poor. She has had E. coli problems in her drinking water well, which has caused her to discontinue using the well for drinking water purposes. The well supplied a large amount of water. Shallow wells may not be the only wells affected; deep wells may be affected in the future if too much industry and agriculture is concentrated in one place. The land is fragile the further west one goes in the state, and may not always replenish itself. The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program will address both shallow and deep drinking water sources, and will identify any potential sources of pollution that may pose potential problems. However, the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is not designed to assess problems with private wells. The national Farmstead Assessment System ( Farm*A*Syst) \"is a voluntary program which helps farmers and rural residents protect ground water by reducing pollution risk on their property. Farm*A*Syst, and its companion program, Home*A*Syst, offers rural residents and farmers a way to protect groundwater, their source of drinking water by evaluating their property to identify potential hazards. Farm*A*Syst helps participants take action to reduce or eliminate those risks.\" For more information on this program, contact South Dakota's Farm*A*Syst coordinator at South Dakota State University, Box 2120 Brookings, SD 57007, phone (605) 688-5141, or view the Farm*A*Syst Internet website at http://www.wisc.edu/farmasyst/index.html. Mark Maher, CETEC Engineering Services, Inc . \"South Dakota will be treating the Black Hills as one region, which is appropriate. However, the local water suppliers and government will not be able to protect/manage areas outside of their area of jurisdiction without some assistance. It would be nice to have a \"water supplier alliance\" for the Black Hills region which may includeAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-122interested water suppliers, townships, and cities within Wyoming as well as South Dakota. Individually, each water system or town would not have much clout, but protection and management concerns could be addressed as an allied group. Perhaps a group could be formed under the American Water Works Association.\" Due to the potential overlap of source water assessment areas in the Black Hills region, DENR promotes the idea of forming a source water protection alliance among community members, local governments, and county officials in this region. Mike Meyer, GeoTek Engineering and Testing Services, Inc. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on the DENR's proposed source protection program. I support the DENR's efforts to protect public water supplies (PWS) from contamination. Prevention is much cheaper than clean- up. I would like to offer a few suggestions for your consideration. The source water protection program involves voluntary participation by the PWS. I am wondering if the DENR, perhaps in cooperation with the US EPA, might look into potential financial incentives to promote active involvement. For example, for PWS that develop an active program, perhaps some reduction in monitoring frequency (and/or parameters) might be considered. Because the program is voluntary, I suspect to be successful, every effort should be made to encourage local involvement. Ideally, this would include the DENR staff visiting selected PWS sites and meeting with local PWS staff, etc. to get their suggestions. I am aware the DENR cannot visit all 760 PWS. However, if you exclude the non-community PWS and the non- vulnerable community PWS, this should leave a workable number of PWS sites to visit. I think your chances of success are better if PWS staff think you are seeking their input rather than information being handed down to them from the DENR. The importance of face to face contact cannot be overestimated. I understand development of wellhead protection areas (WHPA) for community PWS typically involves preparation of an analytical type model (such as US EPA WHPA model with 10 year travel) to provide a map of the zone of influence. Such maps can be expected to be heavily relied upon for important decisions such as zoning, clean-up requirements etc. It is suggested the DENR consider working with others to perform field verification of a few selected vulnerable community PWS. A number of PWS (especially RWS) already have existing monitoring wells. It may be worthwhile preparing \"standard\" DENR WHPA maps based on typically available data (often sparse) to a few sites where monitoring wells, etc. are used to actually define the \"true\" zone of influence. This would enhance the credibility of the program. For example, the SDGS, USGS, or persons such as Arden Davis (SDSMT) or Pat Emmons (SDSU) might assist at a few sites to review field data and compare more sophisticated models (such as MODFLOW) to the analytical models. Financial incentives for PWS operator to voluntarily participate in the Source Water Protection Program already exist. Public water supply systems located in areas that are not susceptible to contamination from volatile organic chemicals (VOC), or synthetic organic chemicals (SOC), can apply for \"susceptibility\" or \"use\" waivers to reduce monitoring requirements. When applying for these waivers, public water supply systems are required to submit information such as potential contaminant sources, hydrogeologic information, well logs, and monitoring well data. For \"use\" waivers they must identify specific contaminant sources within a one-mile radius of the well. However, following the completion of the source water assessments, public water supply systems will be required to submit the above information for the entire source water assessment area. A majority of this information will be collected during the source water assessment process; thereby making the waiver submittal process less time consuming. The department agrees that the success of the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program is dependent on the willingness of drinking water suppliers and communities to be involved in the development and management of their source water protection area. South Dakota will contact every public water supply system approximately one month before the assessment is finalized, to solicit any comments on the draft assessment. Additionally, DENR willAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-123meet with any community that wishes to discuss the results of the assessment, including procedures used to derive the assessments, and discuss implementation options. Although DENR would like to field verify as many source water assessment areas as possible, the department does not have the time, money, or resources available to implement this project. All available information, including existing pump test results, water level measurements, and monitoring well data, will be used when delineating source water assessment areas. Public water supply systems and communities are encouraged to gather additional hydrologic or hydrogeologic data to assist with their delineation. Michael Schmidt, SD Cattlemen's Association The South Dakota Cattlemen's Association (SDCA) has reviewed the draft document South Dakota Water Assessment and Protection Program dated November 6, 1998 and wishes to offer comment. We appreciate the opportunity to provide our input into such a priority subject as insuring quality water in South Dakota and we thank you for this opportunity. Much of the document is quite technical in the nature of the material presented and while a lot of this technical data may be widely accepted in fields of expertise from which they are drawn we question if the proposed procedures to determine \"relative risk factor\" are the best available. We also realize that when applying these formulas to actual field conditions that Mother Nature is still in charge and often throws little quirks of nature at us. We also hope that when technicians, engineers, etc. apply these formulas to actual field conditions that these qualified people also realize Mother Natures propensity to provide these quirks and be willing to adjust accordingly . Some of the variables in the formulas are determined from sampling procedures and we request that these procedures be standardized if they are not. Often times a sample of water taken from the top of an aquifer is quite different from one drawn deeper into the aquifer. We are not advocating any one procedure over the other but we are asking for standardization within accepted guidelines. SDCA has in force Resolution 98-35 Local Control that was again reviewed and passes at our annual meeting this year. It reads in part: \"Resolved, That if involvement of governmental agencies and regulation is deemed necessary to address a problem or concern, SDCA work to keep the involved level of government and the decision making process as close to the problem as is reasonably feasible; \" We welcome that fact that this issue being addressed at the state level. Many of these watersheds cross many smaller governmental jurisdictional boundaries and we feel that the state level is high enough to transcend many of these boundaries yet close and responsive enough to the citizens of the state to address problems in a timely and efficient manner. SDCA has one major concern about this draft document. Section 3.6.4 Risk Factor Values lays out the ground work and formulas for producing a relative risk factor for a given operation such as an animal feeding operation. Again we trust that the tables and formulas used in this mathematical process are based in generally accepted and verified disciplines. Our major concern is, that when this relative risk factor is determined, how is this risk factor going to be used. For example, if an animal feeding operation receives a determined score in the moderate range in Table 3.3 will this mean that the operation will automatically be subjected to an inspection such as those possible under the general permitting process? While we recognize the need to sometimes determine a relative number such as this relative risk factor we have serious concerns about who is going to have access to this information and how it is going to be used when it is developed. We believe that this issue needs to be addressed and maybe some safe guards put in place as to how this data is used and distributed. Reviewing the number and types of examples that are given in the text for determining \"relative risk factor\" we note that a majority of them are applied to agricultural practices and some of our members are questioning if this means that agriculture is being targeted in this effort. Agricultural producers are rural residents and in that capacity clean water is important to agriculture also. We do not want to be singled out as the \"only\" possible source of contamination under this assessment.Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-124To help resolve some of these issues some SDCA members would be willing to meet with DENR to discuss some of them face to face. That being the case we request such a meeting. Hopefully a time and place can be agreed upon to accomplish such a meeting. The South Dakota Cattlemen's Association appreciates this opportunity and thanks you for considering our input. DENR met with the SD Cattleman's Association (SDCA) on January 21, 1999 to discuss their concerns. A representative from the SD Pork Producers Council and a representative from South Dakota State University also attended the meeting. DENR anticipated many of the concerns expressed by the SDCA and attempted to solicit the potential concerns of the agricultural community by including a representative of Ag Unity on the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Technical Advisory Committee (TAC). DENR was unaware that the SDCA and the Pork Producers Council are not members of Ag Unity. However, to gather additional input from an agricultural viewpoint, DENR also used both the Board of Water and Natural Resources and Water Management Board as the Citizens Advisory Committee; members of these Boards have an agricultural background. The SDCA questioned DENR for not including a representative from South Dakota State University on the TAC. However, a university representative from South Dakota School of Mines & Technology was on the TAC. DENR discussed the SDCA concerns of public access to the source water assessment information and how the information will be used. DENR explained the source water assessment report will be provided to the public water supply system owner/operator and to a local community elected official . The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires the reports to be made available to the general public. To meet this requirement, South Dakota plans to make the reports available via the State Internet website. The SDCA concern about having safe guards in place for the use and distribution of the information generated through the source water assessments is also a concern for DENR. Therefore, the source water assessments will not have detailed information regarding the public water supply system well and intake locations, nor will the reports include the business names or addresses of the potential contaminant sources. However, these items will be shown on a map and referenced by an identifying number. DENR explained that the purpose of performing a source water assessment is to provide the local elected officials with a means to prioritize their initial source water management and protection efforts for their individual public water supply system. DENR has no intentions of using the susceptibility ratings as a prioritization for inspections. DENR discussed the standardization of the Source Water Assessment methods with the SDCA. The desire by the department for standardization shows in the level of technical detail presented in the draft plan. Unfortunately, however, the amount of relevant information is not consistently available for each water system. Therefore, the level of complexity of the source water delineations will vary, depending upon the nature of the system and the amount of available information. DENR discussed the SDCA concern that the professionals conducting the assessments acknowledge that field conditions may vary and should adjust the assessments accordingly. The department acknowledges field conditions will vary. For example, information obtained from site-specific borings may not corroborate with aquifer boundaries shown on geologic maps. Therefore, the department will ask the local elected officials and public water supply system operators for their assistance in gathering site-specific information that may not be available at the state level. The amount of flexibility afforded to the professional for determining the susceptibility ratings will be limited to the guidelines set forth in the draft SWAP plan. The EPA requires, and DENR is committed to, the principle that the susceptibility analysis must not result in arbitrary and capricious ratings. DENR, with the assistance of the participating members of the TAC, developed the table of risk factor values in Appendix S with standardization in mind. DENR discussed the SDCA concern of sampling methods that may affect the susceptibility analysis. Sampling methods may affect the susceptibility analysis if concentrations of similar contaminants have been measured at the well or intake. This information will be obtained from compliance monitoring required by each public water supply system. Compliance monitoring requirements are standardized within DENR. DENR does not anticipate installingAppendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-125new monitoring wells or advancing additional borings as part of the State's assessment effort, and will not be sampling private wells as part of the assessment effort. SDCA commented that agriculture appears to be targeted in the source water examples in the draft SWAP document. DENR acknowledges that there was a larger number of agricultural potential contaminant sources in the examples, however, DENR does not intend to specifically target agricultural practices. All identified potential pollution sources will be evaluated equally. DENR will add additional examples using non-agricultural potential contaminant sources. The SDCA asked that each susceptibility rating be sent to the individual potential contaminant source owner for their review and comment before the final source water assessment report is published. DENR revised the susceptibility analysis so that the public water supply system will receive an overall susceptibility rating. This overall susceptibility rating may be published in the final report rather than an individual susceptibility rating for each potential contaminant source. In addition, DENR revised the susceptibility analysis so that regulated potential contaminant source in compliance with Local, State and Federal regulations will receive a deduction up to 15- points from the overall susceptibility rating. The 15-point deduction will reflect the decrease in risk from facilities that are less likely to cause pollution due to regulatory controls. DENR discussed the SDCA concern of who will have access to the susceptibility analysis information. DENR explained each potential contaminant source identified will have a high, moderate, or low rating; however, this information will not be presented in the final source water assessment report. If, however, questions arise regarding the susceptibility rating of a particular facility, the rating, calculations and other details regarding the susceptibility analysis may be made available to the requestor. In addition, although business names will not be presented in the assessment reports, local government agencies may need specific information about a potential contaminant source. Subject to the mandates and rules of the Freedom of Information Act, specific information regarding potential contaminant sources, such as the items noted above, will be made available to the public upon written request. The SDCA suggested adding an additional category to the risk factor, \"Pollution Prevention Measures in Place?\" The SWAP plan includes the following characteristics: \"unknown\", \"no\", \"some measures in place\", and \"yes\". DENR feels an additional factor is not needed due to the 15-point, regulatory compliance credit. SDCA is concerned that local communities will have the authority to change the susceptibility analysis method. Therefore, SDCA suggested revising the following sentence in the draft SWAP plan, \"However, local communities will be encouraged to refine these susceptibility analysis with DENR guidance and assistance, possibly by considering these and other factors not included, to suit the individual community needs.\" DENR deleted this sentence from the SWAP plan. SDCA suggested adding a section to the draft SWAP plan that protects the potential contaminant source owner from frivolous complaints. The SDCA reconsidered this suggestion and later decided against requesting the addition of this section. The SDCA would like to review and comment any changes to the susceptibility analysis, and would like to meet with DENR after EPA has provided comments on the draft SWAP plan. Scott Kenner, SD School of Mines and Technology My main concern is timing. Currently the levels of delineation and evaluation are qualitative. My meaning is that they take into account the areas that are readily linked to source waters but there is limited consideration of the actual travel time. For example, the corridor along the creek is identified through the whole reach. However there may be a location in a watershed that can contribute to the creek as soon or sooner than the upper reaches. I realize the effort and time the state has to do this and believe you have a starting point. I also feel there needs to be great care in presenting the results in that they to not necessarily identify all high level concerns and do not represent true response times. The logic may be better presented as the starting point upon which more detail can be added or developed as the potential problem(s) identified are understood.Appendix F 2: Public Meetings Summary and Comments, November 18, 1998 A-126Therefore, I am not disagreeing with the approach, but feel strongly about how the results will be presented. There needs to be a full understanding of the initial level of delineation and that more detailed efforts can be used as needed. The department agrees that the assessment methods described in the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Plan represent a point with which every community can start a source water protection program . The department also agrees that, for surface water systems, the delineated source water areas may not necessarily represent response times, nor will they necessarily identify all high level concerns. Every community has its own needs and that, combined with the fact that every setting is unique, behooves each community to evaluate whether or not their assessment meets their needs, when the assessments become available. If the assessment does not meet their needs, the department encourages the communities to supplement the assessments, if necessary, with assistance from the department. The possibility of using time-of-travel for surface water systems was discussed during the May 28, 1998 technical advisory committee meeting. It was noted during the meeting that this method would be useful if the purpose of the delineation is to inform the public water supply operator of a contamination spill. However, the time to travel from one location to another will depend on the contaminant spilled; contaminants travel at different rates. In addition, surface time-of-travel also depends on a number of other variable factors, such as slope, soil type, and stream flow rates. A simple calculation of gradient can be used to estimate time of travel for each system. In addition, the possibility of using time-of-travel was discussed during the Ad Hoc Technical Advisory Committee meeting convened to discuss the delineation methods to be used in the Black Hills. During that meeting, it was discussed that the travel times in the Black Hills area may be too fast to accurately utilize protection measures. Considering the time constraints by EPA to complete this program, members of the committee felt the DENR proposed method is a good start to the delineations, and once more information for each system is known - such as time of travel and potential contaminant sources - a more advanced, detailed method may be used.A-127Appendix G Workshops and Seminars DATE WORKSHOP /INVITEES (DENR W ORKSHOPS and Protection Program Guidance Workshop60 PWS operators, Water Development District Managers, Federal Agency Representatives, Tribal environmental coordinators, agricultural organizations, and environmental groups. 12/10/97 SD Association of Rural Water Systems' Source Water Protection Workshop130 PWS operators, Water Development District Managers, Environmental Consultants, EPA, Academia, Community Planners, RWS Assn. 2/3/98 Safe Drinking Water Act Seminar 100 PWS Operators and Managers, EPA, RWS Assn., Environmental Consultants, City officials 2/4/98 American Water Works Association Annual Seminar35 City Planners, Public Water Work Directors 2/11/98 Water Treatment and Distribution Operators Seminar75 PWS Operators and Managers, Water Development District Managers, RWS Assn., EPA, Contractors, Consultants, Academia 3/19/98 Nonpoint Source Task Force Meeting 25 Federal Agency Representatives, agricultural organizations 3/19/98 SD DENR 10th Annual Ground Water Quality Conference80 Environmental Consultants, Local Governments, Academia, Federal Agencies 4/22/98 SD School of Mines &Technology Water Resources Forum40 Academia, Federal Agency Representatives, Students, PWS Managers 6/30/98 Missouri River Corridor Action Team Meeting15 Federal Agency Representatives, City Planners 10/21/98 SD Water Congress 20 Water Development Districts Managers, PWS Managers, Rural Water System Managers, City Officials, State Officials, Public Officials 11/18/98 DENR SWAP Public Meeting 130 Environmental groups, local governments, health organizations, PWS, Indian officials, agricultural organizations, federal officials, and universities. 12/16/98 SD Association of Rural Water Systems' Wellhead Protection Workshop25 PWS Operators and Managers, Water Development District Managers, Environmental Consultants 1/12/99 SD Association of Rural Water Systems' 24th Annual Technical Conference70 PWS operators, Water Development District Managers, Environmental Consultants 2/3/99 American Water Works Association Annual Seminar70 PWS operators, Water Development District Managers, Environmental Consultants 2/26/99 South Dakota Planners Association Workshop30 State, Regional, County, and City officials, mostly those involved with planning 3/9/99 SD DENR 11th Annual Ground Water Quality Conference80 Environmental Consultants, Local Governments, Academia, Federal AgenciesA-129Appendix H Source Water Assessment and Protection Information Presented in the following Newsletters, Publications, and Press Releases Date Newsletter or Publication June 30, 1997 DENR Press Release Summer 1997 Article in Clarifier Volume 63, Number 2 April 7, 1998 Source Water Assessment fact sheet sent to all community and non-transient non-community public water supply system operators and mayors Summer 1998 Article in Clarifier Volume 64, Number 2 November 4, 1998 Publications of public meeting notice on the draft Source Water Assessment and Protection Program Document.

Over 60 local, state, and tribal officials met to discuss EPA's new State Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. Congress created the State Source Water Assessment and Protection Program last August as an amendment to the federal Safe Drinking Water Act. The amendment requires states to develop programs aimed at preventing pollution from contaminating surface and underground public water supply sources. South Dakota is required to submit a Source Water Assessment and Protection Program to EPA within 18 months. Following program approval from EPA, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will be required to conduct assessments for over 750 public water systems. These assessments will include defining the area contributing water to a public supply, conducting an inventory of potential contaminant sources and determining the vulnerability of the water supply. \" We look forward to working with the local and tribal drinking water communities on this important new program,\" said Nettie Myers, Secretary of DENR. The assessments should be completed within 2 to 4 years and will be available to the public. DENR plans several public meetings in the future to gather input into a state assessment program. For more information, contact Jeanne Goodman at (605) 773-3296. Fact sheet sent to all community and non-transient non-community public water supply system operators and mayors: Most drinking water systems in South Dakota depend on ground water for their source of drinking water. However, there are other public drinking water systems that depend on surface water supplies for their drinking water, such as lakes and streams. In either case, it is likely that the drinking water system is using that source because there is not another reliable, high quality source of water available. Therefore, to protect the future of our state, it is important to protect our water supplies from potential contaminant sources. The federal 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act's \"Source Water Assessment and Protection Program\" utilizes pollution prevention measures that focus on protecting the area surrounding a public drinking water supply. This program requires each state to identify existing and potential pollution sources that may impact the quality of public drinking water supplies. The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources is coordinating this effort for our state.Appendix H: Newsletters, Publications, and Press Releases A-130A Source Water Assessment must be completed for each of the 760 public drinking water systems in South Dakota. This includes outlining or delineating the part of the watershed or ground water area that contributes water to the water supply; identifying the potential sources of pollution in those areas; and determining the susceptibility of the water supply to these pollution sources. Local communities, working in cooperation with state agencies, can use the information gathered through the assessment process to address current problems and prevent future problems to the quality of their drinking water supplies. To receive input from all interested parties, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will be holding public meetings to obtain comments on the development of the plan for conducting the assessments. The results of the Source Water Assessments for each public water supply will be made available to the public.

Clarifier Article Volume 64, Number 2 The first Technical Advisory Committee Meeting for the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program was held on April 1, 1998 in Pierre. The Source Water Assessment Program (SWAP), a requirement of the federal 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act, utilizes pollution prevention measures that focus on protecting the area surrounding a public drinking water supply. This includes outlining or delineating the part of the watershed or ground water area that contributes water to the water supply; identifying the potential sources of pollution in those areas; and determining the susceptibility of the water supply to these pollution sources. These activities collectively comprise a source water assessment. Local communities, working in cooperation with state agencies, can use the information gathered through the assessment process to address current problems and prevent future problems to the quality of their drinking water supplies. The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has organized a Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) to advise the department in the development of South Dakota's Source Water Assessment and Protection Program. Along with DENR expertise, the TAC also consists of representatives from American Water Works Association, East Dakota Water Development District, West Dakota Water Development District, SD Water Congress, US Geological Survey, and the US Environmental Protection Agency, among others. The first meeting of the TAC was held on April 1, 1998. Items that were discussed included the following: a prioritization method for conducting assessments for the 760 public water supply systems in South Dakota; a plan on how the public will be informed of the results of the SWAP program; a discussion of the data available to conduct the assessments, and data available to inventory potential contaminant sources in a source water protection area. Additional TAC meetings are tentatively scheduled for May 28, July 9, and September 10, 1998 in Pierre. To receive input from all interested parties, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will also be holding public meetings to obtain comments on the development of the plan for conducting the assessments. The results of the Source Water Assessments for each public water supply will be made available to the public. For additional information on this federally required program, please contact Tricia Sebes of the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources at the Joe Foss Building, 523 E. Capitol, Pierre, 3296, Press Releases A-131November 12, 1998 Governor Janklow Press Release PIERRE - To help protect drinking water supplies in South Dakota, Governor Bill Janklow is inviting the public to comment on the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources' (DENR) draft of its Source Water Assessment Program. \"We want to hear comments and suggestions from the people of South Dakota, including the agricultural, commercial, residential and industrial sectors regulated by DENR,\" Janklow said. \"It will help us make sure we're doing everything we can to protect our drinking water.\" The Source Water Assessment Program will determine the methods DENR uses to identify possible sources of contamination to the 760 public drinking water systems in the state. The Source Water Assessments include defining the most critical area around a water source, inventorying potential pollution sources, and determining the vulnerability of the water supply to those inventoried sources. The public input meetings will be held over the RDTN network on Wednesday, November 18th. Two meetings will be held, the first from 3:00 pm - 5:30 pm, the second from 8:00 pm - 10:00 pm (all times central). The meetings will be carried at RDTN sites in Aberdeen, Brookings, Madison, Mitchell, Pierre, Rapid City, Sioux Falls, Spearfish, Vermillion, Watertown and Yankton. The meetings will include an overview of the department's proposed Source Water Assessment Program plan and a question and answer session, followed by time for citizens to offer comments and suggestions regarding the proposed plan. Public input will be included in the DENR's final Source Water Assessment Program plan that will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval.

To ensure that the water supply is safe and to avoid costly treatment or relocation of their supply, the local community must be aware of the activities that could adversely impact their drinking water source. A program designed to help communities address potential sources of contamination to their ground water is called Source Water Assessment and Protection . The Source Water Protection Program involves the protection of public water supplies by managing the critical areas contributing water to a ground water well or surface water intake. Before a community can effectively protect its drinking water supply from potential sources of pollution in those critical areas, it must first know where those potential sources of pollution are located. The Source Water Assessment Program is intended to provide information regarding the location of pollution sources in the water source area and the relative risk of contamination to the drinking water supply posed by the potential pollution sources. The 1996 federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments require every state to develop a Source Water Assessment Program. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is coordinating this effort in South Dakota. The program requirements include involving the public throughout the development of the assessment program; developing a strategy to complete assessments for the approximately 760 public water supply systems in South Dakota; and developing a strategy for making the results of the assessments available to the public when completed. Local communities, working in cooperation with state agencies, can use the information gathered through the assessment process to reduce future threats to the quality of their drinking water supplies. A source water assessment is a three-step process that includes delineating the part of the watershed or ground water area that contributes water to the water supply; identifying the significant potential sources of drinking water contamination in those areas; and rating the water supply's susceptibility to contamination from those sources. An assessment must be completed for each of the approximately 760 public water supply systems in South Dakota. South Dakota's Wellhead Protection Program will serve as the basis for assessing public drinking water systems supplied by ground water. A combination of wellhead protection delineation methods will be used to define source water assessment areas depending on the type of public water supply system. The delineated assessment area for surface water systems will extend 10 river miles upstream from the surface water intake. Additionally, a one-half mile-wide contributing zone extending laterally beyond any upstream alluvial aquifer will also be delineated to provide for an adequate evaluation of potential threats to a particular surface water supply. An inventory of potential contaminant sources located within the source water assessment area is necessary for proper source water protection, management, and planning. With this information, a community can manage its source water protection area with a better understanding of the potential impacts to its drinking water supply. The level of effort for the potential contaminant source inventory will be based on geographic location relative to the drinking water well or intake, and the available resources including time, money, and personnel. To help manage the potential contaminant source identification, local governments and community leaders will be encouraged to assist with the inventory around their water supply. A susceptibility analysis will be conducted to determine the susceptibility of a public water supply system to each of the potential contaminant sources identified in the source water assessment area. Susceptibility is defined as the potential for a public water supply system to draw water contaminated at concentrations that would pose concern in the well or surface -water intake. This program potentially affects every public drinking water supply in South Dakota. In order to receive input regarding the program from the general public and other stakeholders such as business owners and water supply operators, DENR held two public meetings on November 18, 1998 at 11 Rural Development Telecommunication Network sites throughout the state. The meetings included an overview of the proposed Source Water Assessment and Protection Program plan, followed by a comment period where citizens voiced their concerns regarding the proposed plan. The final deadline for submitting comments to the DENR on the proposed program was December 18, 1998. Input from the public will be addressed in South Dakota's final proposed Source Water Assessment andAppendix H: Newsletters, Publications, and Press Releases A-133Protection Program plan that will be submitted to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for approval in February 1999. South Dakota's anticipated date for completion of all source water assessments is May 2003. DENR encourages local communities to work in cooperation with local citizens and landowners to use the collected assessment information to establish local source water protection programs that fit local needs and which will provide long-term protection of their drinking water supplies. For more information on the Source Water Assessment and Protection Program, visit DENR's website at http://www.state.sd.us/state/executive/denr/DES/Ground/Sourcewater/sourcewater.htm , or contact Tricia Sebes, DENR Ground Water Quality Program, at (605) 773-3296. November 26, 1999 DENR Press Release PIERRE -The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources is moving forward with a plan to better protect the sources of water for South Dakota's more than 700 public drinking water systems. The Source Water Assessment and Protection Program outlines methods for identifying critical areas around each public drinking water system's water source, inventorying potential sources of pollution near the water sources, and determining how susceptible each water source is to contamination. The plan calls for the studies to be completed by May 2003. Annual consumer confidence reports for drinking water quality will announce the availability of the studies as they are completed. Local communities can use the information gathered through the studies to take steps to protect current and future threats to the quality of their drinking water. South Dakota is the first state in the Rocky Mountain region to have its program approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The federal agency said the state program \"will significantly enhance ongoing efforts to protect waters used as sources of drinking water. . .\" \"We are pleased to receive EPA approval of this plan,\" said DENR Secretary Nettie H. Myers. \"The input and advice that we received from our technical advisory committee, the Board of Water and Natural Resources, the Water Management Board, and from individual citizens made the plan approvable and yet it is a plan that fits South Dakota.\" Members of the 22-person technical advisory committee included representatives from various water organizations, water development districts, agriculture organizations, cities, health groups, and universities, and scientists and engineers from federal and state agencies. States are required to develop a Source Water Protection Program as part of the amendments to the 1996 federal Safe Drinking Water Act .A-135Appendix I US Geological Survey 8-Digit Hydrologic Unit Code A-137Appendix J Key for Appendices K, L, M, N, O, P Note: Non-Black Hills region ground water public water supply systems are in Appendices J-M, Non-Black Hills region surface water public water supply systems are in Appendix N, and all Black Hills public water supply systems are in Appendix O.
