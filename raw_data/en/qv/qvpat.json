Stuifbergen This cross sectional study described the relationship between quality of life (QOL) and self-transcendence (ST) in liver transplant recip ients. Self -transcendence is a dynamic process reflecting spiritual growth and maturity and a broadening of personal perspective during challenging life experiences. Illness distress, fatigue, age, gender, marital status, education, and time -since-transpla nt were also investigated relative to QOL. Participants (n = 471) were primarily Caucasian (86.5%), male (53.5%), married (73.5%), religiously affiliated (93.4%), and perceived their health status as \"good\" (48%) or \"excellent\" (19%). Participants with t he highest ST scores (M = 3.36, S.D. = .37, possible range 1 -4) were female, older (65 -79 years), or recently transplanted (< 2 years). Females reported significantly higher ST scores than males. Participants with the highest QOL scores (M = 23.73, S.D. = 4.88, possible range = 0 -30) were female, older (65 -79 years), and transplanted 3 -5 years ago. Strong relationships existed between QOL and ST scores (r = .51, p < .01), illness distress and fatigue scores (r = .51, p < .01), and QOL and illness distres s scores (r = -.71, p < .01). Moderate relationships existed between QOL and fatigue scores (r = -.45, p < .01) and ST and illness distress scores (r = -.36, p < .01). Self-transcendence and fatigue scale scores had a weak relationship (r = -.20, p < .01). viii Illness distress scores were low (M = 15.30; SD = 13.47, possible range 0 -88) as were fatigue scores (M = 4.23; SD = 2.04, possible range 1 -10). Regression analysis revealed illness distress, ST, fatigue, and age accounted for 60% of the variance in QOL s cores. Most respondents reported post -transplant QOL as better than expected. Comorbidities had a major impact on post -transplant QOL. Financial resources were adequate. Multiple factors were cited as important to QOL including family, friends, health, sp irituality, productivity, happiness, and job security. This study suggests self -rated QOL and ST are high for liver transplant recipients while illness distress and fatigue are low. Females have significantly higher ST scores than males. Self -transcende nce, illness distress, fatigue, and age are important factors related to QOL and should be further investigated. ix TABLE OF CONTENTS LIST OF TABL ES

Conceptual framewor k of the relationship between liver transplantation, self - transcendence, and quality ONE INTRODUCTION Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis is ranked as the tenth le ading cause of death in the United States (Murphy, 2000). Liver transplantation is the most effective therapy available for treatment of chronic liver failure (Coleman, Mendoza, & Bindon -Perler, 1991; Wainwright, 1994), yet it is the most time -consuming an d costliest of all transplantations (Hockerstedt, 1990). While liver transplantation in recent years has become recognized as a highly successful intervention for treating liver failure (UNOS, 1997b), recipients are still at increased risk of death followi ng transplantation due to the side effects associated with the chronic immunosuppressants required to prevent organ rejection (Smith & Wittman, 1997). The experience of receiving a liver transplant is an overwhelming and frightening experience. Prior to t ransplantation, the individual is faced with the reality of impending death. Following transplantation, the transplant recipient must face the possibility of organ rejection or associated complications that can still result in early death. As a result, liver transplant recipients often grapple with their mortality leading to a heightened awareness of their spirituality (Thomas, 1993b). Often, the transplant recipient struggles with the spiritual challenge of finding meaning and purpose in their transplant experience. While little study has focused on the relationship between spiritual issues and quality of life (QOL) for this population, the challenges associated with the economic, ethical, social, and physical impact of transplantation are known to have a significant effect on 2 transplant recipients' QOL. Attitude toward illness, perceived control over health, and severity of impairment are known to influence an individual's QOL (Bradbury & Catanzaro, 1989). Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers (1976) suggest dem ographic factors such as age, marital status, income, and condition -related variables also correlate with QOL. Attitudes towards self, life and the future; the ability to perform normal physical and work activities; and the presence of family and social su pport are other constructs associated with QOL (Padilla, Grant, & Ferrell, 1992), all of which have been cited as important aspects of recovery for liver transplant recipients. While gaining the opportunity for a prolonged life, liver transplant recipient s still grapple on a daily basis with the challenges of chronicity. The reality of a \"healthy\" life as they have known it previously is now changed. Persistent symptoms of illness distress associated with the required immunosuppression (Everson & Kam, 1997 ), assimilation of the transplanted organ (Beidel, 1987), and issues of changing body image (Everhart et al., 1998; Surman, 1994) are common daily challenges. Fatigue is a particularly prevalent symptom in this patient population (Commander, Neuberger, & D ean 1992; Noyes et al., 1990; Paris et al., 1997; & Wainwright, 1997). Additional post -transplant issues of employment discrimination (Paris et al.), economic burden (Lange, 1992), and the continuous possibility of organ rejection (Surman) also plague this patient population. Self-transcendence (ST), a dynamic process reflecting individual spiritual growth and maturity, is known to be associated with QOL. Self -transcendence was found to be greater in persons facing end -of-life issues and was positively r elated to indicators of well-being (Reed, 1991b). Important outcomes of self -transcendence include a new 3 perspective or new definition of reality for the individual (Tornstam, 1996, 1997), a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in life (Coward, 1990a, 1994 ; Noble, 1987; Tornstam, 1997); acceptance of personal circumstances (Chinen, 1986; Coward, 1990a), a positive personal death perspective (Smith, 1995; Tornstam; Young & Reed, 1995); emotional well -being (Haase, Kline Leidy, , Giordano, Dupuy, & Puhakka, 1995; Young & Reed), and healing (Coward & Reed, 1996; Reed, 1996). Proposed barriers to ST include fatigue or lack of energy (Coward, 1990a; Coward & Lewis, 1993), undeveloped spiritual perspective (Haase et al.; Reed, 1987), repression (McKenzie, 1991), stability in life circumstances (Haase et al.; Reed, 1987), lack of acceptance of challenging life circumstances (Haase et al.), or cognitive impairments that prevent developmental maturity and self -awareness. These barrie rs and outcomes of ST would seem to have particular relevance to the QOL experience for liver transplant recipients. Purpose Due to the expense and limited resources associated with liver transplantation, reductions in morbidity and mortality are no longe r sole justifications for this life -saving medical procedure. It is imperative improved QOL be demonstrated as an outcome associated with liver transplantation and interventions to enhance QOL be identified. Persons making decisions about allocation of don or organs, those caring for patients throughout the transplant experience, and most importantly, family, friends, and the transplant candidate, must also clearly understand the realistic expectations for QOL associated with the many different aspects of li ver transplantation. 4 The purpose of this study was to describe the relationship between ST and QOL in liver transplant recipients. Levels of ST and QOL were studied for cohorts grouped according to time since transplantation. In addition, the relationship between demographic factors, illness distress, level of fatigue, ST, and QOL were also explored. Background and Significance of Study Self-transcendence, a dimension of spirituality, is a dynamic process associated with critical life events (Hanna et al ., 1995; Reed 1986, 1991b). The process of ST involves normalization (acceptance) of death, identification of meaning in life, identification of meaning in death, and value of one's life beyond the physical, psychological, or social self (Smith, 1995). Th e ST experience can be therapeutic as the individual experiences the psychological change associated with the ST process (Hanna et al.). Several authors (Coward, 1990a; Joffrien & Douglas, 1994) specify ST requires energy or effort, raising the question as to whether patients suffering from weakness and fatigue have the capacity to achieve ST. This notion also suggests restoration of the individual's physical, mental, or spiritual energy could increase ST. Falhberg, Wolfer, and Fahlberg (1992) suggest ST re sults as a response to a spiritual emergency (such as spiritual distress) or spiritual emergence (such as spiritual growth) in an individual's life. Liver transplantation can be seen as precipitating either a spiritual emergency as the individual faces the ir mortality or a spiritual emergence as the individual develops a heightened response to their spirituality during this life challenge. Antecedents of ST include life crises or experiences that foster developmental changes such as suffering, death, or ps ychological turmoil (Baird, 1992; Coward & 5 Lewis, 1993; Hanna al., Kahn, 1987). Kuuire suggests a life -crisis provides a focused opportunity for transcende nce, particularly in individuals who did not previously develop their spiritual dimension. The experience of illness, for example, often leads individuals to transcend the illness experience (Wainwright, 1997). While some study has been given to QOL in l iver transplant recipients, most research has addressed limited aspects of QOL related to functional or socioeconomic status. Psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions of QOL, however, may also be important aspects of QOL that deserve further investi gation in the liver transplant population. Since nurses provide a majority of the health care services required by liver transplant recipients throughout their lifespan (Smith & Wittman, 1997), nurses caring for liver transplant recipients need to understa nd more about the dynamic process of ST and its relationship to QOL. Data are needed to identify the occurrence of ST in this patient population, when these patients are most likely to experience changes in ST, and interventions that will facilitate this p rocess. Likewise, nurses must clearly understand the dynamic process of QOL and identify ways to facilitate higher QOL for liver transplant recipients. Nurses also need understanding about why some liver transplant recipients tend to experience greater ST and QOL, factors associated with ST and QOL, and strategies to support and enhance ST and QOL. Knowledge about the periods of post -transplantation when ST and QOL are more likely to be enhanced or challenged will help nurses more accurately prepare patien ts and their families for the post -transplant experience. 6 Statement of problem Self-transcendence has been shown to be an important spiritual process particularly relevant to QOL during end -of-life experiences (Chinen, 1986; Coward, Riley, & Erlen, 1997; Reed, 1991b). Despite the relevance of ST to the liver transplant experience, no studies of ST in liver transplant recipients have been identified in literature searches. In addition, no studies regarding the relationship between ST and QOL as conceptualized by Ferrans and Powers (1992) have been reported for the liver transplant population. Inconsistencies in previous QOL studies of the liver transplant population also contribute to a lack of understanding regarding the experiences and outcomes of liver transplant recipients relative to QOL. Significant methodological limitations in most of the documented studies include a lack of standardized psychometric instruments, use of small study sampl es, study of only short spans of time (eg., 1 -2 years post -transplant), retrospective data collection, and lack of attention to comorbid problems associated with end-stage liver disease (Lumby, 1997; Tarter, 1998). This study was proposed to fill some of the gaps in current knowledge by measuring the relationship between ST and QOL in liver transplant recipients. The study also examined the process of ST and QOL in liver transplant recipients over time as reflected by changes in ST scores and QOL scores i n cohorts grouped according to time since transplantation. Demographic data found to be significant in other studies (e.g., age, gender, level of illness distress, and level of fatigue) were analyzed for relationships to the variables of interest. 7 Concept ual framework The conceptual framework for this study was based on the theoretical perspectives and research findings contributed by several scholars as well as clinical observations reported in the health care literature. Conceptualization of ST was particularly influenced by the previous work of Reed (1986, 1987, 1991a, 1991b, 1992, 1996). The QOL work of Ferrans and Powers (Ferrans, 1990, 1994; Ferrans & Powers, 1985) served as the basis for the theoretical approach to QOL. Fatigue, a symptom often repor ted by liver transplant recipients, was explored within the model since fatigue has been proposed by several authors (Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Hanna et al., 1995; Joffrion & Douglas, 1994) as a hindrance to the development of ST. The illness distress associated with liver transplantation is also seen as important in QOL and was investigated. The proposed theoretical model (Figure 1) represents a correlation between ST and QOL. In the presence of a life -altering event, such as liver transplantation resul ting from organ failure, the organ recipient may experience either a spiritual emergency or spiritual emergence in response to their life crisis. In the presence of this life challenge, ST can develop, helping the individual to successfully face the overw helming crisis. As ST develops, the organ recipient identifies the personal meaning and purpose of the transplant experience for their life. Outcomes of the process of ST for the transplant recipient include a sense of life satisfaction and well -being refl ected as the individual's level of QOL. 8 Spiritual emergency or Spiritual emergence Self-transcendence Acceptance Meaning Purpose Quality of life Life-satisfaction Well-being + Liver failure Crisis Life challenge Figure 1. Conceptual framework of the relationship between liver transplant ation, self-transcendence, and quality of life. Liver transplant recipient Fatigue Illness distress Age Gender Income Marital status Employment status Educational level Time-since- transplant Health status Social support Chronicity Enhanced sense of mortality 9 Self-transcendence According to Reed (1991b), ST is \"a characteristic of developmental maturity whereby there is an expansion of self -boundaries and an orientation toward broadened life perspective and purposes\" (p. 64). Self -transcendence involves connectedness with self, others, and a Higher Power. It is important to note Reed uses \"end -of-own-life experiences\" versus \"age\" to delineate the developmental context for ST. Coward (1990a, 1 994) similarly defines ST as the capacity to reach out beyond oneself, to extend oneself beyond personal concerns, and to take on broader life perspective, activities, and purposes. Reed's (1991b) ST theory proposes: 1) the human being, as a open system, defines reality and provides a sense of wholeness and connectedness between the environment and himself by imposing conceptual boundaries on his openness; 2) these conceptual boundaries expand multidimensionally: inwardly, outwardly, and temporally; 3) ST c an occur in the context of a significant life event and not just as a healthy characteristic of advanced age only; and 4) ST is positively related to mental health as an indicator of overall well -being in persons confronted with end -of-life issues. Reed's theory specifically proposes ST is greater in persons facing end -of-own life issues than in individuals not confronted with such issues and ST is positively related to indicators of well-being in persons facing end -of-own life issues. Based on these identi fied assumptions, Reed (1991b) proposes there is a relationship between the fluctuations of conceptual boundaries and well -being over the life span. Life events that increase the person's awareness of the end of life, such as a 10 terminal or chronic illness like that of chronic liver failure and liver transplantation, are conceptualized as a context of development during which an expanded self -boundary may occur resulting in greater ST. According to Reed, expansion of these self -boundaries is positively rela ted to indicators of well -being. Coward (1990a; 1990b, 1991, 1995, 1996; Coward & Lewis, 1993) empirically supports Reed's theory through findings suggesting ST is related to emotional well -being in numerous populations including healthy subjects, women w ith breast cancer, and in women and men with AIDS. Reed (1991b) also proposes expansion of the individual's conceptual boundaries through intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal experiences is developmentally appropriate regardless of chronologica l age in individuals confronted with end -of-own-life issues. Intrapersonal aspects of transcendence are those which are directed at self. Reed (1992) suggests intrapersonal transcendence encompasses connectedness within oneself. This intrapersonal transce ndence seems to be reflected in Kinney's (1996) report of her experiences of transcendence during diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. She talked of her breast cancer as an opportunity for healing and a catalyst for developing a better understanding o f her \"Self\" and her sense of purpose. Interpersonal aspects of transcendence address one's relationship with others and the natural environment (Reed, 1992). Joffrion and Douglas (1994) note self -transcendent persons often desire to share their experience s and insights with others because this sharing leads to a sense of connectedness with God, nature, and others. Long (1999) 11 suggests transcendence is reflected in our social relationships because interaction with others gives meaning to our being and provi des us with our greatest potential. Transpersonal aspects of transcendence are those characteristics that address the temporal. Reed (1992) suggests transpersonal transcendence involves a sense of relatedness to the unseen, God, or a power greater than s elf and ordinary resources. Thomas (1993b) found many transplant recipients feel their second chance at life is a gift from God or a higher power. Quality of life Ferrans and Powers' (1992) view QOL as a multidimensional construct that is highly subjective . Quality of life is defined within their conceptualization as a person's sense of well -being that stems from satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the areas of life that are important to him or her. Emphasis is placed on a person's subjective value of life events that impact QOL, suggesting a dynamic phenomenon that may change over time and be perceived differently by each individual. Within this framework, the person's judgment and evaluation of life conditions determines QOL (Ferrans, 1994). Ferrans and Powers (1992) have identified four domains important in QOL: health and functioning, socioeconomic, psychological/spiritual, and family. In their conceptualization, the health and functioning dimension includes such aspects of QOL as physical independence , ability to meet family responsibilities, sex life, usefulness to others, and potential for a happy old age. Social and economic aspects of QOL include factors such as friendships, standard of living, financial independence, physical living arrangements, and level of education. The psychological/spiritual dimension of QOL 12 encompasses satisfaction with life, general happiness, satisfaction with self, achievement of personal goals, peace of mind, personal appearance, and personal faith. The family dimension includes family happiness, children, relationships with significant other, and family health. These dimensions are consistent with findings found to be important in the liver transplant recipient's post -transplant experience (Commander et al., 1992; Mazari egos, Molmenti, & Kramer, 1999; Paris et al., 1997; Thomas 1993b). Research questions The following research questions were addressed: Among liver transplant recipients: 1) What is the difference in ST scores among the time -since-transplant cohorts a) relative to gender? b) controlling for the effect of age? 2) What is the difference in QOL scores among the time -since-transplant cohorts a) relative to gender? b) controlling for the effect of age? 3) What is the relationship among Quality of Life Index ( QLI), Self - Transcendence Scale (STS), Illness distress Scale (IDS), and Fatigue Scale (FS) scores within the total sample and time -since-transplant cohorts? 4) What is the difference in the relationships among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores within the time -since-transplant cohorts? 5) What are the significant predictors for QLI scores accounted for by STS scores, IDS scores, FS scores, gender, age, and time -since-transplant? 6) What factors and experiences do participants identify as affecting their ST and QOL during the transplant survivor experience? 13 Definitions The following theoretical and operational definitions were used in the study: Liver transplant : A surgical procedure in which a diseased liver is removed and replaced with a donor liver (Smith & C iferni, 1990). Self-transcendence: A dynamic process reflecting spiritual growth and maturity in which the individual is able to broaden his or her personal perspective beyond physical, psychological, and social boundaries to validate meaning and purpose f or challenging life experiences. Self -transcendence will be measured in this study using Reed's (1986) Self - Transcendence Scale (STS). Quality of life : A person's sense of well -being that stems from satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the areas of life th at are important to him or her (Ferrans & Powers, 1992). QOL will be measured in this study using the Quality of Life Index, Liver Transplantation Version (QLI -LT) (Ferrans & Powers, 1985). Illness distress : physical, psychological, social, or spiritual sy mptoms that are disruptive to an individual within the context of alteration in health. Illness distress will be measured in this study using the Illness Distress Scale (IDS) (Noyes et al., 1990). Level of fatigue : decreased capacity for physical or mental activity and effort due to a lack of resources (Aaronson et al., 1999). In this study, level of fatigue will be measured using a modified version (FS) of the Lee Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue (VAS -F) (Lee, Hicks, & Nino -Murcia, 1991). Assumptions The r esearcher assumed for this study: 14 1) The variables of interest could be measured quantitatively. 2) Participants were able to identify a personal awareness of ST and QOL. 3) The instruments used to measure the variables of interest were valid and reliable. 4) Partic ipants could accurately comprehend and complete the instruments used to measure the phenomena of interest. 5) Subjects will be honest and accurate in reporting their experiences when completing the study instruments. 6) Cross -sectional data from cohorts grouped according to time since transplantation would provide some indication of change in the variables under study as reflected longitudinally. Limitations Limitations of the study include: 1) The use of a convenience sample from one regional area in the Southwest United States may prohibit generalization of the findings to patient populations from other regional transplant centers. 2) The use of a cross -sectional sample of cohorts to infer changes in the level of ST and QOL across time may not accurately reflect these changes occurring in the same group of individuals over time. 3) Unequal numbers of subjects within the desired designated cohort groups may compromise the statistical comparisons between groups. 15 4) The researcher did not control for all potential extraneous va riables such as post-transplant complication rates, survivorship, individual medication regimes, level of social support, and spiritual perspective that might influence ST and QOL. Summary Quality of life as an outcome of liver transplantation has been re ported for many transplant recipients. Self -transcendence is a dynamic process that has been shown to contribute to QOL in non -transplant populations. Empirical data are needed, however, to evaluate the association between ST and QOL in the liver transpla nt population. A synthesis of Reed's (1991b) theory of ST and Ferrans and Powers' (1985) conceptualization of QOL was proposed as a useful conceptual framework for investigation the relationship of ST and QOL in liver transplant recipients. A greater under standing of these dynamic processes and potential influencing factors can lead to identification of nursing interventions useful for enhancing the development of ST an QOL in this patient population. 16 CHAPTER TWO REVIEW OF LITERATURE The review of literat ure addresses the three main concepts for this study: liver transplantation, self -transcendence (ST), and quality of life (QOL). The first section of the literature review includes an overview of liver transplantation including the physiologic, psychologic , social, and spiritual impact of liver transplantation on the individual during the pre - and post -transplant period. Specific discussion related to illness distress will be highlighted in this section. The second section of the literature review addresse s the current literature on ST including definitions and characteristics, antecedents, barriers, and outcomes, theoretical perspectives, research findings, and measurement issues. A focused look at the relationship between fatigue and ST as suggested in th e ST literature will be discussed in this section. The final section of the literature review discusses QOL including definitions and characteristics of QOL, theoretical perspectives of QOL including emphasis on the spiritual domain, empiric QOL data spec ific to the liver transplant experience, and measurement issues. Liver transplantation Liver transplantation involves the surgical implantation of a normal liver to replace an unhealthy liver. Liver transplantation is initiated only when the patient has irreversible end -stage liver disease that is refractory to other forms of conventional therapy. Examples of indications for liver transplant include advanced chronic liver 17 disease, fulminant hepatic failure, and metabolic liver disease (Van Thiel, Makowka, & Starzl, 1988). Absolute contraindications to liver transplantation include cholangiocarcinoma or active hepatitis (Smith & Ciferni, 1990), HIV positivity, septicemia, and severe cardiopulmonary or systemic disease (Everson & Kam, 1997). The first success ful human liver transplantation was performed by Dr. T.E. Starzl in 1967 (Starzl et al., 1968). The surgical procedure offers two approaches: orthotopic and heterotopic. Orthotopic transplantation, the most common approach, involves removal and replacement of the individual's diseased liver with a normal donor liver. In heterotopic liver transplantation, the individual's diseased liver is left in place and the donor liver is grafted into an ectopic site (Smith & Ciferni, 1990). According to the United Netw ork for Organ Sharing (UNOS) scientific registry, there are 117 liver transplant centers in the United States with over 27,700 liver transplants performed during the past decade. Five -year survival rates are 72.3% with a standard error of 0.4 (UNOS, 1997a) . Prior to the 1970's development of cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant, survival rates were less than 20% (Iwatsuki et al.,1988). Other factors contributing to increased survival rates include advances in surgical techniques, advances in medical -surgical technology, improved procurement and preservation techniques for the donor liver, and increased knowledge regarding management of complications (Smith & Ciferni, 1990). For the 26,000 people who die yearly of chronic liver disease (ALF, 2000), transplantation is the only treatment of choice for long term survival (Thomas, 1996). Liver disease often impacts multiple body systems including the muscular, 18 cardiovascular, and central nervous systems (Jonsson, Overend, & Kramer, 1998). In addition, psycho logical, social, and spiritual aspects of life are impacted as well. Individuals suffering from chronic liver disease often exhibit anxiety and depression (Beidel, 1987); a sense of guilt, loss of control, decreased self -esteem, and sense of isolation (Lan ge, 1992; Riether, 1990; Thomas, 1993b); and the need to identify a purpose and meaning for their lives (Thomas). Physiologic impact of liver transplantation Pre-transplant status Numerous physiologic changes and challenges are associated with liver transplantation. Hepatic encephalopathy is present in a large majority of pre -transplant patients (Surman, 1994). Body fat distribution and muscle mass are altered due to long - term prednisone administration and bone loss is intensified (Keown & Shackleton, 199 2). Transplant candidates often exhibit jaundice, portal hypertension, pruritus, renal insufficiency, variceal bleeding, ascites, osteodystrophy, and malnutrition due to the effects of chronic liver failure (Conn & Atterbury, 1993; Crippin, Ciferni, 1990). In a grounded theory study, Wainwright (1997) interviewed eight informants retrospectively regarding their pre -transplant experiences. Physical symptoms of chronic liver disease experienced b y this group prior to their liver transplants included nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, intolerance of fatty foods, heartburn, dulling of the senses, itchiness, swollen legs, forgetfulness, jaundice, hematemesis, and dramatic weight loss. Fatigue was frequently mentioned and described as feeling lifeless or totally exhausted. One 19 informant stated the days got shorter and shorter as the liver disease progressed and the fatigue became overwhelming. For some informants, the physical decline became so great, they ca me to see themselves as disabled. Post-transplant status Common physiologic challenges faced by the post -transplant patient include the threat of organ rejection (Bass, Bindon -Perler, & Lewis, 1991; Hutchinson, 1992; Paul & Solez, 1992), infection (Bass e t al.; Thomas, 1993a; Wagener & Yu, 1992), neurotoxicity from immunosuppressants (Strouse et al., 1998), acute renal failure (Bass et al.; Reich et.al., 1998), arterial hypertension (Reich et al.; Schwartz et al., 1996), development of diabetes mellitus (G entile, Turco, & Torella, 1998), bodily pain (Forsberg, Lorenzon, Nilsson, & B\u00e4ckmana, 1999), and weight change and obesity (Everhart et al., 1998; Reich et al.; Thomas, 1993b). Early complications that can occur after liver transplantation include extrah epatic complications such as pulmonary, neurologic, and renal dysfunction; bacterial, fungal, and viral infection; allograft -related complications (graft failure or rejection); surgical complications such as hepatic artery stenosis or thrombosis, portal ca val ampullary dysfunction), and gastrointestinal complications including post-operative bleeding or intestinal perforation (Everson & Kam, 1997; Mazariegos et al., 1999). Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral pathogen occurring most often after the first post -transplant month (Everson & Kam, 1997; Surman, 1994). CMV increases 20 the risk of rejection and can also result in a fatal pneumo nia (Surman). According to Everson & Kam, there is near universal exposure to CMV in all adults. Use of high -dose immunosuppression after transplantation causes reactivation of CMV in transplanted adults and can pose a fatal threat to the patient if not tr eated. Fungal infections are also common following transplantation (Everson & Kam). Additional physiologic complaints by liver transplant recipients highlighted in a study by Commander, Neuberger, and Dean (1992) include lack of energy, loss of confidence , and persistent physical symptoms as common post -transplant complaints. Subjects reported their recuperation had been gradual, with many only beginning to feel better after a minimum of six months recovery. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus is another com mon outcome of liver transplantation occurring in up to 46% of transplant recipients with more than 50% of the cases diagnosed within the first month after transplantation (Keown & Shackleton, 1992). This complication has a significant impact on long -term outcomes, reducing patient and graft survival rates, particularly due to the increased infections association with diabetes mellitus (Keown & Shackleton; Reich et al., 1998). Bacterial infections are, in fact, a frequent and serious complication of liver transplantation. Most occur during the first 30 days following liver transplantation. The most common sites are the abdomen, bloodstream, lower respiratory tract and the surgical wound. The proportion of patients developing at least one bacterial infection ranges from 25% to 50% and mortality associated with bacterial infections has been 4 % to 9% (Arnow, 1995). 21 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is another potential complication closely linked with the post-transplant experience. This infection has the potential to c ontribute to liver -related morbidity and mortality during the posttransplant period. Transplantation is recognized as a risk factor for acquiring HCV infection through the donor organ or transfused blood products. The risk of acquired infection has been re ported to range between 0 -35%. In patients who are viremic pretransplant, recurrent HCV infection is nearly universal. Fortunately, progression to cirrhosis is uncommon (Terrault, Wright, & Pereira, 1995). Organ rejection is an ongoing threat for the live r transplant recipient. Because the transplanted liver is recognized by the recipient's immune system as foreign, rejection is the body's normal physiologic response. Immunosuppressive medications are important in the treatment and prevention of rejection, though severe side effects are often associated with treatment (Chappell, 1999). For instance, malignancies after organ transplantation have been documented as a result of the immunosuppression treatment to prevent organ rejection (Hanto, Shelton, & Simmo ns, 1992; Sheil, 1992) and the incidence increases with the length of time on immunosuppression therapy. Nonmelanotic skin and lip cancers are the most common tumors in transplant recipients (Hanto et al.). Skin changes other than malignancy are also asso ciated with immunosuppressant therapy. Patients treated with azathioprine and corticosteroids over a period of years often have atrophic, friable skin that is dry and scaly. Wounds often become infected and are slow to heal. Acne can occurs during periods of high -dose steroid therapy. There can also be increased hair growth on the arms, back, or face (Sheil, 1992). 22 Use of cyclosporine, a common immunosuppressant, causes excess hair growth which can negatively affect body image, particularly for women. Gin gival hyperplasia occurs in approximately 10% of patients treated with cyclosporine (Sheil, 1992). Sixty - eight percent to 92% of patients receiving cyclosporine also develop hypertension compared to 5 -75% treated with azathioprine (Keown & Shackleton, 1992 ). According to Keown and Shackleton, post -transplant hypertension occurring in cyclosporine patients is frequently severe and resistant to therapy, requiring reduction of immunosuppressants to the lowest dose possible. Chronic nephrotoxicity is also known to occur with cyclosporine use, particularly with long -term administration. Everson and Kam (1997) noted many immunosuppressant side effects for cyclosporine and tacrolimus reported in recent international, multicenter liver transplantation trials (US Mul ticenter, 1994; European Multicentre, 1994). These side effects include fever, anorexia, nausea, hyperkalemia, hypertension, renal dysfunction, headache, paresthesia, tremor, diarrhea, vomiting, hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus, alopecia, hirsutism, and ra sh. Corticosteroid use may be associated with psychological insults such as sleep disturbance, increased appetite, irritability, labile mood, and perceptual abnormalities. Neurologic side effects include tremor, seizure, coma, cortical blindness, quadriple gia, and delirium (Surman, 1994). Osteoporosis is also associated with the prolonged use of corticosteroids and has resulted in severe bone loss and fracture in liver transplant recipients (Epstein, Shane, & Bilezikian, 1995). 23 Psychologic impact of liver transplantation Pre-transplant status Behavioral, psychiatric, and emotional disturbances are common for patients with advanced liver disease, many of whom exhibit hepatic encephalopathy (Tarter et al., 1984). Increased dependency on others, loss of empl oyment, envy of healthy people, marital and sexual problems, and loss of income are common stressors associated with chronic liver disease (House, Dubovsky, & Penn, 1983). Wainwright (1997) reported patients with chronic liver disease described an overwhel ming desire to regain their lost independence and to live a normal life again. Death is an imminent reality for the patient with end stage liver disease since transplantation is the only life -sustaining treatment currently available. The individual's realization of their mortality often produces symptoms of anxiety, depression, regression, and lack of cooperation (Beidel, 1987; House et al., 1983; House & Thompson, 1988; Penn, Bunch, Olenik, & Abouna, 1971; Porter et Surman, 1994). Surman notes \"adjustment disorder\" is a frequent finding among liver transplant candidates that varies according to individual personality, chronicity, and morbidity. Anger and denial may be present, particularly in those patients who w ere recently referred for transplant. Thomas (1993b) noted informants in her phenomenological study who perceived they were dying exhibited a sense of desperation. As physical health deteriorates, anxiety often progressively increases (Porter et al., 1991 ). Pre -transplant patients also exhibit anxiety related to the uncertainty of being 24 accepted into a transplant program, finding a donor organ in time, and successfully surviving the transplant surgery (Lange, 1992; Riether, 1990). Stilley et al. (1997) me asured depression and anxiety in 26 liver transplant candidates. Fifteen patients had a positive history of substance abuse, but were not currently using. Eighty percent of subjects manifested symptomatic depression on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Seventy -five percent of the subjects scored higher than published norms on the State -Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Patients with a history of substance abuse identified more anxiety and depression than non -abusing patients. Findings support previous rep orts of increased psychological distress for liver transplant candidates, regardless of substance abuse history. House and Thompson (1988) found negative psychological post -operative outcomes are often related to a long waiting period prior to transplantat ion. Anxiety, irritability, hopelessness, and depression may result during this wait. In addition, the authors noted these patients often think about how their need for a suitable organ means someone will have to die. These thoughts often result in feeling s of guilt (House & Thompson). Others have also documented this conflict (Lange, 1992; Porter 1993a). Post-transplant status Psychological symptoms following transplantation are believed to have a powerfu l effect on post hospital adjustment and recipient survival (Beidel, 1987). Beidel notes anxiety and depression are common features in all types of transplant recipients both pre - and postoperatively. Beidel cautions the pre -procedure psychological conditi on 25 of hepatic patients has not been documented in the studies assessing levels of anxiety and depression, making it difficult to assess the impact of the pre -procedure transplant status on post -procedure conditions. Riether (1990) also notes depression is difficult to assess both pre - and post -operatively for transplant patients since many of the symptoms of depression can also be linked to physical factors commonly experienced with chronic liver disease and transplant recovery. Tarter et al. (1984) found a profile of moderate anxiety, somatic distress and concern, frustration, depression, worry, and social withdrawal in their study of liver transplant recipients who were an average of three years post -transplant. Organic brain syndrome (OBS), depression, an d anxiety were reported by Surman, Dienstag, Cosimi, Chauncey, and Russell (1987) to be the main psychiatric problems encountered in their investigation of liver transplant recipients. Factors they identified contributing to postoperative OBS include infec tion, sleep deprivation, and metabolic impairment. Depression in this group of 40 transplant recipients (demographics not reported) was associated with early rejection or infection. Anxiety was also reported to be common when medical setbacks occurred and as hospital discharge approached. In contrast, Riether, Smith, Lewison, Cotsonis, and Epstein (1992) found improved depression scores and stable anxiety scores in liver transplant recipients over the first year following transplant. The researchers compar ed 51 heart and 61 liver transplant candidates and recipients for depression and anxiety over a 12 month period. The researchers note there was significant loss of subjects completing the study due to death, transfer of follow -up care to another center, or decline in medical status resulting 26 in significant study limitations. Scores for the liver transplant candidate prior to transplantation included a mean score of 13.4 (SD 7.4) on the Beck depression inventory (BDI) which indicates minimal or no depression . Liver transplant candidates indicated a mean \"state\" score of 41.9 (SD 12.9) (<1 SD above norm) on the Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (norm < 34.9) and a mean \"trait\" score of 39.2 (SD 12.2) (<1 SD above norm, norm < 34.9). There were n o significant differences between the heart and liver transplant candidate scores for any of these three measures. At six months, the liver transplant recipients (n = 19) BDI mean score had improved significantly from the pre-transplantation score (M = 7.8 , SD 6.8) [F = 5.4 (2,36), p < .009], though STAI scores were stable. Heart transplant recipients BDI scores did not differ significantly from the liver transplant recipients, though the heart recipients showed greater and quicker improvement in depressio n scores. STAI scores between the two transplant groups were not significantly different and both groups scored at the reported standardized mean for general medical or surgical patients without psychiatric diagnosis. Scores for all measures at 12 months i ndicated no significant difference between groups or from initial scores. In contrast to the findings reported by Stilley et al. (1997), Riether and associates (1992) did not find elevated depression scores in the pre -transplant candidate and anxiety scores were mildly elevated from norms (< 1 SD). This disparity in findings could be explained by demographic or comorbidity differences between study subjects. Clearly, further investigation is warranted. 27 Results from the Riether et al. study (1992) suggest anxiety was not significantly increased during the post -transplant experience from initial pre -transplant scores nor from mean scores reported by other nonpsychiatric medical and surgical patients. The researchers suggest these findings indicate subjects s uccessfully adapted to their chronic illness state during the first year following transplantation. Social and vocational adjustments were hypothesized to contribute to a slight increase in anxiety scores from the 3-month to 12 -month measurement period, th ough this increase was not statistically significant. Depression scores were significantly improved at 6 months for the liver transplant recipients. Improvement could be directly due to resolution of depressive symptoms or secondary to resolution of organ failure. The confounding effects of corticosteroid treatment post -operatively makes further interpretation of the depression scores difficult. Riether (1990) has suggested anxiety and depression for liver transplant recipients can be due to financial worri es, the possibility of organ rejection, or unresolved grief reaction to the loss of their diseased organ. Difficulty in adjusting to a less dependent role, such as the sick role associated with the pre -transplant state, can also contribute to feelings of a nxiety and depression in this patient population. Assimilation of the transplanted organ can also be a psychological challenge for recipients of transplanted organs (Beidel, 1987). Dubovsky, Metzner, and Warner (1979) reported a case study of a 38 -year-old alcoholic male who initially saw his transplanted liver as a \"foreign body\" and eventually referred to the organ as his \"new wife.\" Because the organ came from a female, the patient also struggled with feelings he was now \"part 28 woman.\" Body image is cert ainly a psychological for organ transplant recipients (Lange, 1992; Riether, 1990; Surman, 1994), particularly if the recipient views the new organ as a foreign body (House & Thompson, 1988). House, Dubovsky, and Penn (1983) reported 2 of 38 liver t ransplant recipients expressed concerns about the origin of their transplanted organ. One patient was concerned the donor had a different racial background and a second was concerned that the donor's age was the same as her own child. Riether (1990) cited similar instances. In one case, a white male patient was terrified the he had received an \"unchristian heart;\" another was angry at the possibility he had received a heart from a man of a different ethnic background. Still another patient who had received the heart of a 19 -year-old expected to be able to quickly resume mountain climbing and marathon running and believed he would no longer be impotent. Positive post -operative outcomes have been related to a healthy psyche. Based on an extensive review of li terature related to psychiatric aspects of organ transplantation, House and Thompson (1988) noted patients who are highly motivated (e.g., wanting to see a child graduate or marry), who are somewhat obsessive -compulsive, and who exhibit hope and a supporti ve system of beliefs, often have more positive post -operative outcomes than those who do not. House and Thompson (1988) noted patients can become increasingly fearful as a result of hearing about adverse side effects associated with post -operative transp lant treatment or when hearing about the deaths of other transplant patients. The authors found during the post -transplant period, patients and families often have an interest in the 29 donor and may have emotions associated with the donor's cause of death, a ge, sex, or race. Survivor guilt is also common, particularly if an individual receives the transplant before another patient who is sicker or has waited longer than the recipient (Riether, 1990). Discharge from the hospital after transplantation is seen by some patients to be the most difficult time of their transplant experience (Commander et al., 1992; Lange, 1992). Concern about appropriate levels of activity, isolation, employment issues, and even conflicting medical information are sources of stress. Social impact of liver transplantation Pre-transplant status Concern regarding the financial burden of a transplant on the individual's family is a common issue verbalized by transplant candidates 1990; Th omas, 1993b). Relocation close to the transplant center can result not only in financial burden, but also in social isolation as the transplant recipient may be away from family and friends indefinitely (Lange). Transplant candidates have also identified o ther sociological difficulties related to transplantation including guilt about burdening their families, fear of death, loss of control over their life and future, loss of self -esteem, changes in body image, sexual dysfunction, marital conflicts, and a se nse of isolation (Lange, 1992; Riether, 1990; Thomas, 1993b). Liver transplantation is also often associated with a social stigma because many people incorrectly assume the patient with liver disease is an alcoholic or drug addict (Riether; Wainwright, 19 97). 30 Post-transplant status Paris and associates (1997) reviewed current literature related to employment issues for the post -transplant recipient. These authors noted transplant programs often support post -transplant medical disability for transplant rec ipients instead of encouraging these patients to return to work. This practice is based on patient reports regarding multiple employment barriers encountered when the transplant recipient returns to work. These barriers include hiring discrimination based on medical history, restrictive cost or unavailability of medical insurance or workmen's compensation, poor local economic conditions, and limited education or work skills. Changes in patient and family values since transplantation also affected employmen t status. For instance, family and leisure activities may now be valued more than time spent at work. Thomas (1993b) found informants in her study (n = 13) were afraid they would not be able to function at the pace required if they returned to work post-transplant or they might loose disability benefits if they were not able to maintain the required work schedule. Finding a job or changing jobs was a concern because many insurance companies will not cover pre -existing conditions. Other informants perceived employers would be reluctant to hire transplant recipients. Those who did return to work felt they were \"making the most of the gift of life\" (p. 192) and felt like productive members of society. Social factors associated with the decision to return to w ork post -transplant include the assurance of continued health insurance, a willingness to give up disability income, age (<55 years), educational level (>12 years), and pre -transplant disability of 31 less than four years (Paris et al., 1997). The researchers noted it was very important the transplant recipient believe they were physically able to work since patient perception of physical disability is directly linked to post -transplant employment status. The psychological insults of depression, fear, or anxie ty, so common in pre -transplant recipients, can also negatively impact the patient's ability to function post -transplant in a vocational environment. These researchers also noted weakness and fatigue due to inactivity and deconditioning influenced post -transplant employment status (Paris et al., 1997). Post - transplant medication side effects also can limit employment due to effects on cognitive functioning and changes in body image affecting the individual's self -esteem. Fear of infection or rejection also prevents some recipients from seeking employment. Another study addressing employment and adjustment to illness in 108 orthotopic liver transplant recipients was conducted by Tart (1989). Time since transplant for these subjects ranged from 2 months to 4. 75 years with a mean of 1 year. Forty -nine percent were less than one year (n = 53) out from transplant and 50.9% (n = 55) were more than one year post -surgery. A majority of the subjects (58.3%) were female and nearly 60% had greater than a high school education (31.5% were college graduates). Seventy -eight percent of the subjects were either working or able to work but retired. Tart found those recipients who were at least six months post -transplant and working scored higher on the Psychosocial Adjustme nt to Illness Scale (PAIS) than those recipients who were not working. The researcher suggests work is vital to a person's self -concept, sense of productivity, and accomplishment and often reflects the individual's perception of worth 32 and contribution to s ociety. Those transplant recipients who are employed may have a more positive self -concept than those not employed because of their ability to work and may, therefore, adapt more readily to the chronicity associated with transplantation. In a study of 10 liver transplant recipients (mean age = 27.8 years, SD = 11.23) and 10 Crohn's patients (mean age = 39.30, SD = 11.82), Tarter and associates (1984) found the transplant recipients did not differ significantly from the Crohn's (control) group on measures o f psychiatric status and social functioning. Time since surgery for the transplant recipients was a mean of 36.3 months (SD = 42.19) and time since diagnosis to transplantation averaged 45.2 months (SD = 73.02). The duration of illness for the Crohns' pati ents from time of original diagnosis until data collections averaged 63.56 months (SD = 73.02). When compared to normative population values, the transplant patients did identify negative effects of transplantation on sleep and rest, eating and appetite, work capacity, and recreation and pastimes. Impairments were noted to be > 20% on each scale compared to expected norms of near 0%. Commander, Neuberger, and Dean (1992) studied 32 adult liver transplant recipients (14 men, 18 women; 56.3% ranged from 45 -64 years of age) for prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and level of social adjustment. The researchers found the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the study sample did not differ from that found in the general population. While the sample's overall adjustment of social functioning also did not differ from the general population, work, marriage, and extended family role areas were affected significantly (p < .01) in the liver transplant recipients though the researchers gave no examples or explanations for these findings. The researchers did note 33 differences in overall social adjustment were not associated with age, gender, marital status, underlying pathology, liver function, other medical problems, or length of time since transplantation. Spiritual im pact of liver transplantation There has been little attention to the spiritual impact of liver transplantation, though the importance of spirituality in terminal illness has been documented (Coward, 1990a, 1991, 1994; Hall, 1997; Herth, 1990; Landis, 1996; Miller, 1985). Thomas (1993b) found liver transplant recipients (n = 13) searched for meaning and purpose in their lives as a result of their transplant experience. Informants in her study felt their second chance at life was a gift from God or a higher p ower. A change in these informants' world view resulted from their transplant experience and affected how they ordered life's priorities and lived day to day. Lumby (1997) found liver transplant recipients (n = 8) described the meaning of their experience as a paradox of facing life and death at the same time. Hope was an important aspect of coping during the waiting period. Illness distress Because of the significant impact of liver disease and transplantation on patients' physical, psychological, social , and spiritual health, the level of illness distress associated with liver transplantation necessitates exploration. Illness distress is often described in the literature as an individual's negative response to illness and has most often been explored within the realm of symptom distress. Woodgate and McClement (1998) describe distress as mental or physical strain imposed by pain, trouble, worry, or other stressors 34 such as frequent hospitalization or intrusive procedures. These authors also note distress implies suffering. Rhodes and Watson (1987) define symptom distress as the degree or amount of physical or mental upset, anguish, or suffering experienced from a specific symptom. According to Knobf (2000), symptom distress occurs to some degree in all pa tients throughout the illness continuum. Tishelman, Degner, and Mueller (2000) suggest symptoms can be used to demonstrate the meaning illness has for an individual, which is more than just a reflection of disease process. Cimprich (1999) suggests symptoms are complex phenomena that reflect physical, mental or cognitive, or affective responses to illness and treatment. These responses may overlap or interact in a way that diminishes or worsens level of distress and adjustment. Cimprich offers examples of ho w symptom distress is related to illness distress. She suggests the emotional or affective distress associated with a life -threatening illness may increase the demands placed on cognitive resources, particularly attention, eventually leading to cognitive o r attentional fatigue. This fatigue often results in reduced effectiveness in daily functioning that in turn contributes to an overall increased level of illness distress. Coward (1991) defines illness distress as the tension resulting from interaction between a stimulus of illness and the person's perceived physiological and psychological synchrony. Coward studied the relationship between ST, emotional well -being, and illness distress in 107 women with advanced breast cancer. She found ST decreased illness distress in these women through the mediating effect of emotional well -being, conceptualized as a component of perceived QOL. Self -transcendence directly affected 35 emotional well -being (beta = 0.69) and emotional well -being had a strong negative effect on illness distress (beta = -0.84). The direct path from ST to illness distress was non - significant (beta = - 0.08) when statistically controlling for the effect of emotional well - being on illness distress. Coward notes there is a possibility women with less illness distress had more energy to expend on ST. This notion is of particular interest in the liver transplant population since fatigue is a frequent source of illness distress (Commander et al., 1992; Noyes et al., 1990; Paris et al., 1997; & Wainwright, 1997). Noyes et al. (1990) describes illness distress as physical and emotional distress related to serious illness. This definition is not particularly helpful since \"distress\" is not clearly defined, but does suggest there is a disruption in the normal status of the patient. The authors provide examples of distress such as discomfort, loss of meaning, physical disease, medical treatment, and social isolation, all examples of negative aspects of illness. Interestingly, the authors note loss of meaning as an example of emotional distress, instead of clearly delineating it as an example of spiritual distress even though spirituality is often associated with finding meaning and purpose in life. Social isolation is also classified as emotional distress by th ese authors instead of specified as social distress. Noyes and associates (1990) developed a tool, the Illness Distress Scale (IDS), to measure the illness distress phenomenon in 438 cancer patients. The scale contains 22 items ranked on a 5 -point scale ( range 0 -4). Subscales for the tool include loss of meaning, physical disease, medical treatment, and social isolation. Subscale scores for each individual were obtained by multiplying the score for each item by it's factor -36 loading. The researchers found th e physical manifestations of illness to be the greatest overall source of distress for this group of subjects, particularly for the group of inpatients. Outpatients (n = 386) had an average distress score of 0.69 for physical disease distress compared to a score of 1.27 for inpatients (n = 32). Loss of energy was the source of highest distress (score = 1.04 for outpatients and 1.38 for inpatients). This finding may have particular importance since fatigue has been suggested as a barrier to ST (Coward, 1991) . Other references to illness distress in the literature are most often related to discussions of \"symptom\" distress. Van Servellen et al. (1998) studied emotional distress in women with symptomatic HIV disease. Examples of emotional distress proposed by the author included feelings of fear and sadness, clinical depression, and anxiety. Vogl et al. (1999) describe symptom distress as an important but poorly characterized aspect of QOL. Examples of symptom distress identified by in 504 AIDS patients includ ed worry (86%), fatigue (85%), sadness (82%), and pain (76%). Both the number of symptoms and level of symptom distress were highly associated with poorer global QOL scores in these subjects. Hollenberg, Williams, and Anderson (2000) studied medical therap y, symptoms, and distress in 475 patients with angina pectoris. The researchers found significant associations between the degree of symptom distress and change in QOL. An unchanged, stable symptom distress was associated with a substantial improvement in QOL (0.1SD). Extreme changes in symptom distress (either improved or deteriorating) resulted in substantially larger changes in global QOL (0.1 to 0.2 SD). 37 Smucker (1996) conducted a hermeneutical phenomenological study of spiritual distress in five men an d five women from the general population. To participate in the study, informants had to have experienced being concerned about the meaning of life, death or beliefs; able and willing to articulate the experience; feel free enough to express inner feelings ; and be adult non -nurses. The term \"spiritual distress\" was not part of the interview question. Smucker (1996) found a spiritually distressful event was often one that occurred suddenly or unexpectedly, did not fit within the natural order of things or d id not make sense, and often was tragic and emotional. This description is consistent with the experience of life -threatening illness or trauma and suggests spiritual distress is an important aspect of nursing care. The definition of spiritual distress tha t emerged from the data is an uncomfortable experience of spiritual or existential struggle within which there is potential for growth. Smucker (1996) found spiritual distress can be an opportunity for growth and change. Initially, individuals experiencin g spiritual distress described feelings of falling apart, instability, or painful emotions. Some found comfort and support in a sense of \"something beyond\" self. Throughout this phase, informants expressed an intense wondering that was focused on making se nse out of the crisis. The second phase of spiritual distress involved initiation of coping skills such as reaching out to friends, family, and religious or spiritual beliefs. Initially, all energy was focused on survival in this phase, but as stability wa s achieved, informants began to make meaning of their experience. 38 Psychospiritual distress was also mentioned in the literature by Smith (1995). She suggests individuals may experience distress if they are unable to find a comforting death perspective or i f their spiritual conceptualization fails to meet the demands that confronting their mortality places on them. Smith poses that spiritual awareness and personal death perspective play an important part on impacting psychosocial distress for individuals con fronting death. Illness distress is defined in this study as physical, psychological, social, or spiritual symptoms that are disruptive to an individual within the context of an alteration in health. Because of the numerous alterations in health associated with liver disease and transplantation and the proposed association between illness distress, fatigue, and QOL for patients with chronic disease, illness distress appears to be an important area of investigation in understanding the relationship between S T and QOL in the liver transplant population. Summary of liver transplantation literature The experience of liver transplantation has many implications for the individual beyond that of merely extending life. Physiologic, psychologic, social, and spiritua l manifestations of illness distress require the transplant recipient to continuously adjust to the many chronic aspects of living with transplantation. These stressors have a profound affect upon the individual's perception of their QOL, a reflection of l ife satisfaction, following transplantation. While some attention has been given to the physical, psychological, and social aspects of liver transplantation, there is a paucity of research addressing the spiritual 39 aspects of this experience. Investigatio n of the spiritual dimension in liver transplant recipients will provide a more balanced perspective for the delivery of holistic care to this patient population. In an effort to facilitate more understanding of the spiritual dimension in the experience o f liver transplantation, the relationship between QOL and ST, a measure of the individual's spiritual maturity, will be explored in this study. Due to the prevalence of illness distress reported for the liver transplant population and its proposed relatio nship to ST and QOL, the relationship of illness distress to ST and QOL will also be explored. Self-transcendence Multi -disciplinary discussions have suggested ST is a crucial dimension of spirituality (Benner, 1989; 1992; Sipiora, 1994) important in fostering positive life outcomes such as well -being (Reed, 1986, 1989; Smith, 1995) and mental health (Reed, 1986, 1989, 1991a). For the purposes of this investigation, self - transcendence is defined as a dynamic process reflecting spiritual growth and maturity in which the individual is able to broaden his or her personal perspective for challenging life experiences beyond physical, psychological, and social boundaries to validate the meaning and purpose of these life experiences. A review of the available literature on this phenomenon, including theoretical discussions, research findings and measurement issues, will be described in this section of the literature review. 40 Definitions and descriptions of self -transcendence A review of literature across disciplines provides varied definitions and descriptions of ST. Table 1 (p. 41) provides a summary of these definitions and descriptions. Reed (1991a) i ntroduced the concept of ST in the nursing literature as a major developmental resource of aging. She defines ST as \"the expansion of one's conceptual boundaries inwardly through introspective activities, outwardly through concerns about others' welfare, and temporally by integrating perceptions of one's past and future to enhance the present\" (p. 5). An individual's conceptual boundary is best described as the individual's holistic perspective of self that goes beyond the physical or material world (Reed, 1996). Building on Reed's work, Coward explored the experience of ST in women with advanced breast cancer (1990a & b) and in persons with AIDS (Coward, 1994; Coward & Lewis, 1993). Based on these studies, Coward defines ST as the capacity to reach out beyond oneself, to extend oneself beyond personal concerns, and to take on broader life perspectives, activities, and purposes. Emblen and Halstead (1993) interviewed 19 surgical patients, 12 nurses, and 7 chaplains to identify spiritual needs and intervent ions important to patients. Transcendence was identified as a spiritual need by the informants and the definition which emerged from the interviews indicates transcendence \"refers to rising above or going beyond the limits of material existence, eg., beyon d earthly being, dimension other than physical/mental, contact with God\" (p. 178). 41 Table 1 Definitions of Self -transcendence Author Definition or description Benner (1989) A spiritual experience that pulls the individual out and beyond himself, not o nly to others, but to some Higher Being Conn (1987) Self-realization that moves beyond oneself to bring about the good of others Coward (1990a;1994) The capacity to reach out beyond oneself, to extend oneself beyond personal concerns, and to take on broa der life perspectives, activities, and purposes Decker (1993) The experience of existence beyond the physical and psychological; an inner realization that reorders the individual's personality during spiritual development (increase in the search for purpo se and meaning) resulting in feelings of greater harmony, altruism, resourcefulness, and integration Emblen & Halstead (1993) Rising above or going beyond the limits of material existence (eg., beyond earthly being, dimension other than physical/mental, contact with God) Fahlberg, Wolfer, & Fahlberg (1992) A process of moving beyond a sole identity with the self or self-concept (self -identity) by transcending that identity to experience a sense of unity with other human beings and the universe Flier (19 95) A different way of knowing Hanna, Giordano, Dupuy, & Puhakka (1995) Moving beyond contextual limitations Leslie (1985) The ability to reach beyond self to other people we love or to causes that are important to us Levington & Gruba - McCallister (1993 ) The living out of one's possibilities in a manner that promotes growth toward personal wholeness and integrity Noble (1987) A brief state of higher consciousness that has a powerful transforming effect upon the individual Peck (1968) Ability to accept one's own inevitable mortality Reed (1991a) Expansion of one's conceptual boundaries inwardly through introspective activities, outwardly through concerns about others' welfare, and temporally by integrating perceptions of one's past and future to enhance the present Tornstam (1996, 1997) A shift in metaperspective that results in a new definition of reality 42 Psychologists have also explored the concept of transcendence. Peck (1968) described transcendence as the ability to accept one's own inevitable mortality. In his study of 1000 businessmen, Peck found individuals who experience pleasure and life satisfaction as they age, tend to transcend both their selves and their bodies. Absence of transcendence led to dissatisfaction and fear of death. More rec ent discussion in the psychology literature also lends support to the perspective of transcendence as moving beyond boundaries. Decker (1993) refers to transcendence as \"the experience of existence beyond the physical and psychological\" (p. 34). Decker's t hesis is that transcendence is a necessary component of spirituality, the search for purpose and meaning. Hanna et al. (1995) define transcendence as moving beyond contextual limitations. Their phenomenological study of transcendence (n = 18) suggests the psychological change process associated with critical life events is both developmental and therapeutic and involves \"a sense of moving beyond or stepping outside of a set of perceived restrictions, confines, or limitations\" (p. 146). Coward's (1990a, 199 4) definition of transcendence is congruent with that of Levington and Gruba -McCallister (1993). These psychologists describe transcendence as \"the living out of one's possibilities in a manner that promotes growth toward personal wholeness and integrity\" (p. 75). They suggest transcendence is \"a significant element present in profound and potentially traumatic experiences in which dying temporarily overshadows living\" (p. 81). For individuals contemplating suicide, choosing death may seem to actually be a life-affirming decision because life as they currently experience it is so painful. Levington and Gruba -McCallister found in their phenomenological study of 43 suicide survivor's experience of transcendence that the survivors' ability to resolve \"the paradox of life and death\" through an enhanced appreciation of life served as a \"catalyst for ST\" (p. 75). As clinicians, the researchers suggest therapy for survivors of suicide should focus on helping the individual recognize \"life and death are inextricably intertwined in human experience\" and their close brush with death affords them \"an opportunity to commit themselves to life once again\" (p.76). The authors suggest individuals who successfully solve this paradox are more likely to experience ST rather than s elf-destruction. Self -transcendence according to these authors is reflected as a \"sense of self that is multidimensional, paradoxical, strong, and ultimately unified\" (p. 85). Decker (1993) cites the work of psychologists such as Jaffe (1985), Kohlberg (1981), Maslow (1971), Walsh (1989), and Wilber (1981), suggesting these authors describe transcendence as an inner realization that reorders the personality during spiritual development. Decker defines spiritual development as an increase in the search for purpose and meaning. He suggests the personality reorder that occurs as a result of the individual's ST produces feelings of greater harmony, altruism, resourcefulness, and integration in the individual. Other psychologists have offered discussions of tran scendence in the literature, but failed to offer a specific definition of the phenomenon. Flier (1995) discusses transcendence as mysticism, a different way of knowing. Chinen (1986) describes transcendence in terms of process and tasks important to succes sful experiences during the challenges of later life. Noble (1987) discusses transcendence in terms of a higher 44 state of consciousness that occurs briefly, but has a powerful transforming effect upon the individual. Sipiora (1994) also describes transcende nce in terms of a \"displaced spiritual dimension . . .being called beyond our functional selves to reflect on that which grants the place of mortal dwelling\" (p. 335). Melding together influences from both theology and psychology, Benner (1989) emphasizes humans are psychospiritual beings. He states humans have a yearning for ST, representing man's quest to have a relationship with God. From Benner's perspective, ST is at the heart of the spiritual experience and is described as something that pulls the individual out and beyond himself, not only to others, but to some Higher Being. This conceptualization of a transcendent triad involving self, others, and a Higher Power is consistent with Reed's (1991a) theory of transcendence. Influenced by Frankl's (1959) work in logotherapy, theologian Robert Leslie (1985) describes ST as \"our ability to reach beyond ourselves to other people we love or to causes that are important to us\" (p. 25). Self -transcendence as self -realization that moves beyond oneself to bring a bout the good of others is a perspective offered by another theologian, Walter Conn (1987). Both perspectives are consistent with Coward's (1990a, 1994) empirical description of ST emphasizing the importance of connecting beyond self with others and events or actions that give life purpose and meaning. Wainwright's (1995) findings from interviews with liver transplant recipients also suggest connecting with others who have had similar experiences provides a means for transcending the transplant experience. 45 A simultaneous concept analysis of spiritual perspective, hope, acceptance, and ST by Haase et al. (1992) identified three critical attributes of ST: 1) reaching out beyond self-concern; 2) stepping back from and moving beyond what is, and 3) extending sel f- boundaries inwardly, outwardly, and temporally. Additionally, five antecedents of ST were described. The first, an inherent tendency of humans to move beyond their own self interest, is essential according to the authors. The remaining four antecedent s were identified by the researchers as potential, rather than essential, and include spiritual perspective, a pivotal life event or stressful stimuli, human work that enlarges the goals and vision of the person, and acceptance of an inescapable situation. Outcomes of ST identified in the literature by the researchers include a sense of well -being; enhanced feelings of self -worth; a greater sense of connectedness with others, nature, and God; personal growth; finding purpose and meaning in life; and a sens e of being healed (Haase et al.). Gerontologic sociologist Lars Tornstam (1996, 1997) has developed a concept of gerotranscendence, which he proposes to be a late stage in the developmental process of aging. Gerotranscendence is described as \"a shift in metaperspective\" (p. 38) involving the individual's experience of \"a shift of time, space, life and death, and the self\" (p. 38). Like Benner (1989) and McKenzie (1991), Tornstam describes an \"intrinsic drive toward transcendence\" (p. 41). Also consistent with other authors (Coward, 1990a; Fahlberg et al., 1992; Smith, 1995), Tornstam suggests a life crisis often precedes the experiences of transcendence. According to Tornstam, the outcome of gerotranscendence is a new perspective, a new definition of real ity. 46 Tornstam (1996) suggests there are several types of transcendence such as time and space where the transcendence of the borders between past and present occurs, or life and death when a new comprehension of life and death emerges. Body transcendence, role transcendence, transcendence of values (right and wrong as absolutes), and social transcendence are other examples he proposes. Self -transcendence is specifically described by Tornstam as only one type of transcendence. In Tornstam's explanation of ST, the individual shifts from egoism to altruism. This conceptualization is consistent with descriptions by Coward (1990a, 1994), Benner (1989), Leslie (1985), Conn (1987), and Fahlberg et al. (1992) and supports findings by Wainwright (1995). Philosopher E ugene Long (1998) suggests ST is a human experience where the individual is faced with the limits of what can be accounted for within ordinary terms that points beyond these limits to a wider range of being. While humans share commonalties of temporal expe riences with other humans, Long observes we also seem able to transcend or go beyond these common boundaries. As beings of potentiality or beings \"on the way\" to becoming, Long suggests we are always transcending boundaries, moving into new possibilities o f being. As humans, we manifest a desire to go beyond explanations offered within ordinary empirical reality in order to explain the \"totality\" of life. Characteristics of self -transcendence General characteristics for transcendence noted in the literature are numerous. Transcendence is seen as a developmental process (Chinen, 1986; 1995; Tornstam, 1996, 1997) that is recognized 47 particularly as a task associated with end -of-life (Chinen, 1986; Reed, 1 991a; Tornstam, 1996). Self -transcendence is an intrinsic aspect of nature (Benner, 1987; Frankl, 1969; Reed, 1991b; Smith, 1995; Tornstam, 1996) which Reed (1996) describes as an innate, inner potential related to health and healing. Transcendence is also noted by several authors to be an instinctively human desire or disposition (Benner, 1989; McKenzie, 1991) that involves effort (Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Hanna et al., 1995). Transcendence is individualized according to one's perso nal context such as culture, faith, or personality (Chinen, 1986; Tornstam, 1996) and occurs as an effective response drive of the human spirit for meaning, truth, value, love (Conn, 1987). It is a resource for or characteristic of mental health (Young & R eed, 1995). Antecedents of self -transcendence Suggested antecedents of transcendence include life crises (Coward, 1990a; Fahlberg et al., 1992; Reed, 1996; Smith, 1995; Tornstam, 1994, 1996) or life experiences that foster developmental change (Haase et al ., 1992). Suffering (Long, 1998; Steeves & Kahn, 1987), spiritual emergency (Fahlberg et al., 1992), turmoil or confusion of thought or affect (Hanna et al., 1995), facing the paradox of life & death (Levington & Gruba -McCallister, 1993), direct challenge (Flier, 1995; Hanna et al.), and spiritual longing (Benner, 1989) are all examples of life crises or experiences that can facilitate transcendence. Chinen (1986) proposes disengagement from the situation is necessary for transcendence to occur. Spiritual p erspective, work, acceptance (Haase et al.), a sense of urgency, a spontaneous or sudden insight (Hanna et al.), and reminiscing 48 about previous transcendent experiences (Coward, 1990a) are also suggested antecedents for transcendence. Haase et al. (1992) distinguish between essential and potential antecedents of transcendence. The tendency to reach beyond oneself was identified as an essential antecedent of transcendence while spiritual perspective, pivotal life events or stressful stimuli, human work, and acceptance of an inescapable situation are proposed to be potential antecedents of transcendence. Further empirical work is needed to validate their thesis. Wainwright (1997) suggests transcendence occurs because of the individual's strong desire for norm alcy despite significant changes in health status. This theory is consistent with Baird (1992), who proposes during the process of transcendence, the individual searches for a \"new identity,\" taking the facts of the past and reorganizing them into a new \"s elf.\" She describes transcendence as an important aspect of spiritual growth that brings together the physical and spiritual paths of life. Weenolsen (1991) also identifies recreating one's identity as one of the important steps in the loss/transcendence process. Outcomes of self -transcendence Suggested outcomes of ST are numerous in the literature. The outcomes of ST suggest direct contributions to the individual's psycho/social/spiritual dimensions and indirect implications for the physical dimension. Tab le 2 (p. 49) provides a summary of these proposed outcomes and related domains. For instance, emotional well -being, increased morale, intense learning, life satisfaction, mental health, pleasure, self -esteem, 49 Table 2 Outcomes of Self -transcendence Outco me Author Psychological domain Emotional well -being Haase, Britt, Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn (1992); Hanna (1995); Young & Reed (1991) Increased morale Young & Reed (1991) Intense learning Hanna, Giordano, Dupuy, & Puhakka (1995) Life satisfaction Peck (1968); Tornstam (1994) Mental health Coward & Lewis (1993); Young & Reed (1991) Pleasure Peck (1968) Self-esteem Coward (1994) Self-worth Haase, Britt, Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn (1992) Social domain Feelings of increased connectedness with othe rs Coward (1994); Haase, Britt, Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn (1992) Decreased loneliness Walton, Shultz, Beck, & Walls (1991); Young & Reed (1991) Enhanced feelings of social consciousness Fahlberg, Wolfer, & Fahlberg (1992) Self-initiated social activi ty Tornstam (1994) Significant changes in underlying values systems Noble (1987) Spiritual domain Acceptance of personal circumstances Chinen (1986); Coward (1990a) Contact with the inner self Chinen (1986) Ease of pain and fear related to dying or lo ss Coward (1990a) Enhanced feelings of peace, unity, and social consciousness Fahlberg, Wolfer, & Fahlberg (1992) Greater self -awareness Watson (1988) Increased personal growth Coward (1990a); Haase, Britt, Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn (1992) Increase d valuing of self Coward (1990a) More -being Coward (1990a) New perspective of reality Belcher, Dettmore, Holzemer Positive personal death perspective Smith, 1995; Tornstam, 1997); Young & Reed (1991) Redefinition of or a renewed sense of purpose and meaning in life (Coward (1990a, 1994); Frankl (1969); Noble (1987); Tornstam (1997) Savoring small moments in life Coward (1990a) Sense of being healed Coward (1990a); Haase, Britt , Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn (1992); Reed, 1996) 50 and self -worth are all outcomes of ST proposed in the literature that seem to reflect the psychological domain. Positive psychological health, in turn, impacts physiologic health. All identified outcomes suggest a positive response to ST. Theoretical aspects of self -transcendence Reed's self -transcendence theory Nurse Pamela Reed (1991b) proposed a theory of ST after extensive clinical and empirical work during the 1980s. Reed's initial theory developm ent reflected the historical, societal, and economic factors of the 1980s such as increased emphasis on QOL and end of life issues and the magnitude of the aging world population. She also credits the influence of the life span theories on her formation o f the ST model, though she states no single life span theory was particularly influential. Martha Rogers' (1983) Science of Unitary Human Beings theory was used by Reed to link nursing perspective to the human development life span theories. Reed (1991b ) further delineates that social -cognitive and transpersonal theories on developmental maturity in later adulthood provided a basis for her conceptualization of ST as a developmental pattern at the end of life though she again does not specifically credit any one theorist from these disciplines with influencing her work. Self-transcendence according to Reed (1991b) is \"a characteristic of developmental maturity whereby there is an expansion of self -boundaries and an orientation toward broadened life perspec tive and purposes\" (p. 64). It is important to note a boundary -determining criterion of end -of -own-life experiences versus age is used by Reed to delineate the developmental context for terminal illness, life -threatening 51 events, chronic illness, suicidal ideation, and the aging process since these phenomenon are not limited to occurrence only in later adult years. Major assumptions of the ST theory include: 1) the human being, as a open system, defines reality and provides a sense of wholeness and connec tedness between the environment and himself by imposing conceptual boundaries on his openness; 2) these conceptual boundaries expand multidimensionally: inwardly, outwardly, and temporally; 3) self -transcendence can occur in the context of a significant li fe event and not just as a healthy characteristic of advanced age only; 4) self -transcendence is positively related to mental health as an indicator of overall well -being in persons confronted with end -of-life issues. Based on these identified assumptions , Reed (1991b) proposes there is a relationship between the fluctuations of conceptual boundaries and well -being over the life span. Life events that increase the person's awareness of the end of life, such as a terminal or chronic illness, are conceptual ized as a context of development during which an expanded self -boundary may occur. Expansion of conceptual boundaries through intrapersonal, interpersonal, and temporal experiences is developmentally appropriate in individuals confronted with end -of-own-life issues. Expansion of self -boundaries is positively related to indicators of well -being in these individuals. Reed's theory specifically proposes: 1) self -transcendence is greater in persons facing end -of-own life issues than in individuals not confro nted with such issues; and 2) self -transcendence is positively related to indicators of well -being in persons facing end -of own life issues. 52 According to Reed's (1991b) theory, ST involves connectedness with self, others, and a Higher Power. Her conceptual ization provides a useful framework for discussing other characteristics of ST: intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal. Examples of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpersonal aspects of ST supporting Reed's theory are noted in Table 3 (p. 53) . Intrapersonal aspects of self -transcendence. Intrapersonal aspects of transcendence are those which are directed at self. Reed (1992) suggests intrapersonal transcendence encompasses connectedness within oneself. Interpersonal aspects of self -transcende nce. Interpersonal aspects of transcendence address one's relationship with others and the natural environment (Reed, 1992). An example of the occurrence of interpersonal ST is provided by Coward (1990a) who found transcendence was experienced through hel ping others and being open to receiving help from others. Several authors (Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Leslie, 1985; Tornstam, 1997) stressed connectedness with others is a crucial aspect of transcendence, supporting Reed's conceptualization of interpers onal of self -transcendence. Transpersonal aspects of transcendence are those characteristics that address the temporal. Reed (1992) suggests transpersonal transcendence involves a sense of relatedness to the unseen, Go d, or a power greater than self and ordinary resources. 53 Table 3 Reed's Theoretical Aspects of Self -transcendence Supported in the Literature Intrapersonal aspects of self -transcendence An emotional awareness of a sense of well-being Coward, 1990a Increased understanding of self Conn, 1987; Coward, 1990a; Tornstam, 1997 Increasing connectedness with earlier generations Tornstam, 1997 Positive solitude Tornstam, 1996, 1997 Interpersonal aspects of self -transcendence Connecting with nature Coward, 1 990a; Hood & Morris, 1983 Connectedness with others Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Leslie, 1985; Tornstam, 1997 Helping others & being open to receiving help from others Coward, 1990a Transpersonal aspects of self -transcendence Acceptance of life Haase, Britt, Coward, Kline Leidy, & Penn, 1992; Peck, 1968 Communion or connectedness with the universe Tornstam, 1997 Experience of existence beyond the physical or psychological Decker, 1993 Grasping the larger, divine perspective or greater vie wpoint Chinen, 1986; Hanna et al., 1995; Tornstam, 1997 Healing experience Coward, 1990a Heightened spiritual awareness & spiritual emergence Fahlberg, Wolfer, & Fahlberg, 1992; Smith, 1995 Higher state of consciousness Noble, 1987 Moving beyond self & contextual limitations Conn, 1987; Coward, 1990a; Hanna et al., 1995; Tornstam, 1997 Physical lightness Coward, 1990a Relief of burden Coward, 1990a Resource for life experiences Reed, 1991a; Young & Reed, 1995 Sense of feeling uplifted Coward, 1990a Spiritual perspective Coward & Reed, 1996 54 Limitations of Reed's theory. A major limitation of Reed's ST theory is lack of specific operational definitions for the key concepts of the model. Measurable definitions of conceptual - and self -boundaries and well -being are necessary to operationalize the model further. Reed (1991b) classifies her work as an \"emerging theory\" and recognizes research must be done to identify additional boundary -determining criteria and to support or refine the proposed the oretical relationships. Further work combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches should be implemented to explore the development of and relationships between the key concepts of the models. Therapies that may be useful in helping clients to e xpand their self -boundaries during end -of-own life experiences could then be developed and tested. Other theories of self -transcendence Viktor Frankl, a psychiatist who survived the horrors of the Nazi prison camps during World War II, has contributed mu ch to the conceptualization of ST. During his three years in the Auschwitz prison camp, Frankl (1959) studied the survivorship of his fellow prisoners and noticed those individuals who survived the atrocities of the Nazis were able to transcend their predi cament to find meaning in their suffering. According to Frankl, the outcome of the prison experience for each individual (self -transcendence vs. despair) was \"the result of an inner decision and not the result of camp influences alone\" (p. 66). The decisio n to make meaning of suffering is a spiritual freedom that makes life meaningful and purposeful. Long (1999) supports Frankl's (1959) thesis that suffering is an important aspect of transcendence. Long states suffering is integral to the process of \"becom ing.\" 55 Suffering signals our limitedness. It is a \"boundary of life\" \u2014a point beyond our control. In this respect, death is an absolute limitation. Transcendence, however, is experienced as freedom to extend us beyond our temporal selves. In his personal ac count, Frankl (1959) describes how those whom spiritual life deepened during the physical and mental stressors of the camp found a \"life of inner riches and spiritual freedom\" (p. 35). In one particular moment of despair, Frankl stated he sensed his spirit \"piercing through the enveloping gloom . . to transcend that hopeless, meaningless world, and from somewhere I heard a victorious 'Yes' in answer to my question of the existence of an ultimate purpose\" (p. 39). Frankl states one of the defining features o f man is that he has the ability to rise above the biological, psychological, and sociological conditions of life to transcend them. According to Frankl, \"A human being is a self -transcending being\" (p. 132). Frankl (1959) states his personal sense of mean ing was often found in thinking of his wife though he did not know if she was alive or dead. Though she was not present, there was a spiritual connectedness between the two. Frankl also described the importance of nature's beauty to the prisoners as they t ranscended their prison experience. He states as the spiritual life of the prisoner became more intense, the beauty of art and nature was experienced as never before, sometimes allowing the prisoner to forget his own circumstances for a time. Frankl (1959) talks often of suffering in relation to self -transcendence. According to Frankl, there is meaning in suffering in that suffering is a part of life and death. It is man's response to suffering that determines whether there is a deeper meaning in life as a 56 result of the suffering experience. According to Frankl, \"Man's inner strength may raise him above his outward fate\" (p. 67). He talked of reframing one's life perspective so that \"It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life e xpected from us\" (p. 77). One interesting perspective Frankl (1959) offers regarding self -transcendence is the importance of living in the present. Frankl noted those prisoners who attempted to look into the past in order to minimize the current reality o f prison life actually lost their ability to find meaning in their suffering. Frankl suggests there are times when self - transcendence requires effort; the individual must willfully look forward to a future goal in order to transcend. Frankl described an e ffective technique of imagery that allowed him to \"rise about the situation, above the sufferings of the moment, and observe them as if they were already of the past\" (p. 73 -74). As a result of his study in the prison camp, Frankl (1959) has proposed a th erapy for promoting self -transcendence called logotherapy. According to Frankl, logotherapy focuses on the future and reorients the patient toward the meaning of his life. One of the importance tenets of logotherapy is that suffering can provide the deepes t meaning for life if the individual can find meaning in the suffering. Frankl (1959) theorizes the primary motivational force in man is finding meaning in one's life. He argues human existence is essentially ST rather than self - actualization. According to Frankl, self -actualization is really a side -effect of ST. In the social work literature, Smith (1995) describes a model of transpersonal intervention, the transegoic model, proposed to be useful for intervening with individuals 57 who are confronting their mortality. The goal of intervention is to help the individual examine issues beyond the ego (in the transpersonal realm) and achieve optimal consciousness. The model has four stages: 1) normalization of death, 2) faith in the existential self, 3) ego disa ttachment, and 4) ST. While never clearly defined, Smith suggests transcendence involves \"impulses\" which push the individual to reach an ultimate state of spiritual fulfillment. It is unclear whether the individual must be sensitive to these impulses in o rder to transcend. She relates the impulses to Reed's (1987) discussion of the \"human propensity toward transcendence\" (p. 335), suggesting an innate drive towards transcendence. Smith's (1995) model provides a useful framework for exploring transpersonal interventions. The model, however, requires further development to more clearly define the major concepts and processes of transegoic therapy. Fahlberg et al. (1992) discuss ST in the health promotion literature as a process of moving beyond a sole identi ty with the self, or self -concept (self -identity), by transcending that identity to experience a sense of unity with other human beings and the universe (transpersonal identity). These authors propose the development of ST is a result of the individual's e xperience of either a spiritual emergence or emergency. Spiritual emergency occurs as the individual experiences fear, loss, grief, and confusion as a result of giving up the former concept of self to achieve an expanded sense of identity. Spiritual emerge nce is the result of successfully moving from a self -identity to a broader transpersonal identity. Benner (1989) talks of these same concepts as crisis or transition and both provide an opportunity for spiritual growth. According to Fahlberg et al., the 58 outcome of ST is enhanced feelings of peace, unity, and social consciousness. These authors suggest \"the ego often has to suffer crisis before it opens to ST\" (p. 51). Kuuire's (1993) theory of ST is similar to that of Fahlberg et al. (1992). Kuuire states those who are aware of their spiritual dimension and who have developed it do not face or experience a crisis of transcendence. Those who have neglected the development of their spiritual dimension, however, face transcendent crisis when the non -spiritual meaning for their life is limited or crumbles. Their identity before the crisis did not incorporate the spiritual. A life -crisis, however, provides the individual with a focused opportunity for transcendence. In a thought -provoking article by McKenzie (19 91), addiction is discussed as a spiritual experience that results because the individual does not experience the transcendent dimension of life. Transcendence is described as \"foundationally human\" and \"implies a going beyond the ordinary or routine\" (p. 327). In addiction, McKenzie proposes transcendence is repressed or neglected in favor of other human dimensions such as physical, psychological, or social. Because of this neglect, the longing for meaning and purpose that can lead to transcendence is inst ead manifested as addiction. McKenzie suggests the transcendent dimension of life is the only source of authentic spiritual existence, that which results in satisfying the foundational human longing for meaning and satisfaction in life. Baird (1992) writes about mid -life as a transcendent crisis, but gives general principles regarding self -transcendence. According to Baird, crisis facilitates change (transition) leading to growth. Similar to Kuuire's (1993) perspective, Baird notes a 59 growing realization of limits in an individual's life may facilitate transcendence or a single traumatic event may foster transcendence. Relationships are reevaluated. According to Baird, the ambiguity of life may be a direct antecedent of transcendence. For instance, the indivi dual with chronic liver disease may have a desire to experience life fully, but is limited by fatigue and physical deterioration. There may be regrets related to the past and a fear of a diminished future. Life at this point is described by Baird as a \"dar k night\" experience. Baird (1992) proposes during the crisis of transcendence, the individual often realizes the need to search for a \"new identity\" which the individual hopes is already existing somewhere within the self. The challenge is to take the fac ts of the past and reorganize them into a new \"self\" through the process of transcendence. Baird emphasizes reflection is an important key to the transcendent process. She states the transcendence process makes meaning for the present from the experience o f the past. This thesis is unlike Frankl's (1959) belief that individuals are more likely to experience self-transcendence by living in reality and hoping for the future (thought Frankl does not preclude using past experiences). Clearly the importance of r eflection to the self - transcendent process requires further investigation. Baird's (1992) theory that transcendence is a process involving establishment of a new identity as a result of crisis suggests newly transplanted individuals (e.g., less than two ye ars post -transplant) will have lower ST than those transplanted individuals who have redefined self over time. Outcomes of transcendence according to Baird are 60 reflected in actions such as new ways of human bonding, wider forms of love, and commitment to t he universal concerns of humankind as well as personal needs. Weenolsen (1991) suggests a transcendence of loss theory. Loss is defined by the theorist as anything that diminishes life and self (the persons' identity) and is described as a \"small death.\" L oss may be major or minor, actual or threatened, chosen or imposed, internal or external, direct or indirect, and time relevant or irrelevant. Transcendence involves overcoming the loss and recreating life and self. According to Weenolsen (1991), loss may be transcended by dealing with it situationally (getting a new job to replace a lost job) or dispositionally (through the strengths of one's mind, emotions, personality, and spirit). General transcendence mechanisms can also be used to deal with loss such as watching movies or television, reading, participating in favored activities such as art, travel, religion, or sports, or the use of alcohol or drugs. These general mechanisms are used in general instead of specifically to deal with the smaller daily lo sses experienced in life such as stress, boredom, or anxiety. Within her theory, Weenolsen (1991) proposes loss and transcendence seem to occur in two phases: mourning (grieving and searching) and resolution (replacement and integration). At any time in an individual's life, he or she is in one stage or the other. If in the mourning phase, the individual is loss oriented. If in the resolution phase, the individual is transcendence oriented. In her research, Weenolsen noted those individuals most often in th e transcendence oriented phase believed life had meaning. 61 Tornstam (1996), a Swedish social gerontologist, developed a theory of gerotranscendence that he says encompasses change, development, and maturation of the self and the identity. He describes gerot ranscendence as a shift in metaperspective from a midlife, materialistic and rational vision to a cosmic, transcendent vision of life that is accompanied by an increase in life satisfaction. Clearly, Tornstam associates gerotranscendence with age instead o f life circumstance. Tornstam (1996) suggests gerotranscendence increases as a normal process of living. Gerotranscendence is intrinsic and independent of culture, though modified by specific cultural patterns. Tornstam suggests while the process of develo ping gerotranscendence is continuous, development can be accelerated by a life crisis. His thesis is that many elders are labeled as \"disengaged\" when they are actually experiencing gerotranscendence. Research on self -transcendence Few empirical studies of transcendence exist to date in the literature. Table 4 (p. 62) provides an overview of research focused on self -transcendence. Reed (1986, 1989, 1991a) and Tornstam (1994, 1996, 1997) have made significant contributions empirically, but their work has fo cused on transcendence in the later stages of life. Coward (Coward, 1990a, 1994; Coward & Lewis, 1993) has provided depth and broadened our understanding of transcendence through her qualitative investigation of adults. Findings from these studies sugges t transcendence is associated with mental health (Reed, 1986, 1989, 1991a), well -being (Reed, 1986, 1989; Smith, 1995), an increased sense of self -worth (Coward, 1990a), connectedness to others and God 62 Table 4 Overview of Self -transcendence Research Researcher(s) Population Sample size Research design Findings Coward (1990a) Women with advanced breast cancer n = 5 Exploratory ST involves effort; associated with increased sense of self -worth, purpose in life, and interconnectedness with others Coward (1 991) Women with Stages III & IV breast cancer n = 107 Correlational ST decreased illness distress through the mediating effect of emotional well -being Coward & Lewis (1993) Gay men with AIDS n = 8 Phenomenology ST associated with feelings of increased interconnectedness with others, sense of well -being and meaning and purpose in life; ST required energy Coward (1995) Women with AIDS n = 10 Phenomenology ST is associated with emotional well -being, receiving from & giving to others, & maintaining hope Coward (1996) Healthy adults n = 152 Descriptive correlational ST strongly correlated with sense of coherence, self-esteem, hope, and emotional well -being Mellors, Riley, & Erlen (1997) Adults with HIV n = 46 Descriptive correlational ST was positively corre lated with QOL for the most compromised patients (AIDS or CD4 count < 200) (n = 23) Reed (1986) Terminally ill & healthy adults n = 114 (2 groups of 57/group) Comparative Both groups had moderately high levels of well-being; positive relationship between well- being and religiousness (aka spiritual perspective which Reed identifies as a reflection of transpersonal ST) in the healthy group 63 Table 4 (continued). Reed (1987) Terminally ill hospitalized adults; nonterminally ill hospitalized adults; health y non-hospitalized adults n = 300 (3 groups of 100/group) Comparative Spiritual perspective (reflects transpersonal ST) was higher in the terminally ill hospitalized adult group; positive relationship in this group between spiritual perspective and well -being Reed (1989) Older adults n = 30 Descriptive correlational Negative correlation between self - transcendence and depression Reed (1991) Oldest -old adults n = 55 Triangulation Relationship between ST and mental health; support for Reed's theory Wainwr ight (1997) Adults with end-stage liver disease who had undergone liver transplantation n = 10 Grounded theory 2-stage framework of transcending chronic liver disease was proposed 64 (Coward, 1990a), increased appreciation of things dear and of the environ ment (Coward, 1990a), and life satisfaction (Tornstam, 1994). Age, gender, and life circumstances (crisis, profession, income) (Tornstam, 1997) are also positively correlated with transcendence. In her early work, Reed (1986) matched terminally ill and he althy adults (n = 114) on four variables (age, gender, education, and religious affiliation) to compare differences in religiousness and sense of well -being. Reed defined religiousness as the perceptions of one's beliefs and behaviors that express a sense of relatedness to spiritual dimensions or to something greater than the self. Well -being was defined as a sense of satisfaction with one's current life. Reed found terminally ill adults reported greater religiousness than healthy adults (one -tailed t = 3. 11, p < .001). Being both female and terminally ill contributed significantly to greater religiousness [F (1,113) = 4.205, p < .05]. There was no difference between the groups on sense of well -being with both indicating moderately high levels [two -tailed t (112) = 0.84]. A positive relationship between religiousness and well-being was found in the healthy group (r = 0.43, p < .001), but not in the terminally ill group. Reed states this finding was not unexpected since ambulatory terminally ill persons may be similar to non -terminally ill persons in their ability to engage in activities that give life meaning, a correlate of well -being. Building upon the previous study, Reed (1987) sampled terminally ill and non - terminally ill adults (n = 300) for relations hips between spiritual perspective and well - being. The participants were divided into three groups of 100 adults (terminally ill hospitalized adults; non -terminally ill hospitalized adults; and healthy non -hospitalized 65 adults) matched on age, gender, educ ation, and religious background. She found terminally ill hospitalized adults (Group 1) indicated greater spiritual perspective on the Spiritual Perspective Scale (SPS) than either non -terminally ill hospitalized adults (Group 2) or healthy non -hospitaliz ed adults (Group 3) [F (1,297) = 5.16, p = 0.02]. There was no difference between Group 2 and Group 3 mean SPS scores. Reed also found a positive relationship between spiritual perspective and well -being in the terminally ill hospitalized group (r = .22, p < 0.02). Reed hypothesized this finding may indicate persons who are not facing end -of-life experiences may utilize resources other than transcendence that correlate with well -being. A significantly greater number of terminally ill adults indicated a re cent change toward increased spirituality than did non -terminally ill or healthy adults (x2 = 10.70, p < 0.01). In addition, change in spiritual views was found to correlate positively with SPS scores in each group with the most significant correlation (r = .44, p < 0.001) occurring in the terminally ill hospitalized group. In 1991, Reed (1991a) sampled 55 independent -living older adults, 80 -97 years old, for patterns of ST older adults report as being important to their emotional well - being. Results of q ualitative and quantitative data analysis indicated ST is related to mental health among the oldest -old. Pearson correlation analysis indicated significant inverse relationships between ST and depression scores (r = -.33, p < 0.01) and between ST and ment al health symptomatology scores (r = -.32, p < 0.01). These findings are consistent with Reed's earlier studies of ST in younger elders. She notes although the correlation is somewhat smaller than that found in her previous work, the increase of interind ividual differences characteristic of older adults may offer explanation for the 66 difference noted in the current study. Matrix analysis of qualitative date also identified four specific cluster categories of transcendence practices that were related to th e elder's sense of well -being: generativity (altruistic involvement), introjectivity (inner -directed activities), temporal integration (past, present, and future), and body transcendence (integration of physical changes into one's current life). Additional studies of ST by Coward (1990a; 1991; Coward & Lewis, 1993) support Reed's development of the ST theory. Coward (1990a) found in her exploratory study of ST in women with advanced breast cancer (n = 5) that participants found meaning in their lives in th e face of unchangeable life -threatening illness. Self - transcendence occurred after much effort on the part of the women, particularly at the level of acceptance when they realized the adverse situation of having Stage IV breast cancer could not be changed . Coward (1991) also studied the relationships among ST, emotional well -being, and illness -related distress in a convenience sample of 107 women with Stage IIIb and Stage IV breast cancer. Using a factor analytic structural equations modeling approach to data obtained from administration of Reed's Self -Transcendence Scale, Bradburn's Affect Balance Scale, Cognitive Well -Being Scale, McCorkle's Symptom Distress Scale, and the Karnofsky Performance Scale, Coward found ST decreased illness distress through th e mediating effect of emotional well -being. Self -transcendence directly affected emotional well-being (beta = 0.69). Emotional well -being had a strong negative effect on illness distress (beta = -0.84). She concluded women with advanced breast cancer do experience the capacity for personal development as manifested through a sense of positive well -67 being and satisfaction with life that is related to reaching beyond (transcending) their illness concerns. Coward ( Coward & Lewis, 1993) extended her earlie r work by studying the structure of ST in eight gay men with AIDS. She found additional support for Reed's theory in that the informants found an increased sense of mental well -being as they reached out beyond themselves towards a broader perspective of w hat was most important to them, participated in activities that led to achievement of new goals, and worked towards increased connectedness. As she noted in her earlier study, ST did not come easily for these men. Coward stressed there was strong suggest ive evidence in this study that participants consistently evaluated their giving to others as self -enhancing and self-affirming activities. Mellors et al. (1997) conducted a study of ST and QOL in 46 patients diagnosed with HIV. These researchers used mea sures selected for this study: Reed's (1991a) Self - Transcendence Scale (STS) and Ferrans and Powers (1992) Quality of Life Index (QLI). While there were no statistically different ST scores for the subjects when grouped according to clinical categories, th ose subjects in Clinical Category B (n = 10; Symptomatic HIV and CD4 count >200) had the highest mean score (M = 3.21; SD = .42; possible range is 1 -4) and those in Clinical Category C (n = 23; AIDS defining condition or CD4 count < 200) had the lowest (M = 2.97, SD = .50). The broadest range of ST scores was seen in Category C (1.93 -3.80). The researchers suggest initial symptom development may be a motivating factor for ST while progression to AIDS may be an inhibiting factor. Greater variability in ST w as noted in Category C, possibly 68 reflecting the variability of the disease within this clinical category. The authors also suggest there may be unidentified confounding variables such as depression or hopelessness that contributed to the variability in the ir study findings. Another obvious limitation of the study is the small group sizes that may have prohibited analysis of subtle changes between groups. Quality of life scores for the total group ranged from 7.63 to 26.60 (M = 19.14, SD = 4.78; possible ran ge is 0 to 30) (Mellors et al., 1997). Analysis of QOL data relative to clinical categories revealed QOL showed a general decline as the disease progressed. Subjects in Clinical Category A (n = 13; Asymptomatic HIV and CD4 count > 200) had the highest scor e (M = 22.02), subjects in Clinical Category B scored a mean of 22.02, and subjects in Clinical Category C had a mean score of 16.73. As ST increased in this group of HIV patients, there was a corresponding increase in QOL (Mellors et al., 1997). There was a significant moderate positive correlation between ST and QOL for Clinical Category C (r = 0.54, p < 0.01) and for the total group (r = 0.46, p < 0.01). suggesting ST is an important aspect of QOL for patients with chronic illness. Significant correlatio ns were also found for the total group between ST and the health and functioning QOL subscale (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) and the psychological/spiritual subscale (r = .45, p < 0.01). The mean score for the health and functioning domain of the total sample (M = 1 8.11, SD = 5.49) was the lowest subdomain QOL score. The correlation suggests ST may be enhanced as individuals face compromised levels of health and functioning. In turn, subjects had a mean score of 20.04 (SD = 6.23) on the QOL psychological/spiritual s ubscale. Correlations between ST 69 and this QOL domain suggests that as an individual embraces the psychological and spiritual perspectives associated with their chronic health state, ST may be facilitated. Due to the small sample size, additional investigat ion is warranted to further clarify the strength and nature of these relationships. Self-transcendence and chronic liver disease Only one study was found addressing ST and chronic liver disease and no studies were found addressing ST and liver transplanta tion. Wainwright (1997) studied 10 liver transplant recipients who had undergone transplantation for end -stage liver disease (ESLD). The researcher used a grounded -theory approach to explore the experience of transcendence in patients with ESLD. Informants retrospectively described their adjustment to chronic liver disease prior to transplantation. Wainwright described a two - stage framework of transcendence that emerged from the data: becoming ill and not living. Becoming ill involved interpreting the sign s and dealing with the experience of increasing physical limitations and an eventual significant decline in physical and emotional status; and maintaining independence in managing the illness, despite increasing physical disabilities (Wainwright, 1997). Th e attitudes of friends and family often made the period of doubting and interpreting their illness more difficult for informants, particularly when the assumption was often made that alcohol abuse was involved in the development of the informants' liver di sease. Despite the deterioration in their physical health, informants fought to maintain their independence by learning to manage their illness during this stage. Management of illness involved integrating the 70 illness into their lifestyle by remaining pos itive, wanting independence, having a sense of humor, and relying on support of family and friends. Not living was the second stage of transcending chronic liver disease (Wainwright, 1997). Informants noted as their bodies physically deteriorated, independ ence was lost. Many described feelings of being disabled and of being treated like invalids by family and friends. There was an overwhelming desire to regain lost independence and live a normal life. The opportunity for liver transplantation provided informants hope the disease could be cured. Wainwright (1997) suggests transcendence occurs during illness because of the individual's strong desire for normalcy despite significant changes in health status. While the researcher never proposes a clear definit ion of transcendence following data analysis, he seems to suggest transcendence is a coping mechanism that enables individuals to maintain a sense of normalcy in life despite the debilitating effects of chronic illness. Self-transcendence and fatigue Several authors have suggested ST involves effort (Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Hanna et al., 1995; Joffrion & Douglas, 1994). Because of the fatigue associated with liver disease, this perspective has implications for the liver transplant recipient populatio n. Wainwright (1997) noted fatigue was frequently mentioned by informants (n = 8) in his study of the pre -transplant experience for liver transplant recipients and was described as overwhelming. Commander et al. (1992) found lack of energy was a common po st liver transplant complaint. Paris et al. (1997) noted fatigue during the post - transplant experience influenced employment status for liver transplant recipients. 71 Irvine, Vincent, Graydon, Bubela, and Thompson (1994) define fatigue as a subjective feeli ng of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy that varies in degree, frequency, and duration. The North American Nursing Diagnosis Association defines fatigue as \"the self recognized state in which an individual experiences an overwhelming sustained sense of exhaustion and decreased capacity for physical and mental work that is not relieved by rest\" (Carpenito, 1997, p. 379). While studied extensively in the oncology population, fatigue has also been studied in populations including those with arthritis (Wolfe, Kong, & Watson, 2000), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (Small & Lamb, 2000), pregnancy and postpartum (Lee & Zaffke, 1999), HIV (Grady, Anderson, & Chase, 1998), myasthenia gravis (Grohar -Murray, Becker, Reilly, & Ricci, 1998), multi ple & Rogers, 1997), and myocardial infarction (Varvaro, Sereika, Zullo, & Robertson, 1996). No specific studies of fatigue in the liver transplant population, however, were noted in the literature. Fatigue is associated with symptom s of emotional upset, pain, muscle weakness, sleep problems, and disruption in concentration ability (Broeckel, Jacobsen, Horton, Balducci, & Lyman, 1998; Hann et al., 1997; Sharpe, Wessely & Powell, 1989; Wessely, Hotopf, & Sharpe, 1998). Based on the observations made by other researchers (Asante, 1984; Coward, 1990a; Hanna et al., 1995; Joffrion & Douglas, 1994), it has been suggested fatigue could limit the achievement of higher states of ST in patient's with compromise d energy. This proposition also suggests a lack of energy might actually prohibit ST from occurring. Because of the suggested association 72 of fatigue and ST, the relationship between fatigue and ST will be explored further in this study of liver transplant recipients. Measurement of self -transcendence Few tools for measuring ST are found in the research literature. Reed (1991a) developed a 15 item Self -Transcendence Scale (STS) to measure the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and temporal dimensions of transcen dence. The tool was initially developed for administration as an interview in order to capture the depth and richness of the subject's perceptions of their experience of each item, but has been utilized as a quantitative measure of ST as well. Subjects ar e asked to identify on the STS to what degree each item describes how they see themselves based on a four point Likert scale (Reed, 1991a). The response scale ranges from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Examples of the types of items utilized on the STS scale include: \"At this time of my life, I see myself as: 1) accepting myself as I grow older, 2) adjusting to the changes in my physical abilities, 3) finding meaning in my past experiences, and 4) putting aside some things I once thought were so importa nt. Analysis of the STS using Cronbach's alpha range from .80 to .93 suggesting the tool has strong reliability. Secondary analysis using Heise's model established the test - retest reliability to be .95. Reed also reports construct validity has also been s upported in several additional studies as well (Britt, 1989; Malcolm, 1989). While the STS has impressive reliability and validity, the tool has most often been used in the elderly population. Mellors and associates (1997) found the STS to be reliable (Cro nbach's alpha 73 = .86) in their HIV -positive study sample. Further study of this tool in other cohort groups is clearly indicated to further establish its usefulness in measuring ST. Walton, Shultz, Beck, and Walls (1991) reported the development of a Self - Transcendence Scale for Older Adults (STSO) which they developed from a ST scale written for young adults (Christensen, 1980). The STSO is a 58 -item Likert scale based on Peck's (1968) developmental stages of old age. Content validity was established by 10 geropsychiatric experts. Unfortunately, the authors do not report any statistical analysis of the tool related to reliability nor do they provide a description of the items. The author's lack of detailed discussion of the tool and the absence of statistic al data regarding reliability limits evaluation of the STSO's credibility for measurement of ST. Vandecreek and Nye (1993) documented a follow -up study of the validity and reliability of Hood and Morris's (1983) Death Transcendence Scale (DTS). Death transcendence is unfortunately never clearly defined by the researchers, but suggests death transcendence is a reflection of an individual's ability to overcome their finitude with identification with phenomena more enduring than the self. The DTS consists of 2 3 items on a Likert scale divided into five subscales: mystical, religious, nature, biosocial, and creative. In the original study, Hood and Morris tested the DTS using college students as subjects (n = unknown). Unfortunately, no report of statistical rel iability from the Hood and Morris findings were mentioned in the secondary report by Vandecreek and Nye. Vandecreek and Nye (1993) tested the scale in several different adult cohorts reporting they used the same approach as Hood and Morris (1983) in the original study. 74 Group one consisted of 166 adults from community organizations such as a choral group, a woman's service organization, and a Civitan club. Demographics for this group included 80% female, mean age of 55 years, 97% white, 63% married, and 54 % college graduates. Seventy three percent of this group were Protestant. Group two consisted of 132 patients and 141 family members from a large university -related tertiary care hospital (N = 273). Sixty -six percent were female, mean age was 45.5 years, 8 4% were white, 68% married, and only 21% were college graduates. Sixty -four percent were Protestants, 15% Catholic, and 16% identified religious affiliation as \"other\". Factor analysis of data gathered from both groups revealed the mystical, religious, and creative subscales loaded similarly to the previous findings of Hood and Morris (1983). In both groups, however, items from the nature subscale tended to co -mingle with the religious subscale. In Group 1, two of the nature items also co -mingled with the biosocial subscale. Cronbach's alpha for the DTS based on data from Group 1 was .79, and .74 for Group 2. The DTS appears to be a worthwhile measure of death transcendence in adult populations. Further reliability testing is indicated in more diverse popul ations with comparisons analyzed between groups based on demographic differences such as age, gender, and educational background. It is possible death transcendence may occur differently for these different subgroups. In addition, Vandecreek and Nye (1993) reported that several subjects in both groups found some of the mystical items ambiguous, particularly those worded negatively. Additional work to refine the tool and increase reliability seems warranted 75 Tornstam (1997) reported on a 26 -item survey used i n his study of gerotranscendence (n = 2002). The survey was developed based on data gathered from previous qualitative and quantitative studies (Tornstam, 1994, 1996) supporting content validity. Three dimensions of gerotranscendence based on Tornstam's th eory were captured in the survey: cosmic (space, time, objects), coherence (self/ego -integrity), and solitude (changed meaning and importance of relations). Regretfully, Tornstam also provides no statistical report of reliability for this instrument, preve nting objective evaluation of the empirical credibility of the instrument for measuring transcendence. Haase et al. (1992) caution an important consideration in evaluating instruments designed to capture a changing process is the reality of low to moderate test-retest reliability coefficients. Further investigation into the dynamic nature of ST during significant life events and varied developmental stages may enhance identification of the appropriateness of specific instruments for measuring ST more precis ely. In conclusion, few validated measures of ST have been reported in the literature. The Self -Transcendence Scale (Reed, 1991a) has impressive reliability, but requires further validation in populations other than the elderly. Other tools reported in the literature are lacking in empirical description of reliability and validity. Clearly, additional research should be focused on developing valid measures to capture the phenomenon of ST. Summary of self -transcendence literature Current knowledge of ST acr oss several disciplines suggests the importance of this crucial process in promoting positive life outcomes. Conceptual discussions as well 76 as empirical findings imply ST is an important developmental task of end -of-life that may have an important role dur ing other crucial moments of life as well. Based on the review of literature, ST is defined in this study as a dynamic process reflecting spiritual growth and maturity in which the individual is able to broaden his or her personal perspective beyond physic al, psychological, and social boundaries to validate meaning and purpose for challenging life experiences. There is a need for further study regarding the potential for ST across the lifespan as well as the significance of ST in fostering well -being and QOL in individuals at various stages of wellness. Because it has been suggested energy is required for ST to occur, the relationship between fatigue and ST requires further investigation, particularly because of the frequent experience of fatigue in patie nt populations associated with chronic illness. While no studies of ST in liver transplant recipients has been reported, previous work in the area of ST provides an exciting impetus for investigation into this important dimension of spirituality. Quality o f life Quality of life (QOL) has become an important outcome measure in recent years for evaluating the value and impact of health care. Health care providers are concerned with QOL because it may affect decisions regarding prescribing habits, treatment regimens, and decisions to cease treatment. Studies of QOL offer greater understanding into the impact of illness and treatment and help health care providers determine whether a given intervention is beneficial in terms of clinical changes, individual perce ptions, or economic benefits (Spilker, 1996). In fact, because of the economic implications for 77 health care, Molzahn (1991) suggests QOL is as important as survival rates when evaluating outcomes related to specific treatment options. Unfortunately, opera tional definitions of QOL in the research literature are often lacking, and when present, suggest a general lack of consensus among researchers (King et al., 1997; Molzahn, 1991). The lack of a clear definition for QOL has created doubt, confusion, and mis understanding among practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and patients (Lepl\u00e8ge & Hunt, 1997). Quality of life, however, is an important measure of patient response to health -related issues and deserves further investigation despite the challenges of conceptual ambiguity. Definitions and characteristics of quality of life Ferrans (1990) and Cohen, Mount, Tomas, and Mount (1996) define QOL as a subjective sense of well -being. Others describe QOL as the person's perceived degree of satisfaction with pres ent life circumstances (Young & Longman, 1983), that which makes life worth living (Padilla & Grant, 1985), the satisfaction of needs (Ferrans & Powers, 1985), functional status (Jette et al., 1986), and health status (Bergner et al., 1976). The World Hea lth Organization (1993) defines QOL as an individual's' perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value system in which they live and in relation to their goals, standards, and concerns. The domains reflected in the definition include physical health, psychological state, levels of independence, social relationships, environment, and spiritual concerns (Grant & Rivera (1998). Mast (1995) suggests the reason for this diversity, generality, and lack of consensus regarding a singl e definition of QOL results from the abstract nature of the 78 phenomenon and its few directly observable and clearly identifying characteristics. She notes most nurse researchers have used the broad conceptual categories of perceived life satisfaction and n ormal functional status as indicators of QOL. King and Hinds (1998), however, argue that both global and more narrowly focused definitions of QOL may be useful in science. The key is in determining the purpose of the study or project and selecting the most appropriate conceptual definition and measurement approach. King et al. (1997) found QOL is most often described as falling along a continuum. King et al. suggest QOL is an evolving phenomenon whose meaning is developed over time through social and scient ific interaction. King (1998) suggests there are general areas of agreement in QOL work in that QOL consists of both positive and negative facets of life, is multidimensional, subjective, and dynamic. Other characteristics of QOL consistently mentioned in the literature include perceived satisfaction and happiness (Mast, 1995; Oleson, 1990b). Quality of life is affected by numerous factors including culture, age, and medical diagnosis though some of these influential factors may not be amenable to nursing interventions (eg., diagnosis, predisposing characteristics, medical treatment). Other influential factors, however, such as environment, symptom management and information are easily influenced by nursing (Grant & Rivera (1998). Haas (1999) notes severa l terms are used interchangeably with QOL including functional status, satisfaction with life, well -being, and health status. She defines QOL as a primarily subjective sense of well -being that encompasses the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual dimensions. According to Haas, objective indictors of QOL such as 79 functional status can be used as a proxy assessment of QOL if subjective indicators can not be obtained. Within the QOL literature, disagreement has been voiced regarding conceptualization o f QOL as unidimensional versus multidimensional. Molzahn (1991) has suggested people tend to reflect on their lives as a whole when asked about QOL and QOL should therefore be measured as a single dimension. Most authors, however, have argued for a multidi mensional definition of QOL. King et al. (1997) suggest one global, unidimensional definition of QOL may not capture the true status of the reporting individual. Based on an extensive review of QOL literature related to oncology care, King and associates noted QOL in oncology is usually defined in terms of four dimensions: physical, psychological, social/role functioning, and symptoms. General dimensions of QOL most often reported in the literature include the physical, psychological, social, spiritual, a nd somatic or disease and treatment related symptoms (King, 1998). Examples of the physical domain include functional ability, strength or fatigue, sleep and rest, nausea, and appetite. Aspects of the psychological QOL domain include anxiety, depression, e njoyment or leisure, pain distress, happiness, fear, and cognition. The social domain is reflected as caregiver burden, roles and relationships, affection or sexual function, and appearance. The spiritual domain in QOL is most often reflected as suffering, meaning and purpose in life, and religiosity. After review of several large studies of QOL (Bostick, 1977; Campbell et al., 1976; Flanagan, 1978), Burckhardt (1985) notes the domains of QOL are similar for 80 Americans regardless of health status. She state s the degrees of QOL, however, vary considerably and correlate with numerous variables. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to evaluate correlations, antecedents, and outcomes of QOL globally due to the diversity of definitions and lack of conceptual clarity across studies. As more attributes of QOL are discovered through research and clinical methods, definitions, and descriptions of QOL will change accordingly. King et al. (1997) proposes it may be premature to expect a single definition of QOL and furth er suggests the meaning and importance of QOL may be discipline -specific. Quality of life broadly conceptualized, however, can still provide a common framework for clinical practice across health -care disciplines despite nuances specific to a discipline's unique perspective (King et al). Measurement in QOL research There are essentially two types of QOL measures: global or disease specific. Global QOL tools encompass nonhealth -related domains such as work satisfaction, social interaction, or hobbies. Most o f the QOL work with transplant patients has involved the use of generic rather than disease specific tools. Global tools allow for comparability across different disease states but do not focus on a particular domain of QOL and may lack responsiveness to t he effects of health care on disease specific aspects of QOL. Disease specific tools, conversely, reduce subject burden and tend to have increased patient acceptability, but prohibit the ability to compare results with individuals from other disease groups (Wainwright, 1994). Global QOL is less sensitive to minor changes 81 while specific QOL instruments are often not comprehensive and cannot be used for comparison across diseases or conditions (King, 1998). Other classifications of QOL measures include healt h profiles, utility measures, and health related quality of life (HRQOL) tools. Health profiles measure different aspects of QOL such as functional aspects of life or the effect of disease. Utility instruments reflect economic aspects of QOL along a contin uum of death to full health with an emphasis upon quality adjusted life years (King; Lepl\u00e8ge, & Hunt, 1997). Health related quality of life tools focus on QOL related to health, illness, and treatment, but may have limited usefulness in healthy individuals since a well person's conceptualization of QOL may not include health (Lepl\u00e8ge & Hunt). In fact, Lepl\u00e8ge and Hunt argue measuring specific HRQOL is probably impossible because health status is interconnected with other aspects of QOL such as economic stat ues, work status, social relationships, and coping strategies. Lepl\u00e8ge and Hunt also criticize the use of utility measures for evaluation of health states because people value the same state differently at different times and people have different preferen ces that become meaningless when data are aggregated. It has been argued there is simply no perfect way to measure QOL given the current state -of-the-science and the complex nature of the QOL construct (Haberman & Bush, 1998). Lack of agreement on a univer sal definition of QOL, disagreement on whether QOL is a unidimensional or multidimensional concept, use of subjective versus objective measures of QOL, and the use of QOL assessment in clinical decision -making are problematic issues in QOL measurement (Mol zahn, 1991). Lepl\u00e8ge and Hunt (1997) 82 state that because QOL instruments differ, we often may have really only obtained data about life and nothing about quality. King and Hinds (1998) caution QOL measures developed for research purposes do not necessarily transfer to clinical practice and suggest there is a potential for misuse if QOL measures are not used by knowledgeable people in the right context. There are no clear answers to the question of how to best measure the elusive concept of QOL. Because of th e impact of QOL on decisions related to health care, researchers must continue to strive for measures that are consistent with the study population's conceptualization of QOL. Whether QOL evaluation is performed for clinical or scientific reasons, assumpti ons regarding the investigator's perception of QOL should be validated as consistent with the focus population prior to initiation of data collection. Research studies of quality of life and liver transplantation As is unfortunately typical in the QOL lite rature, most of the studies addressing QOL and liver transplantation are inconsistent in their conceptualization of QOL. Most studies involve cross -sectional data and data regarding the pre -transplant QOL for liver candidates is almost nonexistent. Qualit y of life in liver transplant recipients In a phenomenological study of the lived experience of people with liver transplants (n = 13), Thomas (1993b) noted those informants who had fewer expectations for a better life following liver transplant demonstra ted a better acceptance of the post - transplant changes in their life style. Participants who viewed themselves as ill or sick 83 viewed their QOL as poor while those who perceived themselves as well, healthy, and normal, even if dealing with post -transplant c omplications, exhibited a positive life outlook. This observation suggests the need for research to study whether pre -transplant expectations affect post -transplant perceptions of QOL. Thomas reports informants in her study overall were satisfied with the outcome of their transplant and felt their QOL had improved from before the transplant. In an early descriptive study of QOL in liver transplant recipients, Tarter, Erb, Biller, Switala, and Van Thiel (1988) described preliminary data from three patient groups on psychosocial and physical aspects of QOL. In the first group, ten patients with an average of three years since liver transplantation were evaluated. Data were obtained from both the patient and a significant other (usually a spouse). Mean scores for symptoms of physical distress were in excess of the 95th percentile when compared to the normal population. In addition, scores on the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) compared to the subject's pre -transplant status revealed greater than 20% increase in impairment for sleep, work, recreation, and appetite. The SIP is a measure of health status that can be interview - or self -administered and includes 136 items addressing aspects of physical and psychosocial QOL including ambulation, mobility, body care and movement, communication, alertness and emotional behavior, social interaction, sleep and rest, eating, work, home management, and recreation and past -times (Damiano, 1996). A 15% impairment was observed for overall physical and psychosocial functioning wh ile intelligence, memory, and communication abilities were intact (Tarter et al., 1988). 84 Analysis of a second group ( n not reported) of liver transplant recipients at pre - transplantation and average two years post -transplantation using the SIP revealed an increase in all areas of functioning (Tarter et al., 1988). The greatest improvements were in social interactions (18%), home management (25%), alertness (27%), recreation and leisure activity (20%), and general psychosocial functioning (17%). These findi ngs do not support the initial study, yet the researchers propose no theory to explain the difference in findings. Finally, a group of 66 subjects were evaluated at one -year post -transplant for general health status (Tarter et al., 1988). Sixty -five percen t of the subjects reported they were still very concerned about their health and monitored it closely. Ninety percent of the single (one time) transplant subjects (n = 56) stated they had minor or no job -related problems and 97% of this group stated they c ould do their jobs very well. None of the single transplant subjects had been absent from work for the 30 days prior to data collection. The majority of single transplant subjects reported they were adjusted to their home life, work, and social environment . Tarter et al. (1988) noted the experiences of multiple -transplant recipients (2 -4 transplants) (n = 10) were not as positive as the single -transplant recipients. Fifty seven percent of these subjects felt they were totally prevented from performing the ir job. Of those working, only 60% felt they could do their jobs very well. Forty percent had been absent at least two weeks during the month prior to data collection. Significantly more multiple -transplant subjects were depressed (X2 = 4.0, p < .05). Only 11% of the 85 multiple -transplant recipients reported no problems in household management. These findings suggest QOL is negatively impacted by repeat liver transplantation. Bonsel, Essink -Bot, Klompmaker, and Sloof (1992) conducted a longitudinal descript ive study of changes in QOL for 14 Dutch liver transplant patients based on physiologic, psychologic, functional, and well -being indicators. Subjects reported significant improvement from pre -transplant to three months post liver transplantation for energ y (p < .001), sleep (p < . 01), functional status (n = . 02), well -being (n < . 001), depression (p = . 04), physical complaints (p < . 01), health satisfaction (p < .001), leisure time satisfaction (p = .02), daily activities satisfaction (p = .04), and s atisfaction with life as a whole (p < .01). This pilot study provided longitudinal data for liver transplant recipients that had been missing from the literature (Bonsel et al., 1992). While this sample size was extremely small, initial indications suppo rted the notion that patients perceive improved QOL in the physiologic, psychologic, and health and functioning dimensions following liver transplantation. Missing from the study, however, are indicators of the family, spiritual, and economic dimensions o f QOL. While the social dimension was addressed as social isolation (p > .1), the finding of no statistical difference between pre - and post -transplant scores in this area is difficult to interpret since it is not known if the subjects perceived social is olation prior to transplantation. Nicholas, Oleske, Robinson, Switala, and Tarter (1994) surveyed 166 post -liver transplant patients for QOL based on physical functioning, endurance, vocational role, and financial status. This descriptive study focused o n the likelihood of patients to return to active employment following liver transplantation. The mean age of the sample was 86 45.5 years with 49.4% of the subjects being male and 50.6% female. Fifty -five percent of the subjects were reported to be in \"white collar\" occupations, 35% in \"other\" occupations, and 10% reflected subjects who reported no occupation or did not provide a response to the question. The group was evenly divided educationally with 50% having a high school diploma or some high school edu cation and 50% having completed all or some of a baccalaureate college education. Subjects self -reported a 95% or greater level of independence since liver transplantation for activities of daily living such as eating, dressing, grooming, bathing, toileti ng, hand skills, and walking (Nicholas et al., 1994). Endurance was markedly improved (p < .00 1) as was physical ability reported as the ability to walk three blocks or more for at least two times each week (p < .00 1). The presence of post -transplantatio n musculoskeletal symptoms (weakness = 36.7%, loss of full motion = 5.4%, pain = 18. 1 %, gout = 11. 4%, arthritis = 40.4%) significantly affected this group's likelihood of employment (p < .0001). Patients without pain, weakness, or arthritis were 7.8 tim es more likely to be employed post -transplantation (Nicholas et al., 1994). The Nicholas et al. (1994) study analyzed only functional and economic parameters of QOL. Findings in this group of subjects indicated musculoskeletal symptoms significantly and ne gatively impacted post -transplant employment, yet it is curious subjects reported increased independence in activities of daily living. Because of the musculoskeletal side effects associated with steroid therapy, which is routinely used in post -transplant management, further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted. Nicholas et al. (1994) also found increased endurance and physical function in their 87 sample, suggesting a contradiction of Leyendecker et al.'s (1993) findings of exhaustion in post -transp lant recipients. The subjects in the Nicholas study were compared, however, against themselves pre -transplant and subjects in the Leyendecker et al. study were compared with healthy patients. The effects of routine post -transplant medical therapy may cont ribute to increased exhaustion when compared with healthy individuals, yet be significantly improved over the pre -transplant state. A more recent descriptive study looked at QOL improvements after liver transplantation at one, two, and five years post -transplant (Levy et al., 1995). Five - hundred seventy -three questionnaires were completed over eight years by liver transplant patients at a regional transplant center in North Texas. Regretfully, subjects participating throughout the length of the study were not matched with the data they provided at each time point. Researchers administered the National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIADDK) liver transplantation QOL form over a period of eight years to pre -transplant and o ne, two, and five year post -transplant patients. Quality of life indicators studied included self -perception/image (symptom frequency/distress, feeling about life), functional status, health perception, and employment status. The findings of this study (L evy et al, 1995) revealed perceived health status, self - image, and ability to function were significantly improved as early as one year post - transplantation and continued through the fifth post -transplant year. The stability of these indicators of QOL ove r time are consistent with the findings of other studies (Andrykowski, Henslee, & Barnett, 1989; Andrykowski, Henslee, Ferrell et al., 1992; and Haberman, Bush, Young, & Sullivan, 1993) and suggest certain aspects of QOL may stabilize over time. Overall, scores of health perception were significantly higher for post transplant time points when compared with pre -transplant (p < .0001) (Levy et al., 1995). Symptom distress scores also improved significantly post transplant (p < .0001); howev er, symptom frequency was no different (p < .20). These findings are consistent with those of Hicks, Larson, and Ferrans (1992) and suggest liver transplant recipients may adapt to the frequency of illness symptoms over time. The economic dimension of QOL can be related to work history, which was reported in this study (Levy et al., 1995). Nearly two -thirds of patients were working for pay pre -transplant (62.2%). This percentage dropped significantly (p < .0001) at one year post-transplant (39.2%), but re turned to pre -transplant level by five years post -transplant (69.7%). Levy et al. (1995) provide a cross sectional look at functional and economic QOL over a five -year period following liver transplantation and support previous findings that QOL significa ntly improves for patients following liver transplantation. Social, spiritual, and family dimensions of QOL, however, were not studied. Another study limitation is the likelihood sicker patients most likely dropped out of the study or died, causing the longitudinal data to be positively inflated by those participants who had less co - morbidity. LoBiondo -Wood and associates (1997) conducted a descriptive correlational longitudinal study of QOL in liver transplant recipients. Using Ferrans and Powers 89 (1985) Qu ality of Life Index -Liver Transplant Version (QLI -LT) to measure subjective QOL, data were collected at the pre -transplant evaluation time and at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post -transplant. Forty -one subjects who were at least 19 years of age and who were abl e to read and write English participated in the study. Mean age was 50.3 years (range 19 to 64 years). Significant main effects over time for QOL were found in overall QOL [F(4, 160) = 19.30, p < .001, MS = 7.65] and in the domains of health fun ctioning [F(4, 160) = 14.30, p < .001, MS = 16.4] and psychological/spiritual [F(4, 160) = 14.01, p < .001, MS = 14.29] (LoBiondo -Wood, Williams, Wood, & Shaw, 1997). A significant increase in overall QOL and the subdomains of health functioning and psychological/spiritual was noted from the pre -transplant period to all post -transplant time periods. There were no statistically significant differences for pairwise comparisons of the post -transplant time periods. Demographic analysis revealed incom e and age correlated significantly with overall QOL (LoBiondo -Wood et al., 1997). At six months post -transplant, income was positively and significantly correlated with overall QOL (r = .37, p < .01) and with the subdomains of health and functioning (r = . 33, p < .05), psychological/spiritual (r = .31, p < .05), and socioeconomic (r = .40, p < .01). Age correlated significantly with the socioeconomic domain at 3 months post -transplant (r = .43, p < .01) and at 6 months (r = .32, p < .05). Gusick (1994) an alyzed secondary data for 22 subjects (13 women, 9 men, mean age = 48.4 years) who had participated in a longitudinal study of QOL in liver transplant 90 recipients. Inclusion criteria required subjects to be age 19 years or older; oriented to time, place, an d person; able to read and write English; and at least 5 -years post transplant. Ferrans and Powers (1985) Quality of Life Index (Liver Transplant Version) was used to measure QOL on a scale of 0 -30 with 30 being high QOL. Results of this descriptive corre lational study revealed an overall QOL score for the sample was a mean of 23 (range 16.92 -28.5, SD 2.7) (Gusick, 1994). Domain scores (reported as means) were 23.82 for psychological and spiritual (range 16.81 -27.75, SD 3.07), 23.69 for health and function ing (range 15.46 -30, SD 3.21), 20.43 for socioeconomic (range 14.06 -26.25, SD 3.45), and 25.75 for family (range 7.25 -30, SD 4.82). Significant correlations were noted for overall QOL and age (r = .63, p = .002), number of times in the hospital (r = -.65, p = .009), length of hospital stay (r = -.57, p = .027), and hospitalization due to infection (r = -.54, p = .038) (Gusick, 1994). Significant correlations were also found between the psychological/spiritual score and age (r = .54, p = .009), practicing religion (r = -.69, p < .001), and hospitalization due to infection (r = -.90, p < .0001); scores on the health and functioning subscale and age (r = .59, p = .003, number of times in the hospital, (r = -.66, p = .007), length of hospital stay (r = -.56, p = .029), and hospitalization due to infection (r = -.51, p = .051); and socioeconomic subscale scores and age (r = .52, p < .014). These findings (Gusick, 1994) clearly show increased age correlated with an increased QOL sati sfaction while number of times hospitalized and length of hospital stay were correlated with a decrease in QOL satisfaction for these subjects. Overall QOL 91 scores for these subjects at five years or greater since transplantation were high which is consiste nt with other groups of liver transplant recipients. Geevarghese and colleagues (1998) conducted a longitudinal comparative study of QOL. These researchers evaluated 100 liver transplant recipients (68% male, 32% female; mean age 46, range 14 to 64 years) for functional status, psychosocial adjustment to illness, and financial data. Data were measured at pre -transplant (n = 100), 3 months (n = 88), 6 months (n = 85), 1 year (n = 82), 2 years (n = 63), 3 years (n = 43), 4 years (n = 29), 5 years (n = 17), and 6 years (n = 5). Functional status was objectively scored by transplant coordinators using the Karnofsky performance status (KPS). Over a four-year period, scores on the KPS were significantly improved (p <.0001) for those subjects remaining in the stu dy. Repeated measures analysis of variance showed statistical significance in improvement for each time point up to 4 years (p <.0001) with scores leveling off thereafter at a high score. The Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS), a subjective measure of functional, emotional, and social dimensions of QOL, was administered to each subject at some point during their transplant experience (range 0 -72 months) providing a cross - section in time analysis of this measure (Geevarghese et al., 1998). PAI S subscales measure general health, vocational capacity, domestic atmosphere, sexual performance, extended family support, social support, and psychologic distress. High scores represent poor functioning and adaptation to life. Global scores showed statist ically significant improvement when the cross -sectional data were plotted over time (p < .001) as did sexual performance and domestic environment (p < .001). Clinically significant 92 improvement was also noted for vocational environment, psychological enviro nment, social environment, health care environment, and extended family environment. Financial data revealed median hospitalization charges of $95,600 (mean $112,000 + 5,000) including organ procurement fees. One noticeable limitation of the Geevarghese et al (1998) study is the small number of subjects in the post -transplant cohorts after three years. In addition, changes in the psychosocial adjustment to illness over time were inferred from cross -sectional data. Clearly, additional studies with a larger number of subjects in each cohort are needed to validate these study findings and to provide more insight into the level of QOL attained over time. Gubby (1998) conducted a descriptive comparative cross -sectional study of QOL in liver transplant recipien ts (n = 30; 10 subjects per group) using a health -related QOL measure based on the Kidney Transplant Recipient Stress Scale (KTRSS). Participants were asked to identify stressors that caused them concern from a list of 25 potential transplant -associated st ressors. The tool was divided into four subscales: physical health, social health, functional ability, and psychological well -being. Patients in Group A (0 -12 months post liver transplant) identified possibility of rejection, general education of the public about transplantation, and possibility of repeated hospitalizations as their highest ranked stressors. Group B (1 -5 years post liver transplant) identified their most stressful concerns as general education of the public about transplantation, possibili ty of liver rejection, weight gain, and changes in body appearance. Group C (5 years or more post 93 liver transplant) scored their highest stressors as general education of the public about transplantation, changes in body appearance, and possibility of reje ction. Comparisons of commonalties among groups at varying time points revealed stressors experienced by the transplant recipients varied at different time intervals during the post -transplant period (Gubby, 1998). Differences in ranking of stressors betw een Groups A and C (p < 0.013) and Groups B and C (p < 0.006) were noted. There were no significant differences, however, between Groups A and B. These findings are consistent with other studies assessing for differences in liver transplant recipients base d on time since transplantation and suggest changes in QOL during the first five years after liver transplantation are nonexistent or the tools used to measure these changes are not sensitive enough to detect subtle changes. Continued investigation into th ese differences is warranted with larger samples, however, before drawing final conclusions. Seiler, M\u00fcller, Fisch, and Renner (1998) compared QOL in 29 liver transplant recipients (16 women and 13 men) and healthy volunteers using the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and a visual analog scale (VAS). Subjects were asked to rank their current QOL and retrospectively rate their QOL during the month prior to their liver transplant (Seiler et al., 1998). Data were gathered randomly on two separate occasions at le ast one week apart. Median age of study subjects was 57 years (range 37 -75 years) and median time since liver transplant was 31 months (range 1 -106 months). Seven age -matched healthy volunteers (5 women, 2 men; median age 50 years) served as QOL controls. Pre- transplant perception of overall QOL assessed by either tool was impaired compared to controls. Overall QOL as measured by both SIP and VAS had significantly improved 94 from pre -transplant scores and was within the range of controls for more than 50% of subjects. Physical parameters of QOL measured by the SIP were impaired in a slightly higher percentage of transplant subjects both pre - and post -transplant when compared to the psychological parameters. An interesting finding of this study related to abi lity to work (Seiler et al., 1998). Prior to transplantation, only one third of the subjects felt able to work at least 50% of a normal daily work schedule. After transplantation, however, 79% of the subjects were judged by their physicians as able to work 50% or more and 17/29 regained full ability to work. Unfortunately, those who had lost their job prior to liver transplantation were less likely to find work post -transplantation even when judged able to work by their physician. The researchers suggested it is important to transplant patients earlier in their disease process, prior to \"social and professional disintegration,\" in order to maximize their ability to reintegrate back into the work force. Hicks, Larson, and Ferrans (1992) conducted a comparativ e study of 35 liver transplant patients. The subjects were divided into two groups: a short -term group who had been transplanted for two years or less (n = 18) and a long -term group transplanted for more than two years (n = 17). There were no significa nt differences between the groups with respect to age and years of education. All but one of the subjects was Caucasian and most were married (94% of short -term, 89% of long -term). The Quality of Life Index, Liver Transplantation Version (QLI -LT) (Ferran s & Powers, 1985) was used to measure QOL in the Hicks et al. (1992) study. Quality of life scores for this group of subjects were high regardless of the length of time since 95 transplant and despite a significant level of health -related problems in function al status that increased over time. The mean overall QOL score in this sample (M = 22.2) was noted to be similar to the mean score reported for a healthy group (M = 21.67) of subjects (Ferrans & Powers, 1985) as well as a bone marrow transplant group (M = 21.6) (Belec, 1992). The scores on the family dimension reflected the highest QOL score (M = 25.4) followed by health and functioning (M = 22.7) (Hicks et al., 1992). Interestingly, though the long -term group demonstrated more physical impairment as meas ured by the SIP, there were no differences between the two groups' scores regarding their perceived QOL in the domain of health and functioning. The authors suggest these subjects may have adjusted their expectations of their health in order to cope more successfully. The psychological/spiritual domain (M = 21.3) was the second to lowest ranking of QOL scores followed by the socioeconomic domain (M = 20.9). Leyendecker and colleagues (1993) compared QOL outcomes in 45 German liver transplant recipients (2 6 men, 19 women) to QOL outcomes for healthy adults. Average time since transplant was nine months and average age of the sample was 46 years (range 24-66). Six aspects of QOL were measured including physical complaints, mood dimension, ability to particip ate in everyday life, psychological well -being, social relationships, and global QOL. Complaints of exhaustion and rheumatism were found to be more prevalent in the study group than in the general population and subjects reported more total complaint distr ess than the general population. Patients with extrahepatic 96 diseases suffered from more general complaints than those without (t = 2.27, p < .05) and reported lower QOL (t = 2.29, p < .05). Post-transplant subjects in the Leyendecker et al. (1993) study r eported they were able to actively participate in everyday life and cope well with demands such as health, daily living, social life, psychological state, and medical care. Eighty percent of the subjects reported having high social support from family or friends and 60% regarded their QOL as very high while 31% gave medium scores. Correlations for single components of QOL compared with global QOL included psychological state (r = . 80, p < .001), daily life (r = .74, p < .001), health (r = .69, p < .001 ), social life (r = .59, p < .001), gastric complaints (r = -.58, p < .001), good mood (r = .57, p < .001), activity (r = .52, p < .001), relaxation (r = .44, p < .01), medical care (r = .43, p < .01), and exhaustion (r = -.37, p < .01). High QOL scores were most prominent in the group of working patients though the researchers stressed it was not possible to determine whether employment was responsible for the high scores or whether restored QOL allowed the transplanted individual to return to wor k. Most subjects in the Leyendecker et al. (1993) study felt they were able to actively participate and cope with everyday life. Data analysis revealed subjects, in fact, coped better with medical care than a healthy control group, but did not differ in a reas of everyday life, social life, psychological state, or health. Only 5% of the sample reported severe anxiety or nervousness. Twelve percent reported feelings of anger. Psychological well-being in the previous month was slightly higher than the healthy control group. 97 Compared to their pre -transplant QOL, 60% of subjects ranked their global QOL as high (Leyendecker et al., 1993). Thirty -one percent ranked their QOL as medium and 9% compared their current QOL with their worst time in life. Patients who w ere actively working had the best scores on all measures of QOL and these findings were statistically significant (p < .05). The researchers conclude QOL seems to be associated with the ability to cope independently with everyday life and maintain normal a ctivities across various aspects of life. These findings support a grounded theory study by Wainwright (1997) who found the stage of \"not living\" occurred when informants lost their independence. Reported findings for this study (Leyendecker et al., 1993) suggest similarities with other studies of QOL in liver transplant patients. The researchers, however, did not report the actual statistical findings for many of their parameters, making it difficult to fully assess the implications of their findings. Th e parameters studied, however, were reflective of the four dimensions of QOL described by Ferrans (1994). While the researchers highlighted in this review used a multidimensional approach, QOL was not measured consistently. None of the physician researc hers specifically addressed the spiritual dimensions of QOL. Most of these studies used quantitative measures of QOL. None investigated QOL relative to the individual's pre - transplant expectations for QOL following the transplant. QOL & transplant -relate d demographic factors Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers (1976) suggest demographic factors such as age, marital status, income, and condition -related variables will correlate with QOL. 98 Disease chronicity, pre -transplant medical and treatment history, age, and gender are examples of demographic factors that Tarter and associates (1988) propose as influences on QOL. Findings from the literature, however, suggest inconsistent relationships between many demographic variables and QOL (see Table 5, p. 99). Age h as been found to be significantly correlated with overall QOL for liver transplant recipients (Cameron Gusick, 1994; Hicks et al., 1992; LoBiondo -Wood et al., 1997). Age was also found to be significantly and positively correlated with the so cioeconomic domain of QOL (Cameron Hicks /spiritual domain of QOL (Gusick; Hicks et al.), the health & functioning domain (Gusick) and family (Cameron -Duncan). Factors associated with hospitalizati on have been theorized to be associated with QOL in liver transplant recipients. While Gusick (1994) found significant correlations between overall QOL, length of hospital stay, and number of hospitalizations post - transplant, LoBiondo -Wood and associates ( 1997) did not find significant correlations for these same variables. These differences in findings may be attributed to the differences between time periods studied in each investigation. Gusick looked at individuals who were at least five years post -transplant while LoBiondo -Wood 's sample consisted of individuals only 18 months post -transplant. Individuals who have survived for five years post-transplant have the potential for more hospitalizations during their survival period than those patients surviv ing for only 18 months. Cameron -Duncan (1993) did find a significant correlation between times hospitalized and total QOL in 108 patients one year post liver transplant, but there was not a significant relationship between length of 99 Table 5 QOL and liver transplant recipient demographic factors Study Sample QOL & demographic factors Statistical findings Cameron -Duncan (1993) n = 108, ?= 86, ?= 75 ? more satisfied with QOL than ? in family domain F = 5.73, p = 0.018 (age = covariate) F = 6.28, p = 0.01 3 (# of times hospitalized = covariate) F = 6.03, p = 0.015 (length of hospitalization = covariate) Chappell (1999) N = 139 ? = 57, ? = 82 Comparisons between: Total QOL scores and gender groups (? x = 54.89, SD = 14.22; ? x = 49.31, SD = 14.29) F = 6.0 8 (1, 127), p = .0150 Gusick (1994) n = 22 Correlations between: Total QOL & age Psychological/spiritual domain and age Health & functioning and age Socioeconomic & age Total QOL & length of hospital stay post - transplant Total QOL & number of hospita lizations post - transplant r = .63, p < .002 r = .54, p <.009 r = .59, p <.003 r = .52, p <.014 r = -.57, p = .027 r = -.65, p = .009 Hicks, Larson, & Ferrans (1992) n = 35 Correlations between Total QOL & age Total QOL & socioeconomic Total QOL & psychological/spiritual r = .39, p <.05 r = .47, p <.05 r = .47, p <.05 100 Table 5 (continued).

Gender may also play a role in QOL for liver transplant recipients. Chappell (1999) found statistical differences for gender on several measures of QOL in 139 liver transplant recipients. The mean score for over all QOL as reported by men was higher than women. While there was no statistically significant difference between males (n = 82) and females (n = 57) at the initial evaluation point, males reported significantly higher QOL at one year after transplantatio n and at two years after. Cameron -Duncan (1993) found significant differences between males (n = 75) and females (n = 86) in some domains of QOL. While no significant differences were found based on gender for total QOL, males were more satisfied than fema les with the family domain of QOL at one year post-transplant. Women were noted to be more satisfied with their QOL if they were older, had fewer dependents, and fewer hospitalizations. Severity of illness has been found to significantly correlate with QO L. Bryan and associates (1998) noted patients (n = 121) who had more severe illness pre -transplant, as indicated by a Child Pugh class C assignment, were more likely to report better health - related QOL following transplantation. These researchers also foun d duration of the disease at the time of transplantation was important. Patients who had been chronically ill for five years or more at the time of transplantation scored lower on mental health as measured by the SF -36 than patients who had been ill for a shorter time. The researchers suggested being in a \"sick role\" for so long may make readjusting to a \"healthy role\" more difficult. 102 Summary of QOL literature Quality of life is an important outcome measure for evaluating the value and impact of health car e, particularly in chronic patient populations. Unfortunately, there is a lack of consensus regarding the conceptualization of QOL contributing to confusion and misunderstanding regarding many aspects of clinical care. Measures of QOL are varied and should be selected according to the nature, population, and purpose of the proposed study. Within the transplant population, various studies of QOL have been published, though conceptualization of QOL is inconsistent across these studies. While nursing supports a holistic assessment of QOL in subjects with alterations in health, little study has been done regarding the spiritual aspect of QOL in liver transplant recipients. Work in other chronic illness populations, however, suggests the importance of this aspect of QOL for chronically ill patients similar to liver transplant survivors (Cohen et al., 1996; Haberman et al., 1993; Hall, 1990; O'Connor, Wicker, & Gerinino, 1990; Reed, 1987). For the purposes of this study, Ferrans and Powers (1992) conceptualization of QOL as a multidimensional construct composed of four interrelated and overlapping domains was used. QOL is defined within this framework as a person's sense of well - being that stems from satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the areas of life that are important to him or her (Ferrans & Powers). Summary of literature review Liver transplantation is the only treatment of choice for chronic liver disease. The illness distress associated with liver disease and transplantation involves every aspect of 103 the in dividual's life (physical, psychological, social, and spiritual) and impacts the individual's QOL, an important outcome measure of life satisfaction and well -being. Investigation into the impact of liver transplantation on QOL, particularly the spiritual domain, however, is currently lacking. In addition, conflicting data exist regarding the importance of specific demographic variables and QOL in liver transplant cohorts. ST, a complex, dynamic process reflecting spiritual growth and maturity, has been shown to be associated with positive life outcomes, particularly at the end of life. Spiritual awareness precipitated by a life crisis or life challenge, such as liver failure, is thought to precipitate the process of ST. Little is known, however, about ST in liver transplant recipients. Fatigue, a source of illness distress in liver transplant survivors, has been suggested as a barrier to ST, but no studies have assessed the relationship of fatigue to ST. Research has verified many liver transplant recipie nts experience a high level of QOL following transplantation. Studies regarding QOL in this patient population, however, are varied and difficult to compare due to differences in conceptualization and measurement of QOL. As a result, explanations regardin g the important influences affecting QOL in liver transplant recipients remains unclear. Spiritual issues have been noted to be important to QOL in other patient populations with advanced disease, though there is little investigation into the importance of this domain for the liver transplant population. This study provides insight into the relationship between ST and QOL in liver transplant recipients. Based on an extensive review of literature, a model for investigating 104 the relationship between ST and QO L was tested (Figure 1). Variables with particular relevance to ST and QOL in the liver transplant recipient were identified in the literature and studied. These variables included illness distress, fatigue, gender, age, and time since transplantation. 105 CHAPTER III METHODS The purpose of this descriptive correlational comparative study was to describe relationships and differences in level of ST and QOL for liver transplant recipients. Demographic variables of interest (e.g., gender, ethnicity, educatio nal level, level of fatigue, and level of illness distress) were also evaluated. A cross -sectional design was selected due to time and economic constraints. Participants were grouped as time -since- transplant cohorts in order to identify potential changes i n ST and QOL that may be reflected relevant to a specific time period in the transplant survivor process. This chapter describes the population and sample, procedures for data collection, instrumentation, data analysis, and consent procedures utilized in t he study. Population and sample The target population for this study was all adult liver transplant recipients residing in the United States. The accessible population included all adult liver transplant recipients treated in the department of Transplantat ion Services at Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC) in Dallas, Texas and Washington University Medical Center (WUMC) in St. Louis, Missouri. The study sample was obtained from those liver transplant recipients who responded positively to a letter aski ng them to voluntarily participate in this study. Upon initiation of the study, letters (n = 1,458) were mailed from each of the participating institutions to all liver transplant recipients who met the study criteria. To be eligible to participate in the study, participants had to be at least 18 -years of age, have received only 106 one liver transplant, and willing and able to complete the questionnaire regarding their experiences as a liver transplant recipient. BUMC mailed 1,084 letters of invitation (74%) a nd WUMC mailed 374 letters (26%). In response to the invitation to participate, 590 individuals from BUMC (54% of those invited) and 196 individuals (52% of those invited) from WUMC indicated an interest in participating in the study. Research packets were mailed to these 786 individuals. Of these, 471 respondents returned usable packets for a 59% response rate (BUMC = 354 [75% of total sample]; WUMC = 117 [25% of total sample]). Procedures for data collection An introductory letter from the researcher a nd an accompanying letter from the sponsoring physician at each site were mailed to all surviving liver transplant recipients on the transplant recipient mailing lists of BUMC (Appendix A) and WUMC (Appendix B) transplant programs. In order to protect pati ent privacy, initial mailings were coordinated by a research assistant selected by each transplant institution. The introductory letter briefly outlined the purpose of the investigation and invited individuals to participate in the study by completing a ba ttery of four questionnaires (see Appendix C). The questionnaire battery was projected to take approximately 30 -45 minutes to complete. Interested respondents who met the study criteria were asked to return to the researcher a pre -stamped letter of inter est (provided by the researcher) indicating their name and mailing address. A research packet was then mailed to these individuals. The research packet consisted of a demographic information sheet and the battery of four 107 questionnaires (Appendix A). Consen t forms (Appendix D & E) and a pre -stamped, addressed envelope for return of all study questionnaires to the researcher were included in the research packet. Instrumentation King et al. (1997) suggests the success of any instrument or series of tests will be related in part to the burden imposed on respondents and their willingness to participate. To ease burden for both the respondents and the researcher, all data collection forms in this study were presented to participants in a Teleform \u00ae format. Four m easurement tools and a demographic sheet to measure participants' current levels of QOL, ST, illness distress, and fatigue were used to collect a comprehensive and rich data set. The measures were presented to participants as a single battery of tests cons isting of 127 items. The demographic sheet included questions about basic descriptive information. Five focused questions related to the study variables that were inspired by literature review were also posed to participants at the end of the instrument ba ttery. Self-Transcendence Scale Self-transcendence was measured in this study using Reed's Self -Transcendence Scale (STS) (1991a). Reed developed the 15 -item unidimensional Self -Transcendence Scale to measure the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and transpers onal dimensions of transcendence consistent with her theory. This quantitative tool can also be administered as an interview in order to capture the depth and richness of the individual's perceptions of their experience of each item. 108 The STS uses a four -point response scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much). Higher scores respresent higher levels of self -transcendence. Reed (1991a) stresses the scale was designed to avoid bias towards individuals who are physically challenged by measuring manife stations of ST through creative, social, and introspective avenues. She also emphasized the STS is able to account for individual differences since a low score on one item can be offset by a high score on another item. To calculate the STS score, the subj ect's scores for items 1 through 15 are added together. This score is then divided by the number of items answered (allows for missing data). The possible range is 1.0 to 4.0. Reed (personal communication, September 25, 2000) notes that in some published s tudies using the STS, the STS score was calculated based upon the sum only, in which case the possible range reported was 15 to 60. Dividing this sum by the number of items answered results in the comparative scores ranging from 1.0 to 4.0. Analysis of the reliability of the STS using Cronbach's alpha ranges from .72 to .94 (Coward, 1996, 1998; Reed, 1991a; Upchurch, 1999). Secondary analysis using Heise's model established the test -retest reliability to be .95 across three measurement points. Reed reports construct validity has also been supported in several additional studies (Britt, 1989; Malcolm, 1989). Reliability of the STS for the current study using Cronbach's alpha was .81. While there is evidence to support the reliability and validity of the STS, the tool has been used most often in studies of the elderly (Chin -A-Loy & Fernsler, 1998; Klaas, 1998; Reed, 1991a; & Upchurch, 1999). Coward used the tool with women with breast 109 cancer (Coward, 1990a, 1998) and healthy adults (Coward, 1996). Mellors and a ssociates (1997) found the STS to be reliable (Cronbach's alpha = .86) in their HIV -positive study sample. Further study of this tool in the liver transplant population supports its usefulness in measuring ST across diverse populations. Quality of Life In dex-Liver Transplant QOL was measured in this study using the Quality of Life Index, Liver Transplantation Version (QLI -LT) (Ferrans & Powers, 1985). The QLI was developed to measure the QOL of both healthy and ill individuals. The tool, written at a 3rd grade level, consists of 72 questions divided into two equal sections: satisfaction and importance. Each question consists of a six -point Likert -type scale assessing the four domains of QOL identified within the conceptual framework: health and functioning , social and economic, psychological/spiritual, and family. The satisfaction measure ranges from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 6 (very satisfied) and the importance measure ranges from 1 (very unimportant) to 6 (very important). Total score range is from 0 -30. Higher scores represent higher levels of QOL. Examples of health and functioning satisfaction items include: \"How satisfied are you with a) your health? b) your transplanted liver? c) the amount of energy you have for everyday activities? The corresponding importance items ask \"How important to you is a) your health? b) your transplanted liver? c) the amount of energy you have for everyday activities? Social and economic items include questions such as: \"How satisfied are you with a) your friends? b) the em otional support you get from people other than your family? c) your home, apartment, or place where you live? Psychological/spiritual item 110 examples include \"How satisfied are you with a) your peace of mind? b) your faith in God? c) being satisfied with lif e? Family items include questions such as \"How satisfied are you with a) your children? B) your family's happiness? c) your spouse, lover, or partner? Each satisfaction item has a corresponding importance item. To score the QLI, satisfaction scores are mul tiplied by importance scores for each item to obtain adjusted item scores (Ferrans, 1990). This method assures the most important life aspects have the greatest influence on total QOL scores for each subject. Individual item scores are then summed and divi ded by the total number of items answered to determine a total QOL score The QLI also allows for a QOL score for each of the four domains. To determine domain scores, only the items within each domain are scored using the method noted above. The QLI has be en used extensively in clinical populations including persons with cancer, cardiac, end stage renal disease, HIV/AIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple sclerosis, stroke survivors, transplant, and the general population (graduate students, older women, K orean -American women) (C. Ferrans, personal communication, September 26, 2000). The QLI is unique in that it measures subjective satisfaction in each domain of QOL as well as the importance of each domain to the subject. Internal consistency reliability f or the QLI (total scale) using Cronbach's alpha (r = .84 to .98) has been established across more than 20 studies (C. Ferrans, personal communication, September 26, 2000). Cronbach's alpha calculation for the reliability of the QLI in the current study w as .97. Cronbach's alphas for the four subscales have been published in 11 studies that have provided support for internal consistency of the 111 subscales. Alphas ranged from .70 -.93 for the health and functioning subscale, from .73 to .89 for the social and economic subscale, and from .80 to .93 for the psychological/spiritual subscale. For the family subscale, alphas were acceptably high in 10 studies, ranging from .63 to .92. In this study, Cronbach's alphas were .94 for the health and functioning subscale, .86 for the social and economic subscale, .91 for the psychological/spiritual subscale, and .77 for the family subscale. Test-retest correlations for the total scale were .87 with a two -week interval and .81 with a one -month interval (Ferrans & Powers, 19 85). Correlations of .78 were also found with a three to four -week interval (Rustoen, Wicklund, Hanestad, & Burckhardt, 1999). Content validity of the QLI is based upon the fact the tool was developed from an extensive literature review of issues related to QOL and on the reports of patients regarding the quality of their lives (Ferrans & Powers, 1985). Support for content validity also was provided by an acceptably high rating using the Content Validity Index (Oleson, 1990a). Construct validity for the Q LI is well established. Convergent validity was supported by strong correlations between the overall (total) QLI score and Campbell, Converse, and Rodgers' (1976) measure of life satisfaction (r = .61 - .93) (Anderson & Ferrans, 1997; Bliley & Ferrans, 199 3; Ferrans, 1990; Ferrans & Powers, 1985, 1992). Further evidence for construct validity was provided by factor analysis which revealed four dimensions underlying the QLI: health and functioning, social and economic, psychological/spiritual, and family. T he factor analytic solution explained 91% of the 112 total variance. Factor analysis of the four primary factors revealed one higher order factor that represented QOL (Ferrans & Powers, 1992). The contrasted groups approach was use to further support construct validity. Subjects were divided into groups on the basis of self -reported levels of pain, depression, and success in coping with stress (Ferrans, 1990). Subjects who had less pain, less depression, or who were coping better with stress had significantly h igher overall (total) QLI scores. In another study, those who had higher incomes had significantly higher QOL scores on the social and economic subscales verifying construct validity of the social and economic subscale (Ferrans & Powers, 1992). Sixteen int ervention studies have been published in which QLI scores were found to be sensitive enough to detect a change in QOL. The QLI scores changed significantly over time when compared before and after an intervention in all studies (Ferrans, personal communica tion, September 26, 2000). Illness Distress Scale Illness distress was measured in this study using the Illness Distress Scale (IDS) (Noyes et al., 1990). While the tool had only been used in a study of 400 cancer patients (Noyes et al., 1990), the IDS app eared to be a reliable and valid measure of distress associated with serious illness. The scale contains 22 items ranked on a 5 -point likert scale. The higher the score, the higher the illness distress. Possible item scores range from 0 (none) to 4 (extrem ely). Scores are obtained by summing all items to obtain a total illness distress score for a possible score range of 0 -88 (Noyes, personal communication, January 23, 2001). Subjects are asked to identify \"To what extent have any of the 113 following concerned or distressed you during the past week, including today?\" Item examples include: a) loss of energy or strength? b) having to depend on others? c) thoughts of death? d) loss of meaning in life? e) loss of or injury to body parts? Subscales for the tool inc lude loss of meaning, physical disease, medical treatment, and social isolation. Subscale scores for each individual are obtained by summing the score for each subscale item. Previously reported Cronbach's alpha for the IDS is .93 for the total scale and as follows for each of the subscales: loss of meaning, .90; physical disease, .84; medical treatment, .75; and social isolation, .79. Cronbach's alpha for the IDS in the current study was .92. Subscale scores were not calculated. Adapted Lee Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue Level of fatigue was measured using the 13 -item fatigue subscale from the Lee Visual Analog Scale for Fatigue (VAS -F) (Lee, Hicks, & Nino -Murcia, 1991). Higher scores indicated higher levels of fatigue. According to the VAS -F author, ea ch item is anchored with a descriptor obtained from the literature and content analysis of personal interviews with patients complaining of fatigue. The descriptors include aspects of energy and vigor as well as fatigue. Subjects are provided an example of how to complete the tool and are then asked to identify how they currently feel in relation to each item. The VAS -F consists of two subscales: a 13 -item Fatigue Subscale (FS) (items 1 -5 and 11 -18) and a 5 -item Energy Subscale (items 6 -10). For the purpos es of the current study, data were analyzed only for the Fatigue Subscale. A complete Teleform \u00ae version 114 of the VAS -F containing 18 items (both fatigue and energy scales) in a likert -scale format was used instead of the visual analog format. Cronbach's al pha for the FS in the current study was .95. Reliability for a numerical version of the VAS -F (1-10 likert rating scale) in a study of 24 oncology patients was .96 (Miaskowski & Lee, 1999). Lee (personal communication, March 27, 2001) reports initial Cronb ach's alpha using the 21 -item numerical rating scale version in ongoing studies is .76 with cancer patients and .82 with their caregivers. Previous alpha coefficients for 75 healthy subjects on the VAS version of the FS were .94 and .95 (n = 57) (Lee et a l., 1991). Concurrent and convergent validity of the fatigue subscale was supported by correlating scores with the Profile of Mood States and the Stanford Sleepiness Scale (r = 0.58 to 0.81). Energy subscale alpha coefficients for healthy subjects was .94 to .96 (Lee et al.). The tool has been used in studies of childbearing women (Lee & Zaffke, 1999), healthy individuals and patients undergoing evaluation for sleep disorders (Lee et al., 1991), oncology patients receiving radiation therapy for bone metast ases (Miaskowski & Lee, 1999), sleep deprived subjects (Morris, So, Lee, Lash, & Becker, 1992), women with chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia (Schaefer, 1995), and women with HIV (Lee, Portillo, & Miramontes, 1999). Pilot study of QOL in liver trans plant recipients As part of the preparatory work for initiating this doctoral dissertation, the author undertook a qualitative pilot investigation to determine how liver transplant recipients described their QOL. After obtaining the appropriate IRB approv als, thirty -six potential 115 informants were contacted through a local support group regarding the individual's interest in participating in the study. The support group leader was instructed to solicit study participation from informants who could provide in sight into all aspects of QOL post-transplantation including those who may have had either positive or negative experiences. Potential participants were required to be at least 18 -years of age, able to think and express their thoughts verbally, the recipie nt of only one liver transplant, and able to communicate directly or via an interpreter for up to a 90 minute session. Twelve informants (7 females, 5 males) agreed to participate in a 60 -90 minute tape-recorded interview. The twelve informants ranged from 41 to 68 years of age. Time since transplantation ranged from 2 to 10 years. Eleven informants identified themselves as associated with a religious denomination and one informant stated she saw herself as spiritual though she had no religious affiliatio n. The sample included 10 Caucasians, one Hispanic, and one Italian American. Current health status was ranked \"excellent\" by four informants, \"good\" by six, \"fair\" by one, and not ranked by one. Eleven informants were married and one had never been marrie d. Five informants reported they were on medical disability, three were employed full -time, three were retired, and one informant marked retired and medical disability. Informants were advised prior to initiation of the interview they would be asked to dis cuss their QOL as a liver transplant recipient. During the interview, informants were specifically asked, \"What is important to you in your life right now?\" Additional probing questions, such as \"How is your life better or worse since your transplant?\" and \"How 116 has your life changed since your liver transplant?\" were initiated by the investigator to clarify informant comments and provide more depth of understanding. Analysis of findings revealed informants focused on positive aspects of QOL such as increas ed levels of health, increased sensitivity to the everyday joys of life, and improved relationships. \"My life after the transplant was like being reborn.\" \"Life has become less of a chore and more the making of important memories.\" Most informants talked of the desire to give something back to society because of the gift of life they had been given. Many are involved in donor awareness efforts. They often expressed gaining pleasure and a sense of purpose from volunteer work with pre - and hospitalized tran splant recipients and described enjoyment in sharing their personal stories to inspire those who are still hoping for a restored life. Almost all study participants said they now enjoy each day to the fullest and don't take life for granted. \"Today is a t reasure!\" \"Life won't ever be the same, even if it is better (after the transplant).\" Family was identified by all but one informant as being an extremely important part of their life now. \"I couldn't do this by myself.\" Health was also frequently mention ed. Most described currently enjoying activities such as gardening, fishing, cooking, or reading. The three informants (2 female, 1 male) who were employed full - time were extremely involved in their jobs and took great pride in being able to maintain active careers. Several informants mentioned they now are more spiritually oriented instead of just religiously oriented. Several also stated it was very easy for them to now talk about 117 their death with their loved ones and plan for it. It was almost as if the ir fears of death were somehow eased as a result of the second chance they have had for life through the transplant experience. \"I am no longer afraid of death. I have a peace about my mortality.\" \"Life is tenuous at best, but now I have an inner peace.\" Some of the negative aspects of QOL included inability to work due to needing frequent time off work for doctors' appointments and employers' fears the transplant recipient might become emergently ill while at work and incur some sort of legal liability for the employer. Several discussed limitations in functioning due to fatigue though energy levels were still improved from the pre -transplant phase. \"My well of energy is gone.\" \"I have a sort of transient tiredness. But if I rest for just fifteen minutes or so, it will pass.\" \"I need more rest now, but I'm willing to persist. When I was sick, I just didn't have the energy to try.\" Many also noted problems with memory and processing thoughts. A few of the recipients talked about living with the knowledge th ey may reject their transplanted liver at any time and require another transplant. These informants stated this was not an overpowering fear, but it was present in their mind and a part of their reality now. One participant stated she worries about havin g to live with a decreased QOL from limitations that might occur in the future as a result of the transplant. \"I appreciate life, but don't know if I can live with any other limitations.\" Many participants talked of the financial implications associated with paying for their transplantation. \"This (liver transplant) hit us like a ton of bricks because we had been saving for retirement. We didn't know if our insurance would cover it.\" \"I was told I 118 needed $50,000 up front. I had cholangiocarcinoma and my i nsurance company wouldn't cover transplantation for that type of cancer. . . it would take us three or four months to fight the insurer and we didn't have that kind of time. . . we needed $100,000 more to do the transplant. It's $150,000 to even start. . . so we started liquidating stuff. Everywhere we had it. The kids' CDs, our CDs, everything we had. Mother had to move money from places that she had. My sister -in-law had money in places and she had to liquidate them. . . We got $97,000 together. . . can I come and just deposit that? No, it has to be the whole amount . . . I knew that time was getting short.\" One informant discussed his struggle with not being able to work anymore: \"I can't work, so where do I fit into society? What is my value?\" He eventu ally decided to install candy machines at various sites throughout his community to raise money for the transplant program. \"This has really helped me regain a sense of having a work routine. The machines have to be serviced on schedule.\" One informant wh o had an extremely difficult first year post -transplant due to medication side effects (depression, anxiety attacks, low self -esteem, memory loss) stated, \"It was a horrible experience, but I would do it again.\" Others echoed her sentiment \u2014they would do it all over again. \"If you have to have it (liver transplant), don't hesitate.\" \"I am a whole person again. You'll get your life back.\" These informants provide insight regarding their post -transplant experiences related to QOL. Clearly, the data provided f rom this pilot support Ferrans and Power's conceptualization of QOL. Family and health were cited most frequently as being important to these informants' QOL. Physiologic, psychological, social, and spiritual 119 aspects of QOL were mentioned. Many informants also discussed the socioeconomic aspects of their QOL related to the financial burden of transplantation. The need to connect with God, other transplant recipients, and family members reflect characteristics of ST and support the thesis ST is related to QO L in this patient population. Fatigue, a variable known to impact QOL and theorized as having an impact on ST, was also mentioned by informants in this study. This pilot was helpful in aiding the researcher to select an appropriate QOL measure for the liv er transplant population. Tools used to evaluate QOL are numerous and tend to focus on either specific or general aspects of the QOL domains (Spilker, 1996). These informants suggest physiologic, psychological, social, spiritual, family, and socioeconomic aspects of QOL are important to this patient population. Insight into the QOL experiences of these informants offers understanding regarding the illness distress associated with liver transplantation. Findings from the study support the current investigat ion as being relevant and important in helping nurses understand how to support and promote QOL in liver transplant recipients. Data Analysis Data were analyzed using SPSS for Windows 10.0.7 for all research questions with the exception of Question 4. SAS for Windows was used to analyze Question 4. No missing data were replaced prior to data analysis for the Quality of Life Index (QLI) scale since scoring for this tool takes missing data into consideration. For the remaining scales, missing data were replac ed using the series mean. For the total data set, replacement of missing data for the Self -Transcendence Scale (STS) was 0.9%, for the Illness Distress 120 Scale (IDS) was 1.2%, and for the Fatigue Scale (FS) was 0.5% of the total data set. Data were not repla ced for respondents who were missing 20% or more of scores for a tool. After all data sets were cleaned, histograms were conducted to assess for normality, skewness, and kurtosis. Self -transcendence scores and FS scores depicted a nearly normal curve. Th e QLI scores appeared negatively skewed, but are deemed acceptable since the mean and SD are consistent with previously published results (Hicks et al., 1992; LoBiondo -Wood et al., 1997). The illness distress scores appeared to be positively skewed. Only one study was found in the literature for comparison of score results (Noyes et al., 1990). Illness distress score ranges were similar to those in the current study as were mean scores. Skewness of asymmetry was also assessed using Pearson's skewness coef ficient (Munro, 2001). Skewness coefficients were determined to be within acceptable ranges for the STS scores and FS scores (ST = .10, FS = .03) since values fall between .2 or -.2 (Munro). Because QLI (.27) and IDS ( -.31) scores were found to be slightly skewed, kurtosis was expected and therefore not assessed. Fisher's measure of kurtosis for the STS scores (.88) suggested normality; however mild kurtosis was noted for the FS scores (-3.8). Typically a score above 2 or below -2 suggests non -normality (S PSS, 1999). All four key variables demonstrated a linear relationship based on probability plots. Frequencies, means, and standard deviations were computed to obtain a profile of the sample on demographic and QOL -related variables. Pearson correlations als o were computed between key concepts of the model and selected demographic variables to determine whether predicted relationships were significant at the 0.05 level and to check 121 for multicollinearity among the variables. According to Munro (2001), problems with multicollinearity occur when correlations are high (>0.85). Correlations ranged from - 0.20 to -0.71 for the key variables and from -.04 to -.83 for selected demographic variables indicating low to moderate multicollinearity. Tolerance values were al so run to assess multicollinearity prior to regression analysis. According to Hays (1994), a tolerance value close to 1.00 means it is safe to include a variable in a regression model while a value close to 0.00 indicates the risk for multicollinearity. T olerance values for the step -wise regression model ranged from 0.67 to 0.99. For comparison, cohorts were grouped according to time -since-transplantation. A review of the liver transplant literature and discussion with a colleague in the specialty (S. Cha ppell Rugari, personal communication, March 23, 2001) suggests natural groupings for time since transplantation based on similarities in life experiences regarding liver transplant survivorship usually occur at < two years (Group 1), three to five years (G roup 2), six to ten years (Group 3), and > ten years (group 4). Protection of Human Subjects Prior to any data collection, approval to conduct the study was obtained from four institutions: The University of Texas at Austin (Appendix F), Baylor Universit y Medical Center (Appendix G), Washington University Medical Center (Appendix H), and the University of Texas at Arlington (student's employer) (Appendix I). Privacy of all potential participants was protected initially by having introductory letters maile d from each referral agency so that the potential respondents were unknown to the researcher. 122 Potential respondents became known to the researcher only when a letter was returned to the researcher indicating the liver transplant recipient's interest in pa rticipating in the study. Signed consent was obtained from each participant and another original is maintained in the researcher's files. Confidentiality of participant data was protected by assigning code numbers to each participant for use with all study forms. All research data are being stored under double lock and key. 123 CHAPTER FOUR PRESENTATION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA This chapter contains demographic information describing the sample, analysis of data, and findings related to each of the six research questions. Themes identified in the qualitative data are also presented. Description of the sample Table 6 (p. 124) summarizes the demographic data obtained from study participants (n = 471). The age range for the sample (n = 470) ranged f rom 19 years to 79 years of age ( M = 56.33, SD = 10.75). The sample was fairly equally divided on gender (53.5% male, 46.5% female) and well educated with over 97% individuals attaining at least a high school diploma. A majority of the sample were Caucasi an (85.6%) married (73.5%), and reported a religious affiliation (93.4%). Table 7 (p. 126) lists health -related demographics. Most respondents perceived their health status as \"good\" (48%) or \"excellent\" (19%) and almost half (46.9%) had received their li ver transplant within the past one to five years. At the time of transplantation, the majority of participants (67%) were residing at home. The primary medical diagnoses leading to transplantation for this sample was Hepatitis C followed by cirrhosis. One half of participants have participated in a transplant support group and 18% of the respondents were currently participating in a support group. The means and standard deviations for the study instruments are reported in Table 8 (p. 127). 124 Table 6 Demogra phic Statistics for Sample (n = 457 to 470) Variable Frequency Percent Gender (n = 469) Male Female 252 217 53.5 46.1 Ethnicity (n = 465) African American American Indian Asian/Pacific Islander Caucasian Hispanic Other Missing 17 8 5 403 25 7 6 3.6 1.7 1.1 85.6 5.3 1.5 1.3 Highest educational level (n = 470) Elementary school 4 0.8 Junior high 6 1.3 High school 153 32.5 Technical/vocational 44 9.3 College 195 41.4 Post-graduate 68 14.4 Missing 1 0.2 Marital status (n = 457) Never married 28 5.9 Married 346 73.5 Separated 3 0.6 Divorced 53 11.3 Widowed 23 4.9 Living with a partne r 4 0.8 Missing 14 3.0 Religious affiliation (n = 464) None 24 5.1 Catholic 79 16.8 Jewish 3 0.6 Protestant 315 66.9 Other 43 9.1 Missing 7 1. 5 125 Table 6 (continued).

What is the difference in STS scores among time -since-transplant cohorts a) relative to gender? and b) controlling for the effect of age (young [19 -45 years], middle [46 -64], and older [65 -79] adult)? For comparison, cohorts were grouped according to time -since-transplantation. A review of the liver transplant literature and discussion with a colleague in the specialty (S. Chappell Rugari, personal communication, March 23, 2001) suggests natural groupings for time since transplantation based on similarities in life experiences regarding liver transplant survivorship usually occur at < two years (Group 1), three to five years (Group 2), six to ten years (Group 3), and > ten years (Group 4). Frequencies and percentages for time -since-transplant cohorts are reported in Table 9 (p. 129). Differences between gender and time -since-transplant c ohorts on STS scores were calculated using the analysis of variance (2 x 4 ANOVA) statistic after assuring the assumptions for ANOVA were met (mutually exclusive independent variables and normal distribution for dependent variable). While group homogeneity of variance (required assumption for ANOVA) was not found for gender groups, the ANOVA statistic is known to be robust, particularly for large sample sizes, and was deemed suitable for the current analysis. The risk of a Type II error, however, is increas ed in the absence of homogeneity of variance (Munro, 2001). No significant interaction effect was found between gender and the time -since- transplant cohorts. A significant difference in STS scores, however, was noted between gender groups for the total sam ple (F = 10.38, df = 1, p < .001) with females having higher STS scores than males (see Table 4, p 62. ). An eta -squared statistic of 0.02 129 Table 9 Mean STS Scores for Time -since -transplant and Gender Cohorts (n = 467) Gender Time-since-transplant group N Mean SD Male Group 1 ( < 2 years) Group 2 (3 -5 years) Group 3 (6 -10 years) Group 4 (> 10 years) Total 35 76 93 47 251 3.41 3.30 3.31 3.26 3.31 .34 .42 .38 .38 .39 Female Group 1 ( < 2 years) Group 2 (3 -5 years) Group 3 (6 -10 years) Group 4 (> 10 years) Total 23 57 73 64 217 3.53 3.47 3.36 3.39 3.41 .33 .37 .38 .35 .37 130 suggests a small effect size (Cohen, 1988) for the statistical differences between STS scores and gender. Because the required assumption of group homogeneity of variance for ANOVA was not met for the gender groups (p = .03), a t -test for unequal variances was used to verify the significance of results. The significant difference between STS scores for gender was supported (t = -3.14, p = .002). Differences between time -since-transplant cohorts on STS scores for gender controlling for the effect of age were not analyzed as planned using the ANCOVA statistic since there was no significant relationship between the covariate (age) and the dependent variable (STS scores). Munro (2001) sugges ts the use of a complex ANOVA in this situation, with the levels of the covariate (age) being used as another independent variable; therefore, the three age cohorts were treated as an independent variable along with gender and time -since transplantation co horts. Results of this (2 x 3 x 4) ANOVA analysis found no significant interaction effect between the groups (p = .85). Research Question 2. What is the difference in QLI scores among the time -since- transplant cohorts a) relative to gender? b) controlling for the effect of age ( young [19 -45 years], middle [46 -64], and -79] adult)? After verifying the assumptions for ANOVA were met (mutually exclusive independent variables, normal distribution for dependent variable, and homogeneity of variance ac ross groups), differences between time -since-transplant cohorts on QLI scores according to gender were analyzed using the (2 x 4) ANOVA statistic. No significant gender differences were found in QLI scores. 131 Differences in QLI scores among time -since-transp lant cohorts by gender groups controlling for the effect of age were not analyzed utilizing ANCOVA since there was no significa nt relationship between gender and age (? = .04, p = .26). Analysis of differences in QLI scores between gender, age, and time -since-transplant cohorts using a complex (2 x 3 x 4) ANOVA (Munro, 2001) found no significant differences between any of the gro ups. Research Question 3. What is the relationship among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores within the total sample and time -since-transplant cohorts? The Pearson product moment correlation statistic (r) was used to determine the relationships among the QLI, ST S, IDS, and FS scores for the total sample as well as within each of the time -since-transplant cohorts. All relationships among the four key variables were statistically significant at the .01 level of significance (2 -tailed) for the total sample (see Tabl e 10, p. 132). Cohen (1987) defines a small effect size as a correlation coefficient of r = 0.1, a moderate effect as r = 0.3, and a strong effect as r = 0.5. Strong positive relationships were observed between quality of life and self -transcendence (r = .51, p < .01) as well as illness distress and fatigue (r = .51, p < .01). A strong negative relationship was found for quality of life and illness distress (r = -.71, p < .01). A moderate negative correlation was observed between QOL and fatigue (r = -.45, p < .01) and ST and illness distress (r = -.36, p < .01). A weak negative correlation was observed between ST and fatigue (r = -.20, p < .01). Relationships among the variables of interest within the time -since-132 Table 10 Relationships (Pearson's r ) Between Scores on Quality of Life Index, Self -transcendence Scale, Illness Distress Scale, and Fatigue Scale for Total Sample (n = 471) QLI STS IDS .01 ( 2-tailed) 133 transplant cohorts were statistically significant with few exceptions and followed a similar pattern (see Table 11, p. 134). In general, the relationships were weakest in the cohort that was > 10 years since transplantation. The relationships between demographic variables and the four main variables were also examined. Bivariate correlations were used to analyze relationships for interval level demographic variables (Table 12, p. 135). A weak positive relationship was noted between age and QLI scores (r = .10, p = .03) indicating QLI scores increased as age increased. A weak negative relationship was also noted between time -since-transplant in years and STS scores (r = -.11, p < .05). STS scores were higher for those most recently transplanted. The Kendall' s tau statistic was used to analyze relationships for nominal and ordinal level demographic variables and the four main variables (Table 12, p. 135). Being married was associated with higher QLI scores (r = .10, p < .01) and lower illness distress scores (r = -.11, p < .01). Higher levels of education were associated with lower illness distress (r = -.10, p < 01) and fatigue scores (r = -.10, p < .01). As expected, positive health status was associated with higher QLI (r = .53, p < .01) an d STS scores (r = .29, p < .01) and lower illness distress (r = -.52, p < .01) and fatigue scores (r = -.35, p < .01). Employment status was associated with higher QOL (r = .23, p < .01) and ST scores (r = .11, p < .01) and lower illness distress (r = -.34, p < .01) and fatigue scale scores (r = -.23, p < .01). Relationships between the demographic variables were also explored (Table13, p.136). In this sample, males were more likely to be married (r = -.19, p < .01), educated 134 Table 11 Relations hips (Pearson's r) Between Scores on Quality of Life Index, Self -transcendence Scale, Illness Distress Scale, and Fatigue Scale for Time -since -transplant Cohorts (n = 471) QLI STS IDS FS Group 1 (> 2 years) (n = 58) QLI 1.00 -tailed) 135 Table 12 Relationships (Pearson's r & Kendall's tau) Between Key Vari ables and Select Demographic Variables (n = 471) Scale scores Demographic variable QLI STS IDS FS Pearson's Actual married = \"1\" Educational level4: none = \"1\", elementary school = \"2\", junior high = \"3\", high school = \"4\", technical/vocational = \"5\", college = post -graduate Health status5: poor = \"1\", fair = \"2\", good = \"3\", excellent = \"4\" Support group participation6: no = \"0\", yes = \"1\" yes = \"1\" *p < .05, **p < .01 136 Table 13 Relationships (Kendall's tau) Between Select Demographic Variables (n = 471) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1.

Support group participation was weakly associated with higher levels of education (r = .11, p < .05). Being employed was moderately associated with a higher self -rated health status (r = .39, p < .01). Research Question 4 . What is t he difference in the relationships among STS, QLI, IDS, and FS scores within the time -since-transplant cohorts? Table 14 (p. 138) displays significant differences calculated using the Fisher's z statistic in the relationships among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS s cores within the time -since- transplant cohorts. Only two pairs of correlations in the Group 1 time -since-transplant cohort differ significantly from the correlations observed in the other time -since- transplant cohorts. The correlation between QLI scores an d IDS scores in Group 1 (r = -0.61) was significantly different (z = 3.00, p = .002) than the correlations in Group 3 (r = -0.83). The relationship between STS and IDS scores in Group 1 (r = -0.55) is significantly greater (z = -2.39, p = .02) than the r elationship in Group 4 (r = -0.21). Two pairs of correlations also differed significantly between Groups 2 and 3 when compared to the other time -since-transplant cohorts. The relationship between STS and FS scores in Group 2 (r = -.06) is significantly we aker (z = 3.00, p = .002) than the relationship in Group 3 (r = -0.39). Significantly different correlations (z = -2.7, p =.006) were also noted for QLI and IDS scores between Group 2 (r = - 0.75) and Group 3 (- 0.55). Finally, three pairs of correlatio ns differed significantly between Groups 3 and 4 when compared to the other time -since-transplant cohorts. The relationship between QLI and IDS scores in Group 3 (r = -.83) was significantly stronger (z = -4.5, p = .00001) 138 Table 14 Significant Differenc es in Relationships (Fisher's z) Among Quality of Life Index Scores, Self-transcendence Scores, Illness Distress Scores, and Fatigue Scores Within the Time - Since -Transplant Cohorts Scales Correlation coefficient (r) Z score p- value Group 1 (< 2 year s-) (n = 58) Group 3 (6 -10 years) (n = 167) QLI &IDS -0.61 -0.83 3.00 .002 Group 1 (< 2 years) (n = 58) Group 4 (>10 years) (n = 111) STS & IDS -0.55 -0.21 -2.39 .02 Group 2 (3 -5 years) (n = 133) Group 3 (6 -10 years) (n = 167) STS & FS -0.06 -0.39 3.00 .003 QLI &IDS -0.75 -0.55 -2.70 .007 Group 3 (6 -10 years) (n = 167) Group 4 (>10 years) (n = 111) QLI & FS -0.39 -0.06 -2.87 .004 139 than the relationship in Group 4 (r = -.55). The relationship between QLI and FS scores in Group 3 (r = -.055) is significantly stronger than the relationship in Group 4 (r = - 0.36). Finally, significant differences (z = -2.87, p = .004) were also noted for STS and FS scores between Group 3 (r = - 0.39) and Group 4 (r = - 0.06). Research Question 5. What are the significant predictors for QLI scores accounted for by STS scores, IDS scores, FS scores, gender, age, and time -since- transplant? After verifying the assumptions for regression were met (normal distributions, equal variance across groups, linear relationships), step -wise regression was used to analyze the predictive relationship of the independent variables (STS, IDS, and FS scores; age, gender, and time -since-transplantation) on the dependent variable (QLI scores). According to Polit (1996), step -wise regression is appropriate for exploratory work. Factors were entered into the model if F < .05 and removed if F > 0.10. Four steps were generated by stepwise regression. In the initial step, IDS scores entered the equation and accounted for 51% of the variance in QLI (R = .71). In the second step, STS scores contributed an additional 7 % of the variance (R = .76) and in the third step, FS scores contributed an additional 1% (R = .77). I n the final model, IDS scores, STS scores, FS scores, and age accounted for 60% of the variance (R = .77) in QLI scores (Table 15, p. 140). Having less illness distress, a higher level of self - transcendence, less fatigue, and being older were associated wi th greater quality of life. 140 Table 15 Summary of Step -wise Regression Model for Variables Predicting Liver Transplant Recipients' Qualify of Life (n = 468) Model R R Square Adjusted R Square Standard Error B SE B Beta Stand.

What factors and experiences do participants identify as affecting their ST and QOL during the transplant survivor experience? A qualitative descriptive approach as described by S andelowski (2000) was used to analyze all qualitative data for themes and categories of data that emerged from the informants' personal experiences of liver transplantation. Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were utilized to summarize th ese categories and themes. Question 6a. Since receiving the transplant, how does your quality of life (QOL) compare now to what you expected your quality of life to be after receiving your new organ? Three hundred eighty four informants (81.5%) responded to this question. Most informants (n = 173, 45%) indicated their QOL was better than what they had anticipated their QOL would be. One informant indicated, \"I do everything and anything I want to do.\" Another commented, \"After I got my transplant. . . I thought life was over. Boy, was I wrong!\" Some informants indicated prior to transplantation, they were facing death. With a successful transplant, their QOL was improved simply because they had been given life again. For example, one informant wrote, \"I t is not that bad. You may not do all you would like, but you have life!\" Another commented, \"It is extremely better. Before the transplant, I was to the point of not having a life. I was at the point of planning for death.\" Many informants who indicated their QOL had improved also mentioned comorbidities that have prevented them from having even better QOL. These comorbidities included kidney failure, weak muscles, diverticulitis, fatigue, back pain, 142 diabetes, arthritis, decreased sexual drive, aches and pains, an amputated leg, blood problems, hip replacement, age, limited vision and mobility, and Hepatitis C. Some informants indicated they have been totally surprised by the improvement in their QOL. Phrases such as \"I never expected \" described unexpect ed outcomes such as leading a normal life, being active, and feeling great. One informant wrote: \"My actual quality of life is higher than I expected. I never thought I'd feel so completely normal!\" Another stated: I expected to be an ill person, but my life is contrary to that. We have three children, one of which we adopted since the transplant, and I keep up with them very well. I work as a hairdresser at my beauty shop, teach the youth at our church, and do any activity I want. My husband and I to ok the youth to camp last week and I think I was more energetic than him. My life is great! Almost 20% of informants (n = 76) felt their QOL was worse than what they expected. Like those in the previous group, comorbidities were mentioned frequently (musc le loss, Hepatitis C, osteoporosis, kidney failure, memory loss, cerebral hemorrhage, neuropathy, cancer, fibromyalgia, Hepatitis B, weight gain, lung fungus, heart and vascular problems, bowel disturbances, infection, joint pain). Unlike the previous grou p, however, these comorbidities were not seen as an expected part of the transplant experience and these unexpected factors seemed to contribute to their experience of decreased QOL. For example, one informant wrote, My QOL is very different than what I expected. I expected to return to work and to a life close to what I had before. I keep coming down with infections and bowel 143 problems. HCV is now eating up my liver. I have been fighting toxoplasmosis for almost one year. One noticeable complaint for the group whose QOL is not what they expected is the struggle these individuals experience related to their post -transplant medications. Medication side effects such as weight gain, osteoporosis, kidney failure, neuropathy, pain, and financial expense see med to greatly affect post -transplant QOL. Examples of comments from informants include: \"Side effects caused by the medications I take on a daily basis have caused me much misery.\" Another wrote, \"I did not realize the amount of backlash that I was going to receive with continued use of medication. It has been more difficult than I had expected.\" Other informants commented they were not prepared about what to expect regarding life after transplantation: \"I thought it would be easier.\" Another stated, \"I d id not realize the adjustments I had to make.\" Many in this group suggested more information should be provided to patients prior to transplantation. One respondent noted, \"I am very disappointed in my quality of life. No one told me about the horrendous pain associated with a liver transplant and its aftermath!\" Someone else said, \"My quality of life is somewhat below expectation, only because of not being informed enough about the complications due to immunosuppression.\" Yet another informant wrote, \"I thought I would be able to return to work and support my family and provide for my wife as I have in the past. It didn't work out that way.\" Several were frustrated their post -transplant outcomes were not what had been predicted by the transplant team. Lack of energy and strength was also an important theme for the group who 144 indicated their QOL did not meet their expectations. Informants used descriptors such as \"lack of energy,\" \"tired,\" \"fatigued,\" and weak. One man wrote: \" Some mornings I feel very t ired at the beginning of the day without having done any work.\" Another said, \"Well, I am tired all the time. I sleep almost all day. I have no energy at all.\" Yet another stated, \"I was so active and full of energy before I got sick. I was hoping to be t he same way afterwards.\" A small group (n = 22, 5.7%) indicated their QOL was the same as prior to transplantation. These participants felt they had minimal interruption to their normal lifestyle and were satisfied with their post -transplant QOL. One of the participants wrote: \"My quality of life is excellent. I always expected my transplant to provide excellent health.\" Another said, I expected no change in my quality of life since the transplant and there has not been any. I am still the same happy, c arefree person I was before the transplant. I don't take myself or life too seriously. My quality of life now is good just like it was before my transplant. Over 16% of participating informants (n = 64) indicated they could not answer the question becaus e they did not have any expectations of QOL prior to transplantation. For some, transplantation occurred quickly and there was not much time to thing about how their life might be affected. Others just did not know what to expect. Several indicated they di d not think about life after transplantation, but simply focused on survival. Another 12.7% of informants (n = 49) did not evaluate their QOL against their pretransplant expectations, but many of these wrote comments indicating their QOL was 145 good. These co mments included, \"I'm guessing the quality of my life is fine. I seem to feel healthy and feel I have enough energy\" and \"My quality of life is good. I have no complaints because it could very well be worse than what it is.\" Question 6b. Do you feel you h ave had adequate resources to meet your financial needs related to your transplant? Three hundred eighty six respondents (77.7%) answered this question. The majority of informants (n = 263, 68.1%) felt they had adequate resources for financial needs relat ed to their transplant. Adequate insurance coverage was often credited for the ability to meet financial needs. Two informants stated they were financially secure independent of insurance due to self -employment. Over 17% (n = 67), however, felt they did no t have adequate resources to meet financial needs. Often, the lack of financial resources required people to make adjustments in their usual lifestyle. Stress and worry were often mentioned regarding lack of finances. For example, one woman wrote: \"I do h ave Medicare which has helped a lot, but for years we were constantly stressed over bills. Our dream was to retire and travel, but my husband has taken another job just to catch up with bills.\" Often the cost of the transplant was not the cause of worry, b ut the after -effects of transplantation such as maintaining a job or paying for follow -up care and medications. One informant wrote, I was cut off from my SSI and Medicaid in January. This has put a great financial burden on me. In fact, finances, findin g a job, finding a job with insurance, paying my bills, having food, keeping my clothes clean and having money to look for a job consumes my thoughts. High stress, not to mention how will I pay for my 146 medical tests and visits and what if I get sick with e ven a minor illness? How will I pay that? Over 14% of respondents (n = 56) said they had \"somewhat\" adequate resources, but they often have paid out -of-pocket for medical expenses related to the transplant. One woman indicated her out -of-pocket monthly ex penses were $1,400, yet her family made too much money to qualify for government assistance with medical expenses. Like the group who stated they did not have adequate resources, informants with \"somewhat\" adequate resources also commented about their conc erns of meeting financial needs in the future if they lost their job or insurance coverage, had to rely on government assistance, or had other medical needs. One informant explained, I am concerned about continual changes in our insurance plan where I wor k. I am also concerned about exceeding my maximum benefits (because of the cost of the transplant drugs). I also worry about what will happen with my insurance if I had to have another transplant \u2014would it pay for it? Question 6c. What is important to you r ight now in your life? Because the respondents (n = 394) listed multiple factors important in their life and in the interest of time, only the first factor listed was tallied for this analysis. Many informants (n = 186, 47.2%) indicated their family and f riends were most important in their life. Personal health was listed as most important to 22.8% (n = 90) of informants. Spirituality was also mentioned as an important life factor for 11.6% (n = 46) of respondents. Respondents mentioned such things as the ir faith in God, increased relationship with God, or growing spiritually. Other themes included living a productive 147 life and making a difference (n = 28, 7.1%) (e.g. \"helping others,\" \"achieving goals and dreams\"), experiencing happiness and enjoying life (n = 24, 6%) (eg. \"living life to the fullest\"), and obtaining a job or financial security (n = 20, 5%). Question 6d. Describe any experience of personal growth you have noted as a result of your transplant and recovery experience. Three -hundred -eight in formants (65.4%) responded to this question. Seven themes were identified from the informants' responses Over 25% (n = 79) stated as a result of their transplant, they experienced personal changes such as setting different life priorities and having greate r awareness of the \"details\" in life. One person wrote: \"I don't take things for granted anymore and I realize how much people appreciate me.\" Another said, \"I now have a different look on life.\" Another personal growth theme identified by informants was s piritual growth (n = 66, 21.4%). Respondents wrote comments such as: \"I've grown closer to God and my church;\" \"My faith in God is stronger;\" \"I now believe in a higher power;\" and, \"I grew closer to Him during that time and He gave me peace.\" Other infor mants (n = 63, 20.4%) expressed an increased appreciation for life as a result of their transplant experience. Respondents frequently mentioned they no longer took life for granted and valued each day more than ever before. A change in priority was noted by some informants (n = 39, 12.5%), with work often being less important than before transplantation and time with family and friends more important. One individual wrote, \"Things that were very important to me before became not so important.\" 148 Another them e identified by 9.4% of informants (n = 29) was helping others and giving back to society. In particular, many in this group commented on their active participation in transplant support groups and raising awareness of the needs for organ donation. Infor mants (n = 21, 6.8%) also mentioned they have become more tolerant and caring towards others since their transplant experience. \"Empathy,\" \"respect,\" and \"understanding\" were words frequently used to describe attitudes towards others. Finally, family app reciation (n = 18, 5.8%) was a theme that emerged from the data regarding areas of personal growth since transplantation. Participants talked of how a spouse or child was particularly supportive. Others talked of their love for family. One woman wrote: \"I discovered what a wonderful family I have. I always loved them. Now, I treasure them.\" Another man wrote, \"I feel I have become a better husband and father.\" Question 6e. Is there anything else you would like to tell me about your transplant experience? Four main themes emerged from the informants' (n = 316, 67.1%) responses to this question. First, most respondents shared they had a good experience or learned from their experience (n = 126, 40.1%). \"Of course I would have preferred not to have needed one. But many new friends and great experiences entered my life as a result of having it. All in all, I think I am a better person.\" Many informants expressed gratefulness to the transplant team and their donor and donor families (n = 107, 33.8%). Some inf ormants commented on negative experiences (21.2%) associated with transplantation. Physical comorbidities, healthcare management issues, and personal 149 changes were mentioned most often: \"It was a very painful and difficult experience.\" Survivor guilt was al so frequently mentioned: Guilt\u2014so many others waited so long and I only waited 9 -10 days for my transplant. They suffered so long. I did not. I only had 9 -10 hours to live; I was in a coma. But there will always be some guilt. Additional analyses Optimi sm vs. pessimism. During analysis of qualitative information, it was very obvious some respondents had a very optimistic attitude while others had a more pessimistic attitude. Many respondents described the negative aspects of post - transplantation; some ho wever were very positive in their perspectives and comments while others were very cynical. For both those who felt their QOL was better and those who felt it was worse, comorbidities were often listed as having a major impact on post - transplant QOL. When those respondents who mentioned comorbidities were divided subjectively by the researcher into groups according to those who conveyed a more optimistic (n = 123) vs. pessimistic (n = 66) view of their QOL, significant differences (t = 5.00, p < .0001) wer e noted between groups. Mean QLI scores for the optimistic group were 25.20 vs. 20.54 for the pessimistic group. When differences between STS scores for these same groups (optimisms vs. pessimism) were analyzed, the optimistic group (n = 123, M = 3.45, SD = .36) had significantly higher STS scores (t = -3.03, p = .003) than the pessimistic group (n = 66, M = 3.28, SD .38). Correlations between the key variables and outlook (optimism vs. pessimism) revealed higher QLI (r = .39, p < .0001) and STS scores ( r = .216, p = .003) 150 and lower IDS (r = -.32, p < .0001) and FS scores (r = -.31, p < .0001) were in fact significantly related to an optimistic outlook. The question remains whether QOL affects optimism and pessimism or whether optimism/pessimism affects Q OL. Further research into the importance of attitude in the role of QOL would seem to be warranted. Summary of Findings Four-hundred -seventy -one individuals who had received a liver transplant participated in the study. The majority of participants were male (53.5%), Caucasian (85.6%), well educated (97.6%), married (73.5%), and religiously affiliated (93.6%). Almost one -half were working, either full (38.2%) or part time (7.9%). Hepatitis C was the leading cause of transplantation in the sample (25.5%). A majority (67.1%) ranked their current health status as either good or excellent. Statistically significant differences in STS scores were noted between gender cohorts with females reporting a higher score than males. QLI scores were not significantly d ifferent between gender and time -since-transplant cohorts. Statistically significant relationships for the total sample on all key variables (QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores) and selected demographic variables were present. Significant differences in the r elationships among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores within the time -since-transplant cohorts were varied. Several significant differences were noted between time -since-transplant cohorts for QLI and IDS scores as well as STS and IDS scores and STS and FS score s. Construction of a stepwise regression model revealed 60% of the variance in QLI scores was accounted for by IDS, STS, FS scores, and age (R = .77). 151 Analysis of qualitative responses revealed almost one half of informants indicated their QOL was bette r than what they had anticipated it to be after transplantation. Most felt they had adequate resources for financial needs related to their transplant. A majority indicated since transplantation, their family and friends were very important in their life. Over 25% of informants stated they experienced personal changes as a result of their transplant. Many respondents (40.1%) shared they had a good experience or learned from their transplant experience. Negative responses (21.2%) to transplantation were also reported, but were not as prevalent as positive experiences. 152 CHAPTER V SUMMARY, RECOMMENDATIONS, AND CONCLUSIONS This concluding chapter begins with a summary of the study. Discussion of findings, methodological issues, limitations, implications, and re commendations for future research are also addressed. Summary The primary purpose of this descriptive, correlational, comparative, cross - sectional study was to describe the relationship between QOL and ST in liver transplant recipients. The theoretical f ramework for the study proposes ST develops in the presence of a life crisis, such as liver transplantation, to facilitate a positive sense of life satisfaction and well -being reflected as the individual's level of QOL. A review of the literature suggested other factors such as illness distress, and fatigue along with demographics such as age, gender, marital status, education, and time -since-transplant were also relevant to QOL (Bryan et al., 1998; 1986; et al., 19 97; Reed, 1991b; Tarter et al., 1988), yet their relationship to QOL in liver transplant recipients had not been studied. In an effort to address this gap in knowledge, QOL, ST, illness distress, and fatigue were studied in cohorts grouped according to rel evant factors such as gender, age, and time -since-transplantation. T he following six research questions were addressed: Among liver transplant recipients: 1) What is the difference in ST scores among the time -since-transplant cohorts a) relative to gend er? b) controlling for the effect of age? 153 2) What is the difference in QOL scores among the time since transplant cohorts a) relative to gender? b) controlling for the effect of age? 3) What is the relationship among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores within th e total sample and time -since-transplant cohorts? 4) What is the difference in the relationships among QLI, STS, IDS, and FS scores within the time -since-transplant cohorts? 5) What are the significant predictors for QLI scores accounted for by STS score s, IDS scores, FS scores, gender, age, and time -since-transplant? 6) What factors and experiences do participants identify as affecting their ST and QOL during the transplant survivor experience? Discussion of Findings Demographic data. Four hundred seven ty one subjects participated in the study. According to Cohen (1988), a large sample size suggests a smaller error and greater reliability or precision of results resulting in increased statistical power. One additional benefit to the large sample size is that analysis of data within and among multiple cohorts was possible. Small relationships, however, will be significant (Knapp, 1998) and therefore the strength of the relationships will be important to consider when interpreting data from this study. The average age of subjects in this study was 56.33 years of age (range 19 -79 years), similar to national statistics. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data for 2000 (www.unos.org), most (41.6%) cadaveric liver transplant recipients we re between 50 -64 years of age. 154 Slightly more men (n = 252, 53.5%) than women participated in the study. The relatively equal numbers between gender groups was unexpected since the percentage of reported male to female liver transplants in the year 2000 wa s 61.6% (male) to 38.4% (female) (www.unos.org). While the relative equality of numbers between gender groups suggests a biased sample compared to national statistics, the equality between groups may actually serve to minimize the potential effects of gend er bias on the variables under study. Demographic findings for education, marital status, religious affiliation, and work status are similar to previous studies (Cameron -Duncan, 1993; Hicks et al., 1992; Lo-Biondo -Wood et al., 1997). Since it is known mi nority groups are greatly underrepresented in transplantation (Toledo -Pereyra, 1992), it was not surprising the majority of participants were Caucasian (85.6%). Several barriers to minority organ donation have been reported in the literature including dist rust of the medical community, a preference for donating to the same ethnic group, language barriers, and the desire for the entire extended family to agree on the decision regarding donation (Wheeler & Cheung, 1996). Ethnic comparison of this sample to UNOS statistics is difficult because of differences in UNOS reporting. In the current study, 25 Hispanics (5.3%) and 17 African Americans (3.6%) participated. While these cohorts are much smaller than the Caucasian cohort (n = 403, 85.6%), secondary analys is of data from these minority groups may offer some insight into their experiences from a cultural perspective. Additional investigation utilizing these two cohorts is planned with the existing data as well as further qualitative investigation. 155 Research question 1. This question addressed differences in STS scores between time-since-transplant cohorts relative to gender and controlling for the effect of age. Analysis of STS scores revealed this sample has a high level of ST (M = 3.36 on a scale of 1-4; S.D. = .37) consistent with findings from other patient populations (healthy adults [n = 146], M = 3.18, S.D. = .46 [Coward, 1996]; HIV positive adults [n = 46], M = 3.07, S.D. = .47 [Mellors, Riley, & Erlen, 1997]; oldest -old adults [n = 55], M = 3.3, SD = .48 [Reed, 1991]; and women with advanced breast cancer [n = 107], M = 3.35, SD = .36 [Coward, 1991]). Frankl (1967) suggests one way people come to make meaning out of life is through the stand they take when facing a \"fate\" they are powerless to chan ge (such as liver failure and the need for transplantation). This thesis may explain the consistently high STS scores in chronic populations. Frankl (1959) and Long (1999) propose suffering is an important aspect of transcendence. Those individuals with lo w STS scores may reflect those who have been unable to find meaning in their suffering experience. In this study, participants with the highest STS scores were female, older (65 -79 years old), or recently transplanted ( < 2 years). While STS scores were highest in older participants, the relationship between age and STS scores was non -significant. Reed (1991b) suggests ST is greater in persons facing end -of-own-life issues than in individuals not confronted with such issues . This may explain why those pa rticipants most recently dealing with transplantation and the reality of death have higher STS scores. These findings, however, contradict Baird's (1992) notion that ST develops as a new identity over time and would increase with age. Findings from the cur rent study 156 suggest over time, as life becomes \"normalized\" again for transplant recipients, end -of- life issues may diminish resulting in decreased STS scores. Additional exploration into the relationship between ST and age is indicated. Females reported a significantly higher STS score (F = 10.38, df = 1, p < .001) than males. Reed (1986) noted higher religiousness scores by elder females in her study of religion and terminal illness in terminally ill and healthy adults and reported similar findings by ot hers (Devine, 1980; Kivett, 1979). Decker (1993) suggests ST results in a personality reorder leading to greater harmony, altruism, resourcefulness, and integration in the individual. The high and relatively stable ST scores across time in this sample ma y also be a reflection of successful personality reorder in subjects as a result of spiritual development (independent of age or time) facilitated by the transplant experience. Research question 2. This question addressed differences in QLI scores betwee n time-since-transplant cohorts relative to gender and controlling for the effect of age. QLI scores in this sample were high (M = 23.72 on a scale of 0 -30) and similar to the findings of other QOL studies of liver transplant recipients (Cameron -Duncan, 19 93; Hicks et al., 1992; Lo -Biondo -Wood et al., 1997). Subjects with the highest QLI scores were female, older (65-79 years old), and received their transplant 3 -5 years ago. In a recent study of 757 adults from the general population of New South Wales, Au stralia, Kermode and MacLean (2001) also found higher QOL scores were associated with being female and increased age. 157 No significant differences in QLI scores were noted between cohorts on gender, time-since-transplantation, or age. These findings are sim ilar to previous studies (Andrykowski, Henslee, & Barnett, et al., 1992; Haberman et al., 1998, Levy et al., 1995). LoBiondo Wood and associates (1997) found non -significant differences in QLI scores (n = 41) over a shorter time period (3, 6, 12, and 18 months since transplant). Cameron -Duncan (1993) found no differences in total QLI scores related to gender (n = 165). Chappell (1999), using QOL data from an existing clinical database, did find men report ed significantly higher QOL than women (n = 139). The researcher expressed concern, however, that overlap between tools used to measure QOL in this database may have contributed to the significant findings (personal communication, December 2002). Further i nvestigation of gender differences related to QOL are warranted. Research addressing differences according to age in liver transplant recipients were not found in the literature. Kermode and MacLean (2001) did find significant increases in perceived QOL sc ores over time in their study of a general population (n = 757), but not in health related QOL or general happiness. Research question 3. As expected, all key variables (QLI, STS, IDS, and FS) were correlated. Strong relationships were noted between QOL and ST (r = .51, p < .01), illness distress and fatigue (r = .51, p < .01), and QOL and illness distress (r = -.71, p < .01). ST has been shown in studies of other groups to be positively associated with QOL (Hanna et al., 1995; Mellors et al., 1997; Y oung & Reed, 1991), but the relationship 158 had not been documented in the liver transplant population. Results from this study support the previous findings from other patient populations and suggest ST is a component of liver transplant recipients' QOL. The relationship between illness distress and fatigue is not well known. Because fatigue is one manifestation of illness distress and was addressed in the first item of the IDS, the single fatigue item was removed from the IDS, the IDS was again scored, and correlations were then reassessed. A moderate relationship (r = .49, p = < .0001) with illness distress was still present, suggesting fatigue is an independent factor highly correlated with illness distress. Illness distress is a global term that encompas ses distress caused by serious illness such as physical discomfort, bodily dysfunction, alteration in appearance, changes in social role, compromised interpersonal relationships, and threat of death (Noyes et al., 1990). While discussion in the literature regarding the relationship between illness distress and fatigue is essentially non -existent, Dean and Ferrell (1995) do suggest fatigue creates an awareness of severity of illness, a concept similar to illness distress. Desbiens, Mueller -Rizner, Connors, Wenger, and Lynn (1999) investigated another concept similar to illness distress known as symptom burden. Symptom burden encompasses one or more symptoms of at least moderate severity occurring at least half the time or symptoms of extreme severity of any frequency. In their study of 1582 seriously ill patients, \"fair\" (42.5%) or \"poor\" (19.9%) QOL was associated with high symptom burden (49.1%). 159 Cimprich (1999) offers examples of how symptom distress is related to illness distress. Cimprich suggests sympt oms are complex phenomena that reflect physical, mental or cognitive, or affective responses to illness and treatment. These responses may overlap or interact in a way that diminishes or worsens level of distress and adjustment. She suggests the emotional or affective distress associated with a life -threatening illness may increase the demands placed on cognitive resources, particularly attention, eventually leading to cognitive or attentional fatigue. This fatigue often results in reduced effectiveness in daily functioning that in turn contributes to an overall increased level of illness distress. The correlation in this study between QLI and IDS scores (r = .51, p < .01), would seem to support Cimprich's thesis. A moderate inverse relationship was found b etween QOL and fatigue (r = -.45, p < .01) as well as ST and illness distress (r = -.36, p < .01). Ferrell, Grant, Dean, Funk, and Ly (1996) proposed a theoretical model based on qualitative and quantitative data from patients with cancer whereby fatigu e impacts physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of QOL. These researchers stress fatigue is not an isolated symptom, but a force impacting all dimensions of QOL. The inverse relationship found in this study supports their thesis. Camarillo (1991) poses fatigue diminishes QOL by disrupting the patient's ability and desire to accomplish role functioning. While role functioning was not measured in the current study, only 21% of participants indicated they could not work for pay due to ill -health. Over 46% reported working, and employment was found to be negatively correlated with fatigue (r = -.14, p < .01). 160 Aaronson et al. (1999) discuss the challenges of defining and measuring fatigue. They posit various measures of fatigue actually tap in to different aspect or characteristics of fatigue. As a result, studies using different measures of fatigue may reach different conclusions, yet may be valid. These authors also point out response bias is also a key element in measuring a subjective phenom enon like fatigue. Expectations about how one should feel may be different than how one actually does feel. Aaronson and associates, therefore, suggest examining expectation discrepancies may be more fruitful than using absolute measures of fatigue. Furthe r investigation into the experience of fatigue in liver transplant recipients seems warranted, particularly focusing on measurement issues related to the fatigue experience. The inverse relationship between ST and illness distress (r = -.36, p < .01) may suggest as illness distress decreases, individuals are more successful in transcending their life experiences. Maslow (1971) theorized as basic needs are met (physiologic, safety, love), individuals can then turn their attention to higher needs (esteem and self- actualization). His theory could be used to explain this relationship. On the other hand, as an individual transcends their life experiences, perhaps their perception of illness distress is minimized. Reed suggests self -transcendence is a coping reso urce. Self -transcendence could be seen to facilitate effective coping with the illness distress associated with transplantation. Coward (1991) found ST decreased illness distress in 107 women with breast cancer through the mediating effect of emotional wel l-being. ST directly affected emotional well -being (\u00df = .69) and emotional well -being had a strong negative effect on 161 illness distress (\u00df = -.84). The direct path from ST to illness distress was non -significant (\u00df = .08) when statistically controlling for the effect of emotional well -being on illness distress. Further analysis of data in the current study utilizing structural modeling may yield more informative results supporting Coward's findings. Clearly, further research to more clearly delineate the rel ationship between ST and illness distress is warranted. A weak inverse relationship was found between STS and FS scores (r = -.20, p < .0001). The relationship between ST and fatigue was proposed by Coward (1990a, 1993), but had never been validated quan titatively. Joffrien & Douglas (1994) also suggested energy is required for ST to occur. The question is raised: D oes restoration of the individual's physical, mental, or spiritual energy increase ST? In addition to the relationship between fatigue and ST, the correlation (r = .28, p < .01) between health status and ST and health status and fatigue (r = -.35, p < .01) found in this study suggests this thesis may be true. Dean and Ferrell (1995) found in a study of cancer survivors, fatigue influenced spir itual well -being because it created an awareness of the severity of the illness and heightened feelings of uncertainty or hopelessness. Further investigation is needed to validate the importance of this relationship, particularly with attempts to discrimin ate between physical, mental, and spiritual fatigue. Correlations between key variables and QLI scores in time -since-transplant cohorts revealed some interesting trends. Correlations for the 6 -10 years -since- transplantation group were stronger for QLI and IDS, and QLI and FS scores than the other time -since-transplant cohorts. In fact, correlations between QLI and IDS scores increased over time (r = -.61 [< 2 years], -.83 [6 -10 years]) before 162 dropping significantly for the > 10 yea rs since -transplantation group (r = -.55) (p < .01 for all groups). This same trend was noted between QLI and FS scores over time (r = -.39 [< 2 years], -.36 [>10 years]). These trends suggest the relations hip between QOL and illness distress and fatigue strengthens over time with the strongest effect on subjects occurring during the 6 -10 years -since-transplant group before decreasing for the > 10 year cohort. One explanation for this trend may be the negat ive side effects of long term use of anti-rejection drugs begin to manifest during this period of time contributing to increased illness distress and fatigue. After 10 years, recipients may begin to adapt to the side effects and accommodate the associated illness distress and fatigue. This phenomena is known as response shift and is a common phenomena related to QOL issues for the chronically ill (Schwartz & Sendor, 1999). In fact, response shift has been suggested to be an explanation for counterintuitive findings in QOL research (Visser, Smets, Sprangers, & deHaes, 2000). The level of illness distress for the sample was relatively low (M = 15.3 on a scale of 0-100) as was the level of fatigue (M = 4.23 on a scale of 1 -10). Incidentally, no significant dif ferences were noted between gender, age, or time -since-transplant groups for IDS or FS scores. Other significant relationships for QOL had been previously reported in the literature (Bradbury & Catanzaro, 1989; Campbell et al., 1976; Tarter et al., 1988). Table 12 (p. 135) shows all significant relationships between key variables and select demographic variables in the current study. QOL was found to be related to age (r = .10, 163 p < .05), marital status (r = .10, p < .01), health status (r = .53, p < .01), and employment (r = .23, p < .01). Kermode and MacLean (2001) found higher QOL scores were associated with being female (t = 3.83, p < .0001), older (F = 3.8, p = .005), married, being retired, having positive self esteem, experiencing an absence of lon g term stress, and having healthy relationships with God and one's partners (actual values not reported). In a study of cancer (n = 72) vs. rehabilitation (n = 136) patients, Tate and Forchheimer (2002) found older subjects reported higher total QOL, life satisfaction, and spiritual well-being as did married subjects and those working. In studies specific to liver transplant recipients, LoBiondo -Wood et al. (1997) found income (r = .37, p < .01) and age (r = .43, p < .01) were significantly correlated with QOL. Cameron -Duncan (1993) (r = .18, p < .05), Gusick (1994) (r = .63, P < .002), and Hicks, Larson, and Ferrans (1992) (r = .39, p < .05) also found age and QOL were positively correlated. Leyendecker et al. (1993) found QOL was correlated with health (r = .69, p <.001) and exhaustion (r = -.37, p <.01). In this sample, ST was correlated with the demographic variables of gender (r = .11, p < .05), health status (r = .28, p < .01), employment (r = .11, p < .01), and time-since-transplantation (r = -.11, p < .05). Illness distress was correlated with marital status (r = -.11, p < .01), educational level (r = -.10, p < .01), health status (r = -.52, p < .01), and employment (r = -.25, p < .01). Fatigue was correlated with educational level (r = -.10, p < .01), health status (r = -.35, p < .01), and employment (r = -.14, p < .01). 164 Research question 4. Analysis of relationships between the variable scores within the time -since-transplant cohorts showed several statistically significant relation ships. QLI & IDS scores. Statistically significant relationships were noted for QLI and IDS scores between < 2 years and 6 to10 year time -since transplant cohorts (p = .002), the 3 to 5 year and > 10 year cohorts (p = .007), and the 6 to10 year and > 10 ye ar cohorts (p < .0001). QLI scores were relatively stable across time while an increase in IDS scores (indicating increased illness distress) was seen in the cohorts after 4 to 5 years. This subtle increase is not surprising giving the side effects associ ated with anti -rejection drugs that occur the longer these drugs are used. Interestingly however, IDS scores were lowest for the 3 to 5 year group (M = 14.65, SD 13.93) and highest for the 6 to 10 years -since-transplant group (M = 15,77, SD 13.68). This difference is somewhat puzzling. Perhaps recipients are experiencing increased health during the first five years after their transplant causing their illness distress scores to decrease. As the effects of anti -rejection medication after five years of con tinued use are manifested, however, disappointment and fear of returning comorbidities may cause subjects to rank their illness distress higher during the 6 to10 years -since-transplant time period. Gubby (1998) however, found the greatest number of transpl ant associated stressors occurred during the 1 to 5 years after transplantation and the lowest scores in the > 5 year group. Gubby's study was limited in sample size (n = 30) and was conducted in England, which may contribute to differences in findings bet ween the two studies. Additional study regarding the occurrence of illness distress in post -165 transplant liver recipients is warranted, particularly when considering time -since- transplantation. STS & IDS scores. Self-Transcendence Scale scores were significa ntly related to IDS scores between the < 2 year and > 10 year cohorts (p = .02). STS scores were highest for the < 2 years cohort (M = 3.46, SD .33), remaining stable across time after that time period. The higher STS score for the most recently transplant ed group is not surprising since it is expected individuals that have faced their mortality would have a heightened since of their spirituality, particularly when the confrontation with death is so recent (Reed, 1991b). The relationship between STS scores and IDS for the most recently transplanted group and the group fartherest out from transplantation may reflect subjects' heightened awareness of their spirituality. As previously stated, those just recovering from their transplant and having recently face d the possibility of death if the transplant were unsuccessful may be highly sensitized to their spirituality. In addition, heightened spirituality expressed as ST is known to exist for elder adults (Reed, 1986, 1987, 1991a, 1991b; Young & Reed, 1995). Tho se subjects in the group > 10 years -since- transplantation tended to also be the oldest subjects (rho = .15, p < .001). STS & FS scores. Self-transcendence scale scores were significantly related to FS scores between the 3 to 5 year and 6 to10 year cohorts (p = .003) and the 6 to10 year and > 10 year cohorts (p = .004). Differences between the STS scores according to time -since- transplant cohorts were previously discussed. STS scores were highest for the most recently transplanted group. 166 Fatigue scale scores were lowest for the < 2 years group, highest for the 3 to 5 year group, and decreasing thereafter for the remaining two cohorts. The extreme difference between the first two cohorts might be due to the fact steroid use is generally highest during the firs t few years following transplantation. The high doses of steroids may provide an added boost of energy for subjects. In addition, those who were chronically fatigued prior to transplantation may notice a significant increase in energy immediately following transplantation as compared to their pre -transplant state. If steroid use is decreased during the 3 to 5 year post -transplant period (typical practice), patients may have less of a masking effect of the fatigue associated with the higher steroid doses used initially after transplantation. After the 3 to 5 year period, the fatigue scores gradually decreases over time. This change may reflect lower steroid and anti -rejection drug utilization post -transplantation as the patient progresses. On the other hand, patients may adapt to their experience of fatigue over time and rank their level of fatigue as less than that experienced when the effects of decreasing steroid use (and subsequent less energy) were first recognized. Initially STS scores were highest and FS scores were lowest, but that relationship did not hold over time. As FS scores peaked (3 to 5 year group) and then decreased over time, STS score consistently decreased over time and stabilized. The strongest correlation between STS and FS scores occurr ed in the 6 to 10 year cohort (r = -.39, p < .01) while the weakest correlations were in the 3 to 5 year and >10 year cohorts. These trends are puzzling. 167 Significant relationships between health status and both variables (ST and FS) were noted (STS scores , r = .28, p < .01; FS scores, r = -.35, p < .01) as well as significant relationships between employment and STS scores (r = -.16, p < .01) and FS scores (r = -23, p < .01). Perhaps health status and employment somehow have an impact on the significan t ST and FS relationships between the time -since-transplant cohorts. Further investigation, including qualitative methodology, is needed to understand the meaning of these relationships. Research question 5. What are the significant predictors for QLI scor es accounted for by STS scores, IDS scores, FS scores, gender, age, and time -since-transplant? For this study, ST, illness distress, fatigue, age, and time -since transplant were theoretically conceptualized as important predictors of QOL. In fact, illness distress scores (R = .71; \u00df = -.55), STS scores (R = .76; \u00df = .29 ), FS scores (R = .77; \u00df = -.11), and age (R = .77; \u00df = .08 ) accounted for 60% of the variance in QLI scores using a step -wise regression model. Comparison of study findings with other pr edictive models is difficult since no regression models for QOL in liver transplant recipients were found in the literature. In this study, illness distress was the greatest predictor of QLI scores, explaining 50 -58% of the variance in QLI scores. Because there are few studies of illness distress reported in the literature, additional investigation into this important QOL factor is clearly indicated. STS scores explained 8 -9% of the variance in QLI scores in the current study. While no other studies were f ound addressing the contributions of ST to QOL, Cotton and associates (1999) performed a five -step hierarchical regression analysis of QOL in 168 142 women with invasive breast cancer and found a single measure of spirituality, spiritual well -being (\u00df = .29, p < .05), contributed only 3% of the total variance explained by the research model (R2 = .44). Beery, Baas, Fowler, and Allen (1992), however, found combined spirituality scores (religious well -being, existential well -being, and spiritual well-being) contr ibuted 24% of the variance in global QOL in 58 patients with heart failure being treated medically or by transplant. Their findings suggest diverse measures of different dimensions and reflections of spirituality may offer more understanding regarding the importance of spirituality to QOL outcomes. It has been argued at least one measure of spirituality should be included in all QOL evaluations (Beery et al.; Brady et al., 1999; Erickson, Tomlin, & Swain, 1983; Tuck, McCain, & Elswick, 2001). Further unders tanding of important components of spirituality such as ST are needed to adequately assess the contribution of spirituality to QOL. Research question 6. What factors and experiences do participants identify as affecting their ST and QOL during the transpla nt survivor experience? A majority of respondents (n = 173, 45%) indicated their post -transplant QOL was better than what they had anticipated. For some, just having life was enough to say their QOL was high. Others were totally surprised at how well they felt and how much they were able to do and enjoy. A smaller group of subjects (n = 76, 20%) felt their QOL was worse than what they expected. Interestingly for both those who felt their QOL was better and those who felt it was worse, comorbidities were o ften listed as having a major impact on post -transplant 169 QOL. When those respondents who mentioned comorbidities were divided subjectively by the investigator into groups according to those who conveyed a more optimistic (n = 123) vs. pessimistic (n = 66) view of their QOL, significant differences (z = -.48, p < .001) were noted between groups. Mean QLI scores for the optimistic group were 25.20 vs. 20.54 for the pessimistic group. These exploratory findings suggest attitude and QOL are related, though it is not understood whether QOL affects attitude or attitude affects QOL. Kermode and MacLean (2001) agree personality characteristics such as optimism do seem to play an important role in QOL. In their own research, they found positive self -esteem was rela ted to higher QOL. When differences between STS scores for these same groups (optimisms vs. pessimism) were analyzed, the optimistic group (n = 123, M = 3.45, SD = .36) had significantly higher STS scores (t = -3.03, .003) than the pessimistic group (n = 6 6, M = 3.28, SD .38). Attitude and ST, therefore, would appear to be related, though more investigation is needed to determine any cause and effect relationship. Correlations between the key variables and outlook (optimism vs. pessimism) revealed higher QLI (r = .39, p < .0001) and STS scores (r = .216, p = .003) and lower IDS (r = -.32, p < .0001) and FS scores (r = -.31, p <.0001) were in fact significantly related to an optimistic outlook. Further research into the importance of attitude in the role of QOL would seem to be warranted. Information regarding medication side effects and life after transplantation was a need voiced by subjects. Research has already shown the importance of providing accurate information to patients based on individual prefer ence in order to facilitate 170 positive patient outcomes (Chelf et al., 2002; Krohne, Slangen, & Kleemann, 1996; Mitchell, 2000). Participants clearly articulated the need for more adequate preparation regarding what to expect after transplantation. Financia l resources for the sample overall were reported to be adequate due to provisions of insurance coverage. Because average yearly income was not assessed, it is difficult to generalize these findings beyond the sample. Education level was high, suggesting fi nancial resources were probably also higher than for a less -educated sample. Subjects did voice concern regarding finances if they should lose insurance coverage. Others voiced changes in life plans (e.g. retirement) because of financial obligations relate d to transplantation. Few studies assessing post -transplant financial implications for liver transplant recipients have been published. Shireman, Martin, and Whiting (2001) studied patient transplant -related Medicare costs during the first year following s olid organ transplantation. They found the largest single component of transplant -related care was prescription medications, averaging $8228 per year. Inpatient hospitalizations were second, averaging $6121 for transplant -related events. Transplant mainten ance costs averaged over $17,700 per year. Medication costs were consistent and substantial across organ transplant types with 75% of those costs accounted for by immunosuppressive agents. While the Shireman et al. study did not account for non -Medicare ex penses, it does provide a realistic appraisal of the expense associated with post -transplant care. Subjects reported multiple factors important in their life including family and friends, health, spirituality, productivity, happiness, and job security. Th ese findings are similar to quantitative findings in the literature. Kermode and MacLean (2001) found 171 having good relationships with a partner, children, and God enhanced QOL and a high positive self -esteem contributed to the \"happiness\" dimension for OQL. Seiler et al. (1998) found improvement in QOL following liver transplantation was reflected in a parallel increase in the ability to work. Methodology issues One concern regarding the four measurement tools must be mentioned. For each of these tools, a c eiling or floor effect was noted. For the QLI, 1.7% of subjects (n = 8) selected the highest possible QOL score on all items. For the STS, 1.3% of subjects (n = 6) selected the highest possible ST score on all items. Quality of life and ST were ranked relatively high for the overall sample. Both IDS and FS were ranked low overall by the study sample. For the IDS, 3.6% of subjects (n = 17) selected the lowest possible score on all items and for the FS, 1.9% (n = 9) selected the lowest possible fatigue score on all items. Though affected percentages are small, these trends suggest the tools did not adequately capture the true range of experiences perceived by these subjects. Interestingly, Bufford, Paloutzian, & Ellison (1991) reported a ceiling effect with th e Spiritual Well -Being Scale when used in populations of very religious people (eg., monastics or clerics). This may explain the ceiling effect for the STS since over 93% of participants were religiously affiliated. No other reports, however, of ceiling o r floor effects with the study tools were reported in the reviewed literature, though the trend is evident. When compared to other groups, fatigue and illness distress scores were low for the sample and QLI and ST scores were high. 172 Limitations Several li mitations of the study must be carefully considered when interpreting the findings from this study. 1) The sample was predominantly Caucasian, highly educated, and religiously affiliated limiting the generalization of findings to more diverse populations. 2) The largest site providing subjects to the study is located in the Bible -belt and may have contributed to some bias in the high numbers of participants with religious affiliation and the overall high STS scores for this sample. 3) While every adult liv er transplant recipient who met the study criteria at the two participating sites was invited to participate, those who elected to participate may be different from non -participants (e.g. fatigued individuals may have elected to forego participation due to lack of energy). 4) Assessment of sample distributions revealed QLI scores were slightly negatively skewed and IDS scores were slightly positively skewed indicating some bias may have occurred in the sample distribution. 5) The large sample size increases the likelihood that a small effect size will be detected as statistically significant. 6) Cross -sectional study does not allow for measurement of variables across time in the same subjects, limiting cause and effect conclusions. 7) Volunteer responders ma y be different from non -responders. 8) Potential o verlap of some questions between the four measures used in the study may have contributed to inflation of correlations. 173 Implications for nursing Research findings (Daly, 1989) suggest nurses are unaware o f the empirical data supporting improved QOL for patients with successful liver transplantation compared to the patients' pre -transplant status. Results of the current study provide further evidence liver transplant recipients do experience high QOL follow ing transplantation and this experience of QOL persists across time. Nurses working with individuals considering liver transplantation can share scientific data regarding post -transplant QOL in order to help these individuals make informed decisions regard ing transplantation. Despite satisfactory and improved QOL, comorbidities are a major source of discontent for liver transplant recipients. Study participants frequently mentioned medication side effects such as kidney failure, weak muscles, diverticuliti s, fatigue, back diabetes, and arthritis as challenging and frustrating aspects of post -transplant life. Many participants expressed frustration they were not fully informed regarding what to expect after transplant. Nurses caring for pre -transplant patie nts should be honest and thorough in educating patients and families about the post -transplant experience, incorporating research data to prepare patients more accurately for post -transplant experiences. Emphasis on both positive and negative aspects of li fe following transplantation should be provided so patients are better prepared to deal with life after transplantation. Issues associated with minorities and transplantation need more attention. In particular, minority groups lack education and informati on about organ donation. In turn, organ donation is typically not discussed with significant others (Wheeler & Cheung, 1996). Wheeler and Cheung emphasize cultural sensitivity is important for the integration 174 of minorities into the transplant process. Nurs es should be aware of the issues associated with minority attitudes toward organ donation in order to better educate and address questions and concerns related to organ donation. The strong relationship between QOL and illness distress emphasizes the need to minimize post -transplant illness distress in order to enhance QOL. Data from this study suggest adverse changes in illness distress may be subtle, but should be expected four to five years following transplantation. Unfortunately, health care providers may give post - transplant patients less attention during this time, thinking immediate pre -and post - transplant are most distressing. Individualized assessment of the patient's ongoing experience of illness distress will provide nurses more accurate informa tion for supporting the patient's needs across the entire transplant experience. As seen in studies of other chronic populations, ST scores were high for liver transplant recipients. While a weak non -significant relationship between ST and age was noted , the stability of scores across time suggests ST may be driven more by end -of-life experiences rather than age and supports Reed's thesis (1991b). Nurses caring for patients awaiting transplantation or caring for patients during the first few years immedi ately following transplantation should be sensitive to the individual's heightened capacity for transcendence and should encourage activities to strengthen the individual's attempts to make meaning out of the transplant experience. Moch (1989) stressed get ting in touch with the meaning in disease or illness enable as person to experience \"health -within - illness.\" Smucker (1996) suggests nursing interventions to support the patient in making meaning include encouraging the patient to be aware of feelings, ope n to new ways of 175 thinking, to not be afraid of the questions, and to look ahead to the new meaning that is possible as a result of the event. QOL was found to be related to increasing age, being married, having a higher self-rated health status, and being employed. Individuals who are younger, not married, have a lower health status, or who are unemployed may require more support during their post-transplant experience. The proposed theoretical framework for this study was supported and suggests ST does de velop during the crisis of liver transplantation to facilitate a positive outcome reflected as high QOL. In addition, other factors also contribute to the post -transplant recipient's QOL including illness distress, fatigue, and age. Nurses should be aware of how these variables may influence QOL and incorporate them in assessment and planning. Research Recommendations Because of the large number of Caucasian participants in the current study, studies focused on specific ethnic groups (African American, As ian Pacific, Hispanic) are needed to understand more clearly the relationships between the variables of interest in these ethnic groups. Qualitative investigation would be particularly helpful in identifying aspects of each variable unique to a particular ethnic group. Replication of relationships identified in the current study are needed from diverse populations in other geographic settings. Additional investigation of the adequacy of financial resources in more diverse liver transplant populations is als o suggested Structural equation modeling would be useful in exploring direct and indirect 176 relationships among these variables. A longitudinal study would clarify if relationships are stable or dynamic over time. More study is also needed addressing conflic ting reports on gender differences for QOL among transplant recipients. In particular, measurement issues relative to gender in QOL may be an issue. Qualitative investigation seems particularly important to tease out subtle gender -specific differences that may exist for QOL. In turn, these differences could then be considered in QOL measures to more accurately capture differences relative to gender. Further interpretation of the relationship between QOL, ST, illness distress, and fatigue is warranted. Very little information exists in the literature regarding illness distress, yet it was clearly the most important predictor of QOL in this sample. More in depth development of knowledge surrounding this concept is clearly indicated including longitudinal chang es in illness distress following transplantation. Structural modeling would be useful to tease out the precise relationship noted to be significant in the tested regression model. ST seems important in the liver transplant recipient's experience of QOL. O ther spiritual concepts may also contribute positive outcomes and should also be investigated in this population. Fatigue was significantly related to ST, QOL, and illness distress; however, this variable has received little attention in patient populatio ns other than oncology. The changes in time -since-transplant cohorts relative to relationships among QOL, ST, illness distress, and fatigue are puzzling and require further study. 177 A holistic approach to conceptualization of QOL in liver transplant recipien ts was supported by the qualitative descriptions provided by informants. Incidental findings suggest attitude (optimism vs. pessimism) may also play an important role in post - transplant experiences. Incorporation of a measure of attitude is suggested for f uture QOL investigations. Data from this study reflect only post -transplant experiences of subjects and therefore does not allow for comparison to pre -transplant experiences. Longitudinal studies of the liver transplant recipients' experiences from the pr e-transplant experience through the post -transplant period are needed to fully understand the dynamic nature of the variables under study. In addition, post -transplant QOL may be experienced differently for patients who were acutely ill and quickly transpl anted compared to those who were chronically ill and waiting for transplant over a longer period of time. No studies to date have addressed these differences, though future studies comparing QOL outcomes for these groups seems important to assure accurate information and interventions are provided for all patients. Conclusions Nurses caring for transplant recipients must read and incorporate findings from QOL studies in the care of these individuals. In this investigation, self -rated QOL and ST were high f or liver transplant recipients while self -ratings of illness distress and fatigue were low. Females had significantly higher ST scores than males and ST scores were highest for those transplanted most recently ( < 2 years). Activities to strengthen the 178 individual's attempts to make meaning out of the transplant experience should be encouraged, especially for those patients who have recently received a transplant. Individualized assessment of the patient's post -transplant experience is key in developing an ef fective plan of care. Comorbidities associated with transplantation, particularly medication side effects, were frequently cited as having an effect on participant's QOL. In addition, there was a strong relationship between QOL and illness distress, and il lness distress scores were highest four to five years following transplantation. While little research exists on illness distress, it was the most important predictor of QOL in this group of liver transplant recipients. These findings emphasize the need to minimize post -transplant comorbidities and illness distress in order to enhance the transplant recipient's QOL experience. In addition, it is important for nurses to further explore these relationships empirically. Self-transcendence, illness distress, f atigue, and age, as important factors contributing to QOL in liver transplant recipients, should be incorporated in the nurse's assessment and planning. Additional investigation of these relationships in diverse populations for other geographic settings i s needed, however, to further clarify the relationships among these variables. The experience of quality of life for liver transplant recipients is a complex phenomenon requiring in depth investigation. This study has contributed additional knowledge regar ding the relationship between QOL and ST, illness distress, and fatigue as well as other demographic factors (age, marital status, health status, employment) in liver transplant recipients. Additional analysis of the study data and further research into 179 these areas of knowledge will hopefully provide more understanding and knowledge to direct the care and support of this patient population. 180 APPENDIX A Baylor University Medical Center Introductory Letters 181 182 February 2002 Dear Liver Transplant Recipien t, As you have seen in the accompanying letter from Dr. Levy, I am conducting a study to complete my doctoral dissertation dealing with quality of life for liver transplant recipients.
