Annabelle Natalie Gibson failed to appear in Melbourne's Federal Court for the fourth time on Tuesday for a hearing with Consumer Affairs Victoria. The consumer watchdog launched legal action against the disgraced author after she falsely claimed to use 'natural remedies' to cure terminal cancer during the marketing of her Whole Pantry app and book, which made the 24-year-old $578,005. Consumer Affairs told the court the mother-of-one engaged in 'unconscionable conduct' by claiming she was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2009 and given only four months to live before miraculously healed herself naturally after rejecting conventional treatments.

Gibson told her Facebook and Instagram followers she started receiving oral chemotherapy for her cancer before abandoning conventional medicine. 'I pulled myself out. My doctors freaked out but they couldn't stop me,' Ms Button quoted Gibson as saying. Gibson then told her large social media following she started 'getting back to basics' and opted for healthy foods and natural therapies which healed her cancer, the court heard. In July 2013 she posted on The Whole Pantry - Live Healthy Facebook account that she had been healing used only 'natural medicine, gerson therapy and foods' and shamed those who were trying to 'discredit' her healing path.

In July 2014, she broke the news of further illness to her followers through an impassioned post to her personal Instagram page. It read in part: 'With frustration and ache in my heart // my beautiful, gamechanging community, it hurts me to find space tonight to let you all know with love and strength that I've been diagnosed with a third and fourth cancer. 'One is secondary and the other is primary. I have cancer in my blood, spleen, brain, uterus, and liver. I am hurting,' Ms Gibson wrote.

Gibson removed the posts once it was revealed her diagnosis and health empire was a sham. 'Her publisher went out and published her book on the basis of her claims,' Ms Button said on Tuesday.
