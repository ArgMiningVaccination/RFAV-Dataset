If meditation is hard for you, and you find it difficult to sit still, incorporating crystals might be the perfect thing to overcome this. Using crystals while meditating gives your mind something to focus on so it will wander less during meditation. Here are five easy ways to meditate with your crystals. Hold Them If you like to sit while meditating, try holding a crystal in your hand. You can start with one crystal in your left hand, and then try one crystal in each hand. Your left hand is for receiving and your right hand is for giving. If you are working on bringing more financial wealth into your life, a great crystal to try is citrine. Hold it in your left hand while meditating to tell the universe you're ready to receive more money. It's always nice to send positive vibes back into the world, so that's when you might want to hold a crystal in your right hand as well. Maybe a friend of yours received some bad news and you've been thinking about them and would like to send them some love. Try holding a rose quartz in your right hand while you meditate to send them some positive healing vibes. Some people like to switch the crystals around after they've been meditating for a few minutes to bring the meditation full circle. If you have a different type of crystal in each hand, part way through your meditation, you can switch hands and see what happens. Look at Them Crystals have all kinds of interesting lines etched on the surface and deep within. A fun meditation to try where you don't need to close your eyes is simply looking at your crystal. What patterns do you see? Do things change when you hold it up to the light? Look at your crystal and see what you notice about it. Turn it around and look at it from all angles. Place Them on Your Body This is a great meditation to try if you like to lie down while meditating. You can place a crystal on each [chakra](https://www.freeingthebutterfly.com/blog/energy-work-101-to-get-unstuck). Choose one that is the same color as the chakra. If you don't have one that matches the color, that's okay. Work with what you have. There's no wrong way to work with crystals. Another way to use crystals on your body is based on what you want to work on. For example, if you have a sore knee, place crystals around your knee while you meditate. Be sure to set the intention that you want the crystals to take away your knee pain before you meditate. Rub Them Rubbing your crystals while you meditate is a fun way to focus your energy. If you're easily distracted during meditation, try rubbing your crystal when you feel like your mind is wandering. Notice how it feels. Is it smooth or rough? Can you feel any cracks or divots? Does the crystal warm to your touch? Put Them in the Bath Meditation isn't simply sitting or lying down with your eyes closed. You can meditate by taking a bath. As long as your mind is calm and not running a million miles a minute, you are meditating. A fun way to incorporate crystals into your meditation practice is by placing them in your bath. If you're going to try this, you'll want to make sure the crystals you choose are water-safe. Some crystals will dissolve in water, so don't use those ones in your bath. Some water-safe crystals to try are any of the crystals in the quartz family (clear quartz, rose quartz, amethyst, citrine) and calcite.
