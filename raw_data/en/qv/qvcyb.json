A review is conducted annually by the Indian Health Service ( IHS) in order to determine compliance with crucial s afety and quality requirements . Results of the review are used to plan improvements in the treatment and services provided to American Indian/Alaskan Native peoples and others who receive care at UIO . In order to assist staff anticipate and prepare for the annual review, a copy of the manual is provided to each UIO . The requirements contained in the Urban Indian Organization On-site Review Manual are based on relevant, current standards of national healthcare accrediting organizations. These organizations include the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (AAAHC) , The Joint Commission (TJC), The Commission on the Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities (CARF) and The Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program (HFAP). In addition some requirements are based on relevant chapters from the Indian Health Manual . Following review by the IHS , the staff of the Urban Indian Organization are asked to implement a corrective action plan for all requirements score d \"0\" as non-compliant or \"1\" as partially compliant . Although the Urban Indian Organization On-site Review Manual is based on current accreditation standards, it is not intended as a substitute for standards manuals separately published by these national organizations that are used by healthcare facility staff to prepare for formal accreditation survey visits . If you have any questions regarding the purpose or content of this Review Manual , please contact the Office of Urban Indian Health Programs, Indian Health Service, 801 Thompson Avenue, Suite 200, Rockville, Maryland 20852, phone (301) 443 -4680. 1 BACKGROUND The Indian Health Care Improvement Act , as amended at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1655, states that the Indian Health Service (IHS) will annually review and evaluate each UIO funded under the law. This manual was prepared to assist the IHS in conducting structured program reviews of UIO. Section 1655 states, in part: Section 1655 . (a) The Secretary, through the Service, shall develop procedures to evaluate compliance with grant requirements under this subchapter and compliance with, and performance of contracts entered into by UIO under this subchapter . Such procedures shall include provisions for carrying out the requirements of this section. Section 1655 . (b) The Secretary, t hrough the Service, shall conduct an annual on- site evaluation of each UIO which has entered into a contract or received a grant under section 1653 of this title for purposes of determining the compliance of such organization with, and evaluating the perfo rmance of such organization under, such contract or the terms of such grant. The Office of Urban Indian Health Programs (O UIO) On-site Review Manual shall be used to accomplish this annual evaluation. Should the UIO being reviewed possess current accredita tion from an accrediting body recognized by the IHS, it can submit a written request to the Director, O UIO through the appropriate Area Urban Coordinator (AUC) and the Area Director (AD) for a limited waiver. The request for limited waiver should be submit ted at least 90 days in advance of the next anticipated annual review based on the previous year's anniversary review date. An approved waiver will limit the annual review only to the following sections of the Manual: Section I - Legislative Review Section II - Governance Section III - Administration Section IV - Financial If an accredited UIO would like an annual review of any additional sections , this will be done as a consultation rather than a formal review. The Director of the UIO must make thi s request in writing to the AUC and the AD. The AUC will attempt to make arrangements for such requests and coordinate any additional reviews with the UIO Director. 2 ANNUAL URBAN INDIAN ORGANIZATION REVIEW Urban Indian Organization Program Name Street Address City, State, Zip Code Facility Contact and Title Phone Number E-mail Address IHS Area Office Area UIO Coordinator Phone Number E-mail Address Date Contacted IHS Project Officer Area Chief Medical Office Area Director Contact Date Site Visit Date Site Visit Notification Letter Sent Letter Sent By Review Dates Contact Person at UIO Contact Phone Number Review Team Members Review Date Sections to be Reviewed The agenda for the annual review should be planned before the start date for the visit.
