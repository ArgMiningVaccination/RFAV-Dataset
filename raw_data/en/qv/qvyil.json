Composition of the roster of trained inspectors as of May 2003 .......................... 424S/2003/580 I. Introduction and salient points 1. The present report, which is the thirteentha submitted in accordance with paragraph 12 of Security Council resolution 1284 (1999), covers the activities of theUnited Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC)during the period from 1 March to 31 May 2003. The present introduction highlightssome of the events and experience of the Commission. 2. During the period under review, the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC briefed the Security Council on 7 March (on the twelfth quarterly report), on19 March (on the draft work programme required under resolution 1284 (1999)) andon 22 April 2003 (on the Commission's readiness to return to Iraq to resumeinspections). He also maintained his practice of meeting each of the respectivePresidents of the Security Council. The Secretary-General and his senior staff werekept informed on a continuing basis of the activities of the Commission. 3. On 18 March 2003, UNMOVIC suspended its inspection activities following the decision of the Secretary-General to withdraw all United Nations staff from Iraq.The armed action started on 19 March 2003, and the Coalition has organized units toidentify any Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and other proscribed items and toengage in the task of disarming Iraq, which was formerly pursued by UNMOVICand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). 4. Following the withdrawal from Iraq, UNMOVIC staff drawn from the roster were sent home and contracts for services, such as transportation by fixed- androtary-wing aircraft, were ended or assigned to other United Nations operations.UNMOVIC headquarters staff have been and remain engaged in analysis of theinspections performed and in the updating of site files, subject files and otherdocumentation in the light of the inspection reports. A thorough review is also beingundertaken of the voluminous information provided by Iraq, not least during theperiod under review in the present report. In the months to come, it may also bedesirable that UNMOVIC headquarters staff engage in summarizing and digestingthe unique experience gained in such areas as defining dual-use materials andmonitoring the export/import of dual-use items. 5. The findings and experience of the relevant units established by the Coalition have not been made available to the Commission except through public mediareports. Nor have those units or the Coalition requested any information orassistance from the Commission. 6. In resolution 1483 (2003) of 22 May 2003, the Security Council reaffirmed the importance of the disarmament of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and theeventual confirmation of the disarmament of Iraq. In paragraph 11, the Councilreaffirmed that Iraq must meet its disarmament obligations, invited the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America tokeep the Council informed of their activities in that regard, and underlined itsintention to revisit the mandates of UNMOVIC and IAEA as set forth in severalearlier resolutions. 7. Since the Commission's work on disarmament in Iraq, which began on 27 November 2002, has been suspended, and since a significant phase of that workhas been concluded, the present report provides more detail than previous reports. In5S/2003/580 addition, the report does not restrict itself to reviewing information from the period 1 March to 31 May 2003 but in a number of places adopts a wider perspective. 8. In the period during which it performed inspection and monitoring in Iraq, UNMOVIC did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programmesof weapons of mass destruction or significant quantities of proscribed items frombefore the adoption of resolution 687 (1991). 9. Inspections uncovered a small number of undeclared empty chemical warheads which appear to have been produced prior to 1990. Those and a few other proscribeditems were destroyed. 10. Following a determination by the Commission that the Al Samoud 2 missile system exceeded the range limits set by the Security Council and hence wasproscribed, the Commission implemented a programme for destruction. Some 70missiles and associated equipment were destroyed under Commission supervisionbefore its operations were suspended. At that time, a decision by the Commissionwas pending as to whether the Al Fatah missile system also exceeded the ranges setby the Council. 11. Inspections and declarations and documents submitted by Iraq, not least during the period under review, contributed to a better understanding of previous weaponsprogrammes. However, the long list of proscribed items unaccounted for and as suchresulting in unresolved disarmament issues was not shortened either by theinspections or by Iraqi declarations and documentation. From the end of January2003, the Iraqi side, which until then had been cooperative in terms of process butnot equally cooperative in terms of subsistence, devoted much effort to providingexplanations and proposing methods of inquiry into such issues as the productionand destruction of anthrax, VX and long-range missiles. Despite those efforts, littleprogress was made in the solution of outstanding issues during the time ofUNMOVIC operations in Iraq. 12. For example, as described in the present report, extensive excavations undertaken by the Iraqi side and witnessed by inspectors showed that a large numberof R-400 bombs declared to have contained biological agents and to have beenunilaterally destroyed in 1991 were in fact destroyed. While it was valuable insuggesting the credibility of some information provided earlier, the operation couldnot verify the total quantities of biological agents destroyed, still less the totalquantities produced. 13. Again, with respect to anthrax, the Commission, as it reported, had strong indications \u2014 but not conclusive evidence \u2014 that all the quantities produced hadnot been destroyed, and that hence even today such quantities could remain. Whilethe Iraqi side continued to claim that no documentary evidence remained of thedestruction operation, it took two different steps in an effort to prove its declarationthat all had been destroyed. As described in the present report, the Iraqi sideundertook a chemical analysis of soil samples from the site where a quantity ofanthrax was declared to have been dumped in 1991. While the results of the analysiswere consistent with the declaration that anthrax had been dumped at the site, thestudy could not provide evidence of the quantities destroyed. The other step takenby the Iraqi side was to supply lists of the persons who in 1991 had been engaged inthe operations to destroy anthrax. Regrettably, those lists were received only shortly6S/2003/580 before the suspension of inspections and the Commission did not have the opportunity to embark on a series of potentially important interviews. 14. By the time inspections were suspended, the Commission had performed a number of inspections to try to verify, as described in the present report, intelligenceinformation that Iraq had mobile units for the production of biological weapons. TheIraqi side denied that any such units existed and provided the Commission withpictures of legitimate vehicles, which they suggested could have been mistaken formobile units. However, none of the vehicles in those pictures resembles the trucksrecently described and depicted by the Coalition. 15. As also described in the present report, the Commission was not able, before the suspension of inspections, to complete its inquiry into the Iraqi programmes ofremotely piloted vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles, notably to establish whetherany of them were designed for the dissemination of chemical or biological weaponsor had a longer range than was permitted. Extensive Iraqi information on theprogramme was sent to the Commission as late as 19 March 2003. 16. At the end of the present report, the Commission's readiness for resumed inspection activities is described. Until the Security Council revisits the mandate ofthe Commission, the resolutions which guided its work until the armed action willcontinue to be implemented to the extent that they are still relevant and have notbeen rendered obsolete by resolution 1483 (2003). It is clear that most of the workwhich the Commission has performed to date relating to the Oil for FoodProgramme will be phased out, and that as a result some staff will be released. Areadiness for possible resumed work in Iraq, for example to confirm findings thatmay have been made since the end of the Commission's inspections and/or toperform the task of ongoing monitoring and verification, can be maintained with asomewhat smaller staff than the Commission currently has at its headquarters,thereby reducing costs. However, it would be inadvisable to undertake any drasticoverall reduction in the current cadre of staff, which is fully acquainted with thedatabase and vast archives of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)and UNMOVIC and has broad knowledge of programmes, sites and relevantcontacts in Iraq, as well as the logistics of inspection operations. II. Inspections in Iraq A. General 17. From the day of the first inspection in Iraq on 27 November 2002 until the dayof the withdrawal of all United Nations personnel on 18 March 2003, UNMOVICconducted 731 inspections, covering 411 sites, 88 of which had not been inspectedbefore. The sites had either been declared by Iraq during inspections or through theirsemi-annual declarations, or had been selected by UNMOVIC on the basis ofoutside information. Aerial inspections were also conducted using UNMOVIChelicopters. 18. During the first several weeks of inspections, the focus was on re-establishing a baseline for the sites, that is, to assess the current activities and equipment at thesite, determine the changes made since 1998 and identify existing key personnel.Sites visited included previously known sites and new sites for the most part7S/2003/580 identified through Iraq's newly provided declarations. Almost all inspections were undertaken without notice to Iraq. Visits of sites followed no order in terms ofnature of site, apparent importance and location. The early inspections providedknowledge about Iraq's current programmes and about the main state companiesinvolved in such activities. As information became available from a study of Iraq'srecent semi-annual declarations and its \"currently accurate full and completedeclaration of 7 December 2002, a number of inspections were undertaken to verifyor clarify various matters in these documents. 19. The second period, from mid-January until the suspension of activities in Iraq in mid-March 2003, was characterized by reinspection of some of the sites, with amore investigative approach. During those inspections, a thorough assessment wasmade of both dual-use capabilities and the amount of time that would be needed toreconfigure specific installations to perform proscribed activities. 20. Figure I illustrates the number of UNMOVIC site inspections made per week during the inspection period. The figure shows the initial period of build-up of theinspection teams until the middle of December and the high intensity of inspectionsover the rest of the period. Figure II illustrates the distribution of the inspectioneffort over different types of sites. The largest effort was expended on industrial andresearch and development sites, followed by military sites, including militarydepots. The distribution of inspections among the missile, chemical, biological andmultidisciplinary teams is shown in figure III, while the geographic distribution ofinspected sites throughout Iraq is shown in figure IV . As can be seen from figure IV ,the relatively large concentration of inspections in the Mosul area underscores therationale for establishing a regional office there. By the time of the withdrawal,UNMOVIC had not established a regional office in Basrah. B. Biological inspections 21. Biological inspections were made of university laboratories, pharmaceuticalfactories, munitions stores, military sites, warehouses, vaccine production and food-processing facilities, breweries, research institutions and agricultural sites. Abiological analytical laboratory was established at the Baghdad OngoingMonitoring, Verification and Inspection Centre (BOMVIC) for sample processingand screening. C. Chemical inspections 22. Chemical inspections covered pesticide and organophosphorus-relatedfacilities, the petrochemical industry, fertilizer plants, munitions storage andmilitary sites, research and academic institutions, warehouses, chemical productionequipment and chemical engineering sites. 23. During the first period of inspections, from December 2002 to mid-January 2003, priority was given to inspections of key sites. Those inspections enabledUNMOVIC to develop an overview of the current status of the chemical industryand related services in Iraq.S/2003/580 8 Figure 1 Total number of UNMOVIC site inspections made during the period 27 November 2002-17 March 2003 01020304050607080Inspections per week 25 2 9 16 23 30613 20 27 3 10 17 24 3 10 17 23 November December January February March27/11 17/039S/2003/580 Figure II Types of sites inspected Military 12% R&D and educational 24%Others 5% Other production facilities 4%Missile-related production plants 16%Processing and production plants 49%Industrial 38%Food and medicine production plants 22% Ammunitions production plants 9%Storage and support 9%Management 5% Health care 5%10S/2003/580 Figure III Inspections by discipline (27 November 2002 - 17 March 2003) Missile 30%Multidisciplinary 20%Chemical 22% Biological 28%11S/2003/580 Figure IV12S/2003/580 24. During the same period, the chemical laboratory was brought up to its full capacity and there was an increase in the number and quality of samples analysed. Alarge number of on-site analyses, such as alloys identification, were carried out. Inaddition, the planning process started for the future use of the laboratory formonitoring. D. Missile inspections 25. Inspections in the missile area involved key missile production and researchand development sites. 26. For the first weeks of missile inspections, the focus was on checking, tagging and re-tagging of equipment, particularly of the Al Samoud, Al Fatah, SA-2 andFrog missiles. In addition, inspections were carried out of all static test stands forboth solid and liquid propellant rockets, and one flight test of a modified missilewas monitored. 27. Later in the inspection period, while tagging activities continued, inspections concentrated on four areas: known sites that had not yet been visited; sites forassessing Iraq's capability in missile guidance and control; assessment of Iraq'scapability in solid propellant rocket technology; and assessments of sites for themost effective way of implementing future ongoing monitoring and verification. 28. Following the UNMOVIC conclusion that the Al Samoud 2 missile and two previously destroyed but refurbished casting chambers were prohibited, Iraq wasrequested to present those items for destruction. Most inspections carried out duringMarch involved making an inventory of related items and observing the destructionactivity. The destruction of all items of the Al Samoud 2 missile system was notfully completed until 18 March 2003. In addition, inspections were carried outfollowing the release by Iraq of items and materials connected to indigenous Scudengine manufacture. E. Multidisciplinary inspections 29. Multidisciplinary inspections were performed at many different types of site.However, the emphasis was on non-chemical, biological and missile sites, such ascentral customs offices; engineering companies and military nuclear, biological andchemical defence facilities; military vehicles design and construction sites;presidential sites; and private homes. The regional office in Mosul served as animportant base for conducting inspections in northern Iraq that otherwise could havebeen visited only after long road trips or utilizing air-transport capabilities. 30. Inspection of ammunition storage areas was an important part of the work of multidisciplinary teams throughout the inspection period. Munitions experts,utilizing both visual recognition techniques and appropriate detectors, conducted in-depth searches of munitions production, storage and disposal areas, which resultedin the detection of (empty) munitions that might have gone unnoticed if the searcheshad relied solely or primarily on technical means to detect toxic or infectiousmaterial. 31. A further aspect of the multidisciplinary team's activities was the support provided by explosive ordnance disposal specialists to the other disciplines. Those13S/2003/580 specialists performed a vital safety function at many military sites and, when needed, provided expertise for all munitions-related inspections, drilling andsampling. 32. Lastly, a number of sites were inspected by the multidisciplinary teams following information provided by Governments or derived from open sources. F. General operational issues 1. Implementation of the multidisciplinary approach to inspections 33. As recommended in the Amorim panel report (see S/1999/356, para. 40), amultidisciplinary approach to inspections was established for UNMOVIC fieldoperations. Inspection teams, consisting of experts with different scientificbackgrounds, were set up, which allowed the conduct of competent inspections atsites with multiple activities. As a result, a more complete understanding of the siteswas developed since it was possible to obtain, in addition to information ascertainedunder a specific discipline, complementary information about procurement,contracts and relationships with other companies and national and foreign suppliers. 2. Guidelines 34. UNMOVIC operations and activities have been guided by the relevant SecurityCouncil resolutions and other basic documents. In addition, there have been detailedinternal procedures, guidelines and policy documents, including an administrativemanual, a glossary, a draft handbook and guidelines for health and safety duringoperations in Iraq; the latter two documents were particularly relevant duringinspections. 35. The draft UNMOVIC handbook is divided into three parts. Part I covers all aspects of UNMOVIC operations and activities, inter alia, inspection and reinforcedongoing monitoring; aerial surveillance; transportation; responsibilities; the media; and Iraq'sobligations. Part II contains discipline-specific procedures as well as policydocuments on, inter alia, sampling and analysis of chemical and biological weaponsagents; sampling of solid propellants and their ingredients; tagging of missiles; anddisposition of prohibited items or unidentified dual-use items. Part III contains thetexts of relevant governing resolutions and related legal instruments. The drafthandbook was initially presented to the UNMOVIC College of Commissioners inFebruary 2001; it was completed taking into account the Commissioner's comments.UNMOVIC has been guided by the provisions of the draft handbook in its activities.The draft handbook was also used as a reference basis during the talks (July andSeptember/October 2002) held between UNMOVIC, IAEA and the Government ofIraq on the practical arrangements related to the resumptions of inspections in Iraq,and material contained in the draft handbook has been used in UNMOVIC trainingcourses. The draft handbook was revised and updated on 6 December 2002 to takeinto account the provisions of resolution 1441 (2002) and its annex. The latestrevision was made on 11 March 2003 to incorporate practice developed duringinspection activities. 36. The UNMOVIC administrative manual, issued by the Chairman in November 2001, is a compendium of administrative rules and procedures covering, inter alia,14S/2003/580 communications and records, personnel matters and management of confidentiality. As a supplementary document to United Nations established rules, the manual wasintended to guide UNMOVIC personnel in the discharge of their responsibilities. 3. Establishment of a regional office in Mosul 37. In December 2002, it was decided to establish a regional office in the north ofIraq in the city of Mosul to be operated by a multidisciplinary team of inspectors. 38. Offices were established in the Ninevah Palace Hotel in Mosul. The first inspection by the Mosul team was conducted on 5 January 2003, the day after theteam's arrival. The office continued its operations until 17 March 2003. The IraqiGovernment also established a regional branch of its National MonitoringDirectorate in Mosul to support UNMOVIC activities in the northern region of thecountry. 39. Operating a regional office provided several advantages, such as increased number and efficiency of inspections due to the relatively short travel distancesthereby obtained to a significant number of sites in northern Iraq, and increasedeffectiveness, including the attainment of unannounced access to sites. 4. Air operations Logistics support 40. The Commission's aerial assets were an important part of the mission. Various aircraft were used for the transport of personnel and equipment as well as for aerialsurveillance over Iraq. The Commission had one L-100 transport aircraft based inBaghdad to provide an air bridge to Larnaca, the site of the Commission's fieldoffice in Cyprus. From November 2002 until 18 March 2003, about 550 hours wereflown by that aircraft, during which it carried 1,254 passengers and 332 tons ofcargo. The Commission also operated five Bell 212 and three MI-8 helicopters.These were based at the Rasheed Airbase in Baghdad, where an aerial operationsoffice was established. The first helicopter flight for inspection purposes took placeon 7 January 2003. The helicopters provided transport for inspectors and equipmentthroughout Iraq. Helicopter operations took place from late December 2002 untilMarch 2003. During that period, the helicopters logged 377 flight hours and carried1,058 passengers and 5.8 tons of equipment. The combined aircrews and relatedsupport staff comprised 57 persons. Surveillance 41. Aerial surveillance in support of ground operations and monitoring of activities at distant sites was carried out after operations procedures and security inthe no-fly zones was agreed upon with the United States and Iraqi authorities. ABell 212 helicopter equipped for the acquisition of aerial imagery and night flightwas used for surveillance. The equipment consisted of a cockpit-installed infraredsystem plus a standard video camera. That technique was also used to identify, bydirect observation, new sites to be inspected. Eight aerial surveillance/monitoringmissions were carried out. 42. The United States and France supported the Commission through the provision of high-altitude U2 and medium-altitude Mirage IV surveillance aircraft. Iraq raised15S/2003/580 some security questions that resulted in delays in the start of those operations. Those questions were resolved on 10 February and operation of the U2 and the Mirage IVcommenced on 17 and 26 February 2003, respectively. In total, 16 reconnaissanceflights were made until the middle of March 2003, eight by the U2 and eight by theMirage IV . 43. Discussions with the Governments of Germany and the Russian Federation on the provision of unmanned aerial vehicles and AN-30 surveillance aircraft wereunder way and the deployment of those aircraft had not yet begun when theinspectors withdrew from Iraq. The Commission remains grateful to allGovernments that supported or were ready to support its air operations. 5. Overhead imagery 44. UNMOVIC photographic interpreters processed and analysed imagery insupport of the UNMOVIC mandate. The imagery was obtained from a number ofdifferent sources, including commercial satellites and Mirage IV and U2 aircraft.While inspections were under way, overhead imagery and other imagery-derivedproducts, such as maps and line diagrams, were provided in hard copy and digitalformat to the Division of Planning and Operations. The different aerial platformswere in turn tasked to collect imagery of specific sites and areas in response toUNMOVIC requirements. Extensive use was made of imagery to research sitesgiven by intelligence. It is notable that during the period after UNMOVIC'screation, technological advances have greatly improved timely access to goodquality overhead satellite imagery. Timely access to the imagery acquired throughthe Mirage IV and U2 aircraft has also improved greatly with the enhancement ofcommunication capabilities. 6. Interviews and lists of Iraqi personnel 45. During the period 1 to 17 March 2003, UNMOVIC made 15 requests forinterviews with Iraqi scientists, bringing the total number of requests since January2003 to 54. During that short period, nine interviews were actually conducted, thelast one on 17 March, bringing the total number of interviews in all disciplines to14. All interviews were conducted under UNMOVIC procedures and format: therewere no witnesses, recording or videotaping and interviews were conducted inlocations selected by UNMOVIC. 46. Interviewees were selected on the basis of UNMOVIC analysis of Iraqi chemical and biological weapons and missile programmes and using lists ofpersonnel provided by Iraq. Seven chemical, six biological and one missile-relatedinterviews were conducted. The individuals included both decision-making staff andscientific, engineering and technical personnel. Interviews were subject-oriented,addressing such issues as specific types of chemical or biological production,chemical precursors or unilateral destruction operations. Information obtainedduring interviews was found useful and led in some cases to an updating of theassessments contained in the Commission's list of unresolved disarmament issues. 47. It should be noted that the above-mentioned process of formal interviews was pursued in addition to the discussions that frequently took place with the Iraqimanagers and relevant technical staff at inspection sites.16S/2003/580 48. Iraq provided 31 separate lists of names, which were attached to 10 different letters pertaining to all aspects of its weapons of mass destruction programmes, thelast dated 17 March 2003. Regarding the names associated with unilateraldestruction of prohibited materials, two of the lists gave the names of expertsinvolved in the handling and destruction of missile and chemical equipment andmaterials, and three included the names of personnel associated with the unilateraldestruction of biological weapons and agents. The amount of information providedin those letters that was not included in previous declarations varied according toweapons disciplines. Chemical 49. A list related to the unilateral destruction of chemical munitions during the summer of 1991 contained 83 names of experts involved in the destruction of emptyaerial bombs, empty 122 mm munitions, R-400 aerial bombs, choline and alcohol-filled al-Hussein missile warheads. Most of the names were of high-level scientistsand military officers. Many of the persons named were previously unknown toUNMOVIC or at least not known to have been involved in unilateral destructionactions. For instance, in the letter dated 17 March 2003, the names of two personsinvolved in the drafting of the so-called air force document were mentioned. Missiles 50. The information provided contains the names of 63 persons associated with the destruction of missiles and missile-related items, presumably the Scud-type missiles,engines, warheads and other equipment and components Iraq declared it hadunilaterally destroyed during the summer of 1991. Biological 51. A letter dated 17 March 2003 contained the names of 215 persons associated with biological weapons. All but two of the names had been submitted toUNMOVIC in previous letters. Those lists did, however, add some significantdetails, in that whereas the original lists appeared to be simply a list of namesordered chronologically according to when a person joined the programme, the newlists were structured along the organizational lines that UNMOVIC had originallyrequested. Among the 215 names provided, six were associated with the destructionof munitions, six with the destruction of warheads, two with the destruction ofR-400 gravity bombs and 19 with the destruction of biological agents. There was,however, considerable duplication of names since a number of people worked inmultiple fields. * * * 52. In view of Iraq's claim that no documents existed concerning its unilateral destruction of prohibited materials and in view of the importance that suchdestruction has for the accounting of biological and chemical weapons, interviewswith persons on the above-mentioned lists might have provided significantinformation.17S/2003/580 G. Integration of advanced technologies for inspection 53. In addition to the portable chemical and biological detectors for in situ direct determination of traces of chemical and biological agents, UNMOVIC inspectorshad at their disposal advanced geophysical equipment for the search of hiddenstructures and storage spaces that could be used for hiding precursors, agents orweapons of mass destruction. Of special interest was the capability of thoseadvanced technologies to detect concealed spaces and passages that could be usedfor storage, laboratories or production facilities nearby or under large buildings,such as factories, hospitals and military installations. In order to be more effective,combinations of techniques were used according to site characteristics. Thetechniques available are described below. 1. Ground-penetrating radar 54. Ground-penetrating radar surveys detect the disturbance in the pattern of high-frequency electromagnetic waves in the ground caused by hidden structures, such asburied pipes, hidden shafts, buried materials, different porosity and soil densities.Surveys are easily and rapidly run. They provide visual data display in real time,which is important for on-the-spot decisions whether or not to excavate. The depthcapability of the system is up to 15 to 20 m, depending on the frequency of theantenna used. 2. Electromagnetic induction soil change mapping 55. Electromagnetic induction responds to changes in the electrical resistivity ofthe ground. It is useful for mapping changes in the thickness of overlying material,thereby pointing to suspicious areas where local soil has been replaced by moreresistive material, such as concealed structures. 3. Computer and server forensics 56. Information contained in hard disks and servers at inspected facilities andgovernment offices may help to identify the kind of activities which are pursued andconnections with suppliers of materials or services. It may also be helpful to finddocuments pertaining to projects, organization, finances and personnel. Specificsoftware and hardware was purchased to seek such information, and three experts incomputer forensics were part of the multidisciplinary support team deployed in Iraq. 4. Remote drilling and sampling systems for munitions 57. Munitions opening for neutralization and identification of chemical agents iscurrently the most advanced technology available for sampling hazardous liquids,such as chemical or biological agents, in munitions. It allows inspectors to drillsafely into a munition, extract a sample of liquid contents and, when appropriate,drain the contents for subsequent destruction. It was successfully used to sample old155 mm artillery shells containing mustard gas and biological material fromexcavated R-400 bombs.18S/2003/580 III. Laboratories and sampling 58. UNMOVIC inspectors collected a total of 356 samples (254 chemical, 101 biological and one missile propellant) from a variety of sites. Laboratory analysisallowed inspectors to determine an industrial chemical's true identity, search forevidence of proscribed activities and verify the industrial or research activitiesassociated with the samples taken. For additional examination, a small number ofsamples were sent to outside laboratories under contract with UNMOVIC. Thoseprocedures gave UNMOVIC a credible means of checking inspection findings. 59. During the course of inspections, UNMOVIC laboratory staff began to establish an analysis regime to verify permissible industrial and researchactivities \u2014 an important step towards ongoing monitoring of Iraq's industry.Specifically, the analysis strategy had begun to change from looking for weapons ofmass destruction-related compounds only to a monitoring regime in whichUNMOVIC also looked for significant site activity changes. 60. UNMOVIC sample analysis methods were geared to detecting the smallest traces of chemical and biological agents. Inspectors at Iraqi sites screened thefacilities for the presence of toxic chemicals in the air, using military safetyequipment. Equipment was designed to detect only chemical agent vapours,however, and not chemical weapons precursors and degradation products orbiological agents. Therefore, UNMOVIC inspectors adopted an approach ofcollecting solid, liquid and surface swipe samples for screening at BOMVIC.Trained personnel collected the samples, using strict chain-of-custody rules tomaintain sample integrity. Using those procedures, UNMOVIC was able to detectthe widest spectrum of chemical and biological weapons-related compounds longafter any possible agents had been present on-site. 61. Iraqi declarations concerning material were in all cases verified by UNMOVIC sample-screening procedures. Declarations by Iraq on munitions said to containchemical or inactivated biological agents were consistent with verification results.Investigative samples taken in search of undeclared proscribed activities revealed nosuch activities. A. Chemical laboratory 62. The chemical laboratory at BOMVIC employed a number of steps forscreening samples, as set out below. On-site 63. Infrared spectroscopy (total attenuated reflectance-fourier transform infrared):this technique allows the analysis of pure solids and liquids, such as industrialfeedstocks, for absolute qualitative identification of approximately 10,000 differentchemical compounds, including relatively pure samples of all chemical agentprecursors and degradation compounds. 64. Vapour-inlet/headspace gas chromatography/mass spectrometry: this technique tests for volatile chemicals found in environmental or industrial samples. 65. X-ray fluorescence: this technique allows the verification of the alloy composition of potential dual-use metal parts.19S/2003/580 At the laboratory 66. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry: organic and/or aqueous extracts of samples were tested qualitatively for the G- and V-class nerve agents and for theblister agents lewisite and mustard gas. When necessary, those compounds couldalso be measured quantitatively using a validated method, with triethylphosphate asa standard. Precursors and degradation products of those agents (and manythousands of other compounds) could be detected qualitatively either by the directinjection of the extracts or by derivitization with silylating compounds. 67. Capillary electrophoresis: this technique was employed to quantitatively screen all samples for the primary degradation products of G- and V-class nerve agents.More than 95 per cent of the samples accepted by the UNMOVIC laboratory werescreened by this technique. 68. Wet chemistry methods: as a part of UNMOVIC plans to monitor Iraq's activities in the chemical area, inspectors intended to establish sensitive wetchemical analytical methods to quantitatively detect hydrofluoric acid, cyanides,iodine and the components of liquid missile fuels. 69. The distribution of samples collected and analysed was as follows: Chemical analysis performed on samples (27 November 2002-17 March 2003) Type of sample Number collected Stored chemicals 16 Reaction liquor 41 Equipment 83 Mustard gas 14 Ammunition 33 Infrastructure 53 Environmental 14 Total 254 B. Biological laboratory 70. The biological laboratory at BOMVIC performed initial screening of samples taken during inspection looking for undeclared activities involving biological threatagents. Sampling and screening procedures at BOMVIC were operationalthroughout the inspection period. 71. A total of 101 samples were taken from 17 sites. Some samples were taken for positive verification from universities, research and development or vaccine-producing facilities; others were taken to explore munitions fillings or residues, orto investigate whether undeclared activities with biological threat agents had beenundertaken. The distribution of samples was as follows:20S/2003/580 Distribution of biological samples (27 November 2002-17 March 2003) Type of sample Number collected Munitions fillings 40 Research and development and universities 10Vaccines and food industries 41Quality control laboratories 10 Total 101 72. The biological laboratory at BOMVIC used a number of assays for screening, as set out below. 73. Rapid polymerase chain reaction assays enabled testing for the biological threat agents Clostridium Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis . In early March 2003, the laboratory capability was expanded to include assays for the food poisoning micro-organisms Salmonella spp . and E. Coli O157:H7. 74. Immunological test cartridges enabled detection of the toxins ricin, botulinum toxin A and SEB toxin, and the biological threat agents B. anthracis , Y. pestis and F. tularensis . Early in March 2003, the biological laboratory also obtained test cartridges to screen for orthopox viruses. 75. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays allowed screening for botulinum toxin (high sensitivity) and the biological threat agents B. anthracis , Cl. botulinum toxin A and B, Cl. botulinum SEC, and orthopox viruses, including camel pox. 76. Of the 101 samples taken, 82 were screened at the biological laboratory at BOMVIC. In addition, 10 samples were screened for the chemical team and four forthe multidisciplinary team. All those samples were taken from ammunitions.Altogether, a total of 354 test runs were performed. Screening results of the samples,taken for positive verification, confirmed Iraqi statements on those samples. Thesamples which were taken to investigate undeclared activities with biological threatagents revealed no undeclared or possible proscribed activities. Screening ofmunitions samples yielded similar negative results. C. Analysis at laboratories outside Iraq 77. One sample of solid propellant was sent to an overseas laboratory to test andconfirm the composition declared by Iraq for the solid propellant used in theAl Fatah rocket motor. The analysis confirmed Iraq's declaration. 78. Other analyses conducted outside Iraq on biological material recovered in Iraq are described in paragraphs 79 to 84 below.21S/2003/580 IV . Findings through inspection and analysis A. R-400 bombs 79. From 24 February to 16 March 2003, UNMOVIC biological teams carried out a series of inspections at Al Azziziyah firing range, located approximately 100 kmsouth-east of Baghdad, in order to observe Iraqi efforts to recover R-400 bombs andbomb pieces that Iraq claimed that they had filled with biological agents andsubsequently unilaterally destroyed in 1991. 80. Iraq made efforts to recover and account for the 157 R-400 bombs that it claimed were filled with biological agent and destroyed at Al Azziziyah firingrange. Iraq began the excavation and recovery of R-400 bombs and pieces on 19February; informed UNMOVIC on 22 February 2003, by letter, of initial findings;and supplied copies of videotapes taken during the period when inspectors were notpresent at the site. 81. Iraq provided a progress report on the excavation by a letter dated 25 February 2003. UNMOVIC personnel observed all excavation activity from 24 February until16 March 2003. Many of the items examined, including the intact bombs, wereexcavated at the site between 19 and 23 February 2003. The level of corrosion andsurface contamination of the fragments and the bombs indicated that those piecesmust have been buried for a considerable time period and suggested that Iraq's claimwas credible. 82. The recovered pieces were examined for identification markings. Samples were taken from base plates, from nosepieces with intact burster tube fittings andfrom intact but breached bombs. In addition, three intact bombs were drilled andsamples of their contents taken for analysis; of those, two contained liquid while thethird contained a clay-like material, probably due to the presence of an undetectedbreach in the casing. Where present, the bomb marking was in agreement with theinformation provided by Iraq, i.e., bilateral black paint stripes on nose cones, blackpaint stripes on body sections, black stencilled lettering \"R-400\" on a body section,large white circle with an Arabic letter in the centre. Some further work wassuggested to distinguish the excavated R-400 bombs from similar conventionalbombs, but that work could not be carried out before inspections were suspended. 83. The counting of base plates appears to provide the best way to clarify the number of bombs. However, because of the level of surface corrosion and the factthat in some items only the base plate rim was present, it was not possible toconfirm the presence or absence of a black stripe on all those items. 84. The excavations made from 19 February to 16 March 2003 unearthed the following items: eight bombs, 96 base plates, 60 nose cones and many fragments ofnose cones, tails and bomb bodies, accounting for a total of 104 R-400 bombs, inaddition to the 24 R-400 type bombs excavated by UNSCOM. The total number ofR-400 bombs accounted for at Al Azzizziyah is 128 (out of 157 declared destroyed). 85. Samples were obtained of the liquid contents of two R-400 bombs that were excavated by Iraq in February 2003 at Al Azzizziyah. The initial screeningtechniques for chemical or biological agents at BOMVIC gave negative results forall tested material. The biological tests were performed on the samples directlywithout pre-cleaning or concentration. Since the biological laboratory at BOMVIC22S/2003/580 did not have the capability to concentrate nucleic acids or to clean the samples from the quenching effect of potassium permanganate and formic acid, the samples of thetwo R-400 bombs filled with liquid agent were tested in outside laboratories. Theresults of that analysis indicated that both bombs contained DNA of virulent B. anthracis . No evidence of chemical agents or degradation products was found, nor was any evidence found of Cl. botulinum DNA or toxin. Additional tests are being conducted to perform single nucleotide polymorphisms to compare the type of B. anthracis found in bombs to the type declared and weaponized by Iraq; results are pending. In addition, the laboratory confirmed the presence of high levels ofmanganese and formic acid. Those two elements are an indicative verification ofIraq's chemical inactivation, as declared, of bomb contents with potassiumpermanganate and formaldehyde. B. Cluster munitions 86. UNMOVIC conducted a series of inspections in early February 2003 toexplore previous development of cluster munitions for chemical or biologicalagents. The Al Noaman factory and facilities were the focus of those inspections dueto their history of producing cluster munitions. During the inspections, informationwas obtained and hardware pertaining to cluster bombs and cluster warheads forrockets was found. Specifically, UNMOVIC inspectors found the body of a chemicalor biological submunition for the CB 250 cluster bomb and a 540 mm warheadwhich could be used with chemical agent-filled submunitions. In addition,components and moulds for other cluster bombs and rocket warheads wereexamined. 87. Examination of those munitions revealed that most if not all were manufactured prior to 1991. No evidence was found that suggested that they were ofmore recent origin. A complete assessment of them would have required additionalactivity in Iraq, including interviews to explore Iraqi explanations of their history,purpose and functioning. C. Warheads for rockets 88. The discovery by UNMOVIC of twelve 122 mm chemical warheads and rocketmotors in mid-January 2003 at the Ukhaidar ammunitions depot led to an Iraqideclaration regarding four additional warheads at Al Taji a few days later. X-rayexamination of those warheads at both locations showed that some contained anunknown liquid. Operations were undertaken to drill safely into the warheads andextract samples of the liquid contents for subsequent analysis. The contents weredetermined to be primarily water. 89. Other items were found that might be part of past programmes prohibited by the Council and would require further analysis, including various parts for 81 mm,107 mm and 200 mm rocket warheads and other munitions. In addition, a smallnumber of rocket warheads and artillery projectiles that appeared to be chemicalweapons munitions were found filled with high explosives. Plans to analyse thosecomponents in greater detail were interrupted by the withdrawal of UNMOVIC fromIraq.23S/2003/580 D. Remotely piloted vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles 90. Iraq provided a letter dated 19 March 2003, containing additional information on the specifications of all types of unmanned aerial vehicles in its inventory, lists ofpersonnel involved in the development of remotely piloted vehicles/unmanned aerialvehicles, flight test data and information related to the verification of its accounts ofits MiG-21 unmanned aerial vehicles project. Iraq declared a number of unmannedaerial vehicles in its disclosure of 8 December 2002 and its semi-annual monitoringdeclarations, including a converted L-29 aircraft and other smaller remotely pilotedvehicles with wingspans up to 5.52 m. Iraq declared and inspections have confirmedthat unmanned aerial vehicles capable of autonomous flight were developed andproduced. A remotely piloted vehicle with a wingspan of 7.45 m manufactured froman aircraft fuel tank was observed and examined during an inspection in earlyFebruary. In a letter dated 18 February 2003, Iraq amended its January 2003 semi-annual monitoring declaration, stating that a mistake in the wingspan had been made(the letter gave the wingspan as 7.40 m and not 4.40 m, which had previously beendeclared). In addition, other inconsistencies were identified with regard to thisunmanned aerial vehicle between Iraq's declaration and inspection findings. Thesignificance of the inaccuracies and the incomplete declarations cannot now bedetermined because UNMOVIC was not able to fully investigate the unmannedaerial vehicles programme. Without further onsite access to the actual unmannedaerial vehicles and other material, it is not possible to determine whether Iraq hadpursued the development of unmanned aerial vehicles for possible use in chemicaland biological weapons dissemination and whether they were capable of rangesgreater than 150 km or were designed for the legitimate purposes stated. E. Scud engine components and ingots 91. Iraq provided two letters concerning Scud engine components. The first letter,dated 25 February 2003, related to the submission of indigenously produced Scudengine components for analysis abroad. The second letter, dated 13 March 2003,related to the presentation of ingots resulting from the unilateral destruction ofcomponents of the Scud-B reverse-engineering efforts in 1991/1992. For the Scudengine components declared to have been indigenously produced, a comparison withthose obtained by UNSCOM for the imported Scud-B would possibly allow adetermination of the quality of the production and whether they were in fact ofindigenous origin. The components were inventoried and visually analysed byUNMOVIC experts. The remnants will need to be sent to laboratories for acomparative analysis with the imported Scud engines. As for the ingots, a largequantity, some 78 tons, was buried by Iraq at one of its missile facilities. Iraq hadstarted excavating the ingots and UNMOVIC had started inventorying andphotographing them on 15 March 2003. A selection of the ingots would need to bemade since UNMOVIC is specifically interested in the melted remnants of theimported turbopumps, of the rejected combustion chamber/nozzle assembly and ofthe production tools. The results of the analysis might help resolve the issue ofindigenous liquid-fuel engine production.24S/2003/580 F. Iraq's anthrax destruction study 92. On 26 February 2003, Iraq submitted a report describing a study it had initiated to try and show, through scientific means, that it had indeed disposed ofchemically inactivated B. anthracis (anthrax) agent, in the quantity it had declared, at the Al Hakam dump site in 1991. 93. On 1 March 2003, UNMOVIC and Iraqi experts discussed the report and the preliminary results of the analysis of soil from the dump site. On 19 March 2003,Iraq submitted another paper with more analytical results and indicated that it wouldattempt to perform a qualitative and quantitative chemical and biological analysis ofsoil samples taken in a defined grid pattern from an area of the dump site that hadbeen identified by UNSCOM in 1996. In support, Iraq also provided a report on thegeophysical characteristics of the sampling area. Given that 12 years had elapsedsince the material was stated to have been disposed of, such information would beessential to properly interpret the analytical results. 94. The analytical methods applied were the chemical analysis of the mineral content and bacteriological content of the soil. The data provided to UNMOVICfrom the relatively few samples for which the analyses had been completed at thattime, when compared to those of the relevant background samples, indicated: (a) A significantly higher concentration of manganese (Mn) and potassium oxide, which would support Iraq's explanation that it had chemically deactivated theagent by mixing it with potassium permanganate and disposing of the liquid at thedump site. That is also supported by the inverse relationship found between thenumber of spores and the amount of manganese in the samples; (b) A significantly higher quantity of total organic carbon and total nucleic acids, i.e., biological material; (c) The presence of an increased number of micro-organisms with bacteriological characteristics similar to B. anthracis . That bacteria would need further strain typing, which was not available in Iraq, to show whether they wereidentical to the B. anthracis strain used by Iraq for agent production or just genetically similar types of bacilli commonly found in the environment. It should benoted that analysis by an outside laboratory performed in 2002 on samples taken byUNSCOM from the same area using single nucleotide polymorphism analysis didreveal the presence of the strain of B. anthracis at the Al Hakam dump site. 95. While the analytical work performed by Iraq, in particular the observed qualitative and quantitative changes in mineral and biological characteristics in thesoil samples, appeared to be consistent with Iraqi declarations, a number ofproblems existed: (a) The study did not show conclusively that the environmental impact on the soil of the dumping sites and the resulting changes in mineral content weresolely caused by dumping of the declared amount of chemically inactivated biological agents \u2014 11,340 litres of agents and 303.6 kg of potassiumpermanganate; (b) The dumping area had also been used by Al Hakam personnel to dump unsuccessful production batches in years prior to 1991, which would make itdifficult to quantify only what was dumped in 1991.25S/2003/580 96. Overall, UNMOVIC assessed that, given the length of time that had elapsed since the agent was stated to have been dumped, the study could not provide aquantification of the amount of anthrax dumped in 1991 with the necessary degreeof certainty. For a final assessment of the matter of anthrax destruction at Al Hakam,information from other sources, such as interviews and documentary evidence,would be required. Although new information was acquired, that assessment did notresolve the question regarding the total quantity of anthrax produced and destroyedby Iraq. G. Iraq's VX destruction study 97. Towards the end of UNMOVIC's last period of inspections, Iraq madeconsiderable effort in terms of providing scientific data, documentation and furtherexplanations to try and resolve the outstanding issues concerning VX and VXprecursors. 98. Iraq provided nine letters on choline, choline in soil were outlined in a paper of9 February and analysis results for VX were reported on 3 March 2003, one dayafter technical discussions between UNMOVIC and Iraqi experts on the issue wereheld in Baghdad. 99. A final report entitled \"Estimation of VX degradation products in soil at the dump site in the Muthanna State Establishment\", prepared by the Soil and WaterDepartment of the Iraqi Atomic Energy Commission, was received by UNMOVICon 15 March 2003. The report contained the sampling scheme for the VX\"graveyard\"; proposed degradation routes in soil for VX; analytical procedures;mass balance equations; a report on VX quantification; and geological data. Asimilar report, entitled \"Estimation of choline degradation products in soil at theKasr Al-Ashig site\", describing the experimental procedure and quantification of theimmediate VX precursor choline, was received on 17 March 2003. 100. Based on quantifications of total organic carbon and nitrogen, the VX report concluded that between 30 per cent (carbon) and 39 per cent (nitrogen) of the 1.5tons of dumped VX could be accounted for. However, if quantification was based onphosphorous the calculated recovery was 63 per cent. The absence of the remainingquantity was attributed to evaporation. 101. A number of scientific problems were identified with the study. For example, it would be reasonable to assume that background levels of all the elements quantifiedthrough the study existed. Without a proper understanding of those levels and theirvariations, the composition of the background could not be verified and quantifiedso that it could be accounted for in the analytical results. Experts consulted byUNMOVIC also questioned how well the total depth of the spill was covered byIraq's sampling activity and whether an undisturbed sample core was collected.They stressed the need for background samples as well as the importance ofsampling the correct granulometric fraction of the soil. 102. UNMOVIC pointed out to Iraq that the primary concern with regard to VX was not simply the quantity unilaterally destroyed in 1991 but rather the retention ofprecursors, know-how and the extent of the development of the programme in 1990.26S/2003/580 Therefore, Iraq's sampling and quantification effort, even if successful, would not address all of the unresolved issues identified by UNMOVIC. 103. The study is, however, of interest and value for the information it provided on the geology of the soil at the site. That information would greatly assist any futuresampling missions. Further exploitation of the site might also help to determine thestability of the destroyed VX, which is also an issue of concern. That would requirean analysis of VX degradation products and a thorough characterization of the soil. 104. Iraq also made an effort to explain the outstanding quantities of precursors for VX. However, its proposal to quantify the amount of \"Iraqi choline\" unilaterallydestroyed in 1991 had the same problems as the quantification of VX. The proposalfrom Iraq, as it stood, needed significant modification \u2014 not the least of which wasthe requirement to try and quantify Iraqi choline itself at the dump site (the currentIraqi proposal was to quantify possible decomposition products of Iraqi choline).With modifications, it might be possible to gain some estimate of the quantitiesunilaterally destroyed, albeit with a considerable margin of error. 105. With respect to the other VX precursors, the new document given to UNMOVIC on phosphorous trichloride, in combination with results frominterviews, might be helpful in resolving the accounting issue for that chemical. Theinformation provided on thionyl chloride was not new and did not therefore changeUNMOVIC's assessment that accounting issues remained concerning that chemical. H. Mobile chemical and biological weapons production facilities 106. UNMOVIC has undertaken a variety of activities to investigate whethermobile chemical and biological weapons production facilities existed in Iraq. Thoseactivities were prompted by a number of considerations, as set out below. Information provided by supporting Governments on mobile facilities 107. UNMOVIC inspected a number of sites throughout Iraq based on intelligence information made available to it. In addition, other sites were inspected as a result offollow-up actions. Site inspections were aimed to investigate in detail theinfrastructural signature necessary for the alleged function of such sites, e.g., thepresence of suitable support services for chemical and biological weapons mobileproduction facilities during production runs. Inspection results and analysis ofdetailed forensic sampling of the facilities did not reveal evidence of any pastinvolvement of those sites in proscribed chemical and biological weapons mobileproduction activities. At several of the inspected sites, sea containers with recently(United Nations-registered) imported seed-processing equipment, with someresemblance to production equipment, were present. Information provided by Iraq on mobile facilities 108. In response to a request from UNMOVIC, Iraq provided two letters dated 5 and 15 March 2003. The first letter described the six different types of mobilefacilities in Iraq's inventory, the second letter provided more details, with a list of 39photographs and four videotapes. The photographs provided a reference base withwhich to judge the types of vehicle that could be converted to a mobile productionfacility without much difficulty. Iraq also provided details of two of the27S/2003/580 manufacturers involved in the construction and modification of such trucks, the Al Majid State Company and the Al Fao State Engineering Company. Examinationof the records of the two state companies identified by Iraq, as well as of othercompanies identified during inspections, could allow UNMOVIC to follow up anyspecific leads provided by supporting Governments. None of the types of mobilelaboratories described in the media in April/May 2003 as found in Iraq matched thedescription of mobile facilities provided by Iraq to UNMOVIC. Mobile facilities identified during inspections 109. During regular inspections, UNMOVIC identified a variety of mobile facilities at several sites. The outline and characteristics of those trucks were consistent withthe declared purposes, e.g., mobile food-testing laboratories and cooled transporttrucks. That was further supported by extensive forensic sampling of the interior andexterior of those trucks. No evidence of proscribed activities was observed duringrandom checks of transport trucks. In addition, another state company, theAl Bashair Company, was found to have been involved in the legitimate acquisitionof a mobile health laboratory. I. Information on suppliers provided by Iraq 110. Iraq was required to declare the import of dual-use items and supplyUNMOVIC with details as to their origin. However, Iraq's recent semi-annualmonitoring declarations, starting with the \"backlog\" of declarations since 1998supplied to UNMOVIC in October 2002, showed a trend of withholding pertinentinformation. The significance of the information withheld varied between thedifferent weapons disciplines. It could be argued, for example, that the declaredchemical imports would play only a very minor role in any potential chemicalweapons programme since they consisted mostly of valves and diaphragms withonly a moderate resistance to corrosion. The biological imports were of a slightlymore significant kind, and included the import of a dozen autoclaves, half a dozencentrifuges and a number of laminar flow cabinets. 111. Missile imports, however, were more substantial and could have contributed significantly to any missile development programme. One example was theimportation of 380 Volga engines that Iraq planned to use in the production of theAl Samoud 2 missile, a missile system UNMOVIC later determined to be prohibitedsince its range exceeded 150 km. In its declaration of 7 December 2002, Iraqdeclared that it had imported 131 such engines but failed to supply any informationabout their origin (suppliers, exporting countries) until inspectors observed 231 suchengines at an Al Samoud production facility. 112. A trend that was especially pronounced in the missile area (but to a lesser extent also present in the biological and chemical fields) was the use of the term\"local market\" to classify the import of some very sophisticated pieces ofequipment, including a dozen high-capacity load cells (used, for example, tomeasure the thrust of missile engines or motors) and a number of pieces ofequipment that could be used in the manufacture of advanced missile motors.UNMOVIC came to understand that Iraq used the term \"local market\" when an Iraqiimport company imported a commodity and then sold or transferred it to a28S/2003/580 government facility, which suggested that Iraq was trying to conceal the extent of its import activities and to preserve its importing networks. V . Destruction activities * A. Al Samoud 2 missiles 113. Iraq provided information, inter alia, on its backlog of semi-annual monitoringdeclarations on its Al Samoud 2 missile programme. Some declared flight tests hadexceeded 150 km in range, the limit set by the Security Council. In February 2003,UNMOVIC convened an international panel of experts which assessed that themissile was capable of exceeding the permitted range, while an assessment in thecase of the Al Fatah missile could not be made, pending additional information fromIraq. Subsequently, UNMOVIC informed Iraq that under Security Council resolution687 (1991) it was a proscribed system and accordingly should be destroyed. TheExecutive Chairman conveyed that decision to Iraq in a letter dated 21 February2003 (which was also shared with Council members). Iraq accepted that decision,and destruction of the missiles and associated items commenced on 1 March 2003under UNMOVIC supervision. Destruction activities continued up to 17 March2003. All required destruction had not been completed by that time. 114. The destruction of the missiles and other major components took place on the site of the Taji technical battalion, located inside the Taji military camp, about 30km north of Baghdad. The Al Samoud 2 missiles, warheads, launchers, commandand control vehicles and other major components of missiles in production wereprepared by the Iraqis and brought daily to that site for destruction under thesupervision of UNMOVIC inspectors. Each item was crushed with a heavybulldozer, then placed in nearby pits and covered with concrete. In the case of thelaunchers, only the launch tables and missile cradles, which were specific to theAl Samoud 2, were destroyed; the basic vehicles were not destroyed. For thecommand and control vehicles, only the software relating to Al Samoud 2 wasdestroyed. Details of the items presented each day for destruction were recorded bythe inspectors, including serial numbers and any UNMOVIC tags and seals that hadpreviously been applied. Photographs were taken of items before and afterdestruction, and also of the pits containing the remnants. The total number ofAl Samoud 2 missiles is based on Iraq's statements and is consistent withdocumentary evidence provided by Iraq and with inspectors' findings. 115. As of 17 March 2003, two thirds of the Al Samoud 2 missiles declared by Iraq to have been deployed had been destroyed, as well as one third of the associatedlogistics and support equipment. A summary of the balance of Al Samoud 2 missilesand associated equipment as of 17 March is as follows: __________________ * For a description of the material destroyed in the period 1991 to 1998, see appendix I.29S/2003/580 Balance of declared Al Samoud 2 missiles and associated equipment ItemInventoried to be destroyed Destroyed 1-17 March 2003 Remaining to be destroyed Missiles deployed 75 50 25 Training missiles 16 16 0 Missiles in final assembly 6 6 0Warheads deployed 70 32 38Training warheads 16 16 0Warheads in final assembly 6 6 0Warheads in manufacture 20 20 0 Launchers 9 3 6 Command and control vehicles 9 3 6Engines 331 5 326 116. In accordance with the Commission's instructions, Al Samoud 2 production had been frozen at all sites known to be involved in the programme, and whiledestruction was occurring at Al Taji, teams of inspectors visited those sites for theverification and destruction of associated items, including drawings, productionfixtures and manufactured parts. That process had been completed at Al Wazariyah,Al Samoud Factory and Al Fatah Factory by 18 March 2003 but had not yetcommenced at Al Khadimiyah, Al Qudis and Al Fedaa Hydraulic Factory. No liquidpropellant had been presented for destruction. 117. On 8 March 2003, Iraq presented to UNMOVIC for its assessment a conceptual design for a new missile to replace the Al Samoud 2. The new designwas similar to the Al Samoud 2 but incorporated changes that Iraq believed wouldmake the missile conform to the 150 km range limit set by Security Councilresolution 687 (1991). B. Propellant casting chambers 118. During an inspection on 7 January 2003 of the Al Mamoun site, UNMOVICinspectors observed two large propellant casting chambers. Iraq declared that thosecasting chambers had originally been acquired for the Badr 2000 project. That was aproscribed project, and although UNSCOM had supervised the destruction of thetwo casting chambers in 1991 Iraq had managed to refurbish them for use in theircurrent solid propellant missile projects. Iraq had shortened the chambers' length inthe process, but nonetheless the international panel of experts convened byUNMOVIC in February 2003 concluded that they could still be used to producerocket motors for missiles capable of ranges greater than 150 km. UNMOVICinformed Iraq that the casting chambers remained proscribed and were to bedestroyed. The destruction was carried out under UNMOVIC supervision from 1 to6 March 2003. It was achieved by cutting each into at least 16 pieces and buryingthe remnants in a pit which was then filled with concrete.30S/2003/580 C. 155 mm shells filled with mustard gas 119. The destruction of the chemical weapons agent mustard gas, which had started at the end of February, was completed in March 2003. Under UNMOVICsupervision, Iraq destroyed the 155 mm shells and the mustard gas contained inthem. The shells found in 1997 were stored at a declared location \u2014 the formerMuthanna State Establishment. In total, there were 14 shells, containingapproximately 49 litres of the agent \u2014 four of them had been earlier emptied andsampled by UNSCOM. The agent was destroyed by chemical reaction and the emptyshells with explosives. Samples taken from the shells showed that mustard gasproduced over 15 years ago was still of high quality \u2014 97 per cent purity. 120. All samples of mustard gas stored in the Commission's chemical laboratory were also destroyed the day before withdrawal of staff and no quantity of the liveagent was left behind in the BOMVIC's offices. D. Thiodiglycol 121. A small quantity of thiodiglycol (500 ml) was destroyed under UNMOVICsupervision in January 2003. That prohibited mustard gas precursor was found at theAl Basil Jadriya complex along with some other dual-use chemicals (also oflaboratory quantity) by the chemical inspection team. According to the Iraqi siterepresentatives, the chemical had been left over by a previous occupant of thesite \u2014 the Scientific Research Center \u2014 and had not been used by the Al Basilcomplex for any purpose. The entire quantity of the chemical was destroyed on-siteby chemical reaction and combustion. Inspection activities following the finding didnot reveal evidence of any research being done at the site regarding the chemicalagent mustard gas or the precursor itself. E. 122 mm chemical warheads 122. An UNMOVIC inspection team found 12 undeclared 122 mm chemicalwarheads and motors at the Al Ukhaidar ammunition depot (11 of them wereunfilled and 1 filled with water). Iraq notified the Commission on 20 January 2003that four more warheads had been found at the Al Taji ammunition depot. InFebruary 2003, an UNMOVIC team discovered an additional two undeclared 122mm chemical warheads at the same depot (one of the six warheads discovered at theAl Taji depot was filled with liquid that was subsequently identified as water). Intotal, 18 chemical warheads were tagged by UMOVIC for destruction. F. Chemical equipment 123. In its submission of the backlog of semi-annual declarations in October 2002,Iraq declared that it had transferred one piece of equipment, previously destroyed in1997, from the storage area to the phenol factory of Fallujah II. It further declaredthat five other items of proscribed equipment from the former Al Muthana weaponsplants had been installed in the military factory Al Qaa Qaa. In its declaration of7 December 2002, Iraq had declared that an additional piece of destroyed equipment(a heat exchanger) had been installed in the chlorine factory of Fallujah II.31S/2003/580 Following technical discussions on 9 February 2003, Iraq submitted a letter to UNMOVIC explaining the use of destroyed equipment in Fallujah II and declaredthat a third piece of previously destroyed equipment had been installed at the phenolfactory (a pump). UNMOVIC conducted inspections to verify the declarations andclarify the issue. It decided that Iraq should destroy those three pieces of equipmentat Al Fallujah II and five pieces of equipment at Al Qaa Qaa under UNMOVICsupervision. However, that destruction was not carried out prior to the withdrawal ofthe inspectors. G. Destruction of biological material 124. The biological team observed and verified the destruction of 244.6 kg ofdeclared but expired growth media. The biological team also observed and verifiedthe destruction of 40 vials of expired toxin standards, with original seals, used infood testing and analysis. In both cases, the Iraqi authorities initiated the destructionrequest. VI. Withdrawal of UNMOVIC from Iraq 125. On the evening of 16 March 2003, following a United States warning to theUnited Nations to withdraw its personnel from Iraq, UNMOVIC informed BOMVICof the likelihood of withdrawal. It instructed personnel that certain preparatoryactivities should be initiated, taking into consideration the eight-hour timedifference between Iraq and New York. 126. On 17 March 2003, limited inspections were conducted, as well as a planned interview, while BOMVIC staff started packing non-essential equipment, shreddingdocuments, clearing desks and safes, and selecting records and equipment forevacuation. In the evening (local Baghdad time), the withdrawal instruction wasgiven following the meeting of the Security Council at which the Secretary-Generalinformed the members of his decision to withdraw and suspend all United Nationsoperations in Iraq. The withdrawal was to take place by air from Baghdad toLarnaca the next day,18 March 2003. 127. Overnight, the hard drives of computers were erased and all network drives were disconnected from the secure local area network for removal from Iraq. Anumber of servers were also packed as well as communication equipment, such assatellite and secure telephones. Sensitive documents were also prepared for removal. 128. On 18 March 2003, the BOMVIC offices were locked and sealed, including the offices at the Al Rasheed airbase where the Commission had stationed itshelicopters. All UNMOVIC vehicles were parked inside the United Nations CanalHotel compound. The move of UNMOVIC personnel from the Mosul regional officeto Baghdad was completed in the morning and all 111 UNMOVIC and IAEA staff,together with other United Nations staff, were evacuated in a highly organized wayto Larnaca, using three flights. Concurrent with that withdrawal, the three MI-8helicopters, with all crew members, flew to the Syrian Arab Republic. The fiveBell 212 helicopters and their crew had been withdrawn by their companies on 16March, also via the Syrian Arab Republic. The Iraqi authorities were helpful duringthe withdrawal.32S/2003/580 129. The UNMOVIC staff remained for a few days in Larnaca to finalize inspection reports and working papers and complete inventories. The administrative andlogistics tasks associated with the repatriation of staff were initiated, and by 29March 2003 most of the staff had been repatriated. A. Status of Cyprus field office 130. The Cyprus field office has reduced its staff to three international staff and fivelocal staff, and has closed out the financial accounts for Larnaca and Baghdad. Thestaff has organized the equipment brought out from Iraq during the withdrawal. Inaddition, several surveillance units are being kept in Larnaca, which UNMOVICintended to install at Iraqi facilities for monitoring purposes. B. Status of Bahrain field office 131. Although the Government of Bahrain had extended the 1991 agreement forUNMOVIC to use the field office in Bahrain to support inspection operations,UNMOVIC staged all its activities through Larnaca in Cyprus. Before the expirationof the current agreement with the Government of Bahrain on 18 May 2003,UNMOVIC obtained the Government's confirmation that the agreement would beextended on a month-to-month basis. Two local employees are maintaining theoffice. VII. Other issues A. Declassification of the \"clusters\" document 132. As mentioned in previous quarterly reports, the Commission had beenpreparing an internal working document of clusters of unresolved disarmamentissues as part of the process under paragraph 7 of resolution 1284 (1999), to identifykey remaining disarmament tasks for Iraq to complete. 133. The first stage of the process had been the creation of an inventory of all unresolved disarmament issues. In the identification of those issues, a number ofsources, such as the UNSCOM (S/1999/94) and Amorim (S/1999/356) reports,UNSCOM inspection reports and various declarations and documents of Iraq,including those from the Haidar Farm, were consulted. For the period from theestablishment of UNMOVIC until the resumption of inspections in November 2002,reliance had to be placed on such sources as overhead imagery, published material,suppliers and intelligence. Account was subsequently taken of the informationsupplied by Iraq in its declaration of 7 December 2002 and other documents itprovided prior to and after the resumption of inspections. The results of thoseinspections and UNMOVIC's re-baselining activities constituted another importantsource of information. 134. The working document with clusters of UDIs had been designed to combine individual unresolved disarmament issues already identified so as to assess theirinterrelationships and significance. The document was submitted to the College ofCommissioners in February 2003 for its comment and revised accordingly.33S/2003/580 135. In response to requests from several members of the Security Council, the document was declassified and made available on 6 March 2003. B. Draft work programme 136. In paragraph 7 of its resolution 1284 (1999), the Security Council requiredUNMOVIC to draw up a work programme for the discharge of its mandate. Thework programme was to be submitted for the approval of the Council and todescribe how the Commission intended to implement the reinforced system ofongoing monitoring and verification, and to present the list of key remainingdisarmament tasks to be completed by Iraq. 137. The terms of resolution 1284 (1999) gave UNMOVIC up to 60 days after the start of work to prepare the draft work programme. In response to a request byseveral Council members, UNMOVIC agreed to submit the draft work programmebefore the deadline. Prior to the submission of the draft work programme to theCouncil, the draft was sent to the members of the College of Commissioners fortheir comments and advice. Taking into account the comments of the College, thedraft was revised and then sent to the Security Council on 17 March 2003. A copywas also provided to Iraq. On 19 March 2003, the Chairman provided the SecurityCouncil with an oral briefing on the work programme. Since armed activities wereinitiated in Iraq on 19 March and UNMOVIC inspections were suspended, theCouncil took no action on the draft work programme. C. Staffing 138. Since the suspension of activities in Iraq, all UNMOVIC inspectors andsupport staff who had been in Iraq have been repatriated. As at the end of May 2003,90 of those staff remain under UNMOVIC contracts that are due to expire inearly/mid-June 2003. UNMOVIC core staff in the Professional grades atHeadquarters comprise 76 persons (of 31 nationalities); 14 members of the staff arewomen. 139. Regrettably, in March 2003, an inspector, Jian Xing Yu (China), died as a result of injuries sustained in a vehicle accident. The Commission extends itscondolences to the family of Mr. Yu. D. Training 140. UNMOVIC conducted two training courses during March and April 2003. Onemultidisciplinary course on the inspection and monitoring of dual-use productionequipment in the biological and chemical areas was held in New York from 13 to 21March 2003; there were 13 participants from nine countries. The second course,devoted to monitoring the non-production of biological warfare agents at civilianfacilities, was conducted in Brazil from 31 March to 11 April; there were 10participants from nine countries. The Commission is grateful to the Government ofBrazil for its support of UNMOVIC training activities. 141. UNMOVIC started its training activities for its inspectors in Iraq in July 2000, since when it has conducted seven basic training courses. The total number of34S/2003/580 persons trained through those courses is 380. UNMOVIC has also conducted 15 follow-up training courses for personnel who completed a basic training course;more than 250 participants have attended follow-up courses, which were devotedmostly to the development of practical inspection skills and inspectors' abilities tomonitor dual-use materials and equipment in Iraq. Throughout the process, theviews of course participants were surveyed and the scope and content of the trainingcourses adjusted. The current composition of the roster (354 persons from 55countries) is provided in detail in appendix II. E. Export/import 142. From the period 1 March 2003 to 22 May 2003, UNMOVIC received from theOffice of the Iraq Programme 1,814 contracts under the Oil for Food Programme.The contracts were reviewed and assessed by technical experts against the criteriacontained in the Goods Review List (see S/2002/515) and its accompanyingamendment (see resolution 1454 (2002)). VIII. UNMOVIC readiness 143. At the request of the President of the Council, the Executive Chairman briefedthe Council on 22 April 2003 on the practical matter of how UNMOVIC shouldmaintain a readiness to resume work in Iraq should the Council so decide. Thatinformation is elaborated below. 144. On 22 May 2003, the Council adopted resolution 1483 (2003), in which it reaffirmed the importance of the disarmament of Iraqi weapons of mass destructionand of eventual confirmation of that disarmament. It also reaffirmed the duty of Iraqto meet its disarmament obligations, and invited the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates to keep the Council informed of their activities in that regard, and underlinedthe intention of the Council to revisit the mandates of UNMOVIC and IAEA. A. Effect of resolution 1483 (2003) 145. At the time when UNMOVIC inspections in Iraq were suspended, they werebased upon and guided in particular by Security Council resolutions 687 (1991),1284 (1999) and 1441 (2002). It is evident that the premises upon which thoseresolutions were based have been substantially altered with the occupation of Iraqand that the resolutions themselves have in part become inoperable. For instance, theprovision in resolution 1284 (1999) enabling the Security Council to suspendsanctions is evidently obsolete since the Council has already lifted the sanctions. 146. It may be taken as a general rule that where two resolutions adopted by the Security Council cannot be reconciled the later resolution prevails over andsupersedes the earlier. To the extent, however, that earlier resolutions can bereconciled with a newer resolution, they remain in force and are applicable. It isconcluded, accordingly, that the Council is retaining UNMOVIC as a subsidiaryorgan until any other decision is taken. It is also concluded that while Iraq remainsobliged to disarm the Security Council is looking to the United Kingdom and theUnited States to keep the Council informed about their activities. By implication, it35S/2003/580 follows that their engagement in the disarmament process has the acceptance and support of the Council. Nothing is said in resolution 1483 (2003) about ongoingmonitoring and verification. Since that was an important part of earlier resolutionsand it does not seem incompatible with the new resolution, it would seem reasonableto conclude that the Council has not intended to rescind it. B. Equipment 147. In respect of inspection and support equipment, UNMOVIC is better preparedto perform its mandated mission at the present time than when the inspectors firstarrived in Iraq in November 2002. Initial reports that the UNMOVIC premises in theCanal Hotel were completely looted turned out to be false. All of UNMOVIC's 34local employees survived the war. On their own initiative, several of them workedwith coalition forces to secure BOMVIC and its equipment \u2014 even to the point ofdriving with coalition forces to attempt to recover stolen United Nations vehicles.They recovered two vehicles. 148. The local staff was able to report that 10 rooms on the third floor of BOMVIC were not entered during the looting, including the chemical and biologicallaboratories, the communications rooms and workshops, the IAEA room, themedical facility and several administrative offices. In addition, five of the largeequipment containers in the parking area were not entered and the mobile chemicallaboratory was intact. 149. According to inventories compiled by the inspectors, equipment in the secured rooms and containers at BOMVIC includes chemical agent monitors, digital still andvideo cameras, Global Positioning System devices, voice recorders and equipmentin the laboratories for performing chemical and biological analysis, including gaschromatographs. In addition, there is sufficient equipment to re-establish a computernetwork, satellite and VHF communications in a few days, as well as protective suitsand gas masks and other protective gear, and sufficient computers, printers andmonitors to start operations. 150. Although the looters apparently left nearly all the significant inspection equipment, they did take 62 UNMOVIC vehicles, several computers, printers andmonitors and a large amount of furniture. If it were decided that UNMOVIC shouldrestart operations in Iraq, that common equipment would be available from theUnited Nations Logistics Base in Brindisi, Italy, and could be flown in on shortnotice. A fixed-wing aircraft could be obtained on fairly short notice; helicopters,however, might take longer to obtain (as was the case in 2002). C. Staff 151. As of the end of May 2003, UNMOVIC has 70 inspectors from the roster stillon contract until early/mid-June 2003. They are currently on leave of absence andcould be recalled for inspection work at any time. After June, if some activities wereto be resumed, UNMOVIC would depend on the reactivation of those and otherinspectors on the roster, as was done in November 2002. Such reactivation wouldtake about four weeks from the time a decision was taken to resume operations inIraq.36S/2003/580 152. In New York, some staff have not extended their contracts in the current situation, but to date most headquarters-based UNMOVIC personnel have remainedon board. They have been completing the work arising from previous inspections,both analysis and assessment of data. 153. About 30 staff members in New York \u2014 mainly the Operations and Analysis Divisions \u2014 could form the core of the first inspection teams if the Council were todecide that UNMOVIC was to resume work in Iraq. Later, they could be replaced bystaff from the roster. Within two weeks after a decision on resumption of work, theywould be able to start the necessary activities. The laboratories for screeningchemical and biological samples could be reactivated within the same time frame.From the some 90 vehicles available for use by the inspectors, only 16 appear toremain for use after some repairs; 33 local staff are currently under contract until theend of June 2003. 154. Despite the losses, BOMVIC could probably go back into limited operations within two weeks after a return of staff. Thus, UNMOVIC would be ready to resumework in Iraq at the service of the Council. 155. As a result of the experience gained in the field in terms of inspection work and the infrastructure built in connection with such inspections, both in the analysisand logistic areas, UNMOVIC is currently capable of forming teams of inspectorswith experience and up-to-date knowledge on a vast range of dual-use sites in Iraqand the capabilities of those sites, including material and equipment that existedon-site until March 2003. UNMOVIC maintains a large database of sites, materialand equipment of dual-use nature previously subject to monitoring. That databaseand archives of more than one million pages includes inspection reports, interviewtestimony, supplier information, and documents and other materials from Iraq, andcontinues to be updated. 156. At the UNMOVIC premises in the Canal Hotel in Baghdad, there is a laboratory-screening capability backed with an arrangement with well recognizedreference laboratories in six countries. UNMOVIC also has experience withchemical and biological laboratory equipment, which could be moved within areasonable time to virtually any location within Iraq for screening activities. Theequipment is still available. The UNMOVIC infrastructure, logistics and equipmentremains in place for searches, verification activities, interviews and monitoringmissions, with a large number of inspectors trained in site inspection and searcheswith the ability to recognize dual-use equipment and processes. UNMOVIC retainsthe logistical capability of supporting an average of five to eight inspection teamsper day, visiting 10 sites per day. 157. The personnel of UNMOVIC who have experience in Iraq or have served on its headquarters staff also have a great deal of knowledge of the Iraqi individualsinvolved in proscribed programmes and also in declared permitted activities atuniversities, research institutions, industrial and military organizations. 158. UNMOVIC also interacted with many Governments in the area of export control, in particular in finding practical solutions to such matters as definingmaterial as dual-use and finding the appropriate balance between the non-proliferation goals and legitimate commerce. The experience gained in that respectby UNMOVIC will be invaluable if it is decided to maintain an export/importmonitoring mechanism for certain exports to Iraq.37S/2003/580 IX. College of Commissioners 159. The College of Commissioners held its thirteenth regular plenary session at United Nations Headquarters on 28 May 2003. As on previous occasions, in additionto the members of the College, observers from IAEA and the Organization for theProhibition of Chemical Weapons attended. 160. At the outset, the Executive Chairman made a brief statement introducing his draft report to the Security Council and highlighting various matters, such as theinspection conducted in Iraq and the recent adoption of Security Council resolution1483 (2003) on Iraq. 161. Presentations were also made by UNMOVIC staff on different aspects of inspection activities, covering: (a) An overview of UNMOVIC operations since resuming inspections;(b) Destruction of materials in the missile area;(c) The location, analysis and disposal of munitions by UNMOVIC;(d) Chemical and biological sampling and analysis;(e) Iraq's remotely piloted vehicles/unmanned aerial vehicles programme;(f) Iraq's mobile facilities. One Commissioner provided additional information concerning Iraq's mobile facilities in a paper entitled \"Iraqi mobile biological warfare agent productionplants\". 162. The College welcomed the Executive Chairman's introductory statement and the presentations, which were considered useful and informative. The view wasexpressed that a compendium encompassing the knowledge and experience gainedby UNMOVIC and its predecessor over the years would be useful as an objectiverecord. In the course of the discussions, questions were raised about the effect ofresolution 1483 (2003) on the UNMOVIC mandate. The Executive Chairmanobserved that even though some of its mandated functions were no longer operable,UNMOVIC continued to be a subsidiary organ of the Security Council until theCouncil decided otherwise. The College noted the experience gained by andavailable within UNMOVIC and the usefulness of those assets being maintained forthe benefit of non-proliferation in the future. 163. The College recommended that in revisiting the UNMOVIC mandate and considering the process of the eventual confirmation of the disarmament of Iraq asenvisaged in resolution 1483 (2003), the Security Council take into accountUNMOVIC experience and expertise in inspections and ongoing monitoring. 164. While taking note of the intention of the Executive Chairman to retire from his post, the College paid tribute to Dr. Blix's leadership in the establishment of acredible and highly professional mechanism of inspections and monitoring in Iraq,as requested by the Security Council. His dedication, professionalism andindependence were highly appreciated.38S/2003/580 165. It was decided to hold the next session of the College on 21 August 2003 in New York. 166. In accordance with paragraph 5 of resolution 1284 (1999), the Commissioners were consulted on the contents of the present report. Notes aThe Commission's 12 previous reports were removal or rendering harmless of proscribed items and materials in Iraq, 1991 to 1998a A. Ballistic missiles 1. Destruction of items declared during the period 1991-1993 1. The major part of Iraq's proscribed missile items and capabilities that remained after the 1991 Gulf War were destroyed by Iraq unilaterally and withoutinternational supervision. A significant portion of Iraq's ballistic missile productioncapabilities was also destroyed or heavily damaged during the Gulf War. 2. UNSCOM supervised Iraq's destruction of its declared proscribed missile capabilities and materials remaining after the Gulf War from 1991 to 1993. Theitems destroyed included (see S/1999/94): 48 proscribed missiles and 50 warheads 20 tons of proscribed missile fuel and 52 tons of oxidizer Five combat mobile launchers, one training mobile launcher, indigenously produced launching equipment and two associated launch control vehicles,three prototype launchers and 56 fixed launch sites About 80 pieces of critical equipment for the production of proscribed solid propellants, 11 relevant buildings and raw materials Some 75 pieces of components acquired for both 350 mm and 1,000 mm guns 2. Destruction of additional proscribed items identified by UNSCOM after 1993 3. By early 1995, UNSCOM had accumulated evidence that not all proscribed items had been declared by Iraq and that the ongoing involvement of retained dual-use items in proscribed activities had been concealed. Although the items inquestion were not weapons per se, they included an additional six units ofproduction equipment, flow-forming machines, vacuum furnaces, a turbo pump teststand and a balancing machine. They were designated for destruction, which wascompleted in July 1995 despite strong protest from Iraq. However, in November1995 Iraq finally acknowledged that the equipment destroyed had indeed beenspecifically procured for and used in proscribed activities. 4. UNSCOM identified other specific instances of Iraq's activities after 1991 that were in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions. For example, ashipment of proscribed missile gyroscopes destined for Iraq was intercepted en routeto Iraq in 1995 (see S/1996/848). 5. All proscribed items identified after 1993 represented certain portions of ballistic missile production capabilities and relevant missile components but notoperational missiles. aThe Commission's \"clusters\" document, which was declassified on 6 March 2003, in part addresses what remained unaccounted for with respect to Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programmes.40S/2003/580 B. Chemical weapons 1. Destruction of declared items during the period 1991-1994 6. In the chemical weapons area, a significant portion of Iraq's production capabilities were destroyed or damaged through aerial bombardment in 1991.Sizeable quantities of chemical weapons and their components, including emptymunitions and precursor chemicals, were also destroyed by Iraq unilaterally andwithout international supervision. 7. A significant number of remaining weapons declared by Iraq, as well as related subsystems and components, were destroyed under UNSCOM supervision in theperiod from 1991 to 1994, including: 38,537 filled and unfilled chemical munitions 690 tons of chemical warfare agents More than 3,000 tons of precursor chemicals More than 100 pieces of chemical weapons production equipment 2. Destruction of additional items identified by UNSCOM after 1994 8. In 1996, UNSCOM found new evidence of chemical production and analytical equipment and precursor chemicals acquired for chemical weapons purposes stillremaining in Iraq. Many of those items had been exempted from destruction by theCommission in 1995 on the basis of false Iraqi declarations as to their past use orintended purpose. In 1997, UNSCOM designated for destruction and supervised thedisposal of the following newly identified items and materials (see S/1996/848): 325 pieces of production equipment (of those, possession of 120 pieces was only disclosed by Iraq in August 1997); 125 pieces of analytical instruments; 275 tons of precursor chemicals. 9. In addition, UNSCOM discovered that in 1990 many pieces of analytical instruments had been removed by Iraq from Kuwait for use in its chemical weaponsprogramme. At the request of the Government of Kuwait, 91 items of analyticalequipment from Kuwait City University were returned by UNSCOM to Kuwait in1997. 10. In addition to discoveries in the missile area, findings in the chemical area comprised hidden production capabilities but not weapons themselves, with theexception of a dozen artillery shells filled with mustard gas found in the period1996-1997 at a former storage site. However, it should be noted that more chemicalweapons production equipment was identified and destroyed in 1997 than in theperiod from 1991 to 1994 (325 and 100 pieces of equipment, respectively).41S/2003/580 C. Biological weapons 1. Period 1991-1995 11. From 1991 to 1994, Iraq consistently denied that it had had an offensive biological warfare programme. Subsequently, no biological weapons or any of theircomponents and production capabilities were declared and destroyed by Iraq underUNSCOM supervision. In July 1995, Iraq finally admitted to having had anoffensive biological weapons programme. However, weaponization was still denied.The weaponization and the broader scope of the programme were disclosed only inAugust 1995 after the departure from Iraq of Lieutenant-General Hussein Kamel.However, Iraq continued to maintain that all biological munitions and biologicalwarfare agents produced had been destroyed unilaterally in 1991 along with theassociated documentation. 2. Destruction of equipment and materials after 1995 12. In 1996, the Al Hakam facility, including buildings, equipment and materialstherein, was destroyed by Iraq under UNSCOM supervision through demolition. Inaddition, the equipment from Al Manal and Al Safah sites, two other facilities thathad been used in the proscribed programme, was transported to Al Hakam anddestroyed there. The air handling system for high containment at Al Manal wasinactivated. The growth media procured by Iraq for the proscribed activities wasalso destroyed (see S/1997/774).42S/2003/580 Appendix II Composition of the roster of trained inspectors as of May 2003 CountryHeadquarters inspectorsaOutside inspectorsbTotal Algeria 4 4 Argentina 1 13 14A u s t r a l i a 22 12 3Austria 2 11 13Bangladesh 7 7Belarus 3 3 Belgium 3 3 Brazil 1 3 4Bulgaria 1 1Burkina Faso 1 1Cambodia 1 1Canada 4 4 C h i l e 134 China 3 9 12Croatia 2 2Denmark 1 1Ethiopia 7 7Finland 1 9 10 France 5 30 35 Germany 10 10Greece 1 1Hungary 5 5Ireland 2 2Italy 4 4 J a p a n 213 Jordan 6 6Kenya 1 1Lebanon 1 1Mexico 2 2Morocco 1 1 Nepal 3 3 Netherlands 1 1New Zealand 1 1Nigeria 2 2Norway 5 5Peru 3 343S/2003/580 CountryHeadquarters inspectorsaOutside inspectorsbTotal P o l a n d 246 Qatar 1 1 Republic of Korea 9 9 Republic of Moldova 1 1Romania 2 12 14Russian Federation 3 20 23Serbia and Montenegro 1 1S l o v a k i a 178 Spain 1 1 Sweden 1 5 6Switzerland 2 2Thailand 5 5Tunisia 1 1Turkey 4 4 U k r a i n e 167 United Kingdom 3 11 14United States 7 39 46Zambia 4 4Zimbabwe 1 1 Grand total (55 countries) 40 314 354 a28 inspectors served in Iraq. b106 inspectors "}
