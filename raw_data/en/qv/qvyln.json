The experts consider how traditional knowledge is taught and learned and address the cultural importance of different subsistence practices using natural elements such as seaweed (Gitga'a), pine mushrooms (Tsimshian), and salmon (Tlingit). Several contributors discuss the extent to which national and regional programs of resource management need to include models of TEK in their planning and execution. This volume highlights the different ways of seeing and engaging with the natural world and underscores the need to acknowledge and honor the ways that indigenous peoples have done so for generations. The contributors include Kimberly Linkous Brown, Caroline Butler, Helen Clifton, John Corsiglia, David Griffith, Stephen J. Langdon, James McGoodwin, Charles R. Menzies, Paul Nadasdy, Gloria Snively, and Nancy Turner. "}
