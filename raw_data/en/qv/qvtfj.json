Acupuncture points are tailored according to the patient's signs and symptoms and possess specific functions to improve and harmonize the body. Due to congenital, dietary, or lifestyle reasons, the flow of Qi (\"chee,\" the body's vital life force energy) becomes disrupted and does not flow freely as it should. Acupuncture reestablishes the balance by improving the flow of Qi and blood and stimulating sensory receptors. These sensory receptors transmit impulses to the brain to initiate the release of neurotransmitters and endorphins which helps ease pain, promote healing, and improve immune function. Acupuncture can treat various health concerns and strengthen your overall health and well-being on a mental, spiritual, and physical level. Herbal Medicine Herbal medicine has been an important component of Chinese Medicine for millennia and continues to be effective in treating many health conditions to this day ranging from common colds to digestive disorders to painful menstruation to extreme pain. These herbal formulas have been passed down by generations of distinguished herbalists and consist of only natural ingredients such as plants, minerals, and other organic material that can be found in the natural world. Commonly used herbs include cinnamon bark, ginger root, mandarin orange peels, ginseng, mint, and fennel. Acupuncture and herbal medicine are often used together to reinforce one another and are tailored to the individual patient based on their disease, diagnosis, and underlying constitution to encompass and treat the patient as a whole. Facial Acupuncture & Cupping New Patient Consult & Acupuncture: $90 Returning Visits: $75 Facial rejuvenation commonly referred to as \"cosmetic acupuncture\" or \"acupuncture facelift,\" is the use of ultra-thin acupuncture needles on certain points of the face to affect the deeper dermis layers of the skin and help promote a structural change from the inside out. As we age, our collagen production decreases dramitcally leading to fine lines, wrinkles, and loss in skin elasticity. With facial needling, we are creating a \"microtrauma\" to encourage increased blood flow and collagen production to the area. Promotes brighter, hydrated, glowing complexion Firms and tones skin Relaxes facial muscles Reduces swelling and inflammation Softens the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation, acne, acne scars (Crow's feet, frown forehead lines, laugh lines) Regular and consistent treatments are key to noticable results. Depending on age, level of physical health, and expectations, one to three treatments a week are optimal. Cupping Cupping: $50 Duration: 15-30 minutes Dating back to the 4th century AD, cupping is a traditional Chinese therapy that involves the use of pressurized cups to suction certain areas of the body in order to move stagnant blood or fluid. The suction lifts all the different muscle layers apart to relieve any tension hiding beneath them. Not only does it improve blood circulation, cupping relieves deep to superficial muscle tension, promotes cell repair, and forms new connective tissues and blood vessels. Cups are placed on the skin for 15-20 minutes and often moved around for more stimulation. Some \"bruising\" or marks may occur after cupping and represents the stagnation and toxins in the body. Cupping has grown in popularity among celebrities and athletes due to its amazing benefits with immediate relief. Tui Na Massage 30 minute: $65 Tui Na (\"twee-naw\") translated as \"pushing and squeezing,\" is a form of bodywork massage that has been traced back to ancient China 2300 BC and was the top five modalities of treatment at the time. Based on Traditional Chinese Medicine theory of energy and channels throughout the body, Tui Na utilizes these channels and its points to harmonize the body's vital energy Qi through stretches, pressure points, and joint rotations. Some techniques and strokes in Tui Na are much like those used in relaxing Swedish or Shiatsu massage, such as gliding, kneading, rocking, pulling, friction, and rolling. Tui Na goes deeper than just the bones, joints, and muscles, but by moving the Qi through the channels that have been blocked by tension, lifestyle, and poor health, it restores the balance of the body on a physiological and emotional level. Like Thai and Shiatsu massage, Tui Na is traditionally practiced fully clothed. Patients should wear loose and comfortable clothing to ensure that joints can go through full range of motion. Gua Sha // Scraping Gua Sha: $50 Duration: 15-30 minutes Gua Sha is a therapy treatment that has been used in Asia for centuries. It involves the use of a flat-edged tool with gentle but consistent pressure to \"scrape\" the skin to improve blood circulation. The benefits of Gua Sha include reduction of inflammation, treatment of chronic pain, muscle pain, improve immunity, and even fighting off colds. Like cupping, some marks may occur after to represent the exit of toxins and movement of blood in the area. "}
