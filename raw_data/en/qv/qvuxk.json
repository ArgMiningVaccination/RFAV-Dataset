The most effective treatments for [insomnia](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/insomnia)are behavioral techniques that reduce anxiety, including anxiety about falling asleep, and allow the [body's natural cycles](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/circadian-rhythm)to be recalibrated. The most common treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which researchers have found to be more useful than medication, with rates of success as high as 80 percent. Are there specific medications for sleep problems? There are many medications, both over-the-counter and prescription that treat sleep problems. Supplements such as melatonin are popular and may help, though there is little evidence that it is more effective than a placebo. Prescription medications such as zolpidem are sometimes prescribed. Are there natural treatments for sleep problems? There are many natural treatments for everyday sleep problems. Reducing blue-light emitting screens, setting a regular bedtime, regular exercise, reducing caffeine and nicotine consumption, and keeping the bedroom dark and cool at night are all lifestyle changes that can help those who struggle with sleep but may not reach the level of an insomnia diagnosis. What's the difference between having trouble falling asleep and insomnia? Life events, stress, and anxiety can lead to sleepless nights for everyone from time to time. To be diagnosed with insomnia, a patient must experience trouble falling asleep, trouble remaining asleep, waking up too early, or non-restorative sleep at least three nights per week for at least one month. Sleep problems affect one-third to one-half of the population, while chronic insomnia affects about 10 to 15 percent of people. About Psychiatrists, meds and Psychiatric Nurses.
