In a nutshell, it's a preparation created in a medical lab designed to protect a person against a specific disease. It contains the same germs that cause the disease, but they've been weakened so that you don't get sick when you take it. Instead, it stimulates your body to produce antibodies that build immunity to that disease without you ever having to get sick! A brief bit of history: Back in 1796, something monumental occurred in the medical world. It was the development of the Smallpox vaccine. Developed by Edward Jenner, it was so effective, that the deadly disease became completely eradicated worldwide. As a result, this vaccine is no longer given because it is no longer necessary. This elimination of this disease is seen as one of the greatest international public health achievements. And rightly so! We at Medemerge play our role in providing immunity against the diseases that affect the world today. We remain current with administering all routine vaccinations for adult, adolescent, and childhood vaccinations for age 3 and above as recommended by [The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/vpd/index.html). Some of those include: - Influenza Vaccine (protects against the common flu) - The MMR Vaccine (protects against measles, mumps, and rubella) - The Tdap Vaccine (protects against tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) - The HPV Vaccine (protects against the human papillomavirus) - Others To learn more about vaccination and whether or not you & your family are current, please make an appointment with our friendly Medemerge staff today.
