Animal studies show risk and human studies not available or neither animal nor human studies done. D: Use in LIFE-THREATENING emergencies when no safer drug available. Positive evidence of human fetal risk. X: Do not use in pregnancy. Risks involved outweigh potential benefits. Safer alternatives exist. NA: Information not available. Pharmacology Mechanism of Action Third-generation oral cephalosporin with broad activity against gram-negative bacteria; by binding to 1 or more penicillin-binding proteins, it arrests bacterial cell-wall synthesis and inhibits bacterial growth Absorption Bioavailability: 40-50% Average plasma concentration: (single 200 mg-suspension); 3-8 hr (single 400 mg-capsule) Food reduces absorption following administration of the capsule by ~15% based on AUC and 25% based on peak plasma concentrations Distribution Distributed widely throughout body and reaches therapeutic concentration in most tissues and body fluids, including synovial, pericardial, bound: 65% Elimination Half-life: 3-4 hr Excretion: Urine (50% as unchanged drug), feces (10%) Administration Oral Suspension Preparation Tap bottle several times to loosen powder contents prior to reconstitution Add ~1/2 of the total amount of water for reconstitution and shake well (refer to prescribing information for specific volumes) Add remainder of water and shake well Oral Administration Administer orally once or twice daily depending on indication Do not substitute tablet or capsule for the chewable tablets or suspension in the treatment of otitis media Chewable tablets must be chewed or crushed before swallowing Storage Capsules, chewable tablets, or tablets: Store at 20-25\u00b0C (68-77\u00b0F) Unused suspension: Store at 20-25\u00b0C (68-77\u00b0F) Reconstituted suspension - Store at room temperature, or under refrigeration, without significant loss of potency for up to 14 days - Keep tightly closed - Shake well before using - Discard unused portion after 14 days Images |BRAND||FORM.||UNIT First DataBank, Inc.
