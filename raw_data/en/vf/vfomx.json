SPIKEVAX contains the active ingredient Elasomeran. SPIKEVAX is a vaccine which stimulates the body's natural defences (immune system). The vaccine works by causing the body to produce protection (antibodies) against the virus that causes COVID-19 disease. SPIKEVAX uses a substance called messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) to carry instructions to cells in the body that are used to make the spike protein that is also on the virus. The cells then make antibodies against the spike protein to help fight off the virus. This will help to protect you against COVID-19 disease. SPIKEVAX is used to prevent COVID-19 disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is given to individuals aged 6 months and older. 2. What should I know before I am given SPIKEVAX? Warnings You should not be given SPIKEVAX if: - you are allergic to Elasomeran or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Always check the ingredients to make sure you can be given this vaccine. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before vaccination if you: - Have previously had a severe, life-threatening allergic reaction after any other vaccine injection or after you were given SPIKEVAX in the past. - Have a very weak or poorly functioning immune system. - Have ever fainted following any needle injection. - Have a bleeding disorder. - Have a high fever or severe infection; however, you can have your vaccination if you have a mild fever or upper airway infection like a cold. - Have any serious illness. - Have anxiety related to injections. Anxiety and stress related reactions can occur, however, they will be temporary. - Take any medicines for any other condition. There is an increased risk for myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle) and pericarditis (inflammation of the lining outside the heart) after vaccination with SPIKEVAX. These conditions can develop within just a few days after vaccination, and have primarily occurred within two weeks. They are seen more often after the second vaccination, and more often occurred in younger men; however, they are also seen in a number of women. Following vaccination, you should be alert to signs of myocarditis and pericarditis, such as breathlessness, a noticeably rapid, strong, or irregular heartbeat and chest pain. Additionally, non-specific signs such as feeling very tired, nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, dizziness or fainting, fluid retention and cough have been reported in some recipients with myocarditis or pericarditis. Seek immediate medical attention should these occur. During treatment, you may be at risk of developing certain side effects. It is important you understand these risks and how to monitor for them. See additional information under [Section 6. Are there any side effects?](#s6) Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) flare-ups A few cases of capillary leak syndrome flare-ups (causing fluid leakage from small blood vessels (capillaries) resulting in rapid swelling of the arms and legs, sudden weight gain and feeling faint, low blood pressure) have been reported following vaccination with SPIKEVAX. If you have previously had episodes of CLS, talk to a doctor before you are given SPIKEVAX. If you have a weakened immune system (immunocompromised) If you have a weakened immune system, you may receive a third dose of SPIKEVAX. The efficacy of SPIKEVAX even after a third dose may be lower in people who have weaker immune systems. In these cases, you should continue to maintain physical precautions such as mask wearing and social distancing to help prevent COVID-19. In addition, your close contacts should be vaccinated as appropriate. Discuss appropriate individual recommendations with your doctor. Pregnancy and breastfeeding SPIKEVAX can be used during pregnancy. A large amount of information from pregnant women vaccinated with SPIKEVAX during the second and third trimester has not shown negative effects on the pregnancy or the newborn baby. While information on effects on pregnancy or the newborn baby after vaccination during the first trimester is limited, no change to the risk for miscarriage has been seen. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are pregnant or intend to become pregnant. SPIKEVAX can be given during breastfeeding. A large amount of information from breastfeeding women vaccinated with SPIKEVAX has not shown negative effects in breastfed babies. Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed. Use in Children SPIKEVAX is not recommended for children aged under 6 months. 3. What if I am taking other medicines? Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking any other medicines, including any medicines, vitamins, or supplements that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket, or health food shop. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have recently received any other vaccine. Check with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure about what medicines, vitamins or supplements you are taking and if these affect SPIKEVAX. 4. How will I be given SPIKEVAX? How much SPIKEVAX is given. - SPIKEVAX will be given to you as two injections. It is recommended to administer the second dose of SPIKEVAX 28 days after the first dose to complete the vaccination course. - If you have a weakened immune system, you may receive a third dose of SPIKEVAX at least 28 days after the second dose, as a third full dose will help your immune system get a better response. - A single booster dose of SPIKEVAX may be given at least 6 months after the second dose in individuals aged 18 years and above. - A single booster dose of SPIKEVAX may be given to you if you have completed your full course of your first vaccination (usually two doses) with another approved COVID-19 vaccine. - Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will inject the vaccine into a muscle (intramuscular injection) in your upper arm or your thigh. - After each injection of the vaccine, your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse will watch over you for at least 15 minutes to monitor for signs of an allergic reaction. If you miss an appointment for your 2nd or 3rd dose of SPIKEVAX If you miss an appointment, arrange another visit as soon as possible with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse. If you miss a scheduled injection, you may not be fully protected against COVID-19 disease. If you use too much SPIKEVAX - As SPIKEVAX is given under the close supervision of a doctor, pharmacist, or nurse it is unlikely that you will be given too much. - If you are concerned that you have been given too much SPIKEVAX, tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse immediately. You should do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. 5. What should I know about being given SPIKEVAX? As with any vaccine, the 2-dose vaccination course of SPIKEVAX may not completely protect all those who receive it and it is not known how long you will be protected. Things you should know You may not be fully protected against COVID-19 disease until fourteen days after your second dose. You may not be protected if you only receive one dose, so a second dose is important. Driving or using machines Do not drive or use machines if you are feeling unwell after vaccination. Wait until any effects of the vaccine have worn off before you drive or use machines. Looking after your vaccine Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse is responsible for storing this vaccine and disposing of any unused product correctly. 6. Are there any side effects?
