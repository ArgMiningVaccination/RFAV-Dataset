Recruitment status was: Not yet recruiting First Posted : January 15, 2021 Last Update Posted : January 15, 2021 - Study Details [Tabular View](/ct2/show/record/NCT04712279) [No a classical antiparasitic and anti-scabies agent, has demonstrated antiviral activity for a variety of viruses including chikungunya virus, zyka virus and dengue virus and was tested as a potentially effective for COVID-19. Although ivermectin demonstrated potent in vitro action by reducing viral load by 5000x after 48 hours of incubation, simultaneous pharmacokinetics simulations suggested that the minimum effective concentrations would be unfeasible to be reached within safety range (EC-50 = 2 Micromol). However, despite the theoretical unfeasible concentrations to be achieved, preliminary observational yet well-structured studies followed by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) demonstrated ivermectin efficacy when combined with hydroxychloroquine, doxycycline or azithromycin, which was corroborated by a recent systematic review and metanalysis. In common, a dose-response effect for effectiveness was observed, and no adverse effects was reported at any dose between 0.2mg/kg/day and 1.0mg/kg/day. Based on the scientific rationale combined with the preliminary evidence, ivermectin has sufficient evidence to be tested in higher doses in a RCT for COVID-19. The investigators propose to test ivermectin at high doses as a treatment for patients recently diagnosed with COVID-19, aiming to explore the possible protective role of high-dose ivermectin in SARS-CoV-2 infection in terms of reduction of clinic and virologic disease duration, and prevention of oxygen use, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, death, and post-COVID persisting Date Date :||March q.d. for 05 - World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale [0 to 10; 0 = uninfected; 10 = death] [ Time Frame: Day 14 ]Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Progression Scale [0 to 10; 0 = uninfected; 10 = death] - World Health Organization (WHO) COVID=19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement [1 to 8; 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation on activities; 8 = death] [Time Frame: Day 7] Day 7 ]Treatment efficacy of high-dose Ivermectin relative to placebo arm as assessed by World Health Organization (WHO) COVID=19 Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement [1 to 8; 1 = not hospitalized, no limitation on activities; 8 = death] - Time-to-recovery [ Time Frame: Day 28 ]Recovery is defined as the first day on which the subject satisfies category one from the COVID ordinal scale (defined in Section 5.1): (1) Not hospitalized, no limitations on activities.
