The Committee RECOMMENDS: Chapter 1 1. That smoking not be permitted in enclosed places, including office, factory, shop or other work sites, shopping centres, restaurants, theatres, hotels and sportingvenues. 2. That in respect of offices, shops, restaurants etc., outdoor or separately ventilated indoor spaces be made available for smokers, but that staff not be compelled to work in, or service, these areas. 3. That nicotine transdermal patches (nicotine patches) be listed in the Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits; but that they only be prescribed as part of a structuredsmoking cessation program. Chapter 2 4. That the provisions of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 relating to incidental or accidental broadcast or publication of tobacco advertisements bestrictly monitored and enforced by the Department of Human Services andHealth. 5. That the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 be amended to remove the provision for the exemption of publication of tobacco advertisements inassociation with specified sporting and cultural events of internationalsignificance and that this be phased in by the year 2000. 6. That the Commonwealth Government establish a national health promotion foundation or other appropriate national body to provide an alternative source ofsponsorship funding to that provided by tobacco companies for major sportingand cultural events. 7. That the current testing procedures for cigarette yields be reviewed by an appropriate independent body to determine whether these procedures accuratelyreflect the actual levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide inhaled by smokers;and that the printed material contained on cigarette packs on tar, nicotine andcarbon monoxide yield levels reflects this information. 8. That, while the Committee favours the listing of nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking as a Schedule 7 poison by the National Drugs and PoisonsSchedule Committee, it believes that further investigation of the implications ofthis proposal should be undertaken by the Council of Australian Governmentsand the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council.xii9. That the National Health and Medical Research Council assess the health effects of tobacco product additives, including determining whether additives potentiatethe effects of nicotine. 10. That a list of the ingredients added to tobacco products be provided annually to the Commonwealth Government, on a confidential basis, by those tobaccocompanies whose products are available for sale in Australia. 11. That a list of the ingredients in tobacco products, and their effects, be distributed (in an appropriate form) with all tobacco products sold in Australia. 12. That the National Health and Medical Research Council appoint a sub-committee to review the current weight-based excise system. 13. That the Commonwealth Government investigate the implications of withdrawing tobacco products from the list of duty-free goods. Chapter 3 14. That national education programs be developed for primary and secondary school students and that these programs be regularly revised; and that theseprograms be based on the most recent research and evidence of the socio-economic, environmental, behavioural and personal factors identified asencouraging the take-up of tobacco use by young people, and the continuing useof tobacco by young people. The Committee further recommends that theseprograms include information on the dangers of passive smoking, particularly foryoung people. 15. That primary and secondary teachers, who will teach or are teaching health courses that include anti-smoking units, be funded by the CommonwealthGovernment as part of the National Drug Strategy to attend teacher educationand in-service training sessions. 16. That school-based smoking prevention programs be encouraged and expanded; and that they be taught each year from at least Year 4 (about 9 years of age) tothe end of secondary schooling. 17. That no smoking be permitted (including smoking by students, staff, parents and visitors) on any school premises; and that students who are found in breach ofthis be counselled, and supported through drug education and 'Quit' smokingprograms. 18. That additional research be undertaken into the efficacy of generic packaging of tobacco products as a means of addressing the problem of juvenile smoking. 19. That comprehensive restrictions on the size, placement and format of point-of- sale advertising of tobacco products, similar to those applying in New SouthWales, be applied in all States and Territories.xiii20. That the distribution of non tobacco-related products associated with the sale of tobacco products be prohibited. 21. That the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments ensure that there are regular real increases in levels of excise duties and business franchise fees leviedon tobacco products; and that the revenue from these taxation increases bedirected to tobacco control and health promotion activities. 22. That tobacco products be removed from the basket of goods used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. 23. That the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products be 18 years in all States and Territories; and that the States and Territories investigate thefeasibility of making it an offence for persons under the age of 18 years topurchase tobacco products. 24. That an appropriate form of proof-of-age identification be automatically required for young people purchasing cigarettes. 25. That there be a reduction in the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products and that: as an interim measure, tobacco products be isolated from other products for sale in all outlets currently selling tobacco products; and in the longer term, those retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products be restricted to licensed premises and to tobacconists; and that this be phased into minimise any disruption to small business. 26. That the licensing systems in all States and Territories provide for the suspension or revocation of a licence where retail outlets sell tobacco products to minors. 27. That State and Territory Governments, in co-operation with the appropriate retail trade associations, expand their education programs directed at retailers. 28. That, as it is virtually impossible to prevent access by children to cigarette vending machines, these types of vending machines be prohibited in all States and Territories. 29. That State, Territory and Local Governments increase the level of funding and personnel devoted to the enforcement of laws restricting the supply of tobaccoproducts to minors; and that increased resources be devoted to the prosecution ofretailers that contravene such laws. 30. That State and Territory Governments institute routine systems of random compliance checks to monitor the sale of tobacco products to minors.xiv31. That the Commonwealth Government encourage the States and Territories to improve the effectiveness of their enforcement and monitoring programs; andthat: as part of their monitoring system the States and Territories provide statistics annually to the Commonwealth on the number of complaints andprosecutions against retailers selling cigarettes to minors; and the States and Territories run a publicity campaign that informs the public of the appropriate bodies to which they can direct complaints regarding the saleof tobacco products to minors. 32. That a system of substantial fines be introduced in all States and Territories to discourage the sale of tobacco products to minors. Chapter 4 33. That strategies continue to be developed to address the special needs of 'at risk' groups in the community, such as lower socio-economic groups, to reduce theincidence of smoking in those groups. 34. That funding continue to be allocated by the Commonwealth Government for the development of appropriate programs and strategies to address the problem oftobacco use for 'at risk' groups in the community. 35. That strategies, sensitive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural values, be implemented to address the problem of tobacco use in Aboriginal and Islandercommunities, and that these strategies include: close liaison with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-based health organisations, especially the Aboriginal Health Services; and the dissemination of culturally appropriate information on tobacco use throughout Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 36. That further research be conducted to examine the problem of tobacco use by Aboriginal people in urban areas. 37. That funding be provided by the Commonwealth Government for culturally appropriate programs and strategies to address the problem of tobacco use inAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, as part of a broader healthstrategy. 38. That strategies, sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and values of people from non-English speaking backgrounds, be implemented to address the problem oftobacco use in these communities.xv39. That funding be provided by the Commonwealth Government for programs to address the problem of tobacco use amongst people from non-English speakingbackgrounds, including older people.xvixviiINTRODUCTION Terms of Reference The matter was referred to the Committee on 8 June 1994 for inquiry and report. The terms of reference are to inquire into:The tobacco industry and the costs of tobacco-related illness, with particular reference to: (a) a review of the current level of regulation of the manufacture, advertising, promotion and sale of tobacco products; and (b) an exploration of the costs of tobacco-related illness to the Australian community and a review of existing mechanisms for recouping thosecosts. The reference was advertised in the national press on 24 September 1994.The closing date for submissions was originally 11 November 1994; however, given the high level of interest expressed, this deadline was extended. Seventy-onesubmissions and a large amount of supporting evidence were received. A list ofsubmissions is at Appendix 1. The Committee held five public hearings, taking evidence from a range of organisations and individuals, including the Commonwealth Department of HumanServices and Health, several State and Territory Departments of Health, medicalspecialists, a range of health groups and representatives of the tobacco industry. A listof hearings is at Appendix 2. A list of witnesses who gave evidence at these publichearings is at Appendix 3. The inquiry coincided with the publication of major reports on the tobacco industry, and this fact structured the Committee's terms of reference. In June 1994 the IndustryCommission issued a comprehensive report on the tobacco growing andmanufacturing industries. The report reviewed factors affecting the current and futureperformance of the industries and their relationship to the efficiency of the economy ingeneral, including trends in local and global markets, the structure andcompetitiveness of the industry and issues relating to the efficiency of the industries. 1 In September 1994, the Prices Surveillance Authority presented a report on cigarettepricing in Australia. 2 The Committee decided not to examine these issues relating to the tobacco industry. 1 Industry Commission, The Tobacco Growing and Manufacturing Industries , AGPS, Canberra, 1994, p.1. 2 Prices Surveillance Authority, Inquiry into the Cigarettes Declaration , Report No. 52, September 1994.xviiiA substantial amount of published information is available on tobacco, its health effects, the history of its use, smoking prevalence, and the operation of the industry.Consequently, the Committee agreed that, while it would address all the terms ofreference, it would concentrate on a number of issues of particular concern, namely: the health effects of tobacco use and the costs to the community of tobacco- related illness; the problem of adolescent smoking, and measures to prevent it, including education, information and access strategies which would limit the uptake ofsmoking by adolescents; advertising and promotion of tobacco products; the regulation of tar and nicotine levels; taxation arrangements; and tobacco use amongst specific groups, for example Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people from non-English speaking backgrounds, and certainsocio-economic and occupational groups. Acknowledgments The Committee expresses its appreciation to those who made written submissions tothe inquiry and who co-operated with the Committee by giving public evidence.1CHAPTER 1 TOBACCO USE HEALTH EFFECTS AND COST TO THE COMMUNITY 1.1 This chapter discusses the health effects of tobacco use, including the health consequences of both active and passive smoking. The chapter also reviews a numberof studies that have attempted to quantify the costs of tobacco-related illness inAustralia. Finally, the chapter looks at the various ways the costs of tobacco-relatedillnesses may be recouped. Introduction 1.2 Smoking has been identified as the largest single preventable agent of illness and death in developed countries.1 One study has estimated that smoking already kills 2 million people a year in developed countries, half in middle age and half in old age;this number will increase to 3 million annually by the year 2025. 2 Over the next 30 years the annual number of deaths from tobacco use worldwide will increase fromthree million in 1995 to more than 10 million. 1.3 In Australia the human cost of tobacco use is also substantial. In 1992, there were an estimated 18 920 deaths from tobacco-related disease. This figurerepresented 15.3 per cent of all deaths from all causes in all age groups, and 22 percent of deaths among 35-69 year olds. 3 As the table below indicates, there were an estimated 7 265 deaths due to tobacco-related cardiovascular disease, 6 644 deathsdue to smoking- induced cancers and 4 437 deaths from tobacco-related chronicobstructive pulmonary disease. Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of drug-causeddeaths and hospital morbidity in Australia. 4 1.4 The magnitude of the numbers of tobacco-related deaths was starkly put in evidence to the Committee by the Australian Council on Smoking and Health(ACOSH) who stated in their submission that tobacco kills more people in Australiathan the 'total number killed by alcohol, drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, road crashes,rail crashes, air crashes, poisoning, drowning, fires, falls, lightning, electrocutions,snakes, spiders and sharks'. 5 1 Submission No.42, p.1 (National Heart Foundation). 2 R.Peto, 'Smoking and Death: the Past 40 Years and the Next 40', British Medical Journal , Vol.309, 8 October 1994, p.937. 3 Submission No.71, pp.i, 3 (AIHW).4 Hospital morbidity refers to morbidity (illness) measured through hospital use.5 Submission No.29, p.8 (ACOSH).2Table 1 Estimated deaths and hospital episodes for tobacco-related disease in 1992 Proportion of Proportion of Tobacco Hospital Tobacco Deaths Estimated related episodes Estimated related from all number of hospital for all number of deaths causes hospital episodes causes Tobacco related disease deaths (%) (%) episodes (%) (%) Lung cancer 5 063 26.8 4.1 8 879 9.0 0.3 All tobacco related cancer 6 644 35.1 5.4 16 843 17.1 0.6 Coronary heart disease 4 528 23.9 3.7 24 339 24.7 0.8 All tobacco related cardiovascular disease 7 265 38.4 5.9 44 569 45.3 1.5 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 4 437 23.5 3.6 20 078 20.4 0.7 All other tobacco related disease 574 3.0 0.5 16 882 17.2 0.6 All tobacco-related disease 18 920 100.0 15.3 98 372 100.0 3.4 All disease 123 651 2 913 538 Source: Submission No. 71, p.3 (AIHW). Active Smoking 1.5 The adverse health effects of active smoking have been extensively documented by respected bodies such as the Royal College of Physicians, the UnitedStates Surgeon General and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. 6 Some 57 000 scientific articles have been published that have examined the link betweencigarette smoking and disease. Smoking is now identified as a major cause of heart 6 See, for example, Royal College of Physicians, Smoking and Health Now , Pitman, London 1971; US Public Health Service, Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service , Rockville, MD, US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1964; US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Smoking and Health: A Report to the Surgeon General , US Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1979; US Department of Health and Human Services, Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking-25 Years of Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General , Rockville, MD, US Department of Health and Human Services, 1989; International Agency for Research on Cancer, Evaluation of the Carcinogenic Risk of Chemicals to Humans: Tobacco Smoking , IARC Monograph Series No. 38, 1986.3disease, stroke, several different forms of cancer, and a wide variety of other health problems.7 Evidence also indicates that tobacco companies in the United States and the United Kingdom have been aware of the health risks of tobacco use for more than30 years, yet have publicly denied that such risks existed. 8 1.6 A recent study, conducted for the Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health (DHS&H), undertook an extensive review of studies examiningthe health effects of active cigarette smoking. The study identified 19 medicalconditions where there is sufficient evidence of a causal relationship with activecigarette smoking. These conditions include various forms of cancer (including lung,oropharyngeal, oesophageal, pancreatic, laryngeal and renal cancer), ischaemic heartdisease, pulmonary circulatory diseases, heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructivepulmonary disease, tobacco abuse, respiratory carcinoma in situ, cardiacdysrhythmias, atherosclerosis, peptic ulcer, low birthweight, and fire injuries. 9 1.7 Recent research has shown that about half of all regular cigarette smokers will eventually die as a result of smoking. The evidence, based on a 40-year study ofBritish male doctors, found that the risks of smoking had been seriouslyunderestimated. Data from the first 20 years of the study into British doctors(1951-71) indicated that the death rate in middle age (defined as ages 35-69) from allcauses was twice as great in smokers as in non-smokers. However, during the secondhalf of the 40-year follow-up (1971-91), the death rate from all causes in middle agesmokers was three times that of non-smokers. 10 7 US Department of Health and Human Services, Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of Progress : A Report of the Surgeon General , Rockville, MD, 1989. 8 For instance, internal documents from the Brown and Williamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W) and its parent company, BAT Industries (formerly British American Tobacco Company) of the UnitedKingdom indicate that in the 1960s, results from tobacco industry laboratories supported theconclusions of the scientific community that determined that smoking was causally related to lungcancer and probably related to heart disease. In the 1970s, B&W and BAT undertook a large researchcampaign to identify and remove toxic compounds identified in tobacco smoke. However, their researchindicated that because of the large number of such compounds in tobacco smoke that it would bedifficult to remove them all. Publicly, the industry continued to deny that smoking had been provenharmful to health. See S. Glantz et al., 'Looking Through a Keyhole at the Tobacco Industry: The Brown and Williamson Documents', Journal of the American Medical Association , Vol.27(3), 19 July 1995, p.221. 9 D. R.

Doll et al., 'Mortality in Relation to Smoking: 40 Years' Observations on Male British Doctors', British Medical Journal , Vol. 309, 8 October 1994.4Tobacco use and cardiovascular disease 1.8 Cigarette smoking is one of the major modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Cardiovascular disease is an umbrella term describinga variety of disease processes related to the functioning of the heart and thecirculatory system. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) statedthat there is evidence that smoking influences some of the mechanisms responsiblefor coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and stroke. Experimental datahave implicated nicotine and carbon monoxide, which are products of cigarettesmoking, as having a role in some of the processes leading to coronary heartdisease. 11 A recent Australian study examined the effect of smoking on the incidence of coronary heart disease in the population aged 35-69 years. The study found thatmale smokers were 2.9 times more likely than non-smoking males of the same age tosuffer a first coronary event. The corresponding risk for female smokers was3.5 times that of non-smoking females. The risk of sudden cardiac death is also twoto four times greater for smokers than for non-smokers. 12 1.9 Studies have demonstrated a clear relationship between smoking and coronary heart disease with up to a five-fold increase in the risk of fatal coronary heart diseaseamong heavy smokers. The risk of coronary heart disease is greatly increased whencigarette smoking is combined with other risk factors, particularly hypertension,family history and high blood cholesterol. 1.10 There is also strong evidence of risk of stroke among smokers. One study indicated that the overall risk of stroke for smokers was 1.5 times that of non-smokers. In addition, the risk for smokers increased with the number of cigarettessmoked per day. Smoking is considered the most important preventable risk factor foratherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease in males and females. 13 Tobacco use and cancer 1.11 As noted previously, tobacco use has been linked with several forms of cancers. The International Agency for Research on Cancer working group on tobaccosmoking has stated that 'there is sufficient evidence that tobacco smoke iscarcinogenic to humans'. 14 This increased risk is due to the range of carcinogenic chemicals released on combustion of the tobacco. The working group indicated thatcancer of the respiratory tract, upper digestive tract, bladder, renal pelvis andpancreas are causally related to smoking. 15 Table 1 indicates that lung cancer was 11 Submission No.71, pp.1-2 (AIHW). 12 Cited in ibid., p.2. 13 Herosclerotic peripheral vascular disease occurs when blockages within the blood vessels prevent proper blood circulation. See ibid., p.2. 14 Cited in ibid., p.3. 15 ibid.5responsible for 27 per cent of tobacco-related deaths in Australia in 1992, while all tobacco-related cancers were responsible for 35 per cent of tobacco-related deaths inthat year. 1.12 A recent study has assessed the risk of cancer for smokers and non-smokers based on Australian and overseas studies. The study found that the risk of cancers forsmokers was between 1.6 and 13 times that of non-smokers, depending on the type of cancer. In the case of lung cancer, smokers had a 13 times greater risk of developing the disease than non-smokers. (see Table 2). 16 It was estimated that in 1992 there were 6 644 deaths and 16 843 hospital episodes due to these smoking inducedcancers (see Table 1). Table 2 The excess risk of smokers over non-smokers for selected cancers Cancer site Excess risk of 1.13 The Committee considers that on the basis of the scientific and medical studies undertaken both in Australia and overseas active smoking poses a number of healthrisks. The Committee believes that the link between smoking and a number ofdiseases and conditions, particularly cardiovascular disease, a number of cancers andlung disease, have been well documented and recognised by numerous health andmedical organisations throughout the world. 16 ibid., p.4.6Addictive nature of nicotine 1.14 The Committee received a range of different views on the issue of smoking and addiction and the extent to which nicotine is an addictive drug. The TobaccoInstitute of Australia, representing the tobacco industry's view, described addiction asexhibiting four characteristics: intoxication, physical dependence, tolerance and one'slife being dominated by the substance in question. The Institute argued that these fourfactors 'are the traditional criteria for 'addiction', and states that many doctors andlay persons' would agree. 17 The Institute argued that 'none of these criteria are satisfied by cigarette smoking',18 and the tobacco industry argues that cigarette smoking is more properly characterised as a 'habit', which some people may havedifficulty in giving up. 19 1.15 In elaborating on their reasons for adopting the view that tobacco is not addictive the Institute stated that: Smokers do not get 'intoxicated'. Smokers are able to carry out difficult tasks while smoking. Alleged physical dependence is not demonstratedby medically significant withdrawal symptoms as with the trulyaddictive drugs. Reported withdrawal symptoms or irritability, forexample, are similar to the type of psychological symptoms that peoplemay experience when they stop doing any enjoyable activity... Withtruly addictive drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, we believe thataddicts increase their level of drug uptake throughout their drug takinglives. This rarely happens with smokers who typically remain atconstant levels throughout their smoking life. Therefore, we believe thatthere is no 'tolerance' in the scientific sense. Smokers' lives are notdominated by the need to smoke. This is evidenced by the fact thatmany people in Australia have given up smoking. 20 1.16 Other evidence strongly suggests, however, that cigarettes and other tobacco products are addictive. A report by the US Surgeon General on nicotine addictionconcluded that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting; nicotine is thedrug in tobacco that causes addiction; and the pharmacologic and behaviouralprocesses that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those which determineaddiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine. 21 17 Submission No. 43, Appendix 2, p.6 (Tobacco Institute of Australia). 18 See Submission No.43, p.19 (Tobacco Institute of Australia); and Appendix 2 of the submission, p.6. See also Submission No. 44, Appendix 6 (Philip Morris). 19 Submission No.43, Appendix 2, p. 8 (Tobacco Institute of Australia).20 ibid., Appendix 2, pp. 6-7. 21 US Department of Health and Human Services, The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction-A Report of the Surgeon General , Rockville, MD, 1988, p. 15.71.17 Nicotine has also been recognised as an addictive substance by such organisations as the American Medical Association, the American PsychiatricAssociation, the American Psychological Association, and the Medical ResearchCouncil in the United Kingdom. 22 In evidence to the Committee, a representative of the National Heart Foundation stated that 'there is an overwhelming consensus inmedical circles and scientific circles, outside the tobacco industry - of course - thatcigarette smoking is addictive'. 23 1.18 The Surgeon General's report concluded that tobacco meets the criteria as a pharmacologically addicting substance based on the criteria for drug dependencedeveloped by the World Health Organisation. The primary criteria for drugdependence are that highly controlled or compulsive patterns of drug-taking occur;that a psychoactive or mood-altering drug is ingested by use of the substance and isinvolved in the resulting patterns of behaviour, and that the drug is capable offunctioning as a reinforcer that can directly strengthen behaviour leading to furtherdrug ingestion. 24 Additional criteria for drug abuse include stereotypic patterns of use, use despite harmful effects, relapse following abstinence and recurrent drugcravings. Dependence-producing drugs also often produce tolerance (ie. diminishedresponsiveness to the effects of the drug), physical dependence and pleasant(euphoriant) effects. 25 1.19 The primary criteria cited above are sufficient to define drug dependence. Highly controlled or compulsive use indicates that drug-seeking and drug-takingbehaviour is driven by strong, often irresistible, urges. 26 It can persist despite a desire to quit or even repeated attempts to quit. Such behaviour is also referred to as'habitual' behaviour. Drug dependence is also defined by the 'occurrence of drugmotivated behaviour; therefore, the psychoactive chemical must be capable offunctioning as a reinforcer that can directly strengthen behaviour leading to furtherdrug ingestion'. 27 1.20 The Surgeon General's report found that, based on a number of studies of nicotine, 'the convergence of findings from several distinct approaches provides 22 Transcript of Evidence , p.711 (NSW Department of Health). 23 Transcript of Evidence , p.143 (National Heart Foundation). 24 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., pp.149, 215. 25 ibid., p.7. 26 Highly controlled drug use refers to drug-taking behaviour driven by strong urges. Experimental research and basic observations indicate that smoking is not a random or capricious behaviour thatsimply occurs at the will or pleasure of those who smoke. Rather, smoking is the result of behaviouraland pharmacologic factors that lead to highly controlled or compulsive use of cigarettes. The highlyconsistent patterns of cigarette smoking illustrate the controlled nature of the behaviour. For example,following initiation of smoking the individual gradually increases cigarette intake over time until he orshe achieves a level that remains stable during the smoker's lifetime. See ibid., p.149. 27 ibid., p.8.8compelling evidence that nicotine is a drug that can effectively control behaviour, including behaviour leading to its own ingestion (i.e. dependence or addiction)'.28 1.21 With regard to the addictive nature of nicotine, the Surgeon General's report stated that nicotine is psychoactive (mood altering) and can serve as a reinforcer tomotivate tobacco-seeking and tobacco-using behaviour. Tolerance develops toactions of nicotine, such that repeated use can be accompanied by increased intake.Nicotine also causes physical dependence characterised by a withdrawal syndromethat usually accompanies nicotine abstinence. 29 Nicotine acts on neurons in the brain's reward system to reinforce dependence. One study explained that 'drugs ofabuse such as nicotine, cocaine, and amphetamines target this system. Bybinding to nicotinic receptors, they commandeer neural pathways to prompt therelease of dopamine, a neurotransmitter implicated in reinforced behaviour'. 30 1.22 The controversy over the nature of 'addiction' as reflected in the contrasting views of the medical/scientific community on the one hand and the tobacco industryon the other, reflect to some extent differing interpretations of what constitutes'addiction'. For example, while the industry holds that intoxication is a core featureof addicting drugs, they tend to downplay the role of compulsion to use the substance(in this case, tobacco) - a role which is emphasised in the medical/scientificdefinition. In addition, while the industry characterises smoking as a 'habit' it hastended to ignore the fact that: The immediate satisfaction smokers report from smoking does largely depend on the sensory cues, the reason those cues are desirable isprobably because they have been reinforced or rewarded by nicotine'sactions in the brain. 31 1.23 Recent evidence also suggests that tobacco companies in the US and the UK recognised nicotine's addictiveness more than 30 years ago. A study of numerousdocuments obtained from several tobacco companies on their internal research intonicotine concluded that the companies 'recognised that nicotine is pharmacologicallyactive, that it is addictive, and that cigarettes are, in essence, nicotine deliverydevices'. 32 1.24 Evidence from the US also indicates that the industry is able to manipulate the level of nicotine to create and sustain smokers' addiction. Evidence suggests that thetobacco companies have achieved this through various means, such as adding 28 ibid., p.170. 29 ibid., p.215. See also A. Christen and J. Christen, 'Why is Cigarette Smoking so Addicting?', Health Values Chemical Engineering News , 28 November 1994, p.10. 31 ibid., p. 11. See also Submission No. 44, Appendix 6, pp.7-8 (Philip Morris). 32 J. Slade et al., 'Nicotine and Addiction: The Brown and Williamson Documents', Journal of the American Medical Association , Vol.27(3), July 19, 1995, p.225.9ammonia-based substances to cigarettes to enhance the delivery of nicotine, adding nicotine to 'low yield' cigarettes by the use of various technologies, and increasingthe nicotine content to filters, wrappers and other parts of the cigarette. 33 Conclusion 1.25 The Committee believes that, on the basis of the evidence received, nicotine is addictive. The Committee accepts the conclusions of the Surgeon General's report,discussed above, that found cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addictive andthat nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction. Passive smoking 1.26 While the adverse health effects of active smoking have been well documented over several decades, the health effects of passive smoking have only beensystematically investigated since the 1960s. 34 Inhalation of tobacco smoke other than by active smoking is referred to as passive or involuntary smoking; the smoke fromthis source is also called environmental tobacco smoke (ETS). There are two sources of such smoke sidestream smoke passing directly into the air from the burning tobacco and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Sidestream smoke is the predominantcomponent of environmental tobacco smoke. The concentration of chemicals insidestream smoke differs significantly from that of mainstream smoke - for example,it has much higher concentrations of ammonia, benzene, carbon monoxide, nicotineand various highly carcinogenic chemicals. 35 1.27 Evidence to the Committee suggested that there are serious health effects associated with passive smoking. ACOSH cited several studies that showed a linkbetween passive smoking and respiratory diseases especially in infants and children. 36 The Thoracic Society stated that passive smoke exposure is associated with anincreased frequency of asthmatic attacks in children and adults, an increased rate ofrespiratory infections in children and adults, an increased risk of lung cancer in adultsand possible increased risk of death from coronary heart disease in adults. 37 1.28 Several major studies have also documented the adverse health effects of passive smoking. In Australia, a National Health and Medical Research Council(NHMRC) review of the effects of passive smoking on health concluded that passivesmoking had various adverse effects upon child health, adult respiratory health and 33 D. Kessler, 'Statement on Nicotine-Containing Cigarettes', Tobacco Control , Vol. 3, 1994, pp.150-153; See also Wall Street Journal , 19 October 1995. 34 Transcript of Evidence , p.338 (ACOSH). 35 A. McMichael, 'Passive Smoking: A Review of Research and Public Health Policy', Cancer Forum, Vol.7, July 1987, Society of Australia).10the risks of cancer and cardiovascular disease. The report concluded that there is mounting epidemiological evidence that passive smoking increases the risk of lungcancer, whereas the epidemiological evidence of an increased risk of cancers at sitesother than the lung is less strong. In the light of this assessment, the NHMRCrecommended that procedures, regulations or laws should be introduced to restrict orprohibit smoking within the workplace. 38 1.29 In the United States, a report of the US Surgeon General into the health consequences of involuntary smoking concluded that passive smoking is a cause oflung cancer in non-smokers, although the association of passive smoking withcancers other than lung cancers and with cardiovascular disease was not clearlyestablished. The report also found that the children of parents who smoked comparedwith the children of non-smoking parents had an increased frequency of respiratoryinfections, increased respiratory symptoms and slightly smaller rates of increase inlung function as the lung matures. 39 1.30 A more recent study by the US Environmental Protection Agency found that, in children, exposure to passive smoking is causally associated with an increased riskof lower respiratory tract infections such as bronchitis and pneumonia and withadditional episodes and increased severity of asthma. The report classifiedenvironmental tobacco smoke (ETS) as a Group A (known human) carcinogen. Thisclassification is reserved for those compounds which have been shown to causecancer in humans. 40 A recent United States study has shown that exposure to ETS during adult life increases the risk of lung cancer of non-smokers. Another studyfound that married female non-smokers have a 30 per cent greater risk of developinglung cancer than married women whose husbands do not smoke. The study alsofound that the increased risk for women of developing lung cancer who were exposedto ETS during adult life in the household was 24 per cent, in the workplace (39 percent) and in social settings (50 per cent). 41 1.31 Evidence suggests that tobacco companies in the United States and the United Kingdom had known since the mid 1970s of the health effects of passive smoking.Documents obtained through the US Congress indicate that the Brown andWilliamson Tobacco Corporation (B&W) and its parent company BAT Industries(formerly British American Tobacco Company) had conducted internal research onETS, some of which has supported the conclusion that ETS is harmful to health. The 38 NHMRC, Report of the Working Party on the Effects of Passive Smoking , AGPS, Canberra, 1986. 39 US Surgeon General, The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking , US Department of Health and Human Services, Rockville, MD, 1986. 40 US Environmental Protection Agency, Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking , Washington, DC, EPA, 1992. 41 E. Fontham et al., 'Environmental Tobacco Smoke and Lung Cancer in Nonsmoking Women', Journal of the American Medical Association , Vol.271, No.22, 8 June 1994, p.1752. The study surveyed over 600 women in five cities across the US. The increased risk associated with social settings may reflect alarger number of smokers and smoke exposures in these settings.11reports from BAT's annual research conferences show that BAT had found toxic substances in sidestream smoke. In addition, the reports indicate that sidestreamsmoke had been found biologically active, and therefore potentially carcinogenic, inBAT's laboratory tests. 42 1.32 Other research has questioned the association between exposure to ETS and a range of health effects. A recent study commissioned by the Tobacco Institute ofAustralia concluded that the data did not support a causal relationship betweenexposure to ETS and lung cancer or heart disease in adults. In relation to the healtheffects on children, the study concluded that while exposure to ETS is associated withan increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections in infants, there is a weakassociation between exposure to ETS in infancy and the subsequent likelihood ofdeveloping asthma. The study also argued that exposure to ETS was associated withonly a small increase in risk for upper respiratory tract infection in children. 43 1.33 A representative of the AMA, commenting on the study, noted that the publication of the study had not 'changed our attitude' as to the serious health effectsof passive smoking. The representative added 'It looks a bit more at the acute effectsof passive smoking rather than long term effects. It is another contribution to ourunderstanding of environmental tobacco smoke, but we still feel the majority ofopinion is that it is not something that is healthy'. 44 Conclusion 1.34 The Committee believes that, on the basis of the majority of available studies on passive smoking and health, passive smoking causes a number of adverse healtheffects for non-smokers, especially in the areas of child health, adult respiratoryhealth and lung cancer. Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS: 1. That smoking not be permitted in enclosed places, including office, factory, shop or other work sites, shopping centres, restaurants, theatres, hotels andsporting venues. 2. That in respect of offices, shops, restaurants etc., outdoor or separately ventilated indoor spaces be made available for smokers, but that staff not becompelled to work in, or service, these areas. 42 D.

Lee et al., Health Aspects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke , November 1994, pp.viii-xi. 44 Transcript of Evidence , p.393 (AMA).12Listing of nicotine patches on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme 1.35 The Committee received some evidence that nicotine transdermal patches (nicotine patches) should be listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS).45 Nicotine patches are a recent pharmaceutical development to assist smokers to quitsmoking through nicotine replacement therapy. An adhesive patch is applied to theskin which releases a controlled delivery of nicotine into the bloodstream. Thepatches were approved for use as an aid to smoking cessation in Australia in 1993and are available on prescription. 46 1.36 The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) in 1994 recommended that nicotine patches be listed under the PBS.47 The Commonwealth Government, however, rejected the PBAC recommended listing on the PBS inOctober 1994 on the grounds that nicotine-patch therapy should be provided as partof a structured smoking-cessation program (which it considers is a State governmentresponsibility); and the cost of the measure (the annual cost to the PBS was estimatedto be $100 million). 48 1.37 A number of studies have found that nicotine patches are an effective aid in smoking cessation, especially for motivated, nicotine-dependent smokers.49 Research suggests that nicotine patches are most successful in cases where the smoker uses15 cigarettes or more a day, has tried to quit smoking before, is prepared to quit againand where the motivation to quit is strong. 50 1.38 Research studies that have assessed the success of nicotine patches in smoking cessation have found that the success rates vary, although most report someimprovement in cessation rates especially in the short to medium term. One studyfound that rates of successful cessation at the end of nicotine patch treatment variedwidely, from a high of 77 per cent at six weeks after cessation, to a low of 18 per centat three weeks. 51 Another study assessed the effectiveness of 12-week treatment with a 24 hour nicotine patch treatment in helping heavy smokers to quit smoking;cessation was confirmed in 19 per cent of users. 52 ACOSH, citing several research 45 Submission No. 18, p.1 (Marion Merrell Dow Australia Pty Ltd); Submission No. 12, p.1 (Dr C. Mendelsohn). 46 ACOSH, Sheet: Nicotine Patches , 1993, p.1. 47 The PBAC recommendation was for the provision of a four-week supply of nicotine patches.48 Submission No.18, Appendix 2 (Marion Merrell Dow).49 M.

As noted previously,the Commonwealth Government has estimated the annual cost of providing nicotinepatches via the PBS at $100 million. Marion Merrell Dow has, however, estimatedthat the cost to the PBS would be $21.7 million annually. 54 Another submission also suggested that the Commonwealth's cost estimate may have been overstated, due toan overestimate in the predicted demand for nicotine patches should they be listed onthe PBS. 55 1.40 Evidence suggests that nicotine patch therapy may be more cost-effective than many other widely accepted medical practices, eg. treatment for hypertension orscreening for cervical cancer. One submission noted that the expenditure associatedwith extending the life of one woman by one year through cervical cancer screeningcould extend the lives of nine women, each by one year, if applied to nicotine patchtherapy. 56 1.41 Proponents of the listing of nicotine patches argued that making nicotine patches available via the PBS would address equity and access concerns. Severalsubmissions argued that many smokers, especially pensioners and people from lowsocio-economic groups, are dissuaded from using nicotine patches because of theircost. 57 One submission from a doctor noted that 'although patches cost about the same as the average day's cigarettes, many financially disadvantaged smokers such aspensioners report that they are unable to afford to outlay the cost of a week's patchesat a time (the minimum supply). These smokers buy their cigarettes on a dailybasis'. 58 Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 53 ACOSH, Fact Sheet: Nicotine Patches , 1993, p.1. 54 This costing is based on an estimate of 300 000 patients using nicotine patches a nnually at a price of $72.25 for a 28 day supply of patches.

The costs of tobacco-related illness 1.42 A number of studies have attempted to quantify the costs and/or benefits of smoking in Australia. The Collins and Lapsley studies and the AIHW study referredto below assess the economic costs generated by tobacco use in Australia while theACIL study looks at both the economic 'costs' and 'benefits' to the Australiancommunity.15Table 3 Economic costs of tobacco use, 1988 Tangible costs $m Production loss morbiditymortality186.5 1095.4 Total production campaigns and research snaWelfare snaTotal tangible costs 813.2 Intangible costs $m Mortality Consumption of deceased 2800.5Value of loss of life to deceased 3227.8Suffering of others snq Morbidity Pain and suffering - of sick- of road accident victims Suffering of otherssnq - snq Total intangible costs 6028.3 TOTAL (tangible and intangible costs) 6841.5 sna indicates significant but not available snq indicates significant but not quantifiable- indicates zero or not significant Source: D. Collins and H. Lapsley , Estimating the Economic Costs of Drug Abuse in Australia , AGPS, Canberra, 1991, pp.89-90.16The Collins and Lapsley studies 1.43 In a study commissioned by the then Commonwealth Department of Community Services and Health, Collins and Lapsley provided an estimate of the netcost of tobacco abuse in 1988. The study estimated that the cost associated withtobacco use was $6.84 billion in 1988. 59 This costing comprised tangible costs of $813.2 million, and intangible costs of $6028.5 million. The results are presented inTable 3. 1.44 Tangible costs included in the study, which are defined as costs whose reduction will yield resources which become available to the community forconsumption or investment purposes, include costs associated with production lossesand health care costs (which include medical, hospital and nursing home costs).Intangible costs are costs such as pain and suffering, which, while real, do notrepresent a call on the productive resources of the community. As Table 3 shows, thestudy did not provide estimates for intangible costs associated with pain andsuffering. The report noted that while these costs are not easily quantifiable, theyrepresent significant costs. The authors emphasised that these estimates are likely tounderestimate the actual costs of tobacco abuse in Australia. 1.45 In a revised study, Collins and Lapsley estimated that the costs of tobacco use in 1992 were $9.2 billion. 60 Unlike the 1988 estimates, the revised figures include cost estimates for passive smoking (totalling $846 million).61 The total revised costing, based on 1992 mortality and morbidity figures, comprised $692 million oftangible costs, including those associated with loss of workforce productivity, healthcare costs and resources used in addictive tobacco consumption; and $8.552 billion ofintangible costs, including mortality (value of loss of life to the deceased,consumption foregone by deceased, suffering imposed on rest of community) andmorbidity (pain and suffering of the sick, and suffering imposed on the rest of thecommunity). 62 1.46 The authors note that the figures in the revised study are not directly comparable to their earlier study due to 'developments in methodology and anextension in coverage', including the costs of passive smoking (some 10 per cent ofthe total costs). 63 The authors state that the cost estimates in the current study are 59 D. Collins and H. Lapsley, Estimating the Economic Costs of Drug Abuse in Australia , AGPS, Canberra, 1991, pp.79-90. 60 D. Collins and H. Lapsley, The Economic Costs Generated by Tobacco Use in Australia , February 1994, p.16. 61 Passive smoking costs were estimated by using 1990 US estimates of passive smoking deaths as a proportion of deaths attributable to direct smoking and applying this proportion to Australian estimatesof direct smoking deaths. See ibid., pp.4, 17. 62 Submission No.27, section 5.1 (DHS&H).63 Collins and Lapsley (1994), op. cit., p.14.17likely to be an underestimate of the overall cost of tobacco-related illness in Australia. AIHW study 1.47 A joint project undertaken by the AIHW and the National Centre for Health Program Evaluation has also estimated the costs of tobacco related illness inAustralia. 64 As shown in Table 4, the study estimated that in 1989-90 the cost of tobacco related disease was $1 399 million. 1.48 This figure comprised $594 million in direct costs and $805 million in indirect costs. Direct costs comprised health care costs, including the costs of hospital(inpatient costs only), medical, pharmaceutical, nursing home and allied professionalcare. Indirect costs included foregone earings due to premature deaths and the costsof lost productivity due to ill health. 1.49 In terms of specific diseases, the major contributors to the total cost of tobacco-related disease in 1989-90 were coronary heart disease ($473 million), ($235 million), chronic bronchitis ($179 million), peripheral vascular disease($96 million) and stroke ($80 million). These five diseases together accounted for76 per cent of the total cost of tobacco related disease in 1989-90. 1.50 The study noted that the cost estimates should be treated as conservative, preliminary estimates only and differ from the cost estimates of other researchers,such as Collins and Lapsley, due to methodological differences. 65 64 Submission No.71, pp.22-24 (AIHW). 65 For a discussion of the methodology used in the study see ibid., pp.53-56.18Table 4 Costs of major tobacco related diseases by sector of expenditure, Australia, 1989-90 Health care costs Indirect costs Total costs Disease $ million % of total $ million % of total $ mil lion % of total Lung cancer 51 8.6 184 22.9 235 16.8 All tobacco related cancer 96 16.2 278 34.5 374 26.7 Coronary heart disease 118 19.9 355 44.1 473 33.8 Stroke 43 7.2 37 4.6 80 5.7Peripheral vascular disease 73 12.3 23 2.9 96 6.9 All tobacco related cardiovascular disease 298 50.2 441 54.8 739 52.8 Chronic bronchitis 123 20.7 56 7.0 179 12.8 Peptic ulcer 41 6.9 10 1. 2 51 3.6 All other tobacco related disease 36 6.0 20 2.5 56 4.0 All tobacco related disease 594 100.0 805 100.0 p.23 (AIHW). ACIL study 1.51 In a major study commissioned by the Tobacco Institute of Australia, ACIL Economics and Policy Pty Ltd sought to assess 'the costs and benefits to Australiansand Australia from smoking'. 66 This study differs from those studies referred to in the previous section in that it attempts to quantify both the economic 'costs' and'benefits' from tobacco use. 1.52 The study estimated that smoking, and associated activities which supply tobacco products to smokers, provided net benefits to Australia of $12.5 billion in1992-93. Of this amount, $9.1 billion accrued to smokers in the form of 'consumersurplus', and $3.4 billion constituted the tobacco industry's to Gross Domestic Product. 1.53 'Consumer surplus' is an economic concept that recognises that people are generally willing to pay more for a product than they actually have to pay. It is a wayof measuring the utility or value that consumers expect to derive from a product or 66 ACIL Economics and Policy Pty Ltd, Smoking: Costs and Benefits for Australia , ACIL, 1994, p.vii.19service.67 In the ACIL study, consumer surplus is defined as the net benefits from smoking, that is, the total amount smokers are willing to pay for smoking less thecosts to them of the activity. 68 One study has noted that 'we know that individuals voluntarily buy tobacco products, which implies that they gain or benefit in exchangefor their money. The extra gain that smokers obtain from their purchases is calledconsumers surplus by economists. This is the amount which consumers gain fromtheir purchases beyond what they actually pay'. 69 In the ACIL study, the calculation of the consumer surplus is based on the demand elasticity of tobacco products (whichis calculated at -0.47), the quantity of cigarettes consumed and the purchase price ofcigarettes. 70 1.54 The 'net economic benefits', identified in the ACIL study, combine the benefits to smokers of smoking, added to the incomes and taxes generated (or valueadded) by the tobacco industry, based on the prices which smokers and the industryface in the market place. The results of the study are summarised in Table 5. 1.55 As noted in the table, the study uses two categories of costs which are characterised as the private costs the retail price of cigarettes ($5.4 billion) and health-related and other private costs ($3.2 billion). The retail price of cigarettesrefers to the purchase price of tobacco (as measured by retail sales), including taxes.Health costs in the study are based on Collins and Lapsley's estimates, adjusteddownwards by 50 per cent and indexed to 1992-93 prices. 71 'Benefits' in the study are measured in relation to the 'consumer surplus' this concept is a measure of the net benefits to smokers gained from smoking.72 The study estimates the net benefits to be $9.1 billion. This figure is obtained by subtracting the total benefits($17.7 billion) from the costs of smoking ($8.6 billion). The GDP figure of$3.4 billion was derived using conventional GDP accounting terms, based on thevalue added by the tobacco industry, including tobacco product taxes. 73 67 Consumer surplus has been defined by the Department of Finance as 'a measure of the benefit to a consumer, net of the sacrifice he or she has to make, from being able to buy a good at a particular price;the difference between the amount a consumer is prepared to pay for a good (rather than go without it)and the amount actually paid'.

Costings Issues 1.56 The studies referred to above provide contrasting views as to the economic and social impact of smoking in the Australian community. Some of the issues raisedin these studies are discussed below. Private versus social costs 1.57 The studies differ in their categorisation of private and social costs. Collins and Lapsley include as social costs all costs which are privately borne by smokersthemselves. These include such items as the resources used in producing tobaccoproducts (which is reflected in the price of cigarettes paid by smokers), loss ofproduction and income to smokers, and the value of life foregone by smokers whocontract smoking-related disease. In the ACIL report these costs are treated as privatecosts, rather than social costs. Private costs are costs that are knowingly and freelyborne by the consumer. 1.58 Determination of whether costs privately borne by smokers should be classified as private costs or social costs is considered to depend on the extent to21which they are borne intentionally.74 This in turn depends on the extent to which smokers are aware of the health risks of smoking, whether they are addicted or not,and, if they are, whether they can be said to be rationally addicted. To the extent thatsmokers are aware, non-addicted and/or rationally addicted, these costs areconsidered by some as private costs. However, to the extent that smokers are notaware or are irrationally addicted, at least some proportion of these costs will besocial costs. 1.59 The Committee received conflicting evidence as to whether the costs borne by smokers should be considered as private or social costs. A representative of ACILargued that such costs should be considered as private costs as they fulfilled thecriteria listed above. 75 In its report, ACIL argues that smokers are well aware of, and fully informed about, the effects of smoking. The report points to the substantialresources spent informing smokers and the public generally of the effects of smoking,and market research polls of Australian consumers that show a high level ofawareness across the community of smoking related health risks. 76 On the question of addiction, the representative of ACIL noted that, based on observations of people'ssmoking behaviour over time, 'what you observe, is that people are giving up smoking regularly ...There are now more former smokers than there are present smokers. So that says to me that it is not a matter of total addiction, in the sense ofcomplete inability to give up'. 77 1.60 An alternative view on these issues was offered by Professor Collins who raised doubts concerning the extent to which smokers are really aware of the effectsof smoking. 78 He also questioned whether smokers make rational decisions in deciding to become smokers. He noted that 'there is a great deal of evidence tosuggest that almost all smokers start when they are in their very early teens. Youreally have to ask whether they are capable of looking at the appropriate evidence andevaluating it at that stage. A lot of the evidence is epidemiological evidence which iscomplex and actually quite inaccessible'. 79 In relation to the question of addiction, Professor Collins argued that about 90 per cent of tobacco consumption 'is ataddictive levels. In other words, it is by addicts'. 80 74 Industry Commission, The Tobacco Growing and Manufacturing Industries , AGPS, Canberra, 1994, pp.226-27. 75 Transcript of Evidence , pp.446-48 (ACIL). 76 ACIL report, op. cit., pp.13-14. 77 Transcript of Evidence , p.447 (ACIL). 78 See also the discussion of the issue of addiction (paragraphs 1.14 -1.25).79 Transcript of Evidence , p.767 (Professor D. Collins). 80 ibid. See also Collins and Lapsley (1994), op. cit., p.7. This estimate was based on the view that consumption of more than 10 cigarettes per day is addictive, based on medical evidence provided toCollins & Lapsley that the addictive threshold for tobacco consumption is likely to be 5-7 cigarettes perday. For a further discussion of the issue of addiction see paragraphs 1.14-1.25.22Treatment of benefits from smoking 1.61 The studies differ in the treatment they accord to the supposed 'benefits' derived from smoking. The ACIL report argues that the Collins and Lapsley study isflawed in that it ignores entirely the 'benefits' that are derived from smoking. TheACIL study, by contrast, calculates substantial net benefits to smokers, based onsmokers' willingness to pay for tobacco products. 81 As noted above, it was estimated that some $9.1 billion accrued to smokers in the form of consumer surplus. In Collinsand Lapsley's initial study the authors viewed all smoking as drug abuse andconsequently assumed that there are no benefits to be derived from this activity. Intheir more recent study, however, Collins and Lapsley do allow for some level ofnon-addictive or dependent consumption. Professor Collins noted that 'we do notassume that all smoking yields no benefits. In practice, in our view, a very smallproportion of smokers are likely to be both rational and fully informed, and our guessis in the order of 10 per cent [of smokers]'. 82 1.62 The argument that Collins and Lapsley do not take sufficient account of the benefits of smoking to the economy has been acknowledged in some evidence to theCommittee. One submission noted that the benefits to the economy from the tobaccogrowing and tobacco manufacturing industries as well as taxation receipts mightreasonably be offset against the costs of smoking. 83 1.63 A study has also argued that ACIL's estimate of the net economic benefits to the community have been overstated. This study calculates that the net economicbenefits of smoking as $7.7 billion (this compares with ACIL's estimate of$12.5 billion in 1992-93). 84 A comparison of the two estimates is set out in Table 6. 81 See also paragraphs 1.51-1.55. 82 Transcript of Evidence , pp.767-78 (Professor D.

Parish, Comments on ACIL 'Smoking: Costs and Benefits for Australia' , March 1994, in Submission No. 65, Appendix 1 (ACIL). 1.64 The calculation by ACIL of a perceived 'consumer surplus' of some $9.1 billion has been the subject of some debate. A study by Professor Parish arguedthat ACIL overestimates the value of the consumer surplus. While, as notedpreviously, ACIL estimated this item at $9.1 billion, the Parish study argued that themore appropriate figure should be $5.7 billion, some 40 per cent less than ACIL'sestimate. 85 Professor Parish noted, however, that 'a rather lower, but not implausible assumption regarding the elasticity of demand would yield an estimate of consumers'surplus similar to ACIL's result'. He also noted that 'any estimate of consumers'surplus is highly conjectural'. 86 1.65 ACIL, in a submission to the Committee, acknowledged that Professor Parish had drawn attention to 'an analytical error in the equivalence we had assumed for theprice elasticity of demand for cigarettes and the price elasticity of demand forsmoking'. 87 ACIL noted: Thus while correcting for the Parish comment would reduce the consumer surplus estimate, ACIL had already erred on the side of 85 The study noted that, 'ACIL apply the elasticity estimate of -0.47 to the \"price\" of 0.26 per stick, and assuming a linear demand curve, calculate its intersection with the vertical axis is at a price of $0.82,and that the aggregate consumers' surplus is $9 133 million. The correct procedure is to apply theelasticity estimate to the average retail price of 0.165 per stick: the intersection now occurs at a price of$0.516, and the consumers' surplus turns out to be $5 721.3 million, 40 per cent less than ACIL'sestimate'. See Parish, op. cit., p.5. 86 ibid., pp.1, 6. 87 Submission No. 65, p.4 (ACIL).24caution when assuming a price elasticity estimate. A slightly less conservative, but still plausible elasticity estimate would result in aconsumer surplus analogous to that in the ACIL report. ACIL thereforecontinues to adhere to that figure [of $9.1 billion]. 88 1.66 The Industry Commission report raised some concerns with regard to ACIL's estimate of the consumer surplus. The report noted: To put ACIL's original $9.1 billion estimate of consumer surplus into perspective, the Commission notes that total private final consumption expenditure on food for 1992-93 was $36.6 billion and since less than one-quarter of the population are smokers, it implies that smokers werewilling to pay an additional amount (over and above the $5.4 billionspent on cigarettes and tobacco in that year) equivalent to their totalexpenditure on food in order to maintain the same level of cigaretteconsumption. Despite ACIL's downward revision of the estimate ofconsumer surplus, [from $9.1 billion to $5.7 billion] the Commission isinclined to question the validity of equating willingness to pay with anet benefit to consumers of tobacco products. Since each consumer hasa finite budget, the ability to pay would require a reduction inconsumption of other goods and a corresponding reduction in whateverbenefit currently accrues from the consumption of those other goods. 89 1.67 It must be noted that ACIL itself does not seek to draw any policy conclusions from the question of the size of the consumer surplus as an ACIL representative said to the Committee: The ACIL report was careful to explain that the consumer surplus estimates had no implications for policy that is, there are no actions governments should take based on a knowledge of consumer surplus. The only purpose in undertaking the estimate was because it wasignored by C&L. 90 Methodological differences 1.68 The studies also make different methodological assumptions which in turn lead to quite different cost estimates. For example, ACIL argues that by employingdifferent assumptions regarding aetiological (or cause of death) data the Collins andLapsley study would have produced lower estimates of the costs attributed tosmoking. ACIL argues that the aetiological fractions used by Collins and Lapsley 88 ibid. 89 Lower socio-economic groups, in particular, may have to reduce their consumption of other goods to pay for the purchase of cigarettes. See Industry Commission, op. cit., p.226. See also Chapter 4. 90 Submission No.65, p.3 (ACIL).25substantially overestimate the mortality effects that can be attributed to smoking.91 However, ACIL states that 'it is impossible to determine the extent of the overstatement by C&L of premature deaths due to tobacco'.92 Collins and Lapsley also recognise, however, that caution is needed in interpreting causes of death data,noting in particular the absence of causes of death data for passive smoking and forthe abuse of licit drugs. 93 1.69 The treatment of health costs in the respective studies has also been the subject of debate. As noted above, Collins and Lapsley estimated the health costs of tobacco-related illness at $609.6 million in their original study. ACIL provides an estimate of$384 million for such costs, using Collins and Lapsley's figures, but reducing theestimate by 50 per cent to take account of the alleged over-estimation of such costsby Collins and Lapsley. One study has suggested, however, that ACILunderestimated the health costs in their study and suggested that a more accuratefigure would be about $500 million. 94 This estimate is closer to Collins and Lapsley's original figure, which approximates an estimate of the health costs estimated in theAIHW study (totalling $594 million in 1989-90). 95 Conclusions 1.70 Any attempt to estimate the economic costs and/or benefits of smoking will necessarily involve debate over a range of complex methodological and conceptualissues. An appropriate methodology for measuring 'costs' and/or 'benefits' in thisarea is unlikely to be easily arrived at, if at all. The various studies reviewed by theCommittee approach the problem of measuring the costs and benefits of tobacco usefrom different perspectives. The Collins and Lapsley studies treat the costs oftobacco-related illness as social costs, while the ACIL study views the costs asprivate, rather than social costs. 96 Given these fundamental differences in approach it is not surprising that the studies come to different conclusions regarding theeconomic impact of tobacco use in Australia. 1.71 The Committee recognises that the ACIL study, in offering an analysis of both the 'costs' and 'benefits' of smoking, makes a contribution to debate in this area. The 91 ACIL argues that there are two methodological criticisms that can be levelled at Collins and Lapsley's use of aetiological fractions -the use of fractions for more than one risk factor, for example, tobacco andalcohol, will result in some of the assessed deaths being counted for both risk factors (double counting);and some confusion between association and causation-causation being concluded as the reason fordeath, in some instances, when association was as far as could reasonably be claimed. See ACIL report, op. cit., p.19. 92 ibid., pp.16-19. 93 Collins and Lapsley (1991), op. cit., p.63. 94 The figure of $500 million includes an estimate of payments by private health funds. ACIL's original estimate included only publicly provided health care. See Parish, op. cit., p.8. 95 Submission No.71, p.23 (AIHW).96 See also paragraph 1.59.26Committee, however, believes that the calculation of the 'consumer surplus' may be open to question. Cost-recovery mechanisms 1.72 Evidence to the Committee suggested several ways in which the costs of tobacco-related illness could be recouped. At present the direct costs of tobacco usein Australia are borne by the contributions of taxpayers to the costs of medical carefor smokers and those affected by passive smoking; private individuals, families andfriends; the voluntary contributions of individuals and organisations to non-government organisations who conduct smoking prevention/cessation and educationprograms; and the allocation of a proportion of taxes collected by State and TerritoryGovernments to health promotion bodies. 97 1.73 In theory, government could attempt to recoup the cost of tobacco-related illness by charging individuals for treatment of tobacco-related illness. However, asDHS&H has noted the possibility of direct cost recovery by, for example, smokerssubsidising their own tobacco related medical costs, is precluded under the currentAustralian health care system which provides access to services on a non-discriminatory basis unrelated to cause of illness. This policy reflects the communityattitude that particular groups, such as smokers, should not be singled out or excludedfrom access to health care services that are universally available. 98 1.74 Some evidence to the inquiry suggested that tobacco companies should make a direct contribution to the health and other costs imposed on the community by theuse of their products. The Thoracic Society of Australia proposed that a Smokers'Compensation Trust be established to provide financial assistance to families wherethe smoker suffers death or permanent disability as a result of smoking. The tobaccocompanies would contribute to the fund according to their profits or turnover oftobacco products. The trust would distribute funds to smokers and their familiesaccording to lost earnings and damages upon death in a similar manner to workers'compensation payments. 1.75 A representative of the Thoracic Society explained the rationale for establishing the trust in the following terms: At the moment, the cost for invalid pensions and widows' pensions and things like that is met by the government if people become disabledfrom smoking...the government should not bear that cost alone as itdoes at present. The workers' compensation process works in the same way the industry contributes to funds from which disabled workers and their families are paid. We feel that we should recognise the 97 Transcript of Evidence , p.336 (ACOSH). 98 Submission No.27, section 5.10 (DHS&H).27tobacco industry's contribution to these deaths and disabilities, and that the industry should contribute, in a financial way, to compensation.99 1.76 The tobacco industry, by contrast, argues that the industry more than 'pays its way' through the high level of taxation on tobacco products, which counterbalancesthe health care costs imposed by smokers on the community. ACIL argues that therewas a net contribution by smokers of $2.2 billion to consolidated revenue in 1992-93.This figure is derived from taxation receipts levied on tobacco products($2493 million), plus tariffs on tobacco products ($125 million), minus health carecosts ($384 million). 100 1.77 Another avenue for recovering costs from the tobacco industry canvassed during the inquiry would be to institute litigation proceedings against tobaccocompanies. Several groups, including ACOSH and ASH Australia, proposed that theFederal Government launch civil legal proceedings against the tobacco companies torecoup the costs associated with the treatment of illnesses and diseases related totobacco use. 101 ASH Australia argued that the proceeds of such an action would enable, among other things, a fund to be established to provide smoking cessationcourses and counselling for smokers. 102 1.78 The Committee understands that a coalition of anti-smoking groups in Australia proposes to introduce a class action against the industry over evidence thatUnited States tobacco companies concealed research for more than 30 years thatshowed tobacco was harmful and addictive. The AMA has also proposed that theCommonwealth Government fund a class action in the Federal Court on behalf ofsmokers. ASH Australia has recently set up a registry of smokers willing to join aclass action. 103 1.79 Litigation against tobacco companies has been more a feature in the United States than in Australia. In 1994 the State of Mississippi became the first US state tofile suit against the tobacco industry to seek reimbursement for the costs of treatingsmoking-related illness incurred by Medicaid and other public health-care programsin the State. 104 The states of Minnesota, West Virginia and Florida have also filed similar suits. It has been reported that several other states may also seek similar 99 Transcript of Evidence , p.366 (Professor A. W. Musk). 100 ACIL report, op. cit., pp.32-33. 101 Submission No.29, p. 16 (ACOSH); Transcript of Evidence , p.655 (ASH Australia). 102 ASH Australia, Press Release , 30 August 1995, p.1. 103 The Age , 24 July, 1995; letter from ASH Australia to the Committee, 11 October 1995. 104 Medicaid is a jointly funded program between the US Federal and State governments to assist States in the provision of medical and health-related services to eligible needy persons. Within broad nationalguidelines which the Federal government establishes, the States lay down their own eligibility standards;and determine the type, amount and scope of services. The program thus varies considerably from Stateto State.28compensation from tobacco companies.105 Numerous lawsuits by individuals have also been instituted against tobacco companies in the United States. In February 1995a ruling in the US District Court permitted a New Orleans lawsuit filed against UStobacco companies to go forward as a class action. This suit is now the largest classaction lawsuit in United States history. 106 1.80 The Committee received evidence that there may be difficulties in launching litigation proceedings in the Australian context. For example, in regard to theprovision of legal aid in Australia in preparing test case compensation claims, arepresentative of a tobacco company noted that in Australia, unlike the United States,costs follow the event: It means that, if any of those claimants are unsuccessful, the government stands to lose an awful lot of money ...in America, costs do not follow the event, there are contingency fees. There has never in thehistory of the industry been a successful claim asserted by any plaintiffto recover damages. I believe that will remain the case. I believe thatwill be the case in Australia; I believe that will be the case in England. Ido not believe that it is appropriate for the government to supportclaimants who, under like circumstances, have been demonstrated to bewholly unsuccessful claimants in other jurisdictions. 107 1.81 Another means of recouping the cost of tobacco-related illness in the Australian context would be to increase Commonwealth excise duties andState/Territory business franchise fees on tobacco products. One submission notedthat a large increase in this form of taxation would have a significant impact on thedemand for tobacco products. Research shows that staged and widely publicisedincreases in the real price of tobacco products does have an impact on the demand forcigarettes, particularly among adolescents and potential smokers. Directly targetingthe revenue earned from the excise and other taxes would significantly reduce thecost to society of tobacco abuse; and such an initiative would clearly signal theGovernment's further commitment to reducing consumption. 108 As noted in Chapter 3, the Committee believes that there should be regular, real increases intobacco taxes levied at the Commonwealth and State/Territory levels and that part ofthe revenue from these taxes should be directed to tobacco control and healthpromotion activities. 109 105 Victorian Smoking and Health Program, Status Report: What's Happening in the Legislative and Litigation Spheres of Tobacco Control in the USA , 9 May 1995, pp.22 ,25. 106 ibid., p.25. 107 Transcript of Evidence , pp.492-93 (Philip Morris). 108 Submission No.27, section 5.11 (DHS&H).109 See paragraphs 3.87-3.101.29CHAPTER 2 GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INDUSTRY 2.1 The tobacco industry in Australia is subject to a number of regulatory controls. These regulations are designed primarily to reduce the consumption of tobaccoproducts. This chapter discusses the current regulations which restrict the promotionof tobacco products by way of advertising and promotion, the conditions under whichthe products are consumed, and taxation arrangements. The chapter also identifiesareas where the current regulatory activity of government could be improved orexpanded to reduce or modify the consumption of tobacco products for healthreasons. Regulation of tobacco advertising and promotion 2.2 Tobacco advertising has been progressively restricted in Australia since the 1970s. Direct cigarette advertising has been banned on radio and television inAustralia since 1976. In 1988, the ban was extended to include all tobacco products.The legislation, however, was framed to allow 'accidental or incidental' advertising.Cinema and billboard advertising remained the responsibility of the States andTerritories. 1 2.3 In 1989 the Commonwealth introduced the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act 1989 . The Act banned tobacco advertising in all newspapers and magazines from December 1990. Exemptions were allowed fornewspapers and journals published overseas and 'not principally intended' fordistribution in Australia. 2.4 Prior to the commencement of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 the status of tobacco advertising in Australia was as follows: direct advertising in the print and broadcast media was prohibited by the Commonwealth by virtue of the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition ) Act 1989 and the Broadcasting Act 1942 (as amended); other forms of advertising (billboards, cinemas, leaflets etc) were prohibited in Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the ACTunder specific State/Territory legislation; and other States/Territories (Queensland, New South Wales, Tasmania and the Northern Territory) continued to rely on voluntary agreements 1 Submission No.27, section 4.14 (DHS&H).30regulating the content and placement of advertisements with the objective of protecting children.2 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 2.5 In 1992 the Commonwealth introduced the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 which introduced further restrictions on all forms of tobacco advertising, including broadcasting and the print media effective from 1 July 1993.3 The objective of the legislation was to provide a national standard with respect to tobaccoadvertising prohibition, resulting from the differences in State and Territorylegislation and the lack of comprehensive legislation in some States and Territorieson certain forms of advertising restrictions. 4 2.6 The extent of the prohibitions in the Act on the broadcast and publication of tobacco advertisements is extensive, covering almost any conduct which promotestobacco products. As noted above, the Act prohibited the broadcast or publication oftobacco advertisements, after 1 July 1993. The effect of the legislation is to prohibitprint media advertising; advertisements in films, videos, television or radio;advertising on tickets, handbills and other documents; the sale or supply of any itemcontaining a tobacco advertisement; and outdoor advertising on billboards or publictransport. 5 2.7 'Tobacco advertisement' is defined very broadly in the Act, and includes any visual or audible message that publicises or promotes smoking, tobacco products,trademarks, designs or manufacturers' names, or any other words closely associatedwith tobacco products, whether or not such words are also closely associated withother kinds of products. 6 'Tobacco product' is also defined widely to include not only tobacco and products containing tobacco, but also cigarette paper, cigarette rollersand pipes. 7 2.8 There are a number of exemptions and defences in the Act. Tobacco advertising is exempted from the prohibition where: it is an accidental or incidental broadcast or publication of tobacco advertisements where the person or body broadcasting does not receive 2 ibid., section 4.16. Legislation was subsequently enacted in New South Wales in 1991. 3 This Act repealed the Smoking and Tobacco Products Advertisements (Prohibition) Act 1989. 4 Submission No.27, sections 4.14-4.19 (DHS&H). 5 Submission No. 45, p.11 ( W. D. & H. O. Wills).6 'Words' include abbreviations, initials and numbers. The display of company colours may or may not be permitted under the Act and is governed by the particular situation and by the provisions of the Act, inparticular, whether it is a knowing or reckless broadcast or publication of a tobacco advertisement,whether it is encompassed by the section 9 definition of 'tobacco advertisement' etc. See Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 , s. 9(1). 7 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 , s. 8.31any benefit for so broadcasting or publishing (clauses 14 and 19 of the Act); the advertisement is contained in a publication printed outside Australia and not principally intended for distribution or use in Australia (clause17); it is point-of-sale advertising which is allowed subject to State or Territory laws, or, if there is no such legislation, subject to regulations(clause 16); it is an advertisement, in relation to a sporting or cultural event, which the Minister for Human Services and Health has specified in the Commonwealth Gazette (clause 18); or the advertisement is not published in the course of manufacture, distribution or sale of tobacco products and is published at anindividual's own initiative and the individual does not receive anybenefit for publishing the advertisement. 2.9 The Act also provides a temporary defence in respect of the publishing prohibition for persons publishing tobacco advertisements arising from a sponsorshipcontract or other legally enforceable arrangement already entered into before 1 April1992. 8 Advertisements may not be published after 31 December 1995, or, for those associated with cricket matches, 30 April 1996. 2.10 The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Act 1995 sought to clarify and address some of the unintended consequences of the 1992 parent Act. The Billamends the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 to confirm that the 1992 Act is not to apply in a way which would exceed the Commonwealth's power. It alsoprovides for the exemption of various types of tobacco advertisements such asadvertisements made in the context of government or political discussion as long asthey do not promote tobacco products, and allows advertisements relating to theinternal management of the business of a manufacturer or retailer of tobaccoproducts. 9 8 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Bill 1992, Explanatory Memorandum . See also Submission No.45, pp.11-12 (W.D. & H.O. Wills). 9 Other exemptions include non-tobacco products which share the same or similar name to a tobacco product, manufacturer, distributor or retailer; the publication of the name of the tobacco manufacturer,distributor or retailer in a telephone directory; and the broadcasting or publication of an advertisementon international air flights. See Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 1994, Parliamentary Bills Digest, p.1.32State/Territory regulations 2.11 State and Territory regulations affecting tobacco product advertising exist in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and the ACT.Voluntary codes continue to operate in Tasmania and Queensland. State and Territorylegislation continues to be relevant even with the passage of the 1992 Commonwealthlegislation. 2.12 While the Commonwealth Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 provides a national baseline of tobacco advertising prohibition, it also provides that thoseStates and Territories with specific legislation can continue to rely on theirlegislation, except where the Commonwealth prohibition is more stringent. Forexample, point-of-sale advertising is governed by State laws where such laws exist.In the absence of specific State laws, Commonwealth regulations govern this form ofadvertising. In addition, some State legislation contains other provisions regulatingthe promotion and sale of tobacco products. 10 Incidental and accidental tobacco advertising 2.13 Some evidence to the inquiry, such as the submission from the Health Department of Western Australia, argued that incidental and accidental advertisingshould be prohibited. 11 As noted before, incidental or accidental broadcast or publication of tobacco advertisements is permitted under the Act. Incidental oraccidental advertising is defined in the Act in sections 14 and 19 in the followingmanner: Section 14 A person may broadcast a tobacco advertisement if: (a) the person broadcasts the advertisement as an accidental or incidental accompaniment to the broadcasting of other matter; and (b) the person does not receive any direct or indirect benefit (whether financial or not) for broadcasting the advertisement (in addition to anydirect or indirect benefit that the person receives for broadcasting the othermatter). 12 10 Submission No.45, p.12 (W.D. & H.O. Wills). 11 Submission No. 51, p.6 (Health Department of Western Australia). Some groups argued that all forms of tobacco advertising should be prohibited. See, for example, Submission No. 53, p.11 (NSW CancerCouncil, Australian Consumers' Association and Public Health Association of Australia). Thissubmission is hereafter referred to as the submission of the NSW Cancer Council. 12 Section 51(v) of the Constitution enables the Commonwealth to legislate on postal, telegraphic, telephonic and like services. This provision enables the Commonwealth to legislate covering everyperson-whether or not the person is a corporation.33Section 19 A person may publish a tobacco advertisement if: (a) the person publishes the advertisement as an accidental or incidental accompaniment to the publication of other matter; and (b) the person does not receive any direct or indirect benefit (whether financial or not) for publishing the advertisement (in addition to any director indirect benefit that the person receives for publishing the othermatter). 13 2.14 Thus broadcasters are permitted to include incidental material which is technically tobacco advertising for example, in a report of a sporting event where tobacco advertising is permitted at the venue. If, however, the broadcaster receivessome benefit for the tobacco advertising, additional to the benefit arising frombroadcasting the sporting event, the tobacco advertisement would not be permitted.Similarly, the Act permits the publication of a tobacco advertisement which ispublished as an accidental or incidental accompaniment to other matter and for whichthe publisher does not receive any benefit additional to that which they receive forpublishing this other material. 14 2.15 Some groups argued that, given the progressive restriction on tobacco advertising, it was inconsistent for the government to permit certain forms ofadvertising to continue. One submission noted that the placement of advertisementsin the print media and the broadcast of these advertisements through events ontelevision 'clearly constitutes, in effect, tobacco advertising'. 15 Another submission stated that the display of cigarette brand names on television 'extends well beyondmatch play, or of anything that could be justified as accidental or incidental'. 16 2.16 One submission noted that many tobacco sponsored events, such as Benson and Hedges cricket and the Australian Grand Prix generate significant mediacoverage. The submission said that in an Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiryinto alleged cigarette advertising during the broadcast of the 1990 Australian GrandPrix, it was estimated that for 17 per cent of the total broadcast time tobaccoadvertising was visible, which raised doubts as to the 'incidental or accidental' natureof the advertising. 17 13 There is no Commonwealth power over publishing. Therefore the Commonwealth must rely on heads of power which are commonly used in the absence of a specific head of power-these powers include thecorporations power, the trade and commerce power, the territories power and the incidental power. 14 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 , sections 14 and 19. 15 Submission No.51, p.5 (Health Department of Western Australia).16 Submission No.11, p.2 (Canberra ASH). See also Submission No.9, p.1 (Ms L. Scholem).17 Submission No.51, p.6 (Health Department of Western Australia).342.17 While concerns were raised during this inquiry in regard to the incidental broadcast of tobacco advertisements in particular, the Committee did not receive anysubstantial evidence on issues relating to the incidental publication of tobaccoadvertisements nor to the question of the accidental broadcast or publication oftobacco advertisements. 2.18 With regard to the incidental depiction of cigarettes and smoking in Australian magazines and other publications a recent study found that, following the ban ontobacco advertising in 1992, the incidental depiction of cigarettes and smoking inAustralian magazines is 'infrequent by any reasonable standard'. 18 The study noted that 'there appears to be a commendable constraint by many Australian magazineeditors in limiting the publication of photographs that show smoking or cigarettes.Some magazines never show smoking, indicating that a goal of total absence ofphotographs of smoking is achievable'. 19 2.19 DHS&H advised the Committee that given the broad ranging definition of 'tobacco advertising' in the Act, which includes any writing, still or moving picture,sign, symbol, or other visual image that gives publicity to, or otherwise promotessmoking or the purchase of a tobacco product, the issue of restricting accidental orincidental advertising is a 'complex' issue. 20 2.20 The Department stated that permitting accidental and incidental advertising is a 'fair compromise' between the health imperative to limit the ability of tobaccocompanies to place paid advertisements in the various forms of media and thebroader need not to restrict or censor the Australian public's access to those media,which may contain non-sponsored portrayals of smoking. 21 2.21 The Department advised the Committee that it is 'unclear' as to the extent to which accidental and incidental advertising is permitted in overseas countries.However, the Department stated that incidental advertising in the form of unpaiddepiction of smoking in films is not prohibited in any country. The Departmentprovided details of the treatment of indirect advertising in New Zealand and Norwayboth of which have a comprehensive approach to advertising controls similar to thatoperating in Australia. In New Zealand, incidental and accidental tobacco advertisingis permitted in relation to the 'dissemination, broadcasting, or exhibition of any film, 18 S. Chapman et al., 'Incidental Depiction of Cigarettes and Smoking in Australian Magazines, 1990- 1993', Australian Journal of Public Health , Vol 19, No.3, 1995, p.314. The study examined the extent of images of smoking or cigarettes in 20 Australian magazines popular among yo ung people or aimed at lower socio-economic groups during three sample periods in 1990 (before the ban), 1991 and 1993(after the ban). 19 ibid., p.313. 20 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.4.21 ibid., p.5.35video recording, or sound recording' and in Norway 'indirect publicity of minor importance' is permitted on radio, television and in films.22 Conclusions 2.22 The Committee believes that the incidental or accidental broadcast or publication of tobacco advertisements should still be permitted under the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 . The Committee considers, however, that the provisions relating to incidental or accidental advertising should be closely monitoredand strictly enforced by the Department of Human Services and Health. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 4. That the provisions of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 relating to incidental or accidental broadcast or publication of tobacco advertisements bestrictly monitored and enforced by the Department of Human Services andHealth. Sponsorship and advertising 2.23 Although advertisement-related sponsorship of the arts and sporting events by tobacco companies still exists, this type of sponsorship will be prohibited under the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 after 31 December 1995 (and after 30 April 1996 for sponsorship associated with cricket matches).23 2.24 Under the Act, however, there is the capacity to exempt particular sporting or cultural events from the ban on tobacco advertising provided an application forexemption satisfies the Minister for Human Services and Health that the event is ofnational significance and that failure to grant the exemption might result in the eventnot being held in Australia. The Act provides that advertising associated with aspecified event which has been notified in the Commonwealth Gazette cannot explicitly promote tobacco products and must comply with any conditions imposedby the Minister on the tobacco advertising permitted at a specified event. 24 2.25 The guidelines issued under Section 18 of the Act provide that, in specifying the conditions to be complied with in publishing tobacco advertisements inconnection with an event, the Minister may take into account the provisions of anyproposed or existing contract and whether the advertisements are necessary to ensurethe event takes place in Australia. The Minister may impose conditions, such as 22 ibid., p.7. 23 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 , section 21. 24 Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, section 18.36limiting advertisements to those necessary to ensure that the event is held in Australia; and excluding external advertisements, advertisements in connection withthe promotion of an event, and advertisements which appear to be directed atchildren. 25 2.26 To date, all 16 applications for exemptions under the Act have been approved by the Minister. These events have included the Whitbread Round the World YachtRace (WA), Adelaide Grand Prix, Telecom Rally Australia (Perth), AustralianLadies' Masters (Queensland), and the Australian Motor Cycle Grand Prix (NSW). 26 2.27 On 21 September 1995, the Minister for Human Services and Health announced a review of the provision for exempting sporting events of internationalsignificance under Section 18 of the Act. The terms of reference are to review theprovision with regard to 'its consistency with the principles and objectives of thelegislation; and the relevance to sporting events of international significance inAustralia'. The review will assess options for retaining, modifying or removing theprovision. 27 2.28 Several submissions to the inquiry, including submissions from the Australian Medical Association (AMA), National Heart Foundation, ASH Australia, andACOSH argued that the Act should be amended to remove the exemption provisionspermitting tobacco advertising sponsorship of sporting and cultural events. 28 The AMA stated that tobacco sponsorship was 'simply a method of getting aroundadvertising bans'. 29 Another submission noted that tobacco advertising is 'alive and well' in the form of exempted events, such as the Grand Prix.30 2.29 In other submissions it was argued that exemptions for tobacco sponsorships should be limited as much as possible and that, where exemptions are granted, theCommonwealth Government should develop stringent conditions. 31 In granting an exemption for tobacco advertising at the 1996 Melbourne Grand Prix the Ministerapplied the most stringent conditions ever applied by the CommonwealthGovernment to such an event. Tobacco advertising will only be permitted where itrelates to existing international contracts for track signage and sponsorship of teams 25 Guidelines cited in R. Furlong, 'Tobacco Advertising Legislation and the Sponsorship of Sport', Australian Business Law Review , Vol. 22(3), June 1994, p.170. 26 Submission No. 54, p.2 (AMA).27 Minister for Human Services and Health, News Release , 21 September 1995. The review is expected to be completed by 30 April 1996. 28 See Submission No.54, p.2 (AMA); Submission No 42, p.3 (National (ASH Australia); No.29, p.13 (ACOSH). The AMA recommended that thelegislation providing exemptions should be tightened in the short term and that sponsorships should notbe permitted in the longer term. 29 Submission Submission No.41, p.8 Submission No.54, p.2 (AMA).37and drivers. Signage other than that associated with the driving teams will be required to carry health warnings, and will be required to occupy at least 25 per cent of thetotal area of each sign. Advertising away from the track will be prohibited, as willperipheral advertising such as models handing out cigarettes. 32 2.30 Studies have shown that sponsorship by tobacco manufacturers of televised sport has the same effect on children as more direct cigarette advertising. Childrenwere found to be better able to identify cigarette brands after watching tobacco-sponsored sporting events than they were before. One United Kingdom study foundthat children were most aware of the cigarette brands which were most frequentlyassociated with sponsored sporting events on television. The study concluded that'TV sport sponsorship by tobacco manufacturers acts as cigarette advertising tochildren and therefore circumvents the law banning cigarette advertisements onTV'. 33 2.31 Another UK study found that over half of the secondary school children in the sample were able to specify a brand name and a sponsored sport or game, such as Marlboro and motor car racing. The study argued that: Many secondary and older primary school children are aware of the connections between cigarette brand names and sports. Moreover, asthe brands and sports most frequently mentioned have often been shownon television, this suggests that children learn about these connectionsby watching televised sporting events. 34 Alternative sponsorship 2.32 The Committee recognises that there need to be viable alternatives to tobacco sponsorship of international sporting or cultural events. There are two sources from which such sponsorship may be obtained private enterprise and the establishment of a national health promotion foundation. It has been noted that non-tobacco privateenterprise companies have the opportunity to move into the sponsorship of highexposure sports such as cricket, rugby league and motor racing. There is, however,the possibility that individual companies may be unable or unwilling to completelyreplace the tobacco sponsorship, given the large sums involved in such sponsorships.It was also pointed out that such companies may have to rationalise their previous 32 Minister for Human Services and Health, News Release , 20 September 1995. 33 F.

These foundations currently exist in Victoria, South Australia, WesternAustralia and the ACT. 2.34 The Victorian Health Promotion Foundation, VicHealth, sponsors over 140 sports and an equivalent number of arts and cultural activities. 36 This funding has enabled a number of sports in Victoria, including tennis, soccer and football, as wellas opera, ballet and the visual arts, to be 'completely free of tobacco sponsorship'. 37 VicHealth is funded by a levy of up to 5 per cent on the wholesale sales of tobaccoproducts in Victoria (the levy raises $22 million annually). A national foundationcould be supported by a levy on tobacco products at the Commonwealth level, similarto the levy which funds VicHealth. 38 In a document produced by the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, it was also indicated that it may be necessary toinvestigate the availability of alternative sources of funding for sponsorship,including other corporate bodies and governments. 39 Conclusions 2.35 The Committee believes that, on the basis of the evidence received from a wide range of groups and of studies that show sponsorship by tobacco manufacturersacts as cigarette advertising to children, there should be no special exemptionpermitting tobacco advertising at sporting and cultural events of internationalsignificance. The Committee further believes this recommendation should be phasedin by the year 2000. 2.36 This Committee also believes that the Commonwealth government should establish a national health promotion foundation or other appropriate national body toprovide an alternative source of sponsorship funding. This foundation could befunded by an increase in the tobacco excise. 35 Furlong, op. cit., p.177. 36 ibid., p.178. 37 Submission (Victorian Health Promotion Foundation).38 Furlong, op. cit., p.182. 39 National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, National Health Policy on Tobacco in Australia , March 1991, p.10.39Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS: 5. That the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 be amended to remove the provision for the exemption of publication of tobacco advertisements inassociation with specified sporting and cultural events of internationalsignificance and that this be phased in by the year 2000. 6. That the Commonwealth Government establish a national health promotion foundation or other appropriate national body to provide an alternative source ofsponsorship funding to that provided by tobacco companies for major sportingand cultural events. Regulation of the level of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide 2.37 Some evidence received during the inquiry suggested that there should be greater regulation of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes.40 Australian tobacco manufacturers and importers entered into a voluntary agreementin 1982 to set maximum levels of tar and nicotine allowed in cigarettes. In 1982 theupper limits were 18 mg of corrected particulate matter (CPM or tar) and 1.6 mg ofnicotine per cigarette. The agreement was renegotiated in 1986 to cover carbonmonoxide content and at the same time maximum yields of tar and nicotine werereduced. In 1988 the permissible levels were reduced further and remain today at14 mg tar, 1.4 mg nicotine and 18 mg carbon monoxide. 2.38 The Trade Practices (Consumer Product Information Standards) (Tobacco) Regulations, introduced on 29 March 1994, require tobacco products to carryinformation about their tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content, specifically theaverage yields (levels) of these substances and an explanation of their healtheffects. 41 2.39 Some evidence to the Committee suggested that the nicotine content of tobacco products should be reduced further because of the addictive properties ofnicotine. ACOSH argued that if the nicotine content of cigarettes were reduced therisks of addiction among young people may also be reduced. 42 The organisation suggested that a plan for the systematic reduction in the nicotine content of cigarettesbe implemented so that the maximum nicotine content per cigarette would be 0.1 mgof nicotine by the year 2004. Another submission noted that 'reducing nicotinecontent in cigarettes to non-addictive levels is possible, given the recent admissions 40 Submission No. 29, p.12 (ACOSH). 41 Submission No.27, section 4.10 (DHS&H).42 Submission No.29, p.12 (ACOSH).40by the tobacco industry that they have the technology to alter the nicotine content of their product'.43 2.40 Other evidence to the Committee, however, questioned whether additional regulation in this area was required. DHS&H stated that the level of nicotine inAustralian cigarettes is 'very low compared to cigarettes from other countries, andthere is no evidence that the levels are increasing'. 44 A representative of the Department added that 'the smoke yield tables that we have been publishing do notshow any evidence of an increase in the level of nicotine in cigarettes sold inAustralia. There do not appear to be any across-the-board incremental increases in thelevel of nicotine in the products being sold in our cigarettes'. 45 2.41 Some evidence suggests that some benefits may be gained in health terms in smoking low tar/nicotine cigarettes. One United States study reported a 40 per centreduction in the risk of developing lung cancer in women with the use of lowtar/nicotine cigarettes, keeping the number of cigarettes smoked per day constant. 46 One witness stated that while some health benefits may be gained by using low taryield cigarettes, these benefits may be less than expected. The witness stated that 'theexpected benefits in terms of reductions in blood nicotine levels are lower becauserelatively they [smokers] over-smoke, inhale deeper, harder, longer. So you do notreap all the potential benefit that there is there; but some benefit is gained'. 47 2.42 DHS&H advised the Committee that further regulation of nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide levels may not be the most effective strategy in that it gives the 'wrong message' that is, it creates the impression that there is a potentially 'safer cigarette'. The Department noted that its strategy is focused on 'not reducing thenicotine or carbon monoxide, but telling the community what the nicotine and thecarbon monoxide do to your body and that it is a poison'. 48 Since January 1995 new labelling regulations have required a fuller explanation of tar, nicotine and carbonmonoxide content of cigarettes and their health effects. The information on cigarettepacks is now required to state that 'the smoke from each cigarette contains, onaverage, 12 milligrams or less of tar-condensed smoke containing many chemicals, including some that cause cancer; 1.2 milligrams or less of nicotine a poisonous and addictive drug; 10 milligrams or less of carbon monoxide a deadly gas which reduces the ability of blood to carry oxygen'. 43 Submission No.41, p.6 (ASH Australia).

The results of the testing program have shown that fewercigarettes contain high levels of tar, nicotine or carbon monoxide and a greaternumber of cigarettes contain low levels of these substances. 49 The Department stated that 'there is no evidence to suggest that the Commonwealth needs to invokelegislation to control or limit the levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide incigarettes'. 50 DHS&H also noted that the approach in overseas countries varies. While New Zealand does not regulate tar, nicotine or carbon monoxide levels incigarettes (although they have the capacity to do so under the Smoke-Free Environments Act 1990 ), the United States Food and Drug Administration has been considering a proposal to regulate nicotine, although it has not been implemented atthis stage. 2.44 The Committee believes that the Department's approach to the regulation of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in tobacco products needs to be re-assessed.While the Department suggests that its strategy is focused more on discouragingtobacco consumption and less on further regulation of tar and nicotine levels incigarettes it has, nevertheless been involved in negotiations that have resulted inreductions in the tar and nicotine levels of cigarettes through the operation of thevoluntary agreement. 51 In addition, given the possible health benefits for smokers of changing to low tar/nicotine cigarettes, an approach that focused on tar/nicotinereduction may be beneficial for many smokers. This would be especially the case as a strategy for encouraging a reduction in overall tobacco use is a long term goal. 52 2.45 The Committee believes that the regulation of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes needs to be considered in the broader context of theclassification of tobacco products as a poison. The Committee discusses this issuefurther in paragraphs 2.50 to 2.60. Measuring tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels 2.46 An issue of concern raised during the inquiry was the adequacy of the method of testing cigarette yields.53 The yield information which is on the side of cigarette packs refers to the yields which have been obtained by a standardised protocol agreedto by the government and the tobacco manufacturers. Smoking machines are used tomeasure yields of nicotine, tar and carbon monoxide by programming them to deliver 49 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.9. 50 ibid. 51 See paragraph 2.37.52 See paragraph 2.41.53 Cigarette yields refer to the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels present in cigarettes. See Submission No.42, p.4 (National Heart Foundation); Submission No.41, p.7 (ASH Australia).42a 35 ml, two-second puff every minute from each cigarette tested, with ventilation holes left unblocked. 2.47 One witness noted, however, that research into what smokers actually do when smoking indicates a process which differs markedly from the process used in thetests. The witness stated that: In fact machines do not smoke like people, and we know from clinical and experimental studies that when smokers move to lower nicotineyielding brands...they compensate. They take more puffs, they inhalemore deeply, they smoke more cigarettes, they smoke the cigarettedown further to the butt and they crush the cigarette, thereby destroyingsome of the filtration properties of that cigarette. And, moreimportantly, they also in some cases...put their fingers either partially orwholly over the ventilation holes...and thereby block air coming into the cigarette and thereby increase the volume of nicotine, tar ...which they are inhaling. 54 2.48 One submission cited a study reported in Choice magazine in 1993 in which tests were performed on a selection of Australian cigarette brands using the industrytesting standard. The results showed that when the ventilation holes were halfblocked, tar yields increased by an average of 74 per cent and nicotine yields by anaverage of 51 per cent. Increases when the holes were fully blocked were evenhigher. With the doubling of the puff frequency, tar yields increased in the brandstested by an average of 107 per cent and nicotine yields by 73 per cent. 55 2.49 The doubts expressed in evidence to the Committee concerning aspects of the yield testing procedures and the variable amounts of substances absorbed by smokershas led the Committee to believe that the testing procedures need to accurately reflectdifferences in smoking behaviours. 56 Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 7. That the current testing procedures for cigarette yields be reviewed by an appropriate independent body to determine whether these procedures accuratelyreflect the actual levels of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide inhaled bysmokers; and that the printed material contained on cigarette packs on tar,nicotine and carbon monoxide yield levels reflects this information. 54 Transcript of Evidence , pp.268-69 (NSW Cancer Council). 55 Submission Council).56 See paragraph 2.41.43Classification of nicotine as a poison 2.50 Some evidence to the Committee suggested that nicotine in tobacco products should be listed as a scheduled poison.57 One witness stated that 'we still have illogical and inconsistent provisions concerning nicotine ... nicotine is listed ... as adangerous poison except in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking. This is a majorinconsistency in our laws concerning smoking'. 58 2.51 The Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons is issued by the National Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee. It classifies drugs and poisonsinto Schedules for inclusion in the relevant States and Territories legislation. 59 State and Territory poisons inspectors monitor and enforce the legislation. The Standardlists poisons in eight Schedules according to the degree of control recommended tobe exercised over their availability to the public. Poisons are classified as follows: Schedule 1 Currently vacant. Schedule 2 Poisons for therapeutic use that should be available to the public only from pharmacies; or where there is no pharmacy service available, frompersons licensed to sell Schedule 2 poisons. Schedule 3 Poisons for therapeutic use that are dangerous or are so liable to abuse as to warrant their availability to the public being restricted to supply bypharmacists or medical, dental or veterinary practitioners. Schedule 4 Poisons that should, in the public interest, be restricted to medical, dental or veterinary prescription or supply, together with substances orpreparations intended for therapeutic use, the safety or efficacy of whichrequires further evaluation. Schedule 5 Poisons of a hazardous nature that must be readily available to the public but require caution in handling, storage and use. Schedule 6 Poisons that must be available to the public but are of a more hazardous or poisonous nature than those classified in Schedule 5. 57 Transcript of Evidence , pp.362-3 (ACOSH). 58 ibid. 59 The Committee considers submissions for additions or alterations to the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons and undertakes policy development, harmonisation of poisons/drugslabelling requirements between Australia and New Zealand and other tasks associated with the publichealth aspects of the scheduling of drugs and poisons. The Committee comprises expert scientists,government representatives of the States, Territories and New Zealand and Commonwealth registrationagencies for drugs and agricultural and veterinary chemicals, and includes industry, pharmacy andconsumer representatives. See Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons , No. 10, AGPS, Canberra, 1995, pp.v, ix-x.44Schedule 7 Poisons which require special precautions in manufacturing, handling, storage or use, or special individual regulations regarding labelling oravailability. Schedule 8 Poisons to which the restrictions recommended for drugs of dependence by the 1980 Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugsshould apply. Schedule 9 Poisons which are drugs of abuse, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except for amounts which maybe necessary for medical or scientific research conducted with the approval ofCommonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities. 60 2.52 Nicotine is currently listed as a Schedule 7 poison in the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Drugs and Poisons 61 'except in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking'.62 DHS&H advised the Committee that the exemption of tobacco in the Schedule 'is historical and reflects the prevalence of smoking in the community'.63 As noted above, Schedule 7 poisons are those which 'require special precautions inmanufacturing, handling, storage or use, or special individual regulations regardinglabelling or availability'. 64 2.53 Poisons for therapeutic use (drugs) are scheduled in Schedules 2, 3 and 8 with progression through schedules signifying increasingly strict controls. For agricultural,domestic and industrial poisons Schedules 5, 6 and 7 represent increasingly strictcontainer and labelling requirements with special regulatory controls over theavailability of poisons listed in Schedule 7. 65 2.54 Poisons are not scheduled on the basis of a universal scale of toxicity. Although toxicity is one of the factors considered, and is itself a complex of factors,'the decision to include a substance in a particular Schedule also takes into account 60 ibid., pp.vii, 37-39. 61 Nicotine is also exempted from Schedule 7 when included in Schedules 3, 4 or 6. Products containing nicotine for therapeutic (drug) use are categorised as Schedule 3 and 4 poisons. Included in theseschedules is nicotine chewing gum, an aid in withdrawal from nicotine addiction. Schedule 3 covers the2 milligram Nicorette tablets used for smoking cessation which is available without prescription frompharmacists. Schedule 4 covers the 4 milligram Nicorette tablets, along with other products containingnicotine intended as an aid in tobacco withdrawal and available on prescription from a medicalpractitioner. Schedule 6 refers to nicotine used in animal preparations. See ibid., pp.59, 98, and 152; and Transcript of Evidence , p.362 (ACOSH). 62 Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, op. cit., p.168. 63 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.10.64 Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council, op. cit., p.vii. 65 ibid., p.ix.45many other criteria such as the purpose of use, potential for abuse, safety in use and the need for the substance'.66 2.55 The Standard also includes model provisions about labels and packaging and recommendations about controls on drugs and poisons. The labelling requirementsfor Schedule 7 poisons require that they state 'Dangerous Poisons' and 'Keep Out ofReach of Children'; the approved name of the poison and the quantity, proportion orstrength of the poison; and the name of the manufacturer or distributor or the brandname or trade name by the manufacturer or distributor for the poison. 67 2.56 The Standard also lists conditions for the availability and use of Schedule 7 poisons. The conditions for availability and use depend on the nature of the poison.Some Schedule 7 poisons are severely restricted, although others are less severelyrestricted. 68 2.57 It has been argued that listing nicotine in tobacco products under the poisons schedule would be advantageous. It has been claimed that it 'would givegovernments full control of the packaging and content of cigarettes' and that'governments could enforce generic packaging for all brands. Health warnings couldbe regulated to any required size, as could the delivery of nicotine and carcinogenictars'. 69 2.58 Evidence from DHS&H suggested that 'scheduling', as a means of regulatory control of drugs and poisons or as a means of achieving desirable health outcomes isnot an automatic, nor necessarily the best, choice for governments. 70 The Department argued that in the case of tobacco, other methods, such as demand reduction in theform of educational campaigns, high taxation of tobacco products, warning labels,and financial support for other anti-smoking initiatives, are more appropriate.DHS&H stated that 'this strategy excludes scheduling as a supply-reduction measure,because the habit is so widespread in the community and restrictive scheduling wouldbe difficult to implement. Prohibitive scheduling of tobacco has the potential tocreate social problems similar to those experienced when outright prohibition ofalcohol was attempted in the USA'. 71 2.59 The Committee notes that in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently ruled that nicotine is an addictive drug, which willenable the agency to regulate tobacco as a drug. 72 Although the FDA has yet to detail 66 ibid. 67 ibid., pp.6, 20. 68 ibid., pp.236-43. 69 Australian Medicine , 7 August 1995, p.1. 70 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.10.71 ibid. 72 'Nicotine is Addictive, Rules FDA', British Medical Journal , Vol. 311, 22 July 1995, p.211.46what form the regulation would take, one report noted that the regulatory regime could include measures such as gradually lowering the nicotine levels allowed incigarettes until they fall below the threshold at which the chemical causes addictionin smokers. 73 Conclusions 2.60 The Committee believes that nicotine when used in tobacco products should be listed as a Schedule 7 poison under the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling ofDrugs and Poisons, but considers that a review into the overall impact the proposalwould have on the availability of tobacco products is warranted before theintroduction of such a measure. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 8. That, while the Committee favours the listing of nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking as a Schedule 7 poison by the National Drugs andPoisons Schedule Committee, it believes that further investigation of the implications of this proposal should be undertaken by the Council of AustralianGovernments and the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council. Additives in cigarettes 2.61 In addition to concerns raised in relation to the level of tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide in cigarettes, the issue of substances added to tobacco products (additives)was raised during the inquiry. Currently there are no government regulations relatingto the use of ingredients (additives) added to tobacco products in Australia, and thislack may have serious consequences. 2.62 One submission from a tobacco company stated that tobacco used in cigarettes commercially manufactured in Australia and in the United States has alwayscontained flavouring ingredients (the most common of which are sugars), as well asprocessing aids. 74 Another submission from a tobacco company stated that ingredients are primarily used as flavourings, although they also act as casingmaterials or processing aids. Flavours, such as menthol, are an integral part oftobacco products, and are used to refine and contribute to the taste and distinctivenessof many brands of tobacco products. Casing materials such as sugar or honey areused to smooth the taste. Humectants or moisturisers are used to keep tobacco moist. 73 'Regulating Tobacco', Congressional Quarterly Researcher, Vol.4, No.36, No.44, p.8 (Philip Morris).47A small number of processing aids, such as water and carbon dioxide are used for a number of purposes in meeting specific design requirements.75 2.63 Evidence to the Committee raised several concerns in relation to additives. These included the nature of the ingredients that are added to cigarettes and theirpossible health effects, and the related questions of the right of both governments andconsumers to have access to appropriate information about such additives. 2.64 One submission noting the possible harmful effects of additives argued that questions arise as to whether, and to what extent, the chemical additives 'thatadulterate commercial tobacco products exacerbate the harmful effects of smokingtobacco', given that nicotine itself is harmful to health. 76 It was noted, for example, that the impact of flavourants, such as menthol, which play a role in making cigarettes more 'palatable' to young smokers (especially girls who often find the harsher taste of regular cigarettes unpleasant) needs to be examined.77 One submission stated that the role of flavourants in the 'recruitment' of young smokersneeds to be examined. 78 One study stated that while additives may be innocuous in themselves they may become toxic when subjected to the heat produced by lighting acigarette. The study noted that 'a burning cigarette quickly converts from a tobaccostore-house to a chemical factory, producing 4 000 compounds. Of these, 400,including nicotine and carbon monoxide, are toxins, and another 40 arecarcinogens'. 79 2.65 The Committee also raised the issue of the possible effect additives may have on the nicotine levels in cigarettes. DHS&H advised the Committee that it was notaware on any conclusive evidence on this issue. 80 The Committee believes that the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) should investigate thehealth effects of tobacco products to determine if additives potentiate the effects ofnicotine. 2.66 Information supplied by Philip Morris provided details of an evaluation by six scientists of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes in theUnited States. The authors independently examined extensive published andunpublished toxicologic and other data on the ingredients added to cigarette tobaccoand found 'none to be potentially toxic at levels of use'. The evaluation concluded 75 Submission No.45, p.17 (W. D. & H. O. Wills). 76 Submission Engineering News , 28 November 1994, p.9. 80 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.12.48that the ingredients used by the six major US manufacturers 'are not hazardous under the conditions of use'.81 2.67 DHS&H advised the Committee that Commonwealth and State Health Ministers considered the question of additives in 1992 and concluded that the healthrisks from known additives were not significant and that further action to providemore consumer information on tobacco additives was not justified. 82 This decision was based on the findings of a study by the Centre for Behavioural Research inCancer on issues relating to additives and pesticides in tobacco. It was decided thatthe provision of any additional information (to that currently being provided on tar,carbon monoxide and nicotine) would most probably confuse consumers or neutralisethe impact of other health information on tobacco packs. The Department noted thatthis view was endorsed by the NHMRC which indicated that it would not be preparedto set maximum levels for pesticides and additives in tobacco. 83 The position of the NHMRC was that the health consequences of potentially dangerous additives werelikely to be insignificant when compared to the harm caused by the naturallyoccurring toxic contents of tobacco itself. 84 2.68 The Committee sought information from the tobacco companies on the ingredients added to cigarettes in Australia, and this information was provided on aconfidential basis. The list detailed 599 ingredients added to tobacco in productsmanufactured by the companies in Australia; Wills also advised the Committee thattwo additional ingredients (not included in the original list provided) are used in themanufacture of that company's cigarettes. 85 While the Committee is not in a position to make a comprehensive assessment of the nature and possible health effects of thelist of additives provided, it believes that the ingredients as used (i.e. in combinationand in conditions of use) should be subject to an independent review by anappropriate medical/scientific body. The Committee believes that such a course ofaction would address many of the concerns expressed during the inquiry in relation tothe use of additives. 2.69 Evidence to the Committee suggested that governments should have access to information on those ingredients which are added to cigarettes so that they can makeinformed decisions concerning any possible adverse health effects. One witnessstated that 'public authorities need to know what they all are [additives] and to makesome independent judgements as to why they are there and their likely effects, if any, 81 Cited in letter from Philip Morris to the Committee, dated 6 March 1995, p.8. 82 This decision was reaffirmed by the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy in June 1995. See letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.12. 83 ibid., p.11.84 ibid.85 Letters from Philip Morris to the Committee, dated 6 March 1995; Rothmans to the Committee, dated 30 March 1995; Wills to the Committee, dated 31 March 1995.49on the public health'.86 Another witness also noted, 'we do not know what goes into cigarettes and I believe that, like any other consumer product that is taken into the body pharmaceuticals, beverages, foodstuffs the government, at the very least, ought to be told what is going into these products'.87 2.70 Information on tobacco additives is provided to the United States and New Zealand Governments by tobacco companies on a confidential basis. In New Zealand,the government requires tobacco companies to provide to the Health Department, onan annual basis, a list of all additives that they use in their tobacco products. As notedabove, the list is not released to the public and does not specify which additives areselected from the list for use. 88 The Committee believes that the tobacco companies operating in Australia should also be required to provide to the CommonwealthGovernment annually a list of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobaccoproducts. 2.71 Several submissions also raised the issue of the need for consumers, as well as governments, to be informed about the ingredients added to tobacco products. Onewitness stated that 'every consumer deserves to know what is in a product,particularly a product that they ingest. I can purchase a jelly off the supermarket shelfand on the side of the packet will be a list of what is in it. I can purchase cigarettesand I do not know what I am going to ingest when I smoke that cigarette'. 89 Witnesses also noted that in addition to a consumer's 'right to know', information onadditives was essential in helping consumers make an informed choice as to whether or not to smoke 'while information is withheld from them, their choice is not fully informed'. 90 2.72 The tobacco companies argue that to disclose the additives used in the manufacture of cigarettes would be to disclose commercially sensitive materialpotentially damaging to a particular company. 91 Others, however, have argued that smokers select brands more on the basis of price and brand image, than on the basisof taste. One submission stated that 'there would be little to be gained by anycompany copying the chemical profile of another brand and thereby hoping to gainmarket share on the assumption that smokers switch [brands] on the basis of taste'(although taste is presumably one factor involved in brand switching). 92 The Committee believes that consumers have a right to know what ingredients are added 86 Transcript of Evidence , p.148 (National Heart Foundation). 87 Transcript of Evidence , p.270 (NSW Cancer Council). 88 Submission Council).89 Transcript of Evidence , p.664 (ASH Australia). 90 Transcript of Evidence , p.147 (National Heart Foundation). 91 Transcript of Evidence , p.487 (Philip Morris). 92 Submission No.53, p.7 (NSW Cancer Council).50to cigarettes, and that this right to know outweighs the commercial considerations advanced by the tobacco companies. 2.73 The Committee questioned witnesses on the appropriate form any disclosure of additives might take. Witnesses suggested that, depending on the number ofadditives used, they could be either listed on the side of the cigarette pack or, if thiswere not feasible, the additives could be listed on a fold-out piece of paper insertedinside the cigarette pack. 93 Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS: 9. That the National Health and Medical Research Council assess the health effects of tobacco product additives, including determining whether additivespotentiate the effects of nicotine. 10. That a list of the ingredients added to tobacco products be provided annually to the Commonwealth Government, on a confidential basis, by those tobaccocompanies whose products are available for sale in Australia. 11. That a list of the ingredients in tobacco products, and their effects, be distributed (in an appropriate form) with all tobacco products sold in Australia. Excise arrangements 2.74 During the inquiry several contributors including ACOSH, ASH Australia, National Heart Foundation and the NSW Cancer Council argued that there should bea change to the basis of calculating excise for cigarettes from the present 'weight'based system to a 'per stick' basis. 94 2.75 Excise duties may be levied on the basis of the value, volume or weight of a product. Currently, the excise duty levied on tobacco in Australia is determinedaccording to the weight of the manufactured tobacco product. In relation tocigarettes, excise is levied on the total weight of the cigarette (including paper andfilter). 95 A sticks-based excise system would levy a tax according to the number of cigarette products sold. A flat rate would apply to each 'stick', whether a large cigaror a light-weight cigarette. As with the current weight-based system, the amount ofexcise would be independent of the value of the product. 93 Transcript of Evidence , pp.147-8 (National Heart Foundation); Transcript of Evidence Cancer Council). 94 No.29, p.14 (ACOSH); No. 41, p.8 (ASH Australia); Submission No. 42, p.4 (National Heart Foundation); Submission No. 53, p.9 (NSW Cancer Council). 95 Industry Commission, The Tobacco Growing and Manufacturing Industries , AGPS, Canberra, 1994, p.85.512.76 Several health groups, proposing a change to the 'per stick' system, have argued that the weight-based system encourages the sale of larger packs, (such aspacks of 30s, 35s, 40s and 50s) and that these packs are becoming popular with lowincome groups and children because they are perceived as offering 'better value' interms of a cheaper price per stick. 96 One submission noted that 'the concern here is that, with many smokers pacing their purchasing behaviour and daily consumption bythe pack, that the extra cigarettes in larger packs, while lighter in tobacco per stick,encourage the smoker to smoke more cigarettes'. 97 2.77 DHS&H argued, however, that data from the 1993 National Drug Strategy household survey indicated that the availability of larger packs did not necessarilyresult in smokers consuming more cigarettes. 98 As noted in paragraph 3.22, the evidence also suggests that adolescents use the smaller packs not the larger packs as suggested by several health groups. For example, among 12-to 17-year olds themost popular cigarette packet size is the 25s, followed by the packs of 30s. The 50pack size is used by only 5 per cent of 12-to 17-year olds, although younger studentsuse this pack size to a greater extent than older students (9 per cent of 12-year oldsuse cigarettes from packets of 50s, whereas only 2 per cent of 17- year olds do so). 99 2.78 One tobacco company Wills also proposed a change to a per stick excise system. The company, arguing from a production and economic viewpoint, stated thata per stick system would improve production efficiencies and complement theongoing efforts to improve productivity and structural efficiency in the industry;encourage product quality improvements; provide a less complicated system toadminister; provide a more predictable tax base; and be in line with the tax regimesfor tobacco products in other OECD countries. 100 The company also conceded that there would be some financial advantage for the company in a change to a 'per stick'excise arrangement. 101 2.79 The other two companies (Philip Morris and Rothmans) did not support a change from the current excise arrangements. A representative of Rothmans arguedthat the company did not consider that a change in the tax regime would result in a'reduced incidence of smoking through the elimination of cheaper price per cigarettebrands and larger packs'. 102 The representative argued that 'we do not agree that the large packs encourage smoking by juveniles as has been suggested. Our marketresearch shows that the 40 to 44 age group is the most attracted to the value for 96 Submission No.53, p.9 (NSW Cancer Council); Submission No. 41, p.7 (ASH Australia). 97 Submission No.53, p.9 (NSW Cancer Council).

The Commission argued that such a system would biasproduction and consumption decisions in favour of longer, and thicker tobaccoproducts. 105 A representative of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria responding to these concerns argued that it is 'unlikely' that it would result in 'heavier' cigarettes, 'only one other country in the world ...excises by weight and in every country of the world the average weight of cigarettes has come down, I think largely due toconsumer preference for low tar brands'. 106 Wills also noted that a longer and thicker type of cigarette was subject to trials in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, but therewas not sufficient consumer demand for the product. It was also noted that provisionssimilar to those in the European Union could be introduced so that cigarettes beyonda certain length or weight are taxed at a higher rate. 107 2.81 One submission noted that it is sometimes argued that a per stick excise will result in higher tar and nicotine deliveries. The submission noted that this would notbe the case as tar and nicotine deliveries are determined by product design to meetconsumer demand. It was noted that consumer demand has resulted in cigarettesdelivering 8 mg or less of tar and such cigarettes have increased their market sharefrom 8.6 per cent in 1980 to 51.8 per cent in 1994. It was also noted that tar andnicotine deliveries are not dependent on the amount of tobacco contained in thecigarette. 108 2.82 DHS&H advised the Committee that a joint review by the Departments of Human Services and Health and the Treasury in 1995 into the manner in whichtobacco excise is currently levied, concluded that there was no basis for supporting achange to the excise levy, from a weight-based to a sticks-based system from a healthperspective and that such a change would involve considerable disruption toindustry. 109 103 ibid., p.590. 104 While the excise per cigarette may be higher for some larger packs, the price to consumers per cigarette in the larger packs may be less than the price per cigarette in smaller packs due to price discounting. 105 Industry Commission, op. cit., Appendix N, p.3. 106 Transcript of Evidence , p.87 (Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria). 107 Supplementary Submission ( W.

Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 12. That the National Health and Medical Research Council appoint a sub- committee to review the current weight-based excise system. Duty-free tobacco products 2.84 Currently persons over the age of 18 years entering Australia are permitted to bring into the country 250 grams of tobacco products (or 250 cigarettes) without thepayment of duty. 110 2.85 A recent review of the Australian Customs Service recommended that in the light of the Government's general policy of discouraging the use of tobacco productsthe Commonwealth Government should consider withdrawing tobacco products from the list of duty-free goods. 111 The review noted that several groups, including the AMA had pointed out 'the anomaly of Government policies discouraging smokingwhile exempting [these] tobacco products from duty'. 112 2.86 The Committee believes that the Commonwealth Government should further investigate the implications of withdrawing tobacco products from the list of duty-free items. The Committee understands that Singapore has recently withdrawn the duty-free status of tobacco products . 113 110 For Australian Customs purposes, 250 cigarettes are equivalent to 250 grams. Currently, persons may bring with them goods over and above their 'allowance', including tobacco products, as long as thesegoods are declared and any duty owing is paid.

The Committee, by focusing on young people, recognises that smoking in adolescence sets the pattern for subsequent tobacco use. Discouraging young people from starting to use tobacco is the key to reducing tobacco-related death and disease in later life . The first section of the chapter discusses the reasons why young people take up smoking and the incidence of smoking amongst young people. The secondsection discusses possible approaches in addressing the problem of juvenile smoking,and recommends several options to address this problem. Why adolescents smoke 3.2 Evidence to the Committee and research, both in Australia and overseas, indicate that young people take up smoking for a variety of reasons.Sociodemographic, environmental, behavioural and personal factors can encouragethe onset of tobacco use among adolescents. Among the strongest influences on thedecision by a young person to smoke are those created by peer pressure, by the socialenvironment and the family environment in which the young person lives. 1 3.3 Research in the United States has indicated that the initiation and development of tobacco use among children and adolescents progresses through a number ofstages: from forming attitudes and beliefs about smoking, from trying, experimentingwith, and regularly using tobacco, to nicotine dependence and addiction. The processfrom the initial 'try' to the stage of regular use takes on average two to three years,although there is considerable variation among individuals. 2 3.4 Data from the United States indicate that experimentation with tobacco begins in early adolescence, typically by the age of 16 years. The ages between 11 to 15 havebeen identified as the peak age groups for trial and experimentation associated withcigarettes. 3 An Australian study conducted in 1989-90 found that the majority (60 per cent) of both current smokers and ex-smokers reported that they began experimentingwith smoking between the ages of 15 and 19 years. A further 17 per cent of currentsmokers and 15 per cent of ex-smokers started experimenting before the age of15 years. 4 1 US Department of Health and Human Services, Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People: A Report of the Surgeon General, US Government Printing Office, Washington D.C., 1994, pp.125-38. 2 ibid., pp.124-25. 3 ibid., pp.104, 138. 4 ABS, Australian Social Trends 1994 , Cat. No. 4102.0, p.60.563.5 Research in Australia indicates that where people had reached the age of 20 years and had not smoked, the chance of their taking up smoking was slim. Only 12per cent of those who had ever smoked began smoking regularly after the age of 21years. Almost 80 per cent of adults who had ever smoked had taken it up by the ageof 20 years. 5 Similar results have been reported in the United States, where research indicates that few adolescents commence smoking after the age of 18 years.6 3.6 As noted above, a number of risk factors are associated with the initiation of smoking in young people. Sociodemographic factors are associated with the onset ofsmoking. Studies have shown that adolescents from families from lowersocioeconomic groups; from families where the level of parental educational is low;or where the adolescent is living in a single-parent household, have a higherincidence of smoking than where these factors are not present. One possibleexplanation of the impact of socioeconomic status and smoking is that youth fromlower socioeconomic backgrounds may have to cope more often with stressfulsituations, such as lacking sufficient resources or living in a one-parent household,and therefore perceive smoking as a quick, easy, coping strategy for stress orloneliness. These youths may also be more susceptible to peer group influences and advertising. Adolescents from low-income families may also have more role models who smoke and less supervision to discourage experimentation than adolescents fromhigher-income families. 7 3.7 Environmental risk factors for tobacco use include accessibility and availability of tobacco products (especially through advertising and promotion bytobacco companies); perceptions by adolescents that tobacco use is 'cool'; peers' andsiblings' use and approval of tobacco use; and lack of parental support andinvolvement as adolescents face the challenges of growing up. 8 3.8 Behavioural risk factors associated with tobacco use include low levels of academic achievement and school involvement, lack of skills required to resistinfluences to use tobacco and experimentation with tobacco products. These riskfactors are also associated with sociodemographic factors. 9 Personal risk factors for tobacco use include a lower self image than peers; the belief that tobacco use is'functional' (i.e. as a way to act mature, be accepted by a peer group or coping with 5 Unpublished data from the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, dated 8 November 1995. The data are based on a study of the smoking behaviour of adults in Victoria conducted in 1993. 6 US Surgeon General, 'Preventing Tobacco Use Among Young People', Tobacco Control , 3, 1994, p.176. 7 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.127. 8 ibid., pp.125-32. 9 A US study reports that youth from lower socio-economic status families are limited by fewer opportunities for health enhancing avenues for independence and identity, often lack parentalsupervision and are at greater risk of beginning smoking than youth from higher socio-economicfamilies. See ibid., p.138.57personal problems); and lack of personal self-confidence in the ability to refuse offers to use cigarettes.10 3.9 Adolescent smoking behaviour has been shown to be a risk factor for subsequent smoking.11 Several US studies have found that 'intentions to smoke' (ie. a clear intent to smoke) have been associated with both the onset and continuation ofsmoking. Intentions to smoke appear to be a particularly strong predictor of futuresmoking for those who have already tried smoking. These findings suggest a need foranti-smoking efforts to focus on preventing experimentation with smoking and ondiscouraging transitions to more regular smoking. 3.10 Research undertaken in Australia by the Open Mind Research Group on behalf of the National Drug Strategy analysed the reasons why young people take upsmoking. The study came to similar conclusions as the US studies cited above. Thestudy found that for primary school age children the primary motivation has beenidentified as 'curiosity', and the excitement of doing something 'forbidden'. Forchildren in this age group the trigger to experiment with cigarettes comes with theavailability of cigarettes and the encouragement of older friends, peers or siblings. 12 For early secondary school age children the main motivation to start smoking is associated with peer group pressure the desire to 'belong'. The study noted that even children who claimed that they disliked smoking when they were younger, hadtaken up smoking in Year 7 because they considered that this was the 'price of entry'into membership of the social group they desired. 13 3.11 The Open Mind report found that the core motivation for children in taking up smoking in the late secondary years of schooling was 'the expanding social life young people experience at this age, and the pressures this entails to feel comfortable, to look comfortable, to look and feel mature...smoking has moved fromthe 'badge of belonging' within the social network, to a 'badge of maturity', and anassertion of sexuality, and power'. 14 The study found that the sexual cues given by the act of smoking become a key focus at this age a major preoccupation in discussion about smoking centres on what boys/girls do or don't think of you if youdo/don't smoke. Stresses associated with study and with new social situations are alsolinked with initiation into smoking at these ages. 15 10 ibid., pp.133-38. 11 ibid., p.138. 12 Open Mind Research Group, National Drug Strategy: Adolescent Smoking , July 1994, p.121. The Open Mind Research report was based on group discussions and interviews with 12-to-24 year-olds, focusingon especially 12-18 year-olds at secondary school and 16-24 year-olds who had left secondary school.The report was based on the observations/conclusions of the researchers. 13 ibid., p.122 14 ibid., p.123. 15 ibid., p.124.58Incidence of juvenile smoking 3.12 Table 7 indicates in that in 1993, the smoking rate for 12- to 15-year-olds was 17.5 per cent (17 per cent of boys and 17.9 per cent of girls), while the smoking ratefor 16- to 17-year-olds was 28.8 per cent (27.9 per cent of boys and 29.5 per cent ofgirls). 16 As the table indicates, the smoking prevalence for both boys and girls in the 12- to 15-year-old age group was similar in 1993, but more girls aged 16 and 17smoked than boys in the same age group.

Hill, et al., 'Prevalence of Cigarette Smoking Among Australian Secondary School Students in 1993', Australian Journal of Public Health , Vol.19, No.5, 1995, p.5. 3.13 The data indicate that the prevalence of smoking increases with age. Table 8 shows that while 8 per cent of students aged 12 years smoked, for those aged 17 yearsthe prevalence was much higher (a rate of 30 per cent). 3.14 The table also indicates that the proportion of students who had smoked in the 12 months prior to the survey reached a peak of 52 per cent of girls aged 15 years and48 per cent of boys aged 16 years. The average number of cigarettes smoked perweek was similar for both boys and girls up to the age of 14 years. However, for boysaged 15 to 17 years, the weekly consumption of cigarettes was significantly greaterthan for girls. 16 The data on juvenile smoking are drawn from information collected from four national surveys of school children's smoking habits carried out under the auspices of the Australian Cancer Society and itsmember organisations in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993.

Amongstudents aged 16 to 17 years, the prevalence of smoking decreased or remained static.A number of factors were responsible for this trend including the effects of youtheducation/information campaigns, restrictions on advertising of tobacco products andcigarette price increases. 17 3.16 Between 1990 and 1993 the data (as shown in figures 1 and 2) indicate that the proportion of both male and female students smoking in 1993 was higher than in1990 for most age groups, (except for females aged 15-16 years where the rateremained static). Among 12- to 15-year-olds, the prevalence of smoking in 1993 wassignificantly higher than in 1990, especially for boys. The proportions of 16- to 17-year-olds smoking between 1990 and 1993 was not significantly different. 3.17 The comparison of the data on smoking rates for 1990 and 1993 suggests that the general trend towards a decline in smoking rates among young people which wasevident throughout the 1980s has ended. Slightly more 12- to 15-year-olds weresmoking in 1993 than in 1990, mainly due to an increase in smoking rates amongboys. The prevalence of smoking among 16- to 17-year-olds remained at similarlevels to those of 1990. 17 Advice from the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria, 31 October 1995.613.18 It was noted in the study that the increase in smoking rates among young people in the 1990s is due to an increase in 'occasional' smoking rather than in'committed' smoking (defined as a person smoking on three or more days of the lastweek). The study found that the proportion of 12-to 15 -year-old 'committed'smokers in 1993 was virtually the same as that in 1990, and not significantly differentfrom that in 1987. For 16- to 17-year-olds, while there was no change in theproportion of committed smokers between 1990 and 1993, the proportion ofcommitted smokers was higher in 1984 than in the three subsequent survey years. 18 3.19 The reasons for the recently observed trend showing an increase in smoking rates amongst young people in the 1990s have been explained in the following terms: Uptake of smoking can be considered to be driven by the belief that it helps project a desired image of oneself. The trend observed in youngerstudents raises the possibility that aspects of popular adolescent culturehave changed, in that smoking as a fashion statement has recentlygained greater appeal than before. It is possible that the rise in casualsmoking might be because of unfavourable behaviour or attitudes ofpowerful exemplars for youth (such as musicians), characterisation onfilm and television and reportage in magazines that are influential withyoung adolescents. 19 Patterns of tobacco use 3.20 The most popular brand of cigarette reported to be smoked by current smokers in the 1993 survey was Peter Jackson (30 per cent of boys and 33 per cent of girls). Winfield was the next most popular brand, smoked by 20 per cent of boys and 18 per cent of girls, followed by Longbeach (9 per cent of boys and 13 per cent of girls). These three brands captured over 60 per cent of the secondary school smoker market.The most popular packet size was the 25s, with 37 per cent of male and femalesmokers obtaining their most recent cigarette from packs of this size. The packs of 30were the next most popular, with 27 per cent of boys and 28 per cent of girlsreporting that they obtained cigarettes from these packs. Only 5 per cent of boys and4 per cent of girls used packs of 50 to obtain cigarettes. 20 3.21 In all age groups and for both genders, 'friends' were identified as the single most common source of cigarettes, with 34 per cent of males and 35 per cent offemale smokers indicating friends as their source of supply. 21 Overall 52 per cent of female and 48 per cent of male smokers purchased the last cigarette they had smoked.Older adolescents were more likely to have purchased their own supply of cigarettes. 18 Hill, op. cit., p.5. 19 ibid., p.4. 20 ibid. 21 Other sources of supply are brothers/sisters, other family members or the purchase of cigarettes.62Some 64 per cent of 17-year-olds bought their last cigarette, compared with 23 per cent of 12-year-olds. Where cigarettes were bought, the most common source ofsupply was from a milk bar or delicatessen (15 per cent of female and 16 per cent ofmale smokers). Some 13 per cent of current smokers indicated that in the four weeksprior to the survey, they had bought a cigarette singly. Of this 13 per cent, themajority (59 per cent) had bought the cigarette from a friend or relative, and 20 percent reported buying a single cigarette from a shop. 22 Conclusion 3.22 The Committee believes that the increasing incidence of smoking amongst adolescents, especially over recent years, is a matter of grave concern. TheCommittee considers that a concerted effort needs to be made by governments at alllevels, parents, and the broader community to address this problem. Addressing the problem of juvenile smoking 3.23 The Committee received considerable evidence during the inquiry that a comprehensive and integrated strategy is needed to address the problem of juvenilesmoking. One submission, drawing on the experience of the Western AustralianSmoking and Health Program stated that 'it is not possible to single out any onestrategy as being most likely to be effective. Rather, I would advocate that healthauthorities do everything that they can, and as much of it at the same time aspossible'. 23 A representative of the AMA noted that an 'integrated strategy' is needed combining education, price increases and other initiatives in order to reduce tobaccouse. 24 A New Zealand study also emphasised that comprehensive policies to reduce consumption are more effective than any single measure.25 The study argued that essential features of an effective government policy to reduce tobacco use combineseducational programs to inform teenagers about the dangers of tobacco use, theraising of tobacco prices, and a ban on tobacco promotion. 3.24 The Committee believes that a comprehensive approach is needed to address the problem of juvenile smoking. The elements of such an approach are discussedbelow and include issues relating to education and information, packaging of tobaccoproducts, advertising and promotion, product placement in films and television, andtaxation of tobacco products. The specific problems and strategies relating to theaccess of minors to tobacco products are discussed at paragraphs 3.101 - 3.153. 22 Hill, op. cit., p.4. 23 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.2. 24 Transcript of Evidence , p.396 (AMA). 25 NZ Toxic Substances Board, Health or Tobacco , Wellington, May 1989, p.103.63Education and information 3.25 Evidence to the Committee suggested that there was a need for a greater emphasis on education and information programs for young people to alert them tothe consequences of smoking. Several witness noted that the community generallyhas a responsibility to educate young people on the dangers of smoking and that moreresources needed to be devoted to this task. 26 3.26 The National Health Policy on Tobacco in Australia recognises that 'education on smoking and health issues is a vital part of any smoking control program.Education, as part of a comprehensive program, can produce a reduction in smokinglevels in children and adults and is also effective in preventing the onset of tobaccouse...Education should not be seen in a limited context but needs to be considered interms of both formal and informal education structures'. 27 Improving mass media education strategies 3.27 During the inquiry the Department of Human Services and Health (DHS&H) informed the Committee that its anti-tobacco advertising campaigns directed at youngpeople to date had not been effective in reducing the incidence of juvenile smoking. 28 A representative of the Department stated that the 'QUIT' program was seen as a'come-on' to young people (i.e. more of an 'invitation' to smoke, than adiscouragement). The Departmental officer further noted that the Department 'had tolook very hard at how we were going to develop some messages that were consistent with the values and beliefs of contemporary young people ...We have marginalised tobacco smoking in adult social behaviour, but we have made it a more attractivesubstance to young people. 29 3.28 Research into the issue of youth smoking by the Open Mind Research Group, on which the Department's new strategy is based, found that a successful strategy hadto challenge the positive images and notions that are currently associated withcigarette smoking within contemporary youth culture, including raising the profileand relevance of the health consequences of tobacco use, and focusing on the youngsmokers' immediate peer group. 30 3.29 The Open Mind research indicated that it is important to target 'influencers' within the peer group as an effective means of targeting young people generally.

These are the people who generate the 'trends'. These are also the peoplewho are in a position to challenge the very signals that smoking generates withincontemporary Australian youth culture'. 31 3.30 The research indicated that even non-smokers believed that smokers are 'cool'. At the same time the research found that there are 'positively perceived' non-smokers who project self-confidence in a relaxed and acceptable manner. Theseteenagers are key models for reinforcing the decision not to smoke amongst currentnon-smokers. The research concluded that the campaign should be designed to appeal to the 'youth influencers' both smokers and non-smokers in mid- to late secondary school (15-17 years) on the basis that 'successfully undermining thepositive associations with smoking that currently exist for these young people andinfluencing their attitudes will in turn influence those within the broader targetaudience of all young people aged 12-17 years'. 32 3.31 The research report found that an effective advertising campaign needed to be seen to come from within the 'youth paradigm', not from the adult world, and torecognise that smoking is currently integral to the social fabric of school life; to besensitive to young people's overall health concerns and self-esteem (that is, motivateyoung people to adopt appropriate attitudes and behaviour towards smoking, withoutdenigrating their position); and to communicate on a 'youth-to-youth' basis by usingpersons similar in age to the target audience, or persons seen to be part of theirculture. 3.32 The study found that girls are critical of any attempt to 'single them out' in anti-smoking campaigns and that such an approach may inspire them to becomefurther committed to remaining a smoker. The report also found that while school-age smokers can list health slogans, such as 'smoking causes lung cancer', they donot internalise the relevance of these messages for them as young people. 33 Commonwealth initiatives 3.33 In accordance with the National Health Policy the Commonwealth Government is implementing a Tobacco and Health Public Information Campaignwhich targets youth. The campaign involves comprehensive mass media activities;and aims to address issues related to the attitudes, incidence and prevalence ofsmoking amongst young people by undermining the positive associations whichcigarette smoking has within the contemporary Australian youth culture; encouragingyoung smokers to give up smoking; increasing the numbers of young people who arenon-smokers; and reducing the motivation to take up smoking. 31 ibid., p.6. 32 ibid., p.5. 33 ibid., p.8.653.34 In 1994, The Commonwealth committed $3.1 million to the Tobacco and Health Public Information Campaign targeting young people. The campaign isplanned to run in phases for at least three years. The campaign, which is aimed at the15-17 year age group, is designed to deglamourise and deconstruct the mythssurrounding smoking. The campaign message avoids overtly telling young peoplewhat to do; the commercials imply, rather than state, that smoking in itself is notglamorous, 'cool' or rebellious. 34 3.35 The first phase of the youth initiative, the 'Smoking is Really Interesting' campaign, is designed to challenge old attitudes to smoking while aiming to shapeand reinforce new ones. The campaign strategy is based on several phases ofadvertising, involving increasingly more complex messages. The initial phasesinvolve cinema and print media advertising with an expansion to television and othermedia as the campaign progresses. 35 Improving teacher education 3.36 Witnesses commented on the need to improve the information available to teachers and the health educators, including the provision of in-service training.36 One witness noted that, 'there are ...repeated requests from health education teachers for more support, for more training about how to teach about tobacco and otherhealth education issues. So it is not being delivered to the children and the peoplewho are charged with the responsibility feel inadequately prepared and supported tofulfil that responsibility'. 37 3.37 The Committee received some evidence on initiatives in the States in relation to teacher education. For example, in NSW the Department of Health providesfunding for the training of drug education consultants who provide information,advice and skills-training for teachers involved in drug and alcohol education inschools. 38 In Western Australia, extensive in-service training is available for teachers in the area of drug education.39 Improving education programs in schools 3.38 While the Committee received information from several States/Territories indicating their support for school-based tobacco education programs some evidenceargued that more resources should be devoted to these programs in schools providing 34 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, pp.13-14. 35 ibid., p.14. 36 Transcript of Evidence , p.140 (Professor K. ibid., pp.140-41 38 Transcript of Evidence , pp.710-11 (NSW Department of Health). 39 Transcript of Evidence , p.860 (Queensland Cancer Fund).66information to students on the risks of smoking.40 One witness noted that, 'not all children are given anti-tobacco education ...The amount of time devoted to health education has contracted [in recent years] and tobacco, along with a number ofpressing issues, has received less attention in schools'. 41 3.39 Another witness remarked on the failure of the education system to provide sufficient information to young people on smoking and its effects.42 A representative of the AMA argued that there should be a formal requirement for education in allschools in Australia about the harmful effects of tobacco use. 43 3.40 In the United States, the National Cancer Institute identified a number of features considered necessary for effective school-based smoking preventionprograms. These factors include that the program be introduced during the transitionfrom primary school to junior high school; that it be incorporated into the existingschool curriculum; that it emphasise the social factors that influence smoking onset,the consequences of smoking and refusal skills; and that the program should besocially and culturally relevant to each community. 44 It was also suggested that the delivery of classroom sessions be at least five times per year in the sixth through tothe eighth grades; that the involvement of students in the presentation and delivery ofthe program be encouraged; that parental involvement be encouraged; and that therebe adequate training of teachers involved in the program. 45 3.41 US studies have shown that school-based smoking prevention programs identifying social influences that encourage young people to begin smoking andteaching skills to resist those influences have demonstrated consistent and significantreductions in the prevalence of adolescent smoking. One study examined 90 school-based prevention programs conducted during the period 1974 to 1989 that sought todevelop skills to resist social influences. Results from the study indicated thatsmoking prevalence was on average 4.5 per cent lower among students in the socialinfluence programs than among students in control conditions. In the most successfulprograms, the smoking prevalence was reduced by about 25 per cent. 46 3.42 Most of the successful programs in the United States that provide skills for resisting social influences share several major curriculum components. Onecomponent is to convey the short-term negative consequences of smoking, including 40 See Submission No. 56, p.2 (NSW Government); Submission No. 58, p.8 (Queensland Department of Health); Submission No. 38 p.7 (ACT Government). See also Transcript of Evidence , p.140 (Professor K. Jamrozik); Transcript of Evidence , p.868 (Queensland Cancer Fund). 41 Transcript of Evidence , p.140 (Professor K. Jamrozik). 42 Transcript of Evidence , p.679 (ASH Australia). 43 Transcript of Evidence , p.387 (AMA). 44 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.219. 45 ibid. 46 ibid., p.225.67social undesirability and physiological impairment. Another component is to have students explore inaccurate normative expectations - students thus learn that smokingis not a 'usual' behaviour for adolescents their age and that the majority of persons inany age group are non-smokers. An additional component is to engage students intraining, modeling and reinforcing methods that counter the influences that leadadolescents to smoke, and to coach students to communicate these techniques toothers. Some approaches also include personal and social skills training to promoteoverall competence and reduce the motivations to smoke. 47 3.43 The effectiveness of school-based smoking prevention programs appears to be enhanced and sustained by comprehensive school health education programs and bycommunity-wide programs that involve parents, mass media, communityorganisations. In the United States, the positive effects of school-based smokingprevention programs tend to dissipate over time and need to be supplemented byother programs as noted above. One US study noted that 'programs grounded inschool-based skills training are indeed important for preventing smoking, althoughmore sustained and comprehensive efforts may be needed for long term success'. 48 Conclusions 3.44 The Committee believes that there should be a greater emphasis on anti- smoking education programs in schools, including policies promoting a smoke-freeenvironment in schools. The Committee considers that effective national educationprograms need to be developed for primary and secondary students and that teachereducation programs need to be improved. Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS: 14. That national education programs be developed for primary and secondary school students and that these programs be regularly revised; and that theseprograms be based on the most recent research and evidence of the socio-economic, environmental, behavioural and personal factors identified asencouraging the take-up of tobacco use by young people, and the continuing useof tobacco by young people. The Committee further recommends that theseprograms include information on the dangers of passive smoking, particularlyfor young people. 47 ibid., pp.218-19. 48 ibid., p.226.6815. That primary and secondary teachers, who will teach or are teaching health courses that include anti-smoking units, be funded by the CommonwealthGovernment as part of the National Drug Strategy to attend teacher educationand in-service training sessions. 16. That school-based smoking prevention programs be encouraged and expanded; and that they be taught each year from at least Year 4 (about 9 years of age) tothe end of secondary schooling. 17. That no smoking be permitted (including smoking by students, staff, parents and visitors) on any school premises; and that students who are found in breachof this be counselled, and supported through drug education and 'Quit' smokingprograms. Generic packaging 3.45 A number of contributors to the inquiry, including the AMA, Centre for Adolescent Health and the NSW Cancer Council, argued that cigarette manufacturersshould be required to sell their products in neutral or generic packaging. 49 Generic packaging involves the use of simple, plain (black and white) packs containing thebrand name, details of contents, a health warning together with the tar and nicotinecontent and the name of the manufacturer. 50 3.46 Proponents of generic packaging argue that the current system of 'brand imaging' associated with the design and style of the packs increases the attractivenessof cigarettes for juveniles. One submission noted that brand imaging 'has created avery strong association between the appearance of the packaging and the imageportrayed in advertising. This has created what could be called a \"store in value\" inthe package design. The package design is, in itself, a form of advertising.' 51 A witness representing the Centre for Adolescent Health emphasised that the 'image onthe pack' is one of the things that young people are buying, 'if you take away thatassociation and make them look unattractive the likelihood of them initiatingsmoking would be significantly less. You decrease the general social acceptability ofthe product'. 52 3.47 Another submission noted that the design of packs is a key component in the tobacco industry's effort to market its products to consumers and that each company 49 Transcript of Evidence , p.385 (AMA); Transcript of Evidence Health); Submission No.53, pp.9-10 (NSW Cancer Council). 50 Transcript of Evidence , p.103 (Centre for Adolescent Health). 51 ibid., p.102. 52 ibid., p.123.69'will strive to develop and market pack designs that maximise the attractiveness of the pack to each brand's target markets'.53 3.48 Contributors to the inquiry cited several studies that showed that children find dull, bland 'generic' packs of cigarettes to be the least attractive and desirable whenpresented with a range of different packs. 54 The Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer conducted research, asking children which type of packs they would be mostcomfortable with and would prefer to be seen with amongst their friends. Theresearch showed that children like to be seen with the more glamorous looking packsrather than the plainer packs. 55 One witness cited a University of Otago study that showed that cigarettes were significantly less attractive to young people when boxedin plain generic packs. 56 3.49 One submission from a tobacco company argued, however, that plain packaging may have the opposite effect to that intended by advocates of the proposal.It was argued that putting cigarettes in plain packaging may in fact enhance theirappeal to juveniles by reinforcing the perception of smoking as an act of rebellion. 57 DHS&H also advised the Committee that Canadian research into generic packagingand research conducted by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer inAustralia recognised that, while the intent of generic packaging is to replace positivebrand imagery with negative brand imagery, such packaging could in fact have theopposite effect. 58 3.50 It was also put to the Committee that generic packaging would increase the efficacy of health warnings. One submission noted that neutral packaging would allow government health warnings to be more visible 'there would be significantly less 'clutter' and less scope for the tobacco industry to disguise the health message bypackage design and colour schemes'. 59 One tobacco company, disputing these arguments, stated that there was no lack of awareness in Australia of the claimedhealth risks associated with smoking nor was there evidence to suggest thatincreasing the visibility of health warnings through plain packaging will influencesmoking behaviour. 60 3.51 Another major reason advanced by the proponents of generic packaging is that the introduction of plain packaging would lead to a reduction in tobacco 53 Submission No.53, p.9 (NSW Cancer Council). 54 ibid. 55 Transcript of Evidence , p.272 (NSW Cancer Council). 56 Transcript of Evidence , p.123 (Centre for Adolescent Health). 57 Supplementary Submission No.45, p.5 (W.D. & H.O. Wills).58 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.14.59 Transcript of Evidence , p.104 (Centre for Adolescent Health). 60 Supplementary Submission No.45, p.7 (W.D. & H.O. Wills).70consumption.61 This argument is essentially an extension of the other arguments relating to the reduction of the 'glamorous' effect of branded packaging andincreasing the prominence of the health warnings on packs and the effect that bothwould have on consumption. 3.52 Proponents of generic packaging did not provide conclusive evidence that the introduction would lead to a decrease in tobacco consumption amongst young people,and the industry disputed the claim that consumption is determined by the packdesign. One submission noted that the relevance of branding and packaging is that itis a means by which smokers can make a choice between different tobaccoproducts. 62 3.53 The industry pointed out to the Committee that the proposal to require cigarettes to be sold in generic packaging would be a threat to the commercial valueof brands to manufacturers. It was stated that brands are a valuable commercial assetowned by tobacco manufacturers because of the consumer goodwill and brand loyaltyattached to them. Brands are also the means by which the manufacturers differentiatetheir products and compete for market share. One tobacco company stated that'generic packaging would be tantamount to a confiscation of these valuable assetsviolating the legal and constitutional rights of the manufacturers who own them'. 63 It was also argued by one tobacco company that as the proposal would 'wipe out' thevalue of the Company's key commercial assets it would have 'little choice but topursue a substantial claim for compensation'. 64 Conclusions 3.54 The Committee received a range of often conflicting evidence on the efficacy of generic packaging. While some evidence suggested that generic packaging wouldreduce the attractiveness of cigarettes for children, other evidence raised some doubtsconcerning the effectiveness of this approach. The Committee believes that moreresearch needs to be undertaken into the role generic packaging could play in anintegrated strategy addressing the problem of adolescent smoking. The Committeeconsiders that, on the basis of the evidence received, there is not sufficient evidenceto recommend that tobacco products be sold in generic packaging. 61 For a discussion of this issue see ibid., p.7. 62 Committee RECOMMENDS: 18. That additional research be undertaken into the efficacy of generic packaging of tobacco products as a means of addressing the problem of juvenile smoking. Point-of-sale advertising 3.55 Some evidence to the Committee, including submissions from the National Heart Foundation, AMA, ACOSH, and the Centre for Adolescent Health suggestedthat point-of-sale advertising by tobacco companies should be prohibited. 65 3.56 As noted in Chapter 2, the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 has now extended the prohibition of tobacco advertising to almost all forms of direct andindirect advertising and promotion, including sponsorship. Advertising is limited tothe right of tobacco companies to place point-of-sale advertising material in retailoutlets. 3.57 Point-of-sale material is regulated at both the Commonwealth and State levels. Since 1 October 1993, the Commonwealth has required that point-of-sale materialshould be within the boundaries of shops, should only be visible from display pointswithin those shops and if placed on windows should face inwards. 3.58 In addition to these minimum requirements imposed by the Commonwealth, a number of States have imposed other restrictions. For example, in New South Walesand Western Australia there are detailed rules governing the location, size, visibility,format and the use of health warnings in relation to this form of advertising. 66 In New South Wales, the area of a tobacco advertisement is limited to 2 000 squarecentimetres per retail outlet. The maximum width of a tobacco advertisement must benot be less than half and not more than three and a half times the maximum height ofthe advertisement. In addition, twenty-five per cent of the area of each tobaccoadvertisement must display one of the four prescribed health warnings, such as'Smoking Causes Lung Cancer'. 67 It has been argued that New South Wales has the most stringent restrictions on point-of-sale advertising in Australia.68 Western Australia also has tight controls on this form of advertising, with regulations limiting 65 Submission No.3, p.3 (National Heart Foundation); Transcript of Evidence , Transcript of Evidence for 66 Supplementary Submission No.45, p.1 (W.D. & H.O. Wills).67 Letter from NSW Drug and Alcohol Directorate to the Committee, dated 23 November 1995, pp.4-7.68 Health Department of Western Australia, Submission to the Review of the Tobacco Control Act 1990 , December 1994, p.13.72the size and position of point-of-sale advertising and a requirement to display a health warning which is 25 per cent of the area of the advertisement.69 3.59 The tobacco companies argued that point-of-sale advertising should continue as it offered a means by which manufacturers could provide information toconsumers about both existing products and new product lines. Such advertising alsoenabled companies to compete with each other for brand and market share amongstexisting smokers. 70 3.60 Proponents of a ban on this form of advertising noted that several major medical and consumer groups eg. WHO, World Health Assembly, the InternationalUnion Against Cancer and the International Organisation of Consumers' Unions haveidentified a ban on all forms of tobacco advertising as an essential component of acomprehensive smoking control program. 71 3.61 It was also argued that it is inconsistent for the Government to have progressively prohibited most forms of advertising while permitting a continuation ofpoint-of-sale advertising. It has also been claimed that allowing the continuedpromotion of tobacco products in this form undermines the credibility of governmenthealth education campaigns against smoking. 72 3.62 Evidence to the Committee suggested that as children are often in close proximity to convenience stores, milk bars and corner shops where they oftenpurchase cigarettes, they are in direct contact with point-of-sale advertising and canbe influenced by the presence of such advertising material. One study, commentingon the influence of point-of-sale advertising, noted that for a 'brand loyal smoker',the reminder value of a point of sale display is low, 'therefore, to the extent that thesedisplays focus on brand image, they may...encourage new smokers to experimentwith a particular brand (and with its associated brand image)'. The study concludedthat point-of-sale advertising is 'potentially directed at new, youthful smokers'. 73 DHS&H advised the Committee that point-of-sale advertising 'clearly provides adirect association between tobacco products and the images and symbolismassociated with smoking in general and specific brands of tobacco'. 74 3.63 One submission noted that elimination of tobacco promotion has been associated with a decline in tobacco consumption, especially among young people,for example, in New Zealand, Norway and Canada. 75 A study that analysed the 69 ibid. 70 Supplementary Submission No. 45, p.2 (W.D. & H. O. Wills). 71 Transcript of Evidence , p.101 (Centre for Adolescent Health). 72 ibid., p.102. See also Submission No.53, p.11 (NSW Cancer Council). 73 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.186. 74 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.15.75 Transcript of Evidence , p.102 (Centre for Adolescent Health).73relationship between tobacco advertising and tobacco consumption in 33 countries found that when the countries were grouped according to the degree of governmentrestriction of tobacco promotion, the greater the degree of restriction, the greater theaverage annual decline in tobacco consumption by young people. The study foundthat those countries with total advertising bans (over the period 1970-86) havewitnessed a decline in the proportion of youth who smoked by an average 2.7 per centper year, as against an average decline of 1.6 per cent per year in countries whichpermitted tobacco advertising in most media. 76 3.64 However, the relationship between advertising restrictions and decreases in teenage tobacco consumption was disputed by the tobacco companies. One companynoted that in Australia, notwithstanding the imposition of advertising restrictions, therate of juvenile smoking has increased. 77 The submission also noted that in several countries, such as Finland and Sweden, juvenile smoking had increased following theimposition of advertising bans. 78 3.65 In the United States, over US$300 million was spent by the tobacco companies on point-of-sale advertising in 1990 (this figure represented only 10 per cent less thanUS$328 million spent on cigarette advertising in magazines that year). 79 It was also claimed that the tobacco companies in Australia have been investing large sums ofmoney in point-of-sale advertising. 80 It was stated that the companies were 'testing the margins' of the various State and Territory provisions as to what is and is notpermissible under the legislation. 81 Another submission noted that the tobacco companies operating in Western Australia and New South Wales have been designingnew display cases and dispensing units to maintain as large a presence as possible inretail outlets in those states. 82 Conclusions 3.66 The Committee notes that most forms of direct and indirect advertising have been prohibited in Australia with advertising now largely limited to advertising atpoint-of-sale. The Committee considers that, on the basis of the evidence received,point-of-sale tobacco advertising should be subject to comprehensive restrictions. 76 The study noted that some of the decrease in teenage smoking in countries that ban advertising may also be due to health promotion policies, or to price policies in those countries. See NZ Toxic SubstancesBoard, op. cit., pp.64-65. (W.D. & H.O. Wills).78 ibid. See also Supplementary Submission No. 44, section 5 (Philip Morris). 79 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.186. 80 Submission No. 53, p.11 (NSW Cancer Submission No.29, p.14 (ACOSH).74Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 19. That comprehensive restrictions on the size, placement and format of point-of- sale advertising of tobacco products, similar to those applying in New SouthWales, be applied in all States and Territories. Other promotional activities 3.67 Some concern was raised during the inquiry by several groups, including the NSW Cancer Council and ASH Australia, at certain promotional activities conductedby tobacco companies, especially the use of 'premiums' or 'premium items'. 83 This involves giveaways of such items as key rings, cigarette lighters, pens or calendarswith the purchase of cigarettes. 3.68 The groups concerned with these practices argue that the tobacco companies target children through these promotions. One witness provided an example of 'thecricket calendar that has two packets of Benson and Hedges stuck on the front: it pictures Shane Warne, who is every child's hero. I believe that that free gift which after all you can purchase anywhere, for just two packs of cigarettes is an inducement to children to smoke'. 84 Other examples were given of promotions that would appeal to young females, such as free diaries and the invitation to send awayfor Dolly- type magazines. 85 3.69 The Committee also received evidence relating to the promotional activities by companies in certain Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory.86 A promotion by Philip Morris involved purchasers receiving a T-shirt (in someinstances with the name of the local Aboriginal community) with the purchase of twopacks of Marlboro cigarettes. One submission commenting on such promotion argued that it was an 'unscrupulous targeting of a community group known to havehigh levels of tobacco consumption and thus little motivation and knowledge on thehealth effects of tobacco products to challenge the practise'. 87 It was also noted that such promotions may undermine the health education activities amongst suchcommunities. 88 Philip Morris responded to these concerns by arguing that the Northern Territory promotion was similar to other promotions throughout the country 83 Transcript of Evidence , p.273 (NSW Cancer Council); Transcript of Evidence , pp.664-5 (ASH Australia). 84 Transcript of Evidence , p.665 (ASH Australia). 85 ibid. 86 Submission No.39, p.8 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services); Submission No.20, p.5 (Northern Territory Tobacco Interest Group). 87 Submission No.39, p.8 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services).88 ibid.75and that in the instances where the name of the Aboriginal community was identified on the T-shirt the agreement of the local Aboriginal community was obtained.89 3.70 The tobacco companies claim that these types of promotions are not directed to adolescents. One company stated that the items sold with cigarettes 'are carefullychosen to ensure they appeal to persons 18 years of age and above'. The companyexplained the rationale for the use of premium items in the following terms '[it is] amarketing tool designed to reinforce our consumers' brand loyalty, and to attract smokers of opposition products ...it is a method of rewarding our current smokers for choosing to smoke our brand and to illustrate to smokers of competitor products therewards they can receive if they switch to our brand'. 90 3.71 Evidence to the Committee suggests that the use of premiums is, at least to some extent, directed at the youth market. Material provided to the Committee byPhilip Morris on its marketing activities associated with premiums showed that itemssuch as lighters, caps, T-shirts and videos are provided with the sale of the brands of Peter Jackson and Longbeach. While the Company claims that their target market associated with these brands is 'adults' smoking their competitors brand cigarettesand/or blue collar smokers, surveys suggest that Peter Jackson is the brand most commonly reported to be smoked by teenage smokers (30 per cent of boys and 33 percent of girls). Longbeach was the third most popular brand (smoked by 9 per cent of boys and 13 per cent of girls). 91 The Committee believes that items such as T-shirts, caps and lighters would have appeal to young people. 3.72 A recent United States report into youth smoking has also raised concerns about this type of promotional activity. The report stated that 'the distribution of freesamples is one of the most powerful devices available to marketers. It allows acompany to put its product into the hands of possible consumers in circumstances where consumers are more likely to try it (e.g, outside of work or school) ...Although the cigarette manufacturers argue that samples are not intended for nonusers orminors, there is little evidence of distribution control'. 92 The importance of this form of marketing is reflected in the growth in expenditure on this form of promotion. Inthe United States, expenditure on the distribution of speciality or premium itemsincreased from US$10 million in 1975 to over US$300 million in 1990. 93 89 Supplementary Submission No.44, section 8, p.2 (Philip Morris). For a further discussion of tobacco use amongst Aboriginals see Chapter 4. 90 Supplementary Submission No.44, section 8, p.1 (Philip Morris).91 Letter from Philip Morris to the Committee, dated 13 April 1995, pp.7-8. See Hill, op. cit. , p.4. 92 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit. , p.186. 93 ibid.76Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 20. That the distribution of non tobacco-related products associated with the sale of tobacco products be prohibited. Product placement in films and television 3.73 Evidence to the Committee raised the issue of product placement in films and television and the effect that such practices may have on influencing young people tosmoke. 94 Several witnesses noted that tobacco companies, especially in the United States, spend a large proportion of their promotional expenditures on productplacement in television and films. 95 One witness stated that a tobacco company in the United States paid US$500 000 to have Marlboro cigarettes featured in the film Superman: the Movie a film directed at the children's market.96 3.74 Another witness noted that it was 'essential that the insidious practice of product placement in movies and TV production is abolished or at least curtailed ...by constant repetition, the use of cigarettes is likely, possibly in a subliminal way, to be accepted as the norm particularly by those young enough to be more easily influenced, or possibly by lower socio-economic groups lacking objectiveinformation'. 97 3.75 Several options were suggested to the Committee to address the issue of product placement in Australia. Some evidence to the Committee argued that thereneeds to be greater enforcement of the current laws regarding product placement infilms and television. One witness stated that: If there is any evidence that money has changed hands from the tobacco industry or its various associated companies to people in films,television programs, plays or whatever, to have products depicted in thescenes, then that is a form of tobacco advertising and is contrary to theAct. 98 3.76 DHS&H advised the Committee that in the 1995-96 Budget, funds were made available under the Health Australia program to enable comprehensive monitoring of 94 Transcript of Evidence , p.636 (Non-Smokers Movement of Australia); p.851 (Queensland See Submission No.53, pp.12-13 (NSW Cancer Council).96 Transcript of Evidence , p.851 Cancer Fund). 97 Transcript of Evidence , p.636 (Non-Smokers Movement of Australia). 98 Transcript of Evidence , p.274 (NSW Cancer Council).77compliance with the Act.99 It was suggested that DHS&H undertake a random audit of recently produced films and television programs to determine whether money fromtobacco companies has been used, directly or indirectly, to promote smoking and/ortobacco products and that prosecutions be initiated if breaches of the law haveoccurred. 100 A representative of the Department noted, however, that securing sufficient evidence to initiate prosecutions regarding product placement in films andtelevision would be difficult. The official stated 'we would dearly love to haveevidence that someone is being paid so that we could do something about that. But itis not going to be something that will be easily provided'. 101 3.77 The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 provides for the prosecution of any manufacturer who provides financial inducements to include product placementrelating to tobacco products in mediums such as television or film. 102 DHS&H advised that the Commonwealth has not initiated any prosecutions of this nature todate. 103 One submission noted that a central consideration 'must be whether or not the appearance of smoking in films has been commissioned' as commissioned productplacement is a form of tobacco advertising and as such is in breach of the Act. 104 Imported films with tobacco product placement and magazines imported intoAustralia that contain tobacco advertising are exempt from the Act. 3.78 Several witnesses noted that there are problems related to artistic freedom and censorship in moves to restrict product placement in films and television. DHS&Hnoted in its submission that the rationale for the current legislation was to 'avoidinfringing freedom of creative expression; to ensure that the Australian film industryis able to compete on an equal footing in an international market; to ensure film, andcreative material is unabridged, that is, not subject to censorship of tobacco issues;and to ensure community access to international films [and] television'. 105 3.79 Anti-smoking groups also acknowledged problems related to this issue. For instance, the Queensland Cancer Fund noted that 'there is a problem in drawing theline between freedom of artistic expression on the one hand and utilisation of thesemedia for exploitation of smoking among children on the other. We do not have apanacea for that problem'. 106 3.80 Other problems relating to the increasing reach of information technology, such as satellite television, information available on the Internet etc. and the impact 99 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.15. 100 Submission No.53, p.14 (NSW 102 ibid. 103 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.15. 104 No.53, p.13 (NSW , p.858 (Queensland Cancer Fund).78that this will have on the promotion of tobacco products, especially to young children, was also raised during the inquiry. One witness conceded that it will be'extremely difficult' to limit the impact of international advertising and informationgenerally on young people who will be exposed to in the future. However, there was a need for Governments to take action to address the problem 'it may be impractical. It may be impossible to stop all of it ... [but] we need, in this country, to start to take a lead in getting other countries to recognise that this is even aproblem'. 107 3.81 It was suggested that Australia should take the lead in encouraging tobacco control charters, international treaties and the like through such institutions as theUnited Nations. One witness noted that there is now in place an internationalagreement that all airlines will become smoke-free. 108 One submission argued that tobacco advertising on satellite television could be controlled by amending theBroadcasting Television Act to prohibit tobacco advertising in programs beamedeither into Australia or produced in Australia and beamed to other countries.Alternatively, it was argued that separate legislation could be introduced to controltobacco advertising appearing on satellite broadcasted programs. 109 3.82 Several witnesses suggested that Commonwealth grants to the film industry should only be made under certain conditions related to how such films portrayedsmoking and tobacco products generally. One witness suggested that if smoking wasportrayed in such films it should be portrayed in a 'realistic' manner. 110 Another witness commented that the 'image' of cigarette smoking in films is beingincreasingly portrayed as being 'acceptable behaviour'. The witness cited the case of Muriel's Wedding , a film supported by Commonwealth funding through the Australian Film Board. 111 3.83 Other witnesses suggested that greater efforts should be made to raise awareness within the film and television industry of the requirements under the Act inrelation to product placement and issues generally relating to the promotion oftobacco products through these mediums, however indirectly. 112 One witness stated that some actors who were required to smoke in films had expressed to him feelingsabout 'how uncomfortable they felt about it and the moral dilemma about artisticfreedom versus the example that they are setting and so forth'. 113 107 Transcript of Evidence , p.402 (AMA). 108 Transcript of Evidence , p.151 (Professor K. Jamrozik). 109 Submission No.51, p.6 (Health Department of Western Australia).110 Transcript of Evidence , p.859 (Queensland Cancer Fund). 111 Transcript of Evidence , p.123 (Centre for Adolescent Health). 112 Transcript of Evidence , p.89 (Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria); Submission No.53, pp.13-14 113 Transcript of Evidence , p.276 (NSW Cancer Council).793.84 The Committee believes that there needs to be more debate in the community on this issue and that the film and television industry needs to be made more aware ofconcerns expressed by many within the industry and the community generally. Onesubmission raised the possibility of introducing a film classification system based onwhether films portrayed smoking in a positive light or not, similar to the way inwhich films depicting illicit drug use are now rated M or R. 114 Conclusions 3.85 The Committee considers that the current legislation providing for the prosecution of manufacturers who provide financial inducements relating to tobaccoproducts should be vigorously enforced. The Committee also believes that increasedefforts should be undertaken by the Department of Human Services and Health,especially through the provision of information to the industry, to raise the awarenessof the film and television industry of the requirements under the Act regardingproduct placement and issues relating to the promotion of tobacco products throughfilm and television. The Committee understands that the Department has initiatedcontact with the relevant industry bodies to ensure compliance with the legislation. 115 3.86 The Committee recognises that there are issues relating to artistic freedom and censorship in any moves to restrict product placement in films and television andconsiders that education of the industry and enforcement of the current legislationshould be a major priority to ensure a responsible approach. Taxation 3.87 Several contributors to the inquiry, including the AMA, Australian Cancer Society, National Heart Foundation and ACOSH argued that increases in the level oftaxation on tobacco products were needed to discourage young people fromsmoking. 116 A representative of the AMA stated 'we feel that taxation is an important and responsible mechanism for governments to use in reducing the use of tobacco'.117 3.88 Several groups also argued that the Commonwealth and State and Territory Governments should ensure that there are regular real increases in tobacco taxes. Forexample, the Australian Cancer Society argued that the Commonwealth Governmentshould increase the excise duty on cigarettes by 5 per cent per annum above the CPI-indexed increases that now apply, thus increasing the price of tobacco products in 114 Submission No.53, p.13 (NSW Cancer Council). 115 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.15.116 Transcript of Evidence , p.398 Evidence , p.398 (AMA).80real terms; and that State and Territory Governments should increase the rate of their tobacco franchise fees.118 3.89 Tobacco is taxed at the Federal level in the form of excise duties on the weight of tobacco and at the State and Territory level in the form of business franchise feeson wholesale sales. 119 3.90 Evidence to the Committee suggested that teenagers will reduce their consumption of cigarettes in response to price increases in tobacco products. A representative of the AMA stated that 'it is generally accepted and much of the work on this comes from the United States that a ten per cent increase in the price generally results in a four per cent reduction in consumption across the board, and ina fourteen per cent reduction in uptake by children, who are most sensitive to priceincreases'. 120 Other evidence, cited by the Queensland Cancer Fund, showed that in Canada, where the real price of cigarettes increased by 158 per cent from 1979 to1991, teenage tobacco use by 15- to 19-year-olds fell by two thirds over the sameperiod. 121 A representative of the Queensland Cancer Fund, commenting on these figures, noted that while pricing policy 'is a blunt instrument...it is also singularlyeffective. If governments are serious about dropping teenage smoking rates, as theCanadians are, then taxation policy is very, very effective'. 122 3.91 Studies that have examined the relationship between taxation increases and the demand for tobacco products by teenagers have generally found that teenagers are avery price-sensitive group and particularly more sensitive to price changes thanadults. One study reported that adolescents aged 12 to 17 years would reduce theircigarette consumption proportionately to any increase in cigarette price. 123 The Industry Commission report, summarising a number of studies noted that 'there is 118 Submission No.40, p.7 (Australian Cancer Society). 119 The current rate of Commonwealth excise is $79.02 per kilogram of tobacco. Since February 1984, the excise rate has been indexed to movements in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on a six monthly basis.However, since 1988 the rate of excise has increased at a faster rate than the CPI. In the 1995-96 Budgetthe Commonwealth Government announced a 10 per cent increase in the rate of tobacco excise. Thisincrease comprised the bringing forward from 1 August 1995 of a 5 per cent discretionary increase announced in the 1993-94 Budget and an additional 5 per cent increase included in the May 1995Budget. As noted above, all States and Territory Governments levy taxes on the sale of tobaccoproducts in the form of business franchise fees. The tax is levied as a percentage of the wholesale valueof tobacco products. The rate currently applying in all States and Territories is 100 per cent of the valueof sales (except Queensland, where the rate is 75 per cent of the value of sales).

Viscusi, Smoking: Making the Risky Decision , Oxford University Press, New York, 1992.81some evidence from these studies to suggest that price has a greater effect on the teenage population than on older people, by influencing the decision to smoke'.124 3.92 A US Surgeon-General's report into adolescent smoking concluded that 'the large amount of empirical literature on the relationship between cigarette prices andcigarette smoking suggests that increased excise taxes on cigarettes reduce overall cigarette smoking ...The price responsiveness of adolescents is at least as high, if not significantly higher, than that of adults a finding that suggests that an increase in cigarette taxes would result in large reductions in smoking prevalence and cigaretteconsumption among teenagers'. 125 3.93 Evidence also suggests that increasing taxation levels is effective in reducing teenage and aggregate smoking levels in the future. One study noted that 'it is quitepossible that the cohort of young smokers who never began to smoke as a result ofthe tax increase would never become regular smokers. As a consequence, over aperiod of several decades, aggregate smoking and its associated detrimental healtheffects would decline substantially'. 126 Another study also states that 'an excise tax increase, if maintained in real terms, might continue to discourage smokingparticipation by successive generations of teenagers and young adults and graduallyimpact on the smoking levels of older age groups as the smoking-discouraged cohortsmove through the age spectrum'. 127 3.94 Available data suggest that there is some scope for taxation increases as the tax incidence on cigarettes in Australia is relatively low when compared with someoverseas countries. 124 Industry Commission, op. cit., Appendix O, p.6. 125 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.272. 126 E.

Denmark imposes the highesttaxes on cigarettes, with Australia ranking in the middle range of countries in relationto the taxation of cigarettes. 128 Consumer Price Index 3.96 Evidence received from several contributors, including Professor Nossal, the Australian Cancer Society and the National Heart Foundation argued that tobaccoshould be removed from the basket of goods used in the calculation of the ConsumerPrice Index (CPI). 129 Other evidence, however, did not support this proposal. One submission noted that tobacco products form a significant proportion of householdexpenditure and are an important item of consumption for a large proportion of 128 See also Transcript of Evidence , pp.665-68 (ASH Australia). 129 Submission No.63, p.1 No.42, p.5 (National Heart Foundation).83Australian households therefore their exclusion from the CPI would distort the index.130 3.97 It was also noted that the index, if it is to accurately measure changes in the prices of goods and services, needs to reflect the actual purchasing patterns ofAustralian households. One submission stated that 'any adjustment of the CPI, eitherto the respective weights of the existing basket or to the goods and services in thebasket, should continue to be based on an objective assessment of the currentexpenditure patterns of Australians'. 131 3.98 The composition of the CPI is based on the 'average' pattern of household expenditure. Expenditure items (eg. tobacco products) are given a 'weighting' ormeasure of their relative importance as expenditure items. The fact that tobacco isused by less than one-third of the population is taken into account in the calculationof the weighting given to this item. From time to time the CPI basket of goods andservices is revised to ensure that it continues to reflect the actual spending patterns of the population. 132 The current 'weighting' given to cigarettes and tobacco (of 2.4 per cent) in the calculation of the CPI is significant, and exceeds the weighting given toseveral other individual items, including fuel and light charges and holiday travelcosts. 133 3.99 Evidence arguing for the removal of tobacco products from the CPI suggested that its removal would be appropriate given that it is a product currently used by lessthan a third of the adult population. 134 One study has noted the shift in tobacco use 'towards being a minority discretional expenditure'.135 3.100 Professor Nossal also argued that such a move would provide an incentive for governments to raise excise, unlike the current arrangements where an increase in theretail price of cigarettes is reflected in the CPI and, consequently, in the inflation rate.By removing tobacco products from the calculation of the CPI, the impact of any taxincreases on these products would not be reflected in the CPI nor in the inflation rate.A representative of the AMA, supporting the change, noted that it would send asignal to smokers by facilitating price increases for tobacco products. 136 130 For example, some 38 % of semi- and unskilled workers, and 28% of skilled tradesmen smoke.

That the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments ensure that there are regular real increases in levels of excise duties and business franchise feeslevied on tobacco products; and that the revenue from these taxation increasesbe directed to tobacco control and health promotion activities. 22. That tobacco products be removed from the basket of goods used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. Restricting the sale of tobacco products to minors 3.101 Reducing the availability of tobacco products to minors is important for a number of reasons. Making cigarettes more difficult to obtain makes it less likely thatyoung people will experiment with smoking at an early age and less likely that theywill become regular smokers. Restricting access to tobacco products may also deterthose young people unwilling to break laws to obtain tobacco and will add to theperceived social unacceptability of tobacco use. Controlling the sale of tobaccoproducts to minors also emphasises the dangerous nature of tobacco products. Thesecontrol measures also reinforce the messages about the potentially harmful nature oftobacco that young people receive in school and other settings. 3.102 During the inquiry the Committee received evidence that minors are able to obtain cigarettes relatively easily from a wide variety of sources and that presentarrangements for addressing the problem of the purchase of tobacco products byminors is inadequate in most jurisdictions across the country. 137 A number of measures were proposed during the inquiry to address the issue of the sale to minors.These issues, which are discussed below, include the requirement for a minimum agefor the purchase of tobacco products, restricting the number of retail outlets,improving retailer education, addressing the problem of vending machines andimproving enforcement and compliance. Minimum legal age for the purchase of tobacco products 3.103 The minimum legal age for the purchase of tobacco products is 18 years in all States and Territories, except in Queensland and Tasmania where the minimum legalage is 16 years. The Committee was advised that in Queensland, legislation toincrease the minimum legal age from 16 years to 18 years is planned to be introduced 137 Submission No.53, p.14 (NSW Cancer Council).85in 1996.138 In Tasmania there are currently no plans to raise the age from 16 to 18 years.139 3.104 The Committee believes that a standard minimum age of 18 years for the purchase of tobacco products should be introduced in all States and Territories. TheCommittee considers that it would be desirable to introduce uniformity across allStates and Territories, especially as the age of 18 years has been adopted in mostjurisdictions. It would also introduce consistency with the minimum age for thepurchase of alcohol, which is 18 years. In the United States, all 50 States and theDistrict of Columbia have adopted a minimum age of 18 years for the sale of tobaccoproducts. 140 3.105 The Committee also believes that it is important to take action to discourage children and adolescents from smoking until they are more mature and capable ofmaking informed and rational decisions as adults. The Committee notes that thetobacco industry has also advocated establishing a uniform minimum age of 18 yearsfor the purchase of tobacco products by juveniles across all States and Territories. 141 3.106 The Committee also believes that the State and Territories should investigate the feasibility of making it an offence for persons under the age of 18 years topurchase tobacco products. The Committee considers that in order to encouragecompliance with the law there is a need to have some penalty in place in order todeter children and adolescents from attempting to purchase tobacco products. Theintroduction of such a measure would encourage individual responsibility by childrenand adolescents and remove the onus on proprietors from accepting full responsibilityfor the sale of tobacco products to minors, as is the case at present. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 23. That the minimum age for the purchase of tobacco products be 18 years in all States and Territories; and that the States and Territories investigate thefeasibility of making it an offence for persons under the age of 18 years topurchase tobacco products. 138 Advice from the Queensland Department of Health, 24 October 1995. 139 Advice from the Tasmanian Department of Community and Health Services, 24 October 1995.140 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.249. 141 Submission No.45, p.16 (W.D. & H.O. (Tobacco Institute of Australia).86Proof-of-age 3.107 During the inquiry it was argued that one means of discouraging sales to minors would be to require some form of proof-of-age for young people purchasingtobacco products. The proposal to require proof-of-age recognises that it is oftendifficult for retailers and their staff to accurately determine the age of youngercustomers. Wills proposed that the ID card system currently used for purchases ofalcohol should be extended on a national basis for the purchase of tobaccoproducts. 142 The Committee was advised that this proposal is being considered by the NSW Government.143 3.108 The Working Group of State Attorneys General in the United States has recommended that proof-of-age, in the form of a reliable form of photographicidentification such as driver's licence, State-issued identification card or passport, berequired before cigarettes are sold to persons who appear to be 25 years oryounger. 144 3.109 The Committee believes that a suitable form of identification, such as a driver's licence, 18+ card etc., should be required to be produced by adolescentspurchasing tobacco products. The Committee recognises that problems may arisewhere younger staff, especially those under the age of 18 encounter minors, (who insome cases may be friends or peers), seeking to purchase cigarettes. However, theCommittee believes this problem can be overcome by younger staff being instructedby store supervisors to request proof-of-age from those customers who appear under18 years of age, or to refer these customers to the supervisor. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 24. That an appropriate form of proof-of-age identification be automatically required for young people purchasing cigarettes. Restricting the number of retail outlets 3.110 Some evidence to the Committee suggested that the availability of cigarettes to juveniles could be reduced if the numbers of retail outlets selling tobacco productswere reduced. Currently tobacco products are sold in a variety of outlets includingtobacconists, supermarkets, milk bars, service stations, newsagents and convenience 142 Submission No.45, pp.16, 20 (W.D. & H.O. Wills). 143 Transcript of Evidence , p.538 (W.D. & H.O. Wills). 144 The Working Group proposed that proof-of-age be required for persons aged 25 years or yo unger because of the difficulty retailers face in accurately determining the age of customers. See WorkingGroup of State Attorneys General, No Sale: Youth, Tobacco and Responsible Retailing , December 1994, p.32.87stores. Several submissions proposed that the sale of tobacco products should be restricted to licensed premises and to tobacconists.145 One submission also suggested that there be a moratorium on the granting of any further tobacco licences.146 3.111 Retail organisations were opposed to restrictions on the type or number of outlets permitted to sell tobacco products.147 The Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations noted that such restrictions would deprive many retailoutlets of a significant source of their income. The Federation stated that 'in somecases the loss of the right to sell these products would be catastrophic. In others, itwould mean loss of income and possible reductions in staff numbers'. 148 3.112 Another submission provided data on the importance of tobacco sales to many businesses. For tobacconists, tobacco sales constitute 85 per cent of total dollar turnover. Corresponding percentages for other types of retail outlets are service stations (40 per cent), convenience stores (30.5 per cent), milk bars (25 per cent), andgrocery stores, including supermarkets (8 per cent). 149 3.113 Some evidence from the retail sector suggested that reducing the number of retail outlets may not lead to a reduction in juvenile tobacco consumption. Onesubmission noted that under-age smokers will still be able to obtain cigarettesthrough older friends, siblings and often parents who are prepared to purchase ontheir behalf. 150 The submission also noted that juvenile alcohol use is still a major problem yet all alcohol is sold through licensed outlets.151 The Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations noted that there has already been a substantial reduction in the number of outlets selling tobacco products from around 60 000 in 1965 to 40 000 in 1995.152 3.114 Those advocating restrictions on the number of tobacco outlets argue that the present arrangements for the 'anywhere, anytime, by anybody' tobacco sales policy is'antithetical to government policy on reducing smoking in the community'. 153 145 Submission No.41, p.9 Australia). 146 Submission No.53, p.16 (NSW Cancer Council).147 See Submission No. 66, p.1 (Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations); Submission No. 68, p.4 (WA Tobacco Retailers' Association); Submission No. 67 (Convenience StoresAustralasia); Submission No. 70 (Newsagents Association of NSW and ACT). 148 Submission No.66, p.1 (Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations).149 Supplementary Submission No.44, section 11, p.1 (Philip Morris).150 Submission No.66, p.1 (Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations).151 The Committee notes, however, that reducing the number of outlets may reduce juvenile alcohol abuse.152 The Association noted that this decline is due to a reduction in the number of corner stores with the advent of regional shopping centres, reduction in the number of service stations and increasing volumethrough major chains. See Submission No. 66, p.1 (Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco TradeAssociations) p.1. 153 Submission No.53, p.16 (NSW Cancer Council).88Another submission noted that it is not surprising that recruitment of children as smokers is increasing when 'tobacco products are as ubiquitous as milk and bread'.154 3.115 The Committee believes that the widespread availability of tobacco products through the vast number of retail outlets has provided a relatively easy way forminors to obtain cigarettes. One study has shown that the most common outlets forself reported illegal purchase of cigarettes by minors in NSW were small generalstores (31 per cent), petrol stations (23 per cent), milk bars (18 per cent), andsupermarket chains (14 per cent). 155 This is confirmed by overseas evidence. In the United States, small stores and petrol stations are the major source of cigarettes forunderage buyers. 156 3.116 The Committee believes that minors will be discouraged from purchasing cigarettes if the number of retail outlets is reduced. As a preliminary measure, theCommittee believes that tobacco products should be isolated from other products inretail outlets selling tobacco products. In the longer term, the Committee considersthat retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products should be restricted to licensedpremises and to tobacconists. To minimise disruption to small business, theCommittee believes that this latter proposal should be phased in over time. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 25. That there be a reduction in the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products and that: as an interim measure, tobacco products be isolated from other products for sale in all outlets currently selling tobacco products; and in the longer term, those retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products be restricted to licensed premises and to tobacconists; and that this bephased in to minimise any disruption to small business. Operation of the licensing system 3.117 Some groups, including the AMA and the Non-Smokers Movement of Australia argued that licensing arrangements for the sale of tobacco products couldbe improved. 157 All States and Territories, except Queensland, require tobacco 154 Submission No.41, p.9 (ASH Australia). 155 R. Sanson-Fisher et al., 'Availability of Cigarettes to Minors', Australian Journal of Public Health , vol. 16, No. 4, 1992, p.356. 156 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.248. 157 Transcript of Evidence , p.389 (AMA); Transcript of Evidence , p.648 (Non-Smokers Movement of Australia).89retailers to be licensed to sell tobacco products; in Queensland wholesalers are required to be licensed.158 It has been argued that introducing a licensing system creates a 'negative social environment' for tobacco, whereby cigarettes areconsidered to be a controlled substance rather than a commodity. In addition, thethreat of losing a licence would encourage supervisors to inform employees of theirresponsibilities and insist on compliance with the law. 159 One witness noted that 'you have to register the tobacconists, and you have to make sure that, if they lose theirlicence, they cannot sell, so that they have a strong financial disincentive to losingtheir licence'. 160 3.118 The operation of licensing systems in the States and Territories, however, has shown that they have not been fully effective. It has been found that monitoring oflicence holders in several States has been difficult due to the number and type ofretail outlets. 161 It was noted in the case of Queensland that the option of introducing a tobacco retail licence was not favoured unless the number and type of retail outletswere substantially reduced. 162 3.119 The problems of operating a licensing system is illustrated in the case of the ACT. While a licensing system operates in the ACT there is no restriction on the typeof outlet that can apply for a licence and the system has largely operated as a revenue-raising function. A representative of the ACT Government stated that 'the licensingsystem is mainly there to collect franchise fees so that we keep track of who is sellingtobacco in the ACT. Historically, providing a licence for tobacco retailers has notbeen done from a health context; it is just registering a business that wants to selltobacco products. There has been no concept of restricting outlets from a healthperspective'. 163 3.120 The Committee notes that some problems associated with the operation of licensing systems outlined above, especially monitoring retail outlets for compliance,could be overcome by restricting the number of retail outlets permitted to sellcigarettes (this issue has been addressed in the previous section). 3.121 It has been noted that a flaw in many States' current laws is that they do not clearly impose any sanction on the stores that sell tobacco products to minors. Only inNew South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are tobacco licences used for penalty 158 Advice from the Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations, 27 October 1995. 159 For a discussion of these issues see additional information from the Queensland Department of Health to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.31. 160 Transcript of Evidence , p.648 (Non-Smokers Movement of Australia). 161 Additional information from the Queensland Department of Health to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.31. 162 ibid. 163 Transcript of Evidence , p.313 (ACT Government).90reasons (i.e. licence suspension).164 In the United States, only 14 States provide for the revocation of a licence as a penalty for non-compliance with laws regardingtobacco sales to minors. The Committee believes that the States' and Territories'legislation should ensure compliance with legislation relating to the sale of cigarettesto minors through suspension or revoking of licences. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 26. That the licensing systems in all States and Territories provide for the suspension or revocation of a licence where retail outlets sell tobacco productsto minors. Retailer education 3.122 Research indicates that educating retailers about the law reduces illegal sales of tobacco sales to children and adolescents.165 A number of States have introduced measures specifically directed at retailers. In New South Wales, information isprovided to retailers by environmental health officers to ensure their compliance withthe Act. 166 3.123 In Western Australia , the retailer education component of that State's efforts to reduce sales to minors aims to raise retailer awareness of their responsibilitiesunder the law and to provide practical advice and resources to minimise thelikelihood of tobacco being sold to a minor. Retailer education is also seen as anessential precursor to enforcement, demonstrating to retailers and the community thata co-operative approach to obtain compliance has been tried before resort to othermeasures. 3.124 In Western Australia, the Health Department periodically sends all retailers explanatory letters, pamphlets addressing common queries received from retailers,material detailing practical tips for minimising the chance of selling tobacco to under-age persons, and in-store signage. In 1993 store signage was redesigned to include astatement that proof-of-age may be required for tobacco purchases, and a cashregister/counter sticker that prompted the sales person was produced. Advertisementsabout the illegality of selling tobacco to children have also been placed in retailmagazines and trade journals. 167 The maximum penalties for the sale of tobacco 164 Additional information from the Queensland Department of Health to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.5. 165 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.9. 166 Transcript of Evidence , pp.706-7 (NSW Department of Health). 167 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, pp.9, 49.91products to minors in Western Australia are $5000 for an individual and $20 000 for a body corporate for a first offence and $10 000 for an individual and $40 000 for abody corporate for a second and subsequent offence. 168 3.125 When the Health Department receives a complaint about a particular store, a letter is sent to the store informing them that a complaint has been received, andreminding them of their legal responsibilities and the penalties involved. TheDepartment noted that these warning letters have 'proved a strong motivator forretailers to reconsider their practices regarding selling tobacco to children. Retailerswho have not previously thought about not selling tobacco to children, now thinktwice, and many more are reminding staff about their policies on demanding proof-of-age for all young people'. 169 3.126 The Department has also instituted a system of rewarding responsible retailers who conscientiously refuse to sell cigarettes to young people. Retailers receive a'responsible retailer' sticker and the Department generates positive publicity for thestore for not supplying cigarettes to children. The Department encourages schools,parents and regional Health Department personnel to identify local retailers who areeligible for this award. 170 3.127 The Department also noted that retailers learn by example and that 'their motivation not to sell tobacco to children is reinforced every time they hear throughthe retailer grapevine or media that another retailer has been prosecuted and fined forselling tobacco to a child'. 171 3.128 Surveys commissioned by the Western Australian Health Department indicate that between 1992 and 1994 the proportion of retailers prepared to sell cigarettes toyoung people had dropped significantly from 89 per cent to 28 per cent over that period a decline of 61 per cent. 172 The Department noted that the significant change in retailers' attitudes and practices to the sale of cigarettes to minors was due to theDepartment's comprehensive approach of education, enforcement, publicity andpositive reinforcement of responsible retailers. 3.129 The Committee believes that more emphasis needs to be placed in the important area of retailer education. The Federation of Australian Retail TobaccoTraders Associations stated in its submission to the Committee that, with the possibleexceptions of Western Australia and New South Wales, throughout Australia there is 168 Health Department of Western Australia, Submission to the Review of the Tobacco Control Act 1990, p.48. 169 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.49. 170 ibid., p.50. 171 ibid., p.49. 172 ibid., p.50.92a distinct apathy in government toward education of retailers.173 Another submission noted that retail education programs should be more widely promoted, that retailersshould be advised of their responsibilities and be provided with relevant informationkits and that a system of warnings and appropriate penalties should be introducedwhere retailers have knowingly supplied cigarettes to minors. 174 Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 27. That State and Territory Governments, in co-operation with the appropriate retail trade associations, expand their education programs directed at retailers. Access to vending machines 3.130 Regulations on the placement of vending machines varies throughout Australia. Vending machines are restricted to licensed premises in South Australiaand the ACT and to licensed premises and staff amenity areas in New South Wales,Victoria and Western Australia. In Tasmania they are restricted to areas supervisedby an adult. In Queensland, vending machines owned or operated by tobaccocompanies are restricted to areas which are licensed, staff amenity areas, or areassupervised by an adult. The location of independently owned and operated machinesin Queensland is not restricted. In the Northern Territory there is no restriction onwhere vending machines may be located. 175 3.131 While the location of vending machines is restricted to areas in which children and adolescents are not permitted without adult supervision in all States andTerritories except the Northern Territory, they still provide a relatively easy source ofaccess for cigarettes for young children and adolescents. Overseas studies show thatwhereas children and adolescents may be successful in attempting to purchasecigarettes some of the time in over-the-counter sales, they are successful inpurchasing cigarettes from vending machines on most occasions. Studies in Australiaconfirm these findings. A survey in South Australia found that 12- to 14-year-oldswere successful in buying cigarettes on every attempted occasion irrespective ofwhere the vending machines were located. A recent survey in Queensland alsoshowed that adolescents were able to purchase cigarettes from vending machines in97 per cent of attempted purchases. 176 173 Submission No.66, p.2 (Federation of Australian Retail Tobacco Trade Associations). 174 Submission No.67, p.6 (Convenience Stores Australasia). See also recommendation number 25 proposing a reduction in the number of retail outlets. 175 Additional information from the Queensland Department of Health, 23 March 1995, p.13.176 ibid., pp.13-14.933.132 A number of options are available for dealing with the issue of access to vending machines by children. These options include the use of some form of lockingdevice or token system which requires the purchase of a token from an adult in orderto use the machines; restrictions on access to adult only areas; and the banning ofvending machines entirely. 3.133 In relation to the first option, an evaluation of the long-term effectiveness of locking devices in the United States found them to be generally ineffective. Thesecond option, that of restricting vending machines to adult areas only, has also beenineffective. As noted above, a survey in South Australia found that children weresuccessful in buying cigarettes on every attempted occasion, irrespective of whethervending machines were situated in 'adults only' areas. 177 3.134 A study in New South Wales found that adolescents perceived that vending machines were the easiest of all sources for obtaining cigarettes . Vending machines were rated as 'very easy' or 'fairly easy' to purchase cigarettes from by 50 per cent ofunder-age youth. However, the most common sources for self-reported illegalpurchase of cigarettes were small general stores (31 per cent) and petrol stations(23 per cent). Vending machines were a source for 11 per cent of illegal purchases. 178 3.135 A review of studies in the United States that evaluated the effectiveness of restrictions on the sale of cigarettes through vending machines found that in someinstances educational campaigns coupled with licensing and fines resulted inreductions in sales, while in others this approach had no effect. The study concludedthat 'results were more significant...when vending machines were entirely banned'. 179 3.136 Proponents of a total ban on vending machines argue that this needs to be considered as there appears to be no effective means of restricting vending machine sales interventions which have successfully reduced over-the-counter sales appear to be ineffective in reducing vending machine sales and fines do not appear to beacting as deterrents. 180 In the United States, 21 States have adopted laws restricting tobacco vending machine sales.181 Some nine US States have banned the sale of cigarettes from vending machines and at least thirty US cities have totally bannedcigarette vending machines. 182 In addition, President Clinton has proposed a 177 See ibid., p.14. 178 Sanson-Fisher, op. cit. , p.356. 179 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.249. 180 See additional information from Queensland Department of Health to the Committee, dated 23 March 1995, p.15. 181 US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., p.41. 182 C. Bartecchi et al., 'The Global Tobacco Epidemic', Scientific American , May 1995, p.30; US Department of Health and Human Services, op. cit., pp.249-50.94comprehensive ban on vending machines as part of a package of measures to address the problem of youth smoking.183 3.137 The Committee recognises that the introduction of a ban on vending machines may lead to a reduction in revenue for many establishments, may causeinconvenience for adult customers who wish to purchase cigarettes and may be seenas a general response to a 'specific' problem of juvenile access to tobacco products.However, the Committee believes that this needs to be balanced against the fact thateliminating this important source of cigarettes for minors will play an important rolein addressing the problem of access to cigarettes for minors. 3.138 The Committee believes that, on the basis of evidence in Australia and overseas, attempts to limit the access of minors to vending machines has not beeneffective. As cigarettes become more difficult to obtain in over-the-countersituations, it is likely that vending machines will become more attractive to childrenand adolescents attempting to purchase cigarettes. The Committee therefore believesthat the sale of cigarettes through the use of vending machines needs to be prohibited. Recommendation The Committee RECOMMENDS: 28. That, as it is virtually impossible to prevent access by children to cigarette vending machines, these types of vending machines be prohibited in all Statesand Territories. Enforcement and compliance 3.139 Evidence to the Committee suggested that there is a need for improved enforcement of laws relating to restricting access of cigarettes to minors.184 One witness noted that 'there is not enough compliance monitoring in any of the States inAustralia'. 185 Laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to children can be effective in restricting the supply of tobacco to young people only if they are actively enforced. 3.140 Evidence suggests that greater emphasis should be placed on the effective monitoring of sales to minors. One submission argued that the current situation withcompliance checks was 'piecemeal'. 186 Currently, all States and Territories operate 183 The other reforms include prohibiting brand name sponsorship of sporting events, limiting tobacco advertisements in magazines with a large teenage readership, requiring proof-of-age for the purchase ofcigarettes, and measures to require manufacturers, distributors and retailers to be responsible forunderage sales.

Complaints are directed to therelevant Health Departments in all States and Territories except Tasmania wherecomplaints are directed to the police. In the Northern Territory complaints may bedirected to the police or to the Health Department. Evidence suggests, however, thatthe programs may not be effective in monitoring illegal sales. In Queensland it wasreported that the program has had limited success with few complaints being madeagainst retailers despite evidence of considerable under-age smoking. It was notedthat members of the public were probably not sufficiently aware that the law relied onthem to report breaches. 187 The Committee believes that the States and Territories should do more to inform the public of the appropriate bodies to which they candirect complaints. 3.141 Some evidence suggested that compliance checks using children are the most effective means of monitoring sales. In the United Kingdom, a number of LocalAuthorities have used children, usually aged between 10 and 13, to make testpurchases of cigarettes from retail outlets. Over the period from March 1992 to July1993, some 43 of the 110 Local Authorities carrying out enforcement programsagainst illegal tobacco sales made a total of 1 841 test purchases with the help ofunder-age young people; as a result 38 Local Authorities brought criminalproceedings and 36 of these Authorities gained successful prosecutions in this way.Of the other 59 Authorities, only two had successfully prosecuted retailers withoutusing young people in the monitoring operation. 188 In the United States, the Working Group of State Attorneys General proposed that compliance checks using teenagetesters, acting under adult supervision, should be encouraged. 189 3.142 The problems associated with the operation of the laws in most States and Territories and lack of enforcement of laws in relation to minors was highlightedduring the inquiry. In the case of NSW, only seven convictions have been madeagainst retailers illegally selling cigarettes to minors and most convictions haveresulted in low fines of approximately $100. 190 3.143 In Queensland, there have been no prosecutions recorded. A representative of the Department of Health noted that 'the current legislation is very old and it does nothave powers associated with it; it was written in 1905 and it has not been amended. Itmakes it difficult for people to enforce the legislation if they do not have generalpowers of enforcement: powers to seek information...and powers to take people tocourt. Current advice would suggest that it is not possible to enforce'. 191 187 Additional information from the Queensland Department of Health, dated 23 March 1995, p.18. 188 UK Health Education Authority, Not for Sale: Stopping Smoking Before it Starts , n.d., p.5. 189 Working Group of State Attorneys General , op. cit. , p.40. 190 Transcript of Evidence , p.713 (NSW Department of Health). 191 Transcript of Evidence , p.815 (Queensland Department of Health).963.144 In the ACT two cases have been referred to the courts and one resulted in a successful prosecution. A representative of the ACT Government noted that 'as thelegislation stands at the moment, it is very difficult to bring a successful case throughthe courts unless you observe a demonstrably young person purchasing tobacco froma person who has obviously not taken any notice at all about their age'. 192 3.145 In Western Australia twenty-four retailers have been prosecuted for the sale of tobacco products to minors and several other cases are pending.193 In that State there have been more prosecutions of retailers for the sale of cigarettes to minors than allthe other States combined. 3.146 As noted above, the State and Territory Governments do not appear to be enforcing the laws relating to the sale of cigarettes to minors, if the level ofprosecutions is any indication. One witness stated that 'unfortunately, there is verylittle enforcement of [the] law in New South Wales and in other States and that iswhy I believe a significant number of retailers are quite prepared to sell illegally tochildren because they know that the law is not going to be enforced'. 194 One submission noted that the lack of resources both human and financial to dedicate to the enforcement of these laws has been a major obstacle to their effectiveimplementation. 195 3.147 Penalties for the sale of tobacco products to minors varies between the States and Territories. Fines imposed on proprietors for a first offence range from $200 inthe case of Tasmania to $10 000 in the Northern Territory. Most other States imposefines of between $1 000 and $5 000. For second and subsequent offences the finesgenerally range from $1 000, as in the case of the ACT, to $10 000 in the case ofNew South Wales, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. 196 3.148 Western Australia is one State that has made significant progress in the enforcement of laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco to minors.197 The Health Department now has two employees dedicated to education regarding, andenforcement of, the relevant Act. Enforcement has been strengthened with thesupport of State police officers responsible for monitoring under-age alcohol sales.Retailers selling tobacco to children are identified through police or HealthDepartment officers incidentally witnessing the sales taking place, and through 192 Transcript of Evidence , p.312 (ACT Government). 193 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia, dated 23 March 1995, p.10.194 Transcript of Evidence , p.674 (ASH Australia). 195 Submission No.51, p.6 (Health Department of Western Australia).196 Additional information from the Queensland Department of Health, dated 23 March 1995, p.42; Tobacco Institute of Australia, Tobacco Industry Fact Sheet , 11 October 1995. 197 Additional information from the Health Department of Western Australia, dated 23 March 1995, pp.10- 11, 48-49.97investigation resulting from public complaints about individual retailers selling tobacco to minors. 3.149 All cases are forwarded to Public Prosecutors for representation in court. The Department has fostered a positive relationship with legal counsel assigned totobacco cases, providing them with briefings on the issue of the sale to minors.Counsel now make sentencing submissions stressing the need to prevent youngpeople smoking by restricting their supply and advocating a penalty designed to deterother retailers from selling tobacco to children. As a consequence, fines haveincreased from $50 in 1992 to $1500 in 1994. 3.150 The Health Department has established a practice of responding to every reported incident of cigarettes being sold to a minor. If insufficient evidence exists toproceed to court, retailers are sent letters informing them of the complaint andwarning them that they will be prosecuted if they continue to sell tobacco to children.The Department noted that, as a result, more retailers now contact the Department forassistance in the form of signage and advice generally. 3.151 The Department has also encouraged media coverage of prosecutions by cultivating media contacts, issuing media releases, and targeting and localising storiesfor relevant newspapers. As a result, virtually every prosecution has received eitherState, regional or local press coverage. This media coverage has also had the effect ofincreasing retailers' perceptions of the likelihood of getting caught if they selltobacco to children. 3.152 As noted above, a novel approach to compliance has been to reward retailers who conscientiously refuse to sell to minors. Retailers, identified as 'responsible' areawarded a sticker to display in their store. The Department uses this strategy togenerate positive publicity and increase public awareness that a growing number ofretailers are refusing to sell cigarettes to minors. A measure of the success of thisstrategy is that prior to the passage of the Tobacco Control Act in 1990 there were no recorded prosecutions, whereas there have been 24 prosecutions to date since the Actwas passed. Conclusions 3.153 The Committee believes that all States and Territories need to have in place a concerted and active enforcement campaign to complement laws prohibiting the saleof cigarettes to minors. The policies adopted in Western Australia have demonstratedthat an active campaign of enforcement can have a marked effect on retailercompliance with the law and is an effective means of reducing young people's accessto cigarettes. The Committee supports the Western Australian initiatives andencourages other States and Territories to introduce similar programs. 198 198 See also recommendation number 25 proposing a reduction in the number of retail outlets selling tobacco products.98Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS : 29. That State, Territory and Local Governments increase the level of funding and personnel devoted to the enforcement of laws restricting the supply of tobaccoproducts to minors; and that increased resources be devoted to the prosecutionof retailers that contravene such laws. 30. That State and Territory Governments institute routine systems of random compliance checks to monitor the sale of tobacco products to minors. 31. That the Commonwealth Government encourage the States and Territories to improve the effectiveness of their enforcement and monitoring programs; andthat: as part of their monitoring system the States and Territories provide statistics annually to the Commonwealth on the number of complaints andprosecutions against retailers selling cigarettes to minors; and the States and Territories run a publicity campaign that informs the public of the appropriate bodies to which they can direct complaints regarding thesale of tobacco products to minors. 32. That a system of substantial fines be introduced in all States and Territories to discourage the sale of tobacco products to minors.99CHAPTER 4 TOBACCO USE AMONGST CERTAIN SOCIO-ECONOMIC, OCCUPATIONAL AND OTHER GROUPS 4.1 This chapter considers issues relating to tobacco use which have a particular impact on specific groups within the community. Amongst these are lower-incomegroups; certain occupational groups where the incidence of tobacco smoking isconsidered to be higher than the general community; people of Aboriginal and TorresStrait Islander (ATSI) background; and people of non-English speaking backgrounds. Lower-income groups 4.2 There are a number of underlying social and economic factors which contribute to socio-economic disadvantage. Among these are low income, relativelylow educational attainment levels and high unemployment. By comparison withpeople in higher socio-economic groups, people from lower socio-economic groupshave a higher prevalence of poor health and make greater use of doctors, hospitalsand outpatient clinics, but make less use of preventive and screening services. 1 Those people with socio-economic disadvantage have a higher prevalence of health riskfactors, compared to those with socio-economic advantage. These factors include ahigher prevalence of smoking, risk from alcohol, greater likelihood of beingoverweight and being inactive. The prevalence of smoking, in adults aged between25 and 64 years, has been shown to be 43 per cent higher in men and 53 per centhigher in women. 2 4.3 Low levels of education are also associated not only with poor health generally, but with higher use of tobacco which contributes to this situation.Compared with the more highly educated, data show that men (25-64 years) whohave received low levels of education (defined as having left school before 15 yearsof age, with no further qualifications) are 85 per cent more likely to smoke, with therate for women in this category being 67 per cent. 3 Men and women outside the workforce were also more likely to smoke.4 4.4 A clear relationship has been shown to exist between lower occupational status and increasing prevalence of smoking in both men and women.5 Research has shown 1 National Health Strategy, Enough to Make You Sick , Research Paper No. 1, September 1992, pp.12- 13. 2 ibid., p.29. 3 ibid., p.31. 4 ibid., p.33. 5 D. Hill, V. White and N. Gray, 'Australian Patterns of Tobacco Smoking in 1989', Medical Journal of Australia, Vol.154, June 1991, p.799.100that twice as many male 'lower blue-collar' workers are current smokers compared with 'upper white-collar' workers. On examination of the 'past' and 'never-smoked'categories, the difference was considered to be due mostly to the upper occupationalgroups (both men and women) never having taken up smoking, rather than havingrelatively greater success in quitting. 6 4.5 Although there may not be a direct relationship with socio-economic factors, family composition and marital status also impact on smoking prevalence. Forinstance, the smoking prevalence for women who head single parent families is132 per cent higher compared with married women of the same age with dependants.However, for men heading single parent families their smoking prevalence was only47 per cent higher than their married counterparts. 7 Women living alone were reported to be 74 per cent more likely to smoke than men in this category (22 percent). 8 4.6 The results of a study conducted in the United Kingdom suggest that increases in the real cost of cigarettes would help reduce differences between socio-economicgroups in the prevalence of smoking and smoking-related diseases, although specialsupport may be needed by families with the greatest economic need. 9 The study assessed the effects of price, income, and health publicity on cigarette smoking byage, sex, and socio-economic group, and concluded that men and women in lowersocio-economic groups are more responsive than those in higher socio-economicgroups to changes in the price of cigarettes and less to health publicity. 10 4.7 Analysis of the research suggests that the main effects of increasing the real price of cigarettes (for example, by tax increase) would be to reduce the prevalenceof smoking in men and women in lower socio-economic groups and to reducecigarette consumption by all men and women aged between 25 and 59. 11 It was also suggested that the reasons for high levels of smoking by economically and sociallydisadvantaged people, most of whom started smoking in their early teens, also needto be addressed, and measures taken to reduce economic hardship and socialisolation, especially that experienced by those bringing up children alone. 12 4.8 However, another UK study argued that low income families in Britain do not give up smoking in response to price rises. The only of effect price rises is to increase 6 ibid. 7 National Health Strategy Research Paper No.1, op. cit., p.34. 8 ibid., p.33. 9 J. Townsend, P. Roderick and J. Cooper, 'Cigarette Smoking by Socioeconomic Group, Sex, and Age: Effects of Price, Income, and Health Publicity', British Medical Journal , Vol.309, 8 October ibid., p.923. 11 ibid., p.926. 12 ibid.101the hardship experienced by low income smokers and their children.13 The intention of the study was to determine the extent to which the greater economic hardshipexperienced by smokers was caused by their smoking or by their lower socio-economic status compared with non-smokers. 14 The study found that the disadvantages that apparently increase the chances of smoking also, of themselves,increase the chances of hardship. To quite a striking extent, smoking increasedhardship independently of marital status, low income, manual work, lack ofeducation, claiming social security benefits, and other factors. It was found that,independent of other factors, smoking was associated with higher levels of financialand material hardship among low income families at each level of income and in eachposition of relative advantage and disadvantage. 'The greater the extent ofdisadvantage, and the lower the income, the harsher was the impact of tobaccoexpenditure on hardship. This impact fell equally on adults and children.' 15 The United Kingdom researchers concluded that if the purpose of tobacco taxation is tostop smoking by those who really cannot afford to smoke, this was not having therequired result, and other policies were needed to address the issue. 16 4.9 By contrast, an evaluation of the Family Allowance Supplement (FAS) program by the Australian Department of Social Security into the impact ofadditional payments on low-income working families found that the FAS was usedprimarily to pay for children's basic necessities such as clothing, food and schoolexpenses. 17 The availability of this allowance may have released other income for the purchase of cigarettes but the special funding itself does not appear to have beenabused. While this measure may not reduce smoking directly, it may provide someincome stability which reduces general economic and other pressures. 4.10 Cigarette pack size is also impacting on the prevalence of smoking, particularly in the lower socio-economic group. Hill and White report that the trendin the cigarette market towards large-pack (heavily discounted) cigarettes hascontinued unabated. A much higher proportion of both male and female smokers arepurchasing their cigarettes in packs of 40 or more. 18 The researchers also found this trend to be strongest among smokers of both sexes from the lower occupational andeducational levels. With marketing strategies aimed at this strata of society in whichprevalence of smoking is already high it becomes more difficult to further reduce theincidence of smoking in this group. 19 It was suggested that if the method of taxing 13 A.

Hill and V. White, 'Australian Adult Smoking Prevalence in 1992' , Australian Journal of Public Health , Vol.19, No.3, 1995, p.308. 19 ibid.102tobacco was based on the number of cigarettes per pack, rather than tobacco weight, then the discounting of cigarettes in larger pack sizes could be reduced. Furthermore,the researchers indicated that this change in taxation policy may stop the trend ofpeople from socially-disadvantaged groups buying the larger packs of cigarettes; if ahigher price were charged they believed this could help reduce smoking amongst thissocio-economic group. 20 4.11 In an attempt to address the problem of tobacco use amongst lower income groups, the DHS&H advised the Committee that the National Drug Strategic Plan hasprioritised certain population groups, such as lower socio-economic groups, to betargeted in drug prevention and treatment activities. 21 The Department also noted that the Tobacco and Health Community Education Grants Program has been developedto further the aims of the Health Australia initiative at the community level. While the scope of the Grants Program as a whole is broad, specific projects funded underthe Program will aim to meet the needs within each community. These projects mayinclude objectives such as raising the awareness of tobacco and health issues amonggroups whose needs are not currently being met by mainstream education campaigns.The Grants program is also designed to enable community-based research to beconducted into specific communities or target groups which will provide theCommonwealth with a greater understanding of their smoking prevalence, attitudesto tobacco use, and education needs. 22 Conclusions 4.12 The evidence indicates that smoking prevalence increases for people on low incomes, those in blue-collar occupations, and the unemployed. Although programshave been successful in reducing smoking overall, it would appear that this impacthas been greater on the more educated, middle-class sector of society which has thelowest smoking rates, rather than on other groups in the community. Although someevidence suggests that an increase in tax on cigarettes may have some impact, itwould appear that structural changes in areas such as education and training are alsoneeded to improve the overall situation for people in this category. As well, becausesmoking habits of people who are disadvantaged are often established at a very earlyage, health promotion programs should attempt to change this pattern and alsoencourage better attitudes towards health. 20 ibid. 21 The other priority groups are ATSI and people from NESB backgrounds. See letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.16. 22 ibid., p.17.103Recommendations 33. That strategies continue to be developed to address the special needs of 'at risk' groups in the community, such as lower socio-economic groups, to reduce theincidence of smoking in those groups. 34. That funding continue to be allocated by the Commonwealth Government for the development of appropriate programs and strategies to address the problemof tobacco use for 'at risk' groups in the community. Occupational groups 4.13 Little research has been undertaken into patterns of smoking in people in particular occupations, but there are indications that some stressful jobs result inhigher percentages of smokers in some occupational groups. Nursing has beenreported as being a stressful occupation, and, although nurses could be expected to beaware of the health risks involved in smoking, some evidence suggests that thisknowledge has little effect. However, even within this particular occupation smokingrates varied according to the levels of stress experienced in different types of nursing.For instance, data show that, of a group of student nurses who nursed children, 44 percent smoked cigarettes, as opposed to 33 per cent of those who nursed older patients.In a different student group (home economics) a much lower rate were smoking(15 per cent). 23 The Committee believes that further research should be conducted into the linkages between occupation and smoking, and that strategies should beimplemented to reduce the incidence of smoking in high-risk occupations. People of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) Origin Background 4.14 At the 1991 Census, 1.6 per cent of the Australian population identified as being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) origin. Of this population,49.5 per cent were male and 50.5 per cent were female. 24 4.15 People of ATSI background are considered to have the poorest health of all Australians, with Aboriginal women's health being of particular concern.25 Although the causes of their ill health are complex involving historical, cultural, social, economic, and structural factors the diseases which account for most Aboriginal deaths include heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke, injury and poisoningand respiratory disease. Tobacco use is one of the contributory factors in Aboriginal 23. H.

The survey found that maleswere more likely to smoke (54 per cent) than females (46 per cent). 27 4.17 Although the majority of Aboriginal people (67 per cent) live in urban areas there has been a lack of comprehensive information available on the use of tobaccoand other drugs by Aboriginal people in urban areas. 28 Given the concerns expressed by the Working Party of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy29 and the current lack of information, a cross-section survey conducted by Perkins et al. examined the self-reported use of tobacco (as well as other licit and illicit drugs) in an urbanAboriginal population. Fifty per cent of the Aboriginal people in the study weresmokers and, of these, 50 per cent were male and 49 per cent were female. Thisfinding is similar to that reported recently for Aboriginal people in country townswhere 64 per cent reported they were smokers. 30 When compared to a non-Aboriginal sample a significantly greater proportion of males and females from the study samplewere smokers. 31 Perkins suggests that the anti-smoking messages which have been developed for the wider Australian community are not having an impact on smokinglevels among Aboriginal people. 32 Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory 4.18 A large percentage (56 per cent) of Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory smoked cigarettes or tobacco according to a survey conducted in 1986. Itwas found that more men (71 per cent) than women (43 per cent) were smokers. 26. B. Bartlett and D.

Forexample, one-third of the population smoked tobacco in Queensland and New SouthWales. 35 4.19 Geographical location was a significant factor in the prevalence of smoking in the different age groups and in males and females. In the different age groups, 62 percent to 86 per cent of people living in the Top End of the Territory smoked tobacco,whereas 24 per cent to 48 per cent of people living in the Katherine/Centre regionsreported smoking. An alarming factor is that the higher percentage (48 per cent) inthe Katherine/Centre regions was from the 15 to 20 year age group. Location also hada striking affect on the prevalence of smoking in women. Of the women who smoked,73 per cent were from the Top End, and 35 per cent from the Katherine region, whichcompared with the significantly lower figure of 9 per cent from the Centre. 36 This lower figure is possibly because more Aboriginal people living in this region preferto chew tobacco (which is discussed further in this chapter). 4.20 Regional differences in the prevalence of smoking could also be related to historical circumstances. 37 Smoking tobacco was introduced to Aboriginal people in Arnhem Land, possibly several hundred years ago. It has since played an importantrole in social and ceremonial occasions and so the practice of sharing tobacco andindividual cigarettes is still widespread. As a result of these practices, and theaddictive properties of tobacco (see also Chapter 1), a high proportion of Aboriginalsin the Top End are smokers. 38 33 C. Watson, J. Fleming and K.

This was an important part of the social ritual of Aborigines in Central Australia, particularly for old men of thetribes, whereas in Arnhem Land smoking tobacco was introduced by Indonesian fishermen possiblyseveral hundred years ago. Since this time tobacco has played an important role in social andceremonial occasions. 38 Watson, op. cit., pp.69-70.1064.21 In the Top End/Katherine regions, both men and women reported that they smoked because they enjoyed the taste and the feeling that tobacco gives. Men alsoreported that smoking relieved their boredom. Of the non-smokers, men and womenstated that the reasons they did not smoke was because it was bad for their health orthey did not like the taste of tobacco. In this region, women expressed concern thatsmoking caused problems in their community, whereas most men did notacknowledge that tobacco was a community problem. However, those problemswhich were referred to were mostly health-related. 39 4.22 The Committee is pleased to note that Aboriginal peoples in Northern Australia have expressed an awareness that smoking is dangerous to health,especially in view of the fact that it has only been in the last few years that this sectorof the community has been exposed to anti-smoking messages. 40 However, the Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services in evidence to theCommittee stated that a major area of concern was that there had not been sufficienteducational programs to make ATSI people more aware of the dangers of smoking tohealth. 41 (See also Paragraph 3.69 which discusses the targeting of Aboriginal communities by tobacco companies.) Chewed tobacco 4.23 Traditionally, Aboriginal people living in Central Australia chewed the nicotine-containing plant Duboisia hopwoodii or pituri , and in the Katherine and Centre regions another type of nicotine-containing plant Nicotania known as 'bush tobacco' was chewed.42 4.24 A study has shown that, of the people interviewed, one-quarter of these chewed tobacco 38 per cent of whom were women. Chewing tobacco was more prevalent in the older age groups, with almost half of the people being older than60 years of age. 43 Although more Aboriginal people living in the Centre (41 per cent) than the Top End/Katherine regions chewed tobacco, a much higher percentage of women in the Centre and across all age groups (61 per cent) chewed tobacco, compared to 5 per cent of women in the Top End region. Chewing tobacco was alsomore prevalent in older males living in the Centre. 44 4.25 It is not clear why chewing is more prevalent among women and older men. Traditionally, it was the older men who chewed pituri.45 However, the increase in 39 ibid., p.70. 40. ABS, 1989-90 National Health Survey (1993) in Unwin, op. cit., p.5. 41 Transcript of Evidence, p.899 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services). 42 Submission No.39, p.2 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services).43 Watson, op. cit., p.72. 44 ibid., pp.72-3. 45 ibid, p.73.107women chewing tobacco could suggest that the availability of smoking tobacco (loose, flake or plug) for chewing has contributed to this situation. Because chewingwas generally confined to older men this may be a contributing factor to the highprevalence of smoking among younger men in Central Australia. On the other hand,young girls were taught to chew tobacco and this may be the reason why there is alow prevalence of smoking among women in Central Australia. The NorthernTerritory is the only State or Territory in which boys' smoking levels are greater thangirls. 46 4.26 At this stage, it is not known what effect the chewing of smoking tobacco has on Aboriginal people's health, and this will probably not be evident for some time.Both the Duboisia hopwoodii or pituri plant traditionally chewed in Central Australia, and also the Nicotania plant known as 'bush tobacco', and chewed in the Katherine/Centre regions both contain nicotine. The raw tobacco of these plants wasmixed with saliva or water and ash made from Eucalyptus. It has been suggested that the alkali ash may potentiate the nicotine effect. 47 However, when smoking tobacco became available Aboriginals may have switched to this form of tobacco because,traditionally, the only obtainable tobacco was Nicotania which was only available at certain times of the year and in particular locations. 48 Thus, the health effects of having constant access to a supply of tobacco for chewing may not become apparentfor some years. However, although it is known that chewing tobacco may increasethe likelihood of developing carcinomas of the mouth and jaw, these cancers are notprevalent in Aboriginal people at present. 49 Aboriginal mortality and hospitalisation Western Australia 4.27 In Western Australia, in the period 1983 to 1991, tobacco smoking was responsible for 13 per cent of all Aboriginal deaths, compared to 10 per cent ofAboriginal deaths being related to excessive alcohol consumption. In 1989-91 theage-standardised death rate 50 for tobacco-caused deaths was twice as high for Aboriginal males, than non-Aboriginal males. For Aboriginal females the age-standardised rate was four times the rate for non-Aboriginal females. 51 4.28 Hospital admissions for tobacco-related illnesses were also higher for Aboriginals. Aboriginal males were admitted to hospital at three times the rate ofnon-Aboriginal males, and Aboriginal females at five times the rate. 52 This same 46 Submission No.39, p.3 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Human Services). 47 Watson, op. cit., p.72. 48 ibid. 49 ibid., p.72. 50 A standardised death rate is one which has been standardised for differences in the age distribution.51 Unwin, op. cit., p.12. 52. ibid., p.22.108study shows, in terms of numbers of deaths rather than rates, that tobacco smoking caused deaths among Aboriginals at much younger ages than it did among non-Aboriginals, with 49 per cent of male deaths and 48 per cent of female deaths amongAboriginals occurring before the age of 55 years. 53 For non-Aboriginals only 11 per cent of male and 10 per cent of female deaths due to smoking occurred before thatage. The age patterns of deaths caused by alcohol use and tobacco smoking weresimilar, but in 1989-91 the age-specific death rates were generally higher for tobaccosmoking than for alcohol use, with the highest rate differences being in the 75 yearsand above age group. 54 As well, tobacco-related deaths which occurred in Aboriginal children under 15 years of age were due to fire injuries, low birthweight, and suddeninfant death syndrome. 55 4.29 The Western Australian study has also shown that, although between 1983- 1985 and 1989-91 the estimated number of deaths caused by tobacco smokingincreased by 7 per cent overall, the age-standardised rate did not increasesignificantly. This may reflect changes in the size and structure of the population.However, Unwin et al. point out that the overall figures conceal some differences in the changes between Aborigines and non-Aborigines and between males and females.For Aboriginal males, there was a slight decrease in the age-standardised rate ofdeaths between 1983-1985 and 1989-1991 which was not statistically significant.Although there was an increase in the rate for Aboriginal females this was also notstatistically significant. In contrast, the age-standardised rates of deaths among non-Aboriginal males and females caused by tobacco smoking changed significantlybetween 1983-1985 and 1989-1991. The rate for non-Aboriginal males decreasedfrom 136 to 113 deaths per 100 000 person-years, and the rate for non-Aboriginalfemales increased from 25 to 32 per 100 000 person-years. 56 The overall age-patterns of deaths caused by tobacco smoking remained largely unchanged over the period1983-1991, with the only generally consistent change being reductions in age-specificdeath rates for non-Aboriginal males. 57 53. deaths (and age-standardised death rates*) for the most common causes of death due to tobacco smoking in Western Australia, 1989-1991 Males Females Aboriginal Ischaemic heart disease 37.7 (99) 16.7 (46) Lung cancer 15.3 (47) 3.8 (11)Chronic bronchitis 12.7 (40) 4.9 (16)All tobacco-related causes 99.0 (118) Non-Aboriginal Lung Source: E.

The new package has been developed by Aboriginal peopleand, although it has been particularly designed for a Noongar audience to highlightproblems which particularly affect people in that community, amendments can bemade to cater for regional differences. 58 Aboriginal women's health 4.31 Smoking is more prevalent among Aboriginal women than it is among non- Aboriginal women. At the time the ABS National Health Survey was conducted in1989-90, 42 per cent of indigenous women aged 18 years and over were smokers,compared with a figure of 25 per cent for all Australian women. It was also found 58 Marr Mooditj Foundation Incorporated and Health Promotion Services, Gnummari Wa You Won't Go Far: Say Goodbye to Smokes , Health Department of Western Australia, Perth, 1995.110that a higher proportion 57 per cent of all Australian women had never smoked, as opposed to 42 per cent of indigenous women, and 79 per cent of indigenouswomen who smoked had smoked for 10 years or more, which compared with 71 percent for women generally. 59 4.32 Although diseases of the circulatory system were the leading cause of death for both female and male indigenous Australians for the combined years 1988 to1990, this was also the case for the Australian population as a whole. 60 However ATSI women, in particular, have specific health problems and it has been suggestedin a number of studies that these health-related problems could be exacerbated bysmoking. 61 For instance, in the Northern Territory, female Aboriginal death rates from respiratory conditions are exceedingly high, being 12 times the non-AboriginalTerritorian female death rate, and 15 times the Australian female death rate. 62 4.33 Tobacco smoking was also found to be a high risk factor for Aboriginal women during pregnancy.63 A study of Aboriginal women from Arnhem Land found that a total of 72 per cent smoked during their pregnancy. Although there may beother factors, including environmental and nutritional factors, 14 per cent of theinfants were born before term and 19 per cent had low birthweights. 64 4.34 Smoking has also been found to be a risk factor for cervical cancer. The incidence of mortality rates for this type of cancer in Aboriginal women in Australiahas been found to be more in accordance with that of developing countries. Althoughnot confined to Aboriginal women, the rate of cervical cancer amongst womensmokers was 4.5 times that of non-smokers, and as the number of cigarettes per dayincreased, so did the rate of cancer. 65 4.35 In an effort to address the problem of tobacco use in ATSI communities, DHS&H advised the Committee that it is proposed to undertake an Aboriginal andTorres Strait Islander Tobacco and Health Education Strategy. 66 The objective for phase one of the Strategy is to conduct comprehensive qualitative research on issuessurrounding tobacco use in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communitiesthroughout Australia. The Strategy consists of a pilot program of research to be 59 Australian Bureau of Statistics, Women's Health, 1994, p.130-31. 60 ibid., p.130. 61 ibid., p.130-31. 62 Submission No.39, p.6 (Northern Territory Department of Health and Community Services).63 D.

Brock, 'The Cervical in Australia', Cancer Forum , Vol.15(1), March 1991, pp.18-20. 66 The Strategy is currently awaiting Ministerial approval. See letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.17.111conducted in the Northern Territory and Western Australia with a budget of $200 000. It is proposed that research be conducted on a national basis, followingevaluation of the results from the pilot study. After implementation of phase one ofthe Strategy, the results of the research will lead to the development andimplementation of culturally specific and targeted education and program materials. 67 Conclusions 4.36 Although tobacco use is one of the contributory factors in Aboriginal people having poor health, their health problems are also related to structural problems suchas unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, inadequate water supply,access to transport etc. The Committee feels that, as well as culturally appropriateprograms to reduce the prevalence of smoking amongst ATSI people living in bothrural and urban areas, there is also need to examine the underlying issues whichaffect health. Recommendations 35. That strategies, sensitive to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultural values, be implemented to address the problem of tobacco use in Aboriginal andIslander communities, and that these strategies include: close liaison with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community-based health organisations, especially the Aboriginal Health Services; and the dissemination of culturally appropriate information on tobacco use throughout Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. 36. That further research be conducted to examine the problem of tobacco use by Aboriginal people in urban areas. 37. That funding be provided by the Commonwealth Government for culturally appropriate programs and strategies to address the problem of tobacco use inAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, as part of a broader healthstrategy. People from non-English speaking backgrounds 4.37 Different health problems related to tobacco use are found in ethnic communities, some of which are related to cultural practices and/or the country oforigin. An ABS survey undertaken in 1989-90 showed that the proportion of peoplewho were current smokers at that time was higher among overseas-born men thanAustralian-born men. Among men, the proportion who had ever smoked (currentsmokers plus ex-smokers) was highest at the late adult and oldest ages, and again the 67 ibid.112proportions were higher for overseas-born males.68 In contrast, among women there was less difference between Australian-born and overseas-born women, with theproportion of women who have ever smoked being highest at the youngest ages, anddeclining at each successive age, indicating a relatively recent increased adoption ofsmoking among women. 69 4.38 Age-standardised ratios70 of the proportions of men smoking at the time the 1989-90 National Health Survey was conducted showed that the highest levels wereamong Poles, Greeks, men from the Middle East, Yugoslavs, Vietnamese andItalians; the lowest proportions were shown to occur among people from Malaysia,India, and China. 71 Age-standardised ratios for women indicated that the highest proportion of people who were current smokers occurred among those from NewZealand, the United Kingdom and Ireland, Germany, Poland, followed by those fromthe Middle East and North Africa, the Netherlands, and the Australian-born. Thelowest proportion of smokers at the time of the survey occurred among women fromthe United States, India, Italy and Greece. 72 4.39 For some countries of birth there is a marked contrast between the age- standardised ratios of men and women relative to all men and all women, forexample, the relatively high age-standardised ratios of Greek, Yugoslav and Italianmen compared with the relatively low age-standardised ratios for women from thosecountries. 73 However, there is evidence of high age-standardised ratios among both men and women from Poland, the Middle East and North Africa and from NewZealand, relative to all men and women. 74 4.40 Data from the ABS National Health Survey figures and the National Heart Foundation 1989 Risk Factor Prevalence Survey both indicate high proportions ofsmokers among men from southern Europe and the Middle East, and moderate levelsamong those from western Europe. Similarly, both sets of data indicate low levels ofsmokers among women from southern Europe and from Asia, moderate levels amongwomen from north-east Europe, and slightly higher levels among women from 68 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Immigrants in Australia: A Health Profile , Ethnic Health Series, No.1, 1992, pp.139-40. However, these figures would also have included people who, althoughborn overseas, would not have been from NESB backgrounds. 69 ibid. 70 Age-adjustment (or age-standardisation) if comparing two populations where the age structures differ dramatically, crude rates (such as the crude death rate) are unreliable indicators of difference.The statistical technique of age-adjustment (the application of age-specific rates to a standardpopulation structure) is applied to reduce the effect of differing population age structures. See AIHW, Australian Health Trends 1995, AGPS, Canberra, 1995, p.109). 71 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, op. cit., p.140. 72 ibid. 73 ibid. 74 ibid.113western Europe.75 However, the National Heart Foundation data differ from that of the ABS. They indicate low levels of smoking among men from New Zealand andnorth-east Europe, high levels of smoking among men from Asia, and lower levels ofsmoking among women from the United Kingdom and Ireland, New Zealand, theMiddle East and North Africa. 76 4.41 The age-standardised ratios for women indicate that the highest proportion of current smokers in 1989-90 was among women from New Zealand, the UnitedKingdom and Ireland, Germany, Poland, followed by those from the Middle East and North Africa, the Netherlands, and the Australian-born the lowest proportion occurring among women from the United States, India, Italy and Greece. 77 Another study found that men born in Scotland, Ireland, Southern Europe and the Middle Eastwere more likely to be smokers; also women from Scotland, Ireland and WesternEurope, while those from Greece, Italy, South-East Asia and other parts of Asia wereless likely to smoke. 78 Per head of population Australia has more smokers than the United States, Canada and New Zealand.79 4.42 The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found that there are significant differentials in risk factors by country of birth grouping. Among adultAustralians aged 25 to 64 years men, but not women, born in continental Europewere more likely to be smokers (31 per cent higher). Other statistics relating topeople born overseas show that women, but not men, born in the United Kingdomand Ireland were more likely to be smokers (18 per cent higher). 80 4.43 Amongst specific ethnic communities, such as the Vietnamese, Greek, and Spanish-speaking communities, tobacco, alcohol and broader health issues weregenerally viewed as very low community concerns. Relatively few people identifiedtobacco as a drug, or were aware that tobacco was a leading cause of death. A highpercentage of these communities believed that they did not have enough informationabout the health risks of tobacco use and other drugs. Amongst these communities itwas considered that community-based education programs should be implemented toaddress the problem and that bi-lingual workers in strategically-located centres wereneeded to assist people who were experiencing problems. 81 In a study of the 75 ibid. 76 ibid. 77 ibid. 78 Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian Health Indicators Bulletin .

Flaherty, Alcohol and Other Drug Use, Attitudes and Knowledge Amongst Greek-Speakers in Sydney , May 1994; S. Bertram and B. Flaherty, Alcohol and Other Drug Use, Attitudes and Knowledge Amongst Spanish-114Vietnamese-speaking community in Sydney a high use of tobacco was reported by men (42 per cent). This was ten times higher than that of Vietnamese-speakingwomen (4 per cent). 82 In the Greek community 31 per cent of men reported they were regular users of tobacco, compared with 10 per cent of Greek women.83 A study of the Spanish community showed that 28 per cent of men and 15 per cent of womensmoked regularly. 84 In this community it was reported that the high use of tobacco amongst men was often because of habits already established in their country of birth.However, tobacco use amongst overseas-born Spanish women was thought to berelated to age and, in the case of young women, was approaching that of men. 85 4.44 Indications are that ethnic peoples' cultural backgrounds, particularly if they were born overseas, have a direct impact on their attitudes to tobacco smoking. Forinstance, high rates of smoking for Greek males reflect the fact that in Greecesmoking has always been a status symbol. Combined with the fact that, in terms ofper capita consumption, Greece is the second largest consumer of manufacturedcigarettes in the world, may help to explain the long-established smoking traditionamongst Greek Australians. 86 It has been reported that smoking was the most serious drug problem facing the Greek community.87 4.45 Culture also affects smoking in Vietnam where it is considered to be a status symbol or symbol of manhood and acceptance among other men. Smoking was alsoconsidered necessary to conduct business relations. Evidence has indicated thatsmoking starts during or before the teenage years and there is little attempt to controltobacco use in Vietnam. Barriers to tobacco control included low priority bygovernment and doctors, cultural and social factors and the influence of the tobaccoindustry. 88 This factor could account for the reason why Vietnamese-speaking people interviewed in a study were much less aware of the harm caused by tobacco than the Speakers in Sydney and Wollongong , March 1993, Research Grant Report Series, Drug and Alcohol Directorate, NSW Health Department. 82 S.

However, males were 37 per cent more likely than females (4 per cent) toreport that they smoked tobacco on the day of the survey. But, when compared to thegeneral Australian community, the use of tobacco on a daily basis amongVietnamese-speaking men was 37 per cent compared with 26 per cent, and in the case of Vietnamese-speaking women was much lower 4 per cent, compared to 22 per cent. 90 The study also found that among Vietnamese-speakers, the unemployed were more likely to report using tobacco on the day of the survey (49 per cent), than othergroups (25 per cent). Also, 72 per cent of the people interviewed reported that theyfirst started smoking in Vietnam. 91 4.46 Amongst the Chinese-speaking community, although there were no differences between smokers and non-smokers in terms of nominated health or social problemsassociated with tobacco use, the most common social problem associated withtobacco use was identified as passive smoking. 92 These findings suggest that the Chinese community may now be more receptive to the current anti-smokingcampaigns that focused on the problems of passive smoking, particularly if instigatedat a community level. 93 However, a study conducted amongst the Chinese community in Sydney found that men were far more likely than women to have smoked tobacco.This situation was most marked for the 25-39 year group. 94 Others mentioned that smoking was an important social habit for the elderly, and some evidence suggeststhat young, unemployed Chinese smoked to relieve boredom. 95 4.47 Chinese cultural practices have an important influence on smoking trends in the Chinese-speaking community. The main reason the Chinese smoke is for socialreasons. The offering of cigarettes is seen as a sign of hospitality and friendship.Smoking represents acceptance of this hospitality. It has therefore been suggestedthat the social needs of the Chinese need to be addressed in education campaignswhich promote role models for refusing cigarettes and creating an environment inwhich smoking is seen as an anti-social behaviour. 96 4.48 Ethnic origin has also been found to be a statistically-significant predictor of smoking behaviour in school children aged 9 to 15 years. For example, significantly 89 ibid., p.29. 90 ibid., pp.42-3. 91 ibid., pp.43-4. 92 S. Everingham, and B. Flaherty, Alcohol and other Drug Use, Attitudes and Knowledge Amongst Chinese-Speakers in Sydney , Drug and Alcohol Directorate, NSW Health Department, June 1995, 93 ibid. p.80.116fewer children of Asian origin are smokers compared with other non-English speaking children in the same age group.97 Research by Gliksman et al. found that the differences in the prevalence of smoking in children of ethnic origin stronglysuggests an important role for cultural as well as familial factors in determining thesmoking behaviour of children. Therefore, the smoking behaviour of influentialwomen, particularly mothers, may be of importance in the smoking behaviour ofchildren, and that this may be particularly so for certain ethnic groups. 98 4.49 The prevalence of coronary heart disease risk factors varies with ethnic origin in adults and children, with persons of Asian ethnic origin generally appearing tohave the lowest level of risk factors, with the notable exception of the prevalence ofcigarette smoking. 99 However, closer examination of the patterns of cigarette smoking among Asian adults revealed that while this prevalence is very high amongmen, it is very low among women.. 100 4.50 As has been shown above, and as the Drug & Alcohol Multicultural Education Centre has concluded in a report forming part of their submission to the Committee,the ethnic communities in Australia cannot be treated as a homogeneous group. Insome non-English speaking communities tobacco use is much higher than that foundin the general Australian population. 101 As a result of studies into the Vietnamese, Greek and Chinese-speaking communities, prevention strategies which wererecommended included the provision of effective information via the media to theethnic communities and, in particular, information on the contribution of tobaccosmoking to specific causes of mortality and morbidity. 102 4.51 The Department of Human Services and Health advised the Committee that a specific NESB tobacco and health education strategy is being developed to ensurethat the needs of people from non-English speaking backgrounds are addressed. Asan initial step in implementing this strategy a comprehensive research project will be 97 M.

The Committee feels this may best be achieved through liaison withethnic organisations, migrant health services, and the ethnic media. In this wayappropriate programs can be developed to address the particular issues of people inmost need, taking into account specific cultural situations and language requirements. Recommendations The Committee RECOMMENDS: 38. That strategies, sensitive to the cultural backgrounds and values of people from non-English speaking backgrounds, be implemented to address the problem oftobacco use in these communities. 39. That funding be provided by the Commonwealth Government for programs to address the problem of tobacco use amongst people from non-English speakingbackgrounds, including older people. Senator John Herron Chairman December 1995 103 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.17.118119DISSENTING REPORT BY SENATORS NICK MINCHIN AND SUE KNOWLES The Senate Committee report on the Tobacco Industry and the Costs of Tobacco- related Illness has, in the main, our wide support. The recommendations that seek toencourage people to stop smoking and discourage young people from taking up thehabit are to be applauded. However, in dissenting from the Majority Report we wish to record our opposition to those recommendations in particular which seek to regulate further an industry thatwe believe is already subject to a high level of regulation. It was emphasised bywitnesses during the inquiry that the tobacco industry is already the most highly regulated industry in Australia. 1 We believe that further regulation should only be introduced to address specific and clearly identified problems and should only beadopted if it is clear that legislative intervention will provide an effective solution.We do not believe that the majority has made a convincing case in this regard. We also oppose those recommendations that seek to intrude into areas that are more properly the responsibility of the States and Territories or that will have an adverseimpact on business, especially small business. We support those recommendations in the majority report that seek to discourage tobacco use amongst adolescents, and we agree that this is best achieved throughmeans such as educational initiatives (recommendations 14-16), introducing aminimum age for the purchase of tobacco products (recommendation 23), andrequiring proof-of-age to purchase tobacco products (recommendation 24). We donot consider that restricting the number of retail outlets or other regulatory measuresare appropriate, nor are they likely to be effective in reducing access by minors totobacco products. We are grateful that the majority report has accepted our recommendation to go further than merely recommending that a minimum age of 18 years for the purchaseof tobacco products be introduced (recommendation 23). We believe that the States and Territories should investigate the feasibility of making it an offence for persons under the age of 18 years to purchase tobacco products. Weconsider that in order to encourage compliance with the law there is a need topenalise children and adolescents in some manner in order to deter them fromattempting to purchase tobacco products. We believe that such a measure wouldencourage individual responsibility on behalf of adolescents, assist parents in theirresponsibility to prevent under-age smoking, and lessen the onus on proprietors of 1 See Submission No. 45, p.1 (Wills).120accepting the full responsibility for the sale of tobacco products to minors, as is the case at present. Senator Minchin wishes to record his dissent from the Committee's statements that it believes cigarettes are addictive (1.25) and that passive smoking causes a number ofadverse health effects for non-smokers (1.34). The Committee's terms of reference did not ask it to reach conclusions on these controversial issues, and nor was sufficient evidence from both sides of thearguments brought to bear. These are medical conclusions which it is inappropriate for this Senate Committee of inquiry to reach. Our response to those recommendations in the majority report which we oppose are detailed below. Recommendation 1: That smoking not be permitted in enclosed places, including office, factory, shop or other work sites, shopping centres, restaurants, theatres, hotels and sportingvenues. Recommendation 2: That in respect of offices, shops, restaurants etc., outdoor or separatelyventilated indoor spaces be made available for smokers, but that staff not becompelled to work in, or service, these areas. The adoption of smoke-free policies in the workplace should arise from arrangements entered into between management and employees, as occurs at present. Thesepolicies should not be 'directives' imposed by the Commonwealth. With regard torestaurants, an increasing number currently offer patrons the opportunity to select asmoking or non-smoking section. Imposing a total smoke-free policy on restaurantswould create economic problems for many in the industry through a loss of restaurantpatronage. We believe that imposing a non-smoking ban on outdoor sporting venues is not practical and would discriminate against smokers who use such venues for legitimateentertainment purposes. We also consider that the economic cost to industry ofimposing smoking bans in the workplace, shopping centres, and restaurants, would beconsiderable, especially for small businesses.121Senator Minchin believes that: Proponents of bans on smoking in the workplace and other public places base their demands on the premise that tobacco in the air passive smoking can harm the health of non-smokers. These claims are not yet conclusively proved. For example, it has been estimated that in a workplace that permits smoking, it would take between 260 and 1000 hours for anon-smoking worker to be exposed to the nicotine equivalent of a single cigarette. Aworker might be exposed to between 2 and 4 cigarette equivalents in a full year ofwork. It has also been estimated that it would take 300 hours of dining in a restaurantthat permits smoking, to be exposed to the nicotine equivalent of one cigarette. 2 More generally there is insufficient evidence to link passive smoking with a range ofadverse health effects. A recent major study commissioned by the Tobacco Instituteof Australia concluded that the data did not support a causal relationship betweenexposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and lung cancer or heart disease inadults. In relation to the health effects on children, the study concluded that whileexposure to ETS is associated with an increased risk of lower respiratory tractinfections in infants, there is a weak association between exposure to ETS in infancyand the subsequent likelihood of developing asthma. The study also argues thatexposure to ETS was associated with only a small increase in risk for upperrespiratory tract infection in children. 3 These findings have also been supported in evidence to the Committee by the Tobacco Institute and Philip Morris.4 Recommendation 5: That the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 be amended to remove the provision for the exemption of publication of tobacco advertisements inassociation with specified sporting and cultural events of internationalsignificance and that this be phased in by the year 2000. We do not support this recommendation and believe that the current exemption for tobacco-related sponsorship of sporting and cultural events of national significancethat might otherwise be not held in Australia should remain. Events that are permitted under the current exemption provisions are of considerable importance for State economies, bringing additional revenue into those States andproviding many job opportunities. We are concerned that without the exemption,many events, such as the Formula One Grand Prix, Telstra Rally Australia and the 2 Submission No. 44, Appendix 5, section 1 (Philip Morris). 3 J. Lee et al., Health Aspects of Environmental Tobacco Smoke , November 1994, pp.viii-xi. 4 See Submission No. 43, pp. 9-10 (Tobacco Institute of Australia); Submission No. 44, Appendix 5, section 1 (Philip Morris).122Australian motorcycle and Indy Car Grand Prix would not be held in Australia and would thereby deprive the Australian sporting community of the opportunity to viewsporting events of international standard. International teams are generally notsponsored by local tobacco companies. We are also not convinced that sufficient evidence exists to support the claims that advertising sponsorship by tobacco companies of such major sporting events acts as advertising by encouraging children to take up smoking. The tobacco companiesadmitted that, in general, such advertising around the world encouraged brandchanging more than motivating people to start smoking. 5 The events that are currently permitted are held under very stringent conditions, laiddown by the Minister for Human Services and Health, on the type of advertising thatis allowed. We note that in granting an exemption for tobacco advertising at the 1996Melbourne Grand Prix the Minister applied the most stringent conditions ever appliedby the Commonwealth Government to such an event. Tobacco advertising at thatevent will only be permitted where it relates to existing international contracts fortrack signage and sponsorship of teams and drivers. Signage other than thatassociated with the driving teams will be required to carry health warnings, and willbe required to occupy at least 25 per cent of the total area of each sign. In addition,advertising away from the track will be prohibited. 6 We believe that these conditions are a 'fair compromise' that allow events ofinternational significance to be seen and enjoyed by the Australian communitygenerally. Recommendation 6: That the Commonwealth Government establish a national health promotion foundation or other appropriate national body to provide an alternative sourceof sponsorship funding to that provided by tobacco companies for majorsporting and cultural events. We question the feasibility of establishing a national foundation when foundations currently exist in several States and the ACT. This surely begs the question of whysuch a foundation is needed at the national level. It would surely be more costeffective for these foundations to co-ordinate their activities and minimiseadministrative costs. Certainly no national foundation should be established before conducting a detailed analysis of the operations of the State Foundations. 5 Supplementary Submission No.44, section 5 (Phillip Morris). 6 Minister for Human Services and Health, News Release , 20 September 1995.123Recommendation 8: That, while the Committee favours the listing of nicotine in tobacco prepared and packed for smoking as a Schedule 7 poison by the National Drugs andPoisons Schedule Committee, it believes that further investigation of theimplications of this proposal should be undertaken by the Council of AustralianGovernments and the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council. We do not support the first part of the recommendation until assessment of the implications of such a move , and especially, the effect listing would have on the availability of tobacco products to Australian consumers, has been made . Given that monitoring and implementation of such a proposal rests with the States and Territories, we are also concerned that insufficient attention has been paid in the Majority Report to questions of how such a measure could be effectivelyimplemented. In the areas of product labelling and health warnings two areas that may potentially be affected by Scheduling the current consumer information provided on tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels in cigarettes and the health warnings on packs(that are required to occupy 25 per cent of the pack) is more than sufficient. The Commonwealth Department of Human Services and Health (DHS&H) advised the Committee that 'scheduling', as a means of regulatory control of drugs andpoisons or as a means of achieving desirable health outcomes, is not an automatic,nor necessarily the best, choice for governments. 7 The Department argued that in the case of tobacco, other methods, such as demand reduction in the form of educationalcampaigns and warning labels, are more appropriate. DHS&H stated that: This strategy excludes scheduling as a supply-reduction measure, because the habit is so widespread in the community and restrictivescheduling would be difficult to implement. Prohibitive scheduling oftobacco has the potential to create social problems similar to thoseexperienced when outright prohibition of alcohol was attempted in theUSA. 8 We share these concerns. 7 Letter from DHS&H to the Committee, dated 23 October 1995, p.10. 8 ibid.124Recommendation 11: That a list of the ingredients in tobacco products, and their effects, be distributed (in an appropriate form) with all tobacco products sold in Australia. We consider that, if individual consumers wish to know what particular additives are in particular brands of cigarettes, a composite list of additives provided by thetobacco companies could be made available to the public through the CommonwealthDepartment of Human Services and Health upon application. We do not support this recommendation as it would not be practical to provide a list of additives with tobacco products sold in Australia. Further, we consider that there isno demonstrated consumer demand that such information be disclosed. We note that in 1992 Commonwealth and State Health Ministers considered the question of additives and concluded that the health risks from known additives werenot significant and that further action to provide more consumer information ontobacco additives was not justified. This decision was reaffirmed by the MinisterialCouncil on Drug Strategy in June 1995. 9 We are also concerned that a requirement to disclose additives would compel tobaccocompanies to disclose commercially sensitive material, and this would be potentiallydamaging to the individual companies. Evidence to the Committee from one tobaccocompany noted that: There are also some commercial issues. There are trade formulas, much like the Coca-Cola formula, and putting them on the side of our packwould be giving our competitors a distinct commercial advantage. Welike to think that our cigarettes are superior to theirs, and I am sure theylike to think the same about their own products. But there arecommercial issues here about putting formulas and ingredients on thesides of packs. There would need to be commercial protection. 10 Recommendation 17: That no smoking be permitted (including smoking by students, staff, parents and visitors) on any school premises; and that students who are found in breachof this be counselled, and supported through drug education and 'Quit' smokingprograms. 9 ibid., pp.11-12. 10 Transcript of Evidence , p.487 (Philip Morris).125This issue is more appropriately left to individual school communities. This is yet another attempt by the Commonwealth to 'impose' solutions on the States andTerritories. We consider that any moves towards the implementation of non-smokingpolicies in schools should be done in consultation with the local school communities and the State and Territory governments . Recommendation 21: That the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments ensure that there are regular real increases in levels of excise duties and business franchise feeslevied on tobacco products; and that the revenue from these taxation increasesbe directed to tobacco control and health promotion activities. We do not support the recommendation that there be regular real or excessive increases in the levels of excise duties and business franchise fees levied on tobaccoproducts. We support the current arrangements whereby excise duties are indexed inline with movements in the CPI. The current levels of tobacco taxation are already excessive. Total tobacco taxation (excise plus State tobacco franchise fees) has escalated substantially during the 1980sand 1990s. The rate of excise on cigarettes has increased by 13 per cent in real terms in the period 1982-94. This, coupled with the enormous increases in State LicenceFees, means that total tobacco taxation receipts have increased in real terms from$1.7 billion in 1981-82 to $3.3 billion in 1993-94, an increase of 96 per cent. 11 ACIL has estimated that smokers are already taxed an additional $2.2 billion overand above their use of subsidised health care. 12 Tobacco taxes are also a regressive form of taxation because a higher proportion ofsmokers are from lower socio-economic groups; thus, a higher proportion of theirtotal expenditure goes on tobacco products. Data from the 1988-89 ABS HouseholdExpenditure Survey show that tobacco product consumption amounts to just over5 per cent for the lowest income groups compared to only 2 per cent for the highestincome groups. 13 Tobacco taxation is very inequitable. Further tax increases will only hurt lowerincome groups and the poor. It is unfair and inequitable that the tax burden falls mostheavily on those in our society least able to bear it. In addition, as the demand for tobacco is relatively resilient to price increases, smokers may forego consumption in other areas rather than limit their consumption 11 Supplementary Submission No.45, p.4 (Wills). 12 ACIL, Smoking: Costs and Benefits for Australia , March 1994, p.vii. 13 Supplementary Submission No.45, p.4 (Wills).126of tobacco. This can have undesirable consequences, for example, smokers may divert resources from spending on food, health care or education to fund theirspending on purchases of cigarettes. Senator Minchin wishes to record that he does not support the second part of the recommendation that proposes any revenue from the proposed tobacco taxationincreases be directed to tobacco control activities. His stand is based on opposition tothe principle of hypothecating, or dedicating, taxes to a particular purpose. Senator Minchin also wishes to record his dissatisfaction with the Majority Report's apparent reliance on the Collins & Lapsley studies, in preference to the ACIL study,to justify its conclusion that even greater 'cost-recovery' should be extracted fromsmokers. Senator Minchin notes that the ACIL study was reviewed by three eminent economists (Professor Tollison, Professor Parish and Dr Albon). All three concluded that the ACIL approach was superior to Collins and Lapsley, and that the Collins and Lapsley methodology was seriously flawed. 14 Professor Parish noted in his review that 'the C and L study does not conform to anyof the standard canons of cost-benefit methodology and, in my opinion, is largelynonsense'. 15 Recommendation 22: That tobacco products be removed from the basket of goods used in the calculation of the Consumer Price Index. We do not support this recommendation. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) aims to give a guide to the movements of consumer prices generally and the exclusion of oneitem of the expenditure (eg. tobacco products) of relative importance in terms ofhousehold budget for many households, would only distort the index. If tobaccoproducts were excluded from the CPI there would be little reason why other productswould not be excluded. One submission to the Committee stated that 'any adjustment of the CPI, either to the respective weights of the existing CPI basket or to the goods or services included inthe basket, should continue to be based on an objective assessment of the currentexpenditure patterns of Australians'. 16 14 See Submission No. 65 (ACIL), Appendices 1-3. 15 R. Parish, Comments on ACIL 'Smoking: Costs and Benefits for Australia' , Monash University, March 1994, p.6, cited in Submission No. 65 (ACIL). 16 Supplementary Submission No.44, section 4, p.2 (Philip Morris).127We also consider that the Majority Report recommendation would mask the inflationary effects of tax-driven price increases. Removing tobacco from the CPI would severely disadvantage Australian workers and social security recipients as the wages of many Australian workers and the paymentsto social security recipients are indexed to rises in the CPI. 17 Recommendation 25: That there be a reduction in the number of retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products and that: as an interim measure, tobacco products be isolated from other products for sale in all outlets currently selling tobacco products; and in the longer term, those retail outlets permitted to sell tobacco products be restricted to licensed premises and to tobacconists; and that this be phased into minimise any disruption to small business. In opposing this recommendation, we believe that the economic dislocation to business, and small business in particular, by restricting the number of retail outletspermitted to sell tobacco products would be catastrophic. Tobacco products represent a significant and profitable product category for many retailers. The marketing and sale of tobacco products is an integral part of thebusiness and income of tens of thousands of retailers. One submission stated that 'there are adverse consequences to the implementation of availability restrictions. Immense economic dislocation would be caused to thetobacco retail market by such restrictions; businesses would close and jobs would belost'. 18 Evidence to the Committee indicated the importance of tobacco sales to manybusinesses. For tobacconists, tobacco sales constitute 85 per cent of total dollar turnover. Corresponding percentages for other types of retail outlets are service stations (40 per cent), convenience stores (30.5 per cent), milk bars (25 per cent), andgrocery stores, including supermarkets (8 per cent). 19 Small retail outlets selling tobacco also provide employment for thousands of people,particularly young people and women. The employment opportunities provided are 17 See ibid., pp.1-2. 18 ibid., section 11 , p.1. 19 ibid.128extremely important in many communities, particularly country towns and small communities. At a time of high and increasing unemployment across Australia we deplore the fact that this measure would specifically discourage small business from expanding andproviding employment opportunities for Australians. Recommendation 26: That the licensing systems in all States and Territories provide for the suspension or revocation of a licence where retail outlets sell tobacco products tominors. In opposing this recommendation we consider that issues relating to licensing are matters that are more properly the responsibility of the States and Territories. Webelieve that this recommendation is yet another attempt by the Commonwealth todictate policy to the States and Territories. Recommendation 28: That, as it is virtually impossible to prevent access by children to cigarette vending machines, these types of vending machines be prohibited in all Statesand Territories. Such a measure would place many vending machine operators in severe financial difficulties and would put many vending machine operators out of business. Thisrecommendation, if implemented, is yet another attack on small business. We believe that if it became an offence for persons under the age of 18 years to purchase tobacco products (see recommendation 23), this would send a clear messageto minors that the purchase of cigarettes, from any source, should not becontemplated. The Majority Report itself notes that vending machines are currently restricted in all States to areas in which children and adolescents are not permitted without adultsupervision. The economic impact of this recommendation could mean: around 100 small businesses closing almost overnight; the write off of vending machinery with a purchase cost of some $73 million; loss of jobs for in excess of 500 people involved in installation, service and maintenance activities; and129 no change in the total consumption of tobacco, but arbitrary reduction of some $180 million in retail sales to different sales outlets.
