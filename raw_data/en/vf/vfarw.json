I had gone in for a facial and was given a small, beautifully cut Rose Quartz gemstone as a token of appreciation for my patronage. My initial reaction was skeptical - my limited knowledge of shiny rocks consisted only of witchcraft and crystal balls and ornamental 'hippie' stones. The inscription of my pretty pink rock spoke of the meaning and use behind the stone, channeling energy of compassion and peace, and that was something I could get behind. Energy is a powerful thing: good energy attracts you; bad vibes leave you drained. There is nothing chi chi or frou frou about this. In recent years, healing crystals have undergone a transformation from New Age hippy dippy accessories to booming billion-dollar industry. Major celebrities [swear](https://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-25945/9-celebs-who-swear-by-the-healing-effects-of-crystals.html) by them so we decided it was time for a beginner's guide to crystals so you can delve into A Brief History Of Crystals Stones encode the story of our planet, formed and forged during the evolution of earth. Older than humanity, they have adapted and retained all the movements and cataclysms of our world as a timeless database of knowledge. The [oldest](http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/24/world/oldest-earth-fragment/) ancient crystals date back 4.4 billion years and have been used throughout history. In the same way diamonds are valued in marriage as the most indestructible natural substance in the world, the importance of jade in Chinese culture is reflected in its status as the imperial gem of the Qing Dynasty. More so, it embodied the [Confucian](https://www.thoughtco.com/about-jade-culture-629197) virtues of courage, wisdom, and compassion. The brilliance of the stone is considered to be representative of purity while its hardness reflects intelligence. Native American tribes like the [Apaches](https://tskies.com/the-significance-of-turquoise-in-native-american-culture/) valued the gemstone turquoise as it symbolized strength and skill. They attached pieces to their bows to become precise hunters and warriors. Why We Value Crystals In the medical and scientific community, there are disputes as to the validity of crystal healing as an alternative medical technique. While there is no scientific evidence that gemstone treatments can be used to cure ailments and protect against diseases, proponents of crystals believe these precious stones are conduits for channeling energy - for healing, fertility, success, spiritual growth and much more. The use of crystals has gained traction and popularity at health spas to invoke a serene and relaxed environment as well as boutique fitness spaces (like wellness superstar Taryn Toomey's The Class) boasting a special [floor](https://www.wellandgood.com/good-sweat/taryn-toomey-opens-tribeca-workout-studio-launches-online-classes/) of crystals embedded to induce positive energies of intention and protection. For life happenings, there is probably a stone for every type of mood, crisis or want. Interestingly, crystals like diamond, blue sapphire, ruby, amethyst, citrine, and tourmaline naturally vibrate at a higher frequency, promoting increased cellular energy, microcirculation and clarity. This has led mother and daughter duo, Karen and Kristin Petrovich, to form [Sj\u00e4l Skincare](https://sjalskincare.com), a luxury skincare line that merges the elevated frequency emitted from the gemstones with scientific advances. Also, because crystals are highly stable against environmental change like temperature, they are used as frequency control devices in electronics like computers, smartphones, and satellites so whether you know it or not, crystals are all around you! Healing Crystals 101 There are tons of different stones out there used for a myriad of purposes and meanings. You can wear them as rings, bracelets, or necklaces, use them as decor around the home or hide them under your pillowcase. Gemstone junkies have also been known to place them in their bras in order to keep them close to their heart. Below a list of the crystals you need to know about. Rose Quartz Known as the love stone, Rose Quartz helps to heal the heart from stress and grief, raise self-esteem and restore confidence. Carrying gentle and soothing energies to help calm your emotions, this gemstone cleanses the aura from negativity and replaces them with feelings of hope, faith and inner peace. Citrine One of the few yellow gemstones in existence, Citrine is linked with clarity of the mind to help you boost energy and get things done. Associated with wealth and prosperity, citrine is meant to activate your creativity to attract success and abundance into your life. Lapis Lazuli A gemstone of awareness and truth, Lapis Lazuli promotes the energy of self-discovery and self-mastery. Having lapis lazuli in your jewelry or on your person enhances communication and inspires honesty in the written and spoken word. This stone is also said to help aid insomnia when worn to sleep, as it helps to let go of stress and anxiety. Black Obsidian Sourced from areas with high amounts of volcanic activity, Black Obsidian helps you to feel more grounded, deepening your connection to the Earth. A gemstone to eliminate all the negative or harmful energies in your body and environment, it is suggested to use Black Obsidian when traveling- think of it as carrying a piece of home with you. Amethyst Known as a sobriety stone, the Greeks named this purple quartz 'amethyst' meaning, \"not intoxicated or intoxicating,\" based on the gem's seeming ability to prevent drunkenness. Emotionally, amethyst is used to promote mental clarity and helps curb addictive behavior. Clear Quartz The center of many spiritual belief and practices, Clear Quartz have been highly prized for their icy beauty throughout the ages. Known as the master healer, this quartz enhances your connections with all earthly elements by amplifying the link between the spiritual and physical world. Famed energy medicine practitioner [Colleen McCann](http://goop.com/the-8-essential-crystals/) likens this gemstone to \"the black skinny jean of the crystal world, while all the other crystals are the tops that go with them. Every top you own can be paired with your skinnies.\" Where To Get Crystals In Hong Kong [Shakti 7121.
