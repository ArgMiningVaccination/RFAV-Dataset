The Board asked Jane Halton to pass on their appreciation to Patty Garcia for her se rvice on the Board. The NCDIC were asked to identify a recommendation for a new Board member . The Board delegated signing the previous Board meeting minutes to Jane Halton and Cherry Kang . The Board formally registered its thanks for all the work of CEPI staff in the context of COVID -19. Opening remarks Investors Council: Charlie Weller gave a summary from the Investors Council, noting Investors were supportive of CEPI's role in the Global COVID -19 Vaccine Supply Chain & Manufacturing Summit on 8th and 9th March 2021 , the recent launch of CEPI's Investment Case, and progress with COVAX, and that they had had a productive discussion when the Board Chair joined a recent Investors Council meeting. In addition, investors had discussed several key issues : How to balance continuing to focus on the COVID -19 portfolio on the one hand, but also initiating the Betacoronavirus broadly protective vaccine work on the other hand. Defining CEPI's ongoing role in achieving equitable access in the context of there now being a functioning commercial market for COVID -19 vaccines. The importance of low- and middle -income countries' (LMIC) engagement and capacity building . Strategy and replenishment - and specificall y CEPI's role as a connect or, the relevance of CEPI's work to national and regional security, and also the need for diversified funding while continuing to receive a high ODA co -efficient . CEO update: Richard Hatchett made focu ssing on: CEPI's portfolio. CEPI is launching a call for broadly protective COVID -19 and Betacoronavirus vaccines which requires urgent funding. Richard Hatchett noted CEPI was thinking about how to develop the portfolio in the context of variants and in context of short -term doses and longer - term ideal vaccine profiles. At the time of the meeting, over 300 million doses of vaccine had been administered globally, but with a highly inequitable distribution. Supply chain and manufacturing capacity were noted as significant issues. CEPI is actively working on evolving its strategy (and hiring a lead) for LMIC engagement. CEPI/B1 3/Minutes 3 CEPI 2.0 : CEPI's investment case launch was successful, and the UK, as Chair of the G7, has embraced the 100 -day goal for vaccine deve lopment . CEPI is working hard to partner with, influence, and ensure complementarity with evolving initiatives, including the G7, HERA, and other efforts . The Board noted the update, highlighting that it is important CEPI 2.0 focuses both on pandemics but also on epidemic diseases and the activities CEPI prioritised prior to COVID -19. Board Effectiveness Jeremy Farrar, CEPI Board Effectiveness lead, stressed the importance of proactively addressing what is needed f rom the CEPI Board in CEPI's next five -year cycle. He noted the Board and organisation have evolved rapidly but need to set themselves up to be truly strategic, especially in context of anticipated changes in the global health architecture . Key comments: It is critical to ensure CEPI's governance is pragmatic, fit -for-purpose, and effective . One area to include in any review or reflection is the Board Committees, given a lot of work happens there. There should be consistent values, ethos, and approach across C EPI's governance . One of CEPI's strengths is being agile and flexible. This is consistent with and encourages proactive preparation and adjusting as needed. CEPI should be wary of the constraints and challenges imposed by other multilateral agencies ' gove rnance systems. CEPI and Civil Society Engagement Richard Hatchett presented on the role of civil society organisations (CSOs) and perspectives in CEPI's work, building on a pre -circulated paper . Richard noted: Civil society is, by nature , plural, reflecti ng a vast array of perspectives and preoccupations . Joanne Liu served on the Board when she was the President of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF ) and added significant value. Since her departure in 2018 , CEPI has not had someone who could fully represent the perspectives of civil society on the Board. COVAX has consciously engaged CSOs , with monthly open meetings and CSO representatives invited to participate in the working structure including in the SWAT teams CEPI leads. Beyond the C OVID -19 response, CEPI has engaged with CSOs in a number of other ways, including working with Global Citizen, with MSF through the Ebola consortium in DRC, through CEPI .net, and through MSF and The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC ) on CEPI's Joint Coordination Group (JCG) . Key points in discussion: CEPI should explore a regular engagement/dialogue forum with CSOs. To do this effectively will require appropriate resource s and preparation . CEPI 's Board does not have constituency representation for any stakeholder group . The intent is for independent Board members to reflect a wide range of perspectives. In seeking candidates to fill current and future vacancies on the Board , civ il society expertise remains one of the top priorities . COVID -19/COVAX Melanie Saville presented on the CEPI portfolio . She highlighted the R&D objectives of securing 2 billion doses of COVID -19 vaccine in 2021 with a focus on speed , scale , and access; noted seven current active COVID -19 candidates in the Wave 1 portfolio ; that CEPI was developing the Wave 2 portfolio focussed on CEPI/B1 3/Minutes 4 vaccine improvements and reduced costs; and that CEPI was focussing closely on the need to adapt to variants. In addition, Melanie Saville highlighted the importance of de -risking tech transfer, removing bottlenecks that slow dose delivery, and that CEPI will support studies to further extend the use and flexibility of leading candidates by supporting targeted clinic al trials and mix -and -match studies. Andrew Witty joined as a guest speaker to reflect and frame discussion on CEPI's role, activities , and the opportunities ahead. He noted the critical role CEPI has played in the last 15 months in speeding up vaccine development, in establishing COVAX, and more broadly. Andrew focussed on areas for the Board to consider for the future: CEPI should ha ve a highly efficient business -as-usual mode with the capability to go into pandemics - but should not solely focus on pand emics. There are several COVAX achievements - such as establishing a global liability and indemnification regime , and a no-fault compensation mechanism for COVAX AMC participants - which are unprecedented and need to be carried into future efforts. Andrew highlighted technology transfer, scale -up, and flexibility of regulators as three critical issues. A wide -ranging discussion was held, focussing on Challenges and opportunities in the present moment o As well as focus sing on the longer term, it is critical CEPI and COVAX do everything they can to ensure equitable access in the immediate future . o There can be tensions within governments between a focus on domestic needs and on global equitable access o Now is the right tim e to focus on technology transfer, while recogni sing that there are limits to what can be achieved given that there is a limited global workforce with requisite expertise . o There is a very large focus within governments on healthcare, vaccines, and related issues - and an opportunity to leverage this interest .. o Because governments are focussed on short -term supply, it has been difficult to get traction on the continued need for R&D for variants, second generation vaccines , and broadly protective Betacorona virus vaccine. Challenges and opportunities in the mid -long term o The Board discussed the potential value of establishing manufacturing facilities and capacity in countries with small populations (who can then turn to global access quicker) . o CEPI has a sophisticated view of the landscape and should frame a narrative and view of what has worked in COVAX , what has not worked, and what needs to change. o It is critical to define who will be responsible for global surveillance . o Biopreparedness models may offer benefits for the future, especially in regional contexts . o Regulatory flexibility is critical. o There are numerous efforts underway to s ketch out a fit -for-purpose pandemic preparedness and response architecture for the future, including improved financing mechanisms, with proposals under development by the G7, G20, and others . Day EPI's finances COVID -19, noting CEPI had received funding of BUSD1.3, additional pledges of MUSD400, and had reallocated MUSD110 of funds to COVID -19 activities , adding up to a total of BUSD 1.8 for COVID -19. Manufacturing: Richard presented on a rece nt Chatham House Global COVID -19 Vaccine Supply Chain & Manufacturing Summit , which CEPI on behalf of COVAX had organised along with IFPMA, DCVMN, and CEPI/B1 3/Minutes 5 Bio. This followed CEPI receiving signals of concern regarding spot shortages and scarcity of critical in puts such as raw materials, consumables, and equipment; and longer lead times for delivery . In addition, spill over effects into other vaccines was a concern. In discussion : The Summit was highlighted as a success in building shared understanding across different actors operating in different places within the system. There ha ve been delay s in the delivery of anticipated suppl ies of doses for COVAX . This is partly due to manufacturing bottlenecks, but also the worsening epidemic in In dia and geopolitic al considerations elsewhere . It is critical that CEPI and C OVAX are not blamed for the realpolitik of countries focussing on domestic supply . Tracking the emerging variants and ensuring there is high vaccine efficacy against variants is essential. Technology transfer is important but takes time and requires expertise that is in short supply . A discussion on the AstraZeneca vaccine was held, noting the importance of good data , due evaluation, and clear and accurate communications . Richard noted that CEPI's broadly protective Betacoronavirus funding call would be published in late March and invite rolling submissions. This activity goes across CEPI's COVID -19 efforts and its core portfolio efforts. Resolutions: The Board reaffirmed the continued delegation to the EIC of decision making on COVID -19 investments, in partnership with the guidance and recommendations from th e Research, Development and Manufacturing Investment Committee (RDMIC ). The Board delegated, for 6 months initially, approval for investments in broadly protective Betacoronavirus vaccines to the EIC (up to MUSD200). The Board noted the revised investment categories and funding allocations . Core portfolio Melanie Saville noted CEPI's portfolio includes 18 candidates in development against priority pathogens (Lassa, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), MERS, Nipah, Chikungunya, COVID -19) and 3 candidates against Disease X. If COVID -19 efforts are included, CEPI will exc eed its initial targets for CEPI 1.0 of delivering 3 -4 Phase 3 ready vaccine candidates by the end of 2021. Melanie noted key upcoming portfolio activities: Key clinical milestones in 2021 will drive portfolio prioritisatio n. Strategic portfolio disease area reviews will help align on portfolio positioning and priorities . 10 cross -functional working groups working with CEPI's Scientific Advisory Committee to define CEPI 2.0 portfolio targets . There is a planned full portfolio review (incl uding COV ID-19 investments ) in Q4 with external stakeholders . In discussion : It is important CEPI remains committed to its initial objectives . A clear story about what CEPI 1.0 has achieved , and what has changed (and why) is important . mRNA has demonstrated its potential. CEPI2.0 and Disease X work should leverage this. There will be opportunity for countries to accelerate vaccine development/manufacturing capabilities rapidly. This will require developing talent, regulatory competence, and suppl y chains. Globally distributed manufacturing will be critical . Small population countries may offer potential as hubs to produce and commit to regional and global supply substantially beyond domestic needs. Resolution: The Board noted the update . CEPI/B1 3/Minutes 6 Strategy , ecosystem, and fundraising Frederik Kristensen and Samia Saad framed a discussion on how CEPI positions itself in the evolving ecosystem, how it continues to refine the 2.0 strategy, and its progress in fundraising for CEPI 2.0, noting: CEPI is adding greater definition to the outcomes and outputs of the 2.0 strategy. Some of the work, such as the broadly protective Betacoronavirus work, has been brought into 2021 ( with funds raised against current COVID -19 2021 activities positioned as a down -payment towards CEPI 2.0) . The re has been considerable focus on evolving CEPI's LMIC strategy . For CEPI to achieve its ambitions, it needs to participate in and help shape the evolution of the wider architecture. CEPI is working on securing a host country for its replenishment event and is also working closely with investors to secure their support for CEPI, including organising technical workshops with countries to explore how to connect and leverage national, regional, and global efforts and investments . CEPI is also exploring innovative financing mechanisms . Key points in discussion : The Board viewed the investment case event and document as very positive . CEPI is well positioned by having initiated its strategy development a year before others - the strategy includes clear, bold objectives which will appeal to governments (e.g. the UK G7 has embraced CEPI's 100 days goal) . CEPI is the first multilateral R&D vehicle at this scale. How COVID -19 vaccination coverage evolves, and what level of global equity there is, will frame the geopolitical dynamic into which reshaping the architecture occurs and how it is financed . There will need to be heightened engagem ent with several actors for CEPI 2.0, including developing country vaccine manufacturers, regional groups, and mult ilateral development banks . It is important for CEPI to define and communicate what it does and does not plan to take on . CEPI's BUSD3.5 fun ding ask is significant, and it needs to be clear what funds and fundraising are ODA -eligible , and what goes beyond ODA to health and health security budgets . CEPI needs to consider and define its engagement with regards to flu. Region al manufacturing capacity is going to be critical. CEPI should support regional self - suffi ciency. It will be important to present CEPI's focus on both epidemics and pandemics. CEPI's work on epidemics can be designed to leverage and be supportive of pandemic preparedness . Resolution: The Board noted the update, and asked management to prepare a paper on CEPI's engagement and thinking in terms of flu to the next Board. Due: June 2021 Day 3 Annual report and accounts Mads H \u00f8gholen presented on the annual report and accounts, noting the number of CEPI investors and the number of CEPI R&D projects has increased significantly. In addition, CEPI's staff almost doubled in size between 2019 and 2020. He noted that the presentation of the annual accounts was in line wi th Norwegian accounting rules. Tommy Ro mskaug (EY) presented on behalf of EY, CEPI's auditor. He noted there were no material unadjusted differences, and that EY would issue an unqualified audit opinion as soon as the Board signed and approved financial st atements. EY recommended t hat CEPI review whether some control procedures could be conducted , including by using external auditors, to prov ide assurance CEPI/B1 3/Minutes 7 over partner's management of CEPI funds. EY were unaware of any fraudulent activities and asked the Board if they were aware of any fraudulent activities, which they were not. Resolution: The Board endorsed the 2020 Annual report and the 2020 annual accounts. The Board meeting adjourned for th e Members meeting. The Board meeting then resumed. Financ e Mads H \u00f8gholen proposed an increase in CEPI's operating expenditures (OpEx) in light of increased activit y. In discussion , it was noted that CEPI should strengthen its audit function and should ensu re the reserves it holds are recalculated against a revised OpEx . Resolution : The Board endorsed the increase to OpEx for 2021 and noted the 2021 finance update . Committees A paper setting out Committee activities since the December Board was shared. In addition, it was noted: The Equitable Access Committee had met twice and focussed on how CEPI's agreements with companies connect into their partnerships with C OVAX Facility . The refreshed membership for the SAC is under review, with Helen Rees and Cherry Kang supporting its development . Manufacturin g and innovation will be areas to strengthen , and the EIC will approve the final membership list. The JCG met on March 23 and focused on activities of partners on COVID -19 and CEPI 2.0 plans. There will be a need to evolve the JCG for CEPI 2.0. Items to note: The Board noted papers on the investment case, CEPI partnership agreement summaries, follow up actions from the last Board meeting, and the forward look . Closed session: A closed session of the Board was held, which discussed cybersecurity and speci fic CEPI investment related updates and activities. The meeting closed. "}
