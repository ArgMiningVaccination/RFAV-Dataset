SPAM) indicate that these nuisance solicitations are finding their way into e-mail accounts with ever increasing frequency. Studies indicate that one of the leading ways spammers obtain legitimate e-mail addresses is through the use of \"spam-bots\", which are specialized com puter programs that automatically search, ferret out, harvest and amass e-mail addresses from web pages and other documents that are posted online (just like this report). Once a valid e-ma il address has been located, generally it will be added to a spammer's list and/or sold to other sp ammers, which is sure to dramatically increase the amount of spam received by that e-mail address. With this report, a measure has been taken to help protect those individuals whose e-mail addresses are listed inside from having thei r legitimate e-mail addresses discovered and automatically spammed. Basically, the text \"SPAM-ZAP\" (without quotation marks) will be inserted directly after the \"@\" symbol in each e-ma il address found in this report - an example of this format follows: steve.harmon@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov . Inserting this \"SPAM-ZAP\" text creates a bogus e-mail address that will cause any automatically generated SPAM e-mail to be sent to the bogus, invalid address instead of to the real e-mail address. Ultimately, any e-mail messages that are sent to that bogus address w ill not make it through to the intended recipient - this is true of both legitimate messages as well as SPAM. Instructions for readers who wish to e-mail a contributor to this report: 1) Click on the desired e-mail address or copy th e address into a new message inside your e-mail client. 2) Remove the capitalized words \"SPAM-ZAP\" (t here will be no quotation marks) from the e- mail address. 3) Write your message and send it out as you normally would. Thank you for your understanding of this issue a nd for your willingness to work with any minor inconveniences associated with our use of this anti-spam method. We hope that readers will support our efforts towards eliminating this doc ument as an inadvertent source of e-mail addresses that could be used by spammers, while still providing a means by which to contact individual contributors to this report. S i n c e r e l y , Marianne DuBois and Susan Davies Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 8 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report CHAPTER 1 PREFACE Contact: Susan Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207) 287-7778 email: Susan.p.davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The following report is submitted to simultaneously fulfill requirements of the Clean Water Act (CWA) particularly the Section 305(b) Report, Section 303(d) List, and information requested under Section 314, and, also to serve as a biennial report to the Maine Legislature as required under 38 MRSA Section 464.3.A. The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (The Department or MDEP) assembles these reports with input from many sources and recognizes that the Section 305(b) Report and Section 303(d) List are important ways of regularly communicating information on the health, current status and trends of the State's waters. For the 2008 Integrated Report the Department has updated tabular summaries of water quality status (Appendices; Chapter 4 and Chapter 8) that appeared in the 2006 Integrated Report but reduced narrative content. Programmatic descriptions and summaries are greatly reduced unless a major programmatic change has occurred since the 2006 Integrated Report. For background information about specific water quality programs please refer to the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Report, available on the web at: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Maine waterbodies are assigned to one of five categories (or sub-categories) that describe water quality status in the Integrated Report (Executive Summary, page 10 and Ch 4). Those waters that are currently listed under category 5 represent U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) \u00a7303d list \"impaired waters\" and require development and submission of Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) report to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The 2008 Integrated Report provides: Delineation of water quality assessment units (AUs), identified by their 10-digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) followed by a waterbody-specific code (Appendices II-IV); Water quality attainment status for every Assessment Unit (Appendices II-IV); Progress toward achieving comprehensive assessment of all waters (Chapter 4), Basis for the water quality standard attainment determinations for each Assessment Unit (Chapter 4 and Appendices); Schedules for additional monitoring planned for certain Assessment Units (Appendices II-IV); Identification of Assessment Units requiring Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determinations and a schedule (priority) for those waters (Chapter 8 and Appendices II-IV); The 2008 Integrated Report presents State of Maine water quality assessment summaries for rivers, streams and lakes that have been generated by the Assessment Database (ADB). ADB is public domai n software developed by EPA to improve states' ability to track and document water quality assessment results. Though marine assessment data and information is not currently stored in Maine's Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 9 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report ADB assessment results are reported in the 2008 Appendices, as in previous versions of the Integrated Report. Data Sources and Acknowledgements SOURCES OF RIVER AND STREAM ASSESSMENT DATA The Department generates much of the data for the assessment through the various monitoring programs it conducts, notably the Biomonitoring Program, Surface Water Ambient Toxics Monitoring Program, the Diox in Monitoring Program, and the Atlantic Salmon Recovery Plan. Additionally, data is provided from a variety of professional and volunteer monitoring groups. These include other state agencies and resources (Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, Atlantic Salmon Commission, Department of Health and Human Services, University of Maine System), federal agencies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, National Park Service), other governmental agencies (Saco River Corridor Commission, St. Croix International Waterway Commission), tribes (Penobscot Indian Nation, Houlton Band of Maliseets) and a number of volunteer watershed groups / conservation organizations that are working cooperatively with Department staff and that follow an EPA approved Quality Assurance Project Plan or that follow monitoring practices specifically approved by MDEP (Watershed c ouncils of the Dennys, Narraguagus, Ducktrap and Sheepscot Rivers, Presumpscot River Watch, Royal River Conservation Trust, Sheepscot Valley Conservation Association, The Nature Conservancy). SOURCES OF LAKE ASSESSMENT DATA The Department's Lake Assessment Section manages much of the data collected from lakes within the state. A strong partnership with the Maine Volunteer Lakes Monitoring Program (VLMP, Inc.) assures the quality and comparability of the data collected through numerous regional entities and local lake associations. Regional entities include Cobbossee Watershed District, Lakes Environmental Association, St. Croix International Waterway Commission, Allagash Wilderness Waterway, Penobscot Indian Nation, Portland Water District, Auburn Water District, Acadia National Park, and Rangeley Lakes Heritage Trust. Data has also been acquired from private consultants (such as Lake and Watershed Resource Management Assoc., Biodiversity Research Institute, Florida Power and Light as part of regulatory requirements) and water utilities that belong to the Maine Water Utility Association. Additional data is acquired through the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife (DIF&W) and through cooperative projects with the University of Maine System, Colby College, Unity College, Soil and Water Conservation Districts and similar entities. Future lake assessments will include evaluation of data collected under probability based studies conducted within EPA Region I and as part of the National Lake Assessment Study being conducted by EPA Headquarters. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 10 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report SOURCES OF MARINE ASSESSMENT DATA The Maine Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Marine Resources (DMR), the Casco Bay Estuary Project (CBEP) and a variety of volunteer monitoring groups monitor Maine's coastal waters. DMR monitors for indicators of human pathogens (fecal coliforms) and biotoxins (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning). The purpose of the DMR monitoring is to protect human health by managing shellfish harvest areas. DEP monitors toxic contaminants in tissues and assesses water quality using data collected by DEP, especially the Surface Water Ambient Toxics program, and others. DEP participates in the Gulf of Maine Council's Gulfwatch Project that surveys toxic contamination in mussel tissue in the Gulf of Maine. Friends of Casco Bay monitors water quality in Casco Bay. The Casco Bay Estuary Project (CBEP), funded by EPA's National Estuary Program, also monitors and supports monitoring in Casco Bay and coordinates the National Coastal Assessment for the entire Maine coast. SOURCES OF WETLANDS ASSESSMENT DATA The Department generates most of its assessment data for wetlands through the Biological Monitoring Program (see Chapter 5 for additional information). Wetland biomonitoring is coordinated with the State's river and stream biomonitoring program using a 5-year rotating basin schedule. Although DEP does not currently report attainment status for wetlands, the Biomonitoring Program is working to clarify how existing water quality standards apply to wetlands, and is also developing wetland-specific biological criteria. This will enable the Department to report wetland attainment status in future years. Data for permitted wetland gains and losses is provided through the DEP Wetland Loss Tracking System by the Division of Land Resource Regulation. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 11 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report CHAPTER 2 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RESPONSE TO COMMENTS Executive Summary SURFACE WATERS This report continues to base assessments of streams & rivers, lakes & ponds, and marine & estuarine waters on the five main listing categories that were initially established for these waters in the 2002 305b Report. These five main assessment categories are as follows: Category 1: Attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. Category 2: Attains some of the designated uses; no use is threatened; and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). Category 3: Insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). Category 4: Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but does not require development of a TMDL (Total Maximum Daily Load) report. Category 5: Waters impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), and a TMDL report is required. Section 4-1 on Assessment Methodology contains more detailed information on the listing categories and sub-categories. The results from the 2002 through 2008 Integrated Reports are not exactly comparable but they can give an idea of changes in the approximate amounts of waters in each category. This information is displayed in Table 2-1. Table 2-1 indicates that there has been little change since the close of the last reporting period for rivers and streams. An error was corrected in reach length for a mainstem river segment so Total Miles Assessed has decreased since the 2006 report. Small increases in Category 2 waters occurred due to new data that confirmed that certain segments are now attaining some uses. Confirmed attainment of standards or Completion of Total Maximum Daily Loads caused a decrease in 17 miles of Category 5 with an increase in Category 2 and 4 rivers and streams. This table also reveals that the lakes and ponds of Maine were relatively stable (as a percent of total assessed waters) with respect to their listing categories during the 2006 to 2008 time frame. This period saw reductions in categories 3 and 5a and an increase in category 2 and 4a waters. For marine and estuarine waters the 2008 Report relies on the same assessment data as that used to report on status in 2006.

The DEP deems that the CSO Master Plans and associated enforcement controls provide fully adequate mechanisms for control of this cause of bacterial impairment and thus they are a low priority for Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development. All freshwaters in Maine are listed for an impaired Fish Consumption Use caused by mercury from sources beyond the region; Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 13 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report miles affected by this statewide listing are not recorded in Table 2-1. These waters were listed in Sub-Category 5C in the 2006 Integrated Report. These waters have now been moved to Category 4A because of US EPA's approval, on December 20, 2007, of a Regional Mercury Total Maximum Daily Load. The New England States and New York developed the regional mercury TMDL to address mercury impairments that are caused by sources beyond the Region. The State of Maine has already taken aggressive action to reduce sources of mercury within the State's jurisdiction. Further mercury reductions will be required from sources outside the State's boundaries to provide the desired reduction of mercury in Maine's waters. Category 5D, Legacy Pollutants, includes many mainstem river segments that are listed for non-attainment of the Fish Consumption use due to PCBs in fish tissue. WETLANDS Maine DEP began development of a biological monitoring and assessment program for freshwater wetlands in 1998 as part of the biomonitoring program. The Biological Monitoring Program provides water quality information for a wide array of programs, and includes ambient monitoring, evaluation of water quality classification attainment, and assessment of risks and impacts. The wetlands initiative currently focuses on aquatic macroinvertebrates as indicators of wetland ecological integrity, and plans to build capacity to assess multiple biological assemblages including algae (needed for development of nutrient criteria) and plant communities. Key wetland related activities include (1) ambient monitoring and assessment of wetland condition, (2) development of biological criteria for wetlands, (3) inclusion of wetlands in comprehensive State water quality monitoring strategy, (4) development of Internet Mapping Project to provide public access to biomonitoring data, and (5) development of landscape-level assessment tool to predict threats to wetlands. Starting September 1, 2007, significant vernal pool habitat is protected by law under the State of Maine Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA). For more information, see Chapter 5, Wetlands or visit the DEP's NRPA page at: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/nrpapage.htm . GROUND WATER The Groundwater Program is described in chapter 6. Responsibility for ground water resource assessment and protection is shared among the Department of Environmental Protection, the Department of Health and Human Services' Division of Environmental Health, the Maine Geological Survey in the Department of Conservation and the U. S. Geological Survey. Several other agencies, particularly the Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, and State Planning Office may investigate ground water contamination problems in certain areas and they also contribute to ground water protection through development of ordinances and management practices that are designed to reduce the risk of harming ground water quality. A significant portion of Maine's ground water may be threatened by contamination, particularly in unforested areas, which comprise approximately 11% of the State. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 14 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Drinking water quality is an issue that carries significant public concern for both private and public well supplies. Public interest in ground water is primarily focused on its use as a drinking water supply (ground water provides 60% of all human demand and 75% of livestock demand statewide) and on its us e as a source of process water for industry. Numerous wells in Maine have been made unpotable by pollution from specific point sources and also from nonpoint source pollution. Important sources of ground water contamination in Maine include disposal activities such as septic systems and landfills, leaking storage faci lities, agriculture, spilled hazardous materials or previously unregulated activities. Monitoring of ground water in Maine is either site-specific or generalized. Monitoring at a particular site is typically done to gather data on water quality impacts of particular activities, and may or may not be research-related. Most of the ground water data collected in Maine is the result of permit conditions, enforcement agreements or impact assessments. With the advent of the Environmental Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD) at the DEP, many of these data which are potentially useful for research purposes are now readily made available to the public or other agencies in report or map form. This effort enhances the ability of the DEP to communicate and report groundwater and other data to the EPA and other state or federal agencies. Ambient monitoring refers to large area, long-term monitoring conducted to obtain trend information on ground water quality or quantity. The MGS and the USGS carry out these types of monitoring projects under several cooperative agreements. The USGS and MGS maintain a statewide network of ground water observation wells to track changes in water quality and quantity. For the purpose of this report, data derived from the DHHS Public Water Supply Monitoring Program are used as ambient ground water quality data. These water tests are from single-source untreated public water supply wells. Major impediments to effective ground water protection in Maine include; the lack of data to quantify the impact of some nonpoint pollution sources and general public unfamiliarity with key groundwater concepts and issues. Public misconception about groundwater is probably the major factor contributing to degradation of this resource. The development of a comprehensive and accessible database for water data (EGAD) has increased the accessibility of the wide variety of data collected on water quality by various state agencies. Continuing use of this database will improve operations at the agencies responsible for groundwater protection and assessment, and provide a resource for increasing the general public's awareness of groundwater issues. Relative to groundwater protection the principal uses of this database are to (1) help design clean-up strategies in areas of known contamination; (2) plan future development that better provides for protection of public health and safety; (3) assist in prioritizing protection of sensitive ground water and surface water bodies, wetlands, and other resources; (4) enhance understanding of the spatial relationships between water resources and population as they relate to potential or known pollution sources; and (5) assess the flow and transport interrelationships between surface and ground water quality, in order to evaluate groundwater impacts on surface water bodies and on groundwater-dependent habitat. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 15 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Response to Comments PROCESS TO SOLICIT PUBLIC COMMENTS The following subsections detail the actions taken by the Department of Environmental Protection to promote the public's knowledge of the existence and availability of the draft version of the 2008 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report (commonly known as the 305b Report). This process was undertaken in order to gain comments from the public on the contents and conclusions of the draft report. The official period of time that the Report was available for public comment was from March 10, 2008 to the close of business on March 31, 2008. In addition to the public comment process outlined below, the draft version of the 2008 305b Report was reviewed internally by Department staff as well as by US EPA staff in order to produce the final version of the Report. REPORT POSTING ON THE DEPARTMENT 'S WEBSITE : On March 10, 2008 the Department posted the draft 2008 305b Report as two digital files in the Adobe\u00ae Portable Document Format (PDF) on the public comments section of its Bureau of Land and Water Quality website. Hardcopies of the draft report are made available to the public on request. POSTAL MAILING TO THE AGENCY RULEMAKING SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE LIST: The Department offers a subscription service that provides notification of both rulemaking changes and rule adoption for all department rules. Subscribers to this service include both individual citizens and r epresentatives of organizations that wish to be contacted when the DEP releases rulemaking information. During the week of March 10, 2008 the Department mailed out approximately 150 letters to people and entities on the Agency Rulemaking Subscription Service List, including all other natural resource agencies within state government. The text of that letter follows and is italicized in order to differentiate it from other text contained in this Report.

Davies Maine Department of Environmental Protection Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 17 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report State House #17 Augusta, ME 04333 PRESS RELEASE : On March 10, 2008 the Department of Environmental Protection issued a press release designed to inform the public of the availability of the draft 2008 305b Report. This release also described how the DEP was seeking public comment on water quality listings in the Report. Between fifteen and eighteen radio, television and print outlets around the state received the press release and it was also linked to a news headline on the Department's homepage. The release also went to the Associated Press, which places the release on its \"wire\" for other media outlets to run, if they so choose. The text of that press release follows and is italicized in order to differentiate it from other text contained in this Report. DEP Seeks Comment on Water Quality (AUGUSTA)\u2014The Maine Department of Environmen tal Protection (DEP) wants feedback on its latest review of the health of Maine's lakes, st reams, rivers, estuaries and coastal waters. Once the review receives final Environmental Protection Agency approval, the water quality ratings in the 2008 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report help to determine planning and funding priorities for water quality improvements . The DEP is asking the public to comment on the draft report now posted on the web: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/draft.htm Comments become part of the public record and are printed in the final version of the report. The comment deadline is 5:00 PM, March 31, 2008. \"Feedback from the public on the accuracy of our eva luations is important to this process\", says Dr. David Courtemanch, director of the DEP's Division of Environmental Assessment. \"These assessments drive decisions as to how particular public waters will be managed into the future, that's why we encourage citizens to review the ratings.\" The report, also known as the \"305b Report\", a re quirement of the federal Clean Water Act, is a water quality snapshot. Prepared every two years, the public can look back to see if and how the assessment of their favorite lake or stream has changed. One section lists waters considered to be \"impaired\" due to problems that affect one or more officially assigned \"uses\" of the waterbody, such as 'Recreation' or 'Fishing'. \"An 'impaired' listing can set into motion specific management activities designed to bring a water body back into full-use co mpliance,\" notes Courtemanch. \"Those activities can range from more vigilant monitoring to complete abatement of a pollutant.\" The 2008 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring a nd Assessment Report is based on information gathered by the DEP along with other state, federal, tribal, local agencies, non-government organizations and volunteer monitoring groups. DEP analyzes the data to assess the capacity of Maine waters to support drinking, fishing, recreation (such as swimming) and their ability to sustain aquatic life as defined in Maine's wat er classification laws. The report also provides extensive information on the status of Maine's groundwater and wetland resources. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 18 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report SUMMARY OF PUBLIC COMMENTS AND RESPONSES The Department received public comment s from the parties listed below. Issues raised by comments from these or ganizations or individuals are either quoted or paraphrased and are presented in italic typeface. The DEP response to that comment follows the comment and summarizes any actions taken by the Department in response to the comment. If the text does not indicate that any changes were made to the Draft Integrated Report, then none were made. POLLUTION IN THE PENOBSCOT RIVER Paraphrased Comments from: Bernard Madden, resident of Millinocket, Maine Stormwater runoff is a major water quality problem. I observe it du ring the spring runoff when Millinocket Stream turns brown. If an individual dumped this amount of pollution into one of Maine's rivers they would be a rrested. Our government should take action to prevent stormwater from running off into our ri vers. It eventually gets into the ocean and could disrupt the ecological balance th ere and jeopardize important human food supplies. The State's effort at Atlantic sa lmon restoration is inade quate. The Department should be more proactive and urge lawmake rs to tighten the standards for municipal discharges. MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that stormwater is a major water quality problem. The Maine Stormwater Program within t he Bureau of Land and Water Quality includes the regulation of stormwater under three core laws: The Site Location of Development law (Site Law ), Stormwater Management Law, and Waste Discharge Law (MEPDES). Aspects of stormwater are also addressed under industry specific laws such as the borrow pit and solid waste laws, and the rules administered by the Land Use Regulation Commission. Detailed information about the array of MDEP programs designed to minimize the negative effe cts of stormwater runoff may be found at : http://www.maine.gov/dep/bl wq/docstand/stormwater/ Millinocket Stream is on the 303d list due to impairment of the primary and secondary contact recreation uses due to bacteria (3 miles) and stormwater runoff is a major contribut ing cause of the impairment. A Total Maximum Daily Load report is scheduled for 2008. PLUM CREEK Paraphrased Comments from: Mr. James Lavertu, lawyer pr acticing in Madawaska, Maine Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 19 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report I am concerned that southern Maine is opposing development in northern Maine; in particular I am concerned with the wide spread southern Maine opposition to Plum Creek. Plum Creek and the extension of Interstate 95 through the northern tip of Maine could bring some measure of prosperity to the Millinocket are a. MDEP should totally ignore anti-development attitudes when applied to Northern Maine, especially if they come from other parts of Maine. MDEP Response: MDEP reviews proposals and applications for development to ensure that all State and federal environmental laws and regulations are met and will continue to be met for any projects t hat go forward. MDEP does not take a position on development in norther n Maine but rather reviews each application on its own merit. MDEP supports the public's right to appropriately express opinions during the Public Review Process. Water Quality Concerns from Overboard Discharges (OBDs) in Sheepscot River, Cross Point to Route 1 Bridge, Edgecomb Paraphrased Comments from: Byron Johnson, Edgecomb, Maine 1. At the time of the latest report availabl e to me (May 2007), there were 27 licensed overboard discharges (OBDs) in Edgecomb, of which 26 are on the Sheepscot (one mistakenly attributed to \"Wiscasset Harbor\") and one on the Cross River (understood from the owner be in the process of abatemen t). Clamming is prohibited in this portion of the Sheepscot (Pollution Closed Area 22 A.(1)) \"because of pollution.\" Note: Commenter Johnson next inserted text from what he reported was a \"typical OBD permit\", including comments from the Department of Marine Resources noting closure of a shellfish harvesting area due to OBDs, and language from the Department of Environmental Protection that concludes: \"Under Maine's water classification standard s, shellfish harvesting is a designated use of all estuarine and marine waters of the State. The presence of overboard discharges prevents this waterbody from meeting its designated use for shellfish harvesting. C. Based on the preceding conclusions a nd in accordance with CMR 596, a waste discharge license cannot be issued. Th e Department must issue a conditional discharge permit when the renewal of an overboard discharge license is denied.\" MDEP Response: The Department's OBD Licensing and Removal Grant Programs exist because we agree with Mr. Johnson's basic premise. However, the cited permit language is outdated and predates Overboard discharges: licenses and abandonment 06-096 CMR 596(effective November 24, 2004) and the affected statutes. The curr ent language is more comprehensive and the findings differ according to the resu lts of the site evaluation, the water quality category at the location of the OBD, and the OBD inspection Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 20 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report compliance rating. Currently the Department is making both license and removal grant decisions based on the OB Ds present in the given closure area, the feasibility of replacing t he OBDs, the water quality category at that site and the potential to open shellfish areas. From a water quality standards perspecti ve, the closure is administrative- based and precautionary due to proximit y to a wastewater outfall. MDEP does not have data documentin g the presence of criteria violations. The purpose of the Integrated Report is to report water-quality based conditions and impairments. Regulat ory policies and requirements that might prohibit an activity are not cons idered impairments (just as a closed fishing season does not mean a water body is impaired for the designated use of fishing). 2. On Davis Island there are 5 OBDs. Connec tions for water and sewer have recently been installed across the Sheepscot, from Wi scasett, eliminating the formerly largest OBD. Development including sanitary sewers ha s been started within 200 feet of the nearest site having an OBD (the re are two more OBD sites within 300 feet of the first OBD site, and another at about 200 feet furthe r). There are complaints of quantity and quality problems with water wells in the vi cinity. The owners of three Davis Island OBD sites have a recorded agreement with the deve loper wherein he agrees to not allow utility connections via the shortest distance(!) MDEP Response: OBDs which pass more than 75% of the inspections in the previous five- year period may be licensed. The Depar tment inspects these facilities twice yearly and will not relicense the OBD until a scheduled plan of compliance is submitted for any OBD which passes less than 75% of the inspections. MDEP shares Mr. Johnson's concern and is pursuing enforcement action against repeat vi olators, especially with regard to disinfection. A scheduled plan of compliance is required. The Department can only compel owners of facilities which abut a municipal sewer to connect. If the sewer is priv ate, or there is a privately-owned parcel between the OBD facility and t he sewer, and the facility owner holds no right, title or in terest to that parcel, we cannot compel, but can only encourage people to gain the nece ssary easements to connect. The developer's side agreem ent may or may not have any legal standing depending on the above. The Department would need more information. Regarding water well complaints, t he Integrated Report does not assess and report on groundwater quality in the re port except in a general way. While OBDs will not cause a quantity problem, the comm enter provides insufficient information about the nature of the \"wellwater quality\" issues for the MDEP to make any comments. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 21 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report 3. There are clusters of OBDs: Eddy Road/Clifford Road, Shore Road, and Cross Point Road. Additional OBDs are scattered. In one or more cases there is land in the same ownership that could be used for individual or collective on-land di sposal (probably with pumping). Isolated sites might lend themselves to altern ative black-water disposal systems (with little or no water added to the waste, reducing water consumption). [example: \"EcoJohn\" (www.ecojohn.com), perhaps more common in the states of Washington and Oregon]. I w ould urge that the annual in spection program consider changes in site context and \"Best Practicable Tr eatment(s)\" that w ould directly address factors preventing attainment of adopted water qualit y goals, particularly where permitees actively frustrate full compliance. MDEP Response: The Department agrees. Since S eptember 13, 2003, OBD owners have been required to hire a Licensed Si te Evaluator (LSE) to determine whether there is a technologically f easible replacement for existing OBD systems, prior to transfer of the property or license renewal, if one has not been done in the five years previous. If the property is being transferred (sale, inheritance, gift, trust, etc.) the parties to the sale must install the replacement within 90 days [38 MRSA \u00a7413 (3)]. We will continue to renew licenses to the original licens ees until such time as the Department offers grant money for the re moval [38 MRSA \u00a7414-A(1-B)(A)]. Subsurface systems are subject to appr oval by the Dept of Health and Human Services' Division of Environment al Health pursuant to the Maine Subsurface Waste Water Disposal Rules, 10-144 CMR 241. They can allow alternative systems, but re quire that a full-system design be submitted concurrently. Most peo ple will install the full system. OBD #w002323 in Edgecomb was removed last year pursuant to 38 MRSA \u00a7413 (3). 4. If the water is not safe for clams I suspect it is not safe for human body contact! MDEP Response: We agree, and we hold that this is why the DMR closure areas, the OBD licensing program, and the OBD removal grant programs exist. MDEP appreciates Mr. Johnson's concerns and his recognition of the importance of the OBD program. MD EP is requiring new site evaluations prior to license renewal and/or property transfer and expediting whatever removals the law and Department resour ces allows, in order to protect shellfishing and recreational uses, improve the water quality and reopen shellfishing areas. 5. Your \"Category 2: Estuarine and Marine Waters Attaining Some Designated Uses - Insufficient Information for Other Uses \" comments on Waterbody ID 730-4 Sheepscot River (that there are) OBDs, detrimental to a designated use. The vast majority of OBDs are in either Category 2 or Category 5B-1 waters. Waterbody 730-4 is listed in Ca tegory 2 since data on all uses is incomplete, however for those uses measured it is in attainment. The Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 22 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report presence of the OBDs does not necessar ily cause a violation of water quality standards. Category 5B-1 wate rs usually have other sources of bacteria besides OBDs including t he presence of sewage tereatment plants, boats, nonpoint source elev ated fecals, etc. For example Wiscasset Wastewater Treatment Plant outfall (0.62 million gallons per day), the FPL outfalls, and the Wiscasse t snowdump are all located in the vicinity of the Route #1 bridge, upriver from Edgecomb. FISHING IN MAINE Paraphrased Comments: Pam Letalien, Maine citizen Maine people should be able to safely eat fi sh in Maine's lakes and rivers. Not long ago we were cautioned to only eat small amounts of wild-caught fish (due to contamination). It seems incompatible to be promoting Maine lakes as a great vacation spot when you can't eat the fish. We could ruin our reputation as vacationland. MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that contami nation of fish tissue from human-generated toxicants is a serious problem. MDEP monitors lakes, rivers and streams and marine waters for evidence of toxi c levels of contaminants in fish and shellfish tissue through the Surfac e Waters Ambient Toxics Program (SWAT) and through the Dioxin Monito ring Program and reports findings to the Legislature. This past year Maine has been part of a regional Total Maximum Daily Load analysis that has set targets for regional reduction of mercury. Maine has already impl emented significant reductions in mercury sources, however, larger sources lie outside our boundaries and will be controlled through these regiona l strategies. This report also delists certain waters previously impaired by dioxin because of progress made in removing this contaminant from some industrial processes. Detailed information about the SWAT Program may be found at: http://www.maine.gov/dep/bl wq/docmonitoring/swat/ Detailed information about the Dioxin Monitoring Program may be found at: http://www.maine.gov/dep/bl wq/docmonitoring/dioxin/ GENERAL RIVER AND STREAM WATER QUALITY Paraphrased Comments: Joan Bowles, Benton, Maine As a concerned citizen I woul d like to share that I feel the water quality is a very important investment in Maine. I live along the Kennebec a nd I personally do not concur that the quality is a B for a river. I would not swim, fish or have my dog drink the water. I hope that our water supply is one ar ea that money is appropriated for. MDEP Response: Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 23 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Standards for both Class B and C are more stringent than Clean Water Act standards and are quite suitable for swimming and fishing. A portion of the Kennebec River between the Fairfield-Skowhegan boundary and the confluence with Messalonskee St ream is Class C (Benton area). Some of the Class B portions of the Kennebec do not attain all the standards of Class B, mostly due to bacteria from combined sewer overflows, and legacy effects of some pollutants (e.g. PCBs), but Class B has been deemed by MDEP and the Ma ine State Legislature to be an attainable goal condition for those sect ions. The MDEP is working to bring all sections of the river into co mpliance with its classification. REPORT FORMAT AND LISTING CONCERNS Paraphrased Comment: Nick Bennett, Natural Resources Council of Maine 1. The Maine DEP Integrated Report is diffic ult to follow and not very useful to the public. MDEP should produce a simpler version of the report. MDEP Response: We agree that the Integrated Report (IR) format is cumbersome and that a simpler version is desirable. MDEP follows the Integrated Report format established by the US EPA. 2. MDEP incorrectly implies that the bleach ing process used in Maine's kraft pulp mills \"eliminates dioxin\". This is untrue. Chlorine dioxide bleaching has been documented to leave signific ant residual and the process is not \"chlorine-free\". Residual chlorine produces dioxins and MD EP should not state that \"Maine kraft mills have eliminated dioxin discharges\". MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that absolute elimination of the production of dioxin secondary to the bleaching process has probably not been accomplished and is impossible to measure. Re sults of DEP's Above/Below test documented (by 2004 for 4 of 5 bleached kraft pulp and paper mills, and by 2005 for the last mill) that there was no measurable difference in dioxin concentrations in fish above and below each mill. If a small unmeasurable discharge is still occurring, it is not significant with respect to bioaccumulation in fish compared to the MCDC's Fish Tissue Action Level. We have modified the language to reflect the finding that there is no measurable discharge. 3. The \"above/below\" test is fatally flawed as described in detail in the January 13, 2005 letter to Commissioner Dawn Gallagher from members of the Surface Water Ambient Toxics Technical Advisory Group). It is untrue that \"new sources of dioxin have been removed. MDEP Response: MDEP disagrees that the above/below test is fatally flawed. While it is not as precise as NRCM may prefer, it provides a reasonable test with Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 24 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report statistical confidence as required in the dioxin law and within the resources of the Departm ent to conduct. Methods and results of the test are reviewed and approved by a techni cal advisory committee. Despite the arguments made in the January 13, 2005 letter, MDEP holds that the mills would have passed the Above/Belo w test within a year, even if the test had been as suggested in the letter. 4. The \"Expected to Attain\" date of 2020, by rivers are supposed to be free of dioxin, has no basis. MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that the date of 2020 by which certain segments will be free from dioxin\" does not have a scientifi c basis. US EPA requires that MDEP provide an \"Expected to attain\" date for all Category 4B listings. The date of 2020 represents MDEP's best estima te of when certain segments will be free from dioxin. Based on past experience with toxics monitoring, and in the absence of scientific data on fish tissue recovery rates for various species of fish in Maine, 2020 represents a time beyond the next several 303d reporting cycles, and MDEP does not judge that these segments will be free of dioxin before that date. Monitoring and assessment of dioxin levels will continue. 5. The Category 2 listing for the Androscoggin River at Livermore Falls is confusing. Why is that im poundment not listed for algae blooms in the same way that Gulf Island Pond is listed? MDEP Response: There is no documentation of any al gae blooms in the Livermore Falls impoundment. This segment was listed for non-attainment of aquatic life and it now attains applicable aqua tic life uses of Class C. 6. The Penobscot River listing is confusi ng. Why does MDEP state that more monitoring data is needed when the river is obviously not attaining for dissolved oxygen and nutrients? MDEP Response: MDEP agrees that certain Penobsco t River segments are impaired and they are listed in Category 5A for non- attainment of aquatic life uses due to dissolved oxygen and excess nutrients. Additi onal monitoring data is needed to determine the best restoration actions to address the impairments. 7. Why is the TMDL completion date for the Penobscot River 2009? Why is MDEP waiting until 2009 to complete the TMDL? MDEP Response: The TMDL is currently in progre ss. 2009 is a reasonable target completion date; though it is possible it will be completed prior to 2009. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 25 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report ACIDIFICATION OF MARINE WATERS Center for Biological Diversity, San Francisco, CA Paraphrased comment: Maine should include all of its marine waters on the 303(d) List of Impaired waters (Category 5) as a result of past, ongoing and projected absorption of anthr opogenic carbon dioxide pollution. Maine's pH standard is inade quate to protect life in marine waters. MDEP Response: The Maine DEP disagrees that a listing of its marine waters as impaired for pH due to ocean acidification is appropriate at this time. The evidence for ocean acidification does not fall within the State's listing methodology or indicate factual impairment of Maine's water quality standards has occurred, or that Maine's marine waters are threatened with an impairment within the listing cycle. While the Maine DEP agrees that ocean acidification is an issue of growing long-term and global concern, and something to be followed in years ahead, a listing according to CWA 303(d) would not be appropriate for the following reasons: There has been no detected impairment of any designated use or characteristic of any classified coastal water in Maine's jurisdiction due to pH. CBD provides no documentation of impairment for Maine waters. While an inference of water quality change might be used to determine our waters are \"threatened\", there is no evidence presented that any impairment will occur within the next 2 year listing cycle. The rate of change shown from the literature would not cause a violation of Maine's pH criteria for many decades. Ocean acidification is an issue of global scope, however, information from one area cannot be readily extrapolated to another. The information provided by CBD comes from areas outside of Maine's jurisdictional waters, and mostly from areas quite remote from Maine. Following review of the extensive list of refe rences provided by CBD, Maine DEP did not find any of the references refer to information collected in Maine, the Gulf of Maine, or northwestern Atlantic waters. While the mechanisms of ocean acidification may be similar, the effects in different ecosystems will vary. Nearshore waters may be less affected than offshore waters due to land export of buffering substances. A 303(d) listing is an inappropriate tool to manage the issue. 303(d) listings put a state on a course of developing TMDLs. Maine has neither the information, resources, nor jurisdictional authority to address the causes and sources attributed to ocean acidification The Maine DEP considers that a 303(d) listing could prevent the ocean acidification issue from gaining appropriate national/global attention by inferring that it is an issue of the coastal states that can be addressed through TMDLs. Even if this were the case, the result would be a patchwork of strategies of differing purpose, effect, and efficacy that could defeat the intent of reversing ocean acidification. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 26 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine's pH criteria for estuarine and marine waters (7.0-8.5) were established in the 1970s and have been approved by USEPA. This Integrated Report does not review adequacy of criteria. That process is left to the State's triennial review (38\u00a7464.2). If evidence is shown that Maine's pH standard is inadequate to protect designated uses and characteristics of its waters, the criteria would need to be changed in the statute. TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD (TMDL) REPORT TARGET DATES Paraphrased Comment: MDEP Internal Staff comments Several dates in the posted Draft 2008 In tegrated Report Append ices should be changed to more accurately refl ect the likely completion date.

Please refer to the 2006 Report for background information on methods used to compile the State of Maine Water Atlas. (http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm ) The State of Maine has a total surface area of over 35,000 square miles, the most in New England; with dry land occupying almost 31,000 square miles and the larger surface waters occupying about 4,500 square miles. With a population of about 1.3 million people, Maine also is the least densely populated state in New England. However, since most of the population is concentrated in the southern and coastal portions of the State and into bands on both sides of Interstate 95, regional population densities may vary considerably from the state's average population density. Maine's 5,780 lakes and ponds cover 986,508 acres, an area that is somewhat larger than the State of Rhode Island. There are over 7,000 perennial brooks, streams and rivers in Maine, ranging in length from less than two miles to nearly 200 miles, with an estimated total length of 31,227 miles. The current version of the Geographic Info rmation System (GIS) boundary data layer indicates a value of 5,261 miles of coastline. As with many of the other data sets, this value differs slightly from earlier reports due to advances in GIS technology and reporting accuracy. Although there are no definitive inventories of inland and coastal wetlands and marshes in Maine, this year's atlas estimated a total wetland area of almost 3,200,000 acres. This conservative estimate does not include over 7,500 known wetlands of less than 3 acres. Also noteworthy is that at least 1,281 square miles of the state are underlain by significant sand and gravel aquifers (up from 1,241 square miles as reported in 2004).

Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 30 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report WATER QUALITY STANDARDS PROGRAM Contact: Susan P. Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Tel: (207) 287-3901 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/classification/index.htm The water quality of Maine is described in terms of physical, chemical and biological characteristics associated with the state's water classification program. As established in Maine statute (38 MRSA Sections 464-470), the classification program consists of designated uses (e.g. drinking water supply, recreation in and on the water, habitat for fish and other aquatic life), criteria (e.g. bacteria, dissolved oxygen and aquatic life), and characteristics (e.g. natural, free flowing) that specify levels of water quality necessary to maintain the designated uses. All State waters have a classification assignment (Lakes: GPA. Rivers and streams: AA, A, B, C. Marine and estuarine: SA, SB, SC). The classification program is reviewed every three years by the Department and the Board of Environmental Protection (Board). The Department will initiate the next round of water classification reviews in 2008. The Board may, after opportunity for public review and hearing, make recommendations to the Legislature for changes in standards or reclassification of selected waters. Highlights for Point Source Pollution Control Programs Contact: Brian Kavanah, DEP BLWQ, Division email: Brian.W.Kavanah@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/wastepage.htm Maine uses multiple approaches to ensure that point source discharges of wastewater receive adequate treatment prior to their release to waters of the State including: licensing, compliance inspections coupled with technical assistance in operations and maintenance, and enforcement where necessary. A number of financial assistance programs support new facility construction, elimination of discharges, as well as upgrades or additions to existing facilities. Highlights for 2006 - 2007 for these programs are summarized below or referenced by links to other documents. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE / POLLUTION PREVENTION PROGRAM Contact: Sterling Pierce, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Sterling.Pierce@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/engin.htm Department staffers participate in both industrial and municipal based technical assistance and pollution prevention projects. Highlight for 2006-2007 Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 31 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Technical Assistance was provided to the operators of the St. Agatha wastewater treatment facility. The facility had violated permit limits for two straight months after the operator resigned. Department staff members visited the facility, helped the new operators diagnose the problems and recommended solutions which brought the facility back into compliance. Department staff members conducted a follow-up visit during which the new operators worked with the staff to develop an operations and maintenance manual for the facility to help insure continued permit compliance. CONSTRUCTION OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITIES Contact: Steve McLaughlin, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Steve.A.Mclaughlin@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/grants.htm Clean State Revolving Fund and Maine Construction Grants Program: SRF program monies are used to provide low-interest loans (2% below market rates) to communities and sanitary districts to upgrade treatment facilities. The program depends on a yearly Federal Capitalization Grant which must be matched with a 20% State Grant. Construction grants help fund wastewater projects in communities where user charges are too high to borrow money. Between January 2006 and May 2007, the Maine DEP Construction Grants Program provided grants to 8 projects and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (SRF) funded 18 projects, some with assistance from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program grants/loans and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) grant money. These proj ects included new facilities, upgrades, additions, modifications, abatement of combined sewer overflows and refinancing for a total cost of approximately $216,098 in State grants and $23,411,441 in SRF loans. MAINE COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOW PROGRAM Contact: John True, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water John.N.True@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/doceng/csotech.htm Thirty-seven Maine communities are served by combined sewer systems, which convey a combination of sanitary and storm water flows to wastewater treatment facilities. During dry weather, all of the sewage in a combined system is conveyed to the treatment plant for adequate treatment. However, during rainstorms or snow-melt periods, stormwater mixes with the sanitary sewage, causing flows that exceed the capacity of the sewer system. This results in combined sewer overflows (CSOs), which vary extensively in pollutant types, concentrations and loads, as well as in volume of overflow and severity of impact to the receiving waterbodies. Maine has established an aggressive program, coordinated with EPA's CSO program, to assist Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 32 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report communities in evaluating the design, condition, activity, and effects of combined sewer systems and overflows. Highlights for 2006 Two of Maine's CSO communities, Fort Kent and Kittery, have completed their CSO abatement projects since the last Integrated Report and no longer have permitted CSO's.

Although state bond issues usually fund this grant program, in the past it has also received some funding directly from state appropriations. These funds have been used to assist municipalities with the construction of individual or cluster-type wastewater treatment systems that we re designed to eliminate heavily polluted discharges from either already malfunc tioning systems or non-existing system (\"straight pipes\"). This amount of funding has resulted in the construction of new wastewater treatment facilities in over 300 communities throughout the state. The total estimated value of the facilities built with Small Community Grants is approximately $28 million dollars. Currently, requests for assistance outweigh avai lable funding. Between 2006-2007, we disbursed grants in excess of $1.1 million dollars to 86 communities to replace 138 systems as detailed below. Table 3-3 provides a summary of information about the program on a year-by-year basis. Highlights 2006 - 2007 2006 - 72 systems were replaced removing 19,440 gallons of untreated discharges. 2007 - 66 systems were replaced removing 17,820 gallons of untreated discharges.

In Maine, the vast majority of wastewater discharge sources have previously been licensed. Therefore, the licensing program is focused largely upon renewal of existing licenses, rather than development of new licenses. Please refer to pages 32-33 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further discussion of Water Discharge Licensing Program. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm OVERBOARD DISCHARGE GRANT PROGRAM Contact: Tim MacMillan, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Tim.A.Macmillan@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docgrant/obdpara.htm As of December 31, 2007 Maine has 1,435 licensed overboard discharges (OBDs). OBDs are discharges of wastewater from individual homeowners or businesses to Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 34 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report surface waters (typically marine waters) where existing lots are unsuitable for subsurface disposal and no municipal system is available. OBDs typically lead to closures of shellfish growing and harvesting areas. In 1989 an OBD Removal Grant Program was established. The priorities of the grant program are to eliminate discharges that either causes the closure of shell fishing areas or that cause a public nuisance. Since the beginning of the program, approximately $6.3 million dollars have been spent in the process of removing 532 systems. The total acreage opened to shellfish harvesting since the start of the OBD Grant Program is over 17,000 acres. Acco rding to the DMR, opening and fully utilizing this much shellfish harvesting area has the potential to release a harvest with a retail value of over $4.4 million dollars annually. Highlight 2006 - 2007 A total of 90 OBD systems were removed in 2006-2007. The Maine Department of Marine Resources indicates that 345 acres of shellfish habitat were re-opened to shellfish harvesting in 2005-2006. (Table 3-4).

The compliance evaluation program involves on-site inspections of wastewater treatment facilities, occasional sampling of their effluent quality on a selective basis, and monthly evaluation of the licensees' self-monitoring reports. Discharge licenses also require immediate reporting of any major malfunctions, bypasses or exceedences of licens e limits to DEP inspectors. Highlight for 2006 - 2007 A new compliance initiative in 2006 and 2007 intensified the focus on inspections at wastewater treatment facilities. The Department staff have identified 5 inspection categories and developed more intensive inspection checklists to assist in the evaluation of these operational aspects. Department staff will focus on one of these categories each year of the 5-year permit cycle. The inspection categories are: process control, operations and maintenance, laboratory procedures, collection system, data management. This approach will create a more comprehensive evaluation of the facility each permit life cycle, giving a more balanced and thorough evaluation of the facility operations. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 36 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report ENFORCEMENT OF WATER QUALITY LAWS Contact: Dennis Merrill, DEP BLWQ, Division of Water email: Dennis.L.Merrill@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov philosophy of the DEP, BLWQ is to gain compliance and resolve problems at the least formal level that is appropriate, and to maximize the spirit of cooperation between the DEP and the regulated community. By fostering voluntary compliance with Maine's water pollution control laws, the overall effectiveness of the enforcement program is maximized and unnecessary litigation is avoided. Formal enforcement actions become necessary when violations of environmental laws are severe enough to warrant action regardless of the remediation effort, or when the violator is not responsive in preventing violations or refuses to cooperate with the DEP. Highlights for 2006 - 2007 A total of 23 water discharge enforcement formal cases were settled in 2006 and 2007. In addition to the penalties collected that provide a deterrent to violation of water quality laws and recover any economic benefit that may have been gained, the enforcement actions also included a variety of corrective actions that will improve water quality such as: upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities, elimination of discharges, environmental remediation, and three Supplemental Environmental Projects. Nature & Extent of Nonpoint Sources of Pollutants and Program Recommendations THE MAINE NPS WATER POLLUTION CONTROL PROGRAM Contact: Norm Marcotte, DEP Management Program (38 M.R.S.A. \u00a7410-I) helps restore and protect water resources from NPS pollution. The basic objective of the NPS program is to promote the use of state agency-defined \"best management practice guidelines\" (BMPs) to prevent water pollution. DEP administers the NPS program in coordination with state, federal, and local governments as well as non-government organizations. State agencies conduct programs that: (1) implement state laws or rules that require people to comply with performance standards governing certain land use activities to protect water quality; and (2) promote voluntary usage of best management practices. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 37 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine's BMP guidance manuals are available online: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/training/index.htm To help protect Maine's threatened waters and restore NPS impaired waters, DEP administers Maine's Nonpoint Source Management Program. DEP helps watershed groups assess water quality problems and take action to reduce or remove nonpoint sources of water pollution. In 2006 - 2007, there were more than 60 active projects funded, in part, by the NPS Grant Program. DEP receives federal funds under Section 319 of the Clean Water Act from EPA. Under the NPS Grant Program, DEP issued grants to local project sponsors who provide a minimum of a 40% match to the grant funds. These projects help communities improve watersheds to restore or protect lakes, streams, or coastal waters that are impaired or considered threatened. DEP also uses 319 funding for other programs designed to identify, prevent or reduce NPS water pollution problems. Staff provides technical assistance to local watershed groups and run education and outreach programs for a variety of target audiences - developers, building contractors, municipal officials, lakeshore landowners, teachers and the general public. Funds support assessment work, such as the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program, St reamTeams and stream sampling for benthic macro-invertebrates. Funds are used to develop Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) assessment reports for waters impair ed primarily by NPS pollution. The 2006 NPS Management Program Annual Report (May 2007) and the 2007 NPS Management Program Annual Report (April 2008) summarize the highlights and accomplishments of DEP's Nonpoint Source Program activities.

Changes that occurred in 2005 can be read on page 40 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report Related Website: http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm The changes in 2006 included the following: Developed Area: Narrowed the definition of developed area to no longer include areas that are changed from forest to meadow. This allows a project (such as an airport) to clear trees and still qualify under Permit by Rule as long as they keep the area in natural vegetation mowed no more than once per year. Linear Project : Changed definition of a \"linear project\" to \"linear portion of a project\" so that the term matches its usage in the rule, and allows subdivision roads to fall under the definition so that reduced, but still appropri ate, treatment standards will apply to them. BMP Standards : Dropped the term \"BMP standards\" due to confusion over multiple meanings (regulatory and non-regulatory) of t he term. Those standards are referred to as \"general standards\" in the rule. General Standards - required treatment area : Added flexibility to general standards so that treatment of impervious area can be redu ced from 95% of the impervious area to 90%, provided that overall treatment on the site will remain equivalent. Wetpond requirements : Revised the technical requirements for use of a wet pond under the general standards section. Redevelopment : Changed the language on redevelopment of existing impervious area so that it applies to impervious area in place as of November 16, 2005 (the effective date of the rule revisions). This closes a loophol e whereby a developer could pave just under an acre prior to coming in for a permit and have it treated as \"existing\" in order to avoid treatment of it. Redevelopment - Site Projects : Changed the language on redevelopment for Site Location projects under the gener al standards section so that the project must \"meet the general standards to the extent practicable as determined by the department.\" The date of November 16, 2005 is used as cut-off date for \"redevelopment\" sites. This provides flexibility to the applicant and the Departmen t, so that a very expensive treatment technology with high maintenance needs, such as an under parking lot manufactured system is not unrealistically required for a redevelopment site. Redevelopment in urban impaired stream watersheds : Dropped the requirement for redevelopment projects to meet the urban im paired stream standard if there will be no increase in impacts due to stormwater runoff. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 39 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Flooding standard: In the standard that governs flooding, the revision allows the department to grant a variance for discharges to rivers other than \"major river segments\" if the department determines there will be no adverse impact. Permit by rule: Changes Permit by Rule language to add clarity and greater consistency with current PBR practices under the Natu ral Resources Protection Act (NRPA). Permit shield : Revised Permit shield language to make it clearer and to emphasize that a project cannot get an exemption from a standa rd required under the Site Law by breaking the project into pieces and first complying wi th a lesser standard under the Stormwater Law. Appendix E : Changed language in Appendix E to include under-drained soil filter beds, with specifications consistent with language in our new Stormwater BMP Manual. Ch. 502, Appendix A: Lakes Most at Risk From Development: The following lakes were added to this list: Abrams Lake in Eastbrooke; Androscoggin Lake in Wayne; Long Pond in Belgrade; in Belgrade; Great Moose Lake in Hartland. Lake is the blooming\" category. Ch. 502, Appendix B: Urban Impaired Streams: Bobbin Mill Brook in Auburn was removed from the list.

The Department has a responsibility to educate the public about the environment, requirements of environmental laws, and how to protect Maine's natural resources. To accomplish these goals, the Department must help to fo ster and encourage greater stewardship. In order to affect the behavior changes we need from our citizens, some programs are adopting social marketing principles including: determining target audiences and message, gathering research data on target audiences, determining effective outreach tools, and assessing the effectiveness of campaigns. Target Audiences: Youth and Teachers - The DEP conducts 50-70 classroom visits (over 1,500 students), Envirothon, field days (over 1,200 students), Bug Mania and Earth Science Day (both with about 2,000 students). In addition DEP funds 3 watershed grants per year to students and their teachers who partner with local organizations to protect a local water resource. The DEP also sponsors and organizes Water Festivals for 800 students and their teachers in the southern part of the state each year and every other year in northern Maine. The DEP conducts teacher training, both pre-service and in-service training. The DEP hires AmeriCorps interns to assist with these programs. General Public- The DEP divides the public into categories based on the message of the campaign: homeowners for yard care practices, businesses for better commercial practices, etc. For example, the MS4 (Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System) communities conducted pilot projects to encourage targeted BMPS (i.e., yard care in some communities and pet waste pick-up in others) in targeted neighborhoods with evaluation as part of their permits. In addition the DEP is partnering with the MS4s and other NGOs on a mass media campaign, \"ThinkBlue; Clean Water Starts with You\". Assessment shows that the campaign has been very effective. LakeSmart is another example of reaching out to a subsection of the public. LakeSmart is an educational program that offers free opportunities for lakeshore homeowners to learn how to manage their home and yard to protect the water quality of their lake. Contractors, Municipal Officials, and Other Targeted Groups - Through the NonPoint Source Training Center, the DEP reaches out to contractors, landscapers, and code enforcement officers to bring technical assistance, certification, and new training. DEP staff also train wastewater treatment plant operators, planning boards, realtors, CEO code enforcement and other audiences as needed. Assessment : We continue to include assessment in our projects to be sure we are using our resources where we can have measurable results. We evaluate programs (the number of workshops held or number of brochures handed out) but we also consider impact - what did we accomplish on the ground (or in the water) and context - who is doing what and why. This assessment makes us more effective and efficient and we Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 41 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report know whether we are making concrete changes on the ground. Assessing whether our programs actually impact water quality will be the next step. The Environmental Impact and Economic & Social Costs/Benefits of Effectiv e Water Quality Programs Contact: Marianne DuBois, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207) 287-2115 email: marianne.s.dubois@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Assessment of the many types of costs and benefits associated with water quality changes is usually a very difficult task. While it is usually possible to determine that an improvement in water quality has been gained and to indicate a qualitative sense of the benefits observed; usually there is no easy way to directly assign a dollar figure to the changes and quantify this information in terms of the monetary value of benefits to human health or the environment. The economic tools that would be useful in helping to estimate the costs and benefits of improvement in water quality have not yet been fully developed. As future environmental problems grow in complexity (and in cost) and as public budgets tighten, justifying the expense or demonstrating the true benefit of water quality related programs are likely to be cause for delay of support for continued improvement of water resources. Continued development of sophisticated economic tools for measuring the benefits of environmental projects and methods is essential part of \"doing business\". The following sections contain brief summaries of selected water quality programs. NONPOINT SOURCE MANAGEMENT Contact: Norm Marcotte, DEP NPS (non-point source) pollution programs involving Federal grants under section 319 of the Clean Water Act in addition to non-federal matching funds.

Lake-related uses contribute more than $2.3 billion into the State's economy each year. In fact, lakes support over 52,000 jobs statewide. The total net economic value of Maine's Great Ponds (lakes and ponds 10 or more acres in surface area) is at least $8.5 billion dollars annually (1996 research updated to 2005 dollars). Surveys show that water clarity, quality of swimming, and scenic beauty are important to most people when they choose which lake to visit or where to buy property. A noticeable gain or loss in water quality could change statewide use rates by up to 13% (1.6 million user-days) each year. If water clarity declines, the potential loss in property value could be as much as $30,000 per property based on mid-1990s property values. These dramatic estimates make lake protection a priority for the entire state. THE POLLUTION PREVENTION (P2) PROGRAM Contact: Julie Churchill, P2 Program Manager, DEP Commissioner's Office, Office of Innovation and (OIA) Tel: (207) 287-2812 email: julie.m.churchill@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: http://www.state.me.us/dep/innovation/p2/ The Pollution Prevention (P2) Program is based on the practical notion that it is far more protective of the environment (in addition to being far more cost-effective) to eliminate or reduce pollution at its source rather than to clean up pollution that has already been released into an ecosystem. The P2 Program engages in a proactive approach that utilizes the common ideals of increased efficiency, conservation of resources, reduced waste (and costs), etc. to identify those points in a process that generate pollution. Once identified, the P2 Program also utilizes many approaches like forming good habits, purchasing new products and implementing new technologies to analyze, zero in on and help to correct those portions of a process that generate preventable pollution. Then the Program uses some or all of these tools to reduce or eliminate that source of pollution.

Davies, DEP, BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: (207) 287-3901 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov LISTING METHODOLOGY FOR THE 2008 305B / 303D INTEGRATED REPORT LIST Determination of water quality attainment is based on a water meeting all standards and criteria established for its assigned classification (38 MRSA Section 465, 465-A, 465-B). Waters are listed by Assessment Unit (HUC) and/or waterbody segment in one of five categories of attainment (see category descriptions below). All freshwaters in Maine in previous cycles were listed in a narrative Category 5-C \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury\" due to the Statewide fish consumption advisory due to mercury. All freshwaters are now moved to Category 4A \"Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is completed\", as a result of US EPA approval, on December 20, 2007, of a Regional Mercury TMDL. Other category listings are established independently from the statewide mercury advisory listing, thus all waters are listed in Category 4-A for mercury and in at least one other category. All marine waters are listed by narrative in Category 5-D \"Legacy Pollutants\" as well as in one other category, (see Marine explanation below). Each listing provides the Assessment Unit, Waterbody Number, Name, Size, Classification, Monitored Date, and depending on assessment determination, information on impairment, notes on previous listings, or other information. Listings for all surface waters are found in Appendices II-IV. LISTING CATEGORIES (1-5) Category 1: Attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. Highest level of attainment, waters in the assessment unit attains all applicable standards. Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. 1. Current data (collected within five years) indicates attainment, with no trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period. 2. Old data (greater than five years) indicates attainment and no change in any associated conditions. 3. Water quality models predict attainment under current loading, with no projected change in loading that would predict non-attainment. All estuarine and marine waters in Maine have an advisory for the consumption of shellfish (lobster tomalley) due to the pres ence of PCBs and dioxins presumed to be from atmospheric deposition or historical sources. The advisory is based on probability data that shellfish (lobster tom alley) inhabiting estuarine or marine waters may exceed the advisory action level for these substances. This Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Repo rt does not consider this statewide advisory in establishing other category listings. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 45 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report 4. Qualitative data or information from pr ofessional sources indicating attainment of standards and showing no identifiable sources (e.g. detectable points of entry of either licensed or unlicensed wastes) of pollution, low impact land use (e.g. intact riparian buffers, >90% forested watershed, little impervious surface), watershed within state or federal reserve land, park, wilderness area or similar conservation protection, essentially unaltered habitat, and absence of other potential stressors. 5. Determination that the direct drainage area has a human population of <0.1 per square mile according to U.S. Census data obtained in 2000 and watershed conditions as described in item 4, above. For lakes, determinations are based on census data at the town level and consider all towns in the direct drainage of larger (referred to in previous 305(b) reports as \"significant\") lakes. Populations for the remaining lakes (generally less than ten acres) are determined for the town listed as the point-of-record for the water according to the Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife Lake Index database. Category 2: Attains some of the designated uses; no use is threatened; and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. 1. Current data (collected within five years) for some standards indicating attainment, with no trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period, or an inadequate density of data to evaluate a trend. 2. Old data (greater than five years) for some standards indicating attainment, and no change in associated conditions. 3. Water quality models that predict attainment under current loading for some standards, with no projected change in loading that would predict non-attainment. 4. (For lakes) Probabilistic-based monitoring that indicates a high expectation of use attainment for certain classes of waters based on random monitoring of that class of waters. 5. Insufficient data for some standards, but qualitative data/information from professional sources indicate a low like lihood of impairment from any potential sources (e.g. high dilution, intermittent/seasonal effects, low intensity land use). Category 3: Insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). Assessment is based on combined evaluation of the following information. Monitoring schedules are assigned to these waters. 1. Insufficient or conflicting data that does not confirm either attainment or non- attainment of designated uses. 2. Qualitative data or information from professional sources showing the potential presence of stressors that may cause impairment of one or more uses; however, no quantitative water quality information confirms the presence of impairment-causing stressors. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 46 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report 3. Old data, with: a. low reliability, no repeat measurements (e.g. one-time synoptic data), b. a change of conditions without subsequent re-measurement; or c. no evidence of human causes or sources of pollution to account for observed water quality condition (natural conditions that do not attain water quality standards are allowed by 38 M.R.S.A. Section 464.4.C). 4. (For lakes) Current data indicates a return to (or a trend towards) attainment standards over the past few years but requi res confirmation; or conversely, that trophic or dissolved oxygen profile eval uation suggests deteriorating conditions requiring further study and verification. (Since lakes respond over a longer period of time and can be highly influenced by weather attributes, it is appropriate to recommend additional monitoring before attainment is determined.) Category 4: Impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but does not require development of a TMDL. A water body is listed in Category 4 when impairment is not caused by a pollutant; or, if impairment is caused by a pollut ant, but where a TMDL has already been completed, or where other enforceable controls are in place. An impaired waterbody will be listed in Category 5 if both a pollutant and a non-pollutant are involved that would independently cause an impaired or threatened condition. Waters are listed in one of the following Category 4 sub-lists when: 1. Current or old data for a standard indicates either impaired use, or a trend toward expected non-attainment within the listing period, but also where enforceable management changes are expected to correct the condition, 2. Water quality models that predicted impaired use under loading for some standard, also predict attainment when required controls are in place, or, 3. Quantitative or qualitative data/informati on from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is not from a pollutant(s) (e.g. habitat modification). 4-A: TMDL is completed. A TMDL is complete but insufficient new data exists to determine that attainment has been achieved. Note: For the 2008 cycle the 4A category now includes all freshwaters in Maine that were listed in previous cycles in a narrative Category 5-C \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury\" due to the Statewide fish consumption advisory due to mercury. On December 20, 2007 US EPA approved a Regional Mercury TMDL for the Northeast. 4-B: Other pollution control requirements are reasonably expected to result in attainment of standards in the near future. Waterbodies where enforceable controls have a reasonable expectation of attaining standards, but where no new data are available to determine that attainment has been achieved. (Enforceable controls may include: new wastewater discharge licenses issued without preparation of a TMDL, other regulatory orders, contracts for nonpoint source implementation projects, regulatory orders or contracts for hazardous waste remediation projects). Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 47 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report 4-C: Impairment is not caused by a pollutant. Waters impaired by habitat modification that is a result of human activity. Note : Natural conditions that do not attain water quality standards and criteria are allowed by 38 M.R.S.A. Section 464.4.C. Waters that show impairment due to natural phenomena are listed in Categories 1 through 3. Category 5: Waters impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s) and a TMDL is required. Waters are listed in one of the Category 5 sub-lists when: 1. Current data (collected within five years) for a standard either indicates impaired use, or a trend toward expected impairment within the listing period, and where quantitative or qualitative data/information from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is from a pollutant(s), 2. Water quality models predict impaired use under current loading for a standard, and where quantitative or qualitative data/in formation from professional sources indicates that the cause of impaired use is from a pollutant(s), or, 3. Those waters have been previously listed on the State's 303(d) list of impaired waters, based on current or old data that indicated the involvement of a pollutant(s), and where there has been no change in management or conditions that would indicate attainment of use. 5-A: Impairment caused by pollutants (other than those listed in 5-B through 5- D). A Total Maximum Daily Load is required and will be conducted by the State of Maine. TMDL schedules are assigned based on the value of a particular water (considering size, public use, proximity to population centers, and level of public interest for water quality improvement), the nature of the impairment and the source(s) of the problem, available information to complete the TMDL, and availability of staff and contractual resources to acquire information and complete the TMDL study. Projected schedules for TMDL completion are included in Chapter 8 as well as in the Appendices. 5-B: Impairment is caused solely by bacteria contamination. A TMDL is required. Certain waters impaired only by bacteria contamination may be high priority resources, such as shellfish areas, but a low priority for TMDL development if other actions are already in progress that will correct the problem in advance of TMDL development (e.g. better compliance). Certain small streams that are impaired solely by bacteria contamination but where recreation (swimming) is impractical because of their small size are listed in 5-B. Relative to other, more ecologically detrimental causes of impairment these waters are considered a lower priority for TMDL completion. A projected schedule of TMDL completion is included where applicable. Waterbodies impaired only by Combined Sewer Overflows, where current CSO Master Plans (Long-Term Control Plan) are in place, will be monitored to demonstrate that water quality standards are attained and that provisions are in place for both funding and compliance timetables. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 48 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report 5-C: Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition of mercury and a regional scale TMDL is required. Due to EPA approval of a regional scale TMDL for the control of mercury all of Maine's Category 5C waters have been administratively moved to Category 4A. 5-D: Impairment caused by a \"legacy\" pollutant. This sub-category includes: 1. waters impaired only by PCBs, dioxins, DDT, or other substances already banned from production or use. It includes waters impaired by contaminated sediments where there is no additional extrinsic load occurring. This is a low priority for TMDL development since there is no controllable load. 2. coastal waters that have a consumption advisory for the tomalley (hepato-pancreas organ) of lobsters due to the presence of persistent bioaccumulating toxics found in that organ. This is a low priority for TMDL development since there is no identifiable and controllable load. DELISTING FROM AN IMPAIRED TO AN UNIMPAIRED CATEGORY . Because there are a number of listing options available in the integrated list, some waterbodies may be removed from the previous 303(d) list, however, only under certain circumstances. The State must provi de new information, to EPA's satisfaction, as a basis for not listing specific waters that had been previously included on a 303(d) list. Acceptable reasons for not listing previ ously listed waters as provided in 40 CFR 130.7(b) may include situations where: The assessment and interpretation of more recent or more accurate data demonstrates that the applicable water quality standard(s) is bei ng met (list in Category 1, 2, (3 for lakes). The results of more refined water quality modeling demonstrate that the applicable water quality standard(s) is being met (list in Category 1 or 2). It can be demonstrated that errors or insuffici encies in the original data and information led to the water being incorrectly listed (list in Category 3). It can be documented that there are changes in the conditions or criteria that originally caused the water to be impaired and therefore originally led to the listing. For example, new control equipment has been installed, a disc harge has been eliminated, or new criteria adopted (list in Category 1, 2, 3, or 4-B). The State has demonstrated pursuant to 40 CF R 130.7(b)(1)(ii), that there are effluent limitations required by State or local authority, which are more stringent than technology-based effluent limitations, requi red by the Clean Water Act, and that these more stringent effluent limitations will result in the attainment of water quality standards for the pollutant causing the impairment within a reasonable time (list in Category 4-B). The State has demonstrated pursuant to 40 CFR 130.7(b)(1)(iii), that there are other pollution control requirements requ ired by State, local, or federal authority that will result in attainment of water quality standards for a sp ecific pollutant(s) within a reasonable time (list in Category 4-B). The State included on a previous Section 303(d) list some Water Quality Limited Segments beyond those that are required by EPA regulations, e.g., waters where there is no pollutant associated with the impairment (list in Category 4-C). A TMDL has been approved or es tablished by EPA since the last 303(d) list (list in Category 4-A). Chapter 8 Tables 8-1, 8-2 and 8-3 present waters that have been delisted from Maine's 2006 impaired waters (303d) list. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 49 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Assessment Criteria Tables 4-1 through 4-3 provide the designated use categories and the criteria (with references) used to assess a water's attainment of the use. A determination of non- attainment is only made when there is documented evidence (e.g. monitoring data) indicating that one or more criteria are not attained. Such data are also weighed against evidence that there are plausible human-caused factors that may contribute to the violation of criteria (38 MRSA Section 464.4.C).

Data from unique events such as a spill, an accident, a short-duration license exceedence, or a drought or flood are not used in an assessment determination. The following general principles for each criteria type are used in making an assessment: Biomonitoring Criteria: For samples collected in accordance with the Biomonitoring Program Quality Assurance Project Pl an, assessments are based on probability results of the numeric biocriteria models for tiered aquatic life Classes AA/A, Class B and Class C Criteria (Maine DEP Rule Chapter 579: Classification Attainment Evaluation Using Biological Criteria for Rivers and Streams). Aquatic life criteria are deemed to be attained when the applicable biocriterion is met with probability greater than 60%. Final determination of attainment may in some cases be made by professional judgment, applied in accordance with the procedures described in Maine DEP Chapter 579. Lake Trophic State: Assessment is based on measures of transparency, chlorophyll a, total phosphorus and color (Table 4-4). When lakes lack this information, a trophic determination made by DIF&W is used, if available. Their determination is more subjective and generally applies to the lake system as a whole including adjacent wetlands and fisheries productivity. Trophic determination is tracked by source (DEP or DIF&W) in the assessment database. Table 4-4 Lake Trophic State Parameters and Guidelines Numerical Guidelines for Evaluation of Trophic Status in Maine * (Note: Dystrophy is not often evaluated as a trophic category separately from categories below.) Trophic Status Parameter1Oligotrophic Mesotrophic2Eutrophic SDT3> 8 meters 4-8 meters < 4 meters CHL a < 1.5 ppb 1.5 - 7 ppb > 7 ppb Total SDT, CHL a, and Total Phosphorus based on long-term means. 2 No repeated nuisance algal blooms. 3 If color is > 30 Standard Platinum Units (SPU) or not known, chlorophyll a concentration (CHL a), dissolved oxygen and best professional judgment used to assign trophic category. 4 TSI = Trophic State Indices are calculated when a dequate data exists and color is at or below 30 SPU. * This table is a duplicate of Table 4-26 in the Lakes Section of this Chapter ( appears twice for convenience). Support of Indigenous Species: Assessment based on the known absence of a species that previously was documented as indigenous to a waterbody in historical records collected by state or federal agencies or through published scientific literature; or based on non-attainment of water quality criteria necessary to support indigenous species. Dissolved Oxygen: Assessment of dissolved oxygen is based on the results of repeated measurements, collected over time. Single excursions of the criterion or excursions within the range of sampling or instrument error (as established in a Quality Assurance Project Plan) may not be used in every case unless there is corroborating evidence of reasonable potential for impairment of a use. Assessment Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 52 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report may also be based on the use of water quality models (e.g. QUAL2E) based on present or expected loadings. New legislation provides that dissolved oxygen in the thermocline and deeper waters of a riverine impoundment will not be used for measurement of water quality attainment. Ambient Water Quality Criteria: Assessment is based on measured exceedance of Statewide Water Quality Criteria (or Site-specific criteria where they may exist), or reasonable potential to exceed the criteria following EPA's Principle of Independent Applicability and Technical support document. Single excursions of the criterion or excursions within the range of sampling or instrument error (as established in a Quality Assurance Project Plan) may not be used in every case unless there is corroborating evidence of reasonable potential for impairment of a use. Assessment may also be based on the use of water quality models (e.g. dilution models) based on present or expected loadings. Nutrient/Eutrophication Biological Indicators: Non-numeric listing criteria for this cause of Aquatic Life Use impairment consist of documentation of abnormal biological findings that indicate nutrient enrichment in rivers and streams. Excess nutrients impair Aquatic Life Use through alteration of habitat from excessive growths of plants and algae, changes in dissolved gases like oxygen, caused by excess algal growth, resulting in diurnal dissolved oxygen sags, and alteration of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. Bacteria: Assessment is based on repeated measurements to establish an annual geometric mean. Instantaneous (single sample) criteria are not used for water quality assessment due to the high variability associated with a single measurement. There must be a plausible human or domestic animal source of the bacteria for an impairment determination to be made (38 M.R.S.A Section 465, 465-A, 465-B). Water Color: Assessment based on repeated measurements of discharge performance data (pulp and paper discharges only). General Provisions: pH based on repeated measurement (between 6.0 and 8.5 for freshwaters; 7.0 and 8.5 for marine waters), however, certain naturally occurring waterbody types (e.g. bogs, aquifer lakes, high elevation lakes) or events may naturally have low pH and affect downstream waters. Use impairment from solids is subjectively determined. Radioactivity in surface water is not presently monitored.

Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Tel: 207-287-3901 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/classification/index.htm Maine has four water quality classes of rivers and streams: AA, A, B, and C (38 M.R.S.A. Section 465). Each classification assigns designated uses and water quality criteria (narrative and numeric), and may place specific restrictions on certain activities (Table 4-1 and 4-16) such that the goal conditions of each class may be achieved or maintained. Definitions of terms used in the classification are provided in 38 M.R.S.A. Section 466. Class AA waters are managed for their outstanding natural ecological, recreational, social, and scenic qualities. Direct discharge of wastewater, dams, and other significant human disturbances are prohibited. Tiered aquatic life use goals in water quality standards direct that the biological condition of this classification be approximately Tier 1-2 on the Biological Condition Gradient (Davies and Jackson 2006; USEPA 2005) Class A waters are managed for high quality with limited human disturbance allowed; aquatic life use goal approximately Tier 1-2 on the Biological Condition Gradient. Direct discharges are allowed but highly restricted. Class B waters are general-purpose waters and are managed to attain good quality water; aquatic life use goal approximately Tier 3 on the Biological Condition Gradient. Well-treated discharges with ample dilution are allowed. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 59 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Class C waters are managed to attain at least the swimmable-fishable goals of the federal Clean Water Act and to maintain the structure and function of the biological community; aquatic life use goal approximately Tier 4 on the Biological Condition Gradient.

The last triennial review occurred in 2002-03 when the Department conducted statewide workshops to obtain public input and proposals to change the management classification assigned to specific waterbodies. The Board held hearings that resulted in recommendations to the Maine Legislature for the upgrade of part or all of 75 rivers and streams. Sixty one segment upgrades were passed by the 2003 Legislature (P.L. 2003 Chapter 317) and the 14 remaining segments were passed in the next session. The next review of water quality classifications is currently underway (2008) for presentation to the Legislature in 2009. The current distribution of waters assigned to these four water quality classes is summarized in Table 4-18: Table 4-18 Percent Distribution of River/Stream Water Classes Class Percent of Major* Mainstem River Miles Percent of Total River and Stream Miles AA 27.5 % 5.8 % A 22.3 % 44.1 % B 29.6 % 47.9 % C 20.6 % 2.2 % * Major mainstem rivers are rivers that have a watershed of 500 or greater square miles. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 60 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report SUMMARY OF STATEWIDE RIVER AND STREAM ATTAINMENT STATUS Contact: Susan P. Davies, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Assessment (DEA) Tel: 207-287-3901 email: Susan.P.Davies@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov The Integrated Assessment report to Congress requires the assignment of each Assessment Unit into one of five categories (Section 4-1, Assessment Methodology). A water is determined to be impaired if one or more of the uses assigned by its classification in not attained, as determined by the criteria assigned to that water class. An overall use attainment summary is provided in Tables 4-6 and 4-19. The 2008 use attainment assessment reports on assessment units amounting to 31,218 miles of rivers and streams that are tracked in the Assessment Database (ADB). Information on the status of individual assessment units may be found in Listings on Individual Waters, Appendix II, Categories 1-5.

The 2008 assessment assigned 4,347 miles (14%) of rivers and streams to Category 1 (fully attaining all uses other than statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). There has been no change in the amount of Category 1 waters since 2006. The Department has determined through monitoring and evaluation that large areas of the state should be included in this category where there is significant protection afforded by either state or private conservation efforts. Maine is fortunate to have entire sub-watersheds where there is no human habitation, few roads and only minimal disturbance (typically well managed forestry operations that are well buffered to protect water quality) or significant conservation ownership. Category 2 (Appendix II Category 2 ). The 2008 assessment assigned 25,288 (81%) miles of rivers and streams to Category 2 (fully attaining all uses other than statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). The increase was due to confirmation that some previously impaired waters are now attaining uses. Category 3 (Appendix II Category 3 ). The 2008 assessment assigned 379 (1%) miles of rivers and streams to Category 3 (attainment undetermined except for statewide Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 61 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). Most of these segments have been assigned to Category 3 because of inconclusive or conflicting monitoring data and the rest are in Category 3 because an initial evaluation of non-attainment requires re-sampling to confirm. Category 4 (Appendix II Category 4 ). Category 4 impaired waters do not require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). Category 4 has been administratively increased by 31,218 miles in 2008 because all freshwaters in Maine were moved from Category 5C (statewide mercury impairment) to Category 4A (TMDL approved) due to US EPA approval, on December 20, 2007, of a Regional Mercury TMDL for the Northeastern States. The 2008 assessment also assigned 216 (1.5%) miles of rivers and streams to Category 4 for non-mercury reasons. The approval of TMDLs for 3 impaired segments has increased the recorded miles in Category 4 by 7 miles as compared to 2006. Waters in Category 4 are placed into one of three subcategories: 4-A for waters that already have a TMDL that has been approved by EPA 3 new segments and 5 Causes have been added to 4-A as compared to the 2006 Category 5, 2 causes of non-attainment have been moved from 4A to Category 2- Fully Attaining 1 new cause of impairment has been added to a previously 4A listed segment 4-B for waters where there is an enforceable mechanism in place to bring the water into attainment (e.g. new hatchery wastewater discharge license) No new segments have been moved into Cate gory 4-B from 2006 Category 5 waters , 4-C for waters where there is no pollutant involved in the impairment problem No new segments have been added to 4-C since 2006 Category 5 (Appendix II Category 5 ). Impaired waters that require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determination. The 2008 assessment assigned 988 miles (3%) of rivers and streams to Category 5 (impaired for one or more uses as well as statewide mercury advisory as explained in Category 5C below). This is a net decrease of 7 miles in Category 5. Waters in Category 5 are placed into one of four subcategories: 5-A - waters impaired by pollutants; a priority for TMDL development, 1 new cause of impairment listing, occurring in 1 previously listed segment (1.2 miles) has been added since the 2006 reporting cycle final draft TMDLs for 16 impaired segments are scheduled to be submitted to EPA in fiscal year 2008. Additionally, reports on 4 impaired segments are in preparation to indicate that TMDL are not required (Royal estuary, Hermon and Hammond Lakes, Sabattus River) 5-B- waters impaired by no causes other th an bacteria from Combined Sewer Overflows or other sources (except statewide mercury advis ory as explained in Category 5C below); a lower priority for TMDL development. 1 new segment has been added to 5B 5-C- waters impaired by atmospheric deposition of mercury (Inactive Category due to EPA approved Regional Mercury TMDL ). All freshwaters in Maine have an advisory for the consumption of fish due to the presence of mercury presumed to be from atmospheric deposition. A Regional MercuryTMDL has been approved by US EPA making these waters Category 4A. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 62 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report This Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report does not consider this statewide advisory in establishing other category listings. The advisory is based on pr obability data that a stream, river, or lake may contain some fish that exceed the advisory action level (Maine uses a lower action level of 0.2 mg/kg (edible portion) than t hat established by the USEPA). Any freshwater may contain both contaminated and uncontam inated fish depending on size, age, and species occurrence in that water. The advis ory applies to all freshwaters because it may be impossible for someone eating a fish to be able to tell where the fish originated and whether or not it has a high level of mercury. 5-D for waters impaired by the residuals of \"legacy\" activities. No new segments have been added to Category 5-D as compared to 2006. NUMBER OF SEGMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN DELISTED . Two river segments and 3 impairment causes have been moved to Category 2 from 2006 Impaired Waters List in this reporti ng cycle (see Table 8-1) and 3 segments and 5 causes have been moved from Category 5A to Category 4A due to approval of TMDLs. As with any assessment of this kind, the identification of impaired waters or delisted waters cannot be considered complete but rather is a reflection of the findings at a particular point in time, relative to the level of monitoring effort expended by the agency and other cooperating contributors. While new and expanded monitoring has identified additional miles of impaired waters, this should not be interpreted as an indication that Maine's waters are under some new or increasing threat. Rather, the State has been better able to assess its waters with improved monitoring tools and increased participation from cooperators. All of the new impaired listings appear to be due to conditions that have probably been in place for many years. LISTING CAUSES , STRESSORS AND SOURCES OF IMPAIRMENT Cause and stress information for rivers and streams is provided in Table 4-9. Sources of impairment are provided in Table 4-13. The way that DEP groups Cause/Stressor Types in the 2008 report is slightly different from 2004 and earlier reports due to the migration of data into the EPA Assessment Database. These differences by themselves do not reflect actual changes to causes, stressors or sources affecting Maine waters. The ADB should eventually enable increasingly accurate and consistent tracking of causes, stressors and sources as the data is captured and stored in subsequent years. Causes (Table 4-9): The greatest number of impaired miles (647) is still due to toxics, especially legacy pollutants such as DDT, dioxin and PCBs. For most mainstem river segments that are affected by pulp and paper mill discharges, dioxins were listed in Category 4B in 2004. However, those same segments are now listed in Category 5D for legacy PCB and dioxin contamination of fish tissue. While absolute elimination of the production of dioxin secondary to the pulp and paper bleaching process has probably not been accomplished measureable differences are no longer detectable. Results of MDEP's Above/Below test documented by 2005 that there was no measurable difference in dioxin concentrations in fish above and below each tested mill. Non-attainment of aquatic life criteria as determined by observations of biological effects accounts for 332 miles of impairment with oxygen depletion accounting for 398 miles. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 63 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Sources (Table 4-13): Atmospheric deposition of mercury affects all waters of the State and is the largest single source of pollution. Legacy pollutant sources such as dioxin and PCBs affect 364 miles. General agr icultural NPS sources affect 330 miles. It is important to understand that miles attributed to causes and sources in Tables 4-9 and 4-13 may be listed more than once if a waterbody is subjected to several different types of disturbance. MAIN STEMS OF MAJOR RIVERS Most of the mainstem rivers are in good condition and are attaining their classification (mostly Class B or C quality, although significant segments of the St. John, Allagash, East and West Branches of the Penobscot, St. Croix, and Kennebec Rivers are Class AA and A). The primary impairment issue on the larger rivers is non-attainment of the Fish Consumption use, with segments of the Androscoggin, Kennebec, Penobscot, Salmon Falls and Sebasticook Rivers listed in either Category 4 or Category 5. Tissue monitoring studies have found legac y PCB and dioxin contamination in mainstem rivers. Two (2) of Maine's Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) communities (Fort Kent and Kittery) have completed their CSO abatement projects and no longer have permitted CSOs. Calais has recently been permitted for several CSOs discharging to the St. Croix River. Needed monitoring has had to be re-scheduled for some mainstem river segments due to lack of appropriately low flow levels required for water quality modeling (e.g., Sandy River).

For the 2006-07 reporting period, there were two documented fish kills. In September 2006, fish (predominantly brook trout) in Longfellow Brook in Caribou were killed from contaminated runoff from a fertilizer blending and distribution facility. A Consent Agreement and Enforcement Order was signed to remediate the source. In July 2007, a fish kill (predominantly minnows) occurred on Hart Brook in Lewiston presumably from urban runoff. No definitive source has been identified for that kill. ACHIEVING COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF ALL STREAMS : PROBABILITY -BASED DESIGN MONITORING Contact: Susan P.

Additional topics required under Section 314 addressed in the 2006 report include: Maine's definition of Significant Lakes, Trophic Status of Significant Publicly Owned Lakes, Lake Rehabilitation Techniques, Acid Effects on Lakes, Toxics in Maine lakes, trend analyses and climate considerations. A number of tables reappear in this report at the request of EPA Region I staff. Monitoring of Maine lakes continues to include reliance on a strong volunteer-based program, the Maine Volunteer Lake Monitoring Program (www.mainevolunteerlakemonitors.org ) as well as both targeted and probability based monitoring performed by state staff. The Lake Assessment Section participated in a US EPA Region I probability-based lake monitoring effort in 2006 as well as the National Lake Assessment effort in 2007. ATTAINMENT OF CLASSIFICATION The state designated a subset of the total population of lake as 'Significant Lakes' as requested by EPA under Section 314 in the early 1990s. Table 4-20 summarizes numbers and acreages for all lakes having an identification number as well as the subset of Significant Lakes. Table 4-20 \"All\" and \"Significant\" Lake Category Information Maine Lake Population Summary Number Acres All Lakes (40%) actively assessed to determine classification attainment status are: Aquatic Life Support, Fish Consumption, Recreation In/On, and Drinking Water Supply (after disinfection/treatment). Table 4-21 summarizes how lake attainment status relates to specific Listing Categories used in the 2008 report. Table 4-21 Summary of Listing Categories and Subcategories used in the 2008 Assessment of Maine lakes.

Lake specific changes are included in Chapter 8, \"Summary of 2006 Category Changes\" as well as in the appendix. Category 1: Lake waters attaining all designated uses and water quality standards, and no use is threatened. For the purposes of this assessment, lakes having no population in their direct watersheds have been listed in 'Category 1, Attaining all standards', with the exception of four lakes which are listed in category 4c, in non-attainment of the Aquatic Life Use (habitat) due to non-pollutant (hydrologic modification). The number of lakes listed in Category 1 is 2,857, totaling 295,443 acres. Waters are summarized by the 10-digit HUC (Hydrologic Unit Code) within which they are located (Appendix III, Category 1). No lakes have moved in or out of this Listing Category since the 2006 reporting cycle. Category 2: Lake waters attaining some of the designated use(s), no use is threatened, and insufficient data or no data and information is available to determine if the remaining uses are attained or threatened (with presumption that all uses are attained). The Department is highly confident that these waters attain the following designated uses: drinking water (after disinfection / treatment), recreation in/on the water, fishing (excluding fish consumption), and as habitat for fish and other aquatic life. Category 2 contains 2,881 lakes or 596,474 lake acres. Waters are summarized by the 10-digit HUC within which they are located (Appendix III, Category 2). One lake, Estes Lake has been moved from Category 3 into Category 2 due to improvements in water quality over the past 10 years primarily due to an upgrade in treatment of a municipal discharge. Evaluation of data indicates that these lakes are currently in attainment of their classified uses of Primary Contact and Aquatic Life Support. Category 3: Lake waters with insufficient data and information to determine if designated uses are attained (with presumption that one or more uses may be impaired). There are currently 10 lakes covering 17,777 acres listed in Category 3 (Appendix III, Category 3) all of which are designated as 'Significant'. These lakes may or may not be in attainment of 'aquatic life' and/or 'primary contact' criteria. The Department has data suggesting that these waters are meeting some designated use criteria but has evidence that suggests the lakes are 'borderline' with respect to another use. These lakes are the highest priority for data collection over the next few years. Estes Lake was moved out of Category 3 into Category 2 since the 2006 assessment. Category 4: Lake waters that are impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses, but do not require development of a TMDL. There are currently 28 lakes covering 73,600 acres listed in Category 4. These lakes fall into two subcategories: waters on which TMDLs have been completed (4A) and waters with impairments not caused by a pollutant (4C). Category 4A contains 23 lakes totaling 24,636 acres. This includes the addition of 5 lakes for which TMDL Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 67 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report studies have been completed since the 2006 report. Completed TMDL documents for these waters are posted on the DEP website at the following URL: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/tmdl2.htm Note: For the 2008 cycle the 4A category now includes all freshwaters in Maine that were listed in previous cycles in a narrative Category 5-C \"Impairment caused by atmospheric deposition were of mercury\" due to the Statewide fish consumption advisory due to mercury. On December 20, 2007 US EPA approved a Regional Mercury TMDL. Five lakes (48,964 acres) continue to be listed in Category 4C, lake water impairment not caused by a pollutant. All of these lakes are in non-attainment of aquatic life (habitat) standards due to hydromodification (drawdown). Category 5: Lake waters that are impaired or threatened for one or more designated uses by a pollutant(s), TMDL development is required. Three sub categories have been designated under Category 5; however lakes have been listed in only one. Category 5A includes 4 lakes (3,658 acres) all of which are designated as 'Significant' (lakes impaired by pollutants, and require a TMDL to be conducted by the State of Maine). These totals reflect the movement of 5 lakes to Category 4A. Appendix III, Category 5A lists these lakes, indicates target dates for TMDL completion and indicates development priority. Table 4-22 summarizes individual use support for lakes in Category 5A.

Maine is fortunate to be located a considerable distance from many sources of atmospheric deposition that result in acidification of surface waters. Some smaller headwater and seepage lakes having naturally low pH are likely slightly more acidic due to such atmospheric inputs but not to levels that have conclusively altered the biota or caused Maine to consider mitigation activities. Table 4-25 provides a summary of acidity assessment efforts in Maine lakes.

Administration of the sticker program for motorized watercraft, the funding mechanism for the Department's work on invasive aquatic species, was amended by statute. Boaters with Maine-registered watercraft now pay automatically with their annual purchase of boat registration. This change assures compliance for boats registered in Maine and reduces processing cost, thereby generating increased revenue for program. Boaters with out-of-state registrations will still be required to purchase a boat sticker to affix next to their out-of-state registration. As of February 2008, 28 inland bodies of water are infested with invasive aquatic plants, 25 infested with variable milfoil ( Myriophyllum heterophyllum ). Maine's hydrilla control its fifth year in 2007 (Hydrilla verticillata identified in one lake ). In 2007, 49,783 Courtesy Boat Inspections were conducted, a 23% increase over 2006 and 2005. One of two most recently documented infestations, an isolated plant in a Maine/New Hampshire border lake, was eradicated and removed from the State's infestation list due to rapid response by local lake stewards. Of heightened concern is the threat posed by the diatom Didymosphenia geminate (rock snot) , documented in New Hampshire but not yet in Maine. This threat is spurring educational outreach by the Department to anglers and river users to prevent spread. Estuaries / Ocean Contact: David Courtemanch, Director, Divi 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 70 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report BACKGROUND Maine has three classes for the management of estuarine and marine waters: SA, SB, and SC. SA waters are managed for high water quality with limited human interference allowed. No direct discharges of pollutants, including those from finfish aquaculture, are allowed in SA waters. SB waters are general-purpose waters and are managed to attain good quality water. Well-treated discharges of pollutants that have ample dilution are allowed. SC waters are managed for the lowest water quality, but they must be fishable and swimmable as well as maintain the structure and function of the biological community. Well-tr eated discharges of pollutants are allowed in SC waters. Each class is managed for designated uses and each has dissolved oxygen, bacteria and aquatic life standards (see Table 4-32 below). Table 4-27 Maine's Estuarine and Coastal Waters Classification Standards Class Designated Use Dissolved Oxygen Bacteria Aquatic Life SA Habitat for fish and estuarine and marine life Recreation in and on the water Fishing Aquaculture (not finfish) Propagation and harvesting shellfish Navigation As naturally occurs As naturally occurs As naturally occurs SB Habitat for fish and estuarine and marine life Recreation in and on the water Fishing Aquaculture Propagation and harvesting shellfish Navigation Industrial process and cooling water supply Hydroelectric power generation Not less than 85% of saturation Enterococcus not higher than geometric mean 8/100ml or instantaneous of 54/100ml from 5/15 to 9/30 Not exceed criteria of National Shellfish Sanitation Program for shellfish harvesting Support all indigenous estuarine and marine species Discharge not to cause closure of shellfish beds SC Habitat for fish and estuarine and marine life Recreation in and on the water Fishing Aquaculture Propagation and restricted shellfish harvesting Navigation Industrial process and cooling water supply Hydroelectric power generation Not less than 70% of saturation Enterococcus not higher than geometric mean 14/100ml or instantaneous of 94/100ml from 5/15 to 9/30 Not exceed criteria of National Shellfish Sanitation Program for restricted shellfish harvesting Maintain structure and function of the resident biological community The areal distribution of the three marine classes is shown in Table 4-28 and Figure 4- 5 below: Table 4-28 Area and Percentage of Marine and Estuarine Waters in Each Classification Class Square Miles Percentage SA 211 7.41 % SB 2,606 91.58 % SC 29 1.01 % Total % Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 71 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Figure 4-1 Percentage of Estuarine and Ma rine Waters in Each Classification This chapter provides an assessment of the degree to which water quality supports the designated use defined by the State of Maine statutes for the protection of aquatic life. Designated uses in this chapter and in Chapter 7 (Public Health - Related Assessments) are divided into two broad use categories: protection of human health and protection of aquatic life. The protection of these uses will result in the protection of other uses (e.g. navigation, industrial process and cooling supply). Applicable monitoring results and attainment assessments are summarized within each of these two categories in this chapter as well as in Chapter 7. SOURCES OF MONITORING DATA The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the National Coastal Assessment/University of Southern Maine, the Department of Marine Resources (DMR), the Casco Bay Estuary Project (CBEP), and a variety of volunteer monitoring groups such as the Spruce Creek Association monitor Maine's coastal waters. DMR monitors for indicators of human pathogens (e.g., fecal coliforms) and biotoxins (e.g., Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning). The purpose of DMR monitoring is to protect human health by managing shellfish harvest areas (see Chapter 7 of this report). DEP monitors toxic contaminants in tissues and assesses water quality using data collected by DEP and other organizations. DEP also participates in the Gulf of Maine Council's Gulfwatch Project that surveys toxic contamination in mussel tissue in the Gulf of Maine. The Maine State Planning Office Coastal Program and University of Maine Cooperative Extension/Sea Grant are responsible for managing and coordinating the Maine Healthy Beaches Program (see Chapter 7 of this report). Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 72 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report The Casco Bay Estuary Project (CBEP), funded by EPA's National Estuary Program, monitors and also supports other monitoring efforts in the Bay, through Friends of Casco Bay (FOCB) and other entities and coordinates the National Coastal Assessment for the entire Maine coast with the assistance of Maine DEP. The GoMOOS (Gulf of Maine Ocean Observation System) program provides data on the gulf that is collected from buoys, satellites and radar. Since all the buoys are located in offshore waters at present, the data are not used for this assessment. The data are useful in determining the signals coming from the Gulf rather than land. DEP would benefit from the placement of some new buoys closer to land in order to better monitor and understand near shore waters and land/water interactions. Results from these various monitoring sources provide the basis for determining attainment of classification and designated uses. One of the biggest challenges ahead is to get all the data that is collected into a central location and into useable, universally-translatable formats. SUMMARY OF STATEWIDE STATUS This Integrated Assessment report requires the assignment of each Assessment Unit into one of five categories (see Methodology). Specific waters are determined to be impaired if they do not attain one or more of the uses assigned by their classification (as determined by the criteria assigned to that classification). For this reporting cycle, the Maine DEP has elected to maintain the same listing for estuarine and marine waters as reported in the 2006 Integrated Report: http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm There are several reasons for this. The 2006 report was delayed in submission and subsequently used more recent data than would have been available on April 1, 2006 reporting date. More recently, the Maine DEP has been engaged with DMR in revising the way that water quality data is reported including development of Assessment Units (similar to what is used in the ADB for freshwaters) and digitized maps all of which will make reporting more consistent and easier to track. These will be used in the 2010 report cycle. Overall use attainment summary for 2008 is provided below and in Table 4-8. Category 1: The 2008 assessment assigns no estuarine and marine waters to Category 1 because there were no waters where all Classification Standards were monitored adequately in a waterbody segment to determine if standards were being met. Category 2 : The 2008 assessment assigns 2,685.17 (94.35%) square miles of estuarine and marine waters to Category 2 (fully attaining*). Category 3: The 2008 assessment assigns 4.43 (0.16%) square miles of estuarine and marine waters to Category 3 (attainment undetermined*). Category 4 : The 2008 assessment assigns no estuarine and marine waters to Category 4 (impaired for one or more uses*). Category 5: The 2008 assessment assigns 156.39 (5.50%) square miles of estuarine or marine waters to Category 5 (impaired for one or more uses*). This Integrated Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 73 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report does not consider the statewide lobster tomalley consumption advisory that is in place due to the potential presence of PCBs and dioxin in all 2,845.99 square miles of Maine's coastal waters. Category 5 impaired waters require the development of a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) determination. No TMDLs were completed for estuarine/marine waters since the 2006 report was completed. Waters are placed in one of four subcategories: 5-A for waters impaired by pollutants, 5-B-1 for waters impaired only by bacteria, 5-B-2 for waters affected only by Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO), 5-D for waters impaired by the residuals of \"legacy\" activities. As with any assessment of this kind, the identification of impaired waters cannot be considered complete but rather is a reflection of the findings (to date) relative to the level of effort expended by the agency and other cooperating contributors. * All estuarine and marine waters in Mai ne have an advisory for the c onsumption of shellfish (lobster tomalley) due to the presence of PCBs and dioxins. The adv isory is based on probability data that shellfish (lobster tomalley) inhabiting estuarine or marine waters may exceed the ad visory action level for these substances. CAUSES AND SOURCES OF IMPAIRMENT IN CATEGORIES 4 AND 5 Cause and stress type information is provided in Table 4-12, while information on sources of impairment is provided in Table 4-16. The general category of \"toxics\" is by far the cause/stressor that impairs the largest area of marine and estuarine waters in the State. In fact, the \"toxics\" subcategories of PCBs and dioxins impaired all 2,845.99 square miles of marine/estuarine waters that were assessed in 2008 due to the statewide lobster tomalley consumption advisory described in the previous section. After toxics, the second greatest impaired area (153.55 square miles) of estuarine/marine waters is due to bacterial contamination. By comparison, each of the other remaining general causes is responsible for impairing areas of a few square miles or less. Industrial point sources have been the largest contributing source category for dioxin. Recently there has been no measurable difference in dioxin concentrations in fish above and below each mill. Though small, unmeasurable discharges still may be occurring these are not significant with respect to bioaccumulation in fish compared to the MCDC's Fish Tissue Action Level. Some industrial loads that are treated through municipal point sources are additional sources although pretreatment is required in most cases. These industrial sources account for all of the shellfish (lobster tomalley) consumption listed waters where dioxins remain the primary contaminant. NATIONAL COASTAL ASSESSMENT : PROBABILITY -BASED MONITORING Related Website: www.epa.gov/emap/nca/ The purpose of the National Coastal Assessment (NCA) is to estimate the current status of the condition of the nation's coastal resources on a regional and national basis using ecological indicators. The National Coastal Assessment is based on a probability- based, stratified sampling design. Stations were selected randomly to represent strata (regions) of similar characteristics e.g., Casco Bay, Long Island Sound, etc. Conclusions based on data from such programs are statistically valid for the strata, but are not necessarily representative of conditions at a particular station. The National Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 74 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Coastal Assessment has not actively sampled the Maine coast since the last reporting cycle. Please refer to page 95 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for information on the National Coastal Assessment. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm PROTECTION OF MARINE LIFE (DESIGNATED USE : HABITAT FOR FISH AND ESTUARINE / MARINE LIFE ) ATTAINMENT OF DISSOLVED OXYGEN STANDARDS Four water body segments are listed as impaired waters (three in Category 5 and one in Category 4) because they do not attain state standards for dissolved oxygen. The reasons for non-attainment are varied and include natural factors such as benthic respiration and physical circulation factors, as well as potential loadings from point and nonpoint sources. The draft Royal River Waste Load Allocation Study recommends delisting the estuary for dissolved oxygen. The estuary will remain in Category 5 because of high bacteria counts and closure of the shellfishery. The draft Mousam River Waste Load Study indicates that the majority of oxygen loss is due to benthic respiration and circulation factors and that the Kennebunk treatment facility has only a very marginal effect. Upgrades are occurring at that facility and the estuary will be reevaluated after those occur. The upper New Meadows estuary and \"Lake\" (estuarine salinity) does not meet dissolved oxygen standards. The presumed cause is the partial impoundment on Old Route 1 at the Brunswick-West Bath town line. A modeling study is being conducted to better understand causes and determine solutions. The Piscataqua River estuary has a completed TMDL however implementation in ME and NH is incomplete. Generally, data from various studies and volunteer monitoring show oxygen levels along the cost to be adequate to protect marine life. Some estuaries have oxygen levels that do not meet their classification criteria and is concluded that many of these instances where criteria are not attained are a result of natural processes. The Maine DEP is initiating a study in cooperation with the USEPA to assess benthic respiration in a number of high quality / least impacted estuaries to assess what expected background values may be. CASCO BAY ESTUARY PARTNERSHIP Contact: Director, Casco Bay Website: www.cascobay.usm.maine.edu The Bay Estuary Partnership work focuses in five priority areas: habitat protection, toxic pollution, stewardship, clam flat and swimming beach health, and stormwater pollution. Friends of Casco Bay (FOCB), with support from CBEP, has conducted the Citizens Water Quality Monitoring Program in the bay for the past twelve years. More than 100 Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 75 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report citizen volunteers sample surface waters at 80 shore-based stations. They also assist FOCB professional staff with sampling at 10 profile stations located throughout Casco Bay. Measurements include temperature, salinity, pH, water clarity, and dissolved oxygen. The program was expanded to include measurements for chlorophyll fluorescence and dissolved inorganic nutrient concentrations. Please refer to page 104 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for summary of the Casco Bay Estuary Partnership programs. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 76 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report CHAPTER 5 WETLANDS Contact: Jeanne DiFranco, DEP BLWQ, Division of Related REGULATION EPA Contact: Jeanne Voorhees, EPA Region I, Office of Ecosystem Protection Tel: (617) 918-1686 email: voorhees.jeanne@SPAM-ZAPepa.gov Related Website: (EPA) www.epa.gov/owow/wetlands/regs/ ACE Ruth England Regulatory Tel: 318-8818 email: ruth.m.ladd@SPAM-ZAPusace.army.mil Related Website: (ACE) www.usace.army.mil/inet/functions/cw/cecwo/reg/index.htm Lead Agencies: EPA Region I and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers (ACE) - Maine Project Office The Clean Water Act provides for wetland protection and regulation through a number of federal programs, most of which are administered by EPA.

(NRPA) and Chapter 310 Wetlands and Waterbodies Protection Rules. Additional information on the DEP wetlands regulatory program is available at the above web site. New Initiatives: As of September 1, 2007, significant vernal pool habitat is protected by law under the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA). Vernal pools or \"spring pools\" are shallow depressions that usually contain water for only part of the year. \"Significant vernal Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 77 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report pools\" are a subset of vernal pools with particularly valuable habitat. More information is available on the DEP web site at: http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/nrpa/vernalpools/fs-vernal_pools_intro.htm . Recognizing the value of specific bird habi tats to the State's environment and quality of life, the Maine Legislature determined that these habitats warranted protection under the Natural Resources Protection Act (NRPA) in 1988 as \"Significant Wildlife Habitats\". After 10 years of data collection and 2 years of legislative review to complete the development of habitat screening maps and additional rulemaking, the DEP began regulating activities \"in, on or over\" valuable waterfowl and wading bird habitat and shorebird feeding and roosting areas on June 8, 2006. Additional modifications to these regulations were effective June 14, 2007. Copies of the rules that define these habitats and establish licensing criteria (\"Chapter 335, Significant Wildlife Habitat\") are available by mail or on the internet at MaineDEP.com under keyword \"NRPA.\" A DEP fact sheet is also available at http://www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/docstand/nrpa/birdhabitat/bird_habitat.htm .

Section 361-A, and are further defined as either \"fresh surface waters\" or \"estuarine and marine waters\". As waters of the State, wetlands are subject to all pertinent provisions of the Maine Water Classification Law, including designated uses, narrative biological criteria and the State's anti-degradation policy. The Maine DEP Biological Monitoring Program is currently developing wetland-specific biological criteria based on tiered aquatic life uses to refine the State's capability to evaluate wetland condition. DEP is also in the process of clarifying how existing criteria apply to wetlands. This will allow the Department to report on attainment status for wetlands in the future.

The Biomonitoring Program is responsible for implementing core wetland program elements related to monitoring and assessment and water quality standards as required under the Clean Water Act. The program also addresses State priorities in the Maine Wetland Conservation Plan and DEP Performance Partnership Agreement. Wetland biomonitoring is coordinated with the State's river and stream biomonitoring program using a 5-year rotating basin schedule. DEP conducts wetland site assessments using biological monitoring, which includes sampling for aquatic macroinvertebrates, epiphytic algae and phytoplankton. Associated physical and chemical data are obtained through field measurements and analysis of water samples. Habitat descriptions, Cowardin classification, hydrogeomorphic setting, substrate, and dominant plant species/community type are also documented. In addition, the DEP Biomonitoring Program uses a Human Disturbance Score as part of a rapid assessment of wetland condition. This information is used to characterize relative levels of human disturbance for biological metric development, identify sources and causes of degradation, and verify that candidate reference wetlands are actually minimally-disturbed. In 2006, DEP conducted biological monitoring and assessment of 22 wetland stations in the Penobscot, St. Croix and down east coastal watersheds. DEP staff partnered with monitoring staff of the Penobscot Indian Nation and the Passamaquoddy Tribe to identify sites of tribal concern in the target watersheds. The DEP Biomonitoring Unit provided training in wetland monitoring methods for both tribes, and tribal members assisted the Unit with wetland field work. DEP also collaborated with staff of the Moosehorn and Sunkhaze Meadows National Wildlife Reserves to select wetland biomonitoring stations within reserve lands. In 2007, the Biological Monitoring Program conducted monitoring and assessment of 23 wetland stations in the Kennebec River watershed.

Prev iously, wetland loss data were kept in a separate database. In addition to the wetlands loss data such as wetland type, size of area lost, etc, GOAT allows wetland loss to be tied to the tax lot using GIS. Because of staff and budget cuts, wetlands loss tracking up until now has been inconsistent, making reporting of losses less than complete. LURC anticipates in coming years to be able to generate realistic reports on wetland losses in the unorganized townships and territories. Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 82 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report CHAPTER 6 GROUNDWATER MONITORING & ASSESSMENTS Contact: Marianne DuBois, DEP BLWQ, Division of Environmental Marianne.S.DuBois@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/blwq/gw.htm Overview Maine's groundwater may be threatened by contamination, particularly in unforested areas, which comprise approximately 11% of the State. Important sources of groundwater contamination in Maine include disposal activities such as landfills and septic systems, leaking storage facilities, agriculture, and sites contaminated with spilled hazardous materials or by previously unregulated activities. Generally, the ground water supply in Maine is adequate. The total withdrawal of ground water by all water users is less than one percent of the annual ground water recharge each year. The remaining annual ground water recharge is lost through evapotranspiration or discharges to ponds, lakes, rivers, and streams. Seasonal variations in water tables can lead to local ground water shortages. The Maine Drought Task Force (convened by the Ma ine Emergency Management Agency) publishes information on Maine ground water and surface water levels at the following website: www.maine.gov/mema/drought Ground water is withdrawn from three basic ty pes of aquifers in Maine: unconsolidated glaciofluvial deposits (stratified drift or sand and gravel aquifers), till, and fractured bedrock. The stratified drift deposits are the most favorable for development of large volume water supply wells, but these deposits are limited in size and distribution (less than about 10% of the state). Discontinuous bedrock aquifers underlie the entire state and are used for domestic, commercial, industrial and agricultural purposes, and for small public supplies such as schools, restaurants, and summer camps. Wells in till do not generally yield large quantities of water and are most often used for individual domestic water supplies. Background The protection of Maine ground water is an issue of concern at all levels of government. Serious ground water pollution problems that have occurred throughout the State and elsewhere have heightened the need for protecting ground water supplies. A few municipalities and regional planning agencies have conducted ground water quality assessment studies, but programs for comprehensive assessment of the quality of ground water resources are needed. Maine's ground water protection programs (Table 6-1) emphasize three areas of effort: 1. State interagency coordination of ground water programs; 2. Assessment of ground water protection problems, including enhancement of the Environmental Groundwater Assessment Database (EGAD); and 3. Statutory changes and building upon implemented state ground water protection programs to increase ground water protection and risk reduction. Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 83 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Please refer to page 124 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for a table of State groundwater protection programs. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Assessment of Ground Water Quality In Maine, ground water is classified by its suitability for drinking water purposes. Under the Maine Water Classification Program, ground water is classified as either potable (GW-A) or unpotable (GW-B). Water is unpotable when the concentrations of chemical compounds detected exceed either the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) or the Maximum Exposure Guidelines (MEG) as defined in the Rules Relating to Drinking Water administered by the Maine D epartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Although there are many localities where ground water is unpotable and highly contaminated, no ground water is currently classified GW-B. The state is not currently attempting to designate non-attainment areas. AQUIFER CHARACTERIZATION ACTIVITIES Contact: Tom Weddle, DOC BGNA, Maine Geological Survey, Applied Geology Division Director, Section Tel: (207) (MGS) is at the \"average characteristics\" stage in characterizing the physical and chemical attributes of the State's stratified drift aquifers. While site specific data do exist for some aquifers (primarily in the vicinity of ground water resource evaluation projects and contamination sites), complete physical pictures of most aquifer systems do not exist. Hard data on the exact natural chemical processes controlling ground water chemical evolution that occur along a flow path in sand and gravel aquifers are also lacking. MGS has some ambient water quality data but has not yet fully characterized any particular aquifer system. Please refer to page 126 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further discussion of aquifer characterization activities. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm OVERVIEW OF GROUND WATER CONTAMINATION SOURCES Most ground water contamination in Maine originates from nonpoint source pollution rather than point source pollution. The following discussion focuses primarily on nonpoint contamination sources that appear to be responsible for most ground water contamination in the State: agriculture, hazardous substance sites, spill sites, landfills, leaking underground storage tanks, septic systems, and shallow well injection. Please refer to the 2006 report beginning on page 127 for additional background information on other sources of contamination, and for additional information on the sources listed above. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 84 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Petroleum Storage Tanks and Product Spills UNDERGROUND TANKS Contact: Bruce Hunter, DEP BRWM, Division of Technical Services 287-7672 email: Bruce.E.Hunter@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Websites: (General Information) www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/ust/ (Rules for UST Facilities) www.maine.gov/sos/cec/rules/06/096/096c691.doc LEAKING UNDERGROUND TANKS AND DRINKING WATER WELLS The Leaking Underground Storage Tank (LUST) Remediation Priority List tracks clean-up sites and provides an objective scoring system to determine which sites receive scarce clean-up dollars. In general, the higher the score, the more quickly resources are allocated to clean up a site. Table 6-1 shows the number of sites placed on this Priority List and the change since the previous 305b report.

Many of the sites on the priori ty list are home heating oil tanks. Which are typically aboveground storage tanks (ASTs). Table 6-2 shows the number of private water wells and public water supplies contaminated by petroleum products or threatened with contamination by petroleum products as of February 2008. Note that one active site can contaminate or threaten more than one well.

Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 85 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report ABOVE GROUND STORAGE TANKS Contact: David McCaskill, DEP BRWM David.McCaskill@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/abovegroundtanks ABOVE GROUND STORAGE TANK SPILL INFORMATION Maine averages over one heating oil spill per day from ASTs at single family residences (See Figure 6-1). One reason for this statistic is that ASTs are commonly used in Maine. The 2000 U.S. Census figures show that 80% of Maine households are heated with oil. The vast majority of these households have 275 gallon ASTs located either in the basement or outside the residence. Please refer to page 128 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further information on aboveground storage tanks in Maine. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm NEW LEGISLATION REQUIRES THE REGISTRATION OF UNDERGROUND PIPING THAT IS CONNECTED TO ABOVEGROUND MOTOR FUEL TANKS In 2006, the Maine Legislature adopted a law that establishes new requirements for facilities with aboveground tanks storing motor fuel (gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, aviation gasoline, jet fuel, gasohol or other fuels used in the operation of a vehicle or motor engine) and that are connected to underground piping. The law establishes annual registration and annual inspection requirements very similar to those of USTs for this class of ASTs. All motor fuel ASTs (except for diesel tanks) with underground piping must be registered by 1 January 2007 and be inspected by 1 July 2007. Diesel tanks have an extra 2 years to meet these requirements. (Register by 1 January 2009, and inspect by 1 July 2009.) Further, by 1 January 2011, all pre-June 24, 1991 underground piping systems at all motor fuel ASTs must meet the current DEP's leak detection standards. This closes an important loophole that allowed pre-June-1991 underground piping, such as single wall, pressurized piping, to remain in the ground. As of the end of 2007, 127 AST facilities with underground piping storing motor fuel (not including diesel fuel) have registered their facilities with DEP; 72 of these have submitted the required annual inspection.

The State SPCC statute also mandated that the DEP provide education and outreach to affected facility owners to encourage their compliance with the federal SPCC rules. Please refer to page 129-130 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for further information on the SPCC Program. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Oil or Hazardous Materials Spills Contact: Lyle Hall, DEP BRWM, Division of Program Services Tel: (207) 287-7499 Lyle.S.Hall@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Websites: (Database Report) www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/publications/ pdf/2004statisticalreportfinal.pdf The DEP BRWM Response Division responded to approximately 2,968 reports of oil or hazardous material events between January of 2006 and December of 2006. Of these events, 467 do not have completed reports and, therefore, are not included in this discussion. An estimated 86% of these responses involved discharges of petroleum products to soil and/or groundwater. During this period, response services personnel discovered over 39 wells that had been contaminated from these spills. Due to further investigation and report completion, these figures are subject to change. Table 6-3 provides information on the 2,501 spills that had completed spill reports.

The agricultural community uses chemicals for pest contro l and weed eradication; in addition, many farmers apply chemical fertilizers and manure to their agricultural lands. These are all major potential sources of ground water contamination. The major areas of chemical application include potato fields in Aroostook County, blueberry barrens in Hancock and Washington Counties, and apple orchards and forage cropland in Central Maine. Pesticides and nitrates are the main categories of agricultural ground water contaminants. MAINE'S NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT LAW Contact: Mark Hedrich, Nutrient Management Coordinator, Maine Department of Agriculture, Division of Animal Health and Industry Tel: (207) 287-7608 email: Mark.Hedrich@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: http://www.maine.gov/agriculture/narr/nutrientmanagement.html Please refer to page 131 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for more information on the Maine Nutrient Management Program. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm Impacts of the Law: Implementing nutrient management on farms can better protect ground and surface water. By applying manure and other nutrients only in the amounts needed for crop production and in a way that will consider nearby sensitive resources, fewer nutrients will leave the site and impact water quality. Studies of Maine farms where nutrient management pr actices have been implemented show that water quality within a watershed can be significantly improved.

The Division of Remediation investigates and mitigates the risk posed to public health and the environment from these sites. The Department may undertake the investigation and clean-up themselves, but more often compels potential responsible parties to undertake the work, through either the states uncontrolled sites program (for smaller sites) or via one of two federal programs: the federal RCRA program for recently operated sites, or the CERCLA program (the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response and Comprehensive Liability Act, aka Superfund) at sites where operators are not longer viable. Additionally, many sites are investigated and remediated under one of two voluntary programs: the Brownfields Program, which partially funds the work with federal dollars, and Maine's Voluntary Remedial Action Program (VRAP) or.

This responsibility rests with DHHS because the treatment and disposal of human sanitary waste has been historically considered a public health issue. The Subsurface Wastewater Program within the Division of Environmental Health promulgates and administers the Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules. The Program also maintains microfiche copies of all plumbing and subsurface wastewater permits that have been issued statewide from 1974 to the present. During the 2006 fiscal year, the Program processed 12,000 internal plumbing and 10,000 subsurface wastewater permits. NITRATES AND SEPTIC SYSTEMS The Health and Environmental Testing Laboratory (HETL) database contains the results of water tests done on private wells. This database provides the largest sample of private well nitrate concentrations in the state. Assuming that the HETL database for nitrate-N represents Maine ground water quality, data from January 2006 to May 2007 indicate approximately 98% of wells sampled have concentrations below 5 mg/L, well below the 10 mg/L drinking water standard for nitrate-N (Table 6-9). This percentage has remained steady for the past few reporting cycles. Table 6-6 Nitrate-N Frequency 93.7 2.51 to 5.00 5.6 6.0 4.5 5.01 to 7.50 2.0 2.0 1.1 7.51 to 10.00 0.5 0.4 0.5 Greater than 10.0 0.0 0.6 0.2 Number of Analyses 2,197 3,638 7,100 1HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/04 and 5/31/05. 2HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/02 and 12/31/03. 3HETL database for private well analyses between 1/1/06 and 5/31/07. BACTERIA Private well testing for bacteria identifies a greater contamination potential from bacteria than from nitrate. In public and private drinking water supplies, coliform bacteria are used as the indicator of microbial contamination. The Primary Drinking Water Standard for total coliform bacteria is 0 colonies per 100 ml. Maine DEP 2006 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 93 2006 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Table 6-7 shows that larger percentages of dug wells test positive for bacteria than drilled wells. This lends support to the belief that dug wells are more susceptible to bacterial contamination than drilled wells.

Wells shown are those which were sampled. For 2008 the ambient ground water quality monitoring network consists of 2,665 public water supplies. Each of the selected public water supplies is provided by only one source of water: either a drilled well in bedrock; a dug well in glacial till; a drilled well, well point, or dug well in glacial outwash sand and gravel or recent sandy alluvium (Figure 6-2). Some of the wells are large community water supplies; some are non-transient, non-community water supplies. Analytical results for periodic, routine sampling of raw water were provided by the DWP. Not all the well samples were analyzed for the all the same chemical constituents every time they were obtained: frequency depends on the type of water supply and the population served. Nevertheless, the DEP believes that the selection represents ambient ground water quality in the three major geologic settings that provide ground water in Maine. Sand and gravel aquifers are often high yield water sources and are often found in developed areas, and are therefore vulnerable to contamination. Bedrock aquifers, though not usually hydrologically connected, underlie the whole state and are mostly used as private water supplies, as are glacial till aquifers. The locations of the wells used to indicate ambient water quality are shown in Figure 6-3 and a summary of the ambient water quality data is in Table 6-9. Figure 6-2 shows the distribution of these wells by aquifer type.

These programs stress contamination prevention rather than remediation.

The Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) has focused on ensuring that areas influenced by licensed discharges are not a threat to swimmer health. All participants in the Maine Healthy Beaches Program (MHB), including State Parks, conduct routine monitoring of beach water quality on a weekly basis from Memorial Day through Labor Day. When exceedances occur, resampling is conducted for those sites. Private beach owners are responsible for their own monitoring programs unless they are working with the municipality and Maine Healthy Beaches , but often private beaches do not conduct any monitoring at all. In Maine, the monitoring of town owned beaches and providing public notification is the jurisdiction of the municipality. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health (BEACH) Act of 2000 in response to the growing concern about public health risks posed by polluted coastal swimming beaches. The Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 100 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Maine Healthy Beaches Program (MHB) is a voluntary program and includes these components: water quality assessment and public notification of beach status, education and outreach, and working with communities and program partners to identify and remediate pollution sources through applied research and special studies. The assessment program includes measurement of critical factors that affect the health of the beach environment as well as the health of people who visit them (for participating beaches only).

Beaches can be closed or posted to warn of health risks; both methods use some form of risk analysis. Beach advisories are posted according to: Results obtained from bacteria water quality samples exceeding State and Federal standards. Conditions at sample site indicating the possible presence of disease-causing organisms. These advisories are recommendations to the public to avoid water contact activities at the beach until further analyses reveal safe conditions. A beach closure closes the beach to water contact. Closures are based on a number of factors (Risk-Based Assessment Matrix): bacterial count, bather numbers, time of last rainfall, and history of known probl ems. This is a coordinated decision between the Beach Manager, Town official/State Park Director, and Program Coordinator.

A goal of the Clean Water Act (CWA) is to have these areas meet their designated use of \"Propagation and Harvest of Shellfish.\" Shellf ish areas are closed by DMR if the area is found to have elevated levels of bacteria or if the area is determined as threatened by potential sewage pollution problems (proximity of wastewater outfalls or intense storm runoff events). Water samples are collected and tested for fecal coliform bacteria at least six (6) times annually from each of the more than 2,000 established sampling sites that are located along the entire Maine coast. The shoreline survey includes a visual inspection of the shoreline to determine the location and magnitude of potential sewage pollution and toxic contamination problems. Table 7-4 presents both the percentage and the total area in acres under each classification. Current calculations estimate that Maine has a total of 1,821,434 acres of tidal flats and coastal waters in this classification system. This number has varied some over the past few 305b reporting cycles because of changes in the underlying data sets that Geographic Information Systems (GIS) use to calculate areas and because of the way DMR designates its shellfish harvesting areas. These changes have made it difficult to accurately dete rmine how much progress has been made in the opening up of additional shellfish harvesting areas.

The toxin is transferred to humans by the ingestion of shellfish that have filtered the organisms into their systems. The toxin affects humans by paralyzing the central nervous system and, in high doses, may cause death. DMR's Biotoxin Monitoring Program monito rs levels of PSP (Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning or \"Red Tide\") and other marine biotoxins in the shellfish and waters of Maine. Shellfish samples are collected statewide between April and October and evaluated at the Biotoxin laboratories in West Boothbay Harbor and Lamoine. When toxin is found approaching quarantine levels, closures of shellfish harvest areas are implemented. Maine has historically had high levels of PSP during the warmer periods of the year. While red tide is a water quality issue, it is not a direct cause and effect relationship with human-caused pollutants. Closures, therefore, are not reported as violations of water quality standards. For information on closures, call DMR's hot line 1-800-232-4733 or 207-633-9571or visit the web at www.maine.gov/dmr/rm/public_health/closures/shellfishhotline.htm The DMR also has an Internet Mapping Site that contains information on Red Tide - the link to that site is here: http://megisims.state.me.us/dmr_redtide/ Ocean Fish and Shellfish Consumption Advisories Contact Andrew Smith, DHHS Maine CDC, Environmental and Occupational Health Program Tel: (207) 287-5189 email: Andy.E.Smith@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/fish/ Waters attain their \"Clean Water Act-designated use for Fishing,\" whenever government agencies issue fish and/or she llfish consumption advisories. These advisories are designed to let citizens know that there may be an increased risk to their health if they choose to consume certain species of fish or shellfish. Since 1992, human health consumption advisories have been in place to warn the public against the consumption of lobster tomalley due to high levels of toxic contaminants. However, no evidence of elevated levels of these contaminants was found in lobster meat. The advisory was expanded to include bluefish and striped bass in 1996, also due to detection of elevated levels of toxic contaminants in their flesh. The entire Maine coast is only in partial support of its designated use for fishing due to these consumption advisories. Toxic contaminati on found in lobster tomalley is presumed to originate in Maine waters, which leads to their listing in Category 5-D for non- attainment due to legacy pollutants. Toxic contaminants found in migratory or pelusic Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 105 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report finfish are presumed to have been acquired largely outside of Maine waters where the fish spend most of their lives. Thus advisories for marine finfish are not listed as causes of non-attainment. ADVISORY OVERVIEW Current information, with a last revision date of February 20, 2001, on ocean fish and shellfish advisories as adapted from the Maine CDC is as follows: WARNING About Eating Saltwater Fish and Lobster Tomalley Warning: Chemicals in some Maine saltwater fish and lobster tomalley may harm people who eat them. Women who are or may become pregnant and children should carefully follow the Safe Eating Guidelines. It's hard to believe fish that looks, smells, and tastes fine may not be safe to eat. But the truth is that some saltwater fish have mercury, PCBs and Dioxins in them. All these chemicals settle into the ocean from the air. PCBs and Dioxins also flow into the ocean through our rivers. These chemicals then build up in fish. Small amounts of mercury can damage a brain starting to form or grow. That's why babies in the womb, nursing babies, and young children are at most risk. Mercury can also harm older children and adults, but it takes larger amounts. PCBs and Dioxins can cause cancer and other health problems if too much builds up in your body. Since some saltwater fish contain several chemicals, we ask that all consumers of the following saltwater species follow the safe eating guidelines. SPECIFIC OCEAN FISH CONSUMPTION ADVISORIES SAFE EATING GUIDELINES Striped Bass and Bluefish: Recommended to eat no more than 2 meals per month. Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, and Tilefish: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age are advised to not eat any swordfish or shark. All other individuals should eat no more than 2 meals per month. Canned Tuna: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age should eat no more than 1 can of \"white\" tuna or 2 cans of \"light\" tuna per week. All other ocean fish and shellfish, including canned fish and shellfish: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant and children under 8 years of age should eat no more than 2 meals per week. LOBSTER MEAT AND TOMALLEY CONSUMPTION ADVISORIES Lobster Meat: Consumption advisories do not exist for lobster meat. Lobster Tomalley: Recommended to completely avoid consumption of lobster tomalley. While there is no known safety considerations when it comes to eating Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 106 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report lobster meat, consumers are advised to refrain from eating the tomalley. The tomalley is the soft, green substance found in the body cavity of the lobster that functions as the liver and pancreas. Test results have shown that the tomalley can accumulate contaminants found in the environment. For more information, including warnings on freshwater fish call (866) 292-3474 or visit the related web site at: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp Freshwater Fish Consumption Monitoring, Assessments and Advisories Contact: Barry Mower, DEP BLWQ, Division of email: Barry.F.Mower@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/dioxin/ In addition to marine fish and shellfish, DEP monitors freshwater fish in its Dioxin Monitoring Program and Surface Waters Ambient Toxics (SWAT) monitoring program for contaminants that may present a risk for human consumption. The results are forwarded to the MCDC who is responsible for recommending the warnings on eating fish based on the presence of chemicals (MSRA 22 \u00df 1696 I) . MCDC does so in the form of Fish Consumption Advisories, which can be seen with additional information at http://www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/fish/ . There is a statewide Fish Consumption Advisory for all freshwaters because of mercury and additional advisories for specific waters because of other contaminants. MERCURY STATEWIDE FISH CONSUMPTION ADVISORY Based on monitoring of mercury concentrations in freshwater fish from all over Maine, the Maine Bureau of Health (now MCDC) issued a statewide advisory for all Maine lakes and ponds in 1994 and expanded it to include all freshwaters in 1997 as follows: Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant, and children under age 8 SHOULD NOT EAT any freshwater fish from Maine's inland waters. Except, for brook trout and landlocked salmon, 1 meal per month is safe. All other adults and children older than 8 CAN EAT 2 freshwater fish meals per month. For brook trout and landlocked salmon, the limit is 1 meal per week. DIOXIN Dioxin levels in fish from Maine rivers continue to decline, approaching background at some locations but still exceeding background at others. An evaluation of the need for fish consumption advisories due to the presence of dioxin-like compounds in fish requires a comparison to a health benchmark. The ME-CDC uses a health benchmark that is expressed as a toxicity-weighted concentration of dioxin-like compounds in fish tissue, referred to as a \"Fish Tissue Action Level\" or FTAL. For the present report, the ME-CDC compares the most recent data on contaminant levels to its current FTA Ls for dioxin-like compounds of 1.5 parts Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 107 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report per trillion (ppt) for protection of cancer-related effects and a 0.4 parts per trillion FTAL for protection of noncancer related effects. The FTAL of 1.5 ppt for cancer related effects has been used by ME-CDC since 1990. The FTAL of 0.4 ppt for noncancer effects is based on the same toxicity data relied upon since 1990, but has been adjusted downward to account for the substantial background exposure we all get from the presence of these chemicals in most dietary foods. The ME-CDC has evaluated recent data that can be seen at http://mainegov-images.informe.org/dep/bl wq/docmonitoring/dioxin/report_2007.pdf RIVER AND STREAM SPECIFIC FISH CONSUMPTION ADVISORIES The dominant causes for the following fish consumption advisories are identified as dioxin/furans/coplanar PCBs, total PCBs, and total DDTs (DDD + DDE + DDT). ME- CDC is currently reviewing all the fish c ontaminant data since 2003 and expects any revisions to the fish consumption advisories to be issued in spring 2008. Current advisories are listed on next page. Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 108 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Department of Health and Human Servi ces Guidelines about Eating Freshwater Fish Warning: Mercury in Maine freshwater fish may harm th e babies of pregnant and nursing mothers, and young children. SAFE EATING GUIDELINES Pregnant and nursing women, women who may get pregnant, and children under age 8 SHOULD NOT EAT any freshwater fish from Ma ine's inland waters. Except, for brook trout and landlocked salmon, 1 meal per month is safe. All other adults and children older than 8 CAN EAT 2 freshwater fish meals per month. For brook trout and landlocked salmon, the limit is 1 meal per week. It's hard to believe that fish that looks, smells, and tastes fine may not be safe to eat. But the truth is that fish in Maine lakes, ponds, and rivers have mercury in them. Other states have this problem too. Mercury in the air settles into the waters. It then builds up in fish. For this reason, older fish have higher levels of mercury than youn ger fish. Fish (like pickerel and bass) that eat other fish have the highest mercury levels. Small amounts of mercury can harm a brain starting to form or grow. That is why unborn and nursing babies and young children are most at risk. Too much mercury can affect behavior and learning. Mercury can harm older children and adul ts, but it takes larger amounts. It may cause numbness in hands and feet or changes in vision. The Safe Eating Guidelines identify limits to protect everyone. Warning: Some Maine waters are polluted, requiring additional limits to eating fish. Fish caught in some Maine waters have high le vels of PCBs, Dioxins or DDT in them. These chemicals can cause cancer and other health effects. The Bureau of Health recommends additional fish consumption limits on the waters listed below. Remember to check the mercury guidelines. If the water you are fishing is lis ted below, check the mercury guideline above and follow the most limiting guidelines.

Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 109 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Ground Water and Public Health Concerns PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS Contaminants found in ground water have numerous adverse human health and environmental impacts. Public health concerns arise because some of the contaminants are individually linked to numerous toxic effects ranging from allergic reactions and respiratory impairment to liver and kidney damage, and damage to the central nervous system. Additional public health concerns also arise because information is not available about the health impacts of many contaminants found in ground water. Due to uncertainties in the relationships between exposure to contaminants and impacts on human health, public health efforts are based on identifying the probabilities of impacts (i.e. risk assessm ent). Conducting a risk assessment for combinations of contaminants that are commonly found in ground water is difficult because there are no generally accepted protocols for testing the effects of contaminant interactions. The primary route of exposure to contaminants is through ingestion of drinking water, although exposure is also possible through contact with skin and inhalation of vapors from ground water sources (bathing, food preparation, industrial processes, etc.) Because ground water generally provides base flow to streams and rivers, environmental impacts include toxic effects on benthic invertebrates, fish, wildlife and aquatic vegetation. This also presents a public health concern if the surface waterbody is a source of food and recreation. In some areas of the State there are probably links between low-level, long-term ground water quality degradation and the water quality of streams and brooks during low-flow conditions.

The WHPP continues to be a voluntary program for Maine's public water suppliers, with all reduced or waived monitoring tied to approved protection programs. To be eligible for reduced or waived monitoring, a system must have an approved local Wellhead Protection Plan (WHPP) and have completed a waiver application.

Protecting a water supply source has long been recognized as the cornerstone of providing safe drinking water. The most effective source protection method is to keep the area contributing water to the supply open and undeveloped. The Maine Drinking Water Program's (DWP) recently completed five year assessment of source protection for public water supplies identified rapid residential and commercial development in source protection areas as the most significant threat to water quality and quantity, and few water suppliers are prepared to deal with these risks. Public Water Systems (PWS) have a very limit ed suite of tools for source protection: they can purchase land, inspect existing activities, and ask local government to enact (and enforce) protective ordinances. Only one in five of Maine's community water systems have effective source protection plans in place after more than fifteen years of encouragement and incentives. FINISHED WATERS Contact: Lindy Moceus, DHHS Maine CDC, Divi sion email: Lindy.Moceus@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eng/water/Templates/S ections/Compliance/Compliance.htm The Water Program (DWP) is the front line enforcement agent of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for the rules and regulations set forth in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA). The requirements of SDWA apply to the approximately 2,000 public drinking water systems in Maine. There are 80 water systems that use surface water as their primary source and these all have water treatment systems and watershed protecti on programs. Of the approximately 1,920 ground water systems, 661 have some form of treatment on-line while the remaining systems have no treatment and serve raw water. Water testing on finished water is the primary means for assessing public water system compliance while verifying the quality of water that is reaching consumers. PRIVATE WELLS Contact Andrew Smith, DHHS Maine CDC, Environmental and Occupational Health Program Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 111 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report Tel: (207) 287-5189 email: Andy.E.Smith@SPAM-ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dhhs/eohp/wells/ The State of Maine has one of the highest per capita uses of domestic household wells for drinking water in the U.S. Based on data from Maine's 2003 Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), 52 percent of the state's population relies on private domestic wells for their drinking water. Despite the fact that the majority of Maine residents obtain their drinking water from private household wells, the State does not have an environmental health services program focused on meeting the needs of private well owners. Please refer to pages 162-167 of the 2006 Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report for additional information on Maine's Wellhead Protection and Source Water Protection Programs, and Finished Water and Private Well information. http://www.state.me.us/dep/blwq/docmonitoring/305b/index.htm MTBE Contacts: DEP BRWM Geological Survey 207-287-2801; or the U.S. Geological Survey, 207-622-8201 Related Websites: (General Information) www.maine.gov/dep/mtbe.htm (Questions and Answers) www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/publications/mtbeqa.htm MTBE or methyl tert-butyl ether is an additive used in gasoline since the late 1970's to replace lead. It makes up about 3% of regular unleaded gasoline and 11% of reformulated gas (RFG). To meet federal clean air requirements, Maine began using RFG in November of 1994. There has been evidence of MTBE in ground water since before 1985. However, no widespread contamination was noted until 1998, when a series of gasoline contamination incidents and concurrent public concern caused the State of Maine to conduct a study of private and public water supply wells. Of the 951 private wells and 793 public water supply wells tested: 93% showed either no MTBE or trace levels (below 1ppb). 16% showed detectable levels of MTBE, while other gasoline constituents were rarely found. While no public water supplies in the study showed MTBE levels above the MCL; 1% of the private wells sampled did show le vels above the MCL of 35 ppb. The DEP's 1998 investigations of the wells with MTBE levels over the MCL indicated an association with relatively small gasoline spills that one might categorize as a \"backyard\" type of spill - e.g. small, accidental spills that occur while filling the gas tanks of an ATV, snowmobile, garden tractor, etc. Legislation was approved on Apr. 14, 2004 to prohibit the sale of Gasoline containing MTBE. The prohibition reads \"Beginning January 1, 2007 a person may not sell, offer for sale, distribute or blend in this State gasoline that contains more than 1/2 of 1% by volume MTBE that is intended for sale to ultimate consumers in this State.\" We are still cleaning up sites, but the amount of MTBE we are finding in groundwater is not as much as we had when using RFG.

The presence of naturally occurring radioactive radon gas in ground water drawn from granite bedrock aquifers and overlying soils has long been recognized as a problem in Maine. Based on studies of miners and more recently on people living in homes with high radon concentrations, medical researchers have shown that high radon levels in air are associated with increased incidence of lung cancer. Radon in water supplies is a concern because radon is readily released into the air from water. Therefore the health concerns stems more from inhalation of the radon rather than drinking the water. A large number of Maine wells have radon concentrations that through normal household water use, release concentrations of radon into the air that are as high or higher than the concentrations associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer. Proposed federal standards for radon have raised concerns regarding ground water that had previously been regarded as acceptable. The average concentration of radon in public or private water supplies in Maine ranges from 5,000 to 10,000 picocuries/Liter (pci/L). Current Maine guidelines limit radon in water to 20,000 pci/L. The proposed federal standard would create a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for radon in water of 300 pci/L with an Alternate MCL (AMCL) of 4,000 pci/L if a radon multimedia mitigation program is developed and instituted by the State or the community water suppliers. This multimedia mitigation plan would require reducing risks from radon in indoor air, which is estimated to cause 14,000 to 32,000 deaths annually in the U.S., compared to radon in drinking water which is estimated to cause 68 deaths annually. The AMCL of 4,000 pci/L was chosen because it is the amount of radon in drinking water that causes a risk equal to the risk from radon found in outdoor air. Statutory authority for the MCL, AMCL and multimedia mitigation plans were set in the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996.

The current Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) for arsenic is 50 ppb (parts per billion); however the EPA has recently proposed lowering the MCL to 10 ppb in drinking water. The Maine Bureau of Health has set a maximum exposure guideline (MEG) for arsenic in domestic well water at 0.01 milligrams of arsenic per liter of water (which is equal to 10 ppb). This is also the same amount that the World Health Organization currently recommends. A 1994 - 1995 study of about 600 randomly selected wells indicates that, statewide, about 1 to 2 percent have arsenic levels greater than 50 ppb. However, about 10 percent have arsenic levels above the MEG of 10 ppb. Currently a source or sources for all arsenic detected in well water has not been determined. However, preliminary work by the MGS, University of Maine Department of Geological Sciences, DEP, and DHHS indicate that the problem is of statewide significance and that the arsenic concentration in ground water is most likely the result of both natural processes and human activity. 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report CHAPTER 8 SUMMARY OF IMPAIRED WATERS Table 8-1 presents specific Causes of impairment that have been removed from the 2002, 2004 and 2006 lists of Impaired Waters (the\"303d List\") for the specified river and stream segments.

Environmental and Geograpic Analysis Database (EGAD) Contact: Chris Halsted, EGAD Programmer/Analyst, Mark.K.Holden@SPAM- ZAPmaine.gov Related Website: www.maine.gov/dep/rwm/egad/ The Maine Environmental and Geographic Analysis Database (EGAD) stores site and water quality information in a relational database using Oracle technology and spatial locations using Environmental Systems Res earch Institute (ESRI) Spatial Database Engine (SDE) software. The database includes data from groundwater and surface water samples as well as sediment and biological samples and other pertinent information. To date (February 2008), data from the MDEP Biological Monitoring, SWAT (Surface Water Ambient Toxics) and Dioxin Monitoring programs have been fully incorporated into EGAD; data from the Marine Monitoring and Lakes Assessment programs have been partly incorporated. Database functionalities exist to assess trends in water quality information, satisfy requests for data, assist in answering inquiries, provide automated analysis, reporting and map-making capability, and achieve rapid access to information for emergency response for hazardous materials spills. The EGAD system also allows complete integration of all data via spatial relationships. Water quality assessment results are stored in Maine's version of the EPA Assessment Database (ADB). MDEP envisions that all raw water quality data, in support of the Integrated Report will ultimately be stored in the EGAD database with a GIS-facilitated link to ADB assessments. By the end of 2008 EGAD will have upload links established to port Maine water quality data into the national EPA database, WQX. Addi tionally public access to Maine data will soon take a significant step forward by utilizing a Google Earth platform to geo-locate and browse Maine surface and ground water data via the Internet. Graphic Analysis of groundwater-related data (time trend parameter analysis, etc.) can be done as well or in conjunction with mapping. Having immediate access saves time allowing for good municipal planning for wellhead protection and designation, selection Maine DEP 2008 305(b) Report and 303(d) List 146 2008 Maine Integrated Water Quality Report of data for analysis by the DEP, and export in response to requests. There are over 16,000 sites in the database, approximately 10,000 sample points as well as over 6 million lab analysis records. The database now includes surface water data which is discussed in another section of this report. There are many different Site Types (see related web site above). The common format of the EDD (Electronic Data Deliverable) permits quality control of large amounts of analyte data and associated which is submitted from laboratories. Approximately 1000 groundwater sites are added every year. LISTINGS ON INDIVIDUAL WATERS See Appendices II through IV (separate document) for listing information on specific waters.
