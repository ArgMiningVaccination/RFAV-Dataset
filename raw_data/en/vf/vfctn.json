INTRODUCTION It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble, it's what you know for sure that just ain't so.1 ommercial website publishers use false and misleading information to create distrust of vaccines by claiming vaccines2 are unnecessary, and cause autism and other disorders.3The misinformation has decreased childhood vaccination rates and imperiled the public by allowing a resurgence of vaccine-preventable illnesses.4 In lieu of vaccines, the websites offer for sale alternative products that lack any medically active ingredients or effects.5 This Article argues that tort liability attaches to publishers of commercial websites for foreseeable harm that results when websites dissuade parents from vaccinating their children in favor of purchasing products offered for sale on the websites. This Article contends that viable tort actions may be grounded in the Restatement (Second) of Torts, sections 310,6 311,7 525,8 and 552,9 1 Nigel Rees, Policing Word Abuse, FORBES (Aug. 13, 2009, 6:00 PM), http://www.forbes.com/2009/08/12/nigel-rees-misquotes-opinions-rees.html [http://perma.cc/Z8NX-PXLN]. 2 In this Article, \"immunize\" and \"immunization\" have the same meaning and are used interchangeably with \"vaccinate\" and \"vaccination,\" respectively. Likewise, the terms \"disease\" and \"illness\" are used as synonyms. 3 Eve Dub\u00e9 et al., Vaccine Hesitancy, 9 HUM. VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS 1763, 1765-66 (2013). 4 Id.; Robert M.

Specifically, sections 310 and 525 allow plaintiffs to claim fraud through intentional or reckless misrepresentation; sections 311 and 552 allow plaintiffs to allege negligent misrepresentation. Potential victim-plaintiffs include (1) voluntarily unvaccinated children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease, (2) persons who contract a vaccine-preventable disease from a voluntarily unvaccinated person, and (3) parents of children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease. Although others may be harmed consequent to a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak, these three categories represent the first tier of those who would be harmed by the outbreak and most likely to bring a successful tort action for misrepresentation.

Part III\u2014Autism and Other Vaccine Mythoi\u2014will examine the fraudulent yet highly publicized \"studies\" that have cast vaccines in a negative light, decreased public confidence in them, and resulted in a critical decrease in childhood vaccination rates. Part IV\u2014The Impact of Social Media\u2014will discuss predatory website publishers who use the public's decreased vaccine confidence to maintain anti-vaccine fictions while offering \"alternative\" products in lieu of vaccinations. Also discussed will be the negative effects the anti-vaccine movement has had on vaccination rates, the increase in morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable illnesses, and the resultant costs to victims and our communities. Part V\u2014The Law\u2014will discuss viable tort actions aimed at holding publishers of misleading and false information liable for the harm caused to affected parties. Part VI\u2014Conclusion\u2014will summarize the elements of this Article and suggest further avenues for research into liability theories to protect the unwary or gullible public from the effects of misleading commercial websites. 8 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 525 (AM.

VACCINE BACKGROUND One of the brightest chapters in the history of science is the impact of vaccines on human longevity and health.10 A. Historical Perspective \"The invention of vaccination was a turning point in the war between microbes and humans. Although improved sanitation and antibiotics may have saved more lives, vaccines represent the most cost-effective life-saving device in history.\"11 In 1796, Dr. Edward Jenner, a British physician, \"discovered\" vaccination12 when he injected material from a dairymaid infected with cowpox, a disease caused by a virus similar to the smallpox virus, into an eight-year-old boy.13 Several days later\u2014in a procedure that would be a violation of medical ethics today\u2014Jenner inoculated the boy with material from a fresh smallpox lesion and the child did not develop smallpox.14 Despite the success of Jenner's technique in protecting against a terrifying medical threat, protests against its use arose throughout Europe.15 Books were written in opposition and people protested in the streets, but laws were passed in an effort to compel vaccination.16 Public resistance eventually faded in the face of repeated epidemics, yet some protestors continued to refuse vaccination and British law created an exception for \"conscientious objectors.\"17 The United States also saw resistance and controversy surrounding smallpox vaccination. During the 1901 to 1903 smallpox epidemic in 10 Stanley Plotkin, History of Vaccination, 111 PROC. NAT'L ACAD.

Pead, Benjamin Jesty: New Light in the Dawn of Vaccination, 362 THE LANCET 2104, 2104 (2003). Although Edward Jenner has been hailed as the first person to successfully vaccinate against an infectious disease, Benjamin Jesty has recently received recognition for devising the procedure.

J. 430, 430-31 (2002). 16 Id. 17 Id. at 431. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 127 Boston, the Boston Board of Health started a voluntary vaccination program and sequestered infected patients in special quarantine facilities.18 Because the voluntary program was unsuccessful in halting the epidemic, the Board of Health ordered mandatory vaccinations.19 Protests began as residents claimed vaccination was a violation of civil rights and raised concerns about the dangers of the vaccine itself.20 This controversy led to the landmark Jacobson v. Massachusetts case.21 In Jacobson, a citizen challenged the law that allowed the Board of Health to impose fines on those who refused vaccination.22 The Court held that, while the state could not direct vaccination for the protection of a single individual against an infectious disease, the state could, nevertheless, compel that person to be vaccinated for the protection of the public in general as part of the state's police power.23 This decision foreshadowed the concept of herd immunity.24 The Jacobson Court also wrote: \"All laws,\" this court has said, \"should receive a sensible construction. General terms should be so limited in their application as not to lead to injustice, oppression, or an absurd consequence. It will always, therefore, be presumed that the legislature intended exceptions to its language which would avoid results of this character. . . . The reason of the law in such cases should prevail over its letter.\"25 Until otherwise informed by the highest court of Massachusetts, we are not inclined to hold that the statute establishes the absolute rule that an adult must be vaccinated if it be apparent or can be shown with reasonable certainty that he is not at the time a fit subject of vaccination, or that vaccination, by reason of his then condition, would 18 Michael R.

New vaccines and the science of immunology developed slowly over the succeeding years. Vaccines were developed for rabies in 1885, typhoid and cholera in 1896, and plague in 1897.27 Dozens more vaccines were developed during the twentieth century and another ten in the first fifteen years of the twenty-first century.28 Seventeen vaccinations are now routinely recommended for infants, children, and adolescents.29 Several others are available to populations at specific risk of contracting infections that are not a threat to the general population.30 B. Why Vaccinate? Vaccination programs are used to prevent or control vaccine-preventable illnesses to limit \"the disruptive impacts associated with outbreaks of disease on communities, schools, and institutions . . . [and] reduce absences from work for ill persons and for persons caring for sick children, decrease absences from school, and limit health care utilization associated with treatment visits.\"31 The prevalence of childhood and adult vaccine-preventable illnesses has been dramatically reduced. Smallpox has been eradicated worldwide; polio has been eliminated in the U.S. (and most other nations); and 26 Id. at 39. 27 Plotkin, supra note 10, at 12284. 28 Id. 29 Anne Schuchat & Lisa A.

Vaccinations for infants, children, and adolescents include diphtheria, Haemophilus influenza type b, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, human papilloma virus, influenza, measles, meningococcal disease and rubella are combined into a single vaccination known as MMR and diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis are combined into a single vaccination known as DTaP (Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis). Id. 30 Plotkin, supra note 10, at 12284. Additional vaccinations are available for anthrax, cholera, Japanese encephalitis, Lyme disease, plague, rabies, tick-borne encephalitis, and zoster.

How Vaccines Create Immunity in Individuals Vaccines are made from live attenuated (weakened) viruses or parts of viruses or bacteria that cause the illness targeted by the vaccine.34 When administered, a vaccine is recognized by the body as a foreign material.35 The small amount of foreign material in the vaccine stimulates one's immune system to form antibodies36 to the foreign material, creating an immune system \"memory\" of the foreign material in the vaccination.37 Whenever the vaccinated person's immune system detects the same foreign material in the form of an infective virus or bacterium, the immune system recognizes the material as foreign and neutralizes it.38 Because the vaccination primed the immune system response, the response is much greater and more rapid than if the person had never been exposed to the foreign material.39 By this mechanism, individuals become immune to the illnesses that the vaccinations target. Without this immunity, contact with an infectious virus or bacterium would lead to illness because the immune system could not respond rapidly or effectively enough to neutralize the infectious agent. 32 Id. 33 Id. 34 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, Understanding How Vaccines Work, http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/patient-ed/conversations/downloads/vacsafe-understand-color-office.pdf [http://perma.cc/ETK7-75GL] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015); see also Peter J.

Delves & Ivan M. Roitt, The Immune System, 343 NEW ENGL. J. MED. 37 (2000). 36 An antibody is an immune system component that neutralizes infections and other challenges that the immune system interprets as being foreign and, therefore, undesirable. 37 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, supra note 34. 38 Id. 39 Id. 130 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 Not all vaccines produce a sufficient quantity of antibodies in one dose to provide protection. Some vaccines\u2014such as the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) vaccines\u2014require more than one initial dose or additional \"booster\" doses several years after initial vaccination.40 A few vaccines contain an adjuvant chemical that helps the immune system develop a response to the vaccine's viral or bacterial contents.41 This is especially useful for older patients whose immune systems are not as capable as those of younger individuals; therefore, these adjuvants are most useful in vaccines such as influenza, from which an aging population is most at risk.42 Some believe there are few significant adverse effects associated with acquiring a vaccine-preventable illness and, thereby, developing natural immunity. On the contrary, acquiring a vaccine-preventable illness poses significant unnecessary risks of severe morbidity, lifetime disabilities, and death.43 D. Herd immunity: Creating Protection for Populations While vaccinations given to a single person can provide that individual with immunity, they are not 100% effective.44 Additionally, some people cannot be vaccinated. These include the very young,45 people with known sensitivities or allergies to a vaccine component, are pregnant (some vaccines), and those whose immune systems are compromised by immune system illnesses, including certain malignancies, HIV, and other conditions that suppress the immune system's ability to respond appropriately to vaccine challenges.46 40 Id. 41 Seunghoon Han, Clinical Vaccine Development, 4 CLIN.

If enough individuals are vaccinated, the resultant herd immunity will afford some protection to those who cannot be vaccinated. Failure to vaccinate an individual endangers not only that individual, but collectively threatens the integrity of the herd immunity that indirectly protects those who cannot be vaccinated. 47 Paul Fine et al., Herd Immunity, 52 VACCINES 911, 911 (2011). 48 Id. 49 Id. at 911-13. 50 See id. at 913. This rate fluctuates because the infectivity of influenza A varies from year to year depending on the characteristics of each new viral strain. Id. 132 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 III. AUTISM AND OTHER VACCINE MYTHOI Everyone is entitled to his own opinions, not his own facts.51 False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long.52 A. What is autism? The signs and symptoms of autism and related disorders develop during very early childhood and transform an otherwise normal child in whom parents have invested their love and dreams into the inwardly focused and unsociable entity described below. The defining symptoms of autism almost invariably become overt in toddlers and preschoolers. . . . [S]ymptoms may be noted from infancy or become evident after a period of normal or more normal development. There are three key manifestations of autism: 1. Impaired sociability, empathy, and ability to read other people's moods and intentions, with resulting inadequate or inappropriate social interactions. 2. Rigidity and perseveration, including both stereotypies (purposeless repetitive movements and activities), the need for sameness, and resistance to change. 3. Impaired language, communication, and imaginative play. Speech is typically delayed or may regress. Comprehension is impaired, if not at the word level, then at the level of sentences. Nonverbal and verbal language are affected, and pretend play is delayed or absent. Some children are nonverbal or have sparse, impoverished, poorly articulated, and agrammatical speech. A mostly nonverbal child may utter a rare, well-articulated sentence. In other children who have or do not have delayed talking, speech is abundant and 51 CHARLES C. DOYLE ET AL., THE DICTIONARY OF MODERN PROVERBS 185 (2012). Originally printed in 1950 as \"Every man has a right to his own opinion, but no man has a right to be wrong in his facts,\" this aphorism has also been attributed to James Schlesinger and Daniel Patrick Moynihan.

The severity of autism's deficits is extremely variable. Therefore, the term autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), or the autisms, is appropriate because it denotes a bell-shaped curve of impairment.53 It is no wonder an autistic child's regressive metamorphosis is so distressing to parents who may seek to blame others when no one is at fault, and may pursue remedies and miracle treatments when none exists. B. Former physician Andrew Wakefield and the autism hoax In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, then a British physician and medical researcher, wrote an article that was published in The Lancet, claiming the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) combination vaccine caused autism.54 During the press conference announcing the article's publication, Wakefield said, \"I cannot support the continued use of the three vaccines given together. . . . My concerns are that one more case of this is too many and that we put children at no greater risk if we dissociated those vaccines into three, but we may be averting the possibility of this problem.\"55 Public response was immediate. Many parents were understandably concerned about the impact of future immunizations on their children while others were fixing blame on the MMR vaccine for their children's already diagnosed autism.56 As with the smallpox vaccination protests of two centuries earlier, people wrote about their concerns and openly protested; but modernly, the Internet and social media allow unfettered and instant access to millions of readers. As protests mounted, fear of autism caused parents to eschew vaccinations and, as a result, herd immunity diminished.57 As a consequence of 53 Isabelle Rapin & Roberto F.

C. The Mercury Myth Wakefield's autism hoax has not been the only controversy fueled by fraudulent and misleading writings. A similar deception involving mercury and autism was on the horizon. Thimerosal is a vaccine additive containing ethylmercury, used in trace amounts in vaccines since the 1930s because it prevented bacterial contamination of the vaccine, especially in multi-dose vaccine vials.76 In 1999, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the United States Public Health Service published a joint statement77 announcing an agreement with vaccine manufacturers to remove thimerosal from vaccines as a precaution, although no adverse effects had been found. By 2001, thimerosal had been removed from all vaccines except multi-dose influenza vaccines vials.78 Also in 1999, Albert Enayati, who had been laid off by his employer, Pfizer (an international pharmaceutical manufacturer), sought to link autism to mercury in vaccines.79 He aligned himself 72 The Editors of The Lancet, Retraction\u2014Ileal-Lymphoid-Nodular Hyperplasia, Non-Specific Colitis, and Pervasive Developmental Disorder in Children, 375 THE LANCET 445, 445 (2010). 73 Wakefield's license to practice medicine was revoked and his medical credentials were no longer recognized in the U.K. 74 Fitness to Practice Panel Report, General Medical Council at *7, *9 (May 24, 2010), https://jdc325.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/andrew-wakefield-struck-off-gmc.pdf [http://perma.cc/7TC7-CEAK]. 75 Id., at *9. 76 Joint statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the United States Public Health Service (USPHS), 104 PEDIATRICS 568, 568-69 (1999) (A multi-dose vial contains a single vaccine in sufficient quantity to administer to many individuals and is often used in developing countries). 77 Id. at 568. 78 Sarah K.

Rather than address the known differences between ethylmercury and methylmercury\u2014differences that were one of the main points used by those who argued that thimerosal was safe\u2014the paper acted as if no such difference existed. . . .

The paper's authors tried to explain this omission by referring back to the unproven conjecture that had launched the project in the first place: \"parental reports of autistic children with elevated Hg.\"84 In The Panic Virus, Seth Mnookin characterized Enayati's unscientific methods and misrepresentation of facts as \"a tutorial in bad science\" and said, \"the paper's title may have been more accurate than its authors intended: Autism was a 'novel' form of mercury poisoning only in that it was entirely fictional.\"85 Enayati's claim that \"mercury\" was causing children's nervous systems to somehow develop autism took advantage of actual mercury poisonings in Minamata, Japan. The Minamata poisonings were the result of consuming contaminated fish and sea mammals contaminated with methylmercury, a neurotoxin.86 In contrast, ethylmercury\u2014the form contained in the vaccine additive thimerosal\u2014is chemically bound with sulfur, is metabolized and excreted rapidly, and is relatively non-toxic.\"87 A study of 109,863 children who received vaccines containing trace amounts of ethylmercury found no link to autism.88 Enayati's imaginary and misleading claims that mimicked real science added to the collection of anecdotes and hyperbole that stirred discontent in those opposed to vaccines.

During the subsequent fifteen years, more than 1100 peer-reviewed studies were published.89 A 2004 study examined all published research and selected (1) ten that were in English, (2) dealt directly with issues involving the MMR vaccine and ethylmercury exposure, and (3) whose study subjects were not already parties to litigation.90 This meta-analysis (a study of studies)91 included publications that studied 1,256,407 children92 of both case-control and cohort studies.93 The meta-analysis found \"no evidence of a relationship between vaccination and autism or autism spectrum disorders, and as such advocate[s] the continuation of immunisation programs according to national guidelines.\"94 Ironically, the incidence of autism continued to increase after thimerosal was removed from childhood vaccines.95 Yet the \"rising awareness of autism incidence, prevalence, and the postulated causation by childhood vaccinations has led to both an increased distrust in the trade-off between vaccine benefit out-weighing potential risks and an opportunity for disease resurgence\"96 as public opinion outweighs the clear scientific evidence. 89 Luke E.

Public Health Becomes Public Enemy: The Dunning-Kruger Effect A persistent belief in an impossible or disproven idea is difficult to comprehend. However, two psychology researchers developed a theory that explains the phenomenon. In 1999, Cornell University research psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger studied relatively skilled and unskilled individuals and the manner by which they evaluated complex information and their confidence in doing so.97 Dunning and Kruger consistently found that relatively unskilled individuals \"overestimated their logical reasoning ability\" and \"overestimated the number of test items they got right\" by a wide margin.98 Despite their low performance, the relatively unskilled individuals' illusory superiority persisted even when they were confronted with conflicting evidence, indicating an inability to appreciate their own \"incompetence.\"99 Paradoxically, their findings relating to highly skilled individuals showed that those who scored best on cognitive tests \"assumed the same was true for their [relatively unskilled] peers.\"100 This systematic bias caused highly skilled individuals to underestimate their abilities while projecting a high level of cognitive function and performance to the relatively unskilled individuals.101 These findings became known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, but the phenomenon had been mentioned in a different, yet illustrative, context more than forty years earlier: Suppose an individual believes something with his whole heart; suppose further that he has a commitment to this belief, that he has taken irrevocable actions because of it; finally, suppose that he is presented with evidence, unequivocal and undeniable evidence, that his belief is wrong: what will happen? The individual will frequently emerge, not only unshaken, but even more convinced of the truth of his beliefs than ever 97 See Justin Kruger & David Dunning, Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self-Assessments, 77 J.

Indeed, he may even show a new fervor about convincing and converting other people to his view.102 The Wakefield article and thimerosal claims caused justifiable public concern about the safety of the MMR vaccine as well as the vaccine program in general. \"Understandably, some parents are backing away from vaccines; one in ten are choosing not to give one or more vaccines. Some aren't giving any vaccines at all; since 1991, the percentage of unvaccinated children has more than doubled.\"103 Despite the failure of studies that included well over 1.2 million children, to establish a causal link between vaccinations and autism, vaccine confidence waned and the resulting decrease in vaccination rates has caused a resurgence of vaccine-preventable childhood illnesses due to \"unwarranted fear and speculation [that] threatens children around the world. . . .\"104 The Dunning-Kruger effect may explain why many people continue to hold fast to their beliefs even in the face of overwhelming evidence that the \"notion that vaccinations cause autism is pure myth\" and the scientific community's sentiment that \"failure to immunize based on unfounded fears constitutes an injustice to children.\"105 This account of a young mother's unwavering belief in the impossible and her search for someone or something to blame illustrates the power of the Dunning-Kruger effect: When thimerosal was long gone from vaccines, people kept discovering that their children were being made autistic by it. Searching minds grasped this attractive explanation and wouldn't let go. \"It was absolutely the vaccines. My husband and I have no doubt about that at all,\" Andrea Taube of Tucson told a reporter in 2005. Her son was normal, she said, until a few days before his first birthday, when he got four shots\u2014\"all with mercury\"\u2014and then began showing symptoms of autism. His first birthday was in 2003, by which point 102 LEON FESTINGER ET AL., WHEN PROPHESY FAILS 3 (2008). 103 PAUL A.

F. As One Belief Is Disproved, Another Is Created to Take Its Place A \"paradox of [vaccine] success is that, as parents have become less familiar with these diseases, they have become more questioning about the safety and necessity of immunisation.\"107 As an increasing number of scientific studies emerge validating the effectiveness of vaccines and disproving any autism causation, anti-vaccine activists have turned to other schemes to undermine vaccine programs.108 Some parents have come to believe that a child's immune system is not developed enough to \"cope\" with the number and variety of vaccines being recommended and may, in fact, be damaged as a result of receiving so many immune system challenges.109 Children's immune systems handle countless challenges in their normal environment and there is no evidence that their immune systems would be overloaded by multiple vaccinations.110 When one belief is irrefutably contradicted by valid scientific evidence, another explanation is developed to take the place of the one debunked, and with the same aim: to discredit vaccines. G. Enter the Angry Parent As the anti-vaccine movement gained momentum and vaccination rates fell, the protective effect of herd immunity has consequently diminished. Vaccine-preventable disease rates in unvaccinated children have climbed since the Wakefield and Enayati publications.111 For example, measles\u2014once all but eradicated in the United States\u2014 106 ARTHUR ALLEN, VACCINE\u2014THE CONTROVERSIAL STORY OF MEDICINE'S GREATEST LIFESAVER, 421 (2007). 107 Shona Hilton et al., 'Combined Vaccines Are Like a Sudden Onslaught to the Body's Immune System': Parental Concerns About Vaccine 'Overload' and 'Immune-Vulnerability,' 24 VACCINE 4321, 4321, 4325 (2006). 108 Id. 109 Id. 110 Id. at 4321. 111 Omer, supra note 46, at 1984-85. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 143 made a resurgence, most often in unvaccinated school-aged children.112 Many of the index cases were imported from other countries where measles remains prevalent.113 In susceptible Jewish communities, where mumps had been reduced by more than 90%, a 2006 outbreak was characterized by \"facilitated transmission [that] overcame vaccine-induced [herd] protection.\"114 A case-controlled study found \"a strong association between parental vaccine refusal and the risk of pertussis [whooping cough] infection in children\" and that \"[v]accine refusers had a twenty-three-fold increased risk.\"115 As a consequence of these and other vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, parents of children who cannot be vaccinated protested the reduction of the herd immunity that protects their children.116 Their anger is directed toward those who, based on false and misleading website information, choose not to vaccinate their children and collectively increase the risk of illness for those most susceptible.117 Those who cannot be vaccinated \"depend on those around them to be vaccinated; if not, they're the ones most likely to suffer during outbreaks.\"118 \"Caught in the middle are children. Left vulnerable, they're suffering the diseases of their grandparents. Recent outbreaks of measles, mumps, whooping cough, and bacterial meningitis have caused hundreds to suffer and some to die\u2014die because their parents feared vaccines more than the diseases they prevent.\"119 This is the paradox created by anti-vaccine sentiment. 112 CTRS.

Some vaccine opponents employ an increasingly wide variety of techniques to advance their agenda while advocating for alternatives they offer for sale.

However, physicians may not provide all the information parents need and may not fully understand the parents' conceptual model of how vaccines work, their individual and community benefits, the relative risks of vaccination, and the effects of the diseases they prevent.131 Therefore, 70% of parents will turn to the Internet instead of their physicians or a government agency as their primary source of information, principally for convenience (70%) and trustworthiness (17%).132 Using the most commonly employed search engines and most frequent vaccination search terms, a majority of searches produce predominantly anti-vaccine websites in the first ten search results.133 The ready availability of alternate views advanced by \"self-proclaimed experts\" suggests there is controversy where there is none and the advice of legitimate scientific experts becomes but another opinion among many of apparently equal weight.134 For example, Mothering.com, one of the most active resources for parents, \"receiving 1.5 million unique visitors per month,\" provides advice \"discouraging [patients from using] chemotherapy or radiation 128 Idiopathic refers to an illness for which its cause is currently unknown to medical science.

The Tactics Skewing the science.138138 This tactic is often used to discredit scientifically validated information so it appears to be the result of poor experimental methods, conflicts of interest, and other vaguely defined researcher biases.139 The science-skewers claim medical literature is incomplete and demands further research\u2014such as comparing the incidence of illness and long-term effects between groups of vaccinated and unvaccinated children.140 This \"needed\" research is chosen because it can never be ethically performed, leaving a seemingly critical issue forever unresolved and, therefore, in question.141 When a study is ethically designed by the anti-vaccine community and the results confirm the scientific evidence, the anti-vaccine community is quick to reject the study and criticize its own study design to discredit the findings.142 135 Id. at 3780.

As the Wakefield MMR-autism hoax was discredited, Enayati's thimerosal-autism connection took center stage and, when the thimerosal connection hoax was exposed, aluminum became the next \"cause\" of the various adverse effects of vaccines.144 In this Whac-a-Mole approach to sequentially disproved theories, anti-vaccine groups have progressed to claiming that other, unspecified \"toxins\" and \"poisons\" are the culprits.145 Additionally, new claims were born that too many vaccines were being administered, overloading young and supposedly immature immune systems, and that vaccines were given in too short a time frame, ignoring the evidence-based optimal vaccine schedule to develop an immune response and protection from the target illnesses.146 Censorship.147 While claiming to be objectively informational, anti-vaccination websites regularly deny access to commenters who are pro-vaccination and delete material added to their website by vaccine advocates in the guise of providing \"comment moderation.\"148 For example, the Mothering.com Vaccination Forum Guidelines state \"[w]e embrace all parents, regardless of their vaccination choice. Our Vaccinations forums discuss issues and concerns so that parents can make an informed decision. We are not, however, interested in hosting discussions advocating for mandatory vaccination.\"149 Attacking the opposition.150 Where scientific research and authentic debate fail, anti-vaccine activists attempt to win by intimidation.

The Tropes \"I'm not anti-vaccination, I'm pro-safe vaccines.\"153 To avoid the label of being anti-vaccine, many websites claim not to be against vaccination but, rather, for some greater good such as safe vaccines and a \"balanced scientific\" approach to vaccination.154 While providing misleading information, websites advocate that parents \"do research\"\u2014meaning they should gather information that is reasonably available to them on the Internet\u2014before deciding for themselves what, in their newly informed opinion, is right for their children.155 \"Vaccines are toxic.\"156 Many websites publish lists of supposed vaccine ingredients and pronounce their toxicity in broad terms, claiming the ingredients are known to cause poisoning.157 However, these sites claim toxicity that may exist at very high doses but ignore evidence that those same substances in minute quantities are harmless and, often, naturally occur in the human body.158 Claimed vaccine \"toxin\" effects from a single vaccine containing the substance as an inconsequentially small ingredient are compared to effects from chronic and daily long-term exposure to the ingredients at high concentrations.159 One claim that raises moral and safety concerns is that vaccines contain aborted fetal tissue.160 \"Vaccines should be 100% safe.\"161 Ignoring the reality that nothing can be perfectly safe under all conditions and that side effects can occur from any treatment, anti-vaccine advocates claim physicians do not trust vaccines since they will not pronounce them to be 100% safe and effective.162 This trope ignores both the impossibility of perfection while also ignoring the risk-benefit balance of vaccines that 152 Id. 153 Id. at 3783. 154 Id. 155 Id. 156 Id. 157 Id. 158 Id. 159 Id. 160 Wolfe, supra note 130, at 3247. 161 Kata, supra note 123, at 3783. 162 Id. 150 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 are \"one of the greatest achievements of biomedical science and public health.\"163 \"You can't prove vaccines are safe.\"164 This is the you-can't-prove-a-negative trope. Even though scientific researchers have proven in studies of over 1.2 million children165 that there is no evidence linking vaccines to autism, anti-vaccine advocates challenge scientists by claiming that, since the etiology of autism is unknown, the scientists have not proven that vaccines do not cause autism in every case.166 The impossibility of proving the negative is seen as actual evidence of causation\u2014or at least a refutation of the research that prove\" vaccines' safety.167 \"Vaccines don't save us.\"168 Anti-vaccine websites display graphs intended to show that infectious disease rates were declining before vaccinations were used and that the decreased incidence of vaccine-preventable diseases is due, instead, to improvements in sanitation and availability of clean water.169 This trope ignores the body of research that documents world-wide vaccine-preventable disease decline in areas where water and sanitation have been consistently good and have not declined in areas where vaccines are unavailable yet sanitation and potable water availability have improved.170 Also unexplained is why not all disease rates decline simultaneously but, instead, decline only after vaccines are developed and distributed. \"Vaccines are unnatural.\"171 Projecting the \"natural is better\" stance, anti-vaccine activists claim vaccines are not \"natural\" and, therefore, are somehow harmful.172 When presented as a natural alternative, parents have sought disease-induced immunity by 163 Wolfe, supra note 130, at 3245. 164 Kata, supra note 123, at 3783. 165 Taylor, supra note 90, at 3625. 166 Kata, supra note 123, at 3783. 167 Id. 168 Id. 169 See, e.g., David Mihalovic, Irrefutable Evidence Shows Historical Application of Vaccines Had No Health Benefit or Impact on Prevention of Infectious Disease, PREVENTDISEASE.COM, http://preventdisease.com/news/13/052413_Irrefutable-Evidence-Historical-Application-Vaccines-No-Health-Benefit-Impact-on-Prevention-Infectious-Disease.shtml [http://perma.cc/P2T2-XSJK] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015). 170 Kata, supra note 123, at 3783. 171 Id. 172 Id. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 151 intentionally trying to infect their children with vaccine preventable diseases at events dubbed \"chickenpox parties,\" ignoring the serious morbidity associated with acquiring the naturally-occurring disease.173 \"You must choose between diseases and vaccine injuries.\"174 By portraying the vaccination decision in terms of acquiring and suffering the consequences of a naturally occurring disease or suffering the side effects of vaccines, anti-vaccine activists present an exclusive choice without regard for intermediate possibilities, such as vaccination without side effects\u2014by far the most common outcome.175 Jenny McCarthy, a former Playboy model and television personality, is a self-professed anti-vaccine spokesperson who used this trope when she said, \"If you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f\u2014\u2014ing measles.\"176 This trope is especially effective when combined with the argument that vaccine-preventable diseases are so rare that vaccines are no longer needed, ignoring the benefit of herd immunity for those who cannot be vaccinated.177 \"Galileo was persecuted too.\"178 By comparing the work of anti-vaccine advocates to well-known historical figures who were considered heretics but were eventually proved correct, anti-vaccine advocates portray themselves as \"brave mavericks\" who challenge the scientific orthodoxy while awaiting vindication.179 \"Science was wrong before.\"180 Websites use examples of where science has been wrong to broadly paint all science as suspect and that alternate views provide another equally valid source of \"truth\" or explanation of natural and medical phenomena.181 173 Id. 174 Id. 175 Id. 176 Jeffrey Kluger, Jenny McCarthy on Autism and Vaccines, TIME, http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1888718,00.html [http://perma.cc/7XCS-XRWC] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015) (reporting Kluger's interview with McCarthy wherein she reiterated the already soundly disproved vaccine-autism link). 177 Gregory A.

Coincident vaccine administration and diagnosis of autism are unrelated.189 Anti-vaccination advocates continue to point to this apparent temporal juxtaposition as proof of causation rather than recognizing that expanded diagnostic criteria have changed the apparent incidence of autism through increased diagnosis.190 \"I am an expert in my own child.\"191 While denigrating and discounting vaccine researchers and other medical experts, anti-vaccine advocates generate emotional appeals for parents to \"do your 182 Id. at 3783-84. 183 Id. 184 Id. \"Doctors\" who have degrees in non-medical fields are usually only referred to as \"doctors\" and nature of their degrees go unmentioned; readers are not told that these \"doctors\" are not physicians and that they are not medically trained.

Parent testimonials are a common feature of anti-vaccine websites.194 One such testimonial to a national audience that reached millions of viewers was by actress/model-turned-vaccine/autism-spokesperson Jennifer McCarthy on the September 18, 2007, Oprah Winfrey Show where she said, in part: McCARTHY: First thing I did\u2014Google.

It also illustrates the anti-vaccine advocates' mantra that people without a science background can \"become educated\" through information obtained on the Internet, and that this education will allow parents to make informed decisions about complex medical issues because they know their children better than do the medical scientists and physicians. 192 Id. 193 Kata, supra note 133, at 1713. 194 Bean, supra note 145, at 1878. 195 Seth Mnookin, Jenny McCarthy's Mommy Instinct, THE PANIC VIRUS 252-56 (2011). 154 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 3. The Appeal of Alternative Medicine Two surveys of vaccine-related websites found 88%196 and 70%197 of sites specifically mentioned alternative medicine as a viable alternative to vaccines. One site stated, \"Homeopathy is noted for its success with vaccine damage recovery and to successfully prevent and treat the diseases of smallpox, measles, whooping cough, chickenpox, anthrax, etc.\"198 Homeopathic views\u2014that differ from conventionally held evidence of immunological principles and immunization practice\u2014strongly influence parents to avoid vaccination because they can be persuaded that vaccines harm the immune system.199 Another researcher noted that \"[a]nti-vaccination websites tended to reject scientific, clinical, and epidemiological studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Pro-vaccination studies were criticized as unreliable and conducted by those with vested interests in vaccination.\"200 B. Homeopathy: Water As an Alternative to Vaccines Homeopathy was created by Samuel Hahnemann in the late 18th century\u2014more than a hundred years before bacteria were found to cause disease\u2014as a way of keeping human body life forces in balance.201 Hahnemann contended that a normally toxic substance\u2014such as body fluid from a person already infected\u2014could be diluted to such an extreme extent that none of the original substance remained but the water molecules somehow retained a sufficiently strong and pharmacologically active memory of the substance that the person who consumed the water would be protected from that illness by its influence.202 Homeopaths offer no proof of this illusory memory nor a reason why the imagined memory is only of the homeopathic 196 Kata, supra note 133, at 1713; Bean, supra note 145, at 1877. 197 Wolfe, supra note 130, at 3247; Bean, supra note 145, at 1877. 198 Shirley Lipschutz-Robinson, Vaccination Warning, Immunization Side Effects, Injury or Death, SHIRLEY'S WELLNESS CAF\u00c9, http://www.shirleys-wellness-cafe.com/Vaccines/Vaccines [http://perma.cc/WMM5-FKDW] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015). 199 J.

One article proposed that mysterious and irreproducible nanoparticles somehow materialized and became the active ingredient following dilution.203 Hahnemann also devised scientific-sounding names for the dilution process. \"Potentization\" or \"dynamization\" is the process by which a solution is diluted to increase its potency, and \"succussion\" refers to the method by which a dilution is shaken to \"strengthen its affinity for the life force.\"204 The potency of a homeopathic remedy is said to paradoxically increase when successively diluted.205 Substances are placed into a solution using a process homeopaths call \"trituration,\" ostensibly to ensure all substances are dissolved.206 Serial 1:100 dilutions are performed until the desired dilution is achieved.207 Common dilution \"strengths\" are abbreviated as, for example, 30K, meaning the 1:100 dilution was performed 30 times.208 This would yield a dilution of 1:1060, where only 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000th of the active substance would remain. By comparison, there are 4.5 x 1046 molecules of water in all the oceans on earth, leaving a 30K homeopathic remedy still 1014 more dilute.209 In practical terms, beyond a dilution of 12K (a 1:1024 dilution), no active ingredient remains, leaving only water in homeopathic remedies.210 Bona fide researchers have called 203 Prashant S.

The effectiveness of homeopathic remedies cannot be explained in terms of the materialistic paradigm of modern medicine; we are far more than just our physical bodies.\"212 Another site refers to vaccines as \"chemical drugs in crude doses\" and states that \"the crude quantity of virus material [is] injected directly into a person's bloodstream.\"213 Conventional immunizations are not, of course, injected into the bloodstream; they are either injected subcutaneously\u2014just below the skin\u2014or intramuscularly\u2014deep into a bulky muscle.214 A homeopathic site with the impressive name of Hahnemann Center for Heilkunst215 & Homeopathy,216 says, The homeopathic immunization, on the contrary, provides an oral dose of an infinitesimal amount of the virus material alone, which does not shock the system.

They do work if your child is brewing up an infection. Remedies work by rebalancing your energy body when it is already destabilised by coming into contact with an illness. When you are in a particular pattern of illness, then the correct remedy will help you. But if your pattern does not match the curative pattern of a remedy (we call this a 'proving')\u2014then taking articular remedy will do nothing for you. The art of homeopathy is that of matching the remedy patterns to your own.219 The website author explains that a class of remedies is prepared from actual byproducts of disease (samples of sputum from patients infected with pertussis in this case); these alternatives to immunizations are termed \"nosodes\" and are created by using the dilution process described, supra.220 Another website author explains that nosodes \"are homeopathic remedies made from specific products of a particular disease [and] can be tissue containing actual disease 217 Id. 218 Id. 219 Cassandra Marks, Alternative to Immunization, http://www.whale.to/vaccines/marks.html [http://perma.cc/SVQ4-8Q8N] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015). 220 Id. 158 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 agents or tissue affected by those agents.

They are requested to include a new statement on nosode labels: \"This product is neither a vaccine nor an alternative to vaccination. This product has not been proven to prevent infection. Health Canada does not recommend its use in children and advises that your child receive all routine vaccinations.\" Nosode license holders have been asked to comply with the new labeling changes by January 2016.222 There is no similar warning in the United States. In 1992, Congress established the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) whose mission was \"to explore complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science.\"223 Several members of Congress hoped to validate their own beliefs in alternative therapies.224 In 1999, the OAM moved under the umbrella of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), within the Department of Health and Human Services, and was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).225 Even with intense pressure from Members of Congress who controlled NIH's budget and demanded proof alternative treatments were efficacious, NCCAM \"failed to prove that complementary or alternative therapies are anything more than placebos\" and, after spending $1.6 billion, 221 Robinson, supra note 5. 222 Rona Ambrose, Statement From the Minister of Health on Labeling Changes for Certain Homeopathic Products, GOV'T OF CANADA, (July 31, 2015), http://news.gc.ca/web/article-en.do?nid=1014019 [http://perma.cc/TV8A-WNQW]. 223 Paul A.

Our study does, however, have major implications for future research on homoeopathy. We believe that a serious effort to research homoeopathy is clearly warranted despite its implausibility.229 Subsequently, a larger \"systematic review of systematic reviews of homeopathy\" was conducted, aggregating data from many studies to \"critically evaluate all such papers . . . with a view to defining the clinical effectiveness of homeopathic medicines.\"230 The study concluded: [T]he hypothesis that any given homeopathic remedy leads to clinical effects that are relevantly different from placebo or superior to other control interventions for any medical condition, is not supported by evidence from systematic reviews.

Morbidity, Mortality, and Lifetime Effects of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases As with the first vaccine for smallpox, spurred by a feared and seemingly unrelenting menace, preventive and treatment measures have been designed to address humankind's most pressing health needs. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries have seen dramatic advances in disease prevention based on disease surveillance that has allowed scientists to focus on the most serious needs.237 \"Vaccines and their ability to prevent morbidity and mortality due to infectious diseases have been one of the greatest public health success stories.\"238 However, [a]s the widespread use of a vaccine diminishes or eliminates the risk of a disease, the public's perception of the vaccines' value paradoxically diminishes because the public no longer observes the disease or its aftermath, and hence perceives little or no benefit. The very success of the vaccine causes its benefit to be diluted or less valued once the disease is no longer considered a high-level threat or risk. Paradoxically, the more effective a vaccine is the more powerful the dilution of benefit effect appears to be.239 Yet, except for the world-wide eradication of smallpox and the near eradication of polio, these infectious diseases persist, and the threat of their morbidity, mortality, and lifetime effects remains.

Those who cannot be vaccinated include the very young,244 people with known sensitivities or allergies to a vaccine component, are pregnant (some vaccines), and those whose immune systems are compromised by immune system illnesses, such as certain malignancies, HIV, and other conditions that suppress the immune system's ability to respond appropriately to vaccine challenges.245 These vaccine-preventable diseases are very contagious and spread not only to individuals infected by the original case but also to several successive groups of people as the disease spreads through a community.246 Medical practice waiting rooms often contribute to the spread of diseases brought into the area by \"[y]oung children [who] 240 CTRS.

Family Economic Losses Economic losses incurred by caring for an ill child include lost income from work, non-reimbursed expenses from visits with healthcare providers, non-reimbursed expenses for hospitalization, and long-term care if the child develops permanent disabilities. The average cost to a family with a single child who contracts a vaccine-preventable illness requiring quarantine is approximately $775 per child if the child recovers uneventfully and does not require long-term care or treatment for a permanent resultant disability.248 3. Community Economic Costs \"[S]taging effective responses to measles outbreaks ha[s] a sizable economic impact on local and state public health departments [and t]he costs of measles outbreaks responses are compounded by the duration of outbreaks and the number of potentially susceptible contacts.\"249 These costs are borne by local and state health agencies that are unexpectedly required to provide disease assessment; surveille of all exposed or potentially exposed people, initiate and monitor quarantine of infected or potentially infected people, and perform DNA and other laboratory testing to determine the origin of the infection. In a 2005 outbreak caused by a single index case in Indiana, 500 people were potentially exposed to measles and thirty-four people contracted the illness; 94% percent of those infected were unvaccinated and there were two vaccination failures.250 \"[C]ontainment activities involved approximately 3650 person-hours, 247 Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee, Infection Control in Paediatric Office Settings, 13 PAEDIATRICS & CHILD HEALTH 408, 408 (2008). 248 Tara Haelle, Measles Outbreak in Dollars and Cents: It Costs Taxpayers Bigtime, FORBES (FEB. 11, 2015), http://www.forbes.com/sites/tarahaelle/2015/02/11/measles-outbreak-in-dollars-and-cents-it-costs-taxpayers-bigtime/ [http://perma.cc/6KFB-6HAW]. 249 Ismael R.

Even if reimbursed, insurers nevertheless indirectly bear the costs. State and federal benefit programs also reimburse hospitals for care to eligible beneficiaries. Schools must take special measures to ensure exposed or potentially exposed students, faculty, and other personnel are adequately protected. These costs are less well quantified but, nonetheless impact the organizations and institutions where people gather.

APPLYING THE LAWS OF MISREPRESENTATION The Law is for Protection of the People.255 But there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances society's interest in \"uninhibited, robust, and wide-open\" debate on public issues.256 This Part outlines the general theory of tortious misrepresentation and potential plaintiffs; discusses the relevant fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation tort actions and their specific scienter requirements under the Restatement (Second) of Torts; examines the common elements of privity, causation, and damages; and summarizes the pros and cons of available defenses. Two websites, Mercola.com and ImmunizationAlternatives.com, are used as illustrations of content that may represent fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, respectively. They were selected because of the richness of their content and the clarity of their representations. A. General Theory and Potential Plaintiffs A misrepresentation is a false assertion of fact.257 Standing alone, a misrepresentation can be harmless. However, when a person intentionally, recklessly, or negligently misrepresents a material fact to induce another person to act or refrain from an acting, tort liability may attach if the other person or a third person suffers harm as a result of reliance on the misrepresentation.258 A fact is material if \"the matter is such that it would be given weight in the plaintiff's decision-making process. This may be true either because a reasonable person would attach importance to the facts or because the defendant knows that the 255 KRIS KRISTOFFERSON, The Law is for Protection of the People, on ME AND BOBBY MCGEE (Monument Records 1970) (\"The law is for protection of the people, rules are rules and any fool can see . . . .\"). 256 Gertz v.

LAW INST. 1977). 166 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 matter is important to the plaintiff.\"259 Further, the \"misrepresentation normally must induce the plaintiff to enter into a transaction, or sometimes to avoid a transaction.\"260 This Article argues that tort liability attaches to publishers of commercial websites for foreseeable harm that results when websites dissuade parents from vaccinating their children in favor of purchasing products offered for sale on the websites. Restatement (Second) of Torts sections 310,261 and 525262 provide guidance when contending fraud through intentional or reckless misrepresentation. Sections 311263 and 552264 provide guidance when alleging negligent misrepresentation. The harm may result directly to the person who accepted and acted on the misrepresentation or to a third party whom \"the actor [the person making the misrepresentation] should expect to be put in peril by the action taken.\"265 Potential victim-plaintiffs include (1) voluntarily unvaccinated children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease, (2) persons who contract a vaccine-preventable disease from a voluntarily unvaccinated person, and (3) parents of children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease. Although others may be harmed consequent to a vaccine-preventable disease outbreak, these three categories represent the first tier of those harmed by the outbreak and most likely to successfully bring a tort action for misrepresentation. 1. Voluntarily unvaccinated children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease. This group includes children who are imperiled when their parents accept and act on a website's misrepresentation of facts about vaccinations and, as a direct result, do not vaccinate their children against vaccine-preventable illnesses. Actionable harm occurs when the child contracts the illness and thereby suffers morbidity. 259 VINCENT R. JOHNSON, ADVANCED TORT LAW: A PROBLEM APPROACH 14-15 (2d ed. 2010); Doe v.

LAW INST. 1965). 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 167 2. Persons who contract a vaccine-preventable disease from a voluntarily unvaccinated person. Since vaccines are not 100% effective in producing immunity, a small proportion of those who are vaccinated will remain susceptible to infection through no fault of their own and may contract the illness.266 These individuals could contract the infection directly from an infected person or as a secondary result of reduced herd immunity. Unvaccinated individuals increase the risk if infectious disease spread by reducing herd immunity when a sufficient number of people in a community are not immunized.267 Without effective herd immunity, other susceptible members of the community are more likely to become infected.268 Additionally, some individuals cannot be vaccinated because they are too young,269 have known sensitivities or allergies to a vaccine component, are pregnant (some vaccines), and have immune systems compromising illnesses.270 3. Parents of children who contract a vaccine-preventable disease. Parents of children who contract a vaccine-preventable illness suffer financial losses and emotional impact when their child becomes ill. These direct costs are discussed in Part IV.C.2 above. B. Fraudulent Misrepresentation The tort of fraudulent misrepresentation involves harm caused by intentional misrepresentation of fact or misrepresentation due to a reckless disregard for evidence in disagreement with information presented as factual.271 The resultant harm could be physical, in which case Restatement (Second) of Torts section 310272 would apply; or 266 Heininger, supra note 44, at 1266. 267 Fine, supra note 47, at 911. 268 Id. 269 Ctrs. for Disease Control and Prevention, supra note 45. 270 Examples of immune system compromising illnesses are certain malignancies, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and other conditions that suppress the immune system's ability to respond appropriately to vaccine challenges.

Although \"fraudulent misrepresentation has been traditionally considered a stand-alone economic or commercial tort,\" emotional, rather than physical or economic harm, also has been compensated in some jurisdictions.274 An action for fraud has five generally accepted elements that are required for a prima facie case: (1) a material misrepresentation of fact, (2) made with \"knowledge of the falsity or reckless disregard for the truth,\" that (3) caused intended or expected reliance, and (4) was \"justifiably relied upon,\" (5) by someone who was economically or physically harmed as a result of the reliance.275 Each element will be discussed separately below. Element 1: Material misrepresentation of fact: the falsity. As described in Parts IV.A.1. (Tactics) and IV.A.2. (Tropes) above, the websites at issue ignore valid, reproducible, peer-reviewed scientific evidence and, instead, publish information knowingly untrue or with a reckless disregard for the truth. For example, Joseph Mercola is an osteopathic physician whose website276 vaccine page277 offers educational articles and videos. A disclaimer at the bottom of each page informs readers that the website contents are Dr. Mercola's opinions. Webpages include the following: \"Vaccination Dangers Can Kill You or Ruin Your Life.\"278 273 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 525 (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 274 Doe v.

Therefore, the published information, singularly and in aggregate, constitutes material misrepresentations of facts. Element 2: The publisher had knowledge of the falsity or recklessly disregarded the truth. The Restatement (Second) of Torts explains: [A m]isrepresentation is fraudulent when the speaker (a) knows or believes that the matter is not as he represents it to be, (b) does not have the confidence in the accuracy of his representation that he states or 279 Joseph M.

On this page, Dr. Mercola claims aluminum in vaccines causes heavy metal toxicity, ignoring the orders of magnitude larger exposure through ingestion of ordinary foods compared to the trace amount in some vaccines. 280 Joseph M.

Eight years after the trace amounts of a non-toxic form of mercury were removed from vaccines, Dr. Mercola uses decades-old information to claim mercury remains in most vaccines and causes significant neurological and other damage. 281 Joseph M. Mercola, Groundbreaking Study: Vaccines Cause Children More Adverse Reactions Than Any Other Drug, MERCOLA.COM (Apr. 04, 2014), http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/04/26/vaccines-adverse-reaction.aspx?i_cid=cse-tbd-vaccines-content [http://perma.cc/TGU9-4CTT]. On this page, Dr. Mercola uses a Chinese study that is published only online and compares the raw rate of side effect from vaccines with rates of serious side effects from all other \"drugs\" as published in other unrelated studies. Dr. Mercola mixes numerator data from one study with denominator data from another study of different cohorts to make blanket claims that are inconsistent with the aggregate data. 170 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 implies, or (c) knows that he does not have the basis for his representation that he states or implies.282 The published \"facts\" on Dr. Mercola's website have been systematically refuted in the medical and scientific literature.283 Nevertheless, Mercola presents them as if they had not been researched or the purported connection of vaccines with the disorders he mentions has not been well enough studied. He asserts the reason is alleged government and pharmaceutical company conspiracies. The refutations of Dr. Mercola's published facts are found in the medical and scientific literature. However, Dr. Mercola has ignored the body of mainstream evidence and has published alternate and unsubstantiated conjecture as fact. Of these scientific and medical research studies, Dr. Mercola says: But clinical trials conducted by heavily biased \"researchers,\" advertisements, and news stories carefully scripted to scare you into belief, highly polished corporate offices and corporate websites, and an extreme focus on whatever has the most profit potential\u2014not lifesaving or life-enhancing potential\u2014are not qualifications. They are scams. Don't fall for them.284 Based on this statement, combined with informational material that vilifies modern medicine's approach to vaccinations, Dr. Mercola might not be able to escape the conclusion that the treatments he calls \"'non-conventional' may well necessitate a finding that [he] who practices such medicine deviates from 'accepted' medical standards.\"285 Misrepresentations of fact are actionable if they cause an intended or expected party to rely to her detriment. In Charell v. Gonzalez, after a woman with a uterine cancer had a hysterectomy and was told her treatment would require radiation and chemotherapy, she sought a \"second opinion\" from a naturopath who recommended against conventional treatment and, instead, convinced her to use a natural 282 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 526 (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 283 See supra Part III and accompanying text. 284 Joseph M. Mercola, About Dr. Mercola, http://www.mercola.com/forms/background.htm [http://perma.cc/95FB-FMBM] (last visited Nov. 20, 2015). 285 Charell v. Gonzalez, 660 N.Y.S.2d 665, 665-68 (Sup. Ct. 1997) (holding defendant naturopath was negligent in convincing a cancer patient to forego conventional therapy and, instead, purchase nutritional supplements from which the naturopath directly profited). 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 171 treatment instead.286 The treatment consisted of a special diet, coffee enemas, and supplements purchased from the naturopath.287 The plaintiff testified that the naturopath never told her that he was not an oncologist and that the treatment was not generally accepted in the medical community but, instead, told her the natural treatment was 75% successful in similar cancers.288 Plaintiff brought suit when her cancer returned, causing blindness and other permanent disabilities. The court held the naturopath was 51% at fault and plaintiff 49% at fault and awarded damages for past and future pain and suffering as well as punitive damages.289 Charell would be analogous to the facts in a suit for fraudulent misrepresentation against Dr. Mercola. Like Charell, where the alternative medicine provider said traditional treatment couldn't be trusted and that his treatment was superior to mainstream medical treatments, Dr. Mercola presents copious information disparaging well-accepted vaccinations and offering alternative treatments that contain no medically-active ingredient.290 In another case, In the Matter of Nature's Bounty, Inc., et al., the court held that advertisements about the contents and efficacy of health supplements were false and misleading because the \"respondents did not possess and rely upon a reasonable basis that substantiated such representations.\"291 Similarly, Dr. Mercola relies on a variety of tactics, tropes, and unsupported conjecture to present unsubstantiated information antithetical to scientifically supported medical practices. Therefore, Dr. Mercola's publications will most likely fulfill the element of being knowingly false or demonstrating a reckless disregard for and concealment of the truth. Element 3: The misinformation was intended or expected to cause reliance. Potential plaintiffs who are victims of fraudulent misrepresentation include all whom the publisher \"intends or has reason to expect to act or refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation.\"292 Third party liability attaches when the publisher 286 Id. at 666. 287 Id. 288 Id. 289 Id. at 667.

So when I say I GUARANTEE you that this is the answer, I mean it literally.\"302 Every page on the Mercola website contains advertisements for products sold in the online store, and frequent pop-up advertising messages are unavoidable.303 The intent of Dr. Mercola's website is unambiguous: it maligns vaccines and other modes of scientific medicine while extolling the virtues of his natural supplements.

Element 4: The misinformation was justifiably relied upon. Dr. Mercola's website contains a dedicated page on which Dr. Mercola describes his qualifications:305 You are wise to question who you can trust when it comes to maintaining, enhancing, or rebuilding your health. . . . And so, my qualifications: first and foremost, I am an osteopathic physician, also known as a DO. DOs are licensed physicians who, similar to MDs, can prescribe medication and perform surgery in all 50 states. DOs and MDs have similar training requiring four years of study in the basic and clinical sciences, and the successful completion of licensing exams. But DOs bring something extra to the practice of medicine. Osteopathic physicians practice a \"whole person\" approach, treating the entire person rather than just symptoms. Focusing on preventive health care, DOs help patients develop attitudes and lifestyles that don't just fight illness, but help prevent it, too. I am also board-certified in family medicine and served as the chairman of the family medicine department at St. Alexius Medical Center for five years. I am trained in both traditional and natural medicine. In addition, I was granted fellowship status by the American College of Nutrition (ACN) in October 2012.306 A reasonable person without a science or medical background would be justified in following the affirmative statements and advice on a website such as Dr. Mercola's, where the publisher presents valid 305 Mercola, About Dr. Mercola, supra note 285. 306 Id. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 175 credentials and information that, to the lay person, would reasonably appear to validate his claims. A plaintiff would have to show that she acted in reliance on the misrepresentations and that a reasonable person would have relied on the misinformation.307 Element 5: By someone who was harmed as a result of the reliance. As in all tort litigation, the plaintiff has the burden to prove harm and that actions taken in reliance on misrepresentations were the proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm without a superseding, intervening cause.308 An unvaccinated person who contracts a vaccine-preventable illness can show a medically sound direct link between the lack of immunity and contraction of the illness.309 The nexus of causation is more tenuous for secondary and tertiary cases.310 However, public health organizations use sophisticated epidemiological methods to accurately track the course of vaccine-preventable diseases and can establish scientifically valid links between patients and their contacts.311 Since this Article presents a novel approach312 to litigating potentially tortious Internet health-related website misrepresentation, other similar cases illustrate applicability by analogy. In Lentell v. Merrill Lynch & Co., non-client investors claimed Merrill Lynch manipulated market prices and published artificially inflated stock values on the Merrill Lynch investor website.313 Investors suffered substantial losses when the value of the inflated stock fell.314 Although Lentel's action was unsuccessful for other reasons,315 the court reiterated the generally accepted principles of fraudulent misrepresentation: 307 Johnson, supra note 260, at 15. 308 Id. 309 Parker, supra note 247, at 447, 449-53. 310 Id. 311 Id. 312 Austl.

(holding Homeopathy Plus! used false and misleading claims about the efficacy of the pertussis vaccine to entice customers to purchase nutritional substitutes in lieu of vaccination; imposed fines and injunctive relief). 313 396 F.3d 161, 165 (2d Cir. 2005). 314 Id. (\"[P]ublic investors lost hundreds of millions of dollars.\"). 315 Id. at 177 (holding plaintiffs did not properly claim per heightened pleading requirements). 176 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 To state a claim for relief . . . plaintiffs must allege that [a defendant] (1) made misstatements or omissions of material fact; (2) with scienter; (3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities; (4) upon which plaintiffs relied; and (5) that plaintiffs' reliance was the proximate cause of their injury.316 The court analyzed each element, connecting the misstatements knowingly placed in the Internet postings to stock purchases by investors who relied on the Internet postings and that such reliance was the proximate cause of the damages sought.317 Likewise, in cases such as Dr. Mercola's website, a plaintiff will likely be successful by proving the five elements of fraudulent misrepresentation\u2014(1) misrepresentation of fact, (2) intentional or reckless disregard for its falsity, (3) intended or expected reliance, (4) justifiably reliance, and (5) resultant harm. A plaintiff would be guided by Restatement (Second) of Torts section 310 to recover for physical harm, and Restatement (Second) of Torts section 525 for economic harm. C. Negligent Misrepresentation The tort of negligent misrepresentation involves harm caused by publication of false information for the guidance of others in a business transaction when the publisher \"fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\"318 Negligent misrepresentation does not command the same scienter requirement as fraudulent misrepresentation, needing only negligence rather than intent with regard to the veracity of published statements.319 Additionally, when misinformation is provided in the context of a commercial relationship with a pecuniary interest, the publisher is liable for harm caused by the consumer's \"justifiable reliance upon the information, if [the publisher] fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\"320 The resulting harm could be physical (in which 316 Id. at 172 (quoting In re IBM Securities Litigation, 163 F.3d 102, 106 (2d Cir. 1998)). 317 396 F.3d at 165-66. 318 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 552 (AM.

Similar to the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation, an action for negligent misrepresentation requires the following three elements to establish a prima facie case: (1) a publisher gives false information (2) to another who, reasonably relies on that information, and (3) is economically or physically harmed as a result of his or her reliance.323 The information can be conveyed to \"another\" and to a third person whom the publisher should expect to be put in peril by the misrepresentation.324 For recovery of economic losses in business transactions, the publisher must also fail to \"exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.\"325 Below, each element is explained and applied to a prototypical scenario involving websites that convey false and misleading information about vaccines to the public. Element 1: Publisher gives false information. Similar to fraudulent misrepresentation, website publishers use tactics and tropes, as discussed above, to publish information that ignores valid, reproducible, peer-reviewed scientific evidence and, instead publish information with a negligent disregard for the truth. For example, ImmunizationAlternatives.com is a website dedicated to informing readers of the many dangers of vaccination while advocating \"safe, effective\" homeopathic alternatives to vaccines as well as homeopathic treatments for already diagnosed vaccine-preventable illnesses.326 The website is published by Kari Kindem, a \"classical homeopath\" who has an undergraduate degree in international relations, has received 500 hours of homeopathic training, and received various certifications from homeopathic 321 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 311 (AM.

The links take readers to individual pages where the diseases are described and homeopathic remedies (that \"will help a person with the measles relieve their symptoms effectively and naturally\") are listed. Nowhere on these pages is advice to seek conventional medical consultation or treatment. Also not mentioned are the signs and symptoms of serious disease effects that would compel hospitalizations. See, e.g., Kari J.

A harmed plaintiff most likely would be able to prove the information published on the website constitutes material misrepresentations of facts. Element 2: To another who reasonably relies on that information. With bold red text, the ImmunizationAlternatives.com website contains affirmative statements that implore readers to avoid \"[t]oxic and [u]nsafe\" vaccines and, instead, use \"[h]omeoprophylaxis [as] a safe, homeopathic alternative that strengthens the immune system for natural immunity.\"331 As in the Mercola.com website, a reasonable person without a science or medical background would be justified in following the advice on a website such as ImmunizationAlternative.com, where the publisher presents homeopathic credentials and information that, to the lay person, would reasonably appear to validate her claims. In fact, there is no requirement that a publisher of misinformation have any medical expertise to cause actionable reliance on the part of a reader.332 A plaintiff would have to show that she acted in reliance on the misrepresentations and that a reasonable person would have relied on the misinformation.333 Element 3: And is economically or physically harmed as a result. As in the Mercola.com analysis, a plaintiff would have the burden to prove harm and that actions taken in reliance on misrepresentations were the proximate cause of the plaintiff's harm without a superseding, intervening cause.334 A plaintiff who has established appropriate privity through a transactional relationship with the website publisher and reasonably relied on the false information published on sites such as ImmunizationAlternative.com to her detriment would most likely be able to recover for economic or physical harm that resulted from that reliance. A plaintiff would be guided by Restatement (Second) of Torts section 311 to recover for physical harm, and Restatement (Second) of Torts section 552 for economic harm. 331 Kindem, VACCINATIONS: WHY SAY NO!, supra note 330. 332 Gianocostas v. Interface Grp.-Mass., Inc., 881 N.E.2d 134, 140 (Mass. 2008). 333 Johnson, supra note 260, at 15. 334 Id.; see supra Part IV.C.5 and accompanying text. 180 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 D. Privity Requirements In addition to the elements discussed above, fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation have different privity requirements. 1. Privity in Fraudulent Misrepresentation Restatement (Second) of Torts, section 531 states: One who makes a fraudulent misrepresentation is subject to liability to the persons or class of persons whom he intends or has reason to expect to act or to refrain from action in reliance upon the misrepresentation, for pecuniary loss suffered by them through their justifiable reliance in the type of transaction in which he intends or has reason to expect their conduct to be influenced.335 A website publisher would have \"reason to expect\" a reader would rely on the information presented if a reasonable person would believe a reader would follow the advice provided.336 In Ultramares Corp. v. Touche, defendants were held liable to a third party for defendant's financial statement certifications.337 The Ultramares court held that a wide circle of liability was justified by the reprehensible conduct of fraud, thus ensuring liability for harm to third party plaintiffs.338 As in Ultramares, websites such as Mercola.com are published and linked to search engines with the sole purpose of reaching a broad market audience and, thereby, enticing readers to purchase commercial products from them. However, a website publisher would not be liable for the beliefs or actions of unintended or unexpected third parties unless a direct connection or reasonable person's expectation can be proved.339 2. Privity in Negligent Misrepresentation While common law jurisdictions impose varying privity requirements between plaintiff and defendant, the Restatement (Second) or Torts takes a middle ground, requiring more than 335 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 531 (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 336 Id. cmt. d. 337 174 N.E. 441, 446 (N.Y. 1931). 338 Id. 339 Id. cmt. b. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 181 foreseeability but less than absolute or near privity.340 Restatement (Second) or Torts, section 552 states that negligent misrepresentation is actionable by a limited group of persons in whom the publisher induces or intends to induce reliance.341 Further, the website publisher need not know the identity of misinformation recipients but only that members of a group of persons\u2014in this case, those who visit the website\u2014have access to the information published on the website and will \"foreseeably . . . take some action in reliance upon\" the misinformation provided.342 Nevertheless, a person injured as the result of reliance on negligent misrepresentation may argue that the indicia of falsity are so compelling as to allow relaxation of privity requirements. E. Causation As in all tort actions, a plaintiff must prove both factual and proximate causation. 1. Factual causation\u2014the causal link. A \"plaintiff must show that 'but for' the defendant's tortious conduct, harm would not have occurred [and that], had the misrepresentation not been made, damages would not have been suffered.\"343 Both the Mercola.com and the ImmunizationAlternatives.com examples are \"not unwitting publication of an advertisement that turns out to be false [but], instead . . . the publisher took a knowing and active part in the perpetration of the fraud.\"344 In Knepper v. Brown, Dr. Brown, a dermatologist, portrayed himself to be a surgeon who was qualified to perform liposuction procedures.345 Knepper made her decision to undergo a liposuction procedure based on Brown's board certification, that he advertised and told Knepper was in \"plastic and reconstructive surgery,\" and based on the many advertisements by Brown that he could competently perform liposuction.346 The procedure was performed negligently, causing permanent harm.347 The 340 Johnson, supra note 260, at 140. 341 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 552(2) (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 342 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 552 cmt. h (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 343 Johnson, supra note 260, at 66. 344 Knepper v. Brown, 195 P.3d 383, 389 (Or. 2008). 345 Id. at 384. 346 Id. at 385. 347 Id. 182 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 court held \"the misrepresentation created the risk that those who relied on it would be harmed as a particular result\" of their reliance on the misrepresentation.348 Similarly, the Mercola.com and the ImmunizationAlternatives.com websites contain misrepresentations of fact material to readers' decisions about vaccination and use of vaccine alternatives. Readers may assert that, but for those affirmative statements, they would have made a different decision and not suffered the harm that resulted directly from actions taken in reliance on the websites' misinformation. On the other hand, unlike Knepper, where the physician falsely advertised and, on that basis, formed a doctor-patient relationship, people who find information on the Internet do not form a one-on-one relationship with a single website such that a direct causal link can be established easily. Websites offering anti-vaccine information are plentiful and readily accessible using one of many search engines. A plaintiff would have to show that she relied on the misinformation contained on the specific website and, but for that reliance, she would not have been harmed. For example, the Vaccination and Homeopathy website contains misinformation similar to that found on Mercola.com and ImmunizationAlternatives.com.349 If a plaintiff viewed other websites, she would have to show that the defendant's website was a factual cause, but not necessarily the only cause.350 Otherwise, a court may employ the alternative liability doctrine to shift the burden of proof to multiple named defendants to establish which caused the harm.351 The Restatement (Second) of Torts states: Where the conduct of two or more actors is tortious, and it is proved that harm has been caused to the plaintiff by only one of them, but there is uncertainty as 348 Id. at 389. 349 See Pratt, supra note 5. 350 Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506-07 (1957) (\"[T]he test of a jury case is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that [defendant's] negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages are sought. It does not matter that, from the evidence, the jury may also with reason, on grounds of probability, attribute the result to other causes, including the [defendant's] contributory negligence.\"). 351 Summers v. Tice, 199 P.2d 1, 4 (Cal. 1948). 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 183 to which one has caused it, the burden is upon each such actor to prove that he has not caused the harm.352 Without the alternative liability doctrine, \"there will rarely be any compensation for patients injured\" where the harm cannot be ascribed to a single defendant among many possible responsible defendants.353 However, a plaintiff could also provide indicia of reliance on a particular website by providing receipt evidence of her visit to the website on a specific date and purchase of goods from that website. If a website offers a membership or other way to sign up for newsletters or make purchases from an online store, such evidence of a plaintiff's greater interaction with the website than mere viewing would add strength to her claim. 2. Proximate (legal) causation. After a plaintiff establishes the defendant's conduct is a factual cause of her harm, she must also establish whether the defendant is legally responsible for the harm. \"A fraudulent misrepresentation is a legal cause of a pecuniary loss resulting from action or inaction in reliance upon it if, but only if, the loss might reasonably be expected to result from the reliance.\"354 Therefore, proximate cause is established if, from the perspective of a reasonable person looking forward, the harm was a foreseeable consequence of the defendant's actions, regardless of the extent of the harm or the manner in which it was induced.355 In cases of infection by vaccine-preventable diseases, the link between failure to vaccinate and harm from eventual illness can prove both the factual and proximate cause of harm.356 The 2005 Indiana measles outbreak illustrates how this causal link can be established definitively: \"This outbreak was caused by the importation of measles into a population of children whose parents had refused to have them vaccinated because of safety concerns about the vaccine. High 352 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 433B(3) (AM. LAW INST. 1965). 353 Ybarra v. Spangard, 154 P.2d 687, 691 (Cal. 1944) (holding multiple potential tortfeasors jointly liable for injuries to patient harmed while unconscious under anesthesia when the responsibility of the injury could not be attached to a single tortfeasor). 354 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 548A (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 355 Id. cmt. b. 356 Parker, supra note 247, at 452-54. 184 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 vaccination levels in the surrounding community and low rates of vaccine failure averted an epidemic.\"357 Vaccine-preventable diseases are endemic and exposure to someone infected with or carrying one of these diseases is a foreseeable and ordinary occurrence. Therefore exposure to, and subsequent infection with a vaccine-preventable disease would not be a superseding cause that would shift or eliminate liability.358 F. Damages Harm caused by either fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation may produce damages in the form of physical harm359 or economic losses.360 Liability also applies if harm befalls \"[t]hird parties whom the actor should expect to be put in peril by the action taken.\"361 Punitive damages may also be available in some jurisdictions depending on state or common law and constitutional limitations of proportionality and reasonableness.362 Plaintiffs' claims for damages would be evaluated on a case-by-case and injury-by-injury basis. Manifestations of harm will be unique to each case and so will the damages and their proof. Damages caused by failure to immunize are tangible and quantifiable. These include physical harm as well as pain and suffering caused to those who contract a vaccine-preventable disease, the economic impact of their care, lost wages caused by requirements to care for those who are sick, unreimbursed expenses of health care, and long-term expenditures for lasting disabilities. 357 Id. 358 Godbee v. Dimick, 213 S.W.3d 865, 883 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2006) (holding a negligent actor relieved from liability only when a \"new, independent, and unforseen [sic] cause intervenes to produce a result that could not have been foreseen\"); State v. Pelham, 824 A.2d 1082, 1092 (N.J. 2003) (holding independent intervening cause must be unforeseeable or an \"extraordinary and abnormal occurrence\") (quoting People v. Funes, 28 Cal.

LAW INST. 1965). 362 Johnson, supra note 260, at 99-102. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 185 G. Defenses 1. Plaintiff's assumption of the risk. While not an affirmative defense to fraud, a defendant in a negligent misrepresentation action may claim the plaintiff assumed the risk inherent in the activity by voluntarily participating.363 Assumption of the risk can create a barrier to liability.364 In cases of anti-vaccine website publishers who use the forum to sell alternative commercial products, the website publisher would likely claim that the website reader had decided not to vaccinate, or decided to use products available for sale on the website as a substitute for vaccination. The publisher may contend that, after reviewing the information presented, voluntarily choosing to believe the information to be true, and following the guidance on the website, the victim assented to the risks of using the products in lieu of vaccination. The website publisher would assert an assumption of the risk defense to hold the victim responsible for believing the false or misleading information that the publisher had placed on the commercial website. This defense would not likely garner judicial sympathy. Arguably, the least medically savvy and most gullible readers would fall prey to anti-vaccine websites. Notwithstanding this probability, the primary purpose of \"laws [is] to protect the weak, the uninformed, the unsuspecting, and the gullible from the exercise of their own volition.\"365 Further, \"[i]t is immaterial whether only the most gullible would have been deceived by this technique. [The law] protects the na\u00efve as well as the worldly-wise, and the former are more in need of protection than the latter\" who would otherwise remain silent victims.366 2. Contributory and comparative negligence. Likewise, a defendant in a negligent misrepresentation action may claim the plaintiff's negligence contributed to the harm caused by the action or inaction that resulted from the defendant's misrepresentations.367 In states where comparative negligence 363 Id. at 76. 364 Id. 365 Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 64 (1973). 366 Lemon v. United States, 278 F.2d 369, 373 (9th Cir. 1960) (holding a victim's gullibility did not preclude defendant's liability in a fraudulent misrepresentation action). 367 Johnson, supra note 260, at 65. 186 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 is used, a plaintiff's negligence is compared with that of the defendant.368 Depending on the state's formula for calculating comparative negligence, the successful plaintiff's award would be calculated based on her proportion of fault or, in some states, not awarded at all if too large a proportion of fault were assigned to the plaintiff.369 When anti-vaccine websites provide misinformation, and reliance on that misinformation produces harm, \"laws are to protect the weak, the uninformed, the unsuspecting, and the gullible from the exercise of their own volition.\"370 Uninformed victims who seek guidance on how to keep their family healthy would not likely be viewed as contributing to their own harm when relying on artfully presented misinformation.371 A defendant may also claim the plaintiff should have further investigated the veracity of claims made on the subject website. However, for the unsophisticated reader, \"there is no duty to investigate the truthfulness of a misrepresentation unless the facts and circumstances put the plaintiff on guard or cast suspicion upon its truthfulness.\"372 Thus, a plaintiff's reasonable reliance on artfully presented misrepresentations should not present a defendant with a viable defense. To do so would negate misrepresentation actions by using the success of the misrepresentation as a defense. 3. Truth. In actions for fraudulent misrepresentation, a defendant website publisher may contend that \"[t]he publisher of a statement injurious to another is not liable for injurious falsehood if the facts stated, or implied as justification for an opinion stated, are true.\"373 However, even an honestly held opinion is actionable if false.374 368 Id. At 65-66. 369 Id. 370 Paris Adult Theatre I, 413 U.S. at 64. 371 Darner Motor Sales, Inc. v. Universal Underwriters Ins. Co., 682 P.2d 388, 403 (Ariz. 1984) (holding an insurance broker liable for misleading statements on which he reasonably knew plaintiff would rely). 372 Doe v. Dilling, 888 N.E.2d 24, 47 (Ill. 2008) (Kilbride, J., concurring). 373 RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF TORTS \u00a7 634 (AM. LAW INST. 1977). 374 Id. cmt. c. 2016 Negative Portrayal of Vaccines by Commercial Websites 187 On popular websites such as ImmunizationAlternatives.com and Mercola.com, statement are made by professionals who present their credentials to lend credibility to their misrepresentations presented as fact. Indeed., \"most anti-vaccine speech is not merely opinion [but r]ather. Anti-vaccine advocacy\u2014whether made by medical providers or as part of a commercial transaction\u2014is almost always conveyed as [if it were] scientific or medical fact.\"375 In such cases, where a professional knows the \"misleading nature of a statement of opinion, or acts with reckless indifference, a layperson who detrimentally relies may be entitled to sue for damages.\"376 Website publishers' forceful statements provide evidence that the misrepresentations are not matters of opinion but \"facts\" the publisher hopes readers will accept.377 4. Free speech and advertising hyperbole. Website publishers may contend their website speech enjoys First Amendment protection. Indeed, the \"First Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation . . . based on the informational function of advertising.\"378 However, \"[f]or commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.\"379 Indeed, \"there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances society's interest in 'uninhibited, robust, and wide-open' debate on public 375 Amanda Z.

Comm'n, 447 U.S. 557, 563 (1980). 379 Id. at 566. 188 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 issues.\"380 In commercial anti-vaccine websites, misrepresentations of fact are presented in the context of a public controversy to influence readers to avoid vaccinations in favor of using products offered for sale on the websites. Misinformation that \"'links a product to a current public debate' is not thereby entitled to the constitutional protection afforded noncommercial speech . . . [T]here is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made in the context of commercial transactions.\"381 Additionally, commercial advertisers often use hyperbole (\"puffery\") to enhance the appeal of products without, however, saying anything specific about the facts.382 \"Statements that extend beyond expressing a favorable opinion, and instead assert false facts, are actionable.\"383 Therefore, website publishers who may claim their misinformation merely \"casts a rosy glow over a transaction\" are defeated by the specificity with which the misinformation is conveyed.384 To further discredit website publishers who misinform the public, First Amendment jurisprudence has demonstrated that \"punishing fraud has no impermissible 'chilling' effect on the right to express views\" on matters of public debate or controversy.385 5.

A defendant website publisher may claim that a disclaimer of liability located somewhere in the many pages that comprise the website sufficiently informs readers that information on the website is opinion, urges readers to make their own decisions, and purports to reject legal responsibility in the publisher.

Goldman Sachs Grp., Inc., a \"disclaimer of reliance cannot preclude a claim of justifiable reliance on the seller's misrepresentations or omissions unless (1) the disclaimer is made sufficiently specific to the particular type of fact misrepresented or undisclosed; and (2) the alleged misrepresentations or omissions did not concern facts peculiarly within the seller's knowledge.\"388 Courts will most likely find general disclaimers such as those on Mercola.com and ImmunizationAlternative.com websites are generic, boilerplate language that are ineffective in insulating publishers from liability. While the intent of the disclaimers is apparent, the disclaimers' advice that readers should make their own decisions is contradicted by the forceful and repetitive exhortations to avoid vaccines and to purchase alternative products on the website's online store. Additionally, a disclaimer caveat that products should be used under the guidance of someone trained in their use belies the contrary invitations to purchase products directly and consume them without any oversight by someone trained in their use. Therefore, general disclaimers, such as the one depicted above, will probably be inadequate to constitute effective warning and insulate the maker from liability. 387 Kari J.

CONCLUSION The crafty means contrived by the wit and greed of man to evade the law have too often been successful.389 There may be times when we are powerless to prevent injustice, but there must never be a time when we fail to protest.390 One of the greatest breakthroughs in science and medicine\u2014vaccines\u2014has been cast into doubt by those who are unaware of the horror of plagues long conquered by the achievement they now vilify. Smallpox is a memory. Polio exists only in four countries, thanks to vaccines and the tireless work of those who have dedicated their lives to its eradication. Thanks to near-universal vaccination in the United States, measles had been eradicated, save for cases imported from outside the United States. Mumps, rubella, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough, rotavirus, meningitis, chickenpox\u2014all have been contained by vaccines and a robust public health system. Yet conspiracy theories have combined with a few reality-deniers who have fraudulently popularized myths of autism, toxins, and contaminants to create such distrust in vaccines that the diseases they prevent are returning. Ubiquitous access to the Internet has facilitated the spread of false and misleading information for skeptics to find with the click of a mouse. Some websites combine misinformation with a profit motive, linking vaccine fear-mongering to offers of purportedly safe and effective alternatives such as natural supplements or homeopathic remedies, that contain no ingredients of medical value. While there are many products offered for sale on the Internet and elsewhere for which there is limited or no value, tortious liability attaches when that commercial product and the healthcare decisions that attend to its use cause harm to those who follow the false and misleading advice and to others who are secondarily affected. This Article has examined vaccine controversies, discussed many stratagems used on commercial anti-vaccine websites, and examined 389 In re Pittock, 19 F. Cas. 745, 747 (D. Or. 1873). 390 ELIE WIESEL, Hope, Despair and Memory, in NOBEL LECTURES, PEACE 1981-1990 (Tore Fr\u00e4ngsmyr ed., World Scientific Publishing Co. 1997).

He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his writings about his internment in several concentration camps, including Auschwitz and Buchenwald, during World War II. Id. 192 UMass Law Review v. 11 | 122 the distorted thinking involved in homeopathic practices and formulations. Although not yet litigated in this manner, this Article asserts that the Restatement (Second) or Torts offers viable litigation options in fraud and negligent misrepresentation for those harmed by false and misleading information on commercial websites that advocate their products in favor of proven vaccines. The nearly universal use of vaccines in the United States has immeasurably benefitted all persons and saved millions of lives. On the other hand, the commercial misrepresentation of vaccines benefits only the few who use fear, gullibility, and deceptive practices to profit while causing irreparable harm to some of those who believe and trust in the misrepresentations. For those harmed by such misrepresentation, the law provides remedies. "}
