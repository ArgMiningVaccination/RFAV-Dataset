Health is influenced by our thoughts our feelings and our life experiences. It is the balance of our physical, emotional and mental well-being and not just an absence of illness. Each day we have an opportunity to make positive choices, which greatly will influence our health and well-being. \"The doctor of the future will give no medicine but will interest his patient in the care of the human frame, in diet and in the cause and prevention of disease.\" - Thomas Edison Regular acupuncture treatments can assist you in maintaining your health and possibly preventing the onset of disease by recognizing subtle tendencies within the organ system that might cause future imbalances.
