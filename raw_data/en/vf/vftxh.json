[Essential oils](/nutrition/what-are-essential-oils) are aromatic substances that can be extracted from plants using distillation. It's possible to obtain essential oils from many different parts of a plant, including, but not limited to the leaves, flowers, and roots. In addition to being used as scents for a variety of consumer and natural products, some essential oils may be used for various health applications. When essential oils are used to promote well-being, it's referred to as [aromatherapy](/health/what-is-aromatherapy). Some of the possible uses of essential oils in aromatherapy include things like managing pain, helping with digestion, and reducing stress and anxiety. While scientific evidence for many of these uses is lacking, research is ongoing to learn more about the benefits of essential oils. The article below will examine 18 essential oils that may help with symptoms of anxiety. We'll discuss: - their potential benefits for anxiety and other conditions - how they can be applied - the things to keep in mind before using them One theory of how aromatherapy works is that essential oils can stimulate the smell receptors in your nose, which then sends messages to your nervous system. Some also believe that essential oils can have a subtle effect on the body's chemical and energy systems. Because of this, aromatherapy is often used as a natural remedy to help relieve anxiety and stress. Topical applications and inhalation are some common ways that essential oils can be used for aromatherapy. Essential oils should never be ingested, despite claims on the internet that suggest otherwise. There's not enough research on any one essential oil to prove it's safe to swallow. Each essential oil is very different, and some are toxic. It's important to know that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't regulate essential oils, so be diligent in your practice. You should only use therapeutic-grade oils that don't contain synthetic fragrance and only purchase from a trusted source. Once you have an essential oil picked out and on hand, you'll want to make sure you consider who is going to inhale it. Some essential oils are dangerous for children, others are not safe for pregnant and breastfeeding parents, and there are a number that are potentially toxic to pets. When applicable, consult a medical professional, like your pediatrician, OB-GYN, and veterinarian, before implementing use. We had a few considerations in mind as we pulled together our list of the best essential oils for anxiety. First, we looked for reputable companies that manufacture unadulterated, therapeutic-grade oils. While there isn't an industry standard for that term, some companies use it to differentiate between higher quality essential oils, and others that are made synthetically or that come blended with carrier oils, which are made from nuts or seeds. (Note that if you apply essential oils topically, you'll want a [carrier oil](/health/carrier-oil) to dilute it.) We also prioritized essential oils that come with certifications about their purity. Typically, that means gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) testing to confirm botanical origins and detect contaminants. Finally, we looked for companies that are transparent about their production methods and botanical sourcing. High quality essential oils that offer therapeutic value should be produced by steam-distilling or cold-pressed, and made with plant material only. Price Guide Prices vary depending on the amount of essential oil in a bottle. In our guide, we've listed the price per fluid ounce. - $: Under $25 - $$: $25-50 - $$$: Over $50 While research suggests there are health benefits, the FDA doesn't monitor or regulate the purity or quality of essential oils. It's important to talk with a healthcare professional before you begin using essential oils and be sure to research the [quality](https://greatist.com/health/best-essential-oils-how-to-buy-essential-oils) of a brand's products. Always do a [patch test](https://greatist.com/health/patch-test) before trying a new essential oil.

It's important to shop carefully for essential oils, as there may be potential risks with the use of these substances.
