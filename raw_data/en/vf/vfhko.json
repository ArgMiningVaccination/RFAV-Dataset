What is Homeopathy? Homeopathy, part of the natural health modalities, is a system of complementary medicine based on principles established over 200 years ago by German physician Samuel Hahnemann. By utilising the principle of 'Similars' or 'Like Cures Like' and using only the smallest doses of non-toxic substances, the therapy is both safe and effective. Homeopathic treatment is directed at the whole person. A well-selected homeopathic remedy can gently stimulate the natural healing forces of the body to bring about health. Using the Law of Similars, homeopaths match the symptoms of the patient to the symptoms produced by a substance when given to a healthy person. The testing of the substance on healthy persons is known as a 'proving'. The symptoms produced in provings form the content of our 'database', known in homeopathy as the Materia Medica. It is the knowledge held within the Materia Medica that enables the homeopath to find the precise remedy suited to the individual patient's needs, thereby bringing about an effective cure. Minimum dose homeopathic remedies are largely derived from animal, plant, and mineral sources. They are made using a method of serial dilution. The microdoses produced are called potentised remedies. The high dilutions produce extremely safe and effective medicines. Homeopathy's effectiveness in a wide range of conditions is increasingly being verified by high-quality clinical and laboratory trials (both human and animal), many of which have been published in respected journals in recent years e.g. The Lancet, British Medical Journal, Pediatrics.

Natural health is concerned with maintaining good health naturally through the quality of the food and drink we take in, the air we breathe, our daily physical activities, quality of sleep and interactions with other people; in other words, how we live our lives on a daily basis. Natural practices that help us to do this when we are in a state of reduced health are those that are non-invasive and support our intrinsic self-healing processes. These include homeopathy, naturopathic practices and herbalism, iridology, bioenergetic methods, massage, Reiki, acupuncture, yoga, biofeedback and hypnotherapy. "}
