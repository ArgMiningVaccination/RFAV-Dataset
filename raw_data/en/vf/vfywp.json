All of our treatment modalities are tailored to your individual health needs. naturopathic care what is Naturopathic Medicine? 'Naturopathic medicine is a distinct system of primary health care that concentrates on whole-patient wellness while emphasizing prevention and the process of self-healing through the use of natural therapies. Naturopathic medicine attempts to find the underlying cause of the patient's condition rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment. Naturopathic physicians are clinically trained primary care physicians who have graduated from a four-year naturopathic medical school. They work with patients in all aspects of family health to identify the underlying causes of disease and provide evidence-informed therapies to help facilitate the body's ability to restore and maintain optimal health.' - Association of Accredited Naturopathic Medical Colleges 6 Principles of Naturopathic Medicine NDs typically approach care by utilizing the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. NDs will refer when the patient's presentation is outside their scope or level of skill. NDs recognize the value of our natural world in assisting the healing process. Naturopathic doctors recognize and harness the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself in order to guide patients to wellness and total health. Naturopathic doctors elevate patient health literacy. Through education and a trust-based relationship, patients better understand the steps they need to take to achieve and maintain health. There is a time and place for symptom suppression; however, most naturopathic patients will benefit from identifying the underlying causes of illness and removing obstacles to cure. Naturopathic doctors understand the interconnectedness of our body, our environment and our lifestyle on total health. It is only through this whole-person-based approach that NDs seek to restore balance and health. Naturopathic medicine affirms that it is better to prevent illness and suffering whenever possible. Through their comprehensive practice, NDs combine all six principles in order to identify potential areas of imbalance and teach patients how to get well and stay well.

Chiropractic medicine focuses on the inter-relationship of the neuro-musculo-skeletal components that make up the body: the skeleton, the muscles, and the nerves that innervate the muscles and traverse through the skeletal structure. Chiropractic care optimizes the function of these structures through adjustments, postural analysis, exercises, and more, to promote health and well-being in the patient. A core tenant of chiropractic medicine is that the body holds the ability to heal itself when given proper support. The manipulation and stretching of your spinal joints through adjustments and decompression therapy work to free trapped nerves, reduce pain, restore your body's range of motion, and realign your spinal column. This in turn will allow your muscles to alleviate their tension and prevent injuries from reoccurring/decreasing their severity if they do. Chiropractors also adjust other joints in the body - such as hips and shoulders - to help re-establish optimal function. Chiropractors take the time to discuss and demonstrate exercises that support chiropractic adjustments to help maintain proper alignment. Through patient education, chiropractors focus on preventative medicine practices to support patients through all ages and provide possible solutions to daily physical difficulties at work or home.

While traditional sweat saunas simply raise the ambient temperature of the air, infrared heaters have been shown to warm the body in a similar mechanism to natural sunlight.
