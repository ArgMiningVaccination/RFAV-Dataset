The claims on your website establish that the products are drugs under section 201(g)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7321(g)(1)] because they are intended for use in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease and/or intended to affect the structure or any function of the body. As explained further below, introducing or delivering these products for introduction into interstate commerce for such uses violates the Act. You can find the Act and FDA regulations through links on FDA's home page at [www.fda.gov.](//www.fda.gov.) Examples of some of the website claims that provide evidence that your products are intended for use as drugs include: Phenibut FAA (all strengths)& Phenibut HCl (all strengths and varieties) On a page titled \"Phenibut\" in the \"Calm\" section of your website: \"Phenibut or -Phenyl--aminobutyric Acid is agonist and 2 subunit-containing voltage-dependent blocker activity, that has neuroprotective and anxiolytic properties.\" On the product HCl: \"Phenibut . . . to support relaxation, restful sleep, and positive mood.\" On the product pages for Phenibut FAA & Phenibut HCl, you provide graphics of the labels of the products that state: \"Boost Your Mood [] Reduce Your Stress\" Baicalein Product \"Baicalein also . . .\" \"Anti-inflammatory\" [located on webpage: \"It . . . as a treatment for diarrhea in diabetics.\" \"It is especially beneficial for use by diabetics and people with high cholesterol, who are at risk of developing diabetes.\" \"Powerful Anti-inflammatory\" [located on the Product webpage: \"Powerful Anti-inflammatory\" [located on the image is an extremely powerful anti-inflammatory . webpage: \"Fisetin is agent and inhibits activity pro-inflammatory cytokines \"Anti-Inflammatory\" image of the product label] The \"Lion's Mane\" page in the \"Cognition\" section website: \"Lion's Mane contains polysaccharides such as heteroglucans which protect the nervous system by improving neurite outgrowth in the brain - meaning they increase the growth of new axons and dendrites, components of brain cells, which may reduce inflammation in the brain and protect it from cell degeneration.\" Milk Thistle Product webpage: \"The Silymarin content within extract has been to . . . resistance . section of your Thistle has Extract Product webpage: \"The resin extracted from Boswellia serrata is an extremely powerful anti-inflammatory due to its ability to prevent the biosynthesis of leukotrienes, which has been found to be a major source of inflammation in the body.\" \"Powerful Anti-Inflammatory\" [located on the image of the The \"Boswellia Serrata Extract\" page . .\" The \"Research in animal studies suggests several important mechanisms of action relating to DHM's ability to protect against hangovers: . . . o It helps to reduce fatty acid accumulation in the liver o DHM reduced the expression of inflammation markers in the liver, including IL-1, NF- B, and TNF-.\" \"It is taken commonly to help reduce the symptoms of hangover and protect the liver against inflammation, especially caused by alcohol use.\" Product webpage: \"Plants with high levels of dihydromyricetin are commonly incorporated into traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and traditional japanese [sic] medicine (Kampo) for fevers, jaundice and other inflammatory illnesses.\" recently, Dihydromyricetin has received attention for its purported anti-hangover activity.

Most clinical trials support the role of garlic supplementation in lowering blood pressure.\" Unapproved New Drugs Your products are not generally recognized as safe and effective for the above-referenced uses and, therefore, these products are \"new drugs\" under section 201(p) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 321(p)]. With certain exceptions not applicable here, new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA, as described in sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 331(d), \u00a7 355(a)]. FDA approves a new drug based on scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective. Misbranded Drugs A drug is misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)] if the drug fails to bear adequate directions for its intended use(s). \"Adequate directions for use\" mean directions under which a layperson can use a drug safely and for the purposes for which it is intended (21 CFR 201.5). Prescription drugs, as defined in section 503(b)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 353(b)(1)(A)], can only be used safely at the direction, and under the supervision, of a licensed practitioner. Your products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract are intended for treatment of one or more diseases that are not amenable to self- diagnosis or treatment without the supervision of a licensed practitioner. Therefore, it is impossible to write adequate directions for a layperson to use your products safely for their intended purposes. Accordingly, your products Berberine HCL, Magnolia Bark Extract, Tongkat Ali Extract, Tribulus Terrestis Extract and Garlic Extract fail to bear adequate directions for their intended use and, therefore, the products are misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act [21 U.S.C. 352(f)(1)]. The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of these misbranded drugs violates section 301(a) of the Act Milk Thistle Extract products are misbranded within the meaning of section 403(q)(1)(A) of the Act [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343(q)(1)(A)] because the serving size declared on the labeling is incomplete. Serving size must be expressed in common household measures as set forth in 21 CFR 101.9(b) followed by the equivalent metric quantity in parentheses. We note, your Baicalin, Curcumin, DHM, and Milk Thistle Extract products' labeling fails to declare a complete and accurate statement of the net quantity of contents. For example, the product label expresses the net weight in metric units but fails to express the weight in terms of avoirdupois pound and ounce as required by 21 CFR 101.7(b)(1). For packages labeled in terms of weight, the net quantity of contents shall be expressed in pounds, with any remainder in terms of ounces or common or decimal fractions of the pound, as required by 21 CFR 101.7(j)(1). Conclusion This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive statement of violations that may exist in connection with your products. You are responsible for investigating and determining the causes of any violations and for preventing their recurrence or the occurrence of other violations. It is your responsibility to ensure that your firm complies with all requirements of federal law, including FDA regulations.
