Here we'll take a closer look at nine such practices, with a view to exploring their therapeutic benefits in greater depth. What are \"Holistic\" Practices? Another critical point is that these holistic healing methods are used in hospitals, clinics, and rehab centers alongside conventional medical and pharmaceutical treatments.

On their website, the [National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/complementary-alternative-or-integrative-health-whats-in-a-name), a branch of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) states that if an approach that's non-mainstream is used in conjunction with conventional medicine, the approach is considered \"complementary.\" On the other hand, if an approach that's non-mainstream is used instead of or as a substitute for traditional treatment, the approach is viewed as \"alternative.\" So, what is holistic treatment? It's incorporating one or several types of holistic healing into an integrative treatment plan or regimen for whole-person health.
