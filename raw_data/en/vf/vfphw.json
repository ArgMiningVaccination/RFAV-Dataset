Body is the gross manifestation while the mind is the subtle manifestation. They have a reciprocal relationship and any imbalance in one impacts the other and the whole system. Mind has a profound effect on the health of the body and we know many ailments can be Psychosomatic in nature. This simply means stress and tension that has been chronic is the basis for the energies and the breath to be negatively impacted creating imbalances in varies parts or organs of the body. For this reason, there are mindfulness and meditation along breathing techniques and practices that are used and necessary to bring calm and restfulness to the mind which in turn changes the physiological and biochemical status towards health and wellness.

This practice is rooted in the yogic tradition of ancient India and is based on the principle of opposing energies. There are many schools and varieties of hatha yoga, and all of them include asanas or poses as well as breathing techniques and meditation. Some asanas act as gentle stretching exercises and increase flexibility, others develop strength and balance. However, the practice of hatha yoga goes beyond physical exercises, because it helps achieve a balance between the body and mind cultivating higher forms of awareness through asanas or postures, breathing and meditation and relaxation techniques. This practice has both preventive and therapeutic advantages. Ayurvedic Yoga therapy is about designing a specific practice for the individual needs as well as for each specific conditions and ailment.

I feel so much better and lighter after only one week of following the guidelines. I now realize the importance of how to be when eating and what to eat for my constitution which by itself has made eating a sacred process for me. I now wake up and feel so calm as opposed to anxious or jittery. Before this program, I was not looking forward to the day and now I am. I also feel like my access to my memory and vocabulary has improved after only 2 weeks. I am using words that I had not in years. Dr. Mahdavi delivers much more than expected or promised. \" \" My journey with Dr. Atousa and Ayurvedic medicine began almost exactly one year ago today. I came to the Doctor with weight issues, stomach issues, sleep problems, energy problems and overall lethargy. I weighed around 227lbs, I am 6 foot tall and I was working out constantly. Perhaps too much. But I could never lose a pound. Actually, I was looking and feeling worse as time went on. After a thorough evaluation with Dr. Atousa, a plan and schedule was laid out specifically for me. Customized entirely based on my current state or constitution, my ailments and all my dosha. I completely changed my diet per Dr. Atousa's recommendation starting with a detox program that she gave me. The results were almost instantaneous. Today I weigh around 190, have tons more energy, sleep great and have never felt more mentally and physically vibrant since I was in my early twenties and I am 35 now. And it keeps evolving. The detox and proper diet have now allowed my body to adjust much more readily to adverse conditions, such as when the foods and environment are not ideal but I am forced to partake in them. For example, if I had to eat something not ideal to me, it won't weigh me down for days like it did in the past. I feel both physically and mentally primed to deal with any scenario I am faced with and it makes my life so much more fulfilling. I do not know where I would be today without Dr. Atousa's guidance and Ayurvedic science. Thank you very much Dr. Atousa! \" \" Not long ago, I acquired a mysterious dermatitis that one Dermatologist diagnosed as Psoriasis. In a previous and preliminary discussion, after asking a few pertinent questions over the phone, Dr. Mahdavi suggested that my symptoms were consistent with a Fungus infection. Later, after skin and blood tests were performed by a reputable Dermatologist, Dr. Mahdavi's hypothesis was proven to be correct. As a qualified medical examiner, Dr. Mahdavi combines analytical and academic aptitude with holistic, intuitive and nutritional knowledge, not only to diagnose and treat the symptom and the cause, but to heal and strengthen the total body, promoting preventive medicine as well. \" \" Time spent with Dr. Atousa Mahdavi is time very well spent! Being that Ayurveda is a science of life, based on achieving complete mind-body balance, it is important to seek the guidance of a doctor well-versed in the field, who not only \"talks the talk,\" but also \"walks the walk.\" After just one consultation and one follow-up, I feel more in-tune with my body, more understanding of my human emotions, and more aligned with my intuition, thanks to the time she spent with me and the information she provided. At our follow-up, she thoughtfully walked me through a concise packet of documents she had prepared, complete with a personalized action-plan of lifestyle recommendations, recipes, and guidelines, all of which I continue to reference often. And after less than two months, I feel significant improvement in my digestive system, energy level, and overall peace of mind. Getting to know yourself on this deeper level is such fun and a well-worth it journey, especially with the genuine support and guidance of Dr. Atousa Mahdavi along the way. Highly recommend! \" \" Thank you for the yoga practice yesterday. This is the exact type of yoga practice I was desiring to cultivate and I wanted you to know how much I appreciate your kindness and care in creating such a lovely space to learn. I was pleasantly surprised as to how fluid my morning practice was. It already feels like my body is just innately in tune with the rhythm of the sequences which is really nice. And I also already feel slightly more flexible today as well. I felt inclined to reach out and thank you again for everything. \" \" Dear Dr. Atousa, Thank you for the Surya Kriya (Yoga). Since taking Surya Kriya a few months ago I have seen the migraine headaches I have lived with all of my life almost completely disappear. I used to experience several migraines per week, some of them lasting several hours to the point of being extremely debilitating. I had gone to see a doctor for it and all he could offer me were prescription painkillers. Now that I do my Surya Kriya practice daily, I get headaches very rarely and if I do, it will go away within a couple of hours on its own, no painkillers needed! What a huge difference! I'm extremely grateful to have learned this incredible practice from you! Thank you! \" \" Dear Dr. Atousa, Thanks again for being such a good Teacher and thanks again for the opportunity of learning this wonderful yoga from you. I learned more than I asked for. My body has been reaching such a high level of vibrant that it feels as if every cell in it is \"crackling\" through the day. I am impressed at how fast some strength and flexibility already built up having practiced it twice a day for just two weeks! I have been really delighted with how well I am feeling right now as a result of these practices. I had no idea I could feel this well in my body at this age. \" \" Surya kriya (Yoga) has helped me tremendously with my back problem. I had a severe back problem for years & couldn't sit straight without support for more than 15 minutes. Regular practice of Surya kriya has strengthened my back & I can sit straight without any support for a long period of time. Surya kriya has also helped me to maintain equanimity in my entire system. Hugs, Love \" \" This weekend I learned about ancient Ayurveda practices from Dr. Atousa Mahdavi. Let me be clear, overall, I am a joyful, peaceful person. Thus, I didn't go seeking peace or relaxation. (Although that is definitely an additional benefit that is there in her retreats). I am blessed to say I have that in my daily life. I went seeking a better understanding of the ins and outs of the physical body as it pertains to illness from Ayurveda perspective - it was the most informative/educational retreat I have ever done. New door has opened for me. Forever grateful. \" \" Thank you so much for your time again and again. Dr. Atousa, I may have told you before, that since speaking with you last summer and taking the classes you offer, life has just been a lovely ride now. I would never imagine of being here in a more joyful and easier place, before. Absolute wonders have just taken place, since the day I decided to call you for info on yoga programs. I really admire you. You really are \"The master\". I can't thank you enough, and I am always telling friends and family about you. \" \" It has never been more important to be taking care of ourselves so that we may better support those we love. We want to support others on this journey of life and Dr. Atousa's retreat has been a truly wonderful experience in support of that. She invested in us with her whole being and I will always be appreciative. If you have ever felt like something was out of balance, this retreat very likely will have answers you've been seeking. \" Find educational and informative articles on health and wellness and simple tools and steps to incorporate in your daily routines and life style habits.
