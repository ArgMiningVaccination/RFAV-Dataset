The literature was reviewed to examine the efficacy of representative psychosocial-mind-body interventions, including relaxation, (cognitive) behavioral therapies, meditation, imagery, biofeedback, and hypnosis for several common clinical conditions. Methods: An electronic search was undertaken of the MEDLINE, PsycLIT, and the Cochrane Library databases and a manual search of the reference sections of relevant articles for related clinical trials and reviews of the literature. Studies examining mind-body interventions for psychological disorders were excluded. Owing to space limitations, studies examining more body-based therapies, such as yoga and tai chi chuan, were also not included. Data were extracted from relevant systematic reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials. Results: Drawing principally from systematic reviews and meta-analyses, there is considerable evidence of efficacy for several mind-body therapies in the treatment of coronary artery disease (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), headaches, insomnia, incontinence, chronic low back pain, disease and treatment-related symptoms of cancer, and improving postsurgical outcomes. We found moderate evidence of efficacy for mind-body therapies in the areas of hypertension and arthritis. Additional research is required to clarify the relative efficacy of different mind-body therapies, factors (such as specific patient characteristics) that might predict more or less successful outcomes, and mechanisms of action. Research is also necessary to examine the cost offsets associated with mind-body therapies. Conclusions: There is now considerable evidence that an array of mind-body therapies can be used as effective adjuncts to conventional medical treatment for a number of common clinical conditions.", "sitename": "American Board of Family Medicine", "date": "2003-03-01", "cleaned_text": "Relaxation techniques, broadly defined, include those practices whose primary stated goal is elicitation of a psychophysiological state of relaxation or hypoarousal. In certain practices, the goal might be to reduce muscular tension (as in progressive muscle relaxation in which muscles are alternatively tensed and relaxed). In other cases, the primary goal is to achieve a hypometabolic state of reduced sympathetic arousal. The most prominent example of the latter is Benson's relaxation response18,19 16.3 Meditation Meditation has been defined as the \"intentional self-regulation of attention,\" a systematic mental focus on particular aspects of inner or outer experience.20-23 Unlike many approaches in behavioral medicine (eg, biofeedback, relaxation strategies), most meditation practices were developed within a religious or spiritual context and held as their ultimate goal some type of spiritual growth, personal transformation, or transcendental experience. It has been argued that as a health care intervention, meditation can be taught and used effectively regardless of a patient's cultural or religious background.24 The two most extensively researched forms are transcendental meditation,25 in which practitioners repeat a silent word or phrase (a mantra) with the goal of quieting (and ultimately transcending) the ordinary stream of internal mental dialogue, and mindfulness meditation,26 in which practitioners simply observe or attend to (without judgment) thoughts, emotions, sensations, perceptions, etc, as they arise moment by moment in the field of awareness 10.0 Guided imagery Guided imagery involves the generation (either by oneself or guided by a practitioner) of different mental images. Using the capacities of visualization and imagination, individuals evoke images, usually either sensory or affective. These images are typically visualized with the goal of evoking a psychophysiological state of relaxation or with some specific outcome in mind (eg, visualizing one's immune system attacking cancer cells, imagining oneself feeling healthy and well, exploring subconscious themes, etc) 4.5 Hypnosis Hypnosis has been defined as \"a natural state of aroused, attentive focal concentration coupled with a relative suspension of peripheral awareness.\"27 Primary components of the hypnotic trance experience include (1) absorption, or the intense involvement of a central object of concentration; (2) dissociation, in which experiences that would ordinarily be experienced consciously occur outside of normal conscious awareness, in part owing to the intense absorption; and, (3) suggestibility, in which persons are more likely to accept outside input (ie, instructions, guidance) without cognitive censor or criticism27 1.2 Biofeedback Developed in the 1960s, biofeedback involves the use of devices that amplify physiological processes (eg, blood pressure, muscle activity) that are ordinarily difficult to perceive without some type of amplification. Participants are typically guided through relaxation and imagery exercises and instructed to alter their physiological processes using as a guide the provided biofeedback (typically visual or auditory). Examples of prominent forms of this therapy are electromyographic biofeedback, in which patients with a condition, such as tension headaches, are provided with feedback regarding the degree of tension in the frontalis muscle, or temperature biofeedback, in which patients with migraine headache disorder are instructed to warm their hands using as their feedback cue sounds or tones indicating temperature changes in this region of the body 1.0 Cognitive behavioral therapy Among more traditional psychological interventions, one of the more prominent MBTs is cognitive-behavioral therapy. It emphasizes the role of cognitive processes in shaping affective experience and argues that problematic emotions, such as anger, depression, and anxiety, result from irrational or faulty thinking.28,29 Behavior therapy (as distinguished from cognitive behavior approaches) tends to emphasize the use of environmental reinforcements (eg, not rewarding certain behaviors) to change or elicit certain behavioral changes. N/A Psychoeducational approaches These approaches typically combine certain psychological strategies (eg, cognitive behavioral coping skills training, relaxation, meditation, and imagery for stress reduction) with patient education (ie, teaching patients about their disease, appropriate treatments, self-care behaviors, and communicating with health care providers). A prototype is the Arthritis Self-Management Program developed by Lorig and colleagues30 N/A N/A = not available. Note: In describing MBTs, researchers have used a number of broad, interrelated terms, including \"behavioral,\" \"psychosocial,\" \"psychoeducational,\" and so on. Such variations in terminology can reflect differing approaches and emphases. Often, however, the terms simply reflect the particular theoretical orientations of the investigators (eg, those working in the complementary and alternative medicine field might refer to meditation as a mind-body therapy, whereas researchers within behavioral medicine might refer to it as a behavioral intervention). For simplicity of presentation, we have tried to use the broader term mind-body therapies throughout the article to refer collectively to these different approaches. Effect sizes: Pain = 0.62 Functional status = 0.35 7 * Effect sizes are typically derived from Cohen's d statistic,34 which represents the difference of the group means divided by their pooled standard deviation. Effect sizes therefore represent the difference between groups expressed in standard deviation units (ie, an effect size of 1.00 signifies a difference of one standard deviation in the outcome measure between the treatment and control groups). As suggested by Cohen, effect sizes between 0.20 and 0.50 are considered small, those between 0.50 and 0.80 moderate, and those greater than 0.80 large. Effect sizes in the behavioral sciences tend to be in the small to moderate range. In addition, even small effect sizes can represent important clinical phenomena, particularly when they represent changes in an outcome, such as mortality, or could potentially effect large numbers in the population. ES = effect size, OR = odds ratio, RA = rheumatoid arthritis. In addition to the current emphasis on exercise and nutrition, MBTs (that focus on the development of self-regulation skills, such as relaxation and the management of anger, hostility, and general stress reactivity) should be included as part of cardiac rehabilitation Cancer symptoms (disease and treatment related) Strong Positive results from 2 meta-analysis53,71 (6,166) MBTs (eg, relaxation, hypnosis, supportive group therapy) should be strongly considered as adjunctive therapy for cancer patients, given these therapies' showed efficacy in improving mood, quality of life, and coping with both the disease and treatment-related side effects Incontinence disorders Strong Positive results from 1 meta-analysis98; AHCPR guidelines (240) Biofeedback-assisted muscle retraining in the treatment of urinary incontinence. Can also be effective for fecal incontinence, although additional research is needed Surgical outcomes Strong Positive findings from 2 meta-analyses42,50 (6,904) MBTs (eg, relaxation, guided imagery, hypnosis, instructional interventions) can be recommended as part of presurgical preparation, although additional research is needed to determine the relative efficacy and cost-effectiveness of these different approaches Insomnia Strong Positive results from meta-analyses (4,009); NIH Consensus Panel MBTs (eg, muscle relaxation, cognitive-behavioral and behavioral therapies, such as stimulus control) should be considered in the treatment of insomnia. Additional research is required to determine how MBTs might be effectively combined with pharmacotherapy Headache Strong Positive results from 2 meta-analyses46,49 (3,083) The combination of relaxation and thermal biofeedback can be recommended as treatment for recurrent migraine, while the use of relaxation or muscle biofeedback can be recommended as adjunctive or stand-alone therapies for tension headaches Chronic low back pain Strong Positive findings from 1 high-quality meta-analysis62 (1,349) Multi-component MBTs that include some combination of stress management, coping skills training, or cognitive restructuring should be strongly considered as adjunctive therapies in medical management of chronic low back pain Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis Moderate-strong Positive findings from meta-analyses36,61 (though effect sizes generally small and frequently diminished with time) (4,337) Multimodal MBTs (that combine education with such approaches as relaxation, imagery, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral counseling) should be considered as potentially effective adjunctive treatments for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis Hypertension Moderate Positive results from 1 meta-analysis (1,651)51 but contradictory findings in 2 others44,108 MBTs (particularly multi-component as opposed to single-component interventions, such as stand-alone relaxation therapies) can be potentially useful adjuncts in the medical management of hypertension "}
