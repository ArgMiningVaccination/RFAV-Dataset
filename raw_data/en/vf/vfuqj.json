ESSENTIAL OIL BLENDs by [snow lotus](https://www.snowlotus.org/) Created by Peter Holmes for practitioners of Chinese medicine, the Five-Element Blends are basic treatment tools that allow the practitioner to shift patterns of imbalance among the Five Elements. Collectively, they provide modular tools for customised treatment on both a Qi and Shen level. They are especially effective for addressing the mental-emotional aspect of treatment. They work equally well on short-term conditions as well as on the individual constitution. These special Five Element Blends are very complementary to Constitutional Five-Element Acupuncture and can be used directly in conjunction with acupuncture points. They may also simply be given by direct inhalation on a tissue or cotton ball, or diffused with a diffuser in the treatment room during treatment. They are also safe for use in the same way by clients and patients to use at home or at work, where they will extend the benefits of treatment in the clinic. Owner, Peter Holmes, L.Ac., M.H. personally sources and selects the oils directly from small producers worldwide who ethically wild harvest or sustainably cultivate the plants and distill the oils in small batches. As a result of working directly with artisan - and not commercial - producers, quality is never compromised - the oils remain genuine, authentic and as unadulterated as when they were first distilled. Most [Snow Lotus oils](https://www.snowlotus.org/) are certified organic by trusted agencies (Ecocert, Ceres, Qualite-France, etc.) in their country of origin, as well as certified NOP organic by the USDA. The result is essential oils that are guaranteed fully potent and bioavailable when used for treatment purposes. For external use only. Properly dilute all essential oils in lotion or vegetable carrier oil before massage or other topical use. Keep out of reach of children. If you are pregnant, nursing, have any health conditions, or are taking medications, please consult your healthcare provider prior to using essential oils.
