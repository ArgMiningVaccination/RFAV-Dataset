Join our acupuncture healing community. 5 point acupuncture (the NADA protocol) uses sterile needles or beads to target points in the ear that calm the nervous system, support the lungs, kidney and liver to detoxify, and support overall healing in the body. Being in community with others enhances the healing effect. This simple technique becomes increasingly effective and lasts longer with each session. Leave feeling calm, relaxed and refreshed, with a renewed ability to cope with life stressors. Hands on energy healing is offered during the hour long session. Mondays 5-6pm Or by appointment for private groups Spiritual and Physical Health Counseling: Blending knowledge, experience and ongoing training, Rachel offers one-hour sessions to address your concerns and goals, using counseling and exploration of the deeper meaning of what your body is expressing to you. Healing happens on the physical, emotional and/or spiritual level, and often our body speaks to us in physical symptoms that need deeper understanding. Rachel uses her extensive experience and recent training in Spiritual Counseling and Hypnotherapy to explore concerns on a deeper level. CranioSacral Therapy: CST is a light-touch therapy that has deep therapeutic effects as tensions and energetic blocks are released, allowing the entire body to relax and self-correct. By freeing the central nervous system to perform at its best, CST naturally eliminates pain, stress and anxiety, and it supports the body's return to healing and balance. You will leave feeling relaxed and energized. Healing continues at the deepest level long after your session is complete. CST is used extensively for injury, illness, stress and anxiety. Energy Medicine Healing: An hour session includes a brief discussion of what you wish to focus on, followed by energy healing to address these concerns. You will lie fully clothed on a comfortable massage table. Rachel uses light touch to dissolve and release energy blocks that are creating discomfort and/or dis-ease in the body. She is trained in multiple energy modalities (W.I.S.E.; Trance Healing; Reiki Master) and is intuitively guided to where and how healing is most needed. Energy healing is often incorporated into other sessions. Medical Intuitive Session: An hour session includes a whole body scan and intuitive reading, coupled with a short energy healing or cranial sacral therapy session to address the most urgent need. This lays the foundation for future healing and/or counseling sessions. Rachel blends her extensive training and experience in the healthcare field with her Intuitive Healing skills to create sessions that address the healing you seek at the deepest, most complete level. Come explore what that means for you. 75 minute "}
