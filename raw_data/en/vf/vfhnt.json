Simply defined, chiropractic is \"practice done by hand.\" This practice was discovered in 1895 by DD Palmer. Ever hear of the \"power of human touch\"? Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine. Such disorders affect our general health and well being via the nervous system. Chiropractiors look at the whole person, i.e.. how is your posture, how are you moving, are you in pain. Then we look more closely at the joints of the body, especially the spine. Vertebral subluxations, or misalignments of vertebrae which reduce nerve function, occur due to postural changes (tech neck, slouching, stomach sleeping), trauma, sports and overuse, and even during our birth process. People often think of chiropractors as \"back/neck pain doctors\" but the reality is we effect the way the entire body functions by restoring proper communication from the brain to the body. In my practice, people report things such as their constipation clears up, breathing improves, ear infections heal, allergy symptoms decrease. Chiropractic adjustments remove nerve interference and allow the body to heal itself. See what our clients have to say about us! Get your Alignment Checked!
