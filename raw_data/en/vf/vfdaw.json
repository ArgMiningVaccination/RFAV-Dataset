Hello Reddit! My name is Terry Wahls, and I'm a professor of medicine at the University of Iowa and a practicing physician at the Iowa City Veteran's Affairs Hospital. In 2000, I was diagnosed with relapse remitting multiple sclerosis, and in 2003 I transitioned into progressive multiple sclerosis. I spent nearly four years in a wheelchair, getting worse and worse. In 2007, I crafted a series of dietary and lifestyle interventions based off my medical research and began a long, steady journey to recovery. Six months later, I was riding my bike for the first time in nearly a decade. In 2010, I began a study at the University of Iowa testing my interventions in others with progressive MS. You can read about my research [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24476345). The results have been incredibly positive, but a lot more research is underway. In 2011, I spoke at the TEDx conference in Iowa City, and [a video of that talk received more than 1.5 million views](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLjgBLwH3Wc) ( [not quite as many as my son's speech to the Iowa legislature,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSQQK2Vuf9Q) but still impressive!) and ignited a conversation about the use of food as medicine. Yesterday, a book documenting my recovery and the protocol I used to heal (but not cure) myself, was released. If you'd like, you can purchase a signed copy here: [http://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/](http://terrywahls.com/about-the-wahls-protocol/) It has been an incredible, beautiful journey and for me, it's only getting started. I'm looking forward to your questions!

I have to head at the moment, but thank you all so much, even those who had some pointed questions for me. I may be able to come back through and answer some more questions later. Thanks again. "}
