Given the ongoing vaccine rollout to healthcare personnel and residents of long -term care facilities, here we provide a preliminary assessment of real -world vaccination efficacy in 62,138 individuals from the Mayo Clinic and a ssociated health system (Arizona, Florida, Minnesota, Wisconsin) between December 1st 2020 and February 8th 2021. Our retrospective analysis contrasts 31,069 individuals receiving at least one dose of either vaccine with 31,069 unvaccinated individuals who are propensity -matched based on demographics, location (zip code), and number of prior SARS -CoV-2 PCR tests. 8,041 individuals received two doses of a COVID -19 vaccine and were at risk for infection at least 36 days after their first dose. Administration of two COVID -19 vaccine doses was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS -CoV-2 infection (95% CI: 68.4-97.1%) with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. Furthermore, vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID -19 had significantly lo wer 14 -day hospital admission rates than propensity -matched unvaccinated COVID -19 patients (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relative p -value: 0.007). Building upon the previous randomized trials of these vaccines, this study demonstrates their real -world effecti veness in reducing the rates of SARS -CoV-2 infection and COVID -19 severity among individuals at highest risk for infection. Introduction To date there have been over 107 million confirmed cases of COVID -19 and over 2.3 million associated deaths globally (1). From the moment that SARS -CoV-2 was identified as the causative agent of COVID -19, efforts were initiated to characterize this virus and to develop vaccines against it ( 2, 3, 4). Within months, several candidates were shown to be safe and to induce robust immune responses against SARS -CoV-2 in a series of early phase trials ( 5, 6, 7, 8). More recently, multiple vaccine candidates have shown over 94% efficacy in preventing .

Of note, unlike the seasonal flu vaccine, both of these candidates are delivered as a series of two inoculations separated by three or four weeks, with maximal response believed to be achieved by on e to two weeks after the second dose ( 5, 6, 9, 10). In a phase 3 trial studying BNT162b2 ( 9), the COVID -19 vaccine candidate developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, 50 out of 21,314 (0.23%) vaccinated patients experienced a symptomatic COVID -19 infection, with an incidence rate of 12.5 cases per 1000 person -years. In contrast, 275 of 21,258 (1.29%) patients receiving a placebo injection developed COVID -19, with an incidence rate of 69.1 cases per 1000 person -years. Thirty patients experienced seve re disease, all of whom had received placebo. Seven or more days after the second dose, the difference between groups was even more pronounced, with incidence rates of 3.61 and 72.9 cases per 1000 person -years in the vaccinated and placebo groups, respecti vely (efficacy = 95.0%; 95% trial studying -1273 ( 10), the vaccine candidate developed by Moderna, 19 of 14,550 (0.13%) vaccinated patients experienced a symptoma tic infection compared to 269 of 14,598 (1.84%) patients receiving placebo. Among these symptomatic infections, there were 9 cases of severe COVID -19 in the placebo group compared to only one in the vaccinated cohort. This effect was stronger when consider ing infection rates 14 or more days after the second dose, with incidence rates of 3.3 and 56.5 cases per 1000 person -years in the vaccinated and placebo groups, respectively (efficacy = 95% CI: now bein g administered throughout the United States under an Emergency Use Authorization by the FDA, with first priority given to individuals at high risk for becoming infected with SARS -CoV-2 or experiencing severe COVID -19, including healthcare workers and resid ents of long term care facilities ( 11). While these groups were not excluded from the phase 3 trials, vaccine efficacy has not been specifically demonstrated among them. It is thus critical to analyze outcomes of vaccinated patients to date to determine whether these vaccines are indeed effective in especially high -risk individuals. Here we conducted a large -scale real world interim analysis of COVID -19 vaccination outcomes in the United States. Specif ically, we assessed the rates of SARS -CoV-2 positivity and severity of COVID -19 among 31,069 individuals who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA -1273 in the Mayo Clinic health system, including sites in Minnesota, Arizona, Florida, and Wisconsin . One challenge inherent to such real world analyses is the lack of a built -in placebo arm, which is essential to establish the expected infection rate during the study period and thereby to assess vaccine efficacy. To address this shortcoming, we used 1 -to-1 propensity score matching to generate a cohort of 31,069 individuals who were not previously infected with SARS - CoV-2 and did not receive a COVID -19 vaccine by the end of the study period ( Figure 1 , Table 1). This control arm was balanced for potential confounding factors for COVID -19 infection, including: demographics, location (zip code), and number of PCR tests received prior to the study period. Using this control arm, we compared rates of SARS -CoV-2 infection during defined intervals after study e nrollment. In addition, in order to evaluate the potential impact of COVID -19 vaccination upon disease severity, we conducted a similar matched analysis on the 263 vaccinated individuals who subsequently tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 during the study pe riod following their first dose of .

In particular, we used 1 -to-10 propensity score matching to generate a cohort of 2,630 individuals who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 during the study period who never received any vaccination for COVID -19. Thi s control arm was balanced for potential confounding factors for severity of COVID -19 illness, including demographics and comorbidities identified from the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health records for these patients. Using this control arm, we compared rates of hospital admission, ICU admission, and mortality in the 14 days following the date of the SARS -CoV-2 infection. Methods Study design, setting and population This is a retrospective study of individuals who underwent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for suspected SARS -CoV-2 infection at the Mayo Clinic and hospitals affiliated to the Mayo health system. This study was reviewed and approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB 20 -003278) as a minimal risk study. Subjects were excluded if they did not have a research authorization on file. The IRB approved was titled: Study of COVID -19 patient characteristics with augmented curation of Electronic Health Records (EHR) to inform strategic and operational decisions with the Mayo Clinic. The following resource provides further information on the Mayo Clinic's institutional review board and adherenc e to basic ethical principles underlying the conduct of research, and ensuring that the rights and well -being of potential research subjects are adequately protected(https://www.mayo.edu/research/institutional -review -board/overview). In total, there were 507,525 patients in the Mayo electronic health record (EHR) database who received a PCR test between February 15, 2020 and February 8, 2021. To obtain the study population, we defined the following inclusion criteria: (1) at least 18 years old; (2) no positive SARS -CoV-2 PCR test before December 1, 2020; (3) resides in a locale (based on Zip code) with at least 25 patients who have received BNT162b2 or mRNA -1273. This population included 249,708 patients, of 31,623 have received BNT162b2 or mRNA -1273 and 218,085 have no record of COVID -19 vaccination. Vaccinated individuals who had tested positive for SARS - CoV-2 by PCR between December 1, 2020 and the da te of their first vaccine dose were excluded, resulting in 31,299 individuals. Individuals with zero follow -up days after vaccination (i.e. those who received the first vaccine dose on the date of data collection) were also excluded, leaving 31,069 patient s in the final vaccinated cohort. Propensity matched unvaccinated cohorts for analyses of vaccine efficacy were selected from the previously derived set of 218,085 unvaccinated patients. This patient selection algorithm and its associated counts are summar ized in Figure 1A . More details on the propensity score matching procedure for the vaccine efficacy analysis are provided in the next section. We conducted a similar matching analysis to assess the impact of vaccination upon COVID -19 disease severity. F or this analysis, we considered the 263 vaccinated patients who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 following their first vaccine dose during the study period, and 14,512 unvaccinated patients who tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 during the study period.

This patient selection algorithm and its associated counts are summarized in Figure 1B . More details on the propensity score matching procedures for the disease severity analysis are provided in a subsequent section. Propensity score matching to select the unvaccinated cohort for efficacy analysis We employed 1:1 propensity score matching ( 12) to construct an unvaccinated cohort similar to the vaccinated cohort on key risk factors for SARS -CoV-2 infection, including geography, demographics, and records of PCR testing. Specifically, first we matched exactly based on geography (zip code of the patient's residence). Next, we used propensity score matching to match approximately based upon demographic features (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and records of PCR testing (number of negative PCR tests taken between Feb ruary 8, 2020 and November 30, 2020); the number of negative PCR tests covariate serves as a proxy for ongoing baseline exposure to COVID. To obtain the propensity scores for the matching procedure, we trained regularized logistic regression models for eac h zip code using the software package sklearn v0.20.3 in Python. Using these propensity scores, we then matched each of the 31,299 vaccinated patients (who received at least one dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA -1273 and had not tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 bet ween December 1, 2020 and the date of their first vaccination) with 1 patient out of the 218,085 unvaccinated patients, using greedy nearest -neighbor matching without replacement (13). In particular, for each vaccinated patient, we selected an unvaccinated patient that lived in the same zip code with the closest propensity score to the vaccinated patient. The cohorts were then su bsetted to only include the 31,069 vaccinated individuals (and their corresponding propensity matched individuals) who had at least one day of follow -up after their date of study enrollment. For each vaccinated patient, the date of study enrollment (Day 0) was defined as the date of their first vaccine dose. For each unvaccinated patient, the date of study enrollment was defined as the date of the first vaccine dose for their matched vaccinated patient. The resulting cohorts are summarized in Table 1 along with the standardized mean differences (SMD) of their clinical covariates ( 14, 15). Overall, there is no substantial difference between the two c ohorts in any of the clinical covariates that were included in propensity score matching (with SMD < 0.1 for all covariates). The age distributions of patients in the vaccinated, unmatched unvaccinated, and propensity matched unvaccinated cohorts are shown in Figure S1A -B. Additional data regarding the mean follow -up time, the number of vaccine doses received, and the number of patients taking at least one SARS -CoV-2 PCR test after the study enrollment date are provided in Table S1 . The distribution of tota l follow -up time (i.e. days between first vaccine dose and the end of the data collection period) for the 31,299 vaccinated patients is provided in Figure S2A . Evaluation of vaccine efficacy To evaluate the COVID -19 vaccine efficacy in a real -world clinica l setting, we compared the two populations described above and summarized in Figure 1 : (1) 31,069 individuals with .

Cumulative proportional incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection was compared between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients by Kaplan Meier analysis. Cumulative proportional incidence at time t is the estimated proportion of patients who experience the outcome on or before time t, i.e. 1 minus the standard Kaplan -Meier survival estimate. We considered cumulative incidence starting at Day 1, Day 14, and Day 28 relative to the date of study enrollment (Day 0). Statistical significance was assessed with the log rank test ( 16). Efficacy was also assessed during defined intervals by computing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts. Efficacy was defined as 100% x (1 - IRR). The time periods considered were as follows: (1) Day 1 onwards, (2) Day 15 onwards, (3) Day 29 onwards, (4) Day 36 onwards, and (5) six one -week intervals starting one day after the first dose of vaccination (\"Day 1\"). Only six one -week intervals were considered because less than 25% of the patients in each cohort had adequate f ollow -up to contribute at -risk person days after this time. For each cohort in a given time period, incidence rates were calculated as the number of patients testing positive for SARS -CoV-2 in that time period divided by the total number of at -risk person -days contributed in that time period. For each patient, at -risk person -days are defined as the number of days in the time period in which the patient has not yet tested positive for SARS - CoV-2 or died. The IRR was calculated as the incidence rate of the va ccinated cohort divided by the incidence rate of the unvaccinated cohort, and its 95% confidence interval was computed using an exact approach described previously ( 17). Propensity score matching to se lect the unvaccinated COVID -19 patients for disease severity analysis Similarly, we applied 1:10 propensity score matching ( 12) to construct a SARS -CoV-2 positive unvaccinated cohort similar in baselin e clinical covariates to the cohort of patients who were vaccinated and subsequently tested positive for SARS -CoV-2. In particular, we used propensity score matching to match approximately based upon demographic features (age, sex, race, ethnicity) and com orbidities (asthma, cancer, cardiomyopathy, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, heart failure, hypertension, obesity, pregnancy, severe obesity, sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant, stroke / cereb rovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus). This list of comorbidities was derived from the list of risk factors for severe COVID -19 illness provided by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention ( 18). We used deep neural networks to automatically identify comorbidities from the clinical notes, which are described in the next section. To obtain the propensity scores, we trained a regularized logistic regression model with these features using the software package sklearn v0.20.3 in Python. Based on these propensity scores, we matched each of the 263 individuals that tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 after vaccination with 10 individuals out of the 14,512 individuals that tested positive for SARS -CoV-2 and that were not vaccinated. As in the previous propensity score matching procedure, we used greedy nearest -neighbor matching without replacement (13). The .

Overall, there is no significant difference between the two cohorts in any of the clinical covariates that were included in propensity score matching (with SMD < 0.1 for all covariates). The age distributions of COVID -19 patients in the vaccinated cohor t, unmatched unvaccinated cohort, and propensity matched unvaccinated cohort are shown in Figure S1C -D. The distribution of total follow -up time (i.e. days between diagnosis date and the end of the data collection period) is provided in Figure S2B . For eac h SARS -CoV-2 positive patient in both the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts, the index date for the analysis (day 0) was taken to be the date of the first positive PCR test. Clinical outcomes at 14 days were compared, including hospital admission, ICU a dmission, and mortality. Evaluation of disease severity We compare the clinical outcomes of vaccinated and propensity -matched unvaccinated SARS -CoV-2 positive patients in order to evaluate the impact of COVID -19 vaccination upon disease severity. Among the patients in each cohort with at least 14 days of follow -up after their first positive PCR test (n = 191 vaccinated, 2,348 unvaccinated), we evaluate: (1) 14 -day hospital admission rate: Number of patients admitted to the hospital in the two weeks foll owing their positive PCR test, (2) 14 -day ICU admission rate: Number of patients admitted to the ICU in the two weeks following their positive PCR test, and (3) 14 -day mortality rate: Number of patients deceased in the two weeks following their positive PC R test. For each outcome, we report the relative risk (rate in the vaccinated cohort divided by the rate in the matched unvaccinated cohort), 95% confidence interval for the relative risk ( 19), and Fis her's exact test p -value. Hospital -free and ICU -free survival were also compared via Kaplan -Meier analysis, with statistical significance assessed with the log rank test ( 16). Deep neural networks to i dentify comorbidities from clinical notes In order to identify the comorbidities from the electronic health record for each patient, we used a BERT -based neural network model ( 20) to classify the sent iment for the phenotypes that appeared in the clinical notes. In particular, we applied a phenotype sentiment classification model that had been trained on 18,500 sentences which achieves an out -of-sample accuracy of 93.6% with precision and recall scores above 95% ( 21). This classification model predicts four classes, including: (1) \"Yes\": confirmed diagnosis (2) \"No\": ruled -out diagnosis, (3) \"Maybe\": possibility of disease, and (4) \"Other\": alternate context (e.g. family history of disease). For each patient, we applied the sentiment model to the clinical notes in the Mayo Clinic electronic health record from December 1, 2015 to November 30, 2020. For each comorbidity phenotype, if a patient had at least one mention of the phenotype during the time period with a confidence score of 90% or greater, then the patient was labelled as having the phenotype. .

The incidence rates of positive SARS -CoV-2 tests in the vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts were 0.31 and 0.8 cases per 1000 person -days, respectively. This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 60.7% (95% CI: 54.6 -66.1%) over the entire study period, and a log -rank test indicates that the hazard rate is significantly lower i n the vaccinated cohort over this time interval (p = 5x10-40; Figure 2A ). The hazard rates were also significantly lower in the vaccinated group when considering SARS -CoV-2 infections with onset at 14 days after study enrollment (p = 1x10-28; Figure 2B ) or 28 days after study enrollment (p = 2.4x10-13; Figure 2C ). For the 263 vaccinated individuals who subsequently tested positive for SARS -CoV-2, the distribution of time from first dose to first positive SARS -CoV-2 PCR test is shown in Figure 3 . Starting 36 days after study enrollment (approximately two weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2 and one week after the second dose of mRNA -1273), the vaccinated and unvaccinated incidence rates were 0.071 and 0.43 case per 1000 person -days, respectively. This corresponds to a vaccine efficacy of 83.4% (95% CI: 60.2 -94.3%) ( Table 2 ). Importantly, we found that two of the six infections in the vaccinated cohort on or after day 36 occurred in individuals who had received only one vaccine dose, even though all vaccinat ed individuals should have received two doses by this time point per the manufacturer guidelines. Among the properly vaccinated individuals (i.e. those who had received both doses prior to day 36), the incidence rate of a positive SARS -CoV-2 PCR test was 0 .048 cases per 1000 person -days ( 4 cases in 82,686 person days), 88.7% (95% CI: 68.4 -97.1%) ( Table 2 ). We also assessed the rates of infection and estimated vaccine efficacy in six non - overlapping 7 -day intervals starting at the date of first vaccination. Even in the first seven days after study enrollment, vaccinated individuals had significantly lower infection incidence rates (0.48 cases per 1000 person -days) than unvaccinated individuals (1.0 cases per 1000 person - days), corre sponding to an efficacy ( Table 2 ). The vaccination efficacy then generally increased in subsequent weeks, reaching its maximum (92.5%; 95% CI: 70.2-99.1%) during the sixth week after study enrollment (days 36 -42) (Table 2 ). COVID -19 vaccines are associated with lower hospitalization rates post SARS -CoV-2 infection To assess whether vaccination also reduces illness severity, we compared 14 -day rates of hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality in COVID -19 patients who were vaccinated prior to diagnosis (n = 263) and 1 -to-10 propensity score matched unvaccinated COVID -19 patients (n = 2,630) (see Methods and Table 3 ). The vaccinated population showed a significantly lower 14 - day hospital admission rate (3.7% vs. 9.2%; Relati ve Risk = 0.4; p = 0.0074) ( Figure 4A , Table 4). On the other hand, ICU admission rates were similar between these cohorts (1% vs. 1.3%; .

In fact, none of the vaccinated patients who were subsequently diagnosed with COVID -19 have died, in cluding 59 with at least 28 days of follow -up (data not shown). Discussion Recent phase 3 trials have led to the authorization of two COVID -19 vaccines in the United States, and other vaccines have been approved in other countries or show promise for appr oval in the near future ( 7, 8). This study provides strong further evidence supporting the use of vaccination to prevent and reduce the severity o f COVID -19. While other real world analyses of COVID -19 vaccines are now emerging ( 22), a defined placebo group or adequately balanced unvaccinated cohort is difficult to ascertain outside of the clini cal trial setting. To address this challenge, we used propensity matching to generate cohorts of vaccinated and unvaccinated patients who are balanced for demographic, geographic, and social variables, and then evaluated the effect of vaccination on the ra te of SARS -CoV-2 positivity and COVID -19 severity between these cohorts. These vaccines, when administered as two serial doses, were 88.7% effective (95% CI: 68.4 -97.1%) in preventing SARS -CoV-2 infection with onset at least 36 days after the first dose. T his result is in line with the previously reported efficacies for symptomatic COVID -19 with onset at least 28 or 42 days after the first dose, respectively ( 9, 10). That the efficacy observed in our study is slightly lower than those reported in the two corresponding randomized controlled trials should be interpreted cautiously and contextually, as there are several plausible reasons for this. First, the 95% confidence intervals of all three efficacy estimates are highly overlapping, consistent with the true efficacies not being meaningfully different f rom each other. Second, due to distribution guidelines that are in place for Phase 1a of the vaccine rollout ( 11), individuals at high risk for acquiring COVID -19 (e.g., healthcare workers and residen ts of long term care facilities) are expected to be overrepresented in this vaccinated cohort. This could lead to an underestimation of vaccine efficacy, as the propensity matched unvaccinated group is likely composed of lower -risk individuals despite bein g matched for age, sex, race, ethnicity, and the number of prior SARS -CoV-2 PCR tests. Third, the likelihood of exposure to SARS -CoV-2 may be dependent on vaccination status to a greater extent in the real world than it is in the context of a randomized tr ial. That is, vaccinated individuals may feel more comfortable participating in social situations that pose a higher risk for infection, whereas this bias did not exist by definition in the context of the observer -blinded clinical trials. The incidence ra tes of SARS -CoV-2 infection in both our vaccinated and unvaccinated cohorts (113 and 292 cases per 1000 person -years, respectively) are notably higher than the COVID -19 incidence rates reported in the placebo groups of both the BNT162b2 and mRNA -1273 trials (69.1 and 79.7 cases per 1000 person -years, respectively), but there are also several explanations for this observation. First and most importantly, in contrast to both clinical trials, our outcome of interest is only a positive SARS -CoV-2 PCR test (with no requirement for presence of any clinical symptoms), whereas the phase 3 trials were designed to study symptomatic COVID - .

Given that over 40% of COVID -19 cases may be asymptomatic ( 23, 24), we know that the rates of SARS -CoV-2 PCR positivity would have been higher than the rates of symptomatic COVID -19 in both trials. This discrepancy in measured outcomes may also contribute to the slight differences in estimated efficacy addressed previously. Second, due to overrepresentation of high -risk individuals in the vaccinated cohort as described above, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the infection incidence was positively skewed in thi s study. Our finding that hospitalization rates are lower in COVID -19 patients who were vaccinated prior to SARS -CoV-2 infection compared to propensity matched unvaccinated COVID -19 patients is consistent with the clinical trial results for both BNT162b2 and mRNA -1273 ( 9, 10). In the trial of BNT162b2, 30 cases of severe COVID -19 occurred, all of which were in the placebo group; and in the trial of mRNA -1273, 9 cases of severe COVID -19 occurred in the placebo group compared to only one in the vaccinated cohort. While the ICU admission and mortality rates were not significantly lower in our vaccinated population, this may be attributable to an inadeq uate number of patients with these outcomes in either group to date in our study. As more patients are vaccinated and follow -up time increases, we will update our analyses to determine whether vaccination can also reduce the risk of these outcomes. There a re several important limitations to consider in this study. First, while the cohort size was even larger than the cohorts studied in phase 3 trials, the mean follow -up time per patient is substantially lower (mean = 27.1 days versus approximately 80 to 90 days). Consistent with this, approximately 45.1% of our vaccinated cohort had received only one dose of vaccination at the time of this study ( Table S1 ). We were thus limited in the number of patients and at -risk person - days that were available for the cri tical long term efficacy analyses. Second, we did not assess vaccine -associated adverse events, nor did we compare the clinical symptomatology of COVID - 19 infections between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. Third, it is possible that the likelihood of seeking out a SARS -CoV-2 PCR test was different between vaccinated and propensity matched unvaccinated patients, which could introduce bias into our estimates of vaccine efficacy. Indeed, vaccinated patients may feel less compelled to undergo subsequent PCR testing, thereby reducing the number of positive tests recorded in this group. However, our data suggests that this is likely not a strong confounding factor, as the fraction of vaccinated patients with at least one PCR test after study enrollment (13.9 %) was only marginally lower than the same fraction of unvaccinated patients (16.6%) ( Table S1 ). Finally, the cohorts utilized to assess vaccine efficacy were predominantly female (vaccinated: 62.2%; unvaccinated: 64.8%). As vaccine distribution expands in the coming months, we will be able to analyze cohorts which are more balanced for sex and to robustly assess vaccine efficacy in males and females separately. Our data demonstrates a strong real world effect of COVID -19 vaccination on par with the results reported in each randomized trial. This study also provides additional information which could not be ascertained from either trial, including the conclusions that (1) vaccination is effective in individuals who are at highest risk for acquiring COVID -19, and (2) vaccination reduces the rate of SARS -CoV-2 infection as defined by a positive PCR test alone. In summary, we emphasize that COVID -19 vaccines should be administered as broadly and rapidly as possible to the public and that the real world efficacy of these vaccines should be continuously monitored as we move beyond Phase 1a of the distribution process. .

Schematic illustrating the algorithms for participant selection and outcome assessment. (A) Design of study to compare SARS -CoV-2 infection rates in patients receiving COVID -19 vaccination compared to 1 -to-1 propensity matched unvaccinated patients (n = 3 1,069 per group). For each group, incidence rates were calculated to assess the efficacy of vaccination in preventing SARS -CoV-2 infection, as defined by a positive PCR test, with onset at least 36 days after the first dose or the date of study enrollment. Several other time windows were also evaluated for vaccine efficacy. (B) Design of study to compare COVID -19 disease severity in patients who were vaccinated prior to diagnosis with COVID -19 and had at least 14 days of follow -up after diagnosis (n = 191) versus 1 -to-10 propensity matched unvaccinated patients with at least 14 days of follow -up (n = 2,348). Severity outcomes (hospitalization, ICU admission, and mortality) were assessed within 14 days of PCR diagnosis. .

Cumulative proportional incidence of SARS -CoV-2 infection with onset on any day after the date of first vaccination (A), after 14 days from the date of first vaccination (B), or after 28 days from the date of first vaccination (C), against a 1 -to-1 matched unvaccinated control cohort. A log -rank test rejects the null hypothesis of equal hazard rates with p -values of 5x10-40 (A), 1x10-28 (B), and 2.4x10-13 (C). Note that the x -axis of (B) ranges from 14 to 42 d ays (following the first vaccine dose), and the x -axis of (C) ranges from 28 to 42 days (following the first vaccine dose). .
