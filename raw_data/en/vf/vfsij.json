What is the best response during a pandemic? 2INTRODUCTIONHow does the body fight an infection? 3The immune system protects the body against infections and illness.\u00a7The immune system recognizes germs, bacteria and viruses. It responds by creating proteins called antibodies.\u00a7Antibodies fight infection, help a person recover and prevent a person from becoming ill in the future.Vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to make antibodies.\u00a7They help our body develop immunity to a virus without getting an illness.\u00a7They train the immune system to recognize and fight viruses or bacteria. INTRODUCTIONHow were the COVID-19 vaccines shown to be safe? 4INTRODUCTION 5Was the vaccine made too quickly?INTRODUCTIONNo.Scientists all around the world worked together to develop safe and effective vaccines to stop the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly as possible. Each vaccine was developed and tested following the same rules as other medications and vaccines that have been approved for use, such as antibiotics and the flushot. PHOTO:ISTOCKPHOTO6How was the U.S. government involved?INTRODUCTION The vaccine was created by expert scientists. It was not created by the government.The U.S. government provided money and support to assist in the production and distribution of the vaccine.7COVID-19 VaccineInformationGeneral Questions8GENERALQUESTIONSWhat COVID-19 vaccines are authorized for vaccinesauthorized for emergency useby the FDA:\u00a7Pfizer-BioNTech(mRNA)\u00a7Moderna (mRNA)\u00a7Johnson & Johnson (Viral Vector)Emergency use authorization (EUA) is a way for the FDA to make vaccines and treatments available to the public under emergency circumstances, such as a pandemic.The vaccines were studied at different time points during the pandemic and in different settings. All three are effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 infection. There are other vaccines in various stages of clinical development.9GENERALQUESTIONSHow is the vaccine administered? Both the Pfizerand Modernavaccines aregivenin twoshots. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is given in one shot. The vaccine is given asan injection into themuscle.Pfizerdoses are given21 days apart.Modernadoses are given 28 days apart.If receiving Pfizer or Moderna, you must receivethesame vaccineforbothdoses. 10GENERALQUESTIONSHow effective arethe COVID-19 vaccines?AccordingtodatacollectedandreleasedbytheFDA... The PfizerandtheModernavaccinesareabout95%effectiveatpreventing symptomatic COVID-19 illness about 2 weeks after the second dose is received.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is about 85% effective at preventing severe COVID-19 illness 28 days after vaccination. 95% 85% 100%All authorized vaccineswere 100% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths related to COVID-19 in clinical trials.11GENERALQUESTIONSHow dothe mRNACOVID-19 vaccineswork? (Pfizer and Moderna)SARS-CoV-2 is the virus thatcausesCOVID-19. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines contain genetic instructions that tell your body to produce a \"spike\" protein.Your immune system recognizes this protein as a threat and produces antibodies. These antibodies later block the SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering your cells.If the virus cannot enter your cells, it cannot reproduce and make yousick. Antibody HumancellSARS-CoV-212GENERALQUESTIONSShouldIbeworriedaboutanmRNAvaccine?No.Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccinetechnology, used in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, is new, but notuntested or unknown.While this is the first time mRNA has beenused in a vaccine, the structure and technology has been studied foryears.Advancements in biology and chemistryhave improved mRNA vaccine safety and efficacy, and it is now thought to be less dangerous when compared to other types ofvaccines.mRNA 13GENERALQUESTIONSWhat are theingredients in the mRNA you COVID-19.\u00a7Do notaffect your DNA. \u00a7mRNA never enters the nucleus of the cell, where DNA is located.\u00a7The cell breaks down and gets rid of the mRNA soon after it is finished using the instructions.\u00a7Do notcontain eggs, preservativesor mercury.MessengerRNA (mRNA)The active ingredient in the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that causes your body toproduce antibodiesLipidsThesecreate the fattyshell that protects the mRNAas it other compoundsTo maintain the proper andstabilizethevaccine 14GENERALQUESTIONSWhat are the ingredients in the mRNA vaccines? Ingredients for all COVID-19 vaccines arelisted on the FDA website. 15GENERALQUESTIONSHow does the viral vector vaccinework?(Johnson & Johnson)\u00a7The Johnson & Johnson vaccine uses what's known as \"viral vector\" technology. This means a harmless (inactivated) cold virus is engineered to contain the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 \"spike\" protein. Once someone gets this shot, their body mounts an immune response and produces antibodies that prevent them from a future severe COVID-19 infection.The vaccine cannot give you COVID-19 or the common cold.\u00a7The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is delivered as a single dose. \u00a7The Johnson & Johnson vaccine does notneed to be transported frozen. This means it is easier to store and distribute.16GENERALQUESTIONSWhat are the Johnson & Johnson vaccine'singredients?The active ingredient in the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is a harmless (inactivated) cold virus, engineered to contain the gene for the SARS-CoV-2 \"spike\" protein. The other ingredients maintain the pH and stabilize the solution. Full ingredient list: \u00a7Recombinant, replication-incompetent adenovirus vaccines contain aborted fetal cells?No.The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain aborted fetal cells. However, Johnson & Johnson did use fetal cell lines \u2014not fetal tissue \u2014when developing and producing their vaccine, while Pfizer and Moderna used fetal cell lines to test their vaccines and make sure that they work.Fetal cell lines are grown in a laboratory and were started with cells from elective abortions that occurred several decades ago in the 1970s-80s. They are now thousands of generations removed from the original fetal tissue. We understand this is a sensitive issue, and specifically important to religious communities. However, the California Catholic Conference noted in an official statementthat they support the use of all COVID-19 vaccines to prevent the continued spread of COVID-19, and the Vatican issued a statementsaying it is morally acceptable to receive COVID-19 vaccines that have used cell lines from aborted fetuses in their research and production process.18Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?GENERAL QUESTIONSThe FDA has confidently said the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are safe, and has authorized them for emergency use. People who receive the vaccine will be monitored to check for safety, and participants in the original clinical trials will be followed for two years. NURSE NICOLE CHANG, ONE OF THE FIRST UCLA HEALTH EMPLOYEES TO GET THE COVID-19 VACCINE. (DEC. 16, 2020)19GENERAL QUESTIONSWhat are potential side effects to receiving vaccine?Mild symptoms are common when the body produces antibodies, and are not a sign of infection. Side effects are generally mild and went away after a day or two. They were more pronounced after the second dose.As with any vaccine, there is a low chance of allergic reaction. If a patient has a history of severe allergic reaction to other vaccines, they should talk to their doctor.In ongoing clinical trials, themost common side effectsincluded:\u00a7Pain at the injectionsite\u00a7Fatigue\u00a7Headache\u00a7Muscle pain\u00a7Chills\u00a7Jointpain\u00a7Mildfever20How long willI have immunity after vaccination?We don't knowyet.Clinical studies have so far followed patients for only a few months after vaccination. Patients in the studies will eventually be followed for two years. After that, we should know more about how long immunity lasts.GENERAL QUESTIONS 21GENERAL QUESTIONSWe don'tknow.Clinical trials tested the vaccine'sability to prevent symptomatic COVID-19 disease in vaccinated individuals.The trials did not test if vaccinated individuals could still become infected with COVID-19 or transmit the illness.CanIcatchandtransmitCOVID-19afterIamvaccinated?Basedonexperience with other vaccines and early data, it is likely that if people who get the vaccine become sick with COVID-19, they would have few or no symptoms and would not pass the virus to others. Researchers will continue to study this. 22COVID-19 VaccineInformationWho Should Get theVaccine?23Should I get the disorder \u00a7You on blood thinners\u00a7You are pregnant or plan tobecome pregnant\u00a7You are breastfeeding\u00a7You are immuno-compromised\u00a7You are on a medication that affects your immune system\u00a7You have afeverYou should notget the vaccine if you have had a severe allergic reaction to:\u00a7any ingredient in the vaccine, or\u00a7a previous dose of thevaccine24ShouldIstillbevaccinatedifIalreadyhadCOVID-19?Yes.\u00a7You should still get the COVID-19 vaccine if you have already recovered. \u00a7There is not currently enough information available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again.\u00a7You cannot receive the vaccine if you have an active COVID-19 infection.WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE? 25Is it bettertogetvaccinatedorcontract thevirusnaturally? Itisbettertogetvaccinated.The vaccine won't make you sick. It will help your body produce antibodies to keep SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, from later infecting your cells. WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE? Getting the actual COVID-19 virus can make you very sick and, in some cases, can be deadly.Getting the virus naturally can also cause both direct damage to your cells andinflammation, which can harm your entirebody.Vaccine is madeFirst injection is givenAntibodies are builtSecond injection is given (Pfizer and Moderna)Protection is strengthened 26Whygetthevaccineifmostdon'tdiefromCOVID-19?\u00a7As of March 2021, COVID-19 has killed more than 510,000 people in the United States. \u00a7This is significantly more deaths than other viruses that we routinely vaccinate against, such as influenza, which according to the CDC typically causes 24,000to 62,000 deaths in the U.S. peryear.\u00a7In addition to the high death toll, COVID-19 can also cause other long-term complications. The COVID-19 vaccine will save lives and decrease the likelihood of long term COVID-related problems involving the brain, heart andlungs.U.S. the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines appear to work as intended against the B.1.1.7 variant. \u00a7All authorized vaccines, while less effective against the B.1.351 and P.1 variants, still offer significant protection. There are several variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that scientists are actively tracking, including:28WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE?Whenarevaccinesexpectedtobeofferedto children?We don't know.\u00a7The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for people 16 and older. \u00a7The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccinesareauthorized for people 18 and older. \u00a7Before a vaccine can be offered to children under 16, clinical trials must be run in different age groups to test its safety and effectiveness.\u00a7Pfizer and Moderna are currently running clinical trialsin kids12 and older that will be completed in 2021.\u00a7No clinical trials have been announced for kids under12. 29COVID-19 VaccineInformationDistribution30Who will receive the COVID-19 vaccination first?The State of California requires that the vaccine be made available first to thosefacing the greatest risk. This includes healthcare workers, nursing facility residents, people 65 and older, and now essential workers in education and childcare, emergency services and food and agriculture.UCLA Health is following LA County Public Health's direction and guidance to ensurean equitable and orderly vaccination scheduling process.DISTRIBUTION 31DISTRIBUTIONWhat is UCLA Health's vaccine distributionplan?The state, LA County and the CDC haverecommended a tieredapproach to determine the order in which the vaccine will be distributed. The vaccine supply is being prioritized as follows:Healthcareworkersand long-term care facility staff and residentsPeople age 65 and olderGeneralpublic (those not in groupslisted)Workers in essential industriesPeople age 16-64 with high-risk medical conditions32CanIchoosewhichvaccineIwillreceive?No.While UCLA Health will receive several vaccines produced by differentmanufacturers, we do not foresee that patients will be able to choose.For vaccines with a two dose series, it is important that you receive the same vaccine for both doses, as vaccines cannot be \"mixed.\" That means if you receive the Pfizer vaccine for your first dose, you must receive thePfizer vaccine for your second dose. The same is true for the Modernavaccine.DISTRIBUTION 33Will the COVID-19 vaccine be mandatory?No.Just like getting the flu shot is not mandatory, getting the COVID-19 vaccine will not be mandatory either. However, it is highly encouraged as a way to protect yourself and those aroundyou.WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE? PHOTO:U.S. SECRETARY OF DEFENSE34COVID-19 VaccineInformationLife AfterVaccination35WillIneedtowearamaskaftervaccination?Yes.The CDC still recommends wearing a well-fitted mask in public and when visiting with unvaccinated people that are at a high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. This includes unvaccinated household members of people that are high risk for severe COVID-19 disease. Fully vaccinated people should also avoid medium and large sized in-person gatherings.LIFE AFTERVACCINATIONFully vaccinated people can: \u00a7Visit with other fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks\u00a7Visit with unvaccinated people from a single household who are at low risk for severe COVID-19 disease without wearing masks\u00a7Refrain from quarantine and testing following a known exposure, if asymptomatic36Will I need to quarantine after vaccination?LIFE AFTER VACCINATIONAccording to CDC guidance from Feb. 10, fully vaccinated people who meet criteriawill no longer be required to quarantine following an exposure to someone with COVID-19. Criteria include: \u00a7Are fully vaccinated, meaning it's been 2 weeks since they received their second vaccine dose in a 2-dose series -or-since they received a single-dose vaccine\u00a7Are within 3 months following receipt of the last dose in the series\u00a7Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposureThere may be additional considerations for patients and residents in health care settings.37Should I wear twomasks instead of just one? One or two masks?\u00a7CDC has updated recommendationson this topic, noting that not all masks provide the same protection.\u00a7One option is to wear one quality mask with at least two layers of fabric worn properly. \u00a7Another option is to double mask with a disposable mask worn underneath a cloth mask, paying attention to proper fit and coverage. \u00a7Proper fit means it should completely cover your nose and mouthand fit snuglyagainst the sides of your face and under your chin, without gaps.LIFE AFTERVACCINATIONWhat type of mask is best?\u00a7N95 respirators should only be used in health care settings. \u00a7Wear a double layer cotton mask, a surgical mask or a mask with two layers and a filter.\u00a7You should never wear a mask with an exhalation valve, vents or holes, which would allow virus particles to escape.\u00a7Face shields are not a substitute for a maskMarch 15, 2021March 15, 202139COVID-19 VaccineInformationAdditional Slides40Can the vaccine cause autoimmune problems?ADDRESSINGCONCERNSNo.There is no evidence that the COVID-19 vaccine will cause autoimmune problems. The immune response caused by the vaccine only targets the spike protein of the virus, not the other cells in your body.Spikeprotein Human cellsAntibodies prevent thevirus from attaching itself to thebodySARS-CoV-241Can the COVID-19 vaccine cause infertility or sterility?No.There's absolutely no evidence that the vaccine interferes with fertility orpregnancy.The vaccine expresses one protein of the virus, which causes your immune system to respond against that specific protein. This is something ourbody is used to \u2014it happens everyday.ADDRESSING CONCERNS PHOTO:NEPHRON 42Canthevaccineimpact results?Yes.Any type of vaccination can mammography results. Here's what you need to know: \u00a7When you get the COVID-19 vaccine or any other vaccination, the normal immune response may cause you to develop swollen lymph nodes under the arm in which you received the injection.\u00a7Swollen lymph nodes under the arm can be seen on a mammogram and can be a rare sign of breast cancer.\u00a7Swollen lymph nodes from a vaccination are normal and likely to normalize after about four weeks. Based on this information, the current recommendation from the Society of Breast Imagingis that anyone due for a screening mammogram either schedule it before their COVID-19 vaccination or at least four weeks after vaccination. If that isn't possible, just let your make sure to let your doctor know when you received your COVID-19 vaccination so they can note that information on your medical record.ADDRESSING CONCERNS43CanIreceivethevaccineifIhaveaweakimmunesystem?ADDRESSINGCONCERNSIn most cases,yes.People with medical problems can and should receive the vaccine if they do not have a severe allergy to the ingredients in the vaccine. This includes people living with HIVand autoimmune disorders, such as Lupus, as well as people with other medical problemsthat lead to a weakened immunesystem.If you have questions, please talk to yourdoctor. PHOTO: GETTYIMAGES44CanIgetthevaccineifI'mpregnantorplantoconceive?Yes.However, you should talk to your OB or primary doctor first to discuss the risks and benefits of vaccination. While there is no reason to worry that getting the COVID-19 vaccine will affect your pregnancy, there will likely be some warning about getting the vaccine while pregnant, since pregnant women were not included in clinicaltrials.While the vaccine is not a concern,pregnant women are at increased risk for serious disease if they getCOVID-19.WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE? 45Yes.The COVID-19 vaccine should be offered to people who are lactating/breastfeeding. Although lactating individuals were not part of the vaccine clinical trials, basedonexperience with other vaccines, the benefits of vaccine outweigh any safety concerns.You do not have to delay or stopbreastfeeding if you receive the COVID-19vaccine.CanIgettheCOVID-19vaccineifIambreastfeeding?WHO SHOULD GET THEVACCINE? PHOTO: WENDY WEI FORPEXELS46CanIwaitto be vaccinated?DISTRIBUTIONIt is important to get the vaccine when it is offered to you. People at greatest risk will be given the vaccine first.If you are concerned about potential long-term side effects, please note that all previous vaccine studies show that serious vaccine-related side effects normally occur within 6-8 weeks(2 months)afteravaccine shot. Approximately 100,000 people receivedthe vaccine more than 6months ago and there have been no serious sideeffects.Getting the vaccine willkeep you and people around yousafe.
