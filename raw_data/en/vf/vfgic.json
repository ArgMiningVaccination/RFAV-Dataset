It may take months and even years before someone is ready to send and /or receive correspondence from the donor family. It is normal to experience a wide range of feelings when communicating with or receiving information from a donor family. Those feelings may include excitement, guilt, anxiety or fear. We support you and whatever decision you make about communicating with your donor family. Some recipients may feel very happy to receive the correspondence from the donor family. Others may feel overwhelmed and find it difficult to express their thanks. Writing to your donor family does not mean you will get a response back. Some donor families may feel that writing about their loved one and their decision to donate helps them in their grieving process. Others choose not to write to the organ recipient. If the donor family chooses to write they will send a letter to the Organ Procurement Organization, OPO. The OPO will then forward the letter to your transplant social worker. Your social worker will call you or see you in clinic before the letter is sent to you. Please know that often donor families include a photograph of the donor. Your social worker will talk with you about whether a photo is included. It is common for recipients to imagine what their donor looked like, how old they were, and how they died. Often the reality is different from what is imagined. Your transplant social worker is available to talk with you about your feelings regarding this sometimes emotional experience. When the transplant recipient is a child, these issues can become more challenging for the child, parents/guardians and siblings. The information regarding the donor may be more difficult to process if the donor was also a child. It may impact each member of the family differently. Children have unique coping and adjustment needs. This process of learning about their organ donor may impact their behavior, sleep, school performance, and other social needs depending on their age. Your social worker can talk with you to make sure that you help your child learn about this information in developmentally appropriate ways. They can also provide the parents/guardians with adequate support about the process.38 | Resources Writing to Your Donor Family Have you ever wondered how you could thank the family that made your transplant possible? The decision to write to your donor family is a personal choice. It may help you to know that donor families consistently express gratitude by hearing from their loved one's recipients. Some recipients will choose to write to their donor family and others will not. There is no time limit to write to your donor family but requires thoughtful consideration. Your transplant social worker is available to talk to you if you are having difficulty with your feelings. If you do not wish to write at this time, feel free to wait or have a family member write on your behalf. You may also consider sending a Thank You or Thinking of You card. Writing to your donor family does not mean you will get a response back as some donor families never write. Suggestions: Write about yourself - your hobbies, family, friends, interests, etc. Please consider not including religious comments in your letter, as the religious background of the donor family may be unknown. Write about your personal transplant experience - how long you waited, how the transplant affected your life. Thank the family for your Gift of Life and express your sympathy to them for their loss. Sign only your first name and do not include any identifying information. Sending your correspondence: Place your card or letter in an envelope, unsealed. On a separate piece of paper write your full name, date of transplant and organ you received. Place all in an envelope and mail to: Gift of Life Michigan 3861 Research Park Drive Ann Arbor, Ml 48108 As time passes and if the donor family and recipient both agree , they can correspond directly and/or meet in person. These arrangements are made through Gift of Life and both parties must sign a release of information form. Please contact Gift of Life Michigan if you have any questions at (734) 922-1028 .Resources | 39 39 | ResourcesImportance of Having a Local Nephrologist The University of Michigan Transplant Center requires that all patient who are six months post-transplant have a local nephrologist that they see on a regular basis. Typically patients return to their referring nephrologist. However, if for some reason you do not want to go back to that doctor, we do ask that you find another nephrologist close to your home. If you do not have a local nephrologist, please let us know and we can help you find someone in your area. In addition to your local nephrologist, you will also see your University of Michigan transplant nephrologist one to two times a year. Reasons we require you to have a local nephrologist: If you get sick and are admitted to a local hospital, your local nephrologist will be aware of your transplant and have regular and ongoing communication with the UofM transplant team. This will help make sure you receive the best care possible in your community or local hospital. Your local nephrologist wants to see you. They were there from the start and want to see how you are doing after transplant. We want to provide the best care possible to you. Having strong relationships with nephrologists across the state allows us and them to keep you and your kidney healthy. If you cannot get to Ann Arbor, it is important to have someone in your community that knows you and your health history. Your nephrologist and our team can communicate over the phone and determine what is best for you. Policy Regarding New Patient Evaluations at the Outreach Clinics Our outreach clinics are intended to provide a closer geographic clinic location for patients who live a long distance from Ann Arbor. We provide both new patient evaluations and annual pre kidney transplant update visits at our outreach locations. Post-transplant clinics are also available quarterly at outreach locations. Once we receive a referral for a new evaluation, we will offer new patients the option of coming to an outreach clinic for evaluation based on their geographic location. Some new evaluation patients may be required to come to Ann Arbor for their evaluation. Some examples may be: A new evaluation patient has 4 or more years of dialysis time A new evaluation patient who has a previously closed evaluation A new evaluation patient who wants to coordinate their evaluation with other testing on the Ann Arbor campus A new evaluation patient who previously missed their evaluation appointment at an outreach clinic40 | Resources Policy Regarding Pre-Kidney Transplant Visits for Patients Seen in the Outreach Clinics For patients who were seen for their transplant evaluation at an outreach clinic, some of your annual pre-kidney transplant visits may be in Ann Arbor. Making the trip to Ann Arbor will give you and your support person the opportunity to see our outpatient clinic, become familiar with the Ann Arbor hospital campus and know the driving route from your home to the hospital. After you have had one pre-kidney transplant clinic visit in Ann Arbor, the remainder of your pre kidney transplant update visits can be at the outreach clinics UNLESS the team requires that you come to Ann Arbor for a medical, surgical or psychosocial reason. Your coordinator will talk with you about your pre kidney transplant clinic appointment plan.

The mentors of the program are patients who have already successfully gone through transplant. Many find it helpful and reassuring to talk with those that have first-hand knowledge about the transplant experience. The word mentor refers to one who is an advisor or teacher. The peer mentors play many different roles. They listen to fellow patients, strive to instill confidence, provide encouragement and help patients confront challenging issues and emotions. Mentors are expected to maintain confidentiality of patient information. Peer Mentor Program Goals Provide information, guidance and emotional support to those involved in the transplant process Offer a network of peers to help those experiencing the process to not feel alone Encourage patients to stay active before and after transplant What is the Role of the Peer Mentor? After peer mentors go through training, they work closely with the University of Michigan Transplant Center Outreach Program. In their role, peer mentors enhance patient care by: Providing peer support. Mentors provide patients with support through telephone calls, visits, mail or e-mail. Participating in Transplant Expos at dialysis centers across Michigan and speaking with patients considering transplant or those currently on the waitlist. Answering questions and sharing their story at the Kidney Transplant Patient Education Class. Providing helpful transplant information. Mentors share their own experiences from a peer perspective. This one-on-one communication with another transplant patient offers both an individualized and highly personal account of the transplant process. Helping patients work with the transplant team. The importance of working well with the transplant team is important. Because of their personal experience, mentors can help patients learn the best ways to interact productively with the transplant team.42 | Resources Providing support and encouragement to comply with taking prescribed medications. Strict compliance with medications is critical to a positive outcome for transplantation. Mentors offer support and encouragement in this process. Teaching the community about organ donation and sharing their personal experience. The Mentor Program is entirely voluntary and is offered to all transplant candidates and their families during the formal evaluation phase.

A: You can and should resume working as soon as you are physically able to do so. Most individuals can return to work between four and 12 weeks following transplant. You may ask the doctor when in clinic for specifics based on how you are doing and your job duties. Q: When can I drive? A: You may begin driving after you are off narcotic pain medications, you feel well enough to do so, and it has been at least three weeks since your operation. You should always wear your seatbelt for protection. Q: When can I have sex? A: You may resume sexual activity as soon as you feel comfortable doing so, keeping in mind the limitations on strenuous activity. Q: When can I travel? A: It is recommended that you do not travel for 12 weeks following surgery. It is imperative that you maintain your schedule of follow-up appointments and lab draws. Be mindful that the transplant team may need to communicate with you following their review of your lab results. Limited travel may be permitted if special arrangements are made before the travel. Q: When can I have a baby? A: Female transplant recipients are able to get pregnant and have a baby. Pregnancy is not recommended for the first two years after transplantation. All pregnancies in transplant recipients should be considered high-risk and planned and managed preferably by both the transplant physicians and high-risk obstetrician. For more information, please refer to \"Pregnancy After Transplant\" on page 14 of the Post-Transplant section. Q: When can I adopt a baby? A: There are no restrictions on adoption, however, you may require assistance during the first six weeks following transplant due to lifting restrictions. Resources | 49 Q: Are there foods I should not eat? A: All patients should follow a low-salt, heart-healthy diet. No other restrictions apply, unless they are given specifically by the transplant team (e.g., low potassium). All patients should be aware that uncooked seafood or undercooked meat pose risks of disease. Do not eat raw fish, such as sushi or raw meat. Q: Can I have grapefruit or grapefruit juice? A: No, you cannot consume these if you are taking cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus because grapefruit interferes with blood levels of the medications. You should also avoid mixed fruit juices if they contain significant amount of grapefruit juice concentrate. Q: What about other fruits or fruit juices? A: You may drink orange, lemon, lime, tangerine, apple and cranberry juices. You should not eat star fruits because they may cause kidney toxicity in patients with poor kidney function. You should not eat pomelo because it is in the same family as grapefruit and it increases drug levels. For other fruits, very limited information is available. Some studies suggest that the following fruits may also cause fluctuations in drug levels: papaya, pomegranate and star fruit. Q: What about citrus sodas? A: Many citrus sodas include grapefruit juice concentrate at unknown quantity. It is hard to say how that will affect your medications. If they contain minimal amount of grapefruit juice for flavor only (such as grapefruit-flavored Sun-Drop and Fresca), they are unlikely to interfere with blood levels of cyclosporine, tacrolimus or sirolimus. However, if they contain significant amount of grapefruit juice concentrate, it is best to avoid them. Q: Can I drink alcohol? A: The use of alcohol is a personal decision. Although recent studies suggest that alcohol may have some health benefit if used in small amounts, drinking alcohol can be harmful for some people. Those who have heart failure, cardiomyopathy, high blood pressure, diabetes, arrhythmia (irregular heart rhythm), a history of sudden cardiac death or stroke, obesity, high triglycerides, or are taking medications should speak to their doctor before drinking alcohol. Also, if you are pregnant or have a history of alcoholism, you should not drink alcohol. If you do not already drink alcohol, you should not start drinking. If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Moderate drinking is defined as no more than one drink per day for women or lighter weight persons and no more than two drinks per day for men. One drink is equal to 2 oz. of hard liquor, 5 oz. of wine or 12 oz. of beer. 50 | Resources 50 | ResourcesQ: What pets can I not have? A: There are no absolute restrictions. As a general rule, cats, dogs and horses cause no concern. Be aware that intimate contact with cat or bird feces poses a risk of infection and these activities should be avoided or a mask worn, followed by washing your hands. Q: Do I need to limit my activities? A: For the first six weeks you should not lift anything over 10 pounds, which is approximately the weight of a gallon of milk. Do not do any straining or participate in sports for six weeks. In most cases, there are generally no restrictions after six weeks following surgery. Q: Can I play sports? A: Yes. There are no restrictions after the initial six week post operative period. Q: Are there jobs I should not have? A: You are encouraged to return to work and there are no restrictions regarding the type of work that can be done. We do recommend you follow universal health precautions, such as hand washing, if you work with small children who may be ill or work with animals in a pet shop or other setting. Q: Can I be around children following their vaccination? A: Transplant patients should avoid direct contact with persons who have received any live virus vaccines. Patients should also avoid direct contact with the body fluids (such as changing diapers) from a recently vaccinated individual. Examples of live virus vaccines include MMR (measles, mumps, rubella), small pox and chicken pox. Q: Can I be around a person who has received the flu-mist vaccine? A: The flu-mist vaccine is a live virus vaccine, therefore, transplant recipients should not be around a person who received the flu-mist vaccine for 21 days following the vaccination. Q: How long do I have to drink 2 liters of fluids per day? A: We recommend you drink two liters of fluid each day for four weeks, after which you should drink as thirsty.Resources | 51 Q: Do I need antibiotics before I see my dentist? A: Organ transplantation is not an indication for antibiotics before dental care. Antibiotics may be appropriate if you have a prosthetic value, a history of endocarditis, congenital heart disease, or a cardiac transplant with valvular disease. If you require antibiotics they will be prescribed at the discretion of your dentist. Q: Can I do gardening? A: Gardening is acceptable. We do recommend you wear gloves and wash your hands when finished and wear a HEPA filter mask when working with mulch or leaves. Q: I am an organ donor. Can I get pregnant and is it acceptable? A: Female organ donors are able to become pregnant. Pregnancy following organ donation is not a problem after the initial recovery period. Q: Can I use deodorant? A: Yes. Some trace aluminum can be found in antiperspirants which has caused some concern in specific patient populations. If you are concerned, please ask your doctor in clinic. Q: Can I use the same hand towels as my family? A: Yes. However, if a member of your family is ill you are advised to use universal health precautions. Q: Can I use the same bar of soap as my family? A: Yes. However, if a member of your family is ill you are advised to use universal health precautions. Q: Can I drink milk and have other dairy products? A: Yes. You need to include milk and eat dairy products in your daily diet. Q: Do I need to wear a mask at all times following transplantation? A: For more information on when a mask is recommended, please ask your transplant nurse coordinator. Q: Can I take over-the-counter cold or cough medications? A: Please contact your transplant nurse coordinator if you have questions.52 | Resources 52 | Resources Resources | 53 54 | Resources 54 | ResourcesADULT SOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION CURRENT : JUNE 13 , 2019 DUE FOR REVIEW : 2022 Michigan Transplant Center Policy #103 Recommended Vaccines for Adult Solid Organ Transplant Candidates and Recipients I. POLICY STATEMENT To define the recommendations for vaccines for Adults Solid Organ Transplant Can didates and Recipients and t o ensure vaccines based on specific exposure or risk when traveling. Note: I mmunosuppressed patients are not to receive live virus vaccines . II. PURPOSE None. III. DEFINITIONS VIS forms: Vaccine information Sheets provided to the patient prior to immunization. IV. STANDARDS A. Key Points Vaccines tend to be more effective in patients who are not immunosuppressed. Thus, if possible vaccines should be given prior to transplantation. Nonetheless, with the exception of live vaccines, most vaccines still work in immunosuppressed patients. Live vaccines (e.g., Zostavax shingles vaccine, varicella vaccine, MMR, and some travel vaccines) are contraindicated in immunosuppre ssed patients and shou ld not be given if transplant is expected in the next 4 weeks. Herpes zoster (shingles) is very common after transplantation. There are two zoster vaccines available: Zostavax (live zoster vaccine) and Shingrix (recombinant zoster va ccine). Transplant candidates and recipients 50 years of age should receive a zoster vaccine. Prior to transplant, Shingrix is recommended over Zostavax by the CDC and Michigan Medicine due to its superior efficacy. After transplant, Zostavax is contr aindicated and Shingrix is recommended based on response rate s and safety data . Patients who previously received Zostavax should be given Shingrix. Serious adverse events are rare after Shingrix , but 1-2 days of low grade fevers, shivering and flu like symptoms occur in a substantial minority of rec ipients. Influenza vaccination should be given every year regardless of recent transplantation. It is reasonable to wait 3 -6 months after transplantation to administer other vaccines as response will be bette r. High dose influenza vaccine appears to be safe after transplantation and is recommended for those 65 years of age and older. Administration of vaccinations is done by trained medical personnel (MA/RN/LPN) in the clinic setting after providing VIS inform ation (along with any additional information necessary ie: billing potential) to the patient . The operational process of vaccine administration can be found in the exhibit section of this policy . Due to incomplete vaccination coverage, outbreaks of measles have become more co mmon and measles can be severe in immunocompromised persons . During the listing process, as part of routine screening patients should be checked for previous immunity to rubella, rubeola antibody IgG\"). If patients are negative for any of the three viruses and not immunosuppressed , an additional dose of MMR should be administered. Patients with negative serologies can be vaccinated locally and a letter from the transplant center can be sent to the patient to describe options. Repeat serologies done at a minimum of 4-6 weeks after vaccination can be sent for any negative initial serolog y and if is still negative , a second dose can be administered. Candidates should be placed on hold for 4 weeks after receipt of MMR. Candidates in urgent need of transplant should not receive live vaccine since the risk of not receiving an organ outweighs the benefit of vaccination. B.

Do not administer if transplant anticipated within 4 weeks. f) Shingrix should be given to candidates or recipients 50 years as a 2 dose series at 0 and 2 -6 months. Zostavax is no longer recommended and is contraindicated after transplant. Patients who received Zostavax in th e past should be given Shingrix. g) Recommended for males and females age 9 through 26 years old ; 2-3 doses based on age at first vaccination, 3 dose s for immunocompromised patients Vaccine Pre-Vaccination Serology Recommended before Transplant Recommended after Transplant Post -Vaccination T iter Td (tetanus)b no yes yes (every ten years) no S. pneumonia (PPSV23)c (PCV13)d no yes yes no Varicella yes or history of chicken poxe yes if negative serology (contraindicated if immunosuppressed) contraindicated yes Zoster (Shingrix) (50 years and older)f (2 doses over 2 -6 months) Indicated for varicella positive yes Yes; Shingrix only no Human Papilloma Virusg No MMR Check Rubeola, Rubella, Mumps (IgG) all adults as part of listing process Yes No (live virus) Yes 4 -6 weeks after first dose and g ive second dose if negative 56 | Resources UNIVERSITY OF MICHIG AN TRANSPLANT CENTER POLICY #103 RECOMMENDED VACCINES FOR ADULT TRANSPLAN T CANDIDATES & RECIP IENTS JUNE 13 , 2019 PAGE 2 OF 2 C.
