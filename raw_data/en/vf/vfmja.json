Comprised of the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute and the Feinberg Cardiovascular Research Institute (FCVRI), the Heart Institutes at Northwestern Medi- cine represent the comprehensive approach of the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Memorial HealthCare. \"Our world-class experts at Bluhm and the FCVRI personify our commitment to ful- filling the Northwestern Medicine vision,\" said Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. \"Joining together, they will make the Heart Institutes at Northwestern Medicine a rec- ognized leader in cardiovascular medicine through clinical excellence and the discov- ery of innovative new therapies.\" The evening began with a scientific poster session showcasing the research of nearly two dozen members of the Heart about the broader perspective of North- western Medicine. This will include more clinical content such as in the feature story on page 14 in which four leaders talk about their roles in the new health system. Future issues will include Q&A articles with a variety of teams and leaders. Another change you'll see is with the Dean's Message, which now is entitled \"Northwestern Medicine Leadership\" and comprises a shared perspective; there will be times when we will write a joint message, as with this letter, and others where we may take turns offering our personal views on a specific topic more directly related to our unique positions. Of course, the magazine is just one of several vehicles to communicate the ascendancy of medical excellence in the national marketplace of ideas. In 2010 and 2011, the medical school and hospital began communicating under the North- western Medicine banner internally and externally. In September 2011, we launched the weekly electronic newsletter, \"My Northwestern Medicine,\" for alumni, faculty, staff/employees, and our partners and friends. And approximately three years ago, we started distributing Northwestern Medicine press releases to media about research findings, community outreach, clinical developments and new facilities. These various communications will assuredly evolve as we look to expand opportunities to shine a spotlight on Northwestern Medicine. Just this past fall in Chicago we debuted newly produced television and radio commercials, billboards, and digital ads highlighting Northwestern Medicine breakthroughs that contribute to excellent care and improved outcomes, as told through patient stories. You may also have seen print advertisements on a national scale. In 2014, we will be launching an enhanced version of our integrated website www.northwesternmedicine.org that will offer educational information about health conditions, one Physician Finder across the health system, as well as links to informa- tion about our specialty departments and scientific and academic missions. With all these activities, there should be no doubt that we greatly value our heritage, alumni, friends, and patients. Another highly visible element of our branding is evident in the signage for Northwestern Medicine at the recently opened outpatient facilities in Chicago's Lakeview neighborhood and the suburbs of Evanston, Libertyville, Glenview, Grayslake, Highland Park and Deerfield. In October 2014 we will also be opening the new Northwestern Medicine Outpatient Care Pavilion on the Chicago campus. This signals a change to patients and the national marketplace that we have a cohesive identity that brings together the hospital, medical practices, and the medical school. Consumers already think of the clinical, education and scientific endeavors underway at Northwestern as being completely linked; this new signage reinforces these relationships, leaving no room for doubt that we are all working together in support of an overarching mission to put \"Patients First.\" We look forward to sharing more momentous events as we advance a stronger, more unified Northwestern Medicine.

A number of biodegradable plastic versions are being tested across the country. \"This next-generation biodegradable stent releases nitric oxide, a natural re-storative molecule in the body, to promote vascular healing,\" Dr. Albaghadi said. \"While this project is advancing through preclini- cal trials, I am also engaged in clinical work with Mark Ricciardi, MD, associate profes- sor of medicine-cardiology, testing a stent that degrades over time and is ultimately completely absorbed by the body.\" The program featured presentations by Clyde Yancy, MD, chief of medicine-cardiol-ogy, who also served as emcee; Patrick McCarthy, MD, director of the Bluhm Cardiovascular Institute; Susan Quaggin, MD, director of the FCVRI; and Douglas Northwestern Medicine Leadership Campus News If you are a regular reader of the medical school's quarterly alumni magazine, known for the past 30 years as Ward Rounds, you will no doubt notice a few things have changed, starting with the publication name - now Northwestern Medicine Magazine. Rebranding this and many of the Feinberg School of Medicine and Memorial Hospital's other joint activities under Northwestern Medicine means more than just adopting a new name, logo and color palette. These changes signal a fundamen- tal shift in how we think about ourselves internally and present ourselves externally to our friends and alumni as new partners in an aligned academic health system. This shared identity includes speaking with one voice, working with unified goals and common culture, and developing new standards for outreach. Northwestern Medicine embodies at its core the intertwined elements of our scientific, clinical, and education missions, and acknowledges that we can be stronger and more nimble as we work to collaborate across a complex environment that comprises our extended family. Northwestern Medicine Magazine will showcase the superb progress being made across our academic health system. In addition to its familiar stories focused on research and traditional medical school activities, along with alumni news, now the publication will provide context and details Vaughan, MD, chair of medicine. \"We are a Chicago-based institution and we make no small plans,\" said Dr. Yancy, quoting famed architect Daniel Burnham. \"We believe that Northwestern Medicine is ideally suited to make a difference in health and disease by developing, introducing and perfecting leading-edge technologies that will treat the most advanced diseases.\" A panel discussion featured faculty members Robert O. Bonow, MD; Charles J. Davidson, MD; Neil J. Stone, MD; and applaud the leadership of Drs. Mc- Carthy, Quaggin, Yancy, Vaughan, and all of their colleagues for making the Heart Institutes at Northwestern Medicine a reality and ushering in a bold new era for Northwestern Medicine,\" said Dean M. Har- rison, president and chief executive officer of Northwestern Memorial HealthCare.

Students will also deliver this modern equivalent of the Hippo- cratic Oath four years from now during the graduation convocation. \"You have opened a new portal to your life's work that focuses on medicine and science very few are privileged to enter,\" said Eric G. Neilson, MD, vice president for medical affairs and Lewis Landsberg Dean. \"There are myriad exciting times ahead for you, not the least of which is working in a medical center, teaming with world-class hospitals.\" The program was the culmination of a week-and-a-half's events for new students, which included an Introduction to the Profes- sion Module, overview of the curriculum, team-building activities, and dinners with the dean and faculty. University President Morton Schapiro, PhD, urged each student to leave his or her own mark upon Feinberg. \"Think of yourself as having arrived as physicians,\" he said. \"You have all made many sacrifices to get here, so take a moment to be proud of Class of 2017 By the Numbers The Class of 2017 comprises 162 MD candidates. Among the 20 students pursuing dual-degrees, 12 are entering the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) and will receive both MD and PhD degrees.

In a burgeoning tradition, the coats were sponsored by 76 medical school alumni. (For full list of donors, see online story at magazine.northwestern-medicine.org.) \"There's definitely a connection with this moment, receiving our white coats, and the realization that we will now need to buckle down and really get ready to work hard,\" said Jordan Robinson, an incoming student from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \"I understand that I am not a doctor yet and it's easy to remain humble in that way, but there is definitely a sense of accomplishment in being at a prestigious university like Northwestern and slipping on the white coat for the first time.\" Founders' Day also served as the backdrop for numerous student honors given to members of the Class of 2016 who have made a positive impact in the community and displayed a level of leadership commended by their peers. Third-year student Paul Devlin, president of the Feinberg Student Senate, presented Addie Boone, Maggie Wright, KJ Hansmann, Allison Ducharme-Smith, and Maximilian Meyer with the Class of 2016 Student Senate Service Awards.

Nowadays, surgeons are more likely to remove enlarged adenoids and tonsils to treat sleep apnea and other forms of sleep disordered breathing (SDB). Studies show that SDBs can result in learning and behavioral problems including ADHD. While many children often breathe easier and return to normal function after the procedure, some patients continue to experience significant cognitive difficulties. It's the latter group that intrigues researchers at the University of Michigan. Following children ages 5 up to 13 over time, investigators Bruno Giordani, PhD, and Elise Hodges, PhD, hope to reveal the subtle problems that may be affecting the mental processes in this patient population. To assess cognition they are using the recently released NIH Toolbox\u2014a set of state-of-the-art tools developed by Feinberg School of Medicine's Richard Gershon, PhD. The vice chair of research and associate professor of medical social sciences led a six-year, NIH-funded study involving the collaboration of 235 scientists from nearly 80 academic institutions in the creation of the first common measurements for neurological and behavioral health. The NIH Toolbox was unveiled Sept. 10, 2012, to hundreds of researchers at a special National Institutes of Health conference. So far, interest has been high. \"Within the first 10 months of releasing the Toolbox, we fielded 800 online inquiries,\" says Gershon. \"Interestingly, 70 percent of them have been from clinicians looking for quick clinical assessment tools. For example, our 30-minute cognitive battery is equivalent to the traditional three-hour one.\" A TOOL FOR THE AGES Make it \"quick, free, and easy to use\" became the informal mantra of the NIH Toolbox team. Striving to enhance neuro- science research by improving data collection, the group of test development experts assembled by Gershon produced a compact yet powerful collection of no-cost assessment tools in English and Spanish. The Toolbox provides a unique \"common currency\" across diverse research projects and populations and has been validated across the entire lifespan in subjects from ages 3 to 85. Featuring a comprehensive set of measurements, the NIH Toolbox categorizes some 45 tests into four domains: cognition, sensation, motor, and emotion. Its standardized measures allow for easy comparison from study to study\u2014 one of the primary drivers for this project. If all goes according to the NIH's Blueprint GAINING ACCEPTANCE Across the country, the best minds in neuroscience came together via countless weekly conference calls over more than half a decade to create the contents of the Toolbox. Very much a homegrown project, Gershon tapped into the expertise of more than 30 Northwestern scientists and staff. Neuropsychologist Sandra Weintraub, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern, for for Neuroscience Research plan, the push to collect \"big data\" in clinical research will not get only bigger but also better thanks to the Toolbox. \"We need to make the most of our national investments by using the same testing instruments to help extract as much information as possible from a variety of research endeavors,\" says Molly V. Wagster, PhD, lead project officer for the NIH Tool- box study and chief of the NIH's Behavioral and Systems Neuroscience Branch, Division of Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging. \"Going forward, the Toolbox will help the NIH as well as others to do a better job of leveraging large studies.\" The NIH awarded its Toolbox project, in part, to Dr. Gershon for his expertise in computer adaptive testing (CAT). This advanced computer-based approach to test construction speeds up testing by reducing the number of questions while maintaining data collection reliability. CAT works by constantly adjusting questions to the test taker's abilities, with the same or better accuracy. Now the complete NIH Toolbox can be administered within a speedy two hours, which is a result of paring down a number of traditional \"gold standard\" measurements from hours to minutes. CAMPUS NEWS WRITTEN BY: Cheryl SooHoo Up to the Test: Researchers adding NIH Toolbox to study designsexample, chaired the NIH Toolbox Cognition Battery\u2014to date, the most popular of the measurements. She's not surprised. \"Assessing brain health is important to health in general,\" says Weintraub, re- nowned for her work in the area of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. \"Often cognitive impairment is a hidden factor that can have a huge impact on clinical outcome variables. Did patients not take their medications because they forgot? Or did they take their meds and not remember they took them?\" So far the NIH Toolbox has piqued the interest of the research community and is being used in prominent studies. These include the National Children's Study, co-led by Northwestern's Gershon and Jane Holl, MD, MPH, director of the Center for Healthcare Studies, to examine the health and development of children across the country, to the Human Connectome Project, a multicenter study based at Washington University in St. Louis focused on mapping human brain circuitry. In the case of clinical researcher Dr. Hodges, the NIH Toolbox has worked like a dream. \"With something this new, I figured there would be problems,\" she says. \"But it's been too good to be true. No problems. Really reliable and the technical support has been outstanding.\" 4 Domains 45 Comprehensive Measurements 2 Hour CompletionAttention Episodic Memory Working Memory Language Executive Function Processing SpeedAudition Vision Vestibular Olfaction Pain Taste Dexterity Strength Balance Endurance Locomotion Psychological Well-Being Stress and Self-Efficacy Social Relationships Negative Affect 8 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 9Northwestern Medicine scientists have successfully tested a nontoxic therapy that suppresses lupus in human blood samples, which may lead to a vaccine-like therapy that could keep the autoimmune disease in remission. The study was published online in Clinical Immunology. Lupus is a chronic condition that causes the body to create autoantibodies that attack and destroy healthy tissue and cause inflammation, pain and damage to the vital organs. According to the Lupus Foundation of America, five million people worldwide have a form of the disease. In past studies, Northwestern scientists showed that a nontoxic therapy (which uses synthetic peptides - small bits of protein - to generate special regulatory T cells) blocks lupus in mice. For this new study, the blood samples of 30 lupus patients (10 active and 20 in remission) and 15 healthy patients were cultured with low doses of the special peptides. \"We found that the peptides could not only generate regulatory T cells, but also that they block and reduce autoantibody produc- tion to almost baseline levels...,\" says Syamal professor of medicine-rheumatology and microbiology-immunology at the Feinberg School of Medicine. \"This shows that the peptides have the potential to work like a vaccine in the human body ... to keep the disease in remission.\" Dr. Datta hopes to move forward with a phase one clinical trial in humans to show the efficacy of the peptide therapy. Supported by funding from Alliance for Lupus Research (TIL grant #187305 to S.K.D.) and the National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases grant, R01AI41985 to S.K.D, and National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, P60 AR30692 to R. R-G) Scientists have been trying to solve the mystery of why one percent of people with HIV - called \"controllers\" - have lasting control of the virus without medications, in some cases for life. The controllers' early defense is quickly extinguished by the virus, so how do they have long-term immunity? Northwestern Medicine scientists have discovered a second line of defense, an extra helping of an immune protein that blocks HIV's spread. This suggests a novel approach involving much earlier treatment that could potentially make every HIV- infected person into a long-term controller by protecting the reserves of this protein, APOBEC3G, or A3 for short. Currently, most HIV patients need to take powerful anti-retroviral drugs daily for life. If the medicines are stopped, the virus quickly reactivates to harmful levels. \"Preserving and even increasing this defense in cells may make more HIV- infected persons into controllers and prevent HIV from rebounding to high and damaging levels when the medications are stopped,\" says Richard D'Aquila, MD, director of the Northwestern HIV Transla- tional Research Center. He is the senior Managing Cholesterol in People at Risk for Heart Attacks, StrokePutting Lupus in Permanent RemissionScientists Discover Clue to Controlling HIV Virus A new national guideline for managing blood cholesterol in people at risk of heart attacks and strokes changes the focus from aiming strictly for an ideal LDL - or, bad cholesterol level - to optimizing treatment intensity based on the individual. \"Some people want to put statins in the water; others don't want anybody to get a statin,\" says Neil Stone, MD, the Bonow Professor of Medicine at Feinberg School of Medicine and chair of the expert panel that wrote the guideline. \"Our goal is to treat more people appropriately with the right intensity of therapy.\" The cholesterol guideline to prevent atherosclerosis, hardening, and narrowing of the arteries, was published Nov. 12 by the Ameri- can College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy is recommended for the following groups: \u00bb Patients with cardiovascular disease \u00bb Patients with an LDL level of 190 mg/dL or higher \u00bb Patients with type 2 diabetes between ages 40 and 75 \u00bb Patients with an estimated 10-year risk of heart attack and stroke due to atherosclerosis (risk of 7.5 percent or higher) who are between ages 40 and 75 The panel found that statins are the most effective cholesterol- lowering drugs with the lowest rate of safety issues. Focusing on a healthy lifestyle along with a higher dose of statins eliminates the need for additional cholesterol-lowering medications. Research Briefs author of the study published Oct. 16 in the journal PLOS ONE. Dr. D'Aquila, the Howard Taylor Ricketts Professor of Medicine at the Feinberg School of Medicine and a physician at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, is working with colleagues to develop a drug to boost A3. He began investigating AIDS in 1982, the first year it was identified, and was a key figure in the development of anti-HIV medicines and resistance testing for the virus. Funding came from grant P30 AI 54999 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Cancer Institute, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute of Mental Health, and the National Institute on Aging. Other funding was from grant UL1 RR024975-01 from the former National Institute for Research Resource, which is now done by the National Center for Advancing Transla-tional Sciences. A new Northwestern Medicine study is the first to show that brain abnormalities predispose patients to chronic pain after a lower back injury. Based on MRI brain scans of people who had a new lower back injury, the scientists could predict with about 85 percent accuracy which patients' pain would persist. The predictor was a specific irregularity in the axons, pathways in the brain's white matter that connect brain cells so they can communicate. \"We've shown abnormalities in brain structure connections may be enough to push someone to develop chronic pain once they have an injury,\" says A. Vania Apkarian, PhD, senior author of the study and professor of physiology, anesthesiology, and physical medicine and rehabilitation.

Using brain imaging scans, researchers showed that those who used it daily for about three years as teens had differences in the thalamus, globus pallidus and striatum. These regions of the brain serve as working memory, helping people to solve puzzles, remember a telephone number or quickly process information for everyday tasks.

Cubbage The Chicago architectural firm of Perkins+Will has been selected to design a new Biomedical Research Building for the Feinberg School of Medicine on Northwestern University's Chicago campus. The new Biomedical Research Building will be located immediately east of the Lurie Medical Research Center on the site of the former Prentice Women's Hospital. Northwestern plans to construct appro- ximately 600,000 square feet of research space starting in 2015, with eventual build-out of approximately 1.2 million square feet.

Even though end-of-life directives had been in place since the 1970s, they fell into a grey area outside hospital settings. In fact, a lack of legal clarity surrounding DNRs actually prevented, by each state's policy, emergency medical services (EMS) professionals from honoring them. This ethical dilemma, in part driven by a flaw in the system of care, did not serve either patient or care provider well. So in 1992, James Adams, MD, current professor and chair of the Depart ment of Emergency Medicine at Northwestern Univer- sity Feinberg School of Medicine, conducted a state-by-state study investigating the application of DNRs in nonhospital environments. This work helped clarify the national picture, improve quality of care by expanding the scope of DNRs through legislation, and gave him keen insight into the power of enhancing systems to achieve the best patient outcomes. This early-career experience set him on a course to focus on healthcare systems to improve quality. It has also made him uniquely qualified as the newly appointed chief medical officer (CMO) for Northwestern Medicine. His goal: To do everything better to ensure the highest quality of care. \"We can trust that the current standard of care delivered at Northwestern is the best that has ever been provided, but that's not good enough,\" says Dr. Adams, who has headed emergency medicine since 2000 and led its transformation from a division to a department of medicine in 2004. \"This is an exciting time. We have the rare opportunity to create a high-quality, patient- centered, science-driven enterprise\u2014Northwestern Medicine. Few institu tions in the world are equipped to make the next research dis cov er ies lead ing to improved therapies and apply them in one coherent health care organization, and we will be one of them.\"New health system focuses on providing better care throughout all facilities.WRITTEN BY: Cheryl SooHoo PHOTOGRAPHY BY: Bruce Powell JOB ONEQuality \u2014 is \u2014 JAMES ADAMS, MD, CHAIR OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE AND CHIEF MEDICAL OFFICER FOR NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE, STILL TAKES ON SHIFTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO STAY CLOSE TO PATIENTS. 14 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 15FEATURE: QUALITY IS JOB ONE ALL TOGETHER NOW On September 1, 2013, the Northwestern Medicine partnership that was forged in 2009 between the Feinberg School of Medicine and Northwestern Memorial HealthCare (NMHC) took an important step forward. On that day, an aligned health system, called Northwestern Medical Group (NMG), was formed when the school-affiliated Northwestern Medical Faculty Foundation (NMFF) joined the Northwestern Memorial Physicians Group. With this union, NMG counts itself among one of Chicago's largest medical practices, with more than 1,000 physicians and other healthcare professionals. As Northwestern Medicine CMO, Adams and other leaders will put in place cohesive systems and structure to ensure that this aligned org anization provides optimal care, from the outpatient to the acute-care settings. While cultural clashes might seem in ev it able when bringing together what were once longstanding independent prac tice groups, Dr. Adams has no wor ries. \"The health system formation is not about a trade-off of values,\" he says. \"The cul ture is really already here to amplify and priori tize what we want and need to do to provide better patient experiences.\"Combining the clinical enterprise into one system follows the Northwestern Medicine strategic plan that was unveiled four years ago. The melding of the practice groups only further solidifies the common vision of the medical school and its affiliates moving forward. \"The alignment is about becoming greater than we were as separate entities by improving quality, reducing inefficiency, and expanding the care we provide,\" says Peter McCanna, named executive vice president and chief operating officer of Northwestern Medi-cine in September. \"By forming a single health system, we truly believe one plus one can equal three, four, or even five.\" Formerly Northwestern Memorial's chief financial officer, McCanna will now help to ensure that all divisions and affiliates op er ate at optimal performance: achiev ing patient satisfaction, employee engage ment, reliability, and efficiency goals; and that Northwestern Medicine meets the chal- lenges and opportunities of healthcare reform and other future trends. SITTING ROOM ALWAYS Deeply entrenched in the high-adrenaline environment of the emergency department (ED), Dr. Adams doesn't need to theorize about the pressures of those who provide and receive care. He's seen the chaos that can ensue when staff is short on time and patients wait in sometimes noisy and crowded conditions. At the frontlines of care, he has also benefited from process improvements. It's this perspective that energizes other Northwestern Medicine leaders involved in the clinical formation. \"He's not just an ivory tower thinker\u2014he knows how to get the job done,\" says Julie Creamer, senior vice president, Northwest- ern Memorial HealthCare. \"And that's a rare combination of skills.\" Leading a number of transition activi- ties for the new clinical enterprise, Creamer will work closely with Adams as the alignment process initially zeroes in on quality, culture and technology implemen- tation. In October, Northwestern Medicine created 12 formation teams that will get to the nuts and bolts of becoming a coordinated system. Key content areas range from the ambulatory patient experi- ence and clinical growth to communications and finance. Corporate-level functions have also been combined to create consistency across the entire health system; for example, Creamer will oversee a Business and Corporate Development group. Creamer has significant experience managing complex initiatives for North- western Medicine. She co-led the development of the strategic plan and its implementation through annual shared goals between the medical school and NMHC. \"Tapping into diverse expertise across campus has been key to our success,\" she says. \"Hundreds of individuals have participated in the strategies and goals, and we will replicate this approach as we form the health system. The talent and energy of the Northwestern community is an incredible asset, and together we will continue to achieve important outcomes.\" In his own sphere of influence, Dr. Adams has looked for ways to change processes to deliver excellent care. For him and those who follow his lead in the ED, listening to patients is essential to that mission. \"Listening can improve the diagnosis, which can help us, for example, avoid unnecessary testing,\" he explains. \"Also, informed patients are happier patients who know what to expect and are better able to participate in their own care.\" However, giving patients the opportu- nity to speak requires a system that allows time for physicians to have this type of interaction. If achieving productivity levels gets in the way of delivering patient-cen- tered care, then perhaps efficiencies need to be adopted, according to Adams. \"It's important to make sure the right tools are in place to achieve what you value as an organization,\" he says. \"In the ED, we make it a priority to listen to our patients by physically sitting down in the exam room. At the most basic level that may mean making sure there is a chair to sit on.\" In practice, quantifying quality that drives patient outcomes will result from col- lecting lots of data. Adams plans to use national care metrics, scientific evidence-based findings, and internal processes to develop standards to raise the quality bar. The ongoing feedback of patients, nurses, physicians and others involved in the clinical enterprise will provide reality checks. CULTURAL MIX A primary care physician receives the results of a patient's test: blood in the urine. Is it a contaminant? Repeat the test? Order a CAT scan? Involve a urologist? Which one? Today, these questions may arise for doctors practicing within the recently formed Northwestern Medical Group. In the future, as the health system alignment ramps up, quality systems will be implemented that will yield a much more efficient, best-of-care scenario. Based on quality models, that same physician might be advised to order a CAT scan and refer the patient to a specific clinic where an urologist who subspecializes in such abnormalities can quickly address the problem. At least, that's what David Mahvi, MD, James R. Hines Professor of Surgery and chief of gastrointestinal and oncologic surgery, envisions in his new role as NMG president. \"Throughout all the practice groups, there was a bit of dis-coor- dination of services. It wasn't always easy to figure out who at NMFF, for example, might be the perfect specialist for your patient's situation or which hospital you should send your patient to for treatment,\" says Dr. Mahvi. \"The clinical alignment will allow us to better coordinate care and grow our entire enterprise.\" His passion for healthcare system development as well active leadership with NMFF made Mahvi the right candidate to lead the JAMES ADAMS, MD, JULIE CREAMER, PETE MCANNA, AND DAVID MAHVI, MD, ARE MANAGING VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM ALIGNMENT.NMG. Now with one practice group on the same \"best patient experience page,\" the work begins for him and other system leaders to encourage everyone to think about quality. From his experience helping to integrate Lake Forest Hospital's surgeons and surgical services into the Northwestern Medicine family in 2010, Mahvi learned an important lesson. \"As long as our missions are aligned, everything works out great. \" At the end of the day, being at the top of industry performance will offer patients the latest diagnostic and treatment options. Examining inefficiencies and duplicated services will lead to more cost-effective, value-based care. (Already the wheels are in motion to implement one electronic medical records system, EPIC, in the ambulatory setting, which will allow for patients to receive one bill and facilitate communication among clinical care teams.) And truly listening to those who seek health services\u2014from the routine checkup to the latest therapy for a complicated condition\u2014will focus all clinical efforts toward patient-centered care. But Dr. Adams wants to takes this vision even further, deliver- ing service to patients and humankind. \"At Northwestern Medicine, we need to go beyond how we see ourselves in the everyday care of our patients, which is still vitally important and valued,\" he says, \"to becoming a place where individuals with complicated diseases turn to for hope that is real and accessible.\" He's not an ivory tower thinker\u2014he knows how to get the job done.

Now they share a vision as new leaders for the academic and clinical missions in neurology and neurosurgery. WRITTEN BY: Martha O'Connell PHOTOGRAPHY BY: Bruce Powell With global acclaim, both men had other options before them, but came to Northwestern because the medical school and hospital share their drive to provide the best possible care. They emphasize that they really do come to work thinking about every patient\u2014 from people with common to rare disorders \u2014whose only hope rests on novel thinkers who advocate for them and find treatments. Dimitri Krainc, MD, PhD, is the new chair of the Ken and Ruth Davee Department of Neurology and Aaron Montgomery Ward Professor. Andrew Parsa, MD, PhD, chairs the Department of Neurological Surgery and is the Michael J. Marchese Professor. However, they think beyond Northwestern's walls to improve care for patients throughout the world. They are well aware that exemplary professionals made their departments among the top in the nation, well before they arrived at Northwestern. Both men say they want to give their people optimal conditions and support to move forward in research, student/resident education and patient care. Increasing collabora- tion between disease specialists and surgeons to find new therapies is one of the key initiatives they started at the Feinberg School of Medicine. \"We will expand our portfolio for research and patient care,\" Dr. Krainc insists. \"We will also focus on incurable diseases that have proven especially challenging from the standpoint of drug develop-ment. We owe this to our patients and their families.\" 18 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 19AN INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK It would seem that Krainc was at the top of his game after 21 years at Harvard Medical School, where he achieved international prominence in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. A native of Slovenia, he completed his research and clinical training, including residency and fellowship, at Massachusetts General and Brigham and Women's hospitals. As a Harvard faculty member, he continued as a practicing neurologist at Massachusetts General, where he was named a 2013 Research Scholar and given five years of unrestricted funding to pursue projects that may lead to unexpected discoveries. He loved Boston and the smart people there who pushed him to his full potential as a physician-scientist; however, North- western presented an option to lead one of the nation's top neurology departments and collaborate with experts throughout the University. (Even before he officially started at Northwestern, Dr. Krainc began partnering with faculty from the Robert R. McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and Richard Silverman, PhD, from the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, who developed the chemical marketed as the drug Lyrica.) Since traditional drug development in neurology has stalled, Krainc says the opportunity to work with experts in nanotechnology, medicinal chemistry, and biomedical engineering was extremely important to him in order to use novel technologies to discover therapies for devastating diseases such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, ALS, and Alzheimer's. \"Northwestern Medicine is one of the few places in the country that has an upward trajectory in these challenging times for healthcare,\" Krainc says. \"That was very appealing to me. It is a combina- tion of visionary leadership and a good business model, along with recent changes that enable the seamless integration of clinical care with biomedical research.\" Dr. Krainc maintains strong European connections, supported by his global research partnerships and multi-lingual background. As part of education programs at Harvard Medical International, he participated in the development of medical education curricula and faculty training programs around the world.He says the experience taught him to \"listen first to understand their approach and their culture, then try to help\"a credo he operates by to this day. \"As a father of two wonderful teenage daughters, Talia and Maya, I have learned once again that listening is preferred to unsolicited advice,\" he adds. HIT THE GROUND RUNNING In his laboratory, Krainc investigates neurodegenerative diseases and is distressed by pharmaceutical companies downsizing or eliminating neuroscience programs because they are difficult business models. Meanwhile, the number of people with Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, is ex-pected to dramatically increase in the next decade, creating a major problem to care for these patients. \"You have some pharmaceutical compa- nies bailing out, but patients are not bailing out. They want treatments now more than ever,\" he says. \"As part of an academic medical center, I feel that we should step up and take the lead, increasing our efforts to find cures for these terrible diseases. We should also advocate for more collabora- tions between academic centers, NIH and industry to mobilize all available resources.\" As part of this vision, Krainc will establish a Center for Rare Neurological Diseases, bringing together scientists and physicians to find targeted therapies by exploring links between rare and common disorders. He and others have observed that children who suffer from rare genetic disorders exhibit brain tissue pathologies resembling those found in common neurodegenerative diseases. Studying these similarities is essential for drug development. If investigations are success- ful, efforts could lead to treatments for rare conditions like neuronopathic Gaucher's disease, an often fatal children's disorder caused by an enzyme deficiency, and common diseases such as Parkinson's, in which the loss of dopamine cells in the brain affects the adult nervous system. Specifically, Krainc is studying brain pathology in children afflicted with rare genetic forms of diseases involving lysosomes, the \"recycling centers\" that rid cells of toxins and debris. When lysosomes weaken due to enzyme deficiency, nerve cells are unable to recycle correctly and brain function diminishes. A substantial portion of his research focuses on pinpoint- ing methods to reactivate the enzyme, which could result in the first targeted therapy for these disorders, both in children and adults. \"This approach is different because we are focusing on the molecular targets that have already been validated in patients with rare and common disorders,\" he explains. \"Using specific drugs, we are trying to activate these targets and measure molecular activity to see what works. This strategy will hopefully lead to less expensive clinical trials because we will quickly determine which drugs are effective.\" Collaborating with teams of fellow neurologists and neurosurgeons, Krainc, with assistance from Parsa, has already enhanced care and laid the groundwork to improve treatment for stroke patients. Physicians from seven Chicago-area hospitals recently formed the Chicago Stroke Trials Consortium, with Northwest- ern Medicine as the regional coordinating center under the supervision of Shyam Prabhakaran, MD, associate professor of neurology. Supported by a $2 million NIH grant, the consortium facilitates participa- tion in national clinical trials for stroke prevention, treatment and recovery and fosters home-grown trials. In one initiative, PI Andrew Naidech, MD, MSPH, associate professor and medical director of the ICU, and his team proposes a clinical trial this spring for the drug desmopressin to control acute intracranial hemorrhage, an ex- tremely debilitating stroke caused by a blood vessel rupture in the skull. No FDA-approved therapy exists to treat it. INNOVATIVE TEACHING At Northwestern, Krainc is a mentor on several fronts, including grantsmanship strategies, and back-to-basics education and patient care. A scientist with diversified public and private funding, he encourages faculty to develop projects that also appeal to private investors.FEATURE: NO PATIENT LEFT BEHIND DRS.

Philanthropists are very sophisticated and they do not appreciate approaches that have not worked in the past. They want novel solutions for patients at all levels, from basic science to clinical care,\" he says. For some, technology defines progress, but Krainc is exasperated by too much opportunity to grow a department that was already clinically excellent. When I looked at metrics such as patient volumes, growth capacity, research infrastructure and admin- istrative support, there really was no place like Northwestern,\" he says. When it comes to top U.S. training programs and busy medical centers, Parsa has seen plenty. He earned his bachelor's degree at Yale College in molecular biophysics and biochemistry. He returned to his birthplace, Brooklyn, for his medical degree and doctorate in immunology and cell biology from SUNY Downstate Medical Center, working at Kings County Hospital Center, one of the nation's largest county hospitals. During his residency at Columbia University, he met his wife, Charlotte Shum, MD, who was appointed associate professor of orthopaedic surgery at Feinberg last fall. She was a hand and upper extremity specialist for more than a decade at Permanente Medical Group in Oakland, Calif. Building on his ideas from UCSF and empowering Feinberg specialists to move forward, Parsa is intensifying collaboration between surgeons and neurologists to enhance care. For instance, he supported expansion of the Telestroke program to remote Chicago- area hospitals outside the NMH network. (The network includes Chicago and Lake Forest hospitals and a free-standing emergency room in Grayslake.) Telestroke rapidly connects these institutions with NMH neurologists and neurosurgeons via the Internet for time-critical stroke assessment and treatment guidance, which are essential to prevent patients from becoming disabled. If needed, patients can be transferred to an NMH hospital. Richard Bernstein, MD, PhD, professor of neurology and director of the Stroke and Telestroke program, implemented the program last fall at Norwegian American Hospital on Chicago's West Side and at Northwest Community Hospital in suburban Arlington Heights this spring. Other locations are being considered. In another neurology-neurosurgery initiative, Dr. Parsa is working to increase use of stereotactic electroencephalography (EEG) procedures to pinpoint causes and locations of brain seizures. Stereotactic EEG is a potentially less-invasive and more precise method than traditional approaches to assess patients with epilepsy. SWEATING THE SMALL STUFF Since 2002, Parsa's laboratory has focused on understanding how the immune system can be used to fight brain cancer. He is study chair for the largest randomized brain tumor vaccine trial ever funded by the National Cancer Institute. Coordinators plan to enroll more than 200 patients with recurrent glioblastoma that can be surgi- cally removed. A vaccine made from the patient's tumor is administered to induce an immune response that kills remaining tumor cells and extends survival. The Phase II data supporting clinical trial was recently published in the journal Neuro-Oncology. Parsa plans to meet with the FDA in early 2014 to discuss the ongoing trials and submission requirements for drug approval. \"It has been 10 years since I started this, and my goal has always been to take it as far as I could,\" he explains. \"Moving something from the experimental phase to a standard of care is a complicated process that requires multiple teams of devoted scientists and clinicians.

He wants to refocus students on adept examination and diagnostic skills, and strong doctor-patient bonds. \"Students and residents tend to rely too much on technology and have less and less time to talk with patients!\" he says. \"I want to promote fundamental knowledge that brings doctors back to the patient's bedside.\" INDEFATIGABLE SURGEON-SCIENTIST Dr. Parsa's management style is highly personal: he prefers face-to-face meetings rather than emails, and constantly acknowl- edges the good efforts of colleagues and staff. He prides himself on knowing the names of everyone he works with\u2014from the security guards in his office building to the entire OR staff. He gives his cell phone number to patients so they can reach him if conventional channels fail. He's at North- western Memorial Hospital (NMH) seven days a week and even takes his daughters Julia and Micheline, 9, and son, Ismail, 6, on rounds to meet his patients and staff because he believes everyone benefits. Prior to joining Northwestern, Parsa was professor and vice chair in the department of neurological surgery at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). \"Coming here was an outstanding AS CHAIR, DR. KRAINC DIVIDES HIS TIME BETWEEN THE CLINICAL AND RESEARCH ENVIRONMENTS. HERE HE CHECKS IN WITH RESEARCH FELLOW LENA BURBULLA IN THE LAB. 22 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 23this drug, which has shown promising results to date.\" His outlook that no patient should be forgotten drives him to seek better treatments for rare types of brain tumors, particularly understudied skull base tumors. Usually benign, these tumors located behind the eyes, nose and ears press on nerves and blood vessels, destroying body functions. Accessing and surgically resecting them can be challeng- ing. Parsa is pursuing an adaptive hybrid approach combining radiation with resec- tion to minimize disease and maximize tumor control. \"I see many patients from all over the world with skull base tumors, and I think there is a great opportunity to develop a better understanding about the different pathophysiologies, the best treatments, and the best management paradigms. It is important not to treat all tumors with one approach of only radiation or only aggres- sive surgical resection; the complications of the latter can be devastating,\" he says. In spring 2014, Parsa will be a lead PI in a multi-center trial for adaptive hybrid surgery using software that helps surgeons determine how much tumor they have removed and identify optimal radiation targets for what remains. AN IMPERFECT LEADER Parsa has one candid message to his trainees and neurosurgical colleagues: \"I have made plenty of mistakes.\" He believes one of the most important things a chair can do is to share his or her errors so others don't repeat them. Among his prime lessons: Don't take on too much, too soon before infrastructure is set up. \"Otherwise, what happens is that you do everything in an average way but not as well as you would like to. With so many great things going on at Northwest- ern, it is tempting to take on too much.\" His frank communication style earned him many teaching awards at UCSF. He was twice awarded the Harold Rosegay Resident Teaching Award in the depart- ment of neurological surgery. In 2010, he was named Mentor of the Year for the medical school. He continues to take pride in mentoring, and speaks weekly with former residents and students. However, he is not dogmatic about what his trainees should do in neurosur- gery. As someone who performs about 300 surgeries annually while conducting research and clinical trials, he does not try to mold students and residents in his image. He seeks to understand what motivates them about neurosurgery and steers them to that interest. \"My philosophy for my residents is basically this: Tell me where you want to be in 10 years and we'll get you there in a way that makes us very proud of what you do.\" STAYING ON TOP Drs. Krainc and Parsa are quick to say that neurological diseases cannot be solved unless neurologists and neurosurgeons work well together. And the chairs are resolute about maintaining Northwestern Medicine's position among the nation's top neurology and neurosurgery programs. \"If I have one clear message, it is that I am very patient-oriented and that's what gets me up every morning,\" Krainc says. \"I want the best delivery of care, I want top-notch research. We should have a sense of innovation and collaboration. If we do all of these things, we have fulfilled our promise to the people we care for.\" As an in-demand surgeon who leads a high-powered department, a father of three young children, and a scientist, Parsa continues full-speed ahead with an unwavering focus. \"I don't see much separation between my work and my family. My work is one continuous stream of people I care about,\" he says. \"I have been going this way since I was a resident in 1996. I don't know any other way to do it than to be fully involved on both sides.\" FEATURE: NO PATIENT LEFT BEHIND WORK AND FAMILY LIFE INTERTWINE IN DR. PARSA'S WORLD.

WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS: PROGRESS NOTES 34 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 35When the recession was in full swing, Shirley Chi, MD '01, GME '02, was giving talks in the Los Angeles community about how to save money on skincare products at the drugstore. Word got out to one of the evening news anchors and the medical producer at a local ABC News affiliate. They thought saving money on skin care was something of interest to their audience. When they first called, Chi thought there had to be a mistake.\"After all, I was just a clinical dermatologist focused on patient care,\" she says \"My office was in Arcadia, a family-friendly community far from the glamour and cach\u00e9 of Beverly Hills or Newport Beach. But, they assured me that I was the one they were looking for.\" Her first story, finding inexpensive yet effective over-the-coun- ter acne treatments, ran in 2009. Walking down the aisles at her local drugstore, Dr. Chi talked about what ingredients to look for and what to avoid in skin and hair care products, ranging from acne treatments to shampoo to anti-aging regimens. \"It felt strange to be followed around by a camera crew with a microphone clipped to my clothes and discussing patient concerns with a reporter whom I had only seen before on television,\" Chi explains. \"Afterward I went back to work like any other clinic day, not knowing that the story would garner such a positive response from their viewers, that we would tape more segments, and even do a 30-minute special down the road.\" Since then, this board-certified dermatologist and dermatologic surgeon has become an on-air advocate for patients, doing stories on topics ranging from sunscreen protection and bug bites to skin diseases. \"The experience is like a patient visit, but with millions of people at a time,\" she says. \"It is a gift to be able to get a message out to people who may not be able to afford a dermatologist or may not know they need to see one.\" Chi also has the opportunity to share information about available therapies, including a recent segment about the pros and cons of a relatively new laser treatment for psoriasis. \"What I really love about ABC7 is their commitment to 'tell it, not sell it.' In other words, although they receive a lot of pitches to do stories promoting new skincare products, lasers, or treatments, if I don't feel that the science behind it is sound or evidence-based, I will advise them not to pursue it,\" she admits. BALANCING ACADEMICS AND PRIVATE PRACTICE Dr. Chi believes this opportunity to impact such a large number of individuals would not have presented itself if she hadn't attended the Feinberg School of Medicine. After graduating from the Honors Program in Medical Education (HPME) she com- pleted a residency in dermatology at the McGaw Medical Center of Northwestern University and at Chicago's Cook County Hospital, serving as chief resident during her final year. \"I had the right background \u2014 Feinberg taught me not just how to be a physician, but also how to be a good communicator,\" she explains. During one of her favorite medical school courses, Patient, Physician and Society, she learned communication skills and ethical reasoning, as well as proper attitude and conduct in the physician- patient relationship. The faculty member leading the course, former chair of neurological surgery Leonard Cerullo, MD, also served as her mentor. Chi remembers admiring Dr. Cerullo's ability to balance teaching with his other responsibilities and says that's something she strives for in her life. \"I have been able to maintain that balance of academics and private practice that was modeled by my teachers at Northwestern,\" she says. \"Now that I have a beautiful one-year old son, life balance becomes even more important. I feel truly blessed to be able to maintain a busy clinic along with all my family responsibilities.\" Chi notes fourth-year rotations as another highlight of medical school. One particularly memorable experience oc-curred when the internal medicine team was baffled by a patient with a mysterious rash and requested a dermatology consult. She witnessed a dermatologist give a diagnosis without expensive lab tests or heavy equipment. \"The dermatology team strode in like a scene from a Western film,\" she recalls \"They examined the patient and made the diagnosis of Reiter Syndrome (a form of arthritis that can cause inflammation and pain in the joints, skin, eyes, bladder, genitals and mucus membranes) right on the spot. I was so taken by their ability to recognize a disease and diagnose an internal condition by looking at the skin that I quickly made up my mind that this was the specialty for me.\"MENTORING RESIDENTS Dr. Chi maintains a private practice in Arcadia, Calif., and teaches as a volunteer faculty member at the University of California, Los Angeles. \"I always tell my students that they make me smarter,\" she admits. \"They are always studying and reading journals on the latest research. Just by being around them, I learn and stay on top of new information in my field.\" She also serves as the director of dermatology-resident education at Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. For her dedica- tion to teaching future doctors, Dr. Chi received the President of the United States Volunteer Service Award in 2007. \"I realized with each class and with each rotation at Northwestern that my teachers were all leaders at the forefront of their respective fields,\" she says. \"That sort of environment encouraged me to do my best and to try to become a leader in my profession and in my community, not just through teaching young dermatologists, but by being an outspoken advocate for my patients, as well.\"WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS: ALUMNI PROFILE It is a gift to be able to get a message out to people who may not be able to afford a dermatologist or may not know they need to see one.Dr. Chi has also been an advocate for Northwestern, beginning to support the medical school's scholarship program after completing her residency training. \"In the past I've often directed my contribution to the scholarship fund, in the hopes that we can continue to educate the best and brightest future physicians, regardless of their economic background,\" she says. WRITTEN BY: Sarah Plumridge 36 NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MAGAZINE WINTER 2013-14 37What goes around, comes around. When Roger E. Sheldon, MD '68, was applying for medical school, one of the staff who interviewed him at Northwestern University Medical School was Merrel D. Flair, EdD, then assistant dean and director of admissions. \"Dr. Flair helped select me as a recipient of a full-tuition scholarship,\" Dr. Sheldon recalls. The administrator also recruited the young man to lead the bass section of the Flair family's church choir in Oak Park, for $10 a week. Now, nearly 40 years later, Dr. Sheldon and his wife, Carol V. Sheldon, MD, have provided an endowment of $100,000 to the Feinberg School of Medicine for the McNicol Flair Sheldon Scholar- ship, in honor of his maternal uncle, Gordon McNicol, MD '34, who also received scholarships to attend medical school, but died a year after graduation from complications of an ear infection; and Dr. Flair, who also died relatively young. Both men greatly influenced his path, each in their own way. Even though he never met his uncle, Dr. Sheldon considered Dr. McNicol a role model who \"set an example of a possible career path that I might follow.\" Similarly, Dr. Flair \"was enthusiastic about my admission to Northwestern and eased my way by sincere friendship. While a freshman, I had dinner with his family on several occasions.\" SAVING BABIES During his lengthy career, Dr. Sheldon practiced newborn intensive care or neonatology. The pediatric folks at Northwestern got me interested in pediatrics and the newborn folks at Boston Children's Hospital (where he completed a three-year residency in pediatrics) got me interested in newborns,\" he says. \"I was particularly drawn to the field of neonatology because acute care could make such a vast difference in an infant's life.\" He points out that \"approximately 15 to 20 percent of the children who end up in the ICU will die, but nearly 100 percent would die if they were not treated in an ICU. \"Neonatology is a life-saving specialty. It is also a lot of fun, plus there has been a huge increment in growth and knowledge,\" he notes. \"It wasn't really a specialty in the early 1960s. I was fortunate to get in on the ground floor.\" After his residency, Dr. Sheldon spent two years in the Army as a pediatrician at William Beaumont General Hospital at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. That was followed by a one-year fellowship in pediatric lung disease and a two-year fellowship in newborn intensive care, both at the University of Colorado in Denver. Sheldon and his family moved to Oklahoma City in the summer of 1979, at which point he became a section chief for newborn intensive care at the University of Oklahoma, where he remained for 31 years until retiring in 2010. IMPROVING CARE Looking back, Dr. Sheldon is proud of the training he provided to expand the duties of neonatal nurse practitioners, both in Denver and Oklahoma City, due to a shortage of interns and residents. These nurses learned how to do tracheal intubations and insert umbilical catheters and chest tubes. He describes many of these procedures in a book he co-authored in 1983 entitled, \"The Expanding Role of the Nurse in Neonatal Intensive Care.\" Through the years, the father of two also devoted a considerable amount of time to developing fast, efficient newborn transport, \"a crucial part of care. These children are born all over the place and you need to move them to the various newborn ICUs in the region.\" Nurses would stabilize the patient for transport by heli- copter or ambulance to the nurseries. \"We prefer to move the mother, but sometimes you have to move the baby instead,\" Dr. Sheldon says. Besides attaining a full professorship in pediatrics, with an emphasis in fetal physiology and newborn intensive care, Dr. Sheldon served for more than 20 years as assistant dean of continuing medical education at the University of Oklahoma. He was also closely involved in teaching doctors and nurses at smaller hospitals around Oklahoma about newborn issues, including stabilization and transport. \"I always followed the rule: Don't short-change the clinical care. That's what keeps your juices flowing,\" he asserts. Dr. Sheldon and his wife Carol were married during his sophomore year at Northwestern and this year they celebrate 48 years together. The couple now lives in Golden Valley, Minn., and has six grandchildren. Carol earned her medical degree from the University of Colorado in 1979 and became a resident in radiology at the Uni- versity of Oklahoma. \"Carol put me through most of medical school in Chicago by doing computer programming, and I put her through school in Colorado,\" he explains. By creating the McNicol Flair Sheldon Scholarship, \"Carol and I hope, in some small way, to repay the scholarship support that was given to us,\" Dr. Sheldon says.WARD ROUNDS\u00ae NEWS: ALUMNI PROFILE MERREL D.
