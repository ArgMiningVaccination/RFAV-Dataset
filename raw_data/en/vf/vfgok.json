This gentle procedure helps to remove toxins in the colon, which, in turn, helps the entire body to detoxify. A soothing flow of purified warm water is gently instilled into the colon via a disposable rectal nozzle (size of a pencil) gently stimulating the colon's natural peristaltic action in order to release softened waste.

Colon Hydrotherapy is NOT a cure for any disease, ailment, or health condition. No medical claims are expressed or implied, either directly or indirectly. Alternative Prep for Colonoscopy: The Soma Detoxx Spa is the only colonic center in northern Vermont to offer FDA-REGISTERED ANGEL OF WATER colonics. This system is a safe, comfortable, and hygienic way to irrigate the colon for a variety of medical purposes including endoscopies, colonoscopies, or other medical procedures. USING COLON HYDROTHERAPY FOR COLONOSCOPY PREP Sometimes people avoid having a colon cancer screening because they fear the cleansing preparation more than the colonoscopy itself. Prior to the procedure the colon needs to be cleansed of waste in order for the doctor to get a clear view of your colon. There are typically two ways of performing this cleanse: Chemical laxatives or Colon Hydrotherapy. Unfortunately, many people report that the chemical laxative pre-cleanse is very unpleasant and sometimes painful. It can be highly inconvenient as it often requires keeping very close to a bathroom for as long as a full day, taking time away from work. Colon Hydrotherapy offers a drug-free alternative by using warm, purified water to flush the colon of waste. This allows for little to no cramping, and allows you to go about your normal activities afterwards. In addition to cleansing, colon hydrotherapy promotes peristalsis, which enhances the muscle tone of the colon and supports elimination. We suggest the following schedule when using Colon Hydrotherapy as an alternative prep for Colonoscopy: One week prior to exam: Contraindications: You should not pursue colon hydrotherapy treatment if you have any of the following conditions: | | How to Prepare: On the day of your session, eat lightly, and you can eat up to two hours before your session. You may eat anytime following your session. You may print out the client intake form to bring with you on the first appointment. Scheduling Your Colonic Session People decide to have colonics for many different reasons which is why there are many ways to set up sessions to meet your individual needs. For cases of severe constipation, we recommend that clients begin by doing \"back-to-back\" sessions. After the second session, most clients have a sense of whether they want to continue having more sessions or not. Doing \"back-to-back\" sessions While this is not a mandatory way to schedule, it is recommended by The International Association of Colon Hydrotherapy (I-ACT) for many reasons: 1. It allows you to have a more thorough cleanse (you soften up fecal matter on day one that sometimes doesn't come out until day #2, especially if you struggle with constipation). 2. While most clients report feelings of increased energy and well-being following their sessions, a small percentage of clients leave after their first session with minor common detoxification side effects such as having a headache or feeling tired. Most clients report feeling great post the second session. Ways to schedule if you are on a specific cleanse If you are planning to go on a cleanse or fast, doing back-to back colonics is not necessary although the more colonics you have during a cleanse, the better clients report feeling. We recommend having at least one colonic per week while on a cleansing protocol. Clients who suffer from constipation.report feeling best on a cleansing diet when they schedule their colon hydrotherapy session on the first or second day of their program. If you are working with a doctor and are doing a heavy metal cleanse, please follow your doctor's recommendation about when is the best time for you! Clients who are doing Interested in deepening your cleansing experience? You do not have to be on a cleanse or fast to benefit from colon hydrotherapy; however, if you are interested in deepening your cleansing experience before coming in for a session, there are many ways to do so, such as: 1. Increase your water consumption to be half of your body weight in ounces. For example, if you weigh 120 lbs., your goal would be to drink 60 ounces of water per day. 2. Aim for sleeping 8 hours a night without interruption. 3. Include more fresh vegetables and fruit in your diet, especially leafy greens such as salad greens, kale, spinach and swiss chard. 4. Consider eliminating foods to which you suspect you are allergic or sensitive. 5. Cut down or eliminate processed food, fast food, and junk food from your diet. 6. Reduce/eliminate sugar consumption. Post-Session: Treatments which will complement your cleansing experience: \"It can be strongly said that the health of an individual is largely determined by the ability of the body to detoxify.\" ~ Dr. Joseph Pizzorno, ND The connection between toxins and disease is now undisputed by the natural medicine world, while being mostly ignored by the allopathic medical community. Our bodies have the capacity to heal if given what they need; our cells need nutrition and detoxification on a daily basis to stay strong and vital. These have always been the foundational concepts in naturopathic medicine. "}
