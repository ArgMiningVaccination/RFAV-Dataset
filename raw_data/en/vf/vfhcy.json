Anonymous YogiPosted 4 years ago on BookRetreats I actually stayed in a neighboring hotel and walked to this retreat each morning. It was not only fantastic, but life-changing. I've only done a few yoga classes in my life and I'm 62. I was a bit scared but I'm so glad I took the plunge. JUST DO IT! The verbal and musical journey called \"cocooning\" was surreal. My first ever spiritual journey. If you are sitting on the fence about this type of experience, you won't be disappointed. Donny and Heather have one foot in the \"real world\" which made all the difference in the \"this\" world to me. I was in Kauai with my family and thought why not attend a retreat while I'm over here? I live on the east coast of the mainland. I was nervous but now I'm so glad I made myself go way outside of my personal comfort zone. I think life truly begins here. Anonymous YogiPosted 4 years ago on BookRetreats This was the worst decision I made. Prior to going to Hawaii, I was asked to pay my fees one month in advance because space was limited. When I arrived there was one person there that was just leaving. This was not a group event. The location does not look like it is in the pictures, there is no waterfall. There was no water in the Buda fountain and the sauna was not working. The room I got was really small no doors, it was the size of a canopy. One bathroom had no doors and the place is a house on a rented on a property with 2 houses. I did not feel safe because of how the location looked run down. There was no drinking water, they had to go buy some. I did not stay because Heather did not look like the person in the picture. She looked like she just woke up and for me, if I am paying $250 a day, I think I deserve to be greeted in a professional manner. I felt mislead to believe this was a group event, and it was a professional business retreat location. I ended staying in Hawaii and do other things instead. There needs to more clarity of where exactly this retreat is located and what to expect but it not worth $250 a day that is for sure. I thought it was a group event and I would be part of the experience with others. Not by my self. \"Dear Tiger, We realize that you had a very challenging day before arriving to us with issues with your car rental, etc. We are very surprised to hear that you did not notice the sliding glass door with a lock in your room, as well as the doors on all of the rooms and in the bathrooms. We are sure that arriving so stressed could have caused such oversight. As you also only stayed for maybe 20 minutes or so, as you were feeling so out of sorts being in the lush tropical side of the island where few tourists have the opportunity to stay, we totally understand that being from California you wanted to be in a more busy part of the island and felt rather confused and disoriented. We make every effort to explain that we are located on the lush tropical side of the island and are somewhat rustic, and if you are needing the creature comforts of modern hotels and touristy areas, then we are not for you. We also understand that as you were feeling out of your comfort zone, you didn't notice all of the doors, plus the screens on our accommodations and bathrooms, and our Quan Yin Fountain, and hot tub which were working. We do survey our guests and ask them if our offerings match their expectations and have received an overwhelming \"yes.\" We are imaging that you actually expected that the waterfalls and all of the beautiful Maui scenery that we have highlighted were actually all on our property. While this particular waterfall is just less than 1 mile away, our intention is to feature the natural beauty that can be experienced here on the island for our guests. We would hope that our guests would understand that we don't have all of these incredible natural features on our property, but that they are all easily accessible. We are always striving to make our offerings as clear as possible by posting photos, including those of our accommodations, and are here to clarify and answer any questions. In addition, we were totally sold out during your stay. We think that you may have been confused and thought that everyone was going to arrive at the same time that you did. We find that our guests really appreciate the flexible nature of our offering in that they can arrive when they like and stay for as long as they like. This means, that like you, they might be the only person arriving that particular day, and some may leave, and others may arrive, but like we shared with you, we still had a full house! In addition, as we are a boutique center, and have a limited number of people that we can host, we do require 30 days in advance secure booking, as we do frequently sell out. We are happy to hear that you did make other arrangements in the more touristy area that better suit your needs. We wish you all the best! \" Heather, Black Swan Temple Anonymous YogiPosted 5 years ago on BookRetreats I have been through many life changes these last few years and really need a break. It was my first real vacation by myself and this was the perfect setup for that. I chose this retreat because I wanted to go to Hawaii and this option was within my budget and offered other healing sessions besides yoga and meditation. I also liked the challenge of learning something new, which in this case was aerial yoga. I was able to truly disconnect from all the external and internal mental chatter I have been experiencing in my life. I felt so many changes start to take place through detoxing, eating healthy, hanging in the amazing aerial swings, and basking in the beauty of Maui. Heather and Donny are such a dynamic duo! I appreciated their light heartedness and laid back manner in accomodating for their guests. Being a small retreat center, I received a lot of attention in my aerial practice and really loved being able to laugh, share and ask questions with the small group during the classes. I also enjoyed the mealtimes to share with the group and hear everyone's life stories and shared experiences. Because the retreat activities were in the morning, I loved having the afternoon and evening free to go out and explore Maui. I was blown away by everything there was to see and do on the island and wish I could have had more time. Overall, the experience was absolutely lovely and nourishing to my body, heart, mind and soul. Anonymous YogiPosted 4 years ago on BookRetreats I have been working nonstop and most vacations I take are family related, so I needed some solo time to fill my cup. This retreat was a great price for all that I got! I was amazed at all that was included! I felt very taken care of and attended to by the hosts as well as feeling freedom to be on my own and explore. I really benefited from the yoga and sound healing--it provided space for me to work through difficult emotions and clear my inner vessel. I was so well taken care of. The meals provided were incredible, the host and hostess so warm and inviting, and the experience in yoga and personal sessions provided respite and grounding for my mind, body, and soul. I loved the accommodations in which I had a darling personal bungalow. The hosts provided guidance on what and where to explore on the island and I had a blast!
