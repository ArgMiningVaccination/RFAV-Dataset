About Acupuncture Part of an ancient practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), acupuncture is effective in alleviating a variety of health conditions and symptoms. The foundation of this practice is to balance energy that flows through meridians across the body. Acupuncture involves strategically inserting very fine, metal needles into the skin at specific points (acupoints) along these pathways. The needles are used to rebalance the body's qi- or flow of energy - and yield a natural healing response. What to Expect During Your Session Acupuncture treatment takes place in a quiet, private treatment room. The needles used in this practice are sterile, disposable, and only about as thin as a strand of human hair. Patients typically feel very little (if any) discomfort during the initial insertion and removal. Some patients describe the feeling as being similar to a pinprick, but less painful than a vaccination. A treatment session may involve placing anywhere from five to 20 needles into the skin, depending on the specific needs of the patient. Needles are inserted at depths of up to a couple of inches or less and remain inserted for varying amounts of time during each session. The needles may be gently moved or rotated at certain points during treatment to facilitate a response. Patients may be advised to let the practitioner know if they feel specific sensations that may signal the treatment is working as it should.
