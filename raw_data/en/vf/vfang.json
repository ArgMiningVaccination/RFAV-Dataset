Why We No Longer Recommend Grain-Free Dog Foods Since 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has been investigating reports of a possible link between grain-free diets (high in peas, lentils, other legume seeds and/or potatoes in various forms) and a canine heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). As of December 2022, [the FDA announced](https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/outbreaks-and-advisories/fda-investigation-potential-link-between-certain-diets-and-canine-dilated-cardiomyopathy) that enough data does not yet exist to confirm a causa link, but that they would continue to monitor scientific research on the subject by academics, veterinarians and those in the pet food industry. What to Look for in Natural Dog Food What \"Natural\" Means The term \"natural\" on dog food labels simply means that the ingredients in the food are \"derived solely from plant, animal or mined sources, either in its unprocessed state or having been subject to physical processing,\" according to the [Association of American Feed Control Officials](https://talkspetfood.aafco.org/natural). Natural dog foods are not necessarily organic (if they are, it will be stated on the label). Before purchasing, always make sure there is a statement from the [Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO)](https://petfood.aafco.org/labeling-labeling-requirements) on the food's container, says Dr. Richardson. \"[That means the] food is formulated to be nutritionally complete for your pet and meets minimum standards,\" she says. Life Stage Choose a natural dog food formula that is intended for your dog's life stage. Foods labeled as \"maintenance\" are for adult dogs over 1 year of age. Foods labeled \"growth\" or \"growth and reproduction\" are for puppies under 1 year old and pregnant or nursing females. Foods labeled \"all life stages\" provide nutrition appropriate for any dog of any age, from puppy through adult. AAFCO Statement Choose a natural dog food that has a statement on the label that says the food is completed and balanced according to the nutritional levels established by the [Association of American Feed Officials](https://talkspetfood.aafco.org/readinglabels) (AAFCO) for that life stage. - Is natural dog food better for dogs? According to the [Association of American Feed Control Officials](https://talkspetfood.aafco.org/natural), the term \"natural\" simply means that the ingredient is \"derived solely from plant, animal or mined sources, either in its unprocessed state or having been subject to physical processing.\" Natural ingredients cannot be \"produced by or subject to a chemically synthetic process and not containing any additives or processing aids that are chemically synthetic.\" That said, natural dog foods are not automatically better than dog foods that are not labeled as natural. The most important indicator of healthy dog food is a statement on the label that says the food is complete and balanced for a particular life stage (maintenance for adults, growth for puppies, or all life stages, for any age dog). - Does natural dog food need to be refrigerated? Natural dog food comes in many different forms, including dry kibble, canned, freeze-dried, refrigerated, and fresh frozen. Dry kibble and freeze-dried food do not need to be refrigerated, even after opening the bag, though they should be stored in an airtight container. Canned food should be refrigerated after opening the can. Refrigerated food should be refrigerated before and after opening the package. Fresh frozen food should be thawed in the refrigerator, and leftovers should be refrigerated. - Is natural dog food grain free? Natural dog food is not the same thing as grain-free dog food. \"Natural\" simply means that the ingredients come from plant, animal, or mined sources without chemical processing. Some natural dog foods are also grain-free, which is clearly stated on the label, and some grain-free dog foods are not natural.
