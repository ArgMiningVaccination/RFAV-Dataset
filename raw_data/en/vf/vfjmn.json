Here, by investigating FPM's bioactivities in lung carcinoma mice models, we discover that these particles promote lung tumor progression by inducing aberrant thickening of tissue matrix and hampering migration of antitumor immunocytes. Upon inhalation into lung tissue, these adsorb peroxidasin (PXDN) - an enzyme mediating type IV collagen (Col IV) crosslinking - onto their surface. The adsorbed PXDN exerts abnormally high activity to crosslink Col IV via increasing the formation of sulfilimine bonds at the NC1 domain, leading to an overly dense matrix in the lung tissue. This disordered structure decreases the mobility of cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes into the lung and consequently impairs the local immune surveillance, enabling the flourishing of nascent tumor cells. Meanwhile, inhibiting the activity of PXDN abolishes the tumor-promoting effect of FPM, indicating the key impact of aberrant PXDN activity on the tumorigenic process. In summary, our finding elucidates a new mechanism for FPM-induced lung tumorigenesis and identifies PXDN as a potential target for treatment or prevention of the FPM-relevant biological risks. Editor's evaluation This article focused on the bioactivity of inhaled fine particulate matter (FPM) in promoting lung tumor progression. The authors presented carefully performed work with impressive quantity. They shed light on that FPM-accelerated tumorigenesis through disordering interstitial extracellular matrix in lung tissue and subsequently impairing early immune defense to tumor cells. Besides, they found that FPM's bioactivities are endowed by an unexpected enzyme, peroxidasin, related to the collagen crosslink, and the latter's abnormal high enzymatic activity. These findings are promising and provide a new potential target for preventing FPM-relevant diseases. [https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75345.sa0](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.75345.sa0) Introduction Inhalable fine particulate matter (FPM) with a diameter less than 1 m in air pollutants and tobacco smoke has been recognized as a group 1 carcinogen and substantial threat to global health ( [Lim et al., 2012](#bib42)). About 10 g/m3 increase in its concentration was correlated with an 8% rise in lung cancer mortality ( [Guan et al., 2016](#bib28)). However, its carcinogenic mechanism remains unclear. During lung tumorigenesis, both the growth of cancer cells per se and the supporting microenvironment are crucial ( [Martin et al., 2021](#bib43)). Earlier studies propose that the particles directly induce gene mutations and carcinogenesis ( [Wu et al., 2004](#bib71)). Clinical data suggests smoking as the factor for the highest prevalence of somatic mutation among lung cancers ( [Alexandrov et al., 2016](#bib3); [Alexandrov et al., 2013](#bib2)). However, despite its mutagenic potential, recent investigations reveal that FPM does not directly promote (and even inhibit) the proliferation of lung cancer cells. These inconsistent findings suggest that FPM might have unidentified targets other than cancer cells in promoting tumorigenesis, such as immune cells that play key roles in tumor development ( [Bissell and Hines, 2011](#bib12)). Under normal circumstances, the immune system rapidly detects and suppresses the tumor progression at the initial stage ( [Iwasaki et al., 2017](#bib34)). Especially, the - cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) - protect against potential cancer through efficient migration and cytotoxic contact with transformed or tumorigenic cells that have emerged in the lung interstitial space ( [DuPage et al., 2011](#bib20)). Once this crucial immunosurveillance and defense process of CTLs were compromised, the tumorigenesis would be uncontrollable ( [Joyce and Fearon, 2015](#bib36)). Under the chemotaxis of biochemical signals, the mobility of immunocytes depends on not only its intrinsic capacity but also the microstructure of the interstitial extracellular matrix (ECM), that is, the way paved for immune cells ( [Krummel et al., 2016](#bib38)). For the former, evidence about the direct effect of FPM on the immune cell's migration capacity was validated. It is estimated that tobacco smoke particulates (TSPs) could impair the migration function of macrophages to mycobacteria and lead to increased susceptibility to tuberculosis in smokers ( [Berg et al., 2016](#bib9)). For the latter, clinical evidence links a dense collagen matrix surrounding the tumor with the restriction of T cells' access ( [Salmon et al., 2012](#bib54); [Valkenburg et al., 2018](#bib63)). Based on these reports and analysis, we speculated that FPM could disturb the migration and distribution of T cells in lung tissue, thus impairing CLTs' immune defense capacity against cancerous cells and consequently promoting tumor progression. To test this hypothesis, we set out to study the effect of FPM inhalation on CTLs' immune response and tumor development by using both transplantation (Lewis lung carcinoma [LLC]) and transgenic (KrasG12DTrp53-/-) mouse models of lung carcinoma ( [Johnson et al., 2001](#bib35)). First, we validated that FPM promotes tumorigenesis by impairing CTLs' migration towards cancerous cells. The defect was attributed to denser collagen structure induced by FPM on CTLs' migration path, generating the physical isolation around tumor cells. More interestingly, we found that FPM exerts this effect by adsorbing peroxidasin (PXDN) enzyme specifically mediating collagen crosslinking at NC1 domain - and increasing this enzyme's activity to over-crosslink ECM and prevent CTLs migration, which eventually tolerates tumor progression. Results FPM promotes lung cancer development by hampering CTLs' migration To analyze the effect of FPM on lung tumorigenesis, first, we collected and prepared particulate matter in air pollutants with diameter <1 m (PM1) from seven locations in China and the tobacco smoke particle (TSP), respectively. Given that these particles displayed diverse morphology data 1](#fig1sdata1)), which is consistent with the material property of particles in other reports ( [Kelly and Fussell, 2012](#bib37)), we mixed PM1 with the equal proportion from each collection to eliminate the interference of sampling resources. Then, mice exposed to mixed PM1 (mixture) or TSP were analyzed on two cancer animal models: the syngeneic LLC inoculation model (LLC model) or the transgenic mouse model (KrasG12DTrp53-/-) as illustrated in [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement FPM markedly increased the tumors' multiplicity and progression. As KrasG12DTrp53-/- mice could generate multifocal tumors corresponding to different grades of lung carcinoma ( [Sayin et al., 2014](#bib55); [DuPage et al., 2009](#bib19)), the histological grade of this model was further analyzed. Tumors in FPM-exposed lung tissue were mainly classified as grade II and the ones of grade III and IV were significantly higher, whereas the majority of tumors in the phosphate buffer saline (PBS) group were of grade I, showing FPM leads to more advanced lung tumorigenesis ( [Figure 1B](#fig1)). Statistical analysis suggested that the number of tumors in the FPM-treated group was significantly higher than that in the PBS group (about three- to fivefold higher in LLC model and twofold higher in KrasG12DTrp53-/- model) ( [Figure 1C](#fig1)). Furthermore, the scenario was further validated by the corresponding tumor burden, based on the percentage of the area of tumor regions versus that of the total lung (about 7-fold more in LLC model and 10-fold more in KrasG12DTrp53-/- model). Moreover, in both models, PM1 and TSP exposure significantly shortened the survival of mice ( [Figure 1D](#fig1)). These results validated the correlation between FPM exposure and lung cancer development, in agreement with the epidemiological studies ( [Atkinson et al., 2014](#bib7)). [see all](/articles/75345/figures#fig1) Next, we explored the reason for FPM promoting tumorigenesis. The conditions of the seeds and soil - the uncontrollably proliferative cancer cells and a tolerable immune microenvironment - are both crucial for tumor development ( [Altorki et al., 2019](#bib4)). We analyzed the effect of FPM on the tumor cells and their congenial microenvironment, respectively. Interestingly, FPM hardly promoted the growth of tumor cells and even inhibited their proliferation at higher concentrations ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s3)). EdU incorporation assay was further employed to determine the impact of FPM exposure on tumor cells' proliferation in vivo. The result showed that the tumor site displayed similar replication capacity regardless of its size and advancement in these groups ( [Figure 1E](#fig1), [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 4](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s4)), casting the doubt on FPM's direct promotion of tumor growth. These results inspired us to assess the effect of FPM on the immune microenvironment. Among these immunocytes related to immune surveillance, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as the most ''informed'' defender are critical for locally extinguishing the nascent tumor. The efficacy of these cells determines the fate of transformed cells - to death or flourish. Thus, we examined the change of CTLs' response in different groups during tumor progression ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s5)). In the LLC model, CTLs in the PBS group were efficiently recruited into lung tissue to defend LLC stimulation, increasing up to about ninefold than that under the physiological condition at the initial stage (1-3 days). Conversely, the lung tissue with FPM exposure displayed blunt and insufficient early immune defense, with slight CTLs infiltration, decreasing by more than 60% relative to that of the PBS group, though there was no dramatic difference in CTLs accumulation among these groups at late stage (5-20 days). The immunofluorescence (IF) images also showed that FPM-exposed lung tissue was infiltrated with lower CTLs at the initial stage ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 6](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s6)). These results indicated that the CTL's early immune response might not be normal in FPM-exposed mice and be decisive for the lung tumorigenesis, which is consistent with the reports in transgenic autochthonous lung tumors ( [DuPage et al., 2011](#bib20)). Then, we detected the CTLs' infiltration in KrasG12DTrp53-/- model 4 weeks after tumor initiation, during which the immune response was reported to reach to the peak ( [DuPage et al., 2011](#bib20)). The results displayed similarly insufficient in group ( [Figure supplement 7](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s7)). To further determine whether CTLs' reaction was specific to tumor cells, we further evaluated CD8+ T cell activation in an OT-1 TCR transgenic mouse model, in which the CD8+ T cells express a T cell receptor recognizing the SIINFEKL peptide of ovalbumin (OVA) ( [Wang et al., 2020](#bib67)). Upon the stimulation of OVA-expressing LLC (OVA-LLC) cells, the flow cytometry analysis of activated CTLs in lung tissue showed consistent tendency ( [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 8](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s8)). OVA-LLC-specific immunity response in the antigen-specific-activated CTLs were significantly impaired by FPM exposure, decreasing to about 25% of that in the PBS group. Furthermore, to testify the indispensable role of CTLs on the tumor development, LLC cells were intravenously injected into FPM-exposed athymic Foxn1nu nude mice with T cell deficiency. As expected, the difference of lung tumorigenesis in PBS and FPM-exposed groups was and J](#fig1), supplement 9](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s9)), highlighting that the influences of FPM to tumor development were mediated by the CTLs. Additionally, without using tumor cells, we treated mice with a T cell chemokine - C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) - intrabronchially for 2 hr, as illustrated in [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10A](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s10), and found that the proportion of CTLs in FPM-treated mice (about 8%) significantly decreased compared with that of the PBS group (about 18%; [Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 10B](/articles/75345/figures#fig1s10)). This finding is consistent with the scenario observed in the tumor (LLC and KrasG12DTrp53-/-) model and strengthens the conclusion that FPM exposure delays the CTLs' instantaneous defense response. The above results, taken together, indicate that FPM accelerates lung tumorigenesis via impairing CTLs' infiltration into the lung tissue. FPM hinders CTLs' migration by crosslinking type IV collagen and thickening tissue matrix Next, we explored the reason for the impaired early response of CTLs under FPM exposure. CTLs' distribution in the lung interstitial tissue depends on its migration ability ( [Weninger et al., 2014](#bib70)), which is related to both the intrinsic activity of cells and the structure of the interstitial space formed by the local ECM on its migrating path ( [Mrass et al., 2010](#bib46)). We analyzed which factor was mainly affected by FPM. First, T cells treated with FPM in vitro or the CTLs separated from FPM-exposed lung tissue were respectively analyzed. Integrin-1 (ITGB-1), C-X-C al., 2015](#bib6)), the biomarkers related to CTLs' migration, were detected with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). These results showed that FPM stimulation had little effect on the migration potential of CTLs ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s1)). Second, we analyzed the change of the lung tissue structure after FPM exposure for 7 days. From scanning electron microscope (SEM images and quantitative analysis of the pore size of interstitial matrix) ( [Figure 2](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s2)), we noticed that the FPM exposure dramatically compressed the structure and crushed the interstitial space of the lung tissue. Further, Masson's trichrome staining indicated a higher density of collagen ( [Figure 2B](#fig2)). These data implied that FPM inhaled into the lung tissue condensed the native framework of ECM, which could block the path of CTLs migrating to the tumor site. [see all](/articles/75345/figures#fig2) Consequently, we investigated in greater detail the movement of CTLs in an ex vivo model. The migration of CTLs in the slice of lung tissue (native or FPM-exposed) was analyzed by dynamically visualizing the cells' movement ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s3)). to the from tissue exposed to FPM, CTLs struggled to migrate, while those of the PBS group displayed quick migration pattern. Statistical analysis further validated that compared with the PBS group the FPM-treated lung tissue severely hindered the migration of CTLs ( [Figure 2D](#fig2)), which were weakly motile and showed insufficient displacement, distance, and velocity ( [Bougherara et al., 2015](#bib14)). Therefore, the change in the interstitial space, rather than attenuated migrating potential of CTLs per se, is responsible for the weakened infiltration of these cells in the FPM-treated lung tissue. Then, we asked what caused the change of the lung structure after FPM exposure. Collagens, the main ECM components ( [Gaggar and Weathington, 2016](#bib25)), especially three kinds of ones enriched in lung tissue, including the type I, III, and IV ones (Col I, Col III, and Col IV) were focused on [Laurent, 1986](#bib39). First, ELISA was performed after different fragments of collagens were respectively harvested and divided into two categories by a reported protocol ( [Popov et al., 2011](#bib52)), that is, 'low-crosslinked' ones freshly secreted collagens, procollagens, and moderately crosslinked ones (high-cross) [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 4](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s4)). The results both PM1 and TSP exposure significantly elevated the high-crosslink proportion of Col IV, twofold higher than that in the PBS group, based on the separate examination of low-cross and high-cross ones ( [Figure 2E](#fig2)). Next, the relative quantification of high-crosslinked collagens compared with low-crosslinked ones based on Western blotting (WB) analysis showed consistent changes ( [Figure 2F](#fig2), [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s5)). Besides, the IF images indicated that FPM exposure induced Col IV in the lung tissue to generate enhanced crosslink and denser distribution, leading to the collagen network with more junction site and higher junction density ( [Figure 2G-J](#fig2), [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 6](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s6)). However, the other two types of collagens (Col I and Col III) showed no obvious change ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 7](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s7)), demonstrating an increased Col IV crosslinking accounted for the change in the lung ECM structure. Furthermore, based on the related integrated optical density (IOD) of Col IV in lung tissue slices and related CTLs' migration index (migration distance, displacement, and velocity) of different groups in [Figure 2D](#fig2), we performed the Pearson's correlation analysis and found an inverse relationship between Col IV density and CTLs' migration potential ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 8](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s8)). Furthermore, we pretreated the FPM-exposed lung tissue with collagenase D to reduce the Col IV crosslink and alleviate Col IV density ( [Figure 2K](#fig2)). The trajectory images and related quantification analysis showed that CTLs' migration was effectively recovered ( [Figure 2L and M](#fig2), [Figure 2\u2014videos 4-7](/articles/75345/figures#fig2video4)), further validating crucial role of Col IV crosslink on the CTLs' movement. These data together suggested that FPM exposure blocked CTLs migration and trapped these cells mainly through increasing Col IV crosslinking and consequently generating a denser ECM in the lung tissue, which might isolate the tumor cells from the CTLs' attack ( [Figure 2\u2014figure supplement 9](/articles/75345/figures#fig2s9)). FPM increases Col IV crosslinking through promoting sulfilimine bond formation We then investigated why FPM exposure led to increased Col IV crosslinking ( [Gaggar and Weathington, 2016](#bib25)). According to recent discovery, protein adsorbed onto the nanoparticles surface would endow them with new activities ( [Monopoli et al., 2012](#bib45); [Wang et al., 2017](#bib66)). As the median size of both PM1 and TSP is about 100-200 nm, it is possible that the collagen-crosslinking activity of FPM is derived from the proteins adsorbed onto their surface from lung tissue. To elucidate this, we separately incubated FPM in PBS or lung homogenate (LH) to simulate the scenario of FPM per se (FPM group) or the complex of FPM and its surface proteins (LH-FPM group, including LH-PM1 and LH-TSP). Then, according to an established experimental model with a slight modification ( [Bhave et al., 2012](#bib11)), soluble Col IV was generated by stimulating mouse bone marrow fibroblasts M2-10B4 cells, which highly express Col IV, with the inhibitor of collagen crosslink ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/75345/figures#fig3s1)). Next, the effect of FPM on the crosslink of soluble Col IV in the cellular system and acellular system was respectively analyzed as shown in [Figure 3A](#fig3). For the cellular system, Col IV immunostaining result of M2-10B4 cells showed FPM itself could not induce the crosslinking of soluble Col IV ( [Figure 3B](#fig3)). Relatively, the LH-FPM initiated the crosslinking and reinforced the network to a greater extent than that induced by LH per se, which could be validated by intensive crosslink intensity and a denser Col IV distribution, and collagen network with more junction site and higher junction density ( [Figure 3C-F](#fig3)). Meanwhile, for the acellular experiment, the cell lysate of M2-10B4-enriched soluble Col IV was incubated with FPM or LH-FPM mixture. WB result showed a similar scenario - the naked FPM had little devotion to Col IV crosslink, but the LH-FPM dramatically enhanced the high-crosslinked the question of how LH-FPM increased Col IV crosslinking. During crosslinking, the triple-helical protomer of Col IV, as the building block, forms network through two key types of crosslinking sites ( [Brown et al., 2017](#bib15)): NC1 2009](#bib64)) et al., 1980](#bib53); [Figure 3H](#fig3)). To distinguish which one is mainly disturbed by the FPM, we detected their changes under FPM stimulation respectively: (1) for the NC1 domain, sulfilimine bond (-S=N-) is formed by two juxtaposed Col IV protomers at residues methionine 93 indicated theoretical mass of crosslinked tryptic peptides containing -S=N in NC1 domain, we performed high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis to differentiate these peptides. For the NC1 domain separated from the crosslinked Col IV as illustrated in [Figure 3H](#fig3), we found significantly more sulfilimine-containing peptides in LH-FPM-treated soluble Col IV than that in the LH group according to the total ion chromatography (TIC) diagram ( [Figure 3I](#fig3)). (2) For the 7S domain crosslinking site, it was derived from the oxidation of one lysine residue in the N-terminal to the aldehyde ( [Anazco et al., 2016](#bib5)). The generated allysine would subsequently undergo a series of condensation reactions with other amino acids, mainly the other lysine or lysines on neighboring C-terminus, forming methylenimine ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4A](/articles/75345/figures#fig3s4)). During the process, the detection of primary product allysine could reflect the level of 7S domain crosslink. With the reported specific and efficient probes to allysine ( [Waghorn et al., 2017](#bib65)), the allysine yielded during the crosslinking of the soluble Col IV incubated with LH or LH-FPM was respectively analyzed. The result showed a slight difference, indicating the 7S domain would not be interfered by FPM ( [Figure 3\u2014figure supplement 4B](/articles/75345/figures#fig3s4)). Summarily, FPM gained a catalyzing activity from the proteins adsorbed from the tissue, which mediated the crosslinking by forming excessive -S=N- bonds among Col IV molecules. Phase transition of PXDN on FPM surface increases its activity for Col IV crosslinking Although the above findings demonstrated that LH-FPM increased sulfilimine bond formation to enhance Col IV crosslinking, it remained unclear how FPM gained the activity from LH to mediate this biochemical process in vivo. To elaborately dissect this process, following a standard procedure ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/75345/figures#fig4s1); [Carrillo-Carrion et al., 2017](#bib16)), we separated the biomacromolecules from LH-FPM, the majority of which are proteins and also known as 'protein corona' ( [Monopoli et al., 2012](#bib45)). Unexpected corona formation serious pathological reactions ( [Wang et al., 2017](#bib66); [Tenzer et al., 2013](#bib59)). Thus, we speculated whether FPM could recruit certain proteins related to Col IV crosslink into its corona, thereby enriching and empowering this protein - to influence the crosslinking of collagen IV. Given that the sulfilimine bond is uniquely catalyzed by PXDN enzyme ( [Bhave et 2012](#bib11); 2012](#bib69)), we focused and detected the PXDN in FPM's protein corona. The LC-MS result showed that PXDN was listed in the component profile of protein corona on both PM1 and TSP ( [Figure 4\u2014source data 1](#fig4sdata1)), reflecting FPM. We further analyzed PXDN adsorbed on FPM and its time evolution with WB ( [Wang et al., 2017](#bib66)). The data showed that PXDN not only adsorbed on the FPM ( [Figure 4A](#fig4)), but also stably the incubation time increased ( [Figure 4B](#fig4)), underlying that it might affect FPM's biological behavior durably. To further assess the adsorption of FPM to PXDN, we injected rhodamine fluorescence-labeled particles (R-FPM) via the trachea into the lung tissue and detected PXDN therein. The IF co-localization of FPM and PXDN in vivo was clearly presented, confirming the recruitment of this enzyme to FPM ( [Figure 4C](#fig4)), which could be further validated by the dramatically similar distribution of PXDN and FPM on M2-10B4 cells ( [Figure 4D](#fig4)). Taken these data indicate that FPM enriches and stabilizes PXDN in its surface corona. [see all](/articles/75345/figures#fig4) The adsorption of FPM might disturb the activity of proteins, especially for the enzyme therein. Thus, we examined the activity of FPM-recruited PXDN as illustrated in [Figure 4E](#fig4). Aimed at the substrate H2O2, the intermediates hypohalous acids, and the final NC1 domain with sulfilimine bond, different experimental analyses were respectively performed ( [Bhave et al., 2012](#bib11)). First, peroxidase activity of PXDN incubated with FPM was measured through Amplex Red molecular probes ( [Bathish et al., 2018](#bib8)). The relative fluorescence intensity showed that FPM incubation raised the enzymatic activity of PXDN up to 10-fold ( [Figure 4F](#fig4)). Next, PXDN's enzyme kinetic behaviors were investigated according to the Michaelis-Menten model. Based on the generated Line weaver-Burk representative plot, the Michaelis constant (Km) and turnover number (Kcat) were calculated, which respectively reflects the enzyme-substrate binding efficiency and the enzymatic efficiency. The result showed that PXDN incubated with FPM revealed significantly decreased Km (PM1: 7.36 M; TSP: 13.10 M vs. PBS: 15.92 M) and increased catalytic efficiency about 1.4- to 1.8-fold than the enzyme per se ( Also, al., 2012](#bib11); [McCall et and HOCl, generated by PXDN from bromide and chloride, were respectively analyzed. For HOBr, bromohydrin formed by the bromination of NADH was measured based on its close relation with HOBr production as reported in the literature ( [Bathish et al., 2018](#bib8); [Soudi et al., 2015](#bib58)). The LC-MS detection showed that the ratio of bromohydrin to NADH in the group of PXDN incubated with FPM was three- to fivefold higher than that of the enzyme per se group, indicating more HOBr production ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/75345/figures#fig4s2)). Besides, we measured HOCl in consideration of the vast excess of Cl- over Br- in most animals ( [Weiss et al., 1986](#bib68)), although uses Br- to formation of crosslinks with greater efficiency ( [McCall et al., 2014](#bib44)). detection of acid-detecting fluorescent probe ( [Xing et al., that HOCl produced by the FPM-incubated PXDN was about two- to fourfold higher than that of the PBS group ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/75345/figures#fig4s3)). Furthermore, to analyze the effect of FPM's adsorption on the catalytic product, after the commercial non-crosslinking NC1 domain (NC1mo) was reacted with crosslinked dimeric with sulfilimine bond (NC1di) suggested that FPM incubation significantly enhanced PXDN's enzymatic performance, subunits ( [Figure 4I](#fig4)). Taken suggest that the pro-crosslink potential of FPM is attributed to the aberrant enzyme activity of PXDN adsorbed on its surface. Next, we gave an insight into the mechanism of PXDN's tampered catalysis. Recent emerging evidence suggests that phase transition (or separation) is a common way to regulate proteins' activity ( [Huang et al., 2019](#bib32)). Phase transition refers to the process that macromolecular solution condenses into liquid droplets, solids, or gels ( [O'Flynn and Mittag, 2021](#bib48); [Boeynaems et al., 2018](#bib13)) in response to certain physicochemical stimuli, sharply increasing the macromolecule's concentration and separating them from the surrounding compartments ( [Alberti et al., 2019](#bib1); [Peeples and Rosen, 2021](#bib50)). Such enrichment affects the subsequent biochemical reactions. Thus, we asked whether the FPM's adsorption could induce the PXDN's phase transition, thus disturbing the latter's enzymatic activity. Taking PM1 as an example, with a series of microscopic observations, we found the formation of PXDN's liquid-like droplets in LH after its incubation the PXDN alone in LH under the same processing time and imaging parameters, no assemblies are observed. Moreover, the profiles of fluorescence distribution further indicated the phase-separating PXDN's accumulation was initialized on the PM1, evident colocalization ( [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 4B](/articles/75345/figures#fig4s4)). Besides, to characterize the dynamic nature of the droplets, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments. FRAP studies revealed that fluorescence of the bleached region of PXDN droplets could be partially recovered in minutes after photobleaching ( [Figure 4K and L](#fig4)). The reversible characteristic observed for PXDN droplets on PM1 further validated that PXDN underwent phase separation. More interestingly, the droplet-like accumulation of PXDN on FPM could also be observed in M2-10B4 cells ( [Figure 4D](#fig4)). Overall, these results indicated that the increased activity for PXDN's crosslinking Col IV was triggered by its phase transition on the FPM surface. Furthermore, we theoretically inferred the relationship of PXDN's phase separation with its enzymatic performance. First, we focused on the low-complexity domains in PXDN sequence, which could drive phase transition and be predicted by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs; [Figure 4\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/75345/figures#fig4s5)). The analysis indicated that PXDN's phase separation might occur at sequence 200-400 aa, which shows a higher IDR score ( [Alberti et al., 2019](#bib1)). More importantly, it is away from PXDN's activity center (800-1200 aa) according to the spatial structure in SWISS-MODEL, giving us a hint that PXDN's phase transition on FPM surface might not lead to deformation of PXDN's catalytic center and loss of its function. Next, protein-protein interactive docking simulation was performed at the interface of PXDN with its substrate NC1 domain through in solution, and three monomers of PXDN are linked by disulfide bonds at the indicated flexible linker region in the residual noncatalytic domains ( [Bathish et al., 2018](#bib8)). According to the reported modeled structure of PXDN ( [Paumann-Page et al., 2020](#bib49)), its trimeric peroxidase a triangular arrangement. However, oversized trimerization of PXDN might not get in contact thoroughly with its substrate ( [L\u00e1z\u00e1r et al., 2015](#bib40)). So we chose the PXDN monomer with the exposed enzymatic surface contacting with NC1 domain to simulate its function at solution state. The computational result indicated that once PXDN triggered phase separation, which transferred from the solution state to the aggregation one (the putative assembly structure created through homology modeling) ( [Bernardes et al., 2015](#bib10)), the interactive area at the NC1 interface would be notably increased, thus facilitating the enzymatic catalysis. Inhibiting PXDN ameliorates FPM-induced tumorigenesis Based on the above findings, we speculated that inhibiting PXDN could abolish ECM change and recover CTLs migration in the lung. To testify to our hypothesis, the effect of the plasmids capable of ectopically expressing PXDN-specific short hairpin RNA (PXDN shRNA, shPXDN) efficiency ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 1](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s1)), shPXDN mixed in the in vivo-jetPEI gene transfer regent was delivered into murine lung tissue through trachea injection, as illustrated in [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 2](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s2). The assessment of Col IV with a different fraction ('low-cross' ones and 'high-cross' ones) measured by ELISA revealed that the shPXDN diminished crosslinked level of Col IV ( [Figure 5A](#fig5)). Masson's trichrome staining images and SEM observation also confirmed that the shPXDN effectively decreased collagen density and expanded interstitial space ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 3](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s3)). More importantly, the ameliorative Col IV network induced by shPXDN further recovered the migration and accumulation of CTLs in lung tissue 1 day after the LLC stimulation, revealed as the CTLs' migration trajectory images and the immunofluorescent staining ( [Figure and C](#fig5)). Flow cytometry analysis further demonstrated that shPXDN efficiently reversed the CTLs' infiltration in the all](/articles/75345/figures#fig5) inspired us to assess the effect of shPXDN in suppressing the tumor progress induced by FPM, as illustrated in [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 5](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s5). Encouragingly, our data showed that the shPXDN significantly suppressed tumor growth, diminished tumor grade, and reduced tumor number and burden ( [Figure 6](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s6)) in both KrasG12DTrp53-/- transgenic model and LLC model. These results suggested the feasibility of inhibiting PXDN as a potential therapeutic target for FPM-associated lung cancer. Moreover, the efficacy of small-molecule therapeutic doses ( [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 7](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s7)). To be satisfactory, both [Figure 5\u2014figure supplement 8](/articles/75345/figures#fig5s8)), further expanding the strategy for lung cancer treatment. Discussion Although inhalable particles from air pollutants and tobacco smoke have clearly been identified as a potent carcinogen to humans, its pathological mechanism remains unclear, which hampers the design of therapeutic approaches. Existing findings, though supporting that FPM induces lung cancer, provide insufficient and inconsistent explanations for the underlying mechanism. In this study, we have discovered an unexpected mechanism that, as shown in [Figure 6](#fig6), apart from directly targeting tumor cells, the inhaled FPM changes the formation of lung tissue matrix to prevent the infiltration of T lymphocytes and their antitumor immunosurveillance, which consequently accelerates lung tumorigenesis. Our study was inspired by an unanswered, fundamental question - which component in the lung tissue is first affected by FPM? Most previous studies suggest that FPM directly acts on cells by inducing gene mutation and increasing malignant 'seed cells' in the affected lung ( [Somers et al., 2004](#bib57)). They further suggest that the particles carry chemical reagents, such as [Hecht, 2002](#bib30)), into the lung to exert such effects. However, the respiratory tract is exposed to various environmental substances (e.g., O2 or O3) that are much more powerful in damaging DNA, more abundant in the air, and more soluble in the tissue than the above chemicals. It requires further explanation of how these assumed mutagens, delivered in a trace amount by the particles into the lung tissue, could significantly increase lung cancer incidence. Moreover, FPM from different locations carries distinct types of those carcinogens existing in the local environment, but these highly various particles exert the same carcinogenic effect ( [Kelly and Fussell, 2012](#bib37)), which is unexplainable. Additionally, in vitro, FPM is considered more capable of entering the cell than larger particles ( [Gratton et al., 2008](#bib26)) (such as the PM10, i.e., the particulate matter with the diameter of 1-10 m); but in vivo, particles are difficult to directly contact with cells due to the barrier effects from sticky body fluids and gel-like ECM proteins ( [Fernandes et al., 2009](#bib22)). Since inhaled particles are mostly accumulated in the ECM ( [Engin et al., 2017](#bib21)), there is no reason to ignore the impact of ECM and only focus on the interaction between particles and cells. Thus, we suspected that the lung tissue ECM, apart from the cells, could also be affected by the particles. Indeed, ECM abnormality is closely correlated with cancer development. On the one hand, the clinical samples showed the developed tumor was surrounded by a dense collagen matrix; on the other hand, one typical example is that tissue fibrosis often precipitates tumor development in the same tissue - such as liver cirrhosis progressing into hepatoma and pulmonary fibrosis leading to lung ( [Cox and Erler, 2016](#bib17); [Tzouvelekis et al., 2020](#bib62)). These clinical and experimental proven reports prompt us to investigate the pathological change of FPM-stimulated lung interstitial ECM and its role in lung tumorigenesis. Our experimental findings validated this assumption by demonstrating - and elucidating the mechanism of - FPM-induced alteration in the interstitial lung structure. As soon as we, for the first time, found that FPM in the LH dramatically enhanced the crosslinking of soluble Col IV, we speculated that a specific biomolecule in LH enriched on the FPM surface mediates this action. With proteomics tools, we identified PXDN; this enzyme, specialized in catalyzing collagen network formation ( [Bhave et al., 2012](#bib11)), is enriched in the protein corona of FPM, enabling FPM to mediate ECM remodeling. Meanwhile, for PXDN, its adsorption onto FPM triggered its aberrant enzymatic activity through a 'phase-transition' process, which further disturbs Col IV crosslinking and the organization of the lung interstitial space. Pretreatment using PXDN inhibitor could alleviate the tumor-promoting effect of FPM. Therefore, an aberrant ECM remodeling mediated by enriched PXDN in the particle corona is the key pathological change caused by FPM. Our study further elucidates how such a change in ECM accelerates tumor development. As a consequence of FPM treatment, the denser Col IV and more compacted interstitial space in lung tissue would hinder the migration of CTLs, which are the most 'informed' defender to protect against potential cancer and delay malignant progression ( [DuPage et al., 2011](#bib20); [Krummel et al., 2016](#bib38)). Once CTLs' migration track was blocked, the CTLs' infiltration would be impaired, thus decreasing the chance of cell-cell cytotoxic interaction to tumor cells in lung tissue ( [Hanahan and Coussens, 2012](#bib29)). According to the correlation between tumor mutation burden and immune infiltration in lung tumors ( [Zhang et al., 2022](#bib74); [Thorsson et al., 2018](#bib61); [Helleday et al., 2014](#bib31)), we speculated that the deficiency further aggravated the mutation of cancerous cells in the lung tissue. The insufficiency of CTLs' early response to tumor cells results in weakened immune surveillance and unmonitored mutation that in turn accelerate tumorigenesis. All the evidence recapitulates how FPM accelerated the development of lung cancer by interfering with the lung immune microenvironment, shedding light on the sequential consequences between particle-induced ECM remodeling, impaired immunosurveillance, and tumorigenesis. Taken together, our study reveals a completely new mechanism by which inhaled fine particles promote lung tumor development. This mechanism is notable in three aspects. First, we herein provide direct evidence that protein corona on those foreign objects can elicit such a significant and adverse effect. Although corona formation on nanoparticles has been extensively studied in recent years, its involvement in a pathogenic process related to a global health issue is rare. Our findings here highlight the importance of the corona-endowed, 'new' enzymatic bioactivity of nanomaterials in vivo - and in a particular tissue. The data suggests that coronas adsorbed from the environment could also be catalytic, other than simply transforming the cellular and higher-level interactions, in agreement with other literature ( [Dawson and Yan, 2021](#bib18); [Shang et al., 2021](#bib56)). Second, PXDN, or other proteins mainly engaged in ECM modulation, is less expected as a major player in lung carcinogenesis, especially at the initial stage, until this study reveals it as a specific and unexpected molecular target for FPM. These investigations enable the specific design of PXDN-targeted preventive or therapeutic approaches. The relationship between the physicochemical properties of FPM and the affected PXDN activity should be further explored in greater detail. Third, in a specific organ (the lung), our data demonstrate that physical blockage of immunocytes movement directly increases tumorigenesis, which suggests an important previously unconsidered role of the in vivo delivering or deploying the power of the immune system in various immune-oncology processes. Materials and methods FPM collection and preparation [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-1) FPM samples within sizes of 1 m were collected using TH-16A multiple-channel atmospheric particulate automatic sampler (Wuhan Tianhong Instrument Ltd., Wuhan, China) and filtered through Whatman PTFE membranes (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, USA). For particles in air pollutants (PM1), samples were conducted continuously for 7 days at different representatives of Nanjing City (Qixia, Jiangning, Pukou, Gulou, and Gaochun) in Jiangsu Province, Suzhou City in Anhui Province, and Tieling City in Liaoning Province (named as GC, SZ, and the residual smoke of burned tobaccos with filters was collected in a customized confined space. Then, PTFE filter membranes containing FPM were cut into 0.1 cm \u00d7 0.1 cm pieces, immersed in distilled water for 2 days, and oscillated ultrasonically for 1 hr three times. Detached FPM was separated with filter membranes after centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min three times. Supernatant-enriched FPMs were vacuum freeze-dried and then stored at -20.

CCK-8 kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was used to examine the proliferation of LLC at indicated time points, with cells treated with 1\u00d7 PBS as control. To further analyze the effect of FPM on the migration potential of T cells, the CTLs were stimulated with 10 g/mL FPM, which showed slight cytotoxic, for 48 hr. Establishment and treatment of lung tumor model in FPM-exposed mice FPM-exposed mice [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-5-1) Mice exposed to FPM were generated according to a previously published method ( [Wang et al., 2017](#bib66)). 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice or Foxn1nu naked mice of the same ground were purchased from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China). OT-1 T cell receptor transgenic mice (C57BL/6-Tg [TcraTcrb] 1100Mjb/J) were a gift from K. Zeng (Nanjing University). These mice were randomly divided into three groups (PBS ones, FPM-exposed ones: PM1 and TSP; each group contained at least three mice). Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital sodium at 45 mg/kg body weight. After the trachea were exposed by opening the neck skin and blunt dissection, mice received suspension of 0.2 mg FPM in a total volume of 50 L of sterile physiological saline by inserting a 7-gauge needle (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) into the trachea transorally. To be estimated, before intratracheal instillation, FPM suspension was always sonicated and vortexed. After the site of surgery was sutured and cleaned with penicillin, the mice were allowed to recover until they were sacrificed. As a control, PBS was applied in a similar manner. After being exposed to FPM for 7 days, mice were (1) sacrificed for analyzing the changes of lung tissue structure or (2) subsequently stimulated with 5 g/kg T cell chemokine - C-X-C motif 2014](#bib27)), or named as interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) for 2 hr through intratracheal injection, to analyze the CTLs' infiltration into lung tissue, and (3) to analyze the location of PXDN and FPM in the lung, mice were exposed to rhodamine-labeled FPM (R-FPM) with intraperitoneal injection.

In some experiments, tissue sections were pretreated with 50 g/mL collagenase D (Worthington Biochemical Corp., CO) in RPMI 1640 for 5 min, then rinsed in complete RPMI 1640 medium. Cell preparation [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-6-2) Jurkat T cells were stained with Calcein-AM (Dojindo Laboratories) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and then washed with HBSS (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China) three times. 1.5 \u00d7 105 T cells totally in 10-20 L were added at one side of the cut surface of each slice. To ensure cells settle down on the slice, slices with T cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, gently washed to remove the residual cells that had not entered the tissue, and kept at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 before imaging. Time-lapse imaging and cell trajectory analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-6-3) For imaging T cells' migration on the lung tissue slice, 5 g/mL IP-10 were added on the other side of the slice and images were then acquired in time-lapse model with a SP5 confocal system (Leica) every 3 min for 1 hr. Imaging was exported and compressed into videos in .AVI format. To quantify T cell trajectories with the surrounding ECM in lung tissue, the cell migration video including image sequence cell migration was analyzed with TimTaxis Software ( [https://www.wimasis.com/en/WimTaxis](https://www.wimasis.com/en/WimTaxis)) by identification of the centroids of individual cells at consecutive time points. The relationship of statistical data composed of displacement, distance, velocity, and acceleration vs. time was respectively further analyzed. Extraction of soluble collagen IV [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-7) To generate soluble collagen IV, the fused mouse bone marrow fibroblast M2-10B4 cells were plated at high density and maintained at confluency for 7 days in the presence of 50 g/mL ascorbic acid (Sangon Biotech), with media changes every 24-36 hr. Crosslinking was inhibited by supplementing the culture conditions with indicated concentrations (0, 50, 100, 200, 300, and 500 M) of PHG. PHG and ascorbic acid treatments were initiated upon confluency. With the 200 M PHG, which could be sufficient to inhibit the Col IV crosslink, after the M2-10B4 cells were stimulated for 7 days and collected through scrape, cultured cells and matrix were homogenized in 1% (w/v) deoxycholate (Aladdin) with sonication, and the insoluble material isolated after centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. Then, the pellet was lysed with RPMI (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) in ice for 30 min. The supernatant containing soluble Col IV was collected after centrifugation at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 10 min and then incubated with 1 mg/mL FPM per se, 1 mL LH or the mixture of FPM-LH (with the volume ratio of 1:10) for 4 hr. Then, the samples were collected for further WB analysis to detect the change of Col IV crosslink. Besides, to perform cellular experimental analysis, the M2-10B4 cells were incubated with 200 M PHG for 24 hr and then treated with the same stimulation for 24 hr. The cell samples were collected for further IF analysis. Analysis of crosslinking extent of different collagen [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-8) Collagen crosslink was assessed biochemically by separating different collagen fractionation via serial extractions, including neutral salt (freshly secreted collagens and procollagens), acetic acid (more mature (fibrillar, moderately crosslinked collagens) and insoluble high-crosslink ones from fresh lung tissue as reported in the literature ( [Popov et al., 2011](#bib52); [Ikenaga et al., 2017](#bib33)). Briefly, the whole-lung tissue was homogenized in neutral salt buffer (0.5 M NaCl, 0.05 M Tris, pH 7.5; Sangon Biotech) and incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight on a rotary shaker. After centrifugation at 24,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected (fraction A: neutral salt-soluble collagen). The resulting pellet was then extracted with 0.5 M acetic acid (fraction B: acid-soluble collagen; Sangon Biotech), followed by pepsin (2 M acetic acid, fraction C: pepsin-soluble collagen; Sangon Biotech). The remaining insoluble fraction D represents mature, highly crosslinked collagen. Then, type I, III, and IV collagens with different extractions were analyzed with corresponding ELISA kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).

For the oxidized BSA, aspartate (13 mg) was added to 50 mg/mL BSA in PBS (2 mL), followed by the addition of a solution of ferric chloride (10 \u00b5L, 10 mM) and left to stir at room temperature overnight. A BSA protein standard without the addition of ferric chloride was run in parallel as a control. Analysis of PXDN enzyme activity and reaction Measurement of PXDN activity [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-10-1) To analyze the effect of FPM on PXDN, the enzyme activity was analyzed with Amplex Hydrogen Peroxidase Assay Kit ( [P\u00e9terfi et al., 2009](#bib51)) (Thermo Scientific). Briefly, after incubated with FPM for 30 min at 37, the enzyme activity was detected in reaction containing 50 mM Amplex Red reagent, 1 mM H2O2, and PXDN (PeproTech) mixed in FPM. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, fluorescence was measured at excitation wavelength 590 nm with a fluorescence microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific). To avoid interference of particles per se, the equal FPM was set as negative control. Analysis of PXDN enzyme kinetics [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-10-2) To detect the change of PXDN catalytic efficiency after its incubation with FPM, PXDN enzyme kinetic behaviors were investigated according to the Michaelis-Menten model. Briefly, after incubated with FPM for 30 min at 37, 10 mU PXDN was mixed with a serial concentration of H2O2 (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 M). The enzymatic reaction was analyzed by adding 50 mM Amplex Red detection reagent ( [Li et al., 2012](#bib41)). The fluorescent reaction was measured every 40 s for 8 min and subsequently every 5 min six times using a microplate reader (Thermo Scientific) with the enzyme kinetics model. Line weaver-Burk representative plot was generated from the relationship of reaction rate and substrate concentration. Based on the plot, the Michaelis constant (Km) reflecting the binding efficiency of the enzyme with the substrate and turnover number (Kcat) indicating the enzymatic efficiency were calculated. Detection of hypobromous acid [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-10-3) Based on the fact that NADH could be stably brominated into NADH bromohydrin after its reaction with hypobromous acid, hypobromous acid generated by PXDN and its bromination activity was tested by TripleTOF 4600 LC-MS/MS according to the reported literature with a little modification ( [Bathish et al., 2018](#bib8)). Briefly, 100 nM PXDN or mixture of PXDN and FPM was incubated at 37\u00b0C in PBS containing 200 M NADH and 200 M NaBr for 30 min. Reactions were started upon addition of 100 M H2O2.

Then, HOCl production was calculated according to the standard curve of a serial concentration of HOCl vs. absorbance. To be estimated, HOCl standards should be freshly prepared by adjusting the pH of NaClO to 7.4 to create HOCl solutions before each time. Measurement of NC1 crosslink by PXDN [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-10-5) To delineate sulfilimine crosslink of fragment in the collagen IV, the solubilized NC1 monomer purified from mouse renal basement membrane (Chondrex, Inc, WA, USA) was incubated with PXDN or the mixture of PXDN and FPM. To initiate the reaction, 100 M H2O2 and 200 M NaBr were respectively added. After incubation for 30 min at 37, to visualize the change sulfilimine crosslinked dimeric nonreducing conditions followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Preparation and separation of FPM's protein corona [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-11) First, LH was extracted from the lungs of healthy mice according to the institutional bioethics approval. Briefly, the extracted lung tissue samples were homogenized in equal volumes of 1\u00d7 PBS by a homogenizer (approximately three mice/mL LH), and then centrifuged to remove the debris to obtain LH. 10 mg/mL FPM were incubated with LH at the volume ratio of 1:10 under stirring at 4\u00b0C for the indicated time. Then, the mixture was centrifuged through a 0.3 M sucrose cushion for 20 min at 4\u00b0C at 15,300 \u00d7 g in order to separate the nanoparticle-corona complexes. Then, after rinsing with 1\u00d7 PBS three times, proteins in the corona were eluted by adding RIPM lysis buffer (50 mM Tris Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) to the pellet on ice for 1 hr. After centrifugation (20 min at 15,300 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C), the supernatant-enriching protein corona was collected and stored at -20\u00b0C. LC-MS analysis and database searches of protein corona [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-12) The protocol to analyze protein with LC-MS adhered to a method described previously ( [Wang et al., 2017](#bib66); [Zhang et al., 2015](#bib73)). Briefly, after samples were quantified with bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit, 100 g total protein was reduced by adding 1 M DL-dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich; 60\u00b0C, 1 hr), and free cysteines were alkylated with 1 M iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich; room temperature, 10 min in the dark). The alkylated proteins were centrifuged in the 10K ultrafiltration tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the proteins were retained in the 10K ultrafiltration tube. The proteins were further washed with 100 mM tetratehylammonium bromide three times at 4\u00b0C for 20 min by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. Then, the protein was digested with 2 g porcine sequencing grade trypsin (LC-MS Grade, Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37\u00b0C. After digestion, the resulting peptides were collected (12,000 rpm, 20 min, 4\u00b0C), desalted by Zeba Spin Desalting Columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and further enriched by C18 reversed-phase columns (Epoch Life Science, Missouri City, TX). The samples were then subjected to LC-MS analysis. To identify the composition of protein corona, identification of peptides and proteins from continuum LC-MS data was performed with the ProteinPilot 4.5 software (AB SCIEX). Proteins were analyzed by searching the mouse taxon of the UniProtKB/SwissProt database (release 2011_11). The proteins with at least one specific high-scoring peptides were detected and exported from ProteinPilot for the final LC-MS data file at the protein level. Identification and characterization of PXDN's liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) Microscopy analysis of LLPS [Request detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-13-1) To analyze the droplet formation of PXDN under the stimulation of FPM, 10 mM fluorescein FPM for 30 min in LH. Then, samples of different groups were dropped onto a glass slide and sealed with a coverslip. Phase separation of PXDN and its liquid-like droplets was observed under phase-contrast and confocal microscopy with a 100\u00d7 Oil objective (Nikon). The distribution profiles of fluorescence intensity of liquid-like PXDN and FPM were respectively analyzed with the Nikon NIS-Elements software. Besides, to predict the domain that might trigger PXDN's accumulation, the intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), the domain frequently closed to proteins' phase separation, of PXDN is predicted incubated with 50 rhodamine B-labeled LH, photobleaching (FRAP) experiments were performed on FITC-labeled PXDN droplets formed in PM1. The photorecovery behavior was tracked using the 488 nm laser line of a 40 \u00d7 1.0 NA objective on Zeiss LSM 980 with 2.4-fold magnification. Photobleaching was done with 100% laser power to 30% intensity using the bleaching program of the ZEN software, and time-lapse images were recorded every 10 s. After bleaching, the fluorescence intensities were measured and collected by mean ROI (photo-bleached region and control region without bleach). The raw data with three bleach treatments were processed and analyzed with GraphPad Prism. Molecular docking on the effect of phase separation on enzymatic reaction [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-14) Template crystal structures of PXDN and NC1 domain in Col IV were identified and downloaded from Swiss Model Protein Data Bank as PDB files (PXDN: 5MFA.1A; NC1: 5NAY). Besides, the putative structure under phase transition, which simulated the PXDN assembly, was created through homology modeling based on one experimentally determined structure of PXDN-related family member (PDB ID: 4C1M) in the RCSB Protein Data Bank ( [Bernardes et al., 2015](#bib10)). Subsequently, the most similar template conformation with 49.8% consistency was chosen from among the candidates and named as the PXDN Dimer. Then, ZDock protocol was used for molecular docking analysis of the interaction between PXDN and NC1 (respectively for the 'solution state' to the 'assembly state'). Docking models of the intuitive contacting interface were outputted after scoring and selection. The interactive area was especially labeled. Western blotting [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-15) According to the standard protocol, different proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. To be estimated, the proteins in corona from the nanoparticles were eluted with equal and adequate PAGE sample buffer containing 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma-Aldrich) and the same volume of eluted corona proteins was analyzed. Besides, to further estimate the content of PXDN adsorbed on the FPM, different amounts of PXDN (50, 100, 500, 1000, and 2000 ng), together with the corona protein samples, were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by WB. Then, the proteins were transferred onto the polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad, CA). The membranes were blocked with skim milk and then incubated with primary antibody - PXDN (Merck Millipore), type I collagen (Col I, Boster Biological Technology Co. Ltd., Wuhan, China), type III collagen (Col III, ABclonal Technology, Wuhan, China), type IV collagen (Col IV, Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Abcam) at 4\u00b0C with gentle shaking overnight. After being washed with PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 five times, the membrane antirabbit, antimouse, or antigoat IgG (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) at room temperature. After rinsing, positive signal was visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Cell Signaling Technology). The band intensity was quantitated using ImageJ software ( [http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/)), and the statistical analysis of three independent experiments was performed. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-16) RNA of cells or lung tissues were extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies). For mRNA detection, RT-PCR was launched in an ABI 7300 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the SYBR Prime Script RT-PCR Kit (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). Each sample was analyzed in triplicates and repeated for three or four independent assays with -actin as internal control. Primers of and PXDN are listed as Lung tissues were digested with 2 mg/mL collagenase type I and IV (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30 min to generate a single-cell suspension. Cell suspensions were filtered through 70 m cell strainers, and red blood cells were lysed. For the intracellular staining, 1 \u00d7 106 cells/mL were treated with the cell activation cocktail (BioLegend, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After cells were washed with PBS containing 1% BSA, cells were blocked with 1% BSA at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. Zombie Violet Fixable Viability Kit was used for live/dead cell determination. Then, cells were stained on ice for 30 min with with the fixation/permeabilization solution kiT (BD Biosciences) and stained with cytokine PE anti-mouse interferon gamma (IFN-) antibodies in the dark for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged at 400-500 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C to remove unbound antibody. After rinsing three times, each sample was resuspended for analysis using a BD Fluorescence-Activated (BD Biosciences). Unconjugated antibodies and IgG controls were run in parallel to set the background. All antibodies and their isotype control antibodies were obtained from BioLegend. Enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISpot) [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-18) tissues exposed to PBS or FPM were excised after the intravenous stimulation of LLC-OVA cells for 1 day. After CTLs were separated, 1 \u00d7 105 CTLs were added in each well of IFN- antibody precoated plate and stimulated by 4 \u00d7 104 irradiated LLC-OVA cells or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA, the positve for in RPMI-1640 kit (Dakewe Biotech Co., Ltd.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were analyzed by Lung tissue samples were collected, frozen at optimal cutting temperature (OCT) medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cut into sections. The sections or M2-10B4 cells incubated with 10 g/mL rhodamine-labeled FPM and 1 g/mL PXDN (at the volume ratio of 1:10) for 1 hr were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich) and stained with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. The primary antibodies included PXDN, Col I, Col III, Col IV, and CD8. Next, the sections were incubated with secondary antibody Alexa Fluor (Life Technologies) for 1 hr at room temperature, followed by 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Beyotime) for nuclear staining. Then, the sections were imaged by LSM 980 with Airyscan 2 confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). To further characterize the crosslink level, based on IF mages of Col IV, look-up table (LUT) analysis based on the fluorescence intensity, surface plot analysis based on the invert binary distance of fluorescence distribution, was respectively accomplished using ImageJ (ImageJ Software, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Using the 'ridge detection' plugin in ImageJ, binary images of Col IV network were generated, and the related quantitative analysis of junction number and junction density was created and compared. Besides, the EdU-positive percentage was analyzed using the Bioapps Tools in ZEISS ZEN 3.4 (Carl Zeiss). Histological studies [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-20) The lung tissue fixed in 2.5% PFA was embedded in paraffin and cut into sections for the H&E and Masson's trichrome staining (NanJing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) according to the manufacturer's instructions with slight modification. Stained sections were photographed at different magnification under a microscope. Under blindfold conditions with standard light microscopy, tumor burden (based on the percentage of the area of tumor regions versus that of total lung) according to H&E-stained sections of all five lung lobes was quantified with ImageJ software. Besides, to observe the interstitial ECM structure, lung tissues were fixed with glutaraldehyde at 4\u00b0C for 48 hr, dehydrated with an ethanol gradient, and dried at the critical point. Then, the samples were sprayed with gold particles and observed with SEM (SFEG Leo 1550, AMO GmbH, Aachen, Germany). Statistical analysis [Request a detailed protocol](https://bio-protocol.org/eLIFErap75345?item=s4-21) The results are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Data were statistically analyzed using Prism Software (GraphPad) and assessed for normality or homogeneity of variance. Differences between multiple groups were compared using one-way or two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's tests or, if appropriate, repeated-measures ANOVA test with post-hoc Bonferroni correction. Differences between the two groups were evaluated using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test. A value of p<0.05 was considered significant; n.s. indicates not significant.

Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors): I would say this is a most interesting paper with novel thinking. It is a big ambitious hypothesis, with many interwoven issues and steps, and a single paper would find it hard to conclusively prove such a claim. I would therefore suggest that the paper be published because it is sufficiently well argued to make the idea credible, but would also suggest to the authors to couch their language in a more cautious manner. I know this is sometimes hard to do when one is being reviewed, but maybe the Editor would allow some possibility for the authors to self critique from a secure basis. Personally, I think the article will come across much better, and having confidence in the ideas, I would like to see that. I think everyone concerned will be well aware of the impossibility of conclusive arguments based on the limited scale of study and examples provided in Figure1,2. In my view the data seems sufficiently strong to somewhat support the claims, but this will always be questioned. Obviously, part of Figure 3 really purports to establish that the cross linking is catalysed by this 'corona'. [1] For obvious reasons I would be anxious to make absolutely sure of this effect, for once that is done (as it can be shown in simple physiochemical manners), the rest seemed strongly likely. The in vitro mechanistic verification is particularly important in my view because it excludes many of the other cellular effects that themselves could also lead to aberrant matrix, and if it could be made conclusive would I think be itself of great interest. It belongs to a small but growing group of claims in which coronas adsorbed from the environment are catalytic [2] rather than simply transform the cellular and higher level interactions [3]. So, I would ask the authors if they can envisage a really more conclusive experiment for this effect? Can they make a quasi-quantitative experiment in which the evolution of the reaction can be followed? Can they poison the peroxidasin most convincing in these experiments, and see what happens? I think it is possible. I would also comment, though this could be more of a discussion point, that the cross-linking hypothesis should be affected by different kinds of bare particle surfaces since their propensity to adsorb will change with the original surface. I am not sure this study is really necessary in such a hypothesis building paper, but certainly if I were the authors, I would want to have a series of particles with different adsorbed species and propensities and the levels of peroxidasin correlated with the effects. Again, not a trivial experiment do well, and be sure the original bare surface is stable in situ etc, but feasible. My feeling is that this should be published, possibly with some consideration of points made by reviewers, but it looks really important for the community to see. [1] Nat. Nanotechnol. 16, #2 (Recommendations for the authors): 1) Why did the authors focus on PM1 rather than PM2.5 or PM10? How was the administration dose of FPM selected? 2) For Figure 1I and 1J, to further validate the crucial role of CTLs' insufficiency induced by FPM in lung tumorigenesis, the effect of the adoptively transferred CTLs on the tumor burden of FPM-exposed nude mice should be detected. 3) Also, to testify an immune response closely mediates the FPM's pro-tumorigenesis activity, the EdU staining in the lung tissue of nude mice should be supplemented to exclude the direct role of FPM on tumor cells. 4) Figure 4 showed that FPM increased peroxidasin (PXDN) activity. Other than upregulating the enzymatic activity, does the FPM affect PXDN's expression in the lung tissue? 5) In Figure 1F, 5C and 5D, flow cytometry was performed to analyze the CTLs in lung tissue one day or indicated time after LLC stimulation. The authors should discuss whether the FPM exposure also induced the change of other immune cells, especially NK. 6) This study mainly detects the effect of FPM exposure on extracellular matrix and immune response during the early stage of tumorigenesis. The long-term impact of the inhaled particles on lung tumors should also be discussed. 7) For Materials and methods, more details in the section of 'Molecular Docking on The Effect of Phase Separation on Enzymatic Reaction.' should be provided. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): Overall, the hypothesis was tested carefully with both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the data was convincing. I only have a few comments: 1. A discussion of the hypothesis with patient data would further strengthen the arguments. The tobacco smoke induces a unique mutational signature in lung cancer tissue (a C>A transversion, or signature 4 as reviewed in Helleday et al., 2014, Nature Review Genetics). It would be interesting to test whether the presence of smoke mutational signature (or the smoke history of patients) is associated with decreased infiltration of T cells or an immunosuppressive microenvironment in lung cancer patients. Such association may be tested using processed data in TCGA datasets of lung cancer patients. The mutational signatures are available in Alexandrove et al., 2013 and the immune cell fractions in tumors are available in Thorsson V et al., 2018.

While it is convincing that the PXDN plays a role in mediating the FPM effects on collagen crosslinking, it is unclear whether PXDN is the only enzyme in this process. Many other proteins were detected in the \"protein corona\". Is it possible to estimate the relative abundance of PXDN on FPM? If not, it may be explained in the discussion for non-expert readers. 3. It is a nice piece of interdisciplinary work. Some details may be added for readers in different fields. For example, it is difficult to understand why a conformation change of the enzyme is referred to as \"phase separation\". 4.

I would therefore suggest that the paper be published because it is sufficiently well argued to make the idea credible, but would also suggest to the authors to couch their language in a more cautious manner.

Personally, I think the article will come across much better, and having confidence in the ideas, I would like to see that. Thanks for your suggestion. We have modified our description more cautiously, especially for the sentences related to FPM's pro-tumorigenesis potential and PXDN's phase separation. Obviously, part of Figure 3 really purports to establish that the cross linking is catalysed by this 'corona'. [1] For obvious reasons I would be anxious to make absolutely sure of this effect, for once that is done (as it can be shown in simple physiochemical manners), the rest seemed strongly likely. The in vitro mechanistic verification is particularly important in my view because it excludes many of the other cellular effects that themselves could also lead to aberrant matrix, and if it could be made conclusive would I think be itself of great interest. It belongs to a small but growing group of claims in which coronas adsorbed from the environment are catalytic [2] rather than simply transform the cellular and higher level interactions [3]. So, I would ask the authors if they can envisage a really more conclusive experiment for this effect? Can they make a quasi-quantitative experiment in which the evolution of the reaction can be followed? Can they poison the peroxidasin most convincing in these experiments, and see what happens? I think it is possible. These questions are extraordinarily inspiring and in line with our plan for future study. First, our finding fully supports the catalytic role of coronas. We had speculated that FPM increased collagen crosslinking by upregulating PXDN expression; however, the data showed no significant difference in the level of PXDN! From this observation, we started focusing on the catalytic activity of corona including PXDN adsorbed on FPM and, through hierarchical clustering, found these coronas rich in enzymes. We are glad to know our finding agrees with a growing group of claims that coronas adsorbed from the environment are catalytic (Nat. Nanotechnol. 2021.16,229.; Nat. Catal.,2021.4,607.). Next, as the reviewer pointed out, the in vitro mechanistic validation is important. We also analyzed the FPM-PXDN interaction in vitro by incubating the particles with the purified fulllength native peroxidasin. The data (including those in Figure 4E-4I) indicated that FPM incubation significantly enhanced PXDN's enzymatic performance. During these experiments, to quantitatively analyze the HOBr production generated by FPM-PXDN's catalytic process, LC-MS was employed to determine the bromination NADH 290, 1087; Cell. 2014.157,1380). We believe a more comprehensive study in future into the kinetics of enzyme-substrate reactions, based on dynamic quantification of this pair, would help describe this evolution process. As the reviewer wisely suggests, poisoning peroxidasin in vitro can also be an interesting experiment to perform. We will most likely use methods shown as below: 1) Because that the generation of crosslinked dimeric (NC1di) is directly related to the consumption monomeric subunits (NC1mo), the enzymatic performance of FPM/PXDN can be investigated with a NC1mo-to-NC1di conversion assay, followed by quantitative western blotting. Besides, after FPM and PXDN were incubated for the indicated time, NC1mo-to-NC1di transformation curves could be performed to analyze the correlation between the incubation time and the yield of NC1di. 2) To validate the catalytic reaction mediated by the FPM's surface, an active dimethyl labelling strategy combined with MS could be applied to systematically probe the lysine-proximal microenvironments of the FPM/PXDN complexes. It's reported that the lysine residues on the free enzyme are more easily accessed and labeled than those adsorbed on materials' surfaces (Nat. Catal. 2021.4,607.; Anal. Chem. 2016. 88, 12060.). Thus, this method could reflect the state of PXDN. 3) For poisoning the peroxidasin in in vitro experiments, perhaps the adsorption of peroxidasin could be competitively inhibited by the addition of some other targeted proteins by utilizing the preference of FPM's protein corona. If feasible, it inspires us to design the therapeutic method to prevent FPM's biological risk by modulating its protein corona. I would also comment, though this could be more of a discussion point, that the cross-linking hypothesis should be affected by different kinds of bare particle surfaces since their propensity to adsorb will change with the original surface. I am not sure this study is really necessary in such a hypothesis building paper, but certainly if I were the authors, I would want to have a series of particles with different adsorbed species and propensities and the levels of peroxidasin correlated with the effects. We appreciate this suggestion and agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting topic to explore in our future study. In the current study, due to the complexity of the environmentally collected FPM, we mixed an equal proportion of different samples to eliminate the interference of sampling resources and discovered peroxidasin as the biomarker in the corona related to crosslinking. In future, we can study the physicochemical features of individual samples and their absorbed PXDN levels, followed by linking the abundance to eventual tumorigenic activities. Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors): 1) Why did the authors focus on PM1 rather than PM2.5 or PM10? How was the administration dose of FPM selected? 1) According to the reports related to the fractional deposition of particulate matters inhaled into the respiratory tract (Respirology.2012. 17, 1031.), the nanosized components with a diameter less than 1 m (PM1) displayed the highest deposition efficiency in the alveolar and bronchioles region. Besides, these particles are more likely to disturb the encounters when they interact with cells or subcellular components due to their extraordinarily high number concentrations per given mass and increased surface area per unit mass (Environ. Health. Perspect. 2005. 113, 823.). Thus, we focused on the effect of PM1 on lung tissue. 2) For the FPM-exposed experimental model, previous studies adopted different methods. The administration dose ranged from 2 mg/kg to 30 mg/kg. We chose an average one at 10 mg/kg and exposed FPM to mice by intratracheal instillation. 2) For Figure 1I and 1J, to further validate the crucial role of CTLs' insufficiency induced by FPM in lung tumorigenesis, the effect of the adoptively transferred CTLs on the tumor burden of FPM-exposed nude mice should be detected. Although we did not adoptively transfer CTLs into the nude mice, its effect on the tumor burden could be predicted from Figure. 5C-5F. We observed significantly attenuated tumor development along with the recovery of CTLs' infiltration in the FPM-exposed lung tissue. These outcomes to some extent could testify CTLs' crucial role in FPM-related lung tumorigenesis. 3) Also, to testify an immune response closely mediates the FPM's pro-tumorigenesis activity, the EdU staining in the lung tissue of nude mice should be supplemented to exclude the direct role of FPM on tumor cells. This analysis is very interesting for our future study. The similar tumor burden and tumor number of nude mice suggested little difference in cancerous cells' proliferation after FPM exposure. This could be further validated by the EdU staining in Figure 1E. All these results remaindered us that the immune response might be the main attribution to the FPM's protumorigenesis activity. 4) Figure 4 showed that FPM increased peroxidasin (PXDN) activity. Other than upregulating the enzymatic activity, does the FPM affect PXDN's expression in the lung tissue? Thanks for this insightful question. Actually, in our preliminary experiment, we had speculated that FPM promoted Col IV crosslink by increasing PXDN's expression in the lung tissue. However, we analyzed the transcription and protein's expression level of PXDN through qRT-PCR and WB analysis and found little difference before and after FPM exposure. These interesting results pushed us to focus on the change of PXDN's enzymatic activity after its adsorption on FPM's surface. And that's the main reason why we explored the catalytic analysis of PXDN, rather than its direct cellular biological effect. 5) In Figure 1F, 5C and 5D, flow cytometry was performed to analyze the CTLs in lung tissue one day or indicated time after LLC stimulation. The authors should discuss whether the FPM exposure also induced the change of other immune cells, especially NK. We thank the reviewer for this excellent question. When T cells crawl in the lung tissue, the extracellular matrix serves as their migration scaffolds (Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2014. 14, 232). Similarly, NK cells use such migration strategies in the lung interstitial space (Trends. Cell Biol. 2020. 30, 818; ELife. 2022. 11, 76269). Based on our study, migrating CTLs could be repelled by dense ECM bundles induced by FPM. We speculated that the same scenario applies to NK cells. FPM exposure might also impair the NK's mobility in the lung tissue. 6) This study mainly detects the effect of FPM exposure on extracellular matrix and immune response during the early stage of tumorigenesis. The long-term impact of the inhaled particles on lung tumors should also be discussed. Indeed, the role of extracellular matrix and immune response on the cancerous cells varies along with the tumor development (Nat. Commun. 2020. 11, 5120; Front. Mol. Biosci. 2020. 6, 160.), including the initiation, growth, migration, and others. And vice versus, the ECM and immune cells could be dynamically regulated or educated by the tumor cells (Nat. Immunol. 2013. 14, 1014; Nature. 2021. 599, 673), which should be also taken into consideration. Taken together, it is challenging to predict the long-term impact of FPM on lung tumor development. But it is worth being explored in our further study. 7) For Materials and methods, more details in the section of 'Molecular Docking on The Effect of Phase Separation on Enzymatic Reaction.' should be provided. We have supplemented some details in the section of 'Molecular Docking on The Effect of Phase Separation on Enzymatic Reaction.' in the Revised Manuscript. Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors): Overall, the hypothesis was tested carefully with both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the data was convincing. I only have a few comments: 1. A discussion of the hypothesis with patient data would further strengthen the arguments. The tobacco smoke induces a unique mutational signature in lung cancer tissue (a C>A transversion, or signature 4 as reviewed in Helleday et al., 2014, Nature Review Genetics). It would be interesting to test whether the presence of smoke mutational signature (or the smoke history of patients) is associated with decreased infiltration of T cells or an immunosuppressive microenvironment in lung cancer patients. Such association may be tested using processed data in TCGA datasets of lung cancer patients. The mutational signatures are available in Alexandrove et al., 2013 and the immune cell fractions in tumors are available in Thorsson V et al., 2018. We appreciate this insightful suggestion. The mutational signature based on TCGA analysis and immune cell fractions in lung cancer tissue in the patient data could provide solid support for our study (Nature. 2013. 499, 214.; Science. 2013. 339, 1546; Nature. 2013. 500, 415; Immunity. 2018. 48, 812; Nat. Rev. Genet. 2014. 15, 585.). We have discussed this interesting issue in the Revised Manuscript. 2. While it is convincing that the PXDN plays a role in mediating the FPM effects on collagen crosslinking, it is unclear whether PXDN is the only enzyme in this process. Many other proteins were detected in the \"protein corona\". Is it possible to estimate the relative abundance of PXDN on FPM? If not, it may be explained in the discussion for non-expert readers. 1) The relative abundance of PXDN on FPM could be estimated according to its rank in the LC-MS list and the quantitative western blot. For the former one, we observed the PXDN both in PM1 and TSP's corona (PM1: 378/1488;TSP: 417/1290); for the latter one, as shown in Figure 4A, PXDN in the total protein absorbed on FPM was detected by Western blotting, with a serial content of recombinant protein as the standard control. The data showed that about 100 ng PXDN was tethered to FPM. 2) Indeed, PXDN is not the only one enzyme in the protein corona that might affect the collagen crosslink, which also include MPO, EPO, CAPN1 and others. Some of them even displayed higher abundance in the LC-MS list. But among these proteins, PXDN is the specifically one mediating the formation of sulfilimine bond, the central target of FPM's bioactivity. The activities of other proteins is hardly detectable, which might owe to their conformation change or misfolding during protein corona's formation (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013. 135, 17359.; Biomaterials.2021. 265, 120452; Adv Mater. 2019. 31, e1805740.). Thus, focused on PXDN, the one endows FPM with pro-crosslink activity, despite its abundance is ordinary. 3. It is a nice piece of interdisciplinary work. Some details may be added for readers in different fields. For example, it is difficult to understand why a conformation change of the enzyme is referred to as \"phase separation\". This is a great reminder. We have added the definition and characteristics of proteins' phase separation in the Revised Manuscript. 4. In Figure 4D, what does the purple color represent in the merged graph? In the merged photograph, this color represents the nuclear staining DAPI, except for the red rhodamine-labelled PXDN and green FITC-FPM. We have added it in the Revised Manuscript. 5. In Supplementary Table S2, a description of the column title, such as \"%Cov\", is needed. We have added the description in the Revised Supplementary Table S2. Finally, we sincerely thank the three experts for their valuable comments on our manuscript.

Here, we found that FOXP2 is overexpressed in human prostate cancer cells and prostate tumors, but its expression is absent in normal prostate epithelial cells and low in benign prostatic hyperplasia. FOXP2 is a FOX transcription factor family member and tightly associated with vocal development. To date, little is known regarding the link of FOXP2 to prostate cancer. We observed that high FOXP2 expression and frequent amplification are significantly associated with high Gleason score. Ectopic expression of FOXP2 induces malignant transformation of mouse NIH3T3 fibroblasts and human prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1. Conversely, FOXP2 knockdown suppresses the proliferation of prostate cancer cells. Transgenic overexpression of FOXP2 in the mouse the FOXP2-induced oncogenic phenotype. CUT&Tag assay identified FOXP2-binding sites located in MET and its associated gene HGF. Additionally, the novel recurrent FOXP2-CPED1 fusion identified in prostate tumors results in high expression of truncated FOXP2, which exhibit a similar capacity for malignant transformation. Together, our data indicate that FOXP2 is involved in tumorigenicity of prostate. "}
