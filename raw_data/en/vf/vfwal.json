Herbal medicine has been widely used in cardiovascular care in many countries for centuries. Despite a growing body of scientific evidence in support of the use of herbal medicine for the management of CVD, significant gaps exist in knowledge base surrounding mechanisms of action of these interventions. This project will focus on the evaluation of mechanisms of action of herbal formulations for coronary heart disease/stroke and vascular dementia, using both in vitro and in models. double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sailuotong (SLT), a standardised Chinese herbal medicine formula in patients with Vascular Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease Researchers: Prof. Dennis Chang, Prof. Alan Bensoussan Partner/Funding Body: Australia Shineway Technology Pty Ltd Electronic health record data capture and management in Chinese medicine consultations Researchers: Prof. Athula Ginige, Prof. Alan Xiaoshu Zhu Partner/Funding Body: Surity Pty Ltd and University of Western Sydney Joint Chair Program in Traditional Chinese Medicine Researchers: Prof. Alan Bensoussan, A/Prof. Dennis Chang Partner/Funding Body: NSW Department of State and Regional Development, University of Western Sydney, University of Sydney Synergistic activity of herbal medicines in stroke Researchers: Prof. Kelvin Chan, Dr. Valentina Naumovski Strengthening Australia - China cooperation in research on plants for use in traditional Chinese medicine Researchers: Prof. Kelvin Chan, Prof. Alan Bensoussan, Prof. David Briggs, Shulin Chen, Murray Spicer Strengthening CompleMED's clinical trials platform through the Evado electronic data capture system, and analytical chemistry instrumentation required for herbal medicine definition.
