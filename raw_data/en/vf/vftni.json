PREFACE Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified is a detailed overview of the essential concepts involved in nursing care of the childbearing family with attention tothe client. Because the childbearing process may involve the father and siblingsin addition to the mother and newborn, nursing care should involve a family-cen-tered process. Chapter 1 provides an overview of pregnancy, major terminology,and issues that may arise with young or older pregnant females. Chapter 2 fo-cuses on family dynamics and community resources as well as issues related tocultural diversity. Chapter 3 focuses on the general health assessment that mayimpact the mother or newborn. Chapter 4 outlines contraception and discussesmajor problems that may occur prior to conception, including infertility andsexually transmitted disease. Chapters that address each stage of pregnancy andbirth, in addition to the newborn period, follow with a systematic review of ill-nesses and conditions that may be encountered in each stage or period. This book is an easy to understand presentation of concepts and focuses on the information that students most need to understand the conditions thatmost commonly face the childbearing family. This review focuses on the mostcritical information in maternal-newborn nursing by discussing the underly-ing factors involved in maintaining or restoring the health and well-being ofthe expectant mother and newborn, and those factors that threaten that well-being.

Maternal-newborn nursing focuses on the experience and care of a woman, family, and newborn before, during, and after a pregnancy. Care forthe woman of childbearing age may begin prior to conception with planningfor pregnancy and addressing issues related to fertility. A family-centeredapproach is essential to ensure that the primary needs of the childbearingwoman and the newborn are fully addressed. The family provides the sourceof support and resources for the mother and child; thus the stability, or lack ofstability, of the family can greatly impact the maternal-child experiencebefore, during, and after pregnancy. The cultural background of the familyalso greatly impacts the experience of pregnancy and childbirth. Culturalnorms should be respected and, when possible, integrated into the plan of carefor the childbearing family. The nurse's role in the care of the childbearing family can vary depending on the stage of the woman and family in the childbearing process. Prior toconception, the role of the nurse may be focused on assisting the woman andmate with family planning or addressing fertility issues. After conception andthrough delivery, the nurse is focused on supporting a healthy pregnancythrough health promotion measures including proper nutrition, rest, and activ-ity to benefit the mother and fetus. The nurse may work with the family inthe following capacities. /H17035 Licensed practical/licensed vocational nurse (LPN/LVN ):A technical nurse who has completed a program in a technical school orcommunity college setting and passed the National Council LicensureExamination (NCLEX) for LPN/LVNs. The LPN/LVN may assist in aclinic, in a doctor's office, or in the hospital setting, often under thedirection of a licensed registered nurse, nurse practitioner, or physician,and may assist with preparation of the childbearing female for the preg-nancy and delivery process. /H17035Registered nurse (RN): A professional nurse who has graduated from an accredited nursing program and passed the NCLEX for RNs. TheRN may plan and provide care for the childbearing family from initialcontact, beginning with gathering of assessment data and providingteaching, to monitoring the progression of the pregnancy through deliv-ery, and assisting the new family in the adjustment process with thenewborn. /H17035Nurse practioner (NP): An advanced practice nurse who provides care to the childbearing family beginning with diagnosis and addressing offertility issues with referral to appropriate specialists as needed, throughdelivery of the newborn and care of the neonate, and the postdeliverycare for the new mother and family, including lactation guidance. TheNP may specialize in women's health; family (FNP), focusing on allmembers of a family from birth to old age; the neonate (NNP), caring forthe normal or high-risk newborn; or the pediatric client as the newborngrows (PNP).21Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 4 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 1 / Overview of Maternity Nursing 5 /H17035Certified nurse-midwife (CNM): An advanced practice nurse who is often educated at the master's level and has passed a certification test inthe area of pregnancy and labor-delivery. The CNM provides care for thechildbearing woman during pregnancy and through labor and delivery. /H17035Clinical nurse specialist (CNS): An RN who has obtained advanced education and clinical preparation at the master's level with a focus onthe educator, manager, and researcher roles relative to patient care. TheCNS may provide care to the childbearing family during the family plan-ning phase, and through pregnancy and delivery, care of the newbornand postdelivery mother and family, and post discharge during theadjustment period with the newborn, including issues with lactation andrefining parenting skills. THE NURSING PROCESS Nursing care is provided through the use of the nursing process, which provides a guide for comprehensive planning and provision of care to thechildbearing family. After years of practice, the steps of the process might notbe outlined distinctly as the nurse proceeds, but will remain the foundation forcare. The process includes: /H17035Assessment of the client and family relative to the problem and relatedconcerns, as well as underlying family dynamics that could impact sup-port and resources needed during the childbearing process. /H17035Development of nursing diagnoses, which are statements that define theproblems and potential problems indicated by the assessment findings.The North American Nurses Diagnosis Association International(NANDA-I: http://www.nanda.org) has established a list of standard diag-noses for use by nurses for planning and communication about client care. /H17035Determining the desired outcome of care and treatment\u2014generally res-olution, to the greatest degree possible, of the problem identified by thenursing diagnosis. Knowing the objective of the care, the desiredoutcome, helps to guide the activities needed and gives a basis for eval-uating the success of the care. /H17035Nursing interventions designed to help the client and family meet thedesired outcome of resolving the problem(s) from their condition. Inter-ventions include care to the client as well as client and family teaching.Continued monitoring and assessment is also an expected nursing inter-vention for comprehensive client care. /H17035Evaluation, and revision as indicated. This is the final stage of the nurs-ing process. Data are gathered and continued monitoring is used to deter-mine the degree to which outcomes were met and the need to revisegoals or interventions. New nursing diagnoses may be discovered, andold nursing diagnoses may be deleted after reviewing data from contin-ued monitoring and evaluation.3 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-newborn nursing encompasses several phases: /H17035Family planning phase: Involves the childbearing female from pubes- cence, with information on menstruation and avoidance of unwantedteen pregnancy, through addressing issues with infertility and prepara-tion for conception and a health pregnancy /H17035Antipartum phase: The period from conception until the beginning of labor /H17035Intrapartum phase: The labor stages through the delivery of the newborn and placenta /H17035Postpartum phase (puerperium): The stage after delivery of the placenta through 6 weeks following delivery FAMILY PLANNING The focus in family planning is to promote optimal well-being of the child-bearing family including the health of the mother from conception throughdelivery, the safe and healthy delivery of a healthy newborn, or care of thehigh-risk newborn if indicated, and the establishment of a stable new familyunit. Issues related to contraception, fertility, and other prepregnancy con- cerns are discussed in a later chapter. The growth and development stage of the childbearing female greatly impacts the issues of conception being addressed in this stage. Of particularconcern are pregnancy at a young age and pregnancy after the age of 40, bothof which can increase the risk of complications. CHILD OR ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY Although the adolescent female is of childbearing age, the focus of nursingintervention at this time is frequently on prevention of unwanted pregnancyor comprehensive care in the case of teen pregnancy. Knowledge and con-sideration of a child's developmental stage can contribute to planning ofage-appropriate care, particularly during pregnancy. Recognition that thestress of pregnancy can impact the child's growth and development allowsthe nurse to anticipate developmental disruption or regressions and plan careaccordingly. Potential Concerns /H17035Risky behaviors, encouraged by peer pressure, i.e., violence, homicide,reckless driving, excessive and unprotected sexual intercourse, smok-ing, and substance abuse present a danger to the mother and fetus inchild or adolescent pregnancy. /H17035Mental health problems including depression, suicide, and eating disor-ders can lead to adolescent or fetal mortality or morbidity. 554Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 6 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Family support may be limited in unwanted pregnancy; this may be exacerbated by poverty or family dysfunction prior to the addedstressor of teen pregnancy. Nutritional needs are increased for the pregnant adolescent. Adoles- cent development is incomplete, resulting in a higher need for nutri-ents and a competition between the mother and infant often resultingin premature births, underweight newborns, malnourished mothers,and higher infant mortality: /H17034Maternal intake determines the adequacy of fetal nutrition anddevelopment. Deficits for the mother result in deficits for the fetus. /H17034Nutritional intake of the adolescent is frequently lacking in suffi-cient amounts of iron, calcium, and folic acid, which are highlyimportant to developing muscles and bones and reproductive health. /H17034The teen diet is often deficient in vitamins A, D, B12and zinc; thus vitamin supplements are critical for the pregnant adolescent. /H17034Nutrition counseling should involve the teen, the expectant father,and the families of the mother and father to ensure that proper nutri-tion is supported before and after the baby is born.

Nurse Alert Teen nutritional intake is irregular; thus assessment of the teen's nutritional intake should be done over time and not involve just a 24-hour journal to determine eating habits. Teen pregnancy may be associated with other high-risk adolescent behaviors such as drinking and drug use; thus a thorough assessmentis needed and a plan of care should be developed to address anylifestyle habits that endanger the mother or fetus. Family dysfunction and abuse of the teen at home may place the ado- lescent mother at high risk for becoming an abusive parent or, at aminimum, establishing poor parenting skills. Implications for Nursing Care /H17035Effective interventions for teen clients must involve the teen in the plan-ning and implementation. /H17035All levels of development are important from physical to cognitive topsychosocial. /H17035Developmental stage theories are not specific for age, but include ageranges that may overlap. /H17035The stress of pregnancy and parenthood at a young age can cause rever-sal to a younger developmental stage for a brief period. /H17035Nursing measures, including client and family teaching, must considerthe developmental stage the child is demonstrating. /H17035Teach adolescents and family members strategies to reduce health-compromising behaviors and address peer pressure. /H17035Monitor for signs and plan interventions to address depression and sui-cidal ideation. /H17035Relate health-enhancing behaviors, such as nutritious eating, regularexercise, and driving safety with use of seat belts, to improved physicalappearance and promoting a healthy pregnancy and delivery. /H17035Assist the teen in planning an appropriate balance of activity and restduring pregnancy to minimize disruption of activities with peers. /H17035Provide opportunities for communication with the adolescent in theabsence of parents to allow asking of personal questions. /H17035Daily hygiene and treatment with acne medication can reduce outbreaks,with caution to avoid any substances that may be harmful to the fetus. /H17035Age-appropriate care and teaching can reduce stress that the pregnantchild or adolescent may experience during the growth and developmentprocess. /H17035Family interactions, or lack thereof, can impact growth and develop-ment and are particularly important to support a new adolescent motherin developing and sustaining good parenting skills.5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 8 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

PREGNANCY AFTER THE AGE OF 40 Increasing numbers of women, some of whom are career focused, are engaged in a second marriage, or have other life situations, decide to wait to conceiveand have a child. Modern health care has greatly improved the outcomes forthese women, with less mortality and morbidity resulting. However, pregnantwomen over the age of 40 may frequently be viewed as high risk, and mayexperience family disruption secondary to a mate who is unsupportive of theconcept of childrearing in later life, or older children who are unprepared toshare their parental support with a new sibling. Erikson's developmental stageof generativity versus self-absorption/stagnation indicates some behaviors thatmay be manifested by most women considering pregnancy or who are expec-tant mothers after the age of 40. For many women during this developmentalstage career has been a major focus and may have been the reason for thedelay in having children, but thoughts shift to caring for others and preparingthe next generation. The woman and childbearing family must deal with con-flicting demands, including fiscal needs for a two-person income or needs ofaging parents. While focused on the pregnancy the woman may also feel theneed to remain productive in her job, community, and other activities. Key issues in pregnancy after the age of 40 include the following: Difficulty conceiving with increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth Increased risk of complications during pregnancy, with higher risk in women with chronic illness or obesity Higher risk of developing diabetes secondary to pregnancy (gestational) Higher risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension Increased risk of developing preeclampsia (toxemia of pregnancy) Increased risk of requiring a caesarian section Increased risk of placenta previs Higher risk of delivering a child with a genetic/chromosomal abnor- mality, such as Down syndrome, possibly because the DNA in awoman's eggs is damaged over time (the risk rises as age increases) Developing a realistic plan for activity and rest during the pregnancy and balancing obligations during and after the adjustment periodwhen mother and newborn are discharged home, which promote ahealthy pregnancy and development of effective family managementand parenting skills Implications for Nursing Care /H17035Effective family planning is the first line of defense against potentialproblems. Educating the prospective mother/parents on the dangers ofpregnancy after 40 increases awareness of possible complications andallows for preparation and informed choices. /H17035Assessment of the woman's preconception state allows for targetedefforts to improve health, prior to attempts to become pregnant.5CHAPTER 1 / Overview of Maternity Nursing 9 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Family historyshould be examined to detect data that might indicate higher risk. /H17035Close monitoring after conception throughout the pregnancy allows forearly detection of problems and early intervention to minimize harm tothe fetus and protect the health of the mother.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 10 CONCLUSION Factors related to family and community can positively or negatively impact the care of the childbearing family. The nurse should deliver family-centeredcare to ensure that support systems are maximized and not disrupted so thatthe childbearing family receives needed support prior to and throughout thepregnancy and through their return to the home and community. Several keypoints should be noted from this overview chapter: 1. What is an accurate description of an advanced practice role in the care of the childbearing family? a. Licensed practical nurseb.

Provision of family-centered care will require the use of an organized nursing process to gather assessment data and plan age-appropriate inter-ventions for the childbearing family. 2. The nurse's role in the care of the childbearing family will vary based on the level of the nurse. The levels include licensed practical nurse, registerednurse, nurse practitioner (women's health, family, neonatal, or pediatric),certified nurse-midwife, or clinical nurse specialist. 3. Maternal-newborn nursing encompasses the family planning, antipartum, intrapartum, and postpartum/puerperium phases. 4. Family planning is focused on the optimal well-being of the childbearing family. 5. Performing family and community assessments is useful to identify con- tributing factors to possible problems with conception, support neededfor the childbearing family, and risk factors for problems during preg-nancy or after delivery. This assessment facilitates follow-up in the com-munity or home setting after discharge. 6. Support the childbearing family with particular considerations for the adolescent or younger, or the older mother. If the mother is a child oradolescent, or is over the age of 40, complications may result that willimpact the childbearing and childrearing process. 7. Nutritional assessment and support are important for a healthy pregnancy, particularly if the mother is a child or adolescent. 8. Pregnancy after 40 years of age can present physical and emotional chal- lenges for the childbearing family.CHAPTER 1 / Overview of Maternity Nursing 11 FINAL CHECKUP 1.

Health promotion, maintenance, and restoration activitiescan be supported or hindered by family dynamics and the presence or absenceof family and community support resources. Challenges presented by familyor community distress can severely limit the stability of the childbearing familyprior to, during, or after pregnancy and adjustment to parenthood. Understandingthe basic concepts of family and community dynamics helps the nurse to providecomprehensive care to a childbearing family. /H17035Foundational concepts Family-centered nursing recognizes family support as a needed factor for stability in the childbearing family. The family, in addition to the expectant mother, is supported throughout the childbearing experience. Collaboration with family is facilitated throughout hospital, community, and home care. Family advocacy includes enabling families to build on current strengths and helping them maintain a sense of control over their lives. In the home setting, the nurse is a visitor and should respect the authority of the family. Community support resources are crucial for childbearing families with special needs\u2014teen pregnancy, late pregnancy, or pregnancy withcomplications such as an expectant mother with illness or disability. /H17035Roles and relationships Family members often play more than one role in the family system. Family roles: /H17034Include but are not restricted to parent (mother, father, stepmother, step-father, foster parent), child, sibling, provider, homemaker, or caregiver. /H17034Vary depending on type and structure of the family, including number and age of members and ethnic-cultural background.1Maternal-Newborn Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 2 / Families and Communities 17 /H17034May change as a result of the pregnancy or the changes in the needs of the expectant mother\u2014the mother may be unable to work whenher income is essential to pay family bills. Pregnancy can causestress in a family and that stress can in turn result in the distress ofmother and fetus. TYPES OF FAMILIES Types of families may be described in different ways and needs may vary based on family composition and function. The types of childbearing familiesmay include: /H17035Nuclear family: Husband (usually the provider), wife (usually home- maker, though frequently works also), and child/children. /H17035Reconstituted/binuclear/blended family: Consists of a child or chil- dren and one parent in one home and another parent in a different home.A step-parent and step-siblings may be present in one or both homes,reconstituting two families into one and resulting in two blended nuclearfamilies. /H17035Cohabitation family: Consists of a man and woman who live together with a child or children without being married. /H17035Single-parent family: Consists of a man or woman living with one or more children. /H17035Gay/lesbian family: Two men or two women who live together as par- ents to one or more biological or adopted children. /H17035Extended family: Multigenerational groups consisting of parents and children with other relatives, i.e., grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins,grandchildren. NURSING IMPLICATIONS /H17035Perform a family assessment to determine the presence or absence ofsupport for the expectant mother and father during and afterhospitalization. /H17035Identify and collaborate with key individuals within the family unit topromote restoration and maintenance of stability for the childbearingfamily after the mother and newborn are discharged home. /H17035Involve parents and family in care activities with the newborn to pro-mote learning of after-discharge care. /H17035Assess the home environment and determine the presence of factors con-tributing to risk for the pregnant client or the newborn after dischargefrom the hospital. /H17035Collaborate with family members to minimize risk factors and preparethe home environment to meet the needs of the expectant mother priorto delivery and the mother and newborn following discharge.2 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Develop an action plan that addresses the needs of the childbearing family from admission through discharge back into the community andhome setting. SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS Social factors such as living environment and community relationships, in addition to economic factors such as poverty, unemployment, or homeless-ness, can impact the health and stability of the childbearing family due to lim-ited access to clean water, food, shelter, or health care. Some groups areconsidered high-risk populations \u2014groups of people at higher risk for ill- ness than the general population, due to social, economic, or cultural factors. Key social factors to be aware of include the following: /H17035Poverty may limit access to healthy food, leading to nutritional deficits. /H17035Lack of access to health care decreases health promotion and main-tenance and contributes to late diagnosis of illness and delayedtreatment. /H17035Unemployment contributes to poverty and possible homelessness,increasing exposure to overcrowded shelters, dangerous situations, andillness that may threaten the mother and fetus or newborn. /H17035High-risk behaviors such as unprotected sex, drugs, and reckless drivingcan lead to infections, addiction, and injury that increase infant andmaternal mortality and morbidity. /H17035Teen pregnancy can result in poor prenatal care, premature birth, andbirth defects, as well as poor parenting, leading to physiologic and psy-chological damage to the pediatric client. /H17035Family disruption due to factors such as drug or alcohol abuse, mentalillness, domestic violence, or divorce can destabilize the childbearingfamily, leading to distress. /H17035Community instability due to gang activity, crime, violence, high unem-ployment, and poverty can result in decreased available health resources. NURSING IMPLICATIONS /H17035Perform a community assessment to identify contributing factors to teenpregnancy, or risk factors for complications of pregnancy, such as com-municable diseases. /H17035Address community resource needs prior to discharge with follow-up inthe community or home setting after discharge. /H17035Work collaboratively with community agencies to provide comprehen-sive care to the childbearing family and facilitate follow-up assessmentand evaluations. 43Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 18 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

DIVERSITY ISSUES Diversity commonly relates to ethnic and cultural differences found in persons of varied races or religious beliefs. Knowledge of practices that are acceptableor preferred and those that are forbidden allows the nurse to plan care that isappropriate according to the client's ethnic and cultural background. The mosteffective process for determining appropriate care is to ask the client, family,or significant other about preferences and taboos. Many cultural preferencesand rituals do not conflict with medical care or pose harm to the expectantmother or fetus; however, some natural supplements may interact with med-ications or diet. Support of cultural norms can result in increased comfort anddecreased anxiety for the childbearing family. Some principles that should be considered when providing care to the child- bearing family from varied ethnic or cultural origin include the following: /H17035Cultural norms are communicated from generation to generation. /H17035Many cultures have strong beliefs related to conception, pregnancy,delivery, and postdelivery maternal and newborn care. These beliefsshould be honored whenever possible if no harm to mother or newbornis present. /H17035Clients from families that have first- or second-generation members whoimmigrated from a different culture are more likely to adhere to culturalrituals, while clients born in the United States or immigrating early inchildhood may be fully assimilated (acculturated), having adopted American customs, cultural norms, behaviors, and attitudes.5CHAPTER 2 / Families and Communities 19 1.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035For a subculture, a group within a culture that has different beliefs and values from that deemed typical for the culture, the nurse should noteindividualized preferences. /H17035Stereotyping is categorizing a group of people together, usually by race, rather than respecting individual characteristics. /H17035In some cultures, females should not be addressed directly but throughthe dominant male family member. /H17035Some cultures are matriarchal with the oldest female family memberaccepted as the decision maker. /H17035Older family members in some cultures are respected as the decisionmakers for the family. /H17035In some cultures, it is unacceptable to touch a woman without permis-sion, and only contact necessary for examination should be performed. /H17035Ethnocentric behavior (belief that one's own culture is best) can block communication with a client and family by decreasing trust and comfort. /H17035Communication in the native tongue may be needed for full understand-ing of client concerns. NURSING IMPLICATIONS Consider the following concepts when providing care to clients from differentethnic-cultural groups: Communication /H17035Assess the family interactions and relationships and consult with theexpectant mother, family member (include the pregnant child or adolescent)to determine preference relative to communication and the decision-making process between nurse and family members. /H17035Nurses should monitor their own behavior and avoid imposing culturalpreferences on the client. /H17035Provide an interpreter or use technology to assist in translation of con-cerns voiced in the client's native tongue. Physical touch /H17035Determine taboos related to physical contact and, if possible, avoidunacceptable touching by asking the clie nt or family to move the body part as the nurse performs the examination. /H17035When unacceptable touching is needed, explain the purpose and minimizecontact as much as possible. /H17035Use a sheet to cover the body, exposing only those areas being examined,and preserve the patient's modesty during the examination. /H17035If cross-gender touch is forbidden and a male nurse is assigned to providecare, enlist a female assistant to provide physical care while the nursemanages care. 6Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 20 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Diet and Rituals /H17035Ask the client and family about preferences because not all individuals from a cultural group practice the same rituals. /H17035Determine food preferences and relay information to a dietician to pro-mote offering of appropriate meal choices. /H17035Instruct family regarding dietary restrictions and needs, when indicated,secondary to pregnancy and allow them to supply desired foods if oth-erwise unavailable. /H17035Instruct family to notify the nurse regarding any foods or supplementsprovided to the client to avoid harmful drug-substance interaction orharm to the fetus. /H17035Consult family prior to removal of jewelry, bedside structures, or oint-ments from the client or the room to avoid disruption of religious or cul-tural ritual for luck or well-being.

Health assessment provides key informationneeded for determining a client's condition and for planning of effective careto assist the mother and newborn. The nurse will move from assessing theclient's and family's view of the pregnancy and any related problems througha client history, to assessing client support resources through a family/communityassessment. The nurse will then proceed to the physical examination andreview of diagnostic test results. Understanding the expected findings (normalranges) for the maternal-newborn population will assist the nurse in detectingabnormal findings. Assessment is used in initial contact with the childbearingfamily and throughout the course of the plan of care to evaluate the health ofthe mother and child throughout the pregnancy and newborn period. Infor-mation found during the assessment is used to refine the plan of care toincrease effectiveness and success in resolving or minimizing any problem(s)that occurs before, during, or after the pregnancy and newborn period. Thenursing process, as discussed in Chapter 1, serves as a guide for assessment,planning, and delivery of comprehensive care to the childbearing family. HEALTH ASSESSMENT: CLIENT HISTORY COMMUNICATION Communication is important when performing a health assessment. To provide family-centered care: /H17035All family members, including the father of the expected child and siblings,must be included in the assessment process because each perspective isneeded to gather complete data on the mother and newborn's condition.1Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified turgorStillbirthStriae gravidarum KEY TERMS Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 3 / Health Assessm ent of the Pediatric Client 27 /H17035Clear speech is necessary with the use of common terms instead of med- ical or nursing \"jargon\" that the client or family members may notunderstand. Nurse Alert If English is a second language for the client or family, an inter- preter may be needed to ensure that the questions asked and responses givenare understood. Communication in the client's native tongue may be needed for full understanding of client concerns. Key considerations when communicating during a health assessment include the following: /H17035By encouraging all family members to talk, nurses can identify informa-tion that affects all aspects of the expectant mother or the newborn's life. /H17035Interviewing both the expectant mother and father, and children, if appli-cable, involves more than just gathering facts; this initial contact estab-lishes the nature of future contacts and begins the development of atrusting relationship with the nurse. /H17035If the expectant mother and father are underage, involving their parentsis important to determine resources and support. Nurse Alert Legally an expectant mother, even if underage, has rights to privacy; thus, consent should be obtained prior to sharing any information about theexpectant mother with her parents or the expectant father or other significant others. /H17035Begin the interview with an introduction; explain the nurse's role and the purpose of the interview to establish a clear nurse-familyrelationship. /H17035Treat the expectant mother and father (in child/teen pregnancy includetheir parents) as partners equal to the nurse in the care process. /H17035When speaking with children in the family, use an interview process thatis appropriate for the child's developmental stage, including: Use play with dolls or puppets; role-playing may ease the anxiety of the interview process. Get at eye level with children and actively engage them through play and verbal exchange. Nurse Alert Be aware of cultural variation in eye contact, as direct eye contact might be considered disrespectful or evil. 1 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Treat the adolescent appropriately, neither as a child nor an adult. Find time without parents present to allow adolescents to ask ques-tions or state concerns they may be embarrassed to discuss aroundparents. /H17035Touch is a powerful communication tool, especially for the infant whocalms when cuddled or patted, or a parent who is distraught about achild's condition. Nurse Alert Be aware of cultural variation in physical contact, particularly across genders, which might be considered inappropriate or taboo. /H17035Provide an interpreter or use technology to assist in the translation of questions and of responses voiced in the client's native tongue. /H17035Remember that nonverbal communication is as important as verbal.Smiling and maintaining a pleasant facial expression reduces client andparent anxiety. /H17035Attitude is also important in establishing a trust relationship with theclient. /H17035 Maintaining a non-judgmental manner will help the expectant mother feel comfortable providing truthful information to the nurse. NURSING HISTORY Discuss or have the client complete a form containing the following informa-tion to provide contact data and clarify concerns:Demographic data: /H17035Biographical information: Name of mother and expectant father. Marital status. Age of both parents, or newborn age and term of pregnancy. Address/phone number(s) and other contact information. Include demographic data on the expectant mother's parents with teen/ado-lescent pregnancy. Race. Occupation. Economic status. Education level (current grade and school for adolescent). Living situation. Religion. Past history provides background for the problem and any additional problems that the mother or newborn may have experienced. This assessment shouldinclude acute or chronic conditions, as well as surgical procedures. 1Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 28 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Eating habits: Frequency and type of food intake can reveal inadequate diet or excessive intake, eating disorders, obesity, or malnutrition (failureto thrive in infant population), possibly due to poverty, or it could revealabuse or neglect. /H17035Substance abuse: Drugs, tobacco, or alcohol (current or past) by expec-tant mother; determine frequency and amount or usage\u2014could endangerthe life of the mother and fetus and result in birth defects. /H17035Sexual activity and number of partners (do not limit assessment to olderadolescents because a child as young as 8 or 9 may be sexually active):Increases risk of infections that may result in birth defects or premature birth. /H17035Expectant mother's (and father's, if available) acceptance and perspec-tive on pregnancy: Determines if she is happy or distressed about thepregnancy. /H17035History of abuse (child abuse, spousal abuse). /H17035Plans for child post birth. NUTRITIONAL ASSESSMENT An essential element in the assessment is an evaluation of the mother's ornewborn's nutritional status from a physical examination and a biochemicalperspective, as well as the usual dietary intake. It is important to collect dataregarding nutrition habits. /H17035Inquire about community access to a variety of food types and factorsimpacting food choices, such as location of stores, fast-food choices dueto time constraints, and economic barriers to purchase sufficient quan-tities of fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat cuts of meat, as well asfish and fowl choices. /H17035If the family practices vegetarianism, inquire about the specific foodsallowed and assess the adequacy of the intake of nutrients from all foodgroups. /H17035Assess whether the expectant mother is overweight (85-95% for body mass index [BMI]) or obese (weight above the 95% for BMI). /H17035Assess family members because family eating habits will play a large part in the eating habits of the expectant mother. Nurse Alert Assess dietary restrictions due to ethnic cultural beliefs and taboos. Nutritional assessment should include: /H17035Maternal dietary intake: Dietary history by 24-hour recall, food diary, or record to note the nature and amount of foods and beverages consumed (use longerassessment time for pregnant adolescent).2Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 30 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 3 / Health Assessm ent of the Pediatric Client 31 /H17035Newborn dietary intake: Determine if breast-fed and how often and how long the newborn feeds. If newborn is bottle-fed or bottle supplements are provided, identify the type of formula and the amount of formula consumed and how often. /H17035 Clinical examination: Chart weight, height/length, and head circumference (for newborn) on a growth chart: If the newborn is below the 5th percentile (lowbirth weight) or above the 95th percentile, an insufficient or excessintake, respectively, is likely present. Calculate body mass index (BMI): Weight in kilograms divided by height in meters 2. Delay of development of secondary sex characteristics (i.e., breasts and pubic hair), which can indicate malnutrition, or vitamin A andD deficiency or excess. Skin changes such as loss of skin turgor (elasticity of the skin) or edema (swelling or puffiness), indicating dehydration or fluid over- load (preeclampsia). Delayed wound healing (poor protein intake/malnutrition). Flabby skin or stretch marks can indicate food excesses (other than that expected with pregnancy). Other physical changes noting malnourishment or excess dietary intake should be included in the physical assessment. BIOCHEMICAL TESTS A general blood analysis of nutrients, electrolytes, and protein products shouldbe performed. /H17035Hemoglobin and hematocrit: Low levels may reveal inadequate proteinintake. /H17035Albumen, protein, creatinine, nitrogen: Low levels could indicate lowprotein intake. /H17035Glucose: Negative is normal in urine; blood glucose should be less than100 mg. /H17035Tissue from hair, nails, bone, and organs can reveal nutritional deficitsor excess chemical elements. /H17035Urinalysis can reveal excess glucose or other electrolytes, as well as pro-tein loss from renal damage that could indicate a risk for protein deficit. An economic assessment could indicate a financial deficit that limits the ability to buy food, indicating a need for assistance from social services. FAMILY HISTORY AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS Questions about family history include items such as whether certain dis-eases/conditions run in the family, the age and cause of death for blood rela-tives (to detect possible genetic conditions), and family members withcommunicable diseases (to detect possible infection or infestation).2 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

FAMILY ASSESSMENT Family assessment is an important aspect of the history because the emotional and physical health of the child or adolescent is dependent on the stability of the family structure and function. There are various definitions for the term family, which broadly means one or more adults living with one or more children in aparent-child relationship. Family also refers to those individuals who are impor-tant to the core or nuclear group. Family assessment involves exploration of fam-ily structure and composition as well as member relationships, characteristics,interactions, and dynamics. If the expectant mother or father is experiencing amajor stressor, such as parental divorce, chronic illness, or death of a familymember, or issues such as behavioral or physical problems, or developmentaldelays that suggest family dysfunction are noted, an in-depth family assessmentis indicated. In performing this assessment consider the following:Structure: /H17035The number and composition of family members can determine theamount of support available to the child/adolescent during the healthchallenge. /H17035Questions should be open enough to encompass various family struc-tures, such as, \"What are the names of the newborn's parent(s)?\" insteadof asking about \"husband or wife.\" /H17035Inquire about all persons living in the household or households in whichthe mother or newborn resides at any time, and their relationships to themother/newborn and family, to provide a full picture of the family struc-ture or multiple family structures the child is exposed to. /H17035Ask about extended family and additional support, such as from friendsor church members, to determine the extent of resources available to thechild and family. /H17035Inquire about family illness or deaths, previous separations, anddivorces, and the child's response to these events to determine the use ofprevious coping skills. /H17035A genogram, a diagram of the family composition and structure, can behelpful in viewing the family structure comprehensively. The core unitis circled and connections of other members of the family to this core areclearly indicated (Fig. 3.1). FAMILY FUNCTION Family function assessment is focused on how members interact with oneanother. Several tests may be used to assess family function. A picture ofthe family from the child's perspective can be enlightening about thefamily relationships, as well as observation of the family interactions. Theimportant aspects of this assessment are the determination of the family'sability to:3Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 32 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION A systematic approach to the physical examination, proceeding from head to toe, is the best method of fully assessing a client. For the newborn, however, intrusive procedures such as ear, eye, nose, and mouth examinations should be done last to keep the child calm for as long as possible during the physicalexamination. For the expectant mother, the examination of the abdominal areaand uterus should be detailed to determine the progression of the pregnancyand possible complications. Normal findings for examination of most systemswill vary for the expectant or postdelivery female depending on the stage ofpregnancy or period postdelivery. Normal findings for the newborn will varydepending on time since birth and age (prematurity). GENERAL /H17035Overall appearance reveals cleanliness, good nourishment. /H17035Mother's clothes are well-fitting, stature is appropriate for her age, postureis straight, no signs of pain (frown/grimace). /H17035Behavior and personality, interactions with significant others and nurse,temperament (behavioral style; calmness or lack thereof). Nurse Alert If the newborn is agitated, some assessments will need to be deferred until the newborn is more cooperative and calm to minimize distress. SKIN /H17035Integrity (absence of lesions, drainage, etc.). /H17035Color: Pallor (pale appearance) or cyanosis (bluish tinge) could indicate poor circulation or oxygenation; flushing could indicate increased bloodflow to the skin due to infection. /H17035Texture, dryness or moisture, temperature, hair growth or lack thereofcould indicate fluid or nutritional deficits. /H17035Blanching/capillary refill (pallor followed by return of flush after pressure; if this happens in less than 3 seconds it indicates circulatory adequacy). /H17035Birth-marks or other skin color deviations (non-pathological) may benoted. /H17035Ecchymosis (blue/black areas or bruises often from trauma) or abrasions (indicating trauma, accidental or intentional), or petechiae , small pinpoint hemorrhages, could indicate a bleeding disorder due to lack of platelets. HAIR /H17035Note color, distribution, quality, texture, elasticity, and cleanliness. Culturalvariations in coarseness or curliness of hair may be noted, but hair andscalp should be clean without lesions.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 34 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Dry, thin, brittle hair, or hair loss can indicate nutritional deficits or be a side effect from medication/cancer treatment. Premature newborn mayhave thin hair over body (lanugo). /H17035Unusual hair distribution on face, arms, trunk, or legs could indicatepathology. /H17035Presence or absence of hair in underarm or pubic regions could indicatepremature or delayed pubertal changes or hormonal dysfunction. Bald-ing in an infant could suggest a need for more frequent position changesfor sleep, although shedding of hair is expected for a newborn. /H17035Inspect for scalp itching, which could indicate seborrhea, ringworm, orscalp infection or infestation, i.e., lice (gray flakes from nits/ova adheringto hair, particularly in child/teen pregnancy due to exposure to otherchildren). Nurse alert Use gloves or tongue blade during inspection for lice to avoid self- infestation. Also check scalp for ticks (smooth, oval, grey or brown bodies). NAILS /H17035Should be smooth and flexible. /H17035If dry and brittle, or ridges are noted, nutritional deficits may be present. /H17035Clubbed (bulged and slightly cyanotic) fingertips may indicate respira-tory or cardiac dysfunction. HEAD AND NECK /H17035Head control is absent in the newborn. /H17035Head shape and symmetry: Some molding (head is elongated due to overriding of head sutures) is noted after a vaginal birth. Report extremeasymmetry for further evaluation\u2014flattening on one side could indicatelack of position changes. /H17035Fontanels should be open about 4-5 cm at the widest point (anterior)and 0.5-1 cm at the widest point (posterior). Report closed or narrowfontanels, or any pressure noted. /H17035Note reports of headaches, swollen neck glands, neck stiffness, ordecreased range of motion. Nurse alert Nuchal rigidity\u2014pain with neck flexion or hyperextension of head\u2014may indicate meningeal irritation and possible meningitis (more com- mon with adult than newborn). /H17035Report any shift in trachea (possible lung problem), or mass in the neck.

EYES AND VISION /H17035Note size, symmetry, color, and movement of eyes, as well as exterior structures and spacing between the eyes; report deviations from expectedstraight palpebral fissures (upward slant normally noted in Asian clients).Down syndrome may be characterized by epicanthal folds, upwardpalpebral slant, and hypertelorism (large spacing between eyes). /H17035Eyelids should be smooth without drooping or malposition; note blink reflex. /H17035Examine pupil for roundness, equal size, reactivity to light, accommo-dation, and size, color, and clarity of iris (black and white speckling isseen in Down syndrome). /H17035The lens of the eye is normally not visible; white or gray spots couldindicate cataracts. /H17035Report unusual eye movement, strabismus (often normal in newborn),excessively crossed eye. EARS AND HEARING /H17035Inspect external ear structures for alignment, general hygiene, presenceand amount of wax (can view partially without otoscope). /H17035Newborn may respond to human voice but should react to loud noise bydemonstrating a startle (Moro) reflex and blink (acoustic) reflex. Nurse Alert Gently restrain newborn during otoscope use to avoid injury. /H17035Pull pinna of the ear down and back for infants and up and back for adult to straighten the ear canal and visualize the inner ear structures. /H17035Auditory testing should be appropriate to age, ranging from a loud noiseto elicit a startle reflex in the newborn to the use of audiometry for detec-tion of the type and degree of hearing loss, if present in a child, adoles-cent, or adult. MOUTH, THROAT, NOSE, SINUSES, AND NECK /H17035History can reveal high-risk circumstances: Frequent oral lesions, dentalproblems, or nosebleeds require in-depth examination of the mother. /H17035Report any flaring of the nostrils in newborn, which could indicaterespiratory distress. /H17035Note any bleeding, swelling, discharge, dryness, or blockage of nasalpassages, which could indicate trauma, irritation, or infection such as acold. /H17035Mouth and throat may reveal lesions of the mouth or lips, redness, ordrainage indicating infection. Congenital conditions such as cleft lip orpalate may be noted.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 36 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Fissures, stomatitis, or glossitis may indicate fluid and nutritional deficits. /H17035White patches in a newborn may indicate candidiasis, while herpes simplex or syphilitic chancre may be noted if the mother is an adult,adolescent, or child. /H17035Tonsil enlargement, redness, white patches, or drainage in the throatcould indicate tonsillitis or pharyngitis. /H17035Inspect the teeth of the mother for dental caries, which could indicatepoor hygiene and nutritional deficits, and also note malocclusion (poorbiting relationship of teeth and poor tooth alignment), which could resultin feeding problems, and loss of teeth and self-image problems. /H17035Palpate head and neck for lymph nodes and report swollen, tender, orwarm nodes that may indicate the presence of infection. CHEST Heart, Neck Vessels, Pulses, and Blood Pressure /H17035Chest shape, symmetry, and movement should be noted. Report signifi- cant retraction of chest muscles, which could indicate respiratory distress. /H17035Note nipples for symmetry, discharge, masses, or lesions. Breast devel-opment usually occurs from 10-14 years, and engorgement is noted dur-ing pregnancy and the immediate postdelivery period, or beyond ifbreast-feeding. /H17035Listen to the heart with the mother in sitting and in supine position; noteheart murmurs and record the location and volume intensity. Examinethe newborn in supine position (an innocent murmur\u2014systolic, shortduration without transmission to other areas\u2014may be noted in the new-born but should be recorded). /H17035Note history of congenital heart disease or hypertension. /H17035Neck vein distention could indicate congestive heart failure. /H17035Report if mother reports experiencing chest pain, or if newborn becomesfatigued or short of breath during feeding, as these are signs of decreasedcirculation or cardiac function. /H17035Resting pulse rates according to the age of the child: Newborn: Pulse rate 100-160, up to 200 beats/minute if agitated 10 years-adulthood: 55-90 beats/minute /H17035Blood pressure also varies according to age (systolic age + 90/diastolic) but is rarely done in a well newborn. Average blood pressure for mother: 11-18 years and older: 120/80 mm Hg Lungs and Respiration /H17035Breath sounds should be clear; voice sounds should be heard throughthe lungs but syllables should be indistinct (vocal resonance). Syllablesclearly heard when whispered ( pectoriloquy) , sound increased in intensity or clarity (bronchophony), diminished or absent vocal resonance, orCHAPTER 3 / Health Assessm ent of the Pediatric Client 37 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Breath soundsin the newborn may reveal hyper-resonance with loud and more intensesound since the chest wall is thin and sound is not muffled. /H17035Respiratory rates palpation or percussion of the abdomen toavoid altering current bowel sound pattern with artificial stimulation ofbowel activity. /H17035Gently palpate abdomen; do not palpate abdomen if Wilms tumor is present. /H17035Note shape of abdomen: Newborn abdomen is prominent with umbilicusevident and moist initially\u2014note color, moisture, and drainage, if present.Remnant of the umbilicus should be dry within days of birth. /H17035Examine all four quadrants of the abdomen. /H17035Report visible peristaltic waves, which may indicate pathologic state. /H17035Note absence of or asymmetrical abdominal reflex in newborn. /H17035Watch for increased intra-abdominal pressure from newborn cry andinspect for hernia in abdomen. /H17035Separation of abdominal muscle ( diastasis recti ) may be noted in the newborn due to immature muscles. Monitor for abdominal hernia (morecommon in African American newborn). /H17035Report hyperperistalsis, indicated by hyperactive bowel sounds, or an absenceof bowel sounds, both of which may indicate a gastrointestinal disorder. /H17035Lack of tympany on percussion could indicate full stomach, or presenceof fluid or solid tumor; avoid assessment of stomach immediately aftermeals. /H17035Note guarding and tenderness, particularly rebound tenderness or pain,which could indicate inflammation or infection. GENITOURINARY /H17035Examination can be anxiety provoking for child and adolescent mothers;thus, secure privacy (ask mother's preference for parental or other significantother's presence), preserve modesty, and when possible offer same-sexexaminer. /H17035If client complains of burning, frequency, or difficulty voiding, obtainurine specimen for possible culture.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 38 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Answer:ROUTINE CHECKUP 2 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES When preparing the client and family for diagnostic procedures, explain things as simply as possible and remain concrete and avoid abstractions. Be veryclear about what the client needs to do (hold still, turn on side, etc.). Give thechild/adolescent choices and control whenever possible in assisting duringthe diagnostic procedure. LABORATORY TESTS Diagnostic findings, particularly biochemical tests, often vary based on theage of the client. The greatest age-related difference in test results is notedbetween those of the newborn and those of children above the age of 12 toadulthood. Lab values should be interpreted with consideration for client age.The following are examples of tests that may be performed: Biochemical Tests Pregnancy-specific tests may be performed from preconception tests to detectpossible problems or complications to the pregnancy test. /H17035ABO blood typing and Rh factor determination (it's best for this to bedone for both the expectant mother and father): If mother and fetus havedifferent blood or Rh factor types a reaction can occur that can causefetal and maternal death. /H17035First trimester aneuploidy screening: To detect abnormal chromosomecondition. /H17035Serology test for syphilis to initiate treatment prior to conception if possible.4 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CONCLUSION Factors related to family and community can positively or negatively impact the care of the childbearing family. The nurse should deliver family-centeredcare to ensure that support systems are maximized and not disrupted so that theclient receives needed support throughout the illness and return to the home andcommunity. Several key points should be noted from this overview chapter. 1. Provision of family-centered care will require the use of an organized nursing process to gather assessment data and plan age-appropriate inter-ventions for the childbearing family. 2. Communication is critical to obtain information from and relay infor- mation to the childbearing family in the process of assessing andplanning for client care; the family knows more about the client andtheir information should be valued. 3. Cultural and ethnic differences and preferences should be considered and accommodated when possible during the nursing care process. 4. History assessment is important to determine exposures and chronic conditions, as well as habits that may influence a client's health status. 5. Nutritional assessment and support is important to maintain and restore the health status of a child, adolescent, or adult going through pregnancy,or for the newborn. 6. Family assessment is important to determine support for the childbear- ing family during and after a pregnancy and adjustment to a newborn. 7.

Blood pressure, pulse, and respirations vary with age; consider normal based on the average value for age. 9. Assessment procedures may need to be altered depending on the age and condition of the client, such as light palpation only if a Wilms tumoris suspected, to avoid injury to the client. 10. Involve the client and family in the assessment and diagnostic proce- dures with a clear explanation of expected assistance. 11. Clearly explain what will be felt, seen, heard, or smelled by the client in preparation for a procedure. 12. Normal diagnostic findings and values should be interpreted based on the age of the client to determine what is truly abnormal. 13. Assess for pregnancy prior to X-ray or scans with dye.14. Assess for allergy to seafood, shellfish, or iodine since some procedures may require contrast dye that contains iodine.CHAPTER 3 / Health Assessm ent of the Pediatric Client 45 FINAL CHECKUP 1.

PRE-PREGNANCY PREPARATION Prior to pregnancy, the mother and father might be counseled to avoid lifestyle behaviors and exposure to circumstances or elements that mightprevent pregnancy or result in harm or possibly death to the unborn child.Areas that should be considered include the following: NUTRITION /H17035Malnutrition can inhibit menstruation, which can prevent pregnancy. /H17035A lack of folic acid in the maternal diet can lead to damage to the grow-ing fetus, such as a neural tube defect like spina bifida. /H17035A paternal diet low in vitamin C has been associated with risk of birthdefects and cancer. AGE As stated earlier, younger and older mothers may experience greater pregnancydifficulty or newborn complications. /H17035Increased infant mortality and premature births have been associatedwith adolescent pregnancy. /H17035Older paternal age has been associated with birth defects related tochromosomal damage, including Down syndrome. 21,21 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. SUBSTANCE ABUSE /H17035Nicotine: Smoking has been associated with low birth weight, as well as risk for cancer. /H17035Caffeine has been associated with low birth weight and preterm delivery. /H17035 Alcohol: Excessive use of alcohol by the female during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which includes facial, limb,and organ abnormalities, in addition to mental retardation. Additionally,moderate use of alcohol during pregnancy has been associated withdecreased mental development in infants/children, adolescent alcoholuse, and depression or anxiety as the child grows. /H17035Marijuana: Use by the father has been shown in some studies to reducetestosterone levels and sperm count, which may contribute to infertility.Use by the female has been associated with neurological damage resultingin tremors in newborns, and poor verbal skills and memory development. /H17035Cocaine: Use by the female could result in reduced birth weight andimpaired mental and motor development, and use by the male mayimpact sperm and result in birth defects. /H17035Heroin: Use by the female can result in addiction of the infant and with-drawal symptoms including irritability, disturbed sleep, and poor motorcontrol. TOXIN EXPOSURE /H17035Some prescription and over-the-counter medications and other substancesare teratogens \u2014agents that cause fetal deformities and birth defects. /H17035Some teratogens are known and others are unknown; therefore, women of childbearing age who are attempting to become pregnant are encour-aged to avoid medications without permission from their doctor, partic-ularly during the first 3 months of pregnancy when development of bodystructures and organs are most sensitive to deformity. /H17035Maternal exposure to chemicals, radiation, pollutants, and toxic waste,including lead, mercury, or carbon monoxide, can result in visual, men-tal, or other defects. Exposure by a male to environmental hazards suchas lead, radiation, pesticides, or other chemicals has been associated withabnormal sperm, which contributes to spontaneous abortion and condi-tions such as chromosomal abnormalities and childhood cancer. Family planning includes instructing potential mothers and fathers to avoid habits that might reduce the chance of pregnancy or might result in damageto the infant or contribute to a difficult pregnancy. CONCEPTION To understand the complications that can occur before or during a preg- nancy, the usual process of pregnancy from beginning to end should be under-stood. In order for pregnancy to occur, ovulation , the release of an egg from the3222CHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 53 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Ovulation generally occurs 2 weeks before the menstrual period begins. The process of conception involves the union of a woman's ovum/egg with a man's sperm, also referred to as fertilization . Each parent contributes 23 chromosomes (genetic structures that contain informationabout characteristics) to the resulting child, who will have 23 pairs or a total of46 chromosomes in each body cell. The genetic information in the chromo-somes is found in a substance called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The cells ofthe body are reproduced resulting in growth of the fertilized egg into a mass ofcell. The fertilized egg is called a zygote , and the first 2 weeks after conception are called the germinal period, during whic h the cells continue to duplicate and move. This process begins in the woman's fallopian tube and the zygotemoves to the uterus, where it implants into the uterine wall. Two to eight weeks after conception, the embryonic period occurs in which: /H17035The cells of the zygote multiply and differentiate to form the tissues andorgans of the body, becoming an embryo . /H17035The embryo's attachment to the uterine wall changes as layers, includ- ing the placenta, the umbilical cord, and the amnion, are formed. /H17035The placenta provides a mass of blood vessels from the mother and theembryo, across which oxygen and nutrients pass from the mother to theembryo and waste and carbon dioxide pass from the embryo to the mother. /H17035The umbilical cord, which contains 2 arteries and 1 vein, serves as a connec-tion from the embryo to the placenta to allow blood flow from mother to child. /H17035The amnion is the sac in which the embryo will lie throughout the pregnancy. The fluid within the sac is produced by the embryo's kidneys,and as development continues this fl uid is produced by th e lungs as well. /H17035During the embryonic period, organ systems and body parts take shape. The final period, the fetal period, begins 2 months after conception and continues through birth. /H17035The embryo is considered a fetus and proceeds to grow dynamically. /H17035Genitalia can be distinguished and gender can be identified. /H17035Increased movement of limbs and mouth is noted along with the gain-ing of length and weight. TESTING Pregnancy testing can be performed through blood or urine testing for thepresence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a substance secreted duringpregnancy. Blood testing is the most accurate and can assist in determining theduration of the pregnancy. The level of hCG increases each day of pregnancy;thus, the higher the amount of hCG, the longer the female has been pregnant.Blood testing is most often done in a laboratory facility. Urine tests can be purchased and used in a home setting. These tests can be accurate; however, different products are sensitive to different levels(25 mIU/mL or higher) of hCG. In early pregnancy a test that is only sensitive3Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 54 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. to high levels of hCG might inaccurately indicate the woman is not pregnant when in fact the woman is. False-positive testing is less likely, unless medica-tion being taken influences the test. If the test indicates the woman is pregnant,a follow-up test should be done in a doctor's office or other health care facil-ity. Basic principles in pregnancy testing with urine include the following: /H17035Reading the instructions prior to testing /H17035Understanding the sensitivity of the test /H17035Using first morning urine or refraining from urinating for at least 4 hoursprior to voiding for the test /H17035Avoiding drinking large amounts of fluid prior to testing since it candilute the hCG in the urine and decrease test sensitivity to the hCG /H17035Reading the test package for medications that may impact the test results,and seeking medical testing for accuracy if indicated Monitoring of hCG levels can indicate how well a pregnancy is progressing. If hCG levels are not increasing over time, the pregnancy might be endangeredor have spontaneously terminated. Routine blood tests may be performed todetermine the health of the mother, including blood levels through hematocritand hemoglobin, electrolyte balance through potassium and sodium levels, orkidney function through blood urea nitrogen (BUN). If indicated, other systemfunctions may be evaluated, such as blood gases if respiratory concerns arise.CHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 55 1.

Family planning involves the prevention of preg- nancy until the desired time. Varied measures may be used to prevent fertil- ization of a woman's egg. Abstinence, or refraining from sexual intercourse,is the only 100% method of avoiding accidental pregnancy. Added benefits ofabstinence include the decreased risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).Other measures include nonprescription or prescription measures. Measuresthat involve barriers to sperm may also reduce the risk of STD transmission. Nonprescriptive measures include measures to block the sperm from reach- ing the egg. These measures can include the following: /H17035Withdrawal of the penis prior to ejaculation to prevent introduction of sperminto the vagina. This measure has no cost; however, reliability is limitedsince leakage can occur prior to ejaculation being sensed by the male. /H17035Rhythm method, which involves abstaining from sex during times offertility. This measure is inexpensive, but requires accurate monitoringof the menstrual cycle, which can be irregular in adolescence, makingmonitoring difficult. /H17035Condom to contain sperm (male) or block entry into the cervix (female)has low expense and provides protection against sexually transmitteddisease, but may be difficult to apply (female). Condoms are readilyavailable in stores but may be embarrassing to purchase, and condombreakage can occur. /H17035Spermicide: Serves as a chemical barrier to kill sperm prior to entry intothe uterus. Spermicide is available in stores but may cause skin irritation. /H17035Diaphragm (a rubber cap lined with spermicide placed over the cervix)is used to block and kill sperm trying to enter the uterus. Use of adiaphragm may require a visit to a health care provider for fitting. Thefemale must remember to apply it and must feel comfortable applyingit before sexual intercourse. Use increases the risk of urinary tract infec-tions and slippage of the diaphragm reduces effectiveness. Some methods of contraception require a prescription and close monitor- ing to prevent complications. The risk of harm or injury must be comparedwith the benefit of pregnancy prevention prior to choosing to use these meas-ures. Generally, the risk and expense are higher with prescription contracep-tives. These measures may include the following: /H17035Oral contraceptive wall. The effectivenessis higher than nonprescription measures but hormonal changes canincrease the risk of complications. This measure is expensive andrequires medical monitoring; in addition, in some individuals \"the pill\"can increase the risk of cancer. Other risk factors for cancer, such asnicotine use, should be avoided if taking oral contraceptives.

It requires a health care provider visit. Com-plications may include weight gain, decreased libido, and decreasedbone density. /H17035Progestin and estrogen combination injection is provided monthly toprevent ovulation, thicken the mucus of the cervix, and thin the endometrialwall. It must be taken monthly, and nausea or tenderness of the breastsmay be experienced. Nurse Alert History is critical with this therapy because if more than 33 days have lapsed since the last progestin and estrogen combination injection, a pregnancytest must be done prior to giving the injection to prevent unintended fetal damage in case of an unknown pregnancy. /H17035Norplant (levonorgestrel) implant is inserted beneath the skin of the upper arm to prevent ovulation, thicken cervical mucus, and thin theendometrial wall. Insertion and removal requires a medical visit, and itmay be expensive to use. Weight gain may be noted with altered bleed-ing patterns. /H17035Intrauterine device (IUD) blocks the sperm from contact with the eggand prevents implantation. If progestin is added, hormonal effects ofthickening of the uterine wall and thinning of the endometrial wall arealso noted. No systemic effects are noted, but the IUD may dislodge andbe expelled; a medical visit is required. Irregular menstrual patterns maybe noted with dysmenorrhea if the IUD is copper. The choice of contraceptive requires client teaching and monitoring for complications, when indicated. Different methods may be used by a female ora male during their reproductive years. Some individuals have difficulty withfertility when contraceptives are discontinued. Thus, when couples plan toattempt pregnancy, they may transition to nonpharmacologic means of birthcontrol for a period prior to discontinuing birth control entirely. GENETIC CONSIDERATIONS Many conditions can be transmitted from the parents to the infant through thegenetic code passed along through the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). To eval-uate the possibility of a child inheriting a condition, the genetic makeup of theparents is examined.CHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 57 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Studies have been done to map out human DNA to identify the sourceor marker for some conditions and behaviors with the hope of repairingor replacing defective genes with healthy ones. /H17035The importance of genetic testing of the parents is as follows: It allows for the possibility of avoiding the transmission of defec- tive genes through family planning with the choice not to reproduce. It provides an opportunity for the parents to prepare for the birth of a child with a chromosomal abnormality. Genetic conditions can be passed along through distinct mechanisms based on the dominant or recessive nature of the gene involved. Some condi-tions occur more often in persons who descended from certain geographiclocations across the globe. /H17035Adominant gene exerts influence over another gene and thus the char- acteristic carried on the gene is expressed. For example, brown eye colormay be on a dominant gene, and if a child has one gene with blue eyecolor and one with brown eye color, the child's eye color will be brown. /H17035Conversely, a recessive gene can only result in the expression of a char- acteristic if it is paired with another recessive gene for that characteristic.For example, if the gene for a disease is passed on in a recessive manner,both parents must provide the gene to the child in order for the child tomanifest that disease. /H17035Individuals with one chromosome that has the condition and one thatdoes not are considered \" carriers ,\" since they may not manifest any phenotype of the condition but are able to pass it along to their children. Females carry two X chromosomes and males carry an X and a Y chromo- some. Genetic traits and conditions might also be passed on through gender-linked genes. /H17035If a condition is linked to the X chromosome, the condition behaves asa recessive gene for the female who must have two genes that carry thecondition in order to manifest it. /H17035The male will manifest the X-linked condition if his one X gene carriesit because the Y gene carried by the male is unable to overcome theX gene. /H17035In order for a daughter to inherit an X-linked condition, the father musthave the condition and the mother must either have the condition or bea carrier. 4Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 58 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035The daughter of a father with an X-linked condition will at a minimum be a carrier since the X chromosome inherited from the father will beaffected. /H17035A son can inherit a condition if the mother has the condition or is a carrierand passes the affected X chromosome to the son. /H17035The son of an affected father cannot inherit the condition if the motherdoes not have the condition and is not a carrier, because the son doesnot inherit the X chromosome from his father (Fig. 4.1). SICKLE CELL ANEMIA WHAT WENT WRONG? In sickle cell anemia (SCA)/HgbSS cell disease, an abnormal gene results in production of an irregular red blood cell called hemoglobin (hgb) S, whichreplaces some of the normal hemoglobin A. The red blood cells collapse intoa crescent shape (sickling) when stressed such as during dehydration, hypoxemia,4CHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 59 Parents: Offspring:XY XX XX XX X Y XYFather with abnormal gene on X sex chromosomeMother with normal X sex chromosomes Figure 4.1 Genetic transmission.

These cells also have a short life span, result-ing in early destruction due to damaged cell membranes and low blood count\u2014anemia. This condition is an autosomal recessive condition requiring the genefrom both parents. Some clients inherit one gene and may exhibit the sickle celltrait, which may or may not be symptomatic under severe conditions such ashypoxia during exertion in low oxygen settings (high altitude). Clients ofAfrican descent have a high incidence of sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is a chronic illness with distress resulting from blocked and inadequate circulation and tissue/organ damage that causes pain and, overtime, organ failure and death. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Acute pain due to blocked blood vessels and tissue ischemia found in: Extremities: Swelling of hands, feet, and joints\u2014dactylitis (hand-foot syndrome) Abdomen Chest: Pain and pulmonary disease Liver: and hepatic coma /H17035Crisis episodes due to: Vaso-occlusion: The most common crisis due to blocked blood flow from sickling Sequestration Aplastic crisis due to extreme drop in red blood cells (RBCs) (often viral trigger) Megaloblastic anemia with excess need for folic acid or vitamin B 12 resulting in deficiency Hyperhemolytic crisis: Rapid RBC destruction\u2014anemia, jaundice, with effectivetreatment. /H17035Fatigue is secondary to the anemia. /H17035Fever during a sickling episode is possibly due to infection that provokeddistress. /H17035Pooling of blood (sequestration) in organs resulting in enlargement: Splenomegaly Hepatomegaly /H17035Organ damage due to vessel blockage: Heart (cardiomegaly) with weakened heart valves and heart murmur Lungs, kidneys, liver, and spleen malfunction and failure4Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 60 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

HEMOPHILIA Hemophilia is a group of congenital bleeding disorders due to a deficiency of specific coagulation proteins. This condition is occurs most commonly in per- sons of African descent, possibly as a genetic adaptation in trait carriers as protection from malaria. WHAT WENT WRONG? Hemophilia results most often from a genetic defect and most commonly adeficiency of factor VIII (hemophilia A) or factor IX (hemophilia B or Christmasdisease). However, a third of hemophilia cases occur from a gene mutation.The X-linked form of the condition is passed when an affected male (XhY)mates with a female carrier (XhX) producing a 1 in 4 chance of the offspringhaving a girl or a boy with the disease, having a girl who is a carrier, or hav-ing a child without the disease or trait. The female carrier can also besymptomatic. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Bleeding of varied degrees depending on the severity of the deficiency: Spontaneous bleeding Bleeding with trauma Bleeding with major trauma or surgery /H17035Hemarthrosis (bleeding into the joints) in the knees, elbows, and ankles begins with stiffness, tingling, or ache as an early sign of bleeding andprogressive damage. /H17035Warmth, redness, swelling, and severe pain, and loss of movement. /H17035Epistaxis (not the most frequent bleed). /H17035Hematomas may cause pain at the site due to pressure. /H17035Intracranial bleeding can cause changes in neurostatus and progress todeath. Nurse Alert Bleeding from mouth, throat, or neck could result in airway obstruction and warrants immediate attention.

Nurse Alert NSAIDs should be used cautiously since they inhibit platelet function. /H17035Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA, Amicar) blocks clot destruction. Exercise and physical therapy with active range of motion as clienttolerates to strengthen muscles around joints. Nurse Alert After an acute episode avoid passive range of motion due to possible joint capsule stretching with bleeding. Client should control active range of motion according to pain tolerance. NURSING INTERVENTION /H17035Maintain protective environment to prevent injury to client. /H17035Monitor closely for signs of bleeding. /H17035Treat bleeding episodes promptly. /H17035Apply pressure to nares if nosebleed is noted. /H17035Minimize crippling due to contractures and joint damage from bleeding: Promote complete absorption of blood from joints.

Explain that for each pregnancy when father has the condition and the mother is a carrier there is a 50% chance that a female or malechild will be born with the disease. There is a 100% chance a femalechild will have the trait for hemophilia if the father has the diseaseand the mother does not have the trait or the disease. Refer for counseling and family planning if additional childbearing is desired. Discuss alternative parenting options: Insemination, adoption, etc. Nurse Alert Avoid aspirin compounds and substitute acetaminophen since aspirin impairs platelet function. -THALASSEMIA Thalassemia is an inherited disorder involving deficiency in the production of globin chains in hemoglobin. The beta form of the disorder is the most com-mon form and is found most often in persons of Greek, Italian, and Syriandescent. An alpha form of thalassemia is found in people of Chinese, Thai,African, and Mediterranean descent, possibly due to genetic mutation throughintermarriages, or due to spontaneous mutation. WHAT WENT WRONG? Thalassemia is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the alpha or betapolypeptide chains in hemoglobin A are impacted. In -thalassemia there is aCHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 65 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

NURSING INTERVENTION /H17035Promote adherence to treatment regimen. /H17035Support child during illness and distressing treatments. /H17035 Promote child and family coping: Anticipate adolescent concerns related to appearance. /H17035Monitor closely for complications of the condition and treatment: Multiple transfusions and iron buildup Infection post-splenectomy /H17035 Genetic counseling: Encourage testing of siblings to allow for childbearing planning. Explain that for each pregnancy when both parents are carriers there is a 25% chance a child will be born with the disease and a 50%chance the child will have the thalassemia trait. Refer for counseling and family planning if additional childbearing is desired. Discuss alternative parenting options: Insemination, adoption, etc. Some chromosomal abnormalities can occur if the 46 chromosomes do not divide evenly and one parent contributes an extra chromosome or a chromo-some is missing. In most cases, infants will have a minimum of one X chromo-some, but in some cases a male may have an extra X, giving a genotype of XXYinstead of the XY . This condition is called Klinefelter syndrome and may bemanifested with underdeveloped testes, enlarged breasts, and tall stature. Turnersyndrome, on the other hand, is a condition in which females are missing anX chromosome, resulting in an XO instead of XX, or the second X is incomplete. The manifestations of this condition may include webbed neck, short stature,infertility, and difficulty with mathema tics and possible problems with language. A condition called fragile X syndrome is one in which the child receives a defective X, which often breaks. The primary manifestation is mental retarda-tion, short attention span, and learning disability. These manifestations are morecommon in affected males since the female has an additional X chromosomethat might block the defective gene's impact on the child. DOWN SYNDROME WHAT WENT WRONG? Down syndrome is a genetic disorder resulting in retardation most commonlycaused by 3 instead of 2 chromosomes 21. Down syndrome can also be causedby translocation of chromosome 21 where a portion breaks off and attaches toanother chromosome. 66CHAPTER 4 / Pre-pregnancy Preparation, Conception 67 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Abnormal chromosomes might occur because the mother is older than 34 or the father is older than 41 at the time of conception. It might also occurbecause of a virus or radiation. The degree of mental retardation will vary. Some patients are fully dependent on their caregivers. Other patients can function with little assistance.

A low level is linked to Down syndrome. /H17035Inhibit A serum test: Inhibit A inhibits the pituitary gland from produc-ing the FSH hormone. An increased level of inhibit A is linked to Downsyndrome. /H17035Human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, which is used todetermine pregnancy. An increase in the subunit of the human chori- onic gonadotropin hormone is linked to Down syndrome. /H17035-fetoprotein (AFP) serum test: A decrease in -fetoprotein is linked to Down syndrome. /H17035Amniocentesis: Identifies the chromosome abnormality and is per-formed if the mother is older than 34 years of age or if the father carriesa translocated chromosome. TREATMENTS /H17035There is no cure for Down syndrome. /H17035Provide occupational therapy to help the child master the skills of inde-pendent living when possible. /H17035Provide speech therapy to help the child develop communications skills. /H17035Treatment is focused on treating the complications of Down syndromesuch as trauma and infection.544Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 68 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Several methods of barrier protection also protect against STDs. Pharmacologic methods of contraception may prevent pregnancy but do not protect against STDs. Choosing the best method for contraception requires weighing benefits against disadvantages. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 74 OVERVIEW Pregnancy can present challenges to a childbearing family, but conditions encountered prior to pregnancy or in the early stages of pregnancy can posea challenge to the pregnancy. Injury to, or infection of, reproductive struc-tures could prevent or delay conception and pregnancy. Because fetal devel-opment in the early stages is sensitive to environmental factors, infection canresult in congenital defects. INFERTILITY As stated in the previous chapter, conception requires fertilization of anovum with a sperm. Pituitary hormones such as follicle-stimulating hor-mone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are needed to stimulate therelease of an egg from the ovaries. A pregnancy proceeds when the fertilizedegg implants into the wall of the woman's uterus and the fetus grows untilbirth. Contraception can be used to prevent fertilization or pregnancy whendesired, but sometimes fertilization or pregnancy is inhibited through unin-tended measures. The definition of infertility is the inability to become pregnant after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. An expandeddefinition would include circumstances when a couple is unable to conceiveor the woman is unable to carry a child to live birth, which both result ininability to bear a child. The causes of infertility are varied and the medicalcare required is specific to the teaching and interventions associated with thecause. Nursing care may include assisting with interventions or possiblysupporting the couple if infertility cannot be resolved and they must seekalternative measures to having a child or resign themselves to remainingchildless.

Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. WHAT WENT WRONG? Infertility can result from a number of causes, ranging from simple to com- plex. In order for fertilization to occur: 1. An egg must be released and travel into the fallopian tube. 2. Sufficient sperm must be released (ejaculated) into the vagina. 3. Sperm must swim through the uterus and enter the fallopian tube.4. Sperm must meet and penetrate the egg.5. The fertilized egg must travel down into the uterus.6. The fertilized egg must implant in the uterine wall. If anything goes wrong with any of these steps, secondary to the absence of eggs, blocked fallopian tubes, insufficient number or mobility of sperm, vaginal or uterine environment that is fatal to sperm, or uterine wallthat is unreceptive to implantation, infertility can result. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035The primary symptom is inability to get pregnant after 1 year of trying. /H17035A woman may experience irregular or absent menstrual periods. /H17035Symptoms of hormone imbalance, including alterations in hair growth,sex organs, or sexual function, may be noted. /H17035If infertility is associated with an infection, vaginal or penile drainageand discomfort may be noted. /H17035Physical examination can reveal hypospadias: Urethral opening located on the underside of the penis preventing sperm from reaching the female cervix. TEST RESULTS /H17035Physical examination: Weight and height (obesity or anorexia can contribute to infertility). Urethral opening located on the underside of the penis: Hypospadias . /H17035Ovulation testing: Blood testing for ovulation. /H17035FSH or LH levels may be too low to stimulate egg release. /H17035Hormone testing: Elevated prolactin or androgen levels (may block ovulation). /H17035Testosterone levels may be deficient. /H17035Hysterosalpingography (an X-ray to determine flow from uterus tofallopian tubes), or laparoscopy or culdoscopy (direct observation of thefemale pelvic organs) may reveal adhesions, altered ovaries that mayimpact function, or uterine anomalies (fibroid tumors). /H17035Pelvic ultrasound of the scrotum or uterus to determine structural defectsor obstructions. /H17035Sperm analysis: Testing may reveal inadequate number or function. Sperm count may be low (less than 5 million per mL of semen). Sperm mobility may be limited.321CHAPTER 5 / Reproductive Health Issues 75 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Endocervical culture may reveal an infection which may result in scar- ring of the fallopian tubes with blockage of the egg passage or that maypresent a danger to the mother and fetus. /H17035Male infection may impact sperm motility (prostatitis, ofsperm passage /H17035Genetic testing may reveal a defect such as Klinefelter's syndrome(XXY chromosomes) in which the man has abnormal testicular devel-opment with absence of sperm production. /H17035Urinalysis may reveal sperm in urine, indicating retrograde ejaculation(backward flow). /H17035Nutrition testing for signs of malnutrition, particularly decreased vitamin B12, iron, zinc, selenium, folate, and vitamin C. /H17035Steroid testing may reveal anabolic steroid levels that may cause testi-cles to shrink and decrease sperm production. /H17035Tests that reveal chronic illnesses that cause decreased sexual functionsuch as cystic fibrosis (blocked vas deferens\u2014 the tube that carries sperm from the testes through the penis), diabetes (impotence, retro-grade ejaculation), thyroid disease (hyper- or hypothyroidism can disruptthe menstrual cycle or cause impotence), anemia, HIV/AIDS, kidneydisease, sickle cell disease (can contribute to fertility), or hypertension(medications can cause impotence). TREATMENTS /H17035Early medical evaluation by a gynecologist if menstrual irregularity isnoted, or a urologist if low sperm count or testicular, prostate, or sexualproblems are noted, to promote early treatment. /H17035Increased sexual intercourse activity a minimum of 2-3 times per week mayimprove fertility. Refrain from ejaculation between intercourse activities. /H17035Proper nutrition with folate, zinc, and other nutrients, with limited caffeineand alcohol intake, which can increase risk of miscarriage. /H17035Avoid excessive exercise (8 hours or more per week), which can decreaseovulation. /H17035Smoking cessation, since tobacco can decrease fertility and contribute tomiscarriage. /H17035Shield testes during cancer treatment with radiation, when possible, toprevent impairment of sperm production. Storage of sperm prior to treat-ment with chemotherapy or radiation may preserve sperm for laterfertilization of egg. /H17035Surgical procedures to correct structural problems such as varicocele (mass of dilated veins within the scrotum that can elevate temperature andlower sperm count), hypospadias, or blocked vas deferens (fertilitymay be restored within 6 months to a year). A woman may undergo asalpingectomy to remove a damaged fallopian tube that might produce4Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 76 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Follicledevelopment may be monitored with ultrasound, and intercourse orintrauterine insemination timed to promote fertilization. /H17035Intrauterine insemination may be performed if sperm are unable to pen-etrate the cervix due to mucus or other reasons. /H17035Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) may be administered by a fertil-ity specialist to stimulate ovulation. /H17035In vitro fertilization\u2014removal of eggs from the ovary, fertilization, thenimplantation of the fertilized egg into the uterus\u2014and other high-techtreatments are well publicized but are used to treat less than 10% of allcases of infertility. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Teach the couple the importance of proper diet and need for adequatefolate, vitamins, and minerals to promote fertility and healthy pregnancy. /H17035Assist in screening of women for infections and pelvic inflammatorydisease to promote early treatment. /H17035Emphasize the importance of the use of barriers to promote safe sex orthe use of abstinence to avoid sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). /H17035Report findings from history and physical examination that may requiretreatment to promote fertility. /H17035Support female and male during fertility testing or in the decision not toundergo testing due to cost and discomfort. /H17035Assist the couple in withdrawal from abused substances including drugs,alcohol, smoking, and tobacco cessation as indicated. /H17035Instruct the couple on the importance of timing of fertility treatment andintercourse. /H17035Assist the couple in exploring alternatives including the use of a sperm or egg donor, surrogacy (use of another female to carry and deliver the child),or adoption. Nurse Alert Infertility issues can be sensitive for the couple involved; thus, the nurse must be non-judgmental and supportive of the couple's decision making. PREGNANCY TERMINATION On some occasions an unintended pregnancy may occur, such as in adolescentpregnancy or in the case of rape. The female is faced with three alternatives:to complete the pregnancy and parent the child, to complete the pregnancy15CHAPTER 5 / Reproductive Health Issues 77 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. and allow the child to be adopted, or to terminate the pregnancy. Pregnancy can be terminated intentionally or can terminate spontaneously for a numberof reasons. Pregnancy termination will be discussed from an intentional or aspontaneous perspective. WHAT WENT WRONG? An intentional or induced pregnancy termination ( abortion ) may be chosen when the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother, the fetus is at high riskof having a severe defect, or the pregnancy is undesired, possibly resultingfrom rape or abuse. In the case of adolescent pregnancy, the young womanmay choose this option with or without her parent's input. Although abortionis a controversial issue, the health-care provider must remain objective andnon-judgmental and allow the woman to make her own decision wit hout being pressured. Induced abortion can result in complications from retained products of con- ception such as the placenta, amnion, and fetus. Retained products can causeinfection and eventual sepsis. Commonly septic abortion occurs with illegalabortions being performed by persons who have limited training or experience. Spontaneous abortion/ miscarriage is the death of the fetus or expelling of the fetus and placenta prior to the 20th week of pregnancy. An earlymiscarriage occurs before the 12th week and late miscarriage occurs betweenthe 12th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. The most common causes of miscarriageinclude certain viruses\u2014most notably herpes, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus, orthe normal development of the fetus,such as chromosomal anomalies. Trauma or imm unologic anomalies can result in spontaneous abortion. Sometimes the cause is undetermined. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS The symptoms of spontaneous abortion may vary depending on stage: /H17035Crampy pelvic pain, bleeding, and possible tissue expulsion. Abortionmay present in varied forms: Threatened abortion may present with vaginal bleeding (possible ruptured membrane) without cervical dilation. Inevitable abortion may present with vaginal bleeding with cervical dilation (opening of cervical os will admit tip of finger). Incomplete abortion will reveal expulsion of some products of conception (amnion, placenta, or fetus), and may appear like a bloodclot; it could become septic due to remaining products. Septic abortion will present with signs of infection including chills, pain, fever or hypothermia, vaginal discharge, and possible hypoten-sion, oliguria, and respiratory distress from sepsis. Missed abortion may have no symptoms immediately after fetal death due to the absence of bleeding or expulsion of product, but21Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 78 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. growth of the fetus and fetal activity is not noted and over time may progress to septic abortion. Recurrent abortion occurs when two or more previous miscarriages were experienced. TEST RESULTS /H17035Urine test will be positive for hCG but without progressive increase inserum levels. /H17035Absent or low serum hCG could indicate abortion is complete, whilehigher levels could indicate incomplete abortion. /H17035Ultrasound will reveal an empty uterus or partial products of conceptionremaining in the uterus and absence of fetal heart beat in late abortion. /H17035Chromosomal assessment may be performed to determine if chromosomalabnormality such as aneuploidy \u2014missing or extra X chromosome\u2014may have contributed to the abortion (particularly in recurrent abortions). /H17035Endocrine disorders may reveal abnormal thyroid or glucose levels. /H17035Immune condition may reveal lupus or other antibodies. /H17035Physical examination may reveal incompetent cervix or structural anomalyin the cervix or uterus, such as polyps or fibroids, which may damage thefetus and result in abortion. TREATMENTS /H17035Bed rest to reduce cramping and bleeding. /H17035Abstain from sexual intercourse to prevent infection. /H17035Medical induction of labor and evacuation of products of conceptionmay be performed for late abortion (16th week or later). /H17035Suction curettage may be performed to remove products of conceptionif earlier than 12th week of pregnancy. /H17035Partial or missed abortion (at 12th or later weeks) may require surgicalscraping\u2014dilation and curettage (D&C)\u2014of the uterus to remove allproducts of conception. /H17035Administration of medication to cause cervical dilation to facilitate evac-uation of the uterus may be done prior to D&C. Antibiotics are administered for septic abortion. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Note women who are at risk for spontaneous abortion\u2014particularly ifprevious miscarriages were experienced. /H17035If abortion is reported, monitor for signs of partially retained products ofconception such as bleeding or signs of infection. /H17035Monitor for complications of uterine evacuation: Bleeding or uterinerupture, particularly in late abortion.543CHAPTER 5 / Reproductive Health Issues 79 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Provide emotional support in case of induced (intentional) or sponta- neous abortion to assist female and male with feelings of guilt and grief.Reassure female and male that spontaneous abortion is not due to actionsof either party. /H17035In the case of induced abortion at the choice of the mother, remain sup-portive and non-judgmental, regardless of nurse's personal opinion. /H17035If indicated, refer for counseling, particularly in the situation of recurrentabortion. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED AND OTHER DISEASES Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) present a major danger to a female prior to pregnancy, to an expectant mother, and to an unborn child. The inci-dence of STDs is high in adolescents and thus presents a particular risk factorin adolescent pregnancy. Early diagnosis and treatment of an STD prior to preg-nancy would be preferable, but treatment at as early a point as possible couldminimize the damage to the fetus and maternal morbidity or mortality. A groupof infections that can negatively affect the fetus during pregnancy is labeledwith the acronym TORCH, which represents Toxoplasmosis, Other Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex an infection contracted from eating uncooked or under-cooked meat, or handling of cat stool. Symptoms are flu-like, or swollenlymph nodes may be noted. Parasitic treatment is necessary with a combi-nation of sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine, which could also harm the fetus. /H17035Other infections include the sexually transmitted conditions discussedlater in this chapter. /H17035Rubella is contracted from contact with children with German measles,and the newborn may contract it from a mother who has rubella at the timeof birth. Symptoms for the woman include rash, mild lymphedema, muscleaches, and joint pain, but fetal impact can include spontaneous abortion,congenital abnormalities, and death. The primary intervention is preventionwith vaccination prior to pregnancy. Nurse Alert Vaccination after pregnancy is contraindicated due to the risk of contracting ru bella. /H17035Cytomegalovirus is a herpes-related virus transmitted from contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The fetus becomes infected inutero or when passing through the birth canal if the mother is infected.The woman is often asymptomatic and diagnosis by amniotic fluid cul-ture is most reliable. Fetal impact can include growth restriction withSGA (small-for-gestational age) infants, hydramnios, cardiomegaly, fetal11Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 80 Downloaded by [ Faculty Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

A screen-ing is performed to identify these conditions in the mother or newbornat the earliest possible point. CHLAMYDIAL INFECTION WHAT WENT WRONG? Chlamydia infection is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , an organism that is partially parasitic and able to become part of the host cell despite the host'sdefenses. The organism then invades other host cells and within 40 hoursmanifests a full infection. Infections can progress to pelvic inflammatorydisease (PID) and cause ectopic pregnancy, epididymitis, and infertility. Theinfection can also cause premature birth in addition to conjunctivitis andpneumonia in the newborn. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Chlamydia may be asymptomatic for many infected with the organism. /H17035Vaginal discharge may be noted. /H17035Dysuria may be experienced by both males and females. /H17035Menstrual irregularities may occur if infection moves into theendometrium and fallopian tubes. /H17035Males may experience urethral discharge. /H17035Proctitis\u2014inflammation of the anus and rectum\u2014may be noted. TEST RESULTS /H17035Culture from a urine, urethra, cervix, or vaginal specimen. /H17035Leukocyte esterase (LE) activity in urine is used to diagnose urethritisin males. /H17035Rapid antigen test, or polymerase or ligase chain reaction (PCR or LCR) tests. TREATMENTS /H17035Azithromycin in a single dose. /H17035Doxycycline over 7 days. /H17035All sexual partners must be treated. /H17035Abstain from sexual intercourse until treatment is completed for both sexualpartners to prevent reinfection. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Instruct client on the importance of completing the full regimen of 7-daytherapy.543215CHAPTER 5 / Reproductive Health Issues 81 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

GONORRHEA WHAT WENT WRONG? This infection is caused by the bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae . The condi- tion is often found in conjunction with a chlamydial infection and may befound after progression to PID. If infection occurs after the third month ofpregnancy, the organism may be contained in the lower pelvic area in the ure-thra and cervix due to a mucous plug in the cervix that prevents expansionupward. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035May be asymptomatic. /H17035Common Urinary frequency /H17035Vulval inflammation. /H17035Cervical swelling and erosion may be noted. TEST RESULTS /H17035Pre-pregnancy or initial prenatal screening (or end pregnancy testing forhigh-risk mothers) may reveal positive culture. /H17035Urethral, throat, or rectal culture may be positive for gonorrhea if alter-native entrance sites are used for sexual intercourse. TREATMENTS /H17035Non-pregnant women and partners may be treated with cefixime orceftri axone in combination with treatment for hromycin or amoxicillin. /H17035Cultures are repeated 1-2 weeks after treatment. /H17035All sexual partners must be treated. /H17035Pregnant women and partners must be treated with cefixime orally orceftriaxone intramuscularly in combination with treatment for chlamydiawith azithromycin or amoxicillin.4321Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 82 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

PELVIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE (PID) WHAT WENT WRONG? The infection of the endometrium, fallopian tubes, and the ovaries can becaused by several sexually transmitted organisms, including N. gonorrhoeae , C. trachomatis , or anaerobic bacteria. The spread of the infection can be fueled by the presence of an intrauterine device (IUD), douching, or menstruation,as well as active sperm, which can transmit the organisms into the genitaltract. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Tenderness in the lower abdomen and adnexal (tissue around the uterus)region. /H17035Fever (38.3 \u00b0C [101 \u00b0F] or higher). /H17035Cervical discharge and tenderness with movement. /H17035In adolescents, may manifest as generalized discomfort with lower abdominal pain and flu-like symptoms such as malaise, nausea, diar-rhea, or constipation. /H17035Urinary tract symptoms. /H17035Infertility can occur due to scarring of the tubes. /H17035Ectopic pregnancy may occur after PID incident. /H17035Chronic abdominal pain. /H17035Abscess of the tubules and ovaries may be a complication. /H17035Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome, with upper abdominal pain and possibleperitoneal and hepatic adhesions. /H17035Prolonged pelvic pain or dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse) may occur after PID.215CHAPTER 5 / Reproductive Health Issues 83 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

SYPHILIS WHAT WENT WRONG? This chronic infection results from the spirochete Treponema pallidum acquired congenitally from the mother or through sexual intercourse with aninfected individual or exposure to an open wound or infected blood. The infec-tion occurs 10-90 days after exposure. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035No symptoms may be noted. /H17035Early stage may reveal a chancre at the entrance site of T. pallidum , which may be noted for 4 weeks. /H17035Fever, weight loss, and malaise may be noted. /H17035Secondary symptoms may be noted 6 weeks to 6 months after infection: Condylomata lata (wart-like skin plaques/eruptions) on the vulva that are highly infectious Acute arthritis, and liver and spleen enlargement Non-tender, enlarged lymph nodes, and iritis Chronic sore throat, and hoarseness /H17035Newborn may demonstrate secondary symptoms if infected in utero. /H17035If syphilis is transmitted transplacentally, intrauterine growth may bediminished. /H17035Preterm birth or stillbirth may be noted.

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 92 OVERVIEW The stages of pregnancy have designated periods during which fetal growth and maternal changes occur. Each of the major periods is referred to as atrimester (roughly one-third of the approximate 9 months of pregnancy). In Chapter 3 the stages of fetal development were reviewed. The first trimesterof pregnancy will incorporate the ovum and embryo stages and beginningfetal stages of development. The second and third trimesters involve theremaining time in the fetal stage. This chapter reviews the maternal changesexperienced as the pregnancy proceeds from the first to the third trimester andrelated nursing care needed to support a healthy pregnancy. FIRST TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY The first trimester involves the time period from conception and formation of thezygote (ovum stage) through the transition to an embryo (15th day to 8 weeks) andthen a fetus (week 9 to 12 or 13). This period includes the discovery that a preg-nancy is under way and moves through the point at which the gender of the fetuscan be determined. Several signs and symptoms are noted during this period. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Presumptive signs: Subjective symptoms or objective signs that might lead the woman to suspect she might be pregnant.12Amniocentesis Ballottement Braxton-Hicks contractions Chadwick's sign EpistaxisGoodell's sign GravityHegar's signs Presumptive signs Probable signsPseudoanemiaQuickeningTrimester KEY TERMS Amenorrhea Nausea and vomiting Fatigue Urinary frequencyQuickening: Fluttering move- ment Uterine enlargement Linea nigraCholasma: Darkening of skin on the face (mask of pregnancy) Striae gravidarum Breast changes Darkened areola Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

These changes result from physical changesin the uterus during early pregnancy.CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 93 Abdominal enlargement related to changes in uterine size, shape,and position Cervical changesChadwick's sign: Deep purple- blue colored vaginal lining dueto increased blood vessels Goodell's sign: Softening of the cervix Hegar's sign: Softening and increased flexibility of the loweruterusBallottement: Rebound of unengaged fetus Positive pregnancy test Palpable fetal outlineBraxton-Hicks contractions: False uterine contraction that,unlike true labor, causes minimalpain and are irregularcontractions /H17035Positive signs: Signs that can exclusively be explained by pregnancy. Once the pregnancy is confirmed, the health-care provider will deter- mine the expected delivery date. Two methods may be used to deter-mine the delivery date: Nagele's rule: Starting with the first day of the last menstrual cycle, subtract 3 months, and add 7 days and 1 year. McDonald's method: Start with the measurement of uterine fundal height in centimeters from the symphysis pubis to the top of the uterinefundus (between 18 to 30 weeks gestation age). Gestational age isequal to the fundal height.

Menstrual cycle stops (in early months spotting may be noted), and the uterus enlarges, alters in shape, and shifts in position. 2. Integumentary/skin changes occur due to hormones and stretch of skin as body enlarges during pregnancy (striae gravidarum/stretch marks).Many changes disappear after pregnancy (cholasma) but some remain(stretch marks). Increased secretion of sebum and skin oiliness may benoted, and palmar erythema (pink palms) or spider nevi (small redangiomas) may be noted on the face, neck, chest, arms, and legs due toincreased estrogen levels with increased blood flow to tissues. 3. Nose, sinuses, mouth, and throat may reveal nasal stuffiness, gums may be swollen and bleeding, and nosebleeds ( epistaxis ) may be noted due to vascular congestion from estrogen, in addition to voice changes dueto laryngeal swelling. 4. Blood volume increases, and heart rate as well as cardiac output increase to meet the mother and fetus's needs. Increased plasma volume resultsin a dilution of red blood cells and a pseudoanemia (a physiologic ane- mia in which the blood cells are not decreased but the plasma volumecauses fewer cells per volume). 5. Respiratory workload is increased as oxygen needs increase for the mother to supply oxygen for herself and the child, and clear respiratorywaste. 6. Breast changes due to estrogen and progesterone include increased sensation, breast and nipple enlargement, superficial vein engorge-ment, striae gravidarum, and hyperpigmentation of the nipple andareola. 7. Abdominal muscles and pelvic ligaments stretch with the enlarging uterus. Lower pelvic pain may be noted. Progesterone causes decreasedsmooth muscle relaxation with slower stomach emptying and reflux/heartburn, and decreased gastric motility resulting in constipation.Increased blood flow and constipation contribute to hemorrhoids (rec-tal varicose veins). Nausea and vomiting of the first trimester, due toshifts in hormones, is accompanied by hunger due to increased demandsfor nutrients. Pressure on the stomach and intestines as the fetus growswill increase dyspepsia, heartburn, and constipation. Carbohydratemetabolism is altered, leading to hypoglycemia in the first and secondtrimesters from increased tissue sensitivity to insulin and increased useof glucose and production of insulin from beta cell hypertrophy andhyperplasia. In the third trimester, hyperglycemia may result fromdecreased tissue sensitivity to insulin. 8. Urinary patterns may change due to increased blood volume, with cir- culation to kidneys. Urinary frequency may be noted with increased fre-quency as the growing fetus presses against the bladder.2Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 94 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Hearing may be diminished and earache may be perceived due to increased vascularity of the inner ear and blockage of the eustachiantube and feeling of fullness in the ears. WHAT WENT WRONG? Gestational Trophoblastic Disease During the early stage of pregnancy, the first trimester, there are several complications that may occur, beginning with the pregnancy itself. /H17035In a condition called gestational trophoblastic disease the trophoblasticvilli in the placenta begin to degenerate and become swollen and filledwith fluid. The embryo does not develop beyond the cell duplication,becoming a mole-like mass with an appearance similar to grape clus-ters. The genetic material in the mass can be derived from paternal DNAor maternally and paternally. /H17035While some fetal material might be present in the mass, and humanchorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels are high, there is no growth, organdevelopment, or activity. Life is not present. /H17035Women at high risk for the condition are those with low protein intakeor age extremes (<18 years old or >35 years old). /H17035The condition is strongly associated with choriocarcinoma. /H17035Three complications that occur in early pregnancy, and are discussed ina later chapter, are as follows: Spontaneous abortion, fetal death prior to 20 weeks gestation, second- ary to chromosomal abnormalities or other developmental issues ortrauma. Ectopic pregnancy, pregnancy that occurs outside the uterus. Hyperemesis gravidarum (HEG) is excessive vomiting due to hor- mones that may result in malnutrition, dehydration, and otherproblems. Signs and Symptoms /H17035Gestational trophoblastic disease may be discovered with: Vaginal bleeding around the 16th week that is either brown or bright red (scant or heavy) Rapid uterine growth beyond normal expected pregnancy growth hCG levels that are elevated, accompanied by severe nausea and vomiting (hyperemesis) Ultrasound that reveals vesicular growths but no fetus Urinalysis that may contain proteinuria Clear vaginal drainage from vesicles Pregnancy-induced hypertension (edema, hypertension, proteinuria) prior to the 20th week of gestation4CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 95 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. TEST RESULTS IN EARLY PREGNANCY /H17035History: Gravity (number of pregnancies), term births (38 weeks or greater), preterm births (37 weeks or fewer), abortions/miscarriages,live children, para (birth after 20 weeks gestation, live or stillborn),family history, lifestyle and health practices, activity and rest patterns,environmental toxin exposure, family and social history, and supportresources. These data could reveal risk factors for complications. /H17035Hormones levels reveal an increase from pre-pregnancy state: hCG,progesterone, estrogen, human placental lactogen, and prostaglandins are increased to maintain pregnancy and prompt alterations in body toprepare for labor and delivery. /H17035Genetic testing, particularly if the mother or the father is 35 years oldor older. /H17035Blood typing and Rh factor testing to determine possible incompatibilitybetween maternal and fetal blood, resulting in destruction of fetal bloodcells (erythroblastosis fetalis). /H17035Ultrasound with the use of high frequency sound waves to produce athree-dimensional image of internal body structures and tissues. A con-ducting transducer is used to direct the waves over the abdomen or vagi-nally toward internal structures. Ultrasound can be done by externalabdominal or internal transvaginal approach. /H17035Ultrasound is useful to determine several aspects of the pregnancy,including gestational age, fetal growth and viability, maternal pelvic pro-portions, and placental placement and attachment. Nurse Alert To prepare a woman for abdominal ultrasound: One to two quarts of fluid should be consumed to fill the bladder. Position the woman supine with back supports. Warm the conducting gel, if possible, but inform the woman that the gel will be placed on her abdomen and may be cool initially. Nurse Alert To prepare a woman for transvaginal ultrasound: Position the woman in a lithotomy position and explain that the probe will be lubricated and inserted into the vagina and that pressure will befelt. Explain that the probe will be repositioned as needed to promote visualiza- tion of structures. /H17035Reassure the woman that no harm will come to fetus from the probe or ultra- sound waves.5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 96 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035In gestational trophoblastic disease, after mole evacuation is performed through suction curettage, hCG levels are monitored regularly, and ultra-sounds and pelvic exams are performed on a regular basis to determine the presence of a malignancy (choriocarcinoma). TREATMENTS /H17035Nutritious diet with adequate calories and recommended dietary allowances adjusted as dietary reference intakes (DRI) for pregnantfemales based on age. /H17035Prenatal vitamins are prescribed to ensure provision of adequate nutri-ents to the fetus without depriving the mother. /H17035Limited or no over-the-counter medications without clearance from ahealth-care provider to avoid possible teratogenic medications (whichare particularly dangerous in the first and second trimesters). /H17035Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), including massage,yoga, acupuncture, biofeedback, herbal or other homeopathic medi-cine, chiropractic treatments, or therapeutic touch may be offered asoptions to ease the discomforts of pregnancy and promote a sense ofwell-being. /H17035Treatment for gestational trophoblastic disease involves dilation andcurettage (D&C) to remove all products of conception. Postoperativecare is provided including monitoring for infection or hemorrhage. /H17035In gestational trophoblastic disease, if high hCG levels and enlarginguterus are noted, and choriocarcinoma is diagnosed, chemotherapy maybe administered. If the woman is Rh negative, immune globulin (RhoGAM) is admin- istered to decrease antibody buildup. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035At the initial contact with the pregnant woman the nurse should explainthe process of prenatal visits, including the pelvic exams and bloodtests. Nurse Alert Consider cultural norms related to pregnancy and childbirth. Accommodate cultural variations if no harm to the mother or fetus is likely.Communicate with the head of household in addition to the client if cul-turally appropriate to facilitate informed decision making and compliance with care.66CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 97 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Provide teaching on fetal development and related changes. Provide nutrition education and assist the mother in incorporating needed nutri-tional intake into the family diet. /H17035Encourage daily intake of prescribed prenatal vitamins and iron. Pro-vide strategies to help the mother overcome the side-effects of iron thatcan cause discomfort, i.e., constipation (encourage fruit and vegetablesfor fiber). /H17035Educate the mother and family on the progression of the pregnancy, i.e.,fetal development, and the importance of regular prenatal checkups, andchanges that will occur in her body as the pregnancy progresses. Discussstrategies to promote comfort: a. Supportive bra as breast heaviness increases.b. Increased rest for fatigue.c. Increase daily fluids and decrease evening intake to minimize nocturia. d. Lie on side to reduce pressure of fetus on bladder and major blood vessels. /H17035Instruct the woman and family regarding abnormal symptoms thatmight indicate problems in the pregnancy and when to seek medicalattention. /H17035 Encourage the expectant mother and father to talk with a caregiver and each other about the pregnancy and to expect that doubts and fearsmay emerge as they move through the pregnancy (particularly with thefirst child). Explain that emotional fluctuations are expected and thattalking may help in dealing with concerns. /H17035Discuss preparation for childbirth and provide information about child-birth classes. /H17035With gestational trophoblastic disease the nurse should: a. Assess for risk factors or signs and symptoms: Note rapid increased fundal height measurements, vaginal bleeding, severe hyperemesis,high blood pressure, and edema. b. Instruct the client to report and collect specimens of any tissue passed from the vagina for a health-care provider to examine. c. Stress the importance of contraception to avoid pregnancy for at least 6 months to allow monitoring for increasing hCG that couldindicate malignancy. Instruct the client on the importance of follow-up visits and testing. d. Support the client and family in emotional crises related to feelings of loss of a child. Refrain from judgment and do notminimize the client's sense of loss of a child. Explain as oftenas needed that the mass was not a living fetus, but support theirgrief.7Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 98 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

SECOND TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY The second trimester involves the period of fetal development from weeks 14 through 24 or 25. Colostrum may be expressed from the breasts beginning inthe second trimester. Dizziness and light-headedness might be noted at thebeginning of the second trimester because of progesterone and relaxation of thevessels with pooling of blood in the lower extremities (aggravated by pressurefrom the fetus and with prolonged standing). Additional changes that mayoccur include the following: /H17035The woman may gain 1 pound per week for the rest of the pregnancy. /H17035More energy is noted than in the first trimester. /H17035Increased vaginal secretions may be noted. Nurse Alert If complaint of itching or unpleasant odor is reported, an infection may be present.2CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 99 1. The nurse notes that a woman's fundal measurement is twice as large as expected at the third prenatal visit. The hCG level is high. Which symptom would be mostimportant as an additional sign that the woman might have gestational trophoblasticdisease? a. Report of increased fetal activity over the past weeks b. Report of extreme nausea and vomiting c. Swollen breasts with dark nipples and areolad. Nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness Answer:2. What should the nurse do if a pregnant woman reports urinary frequency that makes it difficult for her to sleep at night? a. Instruct the woman to take a mild diuretic in the mornings to reduce fluid.b. Encourage the woman to eat watermelon or lemon water prior to going to bed.c. Suggest that the woman drink fluids during the day and limit fluid intake at night. d. Recommend that the woman limit water intake to three glasses per day.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Decreased urinary frequency is noted when the uterus lifts out of the pelvic area during the second trimester. /H17035Increased abdominal size is noted due to the growing fetus, amnioticsac, and uterine size; itching may be noted due to the stretching ofskin. /H17035Skin changes such acnemay occur. /H17035Fetal movement is noted by the woman, with an increased sense that sheis truly pregnant. /H17035Late in the second trimester nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness may occur,as well as straie. /H17035Many tests that were more dangerous to the fetus earlier can be performedat this point. TEST RESULTS Doppler blood flow (umbilical velocimetry) may be done to measure the speed of red blood cell flow to detect perfusion problems in the placenta dur-ing the second and third trimesters. The peak velocity of the waves, the sys-tolic (S) measure, and the lowest wave point diastolic (D) are noted and theS/D ratio is measured. Normal ratio by 26 weeks gestation is 2.6, and by theend of the pregnancy term it is less than 3. A reading above 3 is abnormal. Anabnormal Doppler flow study in addition to low amniotic fluid levels mayindicate a risk for the infant being small for its gestational age, having respi-ratory distress, and having other poor-nutrition-related problems. Dopplerstudies are done as early as the 16th week and are repeated regularly for high-risk pregnancies. Amniocentesis is the aspiration of amniotic fluid to assess for fetal abnor- malities (such as a genetic condition) or fetal lung maturity. An ultrasound isused to locate the fetus; then a needle is inserted into the uterus to aspiratefluid. Nurse Alert Care during and after the procedure includes monitoring vital signs and watching for signs of maternal hypotension or excess venous return, as wellas monitoring fetal heart tones for signs of distress (continue monitoringclosely for the first 30-60 hours after the procedure). Instruct the woman tomonitor and record fetal movement and to report lack of movement immedi-ately; in addition, the woman should note and report any onset of contractions, vaginal drainage, fever, or chills. The quadruple screen is a less invasive test for genetic abnormalities such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21), neural tube defects (NTDs), or trisomy 18.5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 100 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The test assesses the serum levels of substances that may indicate adequate growth and lung development\u2014 -fetoprotein definitive diagnosis of the conditions. Fetal lung maturity: Phospholipids that compose surfactant that lines the alveoli of the lungs, such as lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) at a ratio of2:1, and the presence of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) with associated lamellarbody counts (LBCs) of over 32,000 indicate that lung maturity is present. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): A sample obtained transabdominally or transcervically from the developing placenta can be used to detect geneticanomalies. This procedure can be done as early as the 10th week of gestationand provides an earlier diagnosis than amniocentesis but carries a higher riskfor fetal injury or mortality. Possible complications include ruptured mem-branes, amniotic fluid leakage, bleeding, infection, and Rh alloimmuniza-tion. Due to the early timing of the test, NTDs cannot be detected with thisprocedure. Abiophysical profile (BPP) of the fetus is performed with ultrasound visu- alization of the fetus combined with a reactive nonstress test to note fetal activ-ity and status. A rating of 2 is a passing score: /H17035Fetal breathing (one or more episodes of 30-second duration in 30 min-utes = 2; less or absent breathing = 0). /H17035Fetal movement of limbs and body (a minimum of 3 body extensionswith return to flexion in 30 minutes = 2; fewer or no movements = 0). /H17035Fetal tone (at least one episode of limb extension with return flexion = 2;slow or no movement, or absence of flexion = 0). /H17035V olume of amniotic fluid surrounding fetus: Amniotic fluid index (AFI)is obtained by measuring fluid in the deepest vertical pocket in the4 quadrants of the uterine area (a minimum of 1 pocket with 2 cm offluid and AFI >5 cm = 2; less fluid or AFI <5 cm = 0). /H17035Reactive fetal heart rate with activity (reactive nonstress test [NST]):More than 2 accelerations of seconds in 20-40minutes = 2; 0-1 acceleration in 20-40 minutes = 0. Treatment If NST is nonreactive, a diagnostic ultrasound, contraction stress test (CST),and BPP may be ordered. If the fetus is viable, immediate delivery is per-formed. WHAT WENT WRONG? A major complication that can occur early in pregnancy is incompetent cervix \u2014the dilation of the cervix without uterine contractions. In this situation4CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 101 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. the cervix is unable to contain the fetus and opens with the weight of the grow- ing fetus, expelling the fetus and other products of conception. This occursaround 20 weeks of gestation. Signs and Symptoms Incompetent cervix may manifest with vaginal drainage or bleeding (possi- bly a gush of fluids as membranes rupture), pelvic pressure, and contractionsand expulsion of the fetus and products of conception. Test Results /H17035Ultrasound may reveal a short cervix (less than 20 mm) indicatingdecreased competence. Treatments /H17035In incompetent cervix, if found prior to fetal expulsion, a cervicalcerclage\u2014a surgical reinforcement\u2014may be performed to prevent pre-mature dilation. The cerclage remains in place until week 37 of gestation.Activity restrictions or bed rest may be ordered. /H17035Treatment for incompetent cervix with partial expulsion of the fetusinvolves a D&C to remove all products of conception\u2014postoperativecare is provided including monitoring for infection or hemorrhage. NURSING INTERVENTIONS 1. Monitor vital signs.2. In case of incompetent cervix, the nurse should: a. Observe for signs of incompetent cervix such as vaginal drainage or bleeding, and reports of pressure with or without contraction. b. Encourage hobbies or other distractions to promote compliance with activity restrictions and bed rest, if ordered. 3. Instruct the client and family regarding activity restrictions, including refraining from sexual intercourse, standing for long periods, or heavylifting. 4. Avoid dehydration, which may stimulate contractions, by promoting reg- ular fluid intake. 5. Instruct the client regarding signs of preterm labor\u2014strong contractions less than 5 minutes apart, rupture of membranes, or perineal pressurewith desire to push\u2014and infection. 6. Arrange for a home health nurse and instruct the client in the use of a home uterine activity monitor, if ordered. 7. Instruct the client on the importance of follow-up visits and care.8. Support the client and family in the emotional crisis related to the loss of a child. Refer for grief counseling, if indicated.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 102 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY The third trimester begins after the 24th week and proceeds until delivery of the newborn. Blood pressure stabilizes and dizziness peaks around week 32,then resolves. The problems of the second trimester related to the pressure ofthe growing fetus; hormone changes, particularly related to back pain; vascularpressures; and gastrointestinal changes are intensified during the final trimester. /H17035Thoracic breathing becomes more common than abdominal breathingand dyspnea may be noted as the pregnancy progresses and the fundusreaches the xiphoid process. /H17035As the enlarging fetus exerts pressure against the diaphragm, the chestcavity may enlarge, with progesterone causing relaxation of joints andligaments. The chest cavity width will increase as the fetal enlargementcauses the cavity height to decrease, thus maintaining the cavity capac-ity and breathing efficiency. /H17035Indigestion/heartburn may be noted, as well as flatulence and constipation. /H17035Dependent edema (swollen ankles) and lower extremity, vulva, and rec-tal varicose veins may develop as the enlarged uterus presses on thefemoral veins.2CHAPTER 6 / Physiologic Changes of Pregnancy 103 1. What symptoms are common in the second trimester of pregnancy? a. Diarrheab. Decreased appetitec. Urinary urgency and frequencyd. Abdominal itching Answer:2. What change in the second trimester may have the greatest impact on the woman's psychological adjustment to the pregnancy? a. The increased skin sensitivity causes the woman to bond more with the fetus. b. The woman can feel the fetal form on her abdomen, making the infant more real. c. The extra burst of energy the woman experiences makes it easier to think about the newborn's birth and joining the family. d. The first experience of fetal movement makes it clearer that the pregnancy and the fetus are truly present.

Lordosis may be noted as the woman tries toadjust to the weight of her stomach and breasts. /H17035Increasing backache is noted as the pregnancy progresses. /H17035Braxton-Hicks contractions are noted and may intensify in preparationfor true labor. TEST RESULTS The nonstress test (NST) is the most commonly used test to evaluate the status of the fetus by measuring fetal heart rate (FHR) during fetal move-ment. An external transducer is applied to the maternal abdomen to moni-tor contractions, and a Doppler is used to monitor FHR. When the mothersenses fetal movement, a tracing of the FHR is marked to allow analysis.Acoustics or vibration and sound may be used to stimulate movement. Thistest is most commonly performed in the third trimester. An NST is consid-ered reactive if, during fetal activity, two or more times during a 20-minute period the FHR accelerates for at least 15 seconds to a rate of 15 beats perminute. An NST is considered nonreactive if the FHR does not accelerate sufficiently with movement or there is no fetal movement in 40 minutes.Further assessment using a contraction stress test (CST) or a BPP shouldbe done. Acontraction stress test (CST) is used to determine the flow of oxy- genated blood through the placenta during a stimulated or induced contraction.The flow is usually decreased slightly with contractions and normally the fetusadapts and tolerates the decrease. If oxygen reserves are limited, fetal hypoxiaand myocardial depression with decreased FHR occurs, indicating that thefetus cannot tolerate the stress of uterine contractions. A baseline of FHR andfetal movement and contractions should be obtained for a 10- to 20-minuteperiod. Then the woman is instructed to brush across her nipples or roll herbreast nipples between her finger and thumb (or a mechanical stimulator maybe applied) to provide stimulation until a contraction is initiated. If oxytocinis used to induce contractions, monitor closely. A negative CST is noted if no late deceleration is noted with 3 contractions of 40 or more seconds in a10-minute period. A positive test shows late decelerations with over half of the contractions, indicating that the fetus is unable to tolerate the stress and as5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 104 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

If the test results are suspicious with less than 50% of the contractions causing late decelerations, or hyper-stimulation occurs with longer (>90 seconds) or more frequent contractions(every 2 minutes) that result in late decelerations, the finding is termed equiv- ocal and further testing is needed. An unsatisfactory finding results if tracing of FHR is poor or the contractions never reach 3 in 10 minutes with 40-sec-ond or longer duration. Nurse Alert Caution the mother to stop when contraction is sensed and to rest for periods between testing to prevent uterine hyperstimulation. Nurse Alert CST is contraindicated in placenta previa, abruption placentae, vagi- nal of unknown origin, premature rupture of the membranes, incom-petent cervix with cerclage intact, abnormal maternal reproductive organs,previous cesarean with vertical incision of the fundus, or history of preterm labor or multiple gestation birth. Review the woman's history carefully. WHAT WENT WRONG? Preterm labor, placenta previa, and abruption placenta may occur late in the second trimester or in the third trimester (see details in Chap. 9). Signs and Symptoms /H17035Vaginal discharge with pink tinge, regular uterine contractions, and cer-vical dilation and effacement prior to the 36th week of gestation indi-cates premature labor. /H17035Vaginal bleeding that is painless as the cervix dilates (placenta previs) oraccompanied by sharp abdominal pain and a rigid uterus (abruption pla-centa) are signs of major complications. Test Results /H17035Ultrasound indicates the location of the placenta or short cervix inpreterm labor. /H17035Fetal fibronectin (fFN) via cervical swab may indicate preterm labor. TREATMENTS /H17035Cerclage is removed after week 37 for women with incompetent cervix. /H17035Maalox or Mylanta may be permitted to relieve indigestion; sodiumbicarbonate is prohibited. /H17035See later chapter for detailed care of other complications.

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 114 OVERVIEW After conception occurs, the zygote progresses to an embryo and then becomes a fetus. Generally, the growth period from fertilization to birth isconsidered to be 2 weeks less than the gestational age or length of preg-nancy calculated from the onset of the most recent regular menstrual periodto the time of birth, 280 days or 40 weeks duration. The postconception ageis calculated to be about 266 days or 91/2 months. At each stage of fetal development, distinct physical changes occur and can be noted uponultrasound examination. The fetus is vulnerable to many factors that canimpair or alter development, particularly in the early stages of develop-ment. Assessment at each stage of fetal development promotes early detec-tion of problems that may arise. Nursing care is directed at promotion ofhealthy fetal development and prevention or reduction of dangerous mater-nal behaviors and fetal exposures that could result in fetal morbidity ormortality. As stated in chapter 4, the fertilized egg is called a zygote. /H17035The first two weeks after conception are called the germinal period, dur-ing which the cells continue to duplicate and the zygote moves throughthe fallopian tubes to the uterus. The first 2 weeks of development areconsidered the preembryonic stage . /H17035The embryonic stage begins at day 15 and proceeds through week 8 or about 56 days. /H17035The final stage is the fetal stage , which continues from the beginning of week 9 through birth (Fig. 7.1).1Cephalocaudal DizygoticDuctus KEY [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 7 / Fetal Development 115 /H17035During the embryonic and fetal stages, the head and back are flexed and length is measured from the top of the head (crown-C) to the bottom ofthe hips (rump-R). /H17035In the fetal stage, as extremities grow longer, the measurement fromcrown to heel (C-H) is also taken. The major fetal development (in postconception weeks) that occurs during the embryonic and fetal stages include the following (Table 7.1) THE EMBRYONIC STAGE From approximately day 10 to day 14 after conception and during the embry- onic stage the germ cell layers, the ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm areformed as membranes from which tissues, organs, and organ systems grow.At this stage the embryo is most vulnerable to cell and tissue damage fromteratogens (agents that can cause damage to a developing fetus such as drugs, infections, or radiation). The ectoderm forms a cylinder-shaped tubethat will form the brain and spinal cord. The gastrointestinal (GI) tract devel-ops from the endoderm and forms another cylinder that attaches to the yolksac. A tube-shaped heart forms outside the body initially, and by the end of the7th week blood cells will circulate through major blood vessels.

This sac is later incorporatedinto the umbilical cord. Around weeks 4 and 5, mesodermal blocks ( somites ) line both sides of the midline of the embryo and provide the foundation to form the vertebrae ofthe spinal column. The bases for the lower jaw, hyoid bone, and larynx aredeveloped in this stage. By week 5 the brain has 5 distinct areas and 10 cra-nial nerve pairs can be noted. By week 6 the heart has most of its major aspectsand fetal circulation is established, and true blood cells are produced by theliver. By the end of week 7 the foundation for all internal and external bodyparts is in place. By the end of week 8, all body structures, organs, and sys-tems are in place. The musculoskeletal frame begins to form. The function ofthese structures will be refined during the remaining months until birth. THE FETAL STAGE During the fetal stage, organ forms and functions are refined. Tooth buds formand the face of the fetus is formed and looks human. The fetal heart rate is 120to 160 beats per minute. Between weeks 12 and 16 the fetus grows rapidlywith musculoskeletal tissue development, which enables movement. By week20 the fetus becomes active and the mother experiences fetal mobility ( quick- ening ). By 24 weeks the fetus has a proportioned, lean body. Amniotic fluid contains a respiratory marker (lecithin) that can be used to determine lungmaturity. The fetus appears to be able to hear and progresses to awareness ofthe environment outside the maternal body. In week 28 the eyes of the fetusbegin to open and close. The brain is formed and a weak suck reflex is pres-ent. By week 32 subcutaneous, brown fat insulation is present. The fetus hasfingernails and toenails in place. By week 36 and beyond the fetal body shapeis round, skin has pink undertones, and fine lanugo is noted on the upper body.Scant vernix caseosa may be present at full term. The immune system is devel-oping and the newborn is protected by antibodies passed from the mother dur-ing this vulnerable period. FETAL CIRCULATION Fetal circulation is designed to allow blood flow from the mother through theplacenta through the fetal body, but bypassing the nonfunctioning fetal lungsas well as the fetal liver. The fetus receives oxygenated blood and nutrientsfrom the mother and sends deoxygenated blood to the mother for gas exchangeto remove carbon dioxide and waste. Blood flows from the placenta to theinferior vena cava and right atrium, then most of the blood flows through theforamen ovale , an opening between the fetal atria, into the left atrium and then into the left ventricle and is pumped out through the aorta to the body. Asmall amount of blood flows from the head and upper extremities into theMaternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 120 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Most blood flows past the lungs and into the aorta and then returns to the placenta through the duc- tus arteriosus , a connection between the pulmonary artery and the aorta that shunts blood past the fetal lungs. The fetal circulation delivers oxygen to the body in a head-to-toe ( cephalo- caudal ) direction, which encourages developmental priority to the brain and heart followed by GI tract and extremities. At birth the flow of fetal circula-tion is altered when the fetal lungs become functional and blood flow musttravel through the lungs for gas exchange. Problems are encountered if fetalheart structures that are designed to shunt blood past the lungs fail to close (seeChap. 12: Newborn Care).CHAPTER 7 / Fetal Development 121 A. B. C. Figure 7.2 A.

MULTIPLE FETUSES Multiple fetuses may develop from separate ova/eggs being fertilized by sep- arate spermatozoa two chorions, and two amnions form. The fetuses are considered fraternal and do not look the same. Multiple fetuses may also develop from one fertilized ovum(maternal/ monozygotic ). The fetuses share the chorion and placenta, are the same sex, and are identical in appearance. The cellular mass must separateinto two or more distinct zygotes for multiple fetuses to develop. If this separationoccurs early, individual amnions and chorions will develop. If the separationoccurs later the embryos will share the chorion but have separate amnion sacs.If the separation occurs even later after the amnion is formed, a rare occurrence,the fetuses will share the same amnion sac. The development of multiplefetuses is similar to that of a single fetus. Congenital anomalies or defects,secondary to exposure to a teratogen noted in one of the fetuses, are commonlyfound in all the multiple fetuses in that pregnancy. DISRUPTION OF FETAL DEVELOPMENT Rh or ABO incompatibility , as discussed in Chap. 3, can occur when the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive. If the fetus is Rh-positivelike the father, upon exposure to the baby's blood the mother can develop anti-bodies that will attack the fetus's blood as a foreign body. The first pregnancy,whether completed to a live birth or ending in an abortion or miscarriage, willsensitize the mother's system and antibodies will be formed, unless the womanwas treated with an Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM), which provides passiveantibody protection against the Rh antigen and prevents the body from produc-ing its own antibodies. If the mother has been sensitized and has not beentreated, the fetus is at risk of having red blood cells destroyed by the mother'santibodies. The fetus may become severely anemic due to red blood celldestruction (hemolysis) and require early delivery (delayed if possible untilafter 36th or 37th week), or intrauterine transfusions or transfusions immedi-ately after birth. The fetus may also develop ascites, subcutaneous edema,increased heart size, or hydramnios (excess amniotic fluid) and require sup-portive treatment. Nursing care is focused on prevention through early assessment for risk and treatment of the woman with each pregnancy. Upon receipt of test results,the nurse should report that the pregnant woman is Rh-negative (indirectCoombs' test is negative, nonsensitized) and fetus is Rh-positive (directCoombs' test is negative) and follow through with RhoGAM treatment asordered. Observation should be continued to determine treatment effectivenessand absence of fetal distress due to incompatibility and damage to fetal redblood cells from maternal antibodies.6Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 122 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Most commonly if the maternal blood type is O (no A or B antigens)and the fetal blood type is A, B, or AB, the fetal antigens are likely to causethe mother to produce antibodies against the fetal blood and hemolysis canoccur in the fetus. The anemia is not as severe as with Rh incompatibility andno treatment is available. Additionally, each pregnancy stands alone; thus, noearlier sensitization will impact the current pregnancy. The newborn is mon-itored upon birth for signs of hyperbilirubinemia which can result from exces-sive red blood cell death and appropriate treatment is provided. Teratogens , anything that can interfere with normal fetal development, can cause varied disruptions in fetal body formation. The impact may vary basedon when and to what degree the exposure occurred, what tissue was mostaffected, and fetal genotype, which determines how vulnerable the fetus is tothe teratogen. The earlier the exposure to the teratogen, the more disruptionoccurs to fetal development. If disruption is severe, the fetus does not surviveand spontaneous abortion occurs. The most common disruptions include thefollowing: /H17035Nutritional deficits can cause decreased brain growth and neural tubedevelopment (spinal cord disruption), coronary heart disease, diabetes,hypertension, and small or disproportionate fetal body development. /H17035Maternal hyperthermia can cause central nervous system (CNS) defectsor failed neural tube closure. /H17035Exposure to substance abuse, infection, or a teratogen can result in var-ied disruptions including mental retardation or body structure malfor-mation depending on the week of exposure, for example: Week 3: Absence of one or more extremities, heart remains outside chest Week 4: Herniation of abdominal structures into umbilical cord (omphalocele ) Week 5: Cataract, small eyeballs (microphthalmia), facial 6: Septal or aortic abnormalities, Week 7: Ventricular septal defect, cleft palate, brachycephalism (short head), characteristics, pulmonary stenosis Week 8: Persistent atrial septum opening, short fingers or toes NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS WHAT WENT WRONG? The neural tube develops into the brain and the spinal cord. A neural tubedefect is the failure of the neural tube to close within 28 days after conceptionin an area of the neural tube or the entire length of the neural tube, resultingin a neurologic disorder in the fetus. 56CHAPTER 7 / Fetal Development 123 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The cause of neural tube defects is unknown; however, there is a link between inadequate intake of folic acid prior to pregnancy and during the firsttrimester. The most common neural tube defects are: /H17035Spina bifida occulta: This is the incomplete closure without the spinalcord or meninges protruding. This patient usually doesn't experienceneurologic dysfunction, although there might be bladder or bowel dis-turbances or weakness in the foot. /H17035Spina bifida cystica: This is the incomplete closure with the spinal cord ormeninges protruding in a sac. There are two types of spina bifida cystica.These are: Myelomeningocele: The sac contains the spinal cord, cerebral spinal fluid, and meninges. This patient usually experiences neurologic dys-function. Meningocele: The sac contains cerebral spinal fluid and the meninges. This patient rarely experiences neurologic dysfunction. /H17035Anencephaly: Cerebral hemispheres of the brain and the top portion ofthe skull. The brain stem is intact, enabling the infant to have cardio-pulmonary functions; however, the infant is likely to die of respiratoryfailure a few weeks after birth. /H17035Encephalocele: Portions of the brain and meninges protrudes in the sac.This patient usually experiences neurologic dysfunction.

Paralysis Hydrocephalus TEST RESULTS /H17035Maternal serum tested for -fetoprotein (MSAFP) serum test: Performed at (high with neural tube defects, anen-cephaly, omphalocele, or gastroschisis (intestines exposed and outside the abdominal wall). /H17035Aminocentesis: Assess if -fetoprotein is in amniotic fluid. This test is performed if the -fetoprotein test is abnormal. /H17035Ultrasound: Assess if there is a neural tube defect or defect in the ventral wall. This test is performed if the -fetoprotein test is abnormal. /H17035Transillumination of the sac: Differentiates between myelomeningocele and meningocele. A meningocele sac does not transilluminate. This testis performed if the sac is present after birth. /H17035CT scan: Assess the presence of a neural tube defect after birth. /H17035X-ray: Assess the presence of a neural tube defect after birth. TREATMENTS /H17035Surgery within 48 hours of birth to close the opening to decrease the riskof infection and prevent spinal cord damage. /H17035Insert a shunt to relieve hydrocephalus. Nurse Alert Surgery does not reverse the disorder. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Prenatal: Encourage the mother to take adequate amounts of folic acid during childbearing years. Explain the disorder and treatment following birth. /H17035After birth: Lay the infant on his or her side to prevent pressure on the sac. Keep the sac covered with a sterile dressing soaked in warmed saline solution to keep the sac moist. Place a strip of plastic below the sac to prevent contamination from urine and stool to prevent infection. Measure head circumference to determine if hydrocephalus develops. Monitor for infection around the sac. Assess for leakage around the sac. Assess bladder and blow function. Assess neurologic signs. Reposition the patient every 2 hours to prevent pressure ulcers and contractures.4663CHAPTER 7 / Fetal Development 125 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Measure head circumference to determine if hydrocephalus develops. Be prepared to insert a straight urinary catheter if the infant is not uri- nating adequately. Perform range of motion exercises to maintain muscle tone. GENETIC ABNORMALITIES Hereditary conditions can be passed on through the genes of the mother, father,or both. When the ovum and spermatozoa join, on occasion either the egg orsperm may have an extra copy of a chromosome (trisomic) totaling 47 chro-mosomes. The most common chromosome that is duplicated is number 21.Down syndrome is the most common condition (trisomy 21). The most com-mon consequence of this anomaly is intellectual retardation. Trisomy 13 and18 may occur, but are both associated with death in the first 3 months of life.Some conditions involve the absence of a chromosome (monosomy), totaling45. Chromosomal structure anomalies may be found in combination with tri-somy conditions. In some cases, after fertilization two different cell lines willdevelop: one with an abnormal chromosomal number and one with a normalnumber. This condition should be suspected if symptoms of Down syndromeare noted but intelligence is normal or almost normal. Sex chromosome anom-alies can occur if the fetus gets an extra X chromosome (Klinefelter\u201447,XXY) or female (Turner\u201445, XO). While individual manifestations of chro-mosomal anomalies may vary, some common signs and symptoms are notedwith the major conditions (Table 7.2). CONGENITAL ANOMALIES Genetic conditions were discussed in Chapter 4 but will be briefly reviewed here. Some congenital anomalies are inherited conditions that occur as a result of adominant gene or recessive gene carried by the mother, father, or both. Theseanomalies could also occur from a sex-linked (X-linked) inheritance. Conditionsthat occur secondary to anemia, hemophilia,5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 126 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Some conditions occur secondary to multi- ple factors combining genes and environment, greater the number of defects thehigher the number of factors impacting the fetus. Such conditions include spinabifida, myelomeningocele, or pyloric stenosis. Congenital heart defects will becovered in Chapter 12 with care of the newborn.CHAPTER 7 / Fetal Development 127 Condition Symptoms Trisomy 21, 18, 13 Men tal retardation, hypotonia, (seizures in trisomy 13); congenital heart disease (see section below for additional data) Trisomy 18 Prominent occiput, low set ears, ptosis, syndactyly Trisomy 18, ears, cleft lip/palate, polydactyly (extra digits) Turner (XO) females No intellectual impairment, perceptual difficulties, low hairline, short stature, excessive nevi (skin pigmentation discoloration), wide chest with spacednipples, no toe nails, fibrous streaked ovaries, underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics, infertility, renal anomalies Klinefelter (XXY) males Mild retardation, gynecomastia, lack of male musculature, underdeveloped secondary sex characteristics, infertile/sterileTABLE 7.2 Common Signs and Symptoms of Major Conditions 1.

ALTERATIONS IN FETAL GROWTH Some pregnancies are identified as high risk because of maternal condition or prenatal exposures that can impact fetal growth. Any condition that could affect maternal nutrition, such as low socioeconomic status, homelessness, or adolescence, or any condition that would disrupt placental delivery ofnutrient-rich blood, such as a small placenta or placenta previa, could causedeficits in fetal nutrition. Exposure to environmental factors such as toxins,X-rays, or hyperthermia, or to infections such as toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus (TORCH) canincrease the risk of fetal growth disturbance. Conditions that impact mater-nal blood flow would similarly cause a disruption of placental blood flow, forexample, maternal heart disease, substance abuse (including tobacco or alco-hol use), sickle cell anemia, lupus erythematosis, or phenylketonuria (PKU).Premature newborns (less than 37 weeks) are likely to be small for gesta-tional age (SGA), and postmature newborns (greater than 42 weeks) may belarge for gestational age (LGA). Newborns with either designation are athigher risk for complications than newborns that are full term (37-42 weeks)and appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Neonatal risk charting of weeksof gestation and weight in grams has been used to determine the likelihoodof morbidity, with premature birth and low weight contributing to a highdegree of morbidity and mortality. The evaluation of newborn weight willrequire consideration of the race of the newborn and standard birth weightsfor that population. PRETERM NEWBORN WHAT WENT WRONG? A newborn is considered preterm if it is born before completion of the full 37weeks of gestation. These infants often also have low birth weight (LBW),and occurrence of premature, LBW infants is higher in adolescents and in theAfrican American population. The primary problems with premature LBWinfants result from immature systems with decreased function. The stress ofbirth is a major challenge that some premature infants do not survive. A num-ber of problems challenge premature infants. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS, AND TEST RESULTS Nurse Alert When evaluating developmental accomplishments, the newborn should be assessed based on chronological age from expected date of birth from conception, not actual date of birth. 355Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 128 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Respiratory system: The premature newborn has low amounts of surfactant, resulting in alveoli that collapse easily and leading to poor gas exchange anddecreased oxygenation, hypoxia, and poor activity tolerance due tolow oxygen reserves. Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) can resultand requires intensive treatment (see Chap. 12: Newborn Care). Increased flow of blood back into the lungs through the ductus arte- riosus, which fails to close after birth because oxygen levels andprostaglandin E levels do not increase sufficiently to stimulate vaso-constriction of the ductus arteriosus. A resulting pulmonary conges-tion, carbon dioxide retention, bounding femoral pulses, andincreased respiratory effort are noted. Pulmonary dysfunction canbecome chronic. Apnea of prematurity (cessation of breathing for up to 20 seconds or less than 20 seconds, accompanied by bradycardia, cyanosis, or pal-lor) may be noted secondary to immature neurologic control of res-pirations, or obstruction from structural collapse or secretions. /H17035Poor temperature control: High body surface for low body weight, which provides high loss of heat with lower heat production resulting in newborn hypothermia. Decreased subcutaneous fat, resulting in minimum insulation and increased loss of body heat from blood vessels that are close to theskin surface. Thin skin with high permeability, leading to water loss and heat loss. Premature newborn posture with less flexion and greater extension of limbs leads to greater exposure of body surface area and greaterheat loss. The newborn's ability to vasoconstrict blood vessels is decreased, causing a decreased ability to conserve body heat. /H17035Gastrointestinal (GI) problems: Aspiration due to poor gag, sucking, and swallowing reflexes caused by a weak esophageal sphincter. High caloric and fluid demand with small size but small stomach capacity requiring frequent feedings and supplements. Increased metabolic rate and oxygen demands due to energy required for sucking, and low activity tolerance and easy fatigue. Limited ability to process nutrients including conversion of amino acids, absorption of fats (low bile salts), or digestion of lactose(needs simple sugars). Calcium and phosphorus levels are low because stores are usually built up in the last trimester. Bone demineralization may be noted. Decreased tissue perfusion to the GI tract or hypoxemia at birth may result in feeding intolerance and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Decreased renal function: Low glomerular filtration rate due to low renal blood flow and hypoxia resulting in oliguria or anuria Limited ability of the preterm infant's kidneys to concentrate urine, leading to excretion of excess fluid and risk for dehydration Excretion of glucose by the immature kidneys, leading to hypo- glycemia Decreased ability of the kidneys to buffer, with excess excretion of bicarbonate and resulting metabolic acidosis Decreased ability of premature kidneys to excrete drugs, leading to toxicity of drugs at lower levels and high susceptibility to nephro-toxic drugs /H17035Altered immune system: High risk for infection because passive immunity gained from mother usually is received by the fetus in the last trimester. Preterm skin surface provides less defense against invading organisms. IgA, a significant immunoglobulin needed by the newborn that is acquired through breast milk only, does not cross the placenta;thus, the premature newborn must have breast milk to gain thisprotection. /H17035Neurologic system: Myelination of nerves occurs beginning with the second trimester until birth. The closer to term the fetus is, the less disruption of neu-rologic function is noted. Intracranial hemorrhage and intraventricular hemorrhage (with pos- sible hydrocephalus) are the most common complications of preterminfants. The fragile vasculature of the brain easily ruptures in thepresence of hypoxia, as commonly occurs with birth asphyxia orbirth trauma. Preterm newborns have different response patterns than term new- borns with fewer reactive periods, decreased responsiveness, andweaker muscle tone. The pattern can be used to determine the besttimes for feeding and bonding. TREATMENTS /H17035Radiant warmer or incubator to assist with temperature control. /H17035Dietary support with breast milk and special preterm formula with extraprotein and calories. Additional support includes the following: A diet high in polyunsaturated fat (well tolerated by preterm new- born) Multivitamin supplementation of vitamins A, D, E, and iron Calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D supplements for bone mineral- ization6Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 130 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE (SGA) WHAT WENT WRONG? A fetus is considered small for its gestational age if its weight is at or less than 10thpercentile. The SGA newborn is also described as having experienced intrauter-ine growth restriction (IUGR) caused by maternal factors, placental factors, orfetal conditions. The major risk factors for SGA include smoking, drug or alco-hol use, multiple gestations, gestational hypertension, maternal malnutrition, dis-ease or infection, decreased placental perfusion (such as with a small placenta orplacenta previa), fetal infection (such as rubella), or congenital anomalies.

A fetus is considered excessively large ( macrosomic ) if its weight is above the 90th percentile or exceeds 4,000 g. The primary contributors to macrosomicfetal development are maternal diabetes and post-term pregnancy. A fetus thatis LGA is at risk for several conditions: /H17035Birth injury to fetal clavicles due to shoulder dystocia (inability of the fetal shoulder to descend under the maternal symphysis pubis duringbirth) Conditions associated withmaternal diabetes /H17035Erb-Duchenne paralysis secondary to injury at birth SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Fetal size assessed during Leopold maneuvers indicates LGA. /H17035Labor dystocia (dysfunctional labor ) is noted with failure of labor to progress. /H17035FHR may reveal distress during contraction related to shoulder dystocia. /H17035Newborn will have increased body fat. /H17035If the infant is from a diabetic mother, cardiomegaly may be noted.

POSTMATURE NEWBORN Infants born after 42 weeks of gestation are deemed to be postmature. While these babies may be large for their gestational age, most will be AGA and reveal few symptoms. Postmaturity syndrome may be noted in some newborns who exhibit hypoglycemia due to depletion of glycogen stores, oligohydramnios(decreased amniotic fluid), in utero hypoxia evidenced by meconium aspira-tion, polycythemia due to increased blood cells in response to hypoxia, andseizures, as well as cold stress due to poor development or loss of subcuta-neous fat. The prolonged pregnancy contributes to aging of the placenta withdecreased functioning and decreased fetal nutrition and oxygenation.

CONCLUSION Fetal development generally proceeds in an orderly fashion, moving fromconception and cell division to the formation of the brain, heart, and otherbody organs and structures. Early development is critical for structure forma-tion, and late development is important for the full function and maturity oforgan systems. Fetal exposure to trauma from toxic substances or unfavor-able conditions such as malnutrition or hypoxia can result in damage to thefetus that is irreversible. Key points to remember include the following: /H17035The stages of fetal growth include the preembryonic stage or germinalperiod, during which cell duplication and uterine implantation occurs;the embryonic stage, during which the body and extremities are formed;and the fetal stage, which includes the growth of the fetus until birth. /H17035The length and weight of the embryo and fetus should increase eachperiod with increasing organ function and structure refinement. /H17035Adipose tissue increases in late pregnancy to provide fat stores and new-born insulation. /H17035Fetal circulation allows blood to flow from the placenta through theheart, but bypasses the nonfunctioning lungs through openings designed toshunt blood from one side of the heart to the other and out to the fetal body. /H17035Multiple fetuses proceed through the development process as one fetusdoes, but maternal nutrients, and in some cases placenta and chorion,are shared, thus placing a higher demand on the mother and increasingthe risks for problems in fetal development. /H17035Rh or ABO incompatibility can cause maternal development of antibod-ies to the fetal blood. These antibodies can attack the fetal blood, result-ing in hemolysis and severe newborn anemia. An Rh immune globulin(RhoGAM) should be given to the unsensitized mother after each preg-nancy to prevent antibody production. No preventive treatment is avail-able for ABO incompatibility, and transfusions should be available forthe newborn, in case the need arises. /H17035Teratogens can interfere with fetal development. The earlier the exposureof the developing fetus to the toxin, the more severe the damage that canresult.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Nutritional deficits, hyperthermia, and teratogen exposure can impact varied organs depending upon the stage of fetal development in whichthe exposure occurs. /H17035Neural tube defect can occur if incomplete closure occurs with or with-out spinal cord or meninges protrusion. Nursing care focuses on preven-tion of injury or infection until repair is performed, then postoperativecare for the newborn and family. /H17035Genetic anomalies can occur secondary to hereditary or chromosomal abnor-malities. Extra chromosomes or missing chromosomes can result in alter-ations in body structure form and function, including altered mental ability. /H17035Genetic anomalies commonly involve multisystem impacts; some effectsmay not be evident at birth or in the early infancy period. /H17035Alterations in fetal growth may occur as a result of preterm birth andintrauterine growth restriction due to maternal, placental, or fetal condi-tions resulting in a small for gestational age (SGA) newborn; excessexposure to high glucose levels resulting in the birth of a large for ges-tational age (LGA) newborn; or post-term birth. /H17035Excess or inadequate gestational time or fetal weight can result in diffi-culty in fetal tolerance to the birth process as well as complications forthe newborn due to altered body system function. /H17035Nursing care when fetal development alterations are present includesassisting the family in adjusting to the altered newborn function and pro-moting family support of optimal newborn and child development andmanagement of complications, if applicable.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 136 FINAL CHECKUP? 1.

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 140 OVERVIEW The woman and family preparing for the birth of a child face a number of questions and anxieties. To determine the care and learning needs of thewoman and family, a thorough assessment is performed, followed by prepa-ration of a plan to provide information and instruction related to the lifestyleadjustments and new skills needed to ensure a healthy pregnancy, birth, andadjustment to parenting a newborn. Issues will range from change in nutri-tional needs to choice of pain relief measures during the labor process. Thefamily-centered approach requires that the expectant mother and her family orsupport system be included in the teaching and support provided by the nurse. ASSESSMENT A prenatal assessment will provide data regarding the expectant mother's general health and any potential problems related to the pregnancy and adjust-ment to the newborn (including physiologic, socioeconomic, and emotionalproblems). Several of the issues the pregnant woman will face were discussedwith the physiologic changes of pregnancy in Chapter 6. Prenatal care encom-passes general health measures, particularly addressing chronic illnesses andnutritional support, needed to maximize maternal health and meet fetal needs.Decision making regarding choices of caregivers, location and type of delivery,and desired comfort measures, in addition to the initial preparation for thecare of a newborn, will be addressed during the prenatal period. PRENATAL CARE The primary location for prenatal care is frequently a community health department, clinic, or doctor's/certified nurse midwife's office. Educationalmaterials are available for the client and family on the Internet, in addition21Anorexia nervosa Bulimia nervosaEffleurageEpidural block Maternal parityPica Pudendal blockRecommended dietary allowanceSpinal block KEY TERMS Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Home health care may be available, and needed, for women who have difficulty accessing health care,and it may also be needed in high-risk pregnancy situations in which bed restis required. Among other client-specific measures, prenatal assessments and care include addressing the following: /H17035Current history of concerns, particularly related to pregnancy. /H17035Assessment data including vital signs, weight, and urine specimen. /H17035Tests for fetal assessment (Doppler pulse, ultrasound, etc.) if indicated.The woman and family may have an initial look at the fetus and hearthe fetal heartbeat. /H17035Cervical examination that may be performed, if indicated. /H17035Nutritional habits, pre-pregnancy and current (including craved sub-stances such as starch or dirt/clay), should be assessed as a baseline fornutrition teaching. Care of the father and family will include explaining the common issues in pregnancy and answering any questions. Using measures such as anempathy belly to help the support individuals understand what the expectantmother may be experiencing so that they can anticipate and better meet maternalneeds is an effective strategy. Classes are available for providing the motherand family with information and teaching related to coping with pregnancyand preparation for delivery and newborn care. Determining the readiness ofthe support system members for the challenges, both physical and emotional,related to pregnancy, and for the onset of labor and the birth experience, allowsthe nurse to plan appropriate teaching to prepare them. Discussions aboutthe father's and family members' concerns about choices of delivery measures,or more personal issues such as sexual activity during pregnancy or choiceof breast-feeding or bottle-feeding of the newborn promotes their involve-ment in the pregnancy experience and increases support for the expectantwoman. Siblings often have questions and concerns related to pregnancy, the impact of the maternal pregnancy experience and the newborn on the familyas a whole, and their role in the new family structure in particular. Prenataleducation should allow time for interaction with family members, particularlysiblings. Clear communication of needs and expectations helps the siblingsand other family members be the needed support resources for the expectantmother and father and promotes healthy family function. Cultural concerns include addressing practices and beliefs that may be different from those of the health-care provider but are important to theexpectant family. Communication difficulties should be anticipated secondaryto language barriers, and an interpreter should be provided when indicated. Ifindicated by cultural norms and patient preference, only female caregivers 3661CHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 141 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. should be allowed to touch the expectant mother. If culture dictates, and as approved and requested by the mother, the head of the family should beincluded in information giving and decision-making activities. Unless pro-hibited by best practice and client safety, cultural preferences and taboosshould be acknowledged and adhered to. Assess any substances the expectantmother ingests or is exposed to in order to determine if there may be poten-tial harm to the fetus or mother, and discuss any need to alter or eliminate aspecific cultural practice to ensure maternal and fetal safety. NUTRITION NEEDS The first trimester may present nutritional concerns due to nausea and vom-iting as the mother adjusts to hormone shifts alternating with intense hungerdue to fetal nutrition needs. A daily multivitamin regimen may reduce therisk of nutritional deficit due to nausea/vomiting. Alternative medicine usedto treat nausea includes ginger, and pyridoxine (vitamin B 6) or over-the- counter antihistamines (with permission of the care provider) may be rec-ommended. A steroid may be used to treat severe nausea and vomiting, butthe danger to the fetus often outweighs the benefits. Instruct the woman tonotify her health-care provider if vomiting occurs more than once daily or ifdehydration (dry lips/mucous membranes, minimal dark urine) occurs. Anantiemetic, such as promethazine (Phenergan) may be ordered but should beavoided if possible. Nutrition assessment should determine issues related to maternal eating including food habits, culture, economics, and knowledge level, as well aswillingness to alter habits to maximize health. Additional considerations thatmay impact nutritional status during pregnancy include the following: /H17035Nutritional status prior to pregnancy. /H17035Maternal parity: Number and interval between previous pregnancies and outcome of pregnancy will impact maternal nutrition need. /H17035Maternal age: Adolescent expectant mothers will have growth needs inaddition to the increased nutrition needs from the pregnancy. Erratic teeneating habits could result in insufficient nutrients for the mother andfetus. Planning ways to meet nutritional needs while maintaining teenactivities with peers (nutritious snacks, healthy choices from fast foodmenus) will promote compliance with a healthy diet. /H17035Stage of pregnancy: In early pregnancy rapid cell growth means poornutritional supply could result in permanent damage to the growingfetus. /H17035Essential dietary element intake must be increased during pregnancy andlactation. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) and adequate intake (AI) are increased for pregnant and lactating females. 4Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 142 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Maternal weight gain is expected due to the increase in fetal size, amni- otic fluid production, uterus expansion, blood volume increase, breasttissue growth, and increased maternal stores. /H17035Weight gain varies by trimester with the following: 1.6-2.3 kg gain in the first trimester. 0.5 kg/wk weight gain during the second and third trimesters. Weight gain is a little higher for underweight women. Weight gain should be lower (0.3 kg/wk) for overweight women. In a multiple fetus pregnancy, weight gain is higher (0.7 kg/wk for twins). /H17035Insufficient maternal weight gain has been noted to result in pretermbirth and related newborn distress, and small-for-gestational-age/low-birth-weight babies. /H17035Maternal obesity can predispose the pregnant mother to a higher risk ofpregnancy-related complications, such as spontaneous abortion,preeclampsia, and diabetes, in addition to increasing the risk for fetalabnormalities. In addition, children of obese mothers are more likely tobe obese. Weight gain should be monitored carefully since obesity pre-disposes a woman to excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Maternalobesity and excessive weight gain are associated with large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies. Low-calorie diets are not encouraged during pregnancyfor obese women since adequate intake is necessary for fetal health.Instead, the desired weight gain is modified and a healthy diet is encouragedwith a variety of foods from the food pyramid. /H17035On average, calories should be increased 300 kcal/day during the secondand third trimesters. Carbohydrates and protein intake are increasedslightly, and fat should remain no more than 30% of the daily intake. /H17035Mineral intake should be increased to meet maternal and fetal needs: Calcium and phosphorus are needed for fetal bone and teeth miner- alization. If an adequate supply is not available, the mother mightsuffer deficits as the needs of the fetus are met. Iodine (to prevent cretinism occurrence) is needed in acceptable amounts. An adequate supply is provided through the use of iodized salt. Sodium is needed for metabolism and fluid regulation. Adequate intake is seldom problematic, and excessive sodium should beavoided through elimination of high-salt snacks and added salt asfood is eaten. Zinc is needed for protein metabolism and DNA/RNA synthesis. Meat, poultry, seafood, whole grains, and legumes should be con-sumed to provide dietary zinc. Magnesium is needed for cellular metabolism. Milk, whole grains, dark green vegetables, nuts, and legumes should be consumed to pro-vide dietary magnesium.CHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 143 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Iron needs increase significantly during pregnancy to provide for fetal and maternal production of blood cells. Iron deficiency ane-mia can result from low iron stores and the high demand for ironduring pregnancy. Lean meats; dark green, leafy vegetables; eggs;and whole grain or enriched bread or cereals. as well as driedfruits, legumes, shellfish, and molasses are good sources of iron.Iron supplements are often prescribed, but the gastrointestinal(GI) distress from iron may make iron supplements difficult tomaintain. The use of iron salt could provide the needed increasein iron while reducing sodium from regular salt use to seasonfood. Nurse Alert Milk and caffeine may interfere with iron absorption, so supple- ments should be taken with water. Support to minimize GI distress by recommending the mother eat vegetables and fruit to minimize constipation. Vitamins: ADEK, fat-soluble vitamins, are critical for cell growth, night vision, and fetal eye development. Danger lies in excessiveADEK intake, thus monitoring is important. Symptoms of vitaminE and K excess include nausea and GI upset; dry, cracked skin; andhair loss. Symptoms of vitamin D toxicity include thirst, appetiteloss, vomiting, weight loss, irritability, weight loss, and high bloodcalcium levels. Vitamin E is an antioxidant and beneficial forenzymatic and metabolic reactions; however, excessive vitamin Ehas been associated with newborn coagulation abnormalities. Thussupplements for vitamins ADEK must be used carefully. Water-soluble vitamins (vitamin C, B vitamins, and folic acid) are important for the formation of connective tissue and vascu-lature (vitamin C); coenzyme factors such as cell regulation, glu-cose oxidation, and energy metabolism (vitamins B 1, B2, B6, and B12); and growth, reproduction, and lactation, as well as preven- tion of megaloblastic anemia (folic acid). The need for thesevitamins increases with the need for increased calories andenergy. /H17035Vegetarians, including lacto-ovo vegetarians (who include milk, dairy,and eggs in their vegetable/fruit diet) or vegans who eat no meat or ani-mal byproducts, must watch their diets closely to ensure adequate pro-vision of protein, B vitamins, and sufficient calories since vegetablesare filling and low in calories, so total caloric intake could be insufficientfor the needs of pregnancy. Additional calcium and vitamin D supple-ments may be prescribed to ensure adequate supply.

Nurse Alert Caution mothers to avoid fish and shellfish that are high in mercury and to eat small portions of seafood that is low in mercury. Artifi cial sweeteners that have clearance through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)are safe for use by the pregnant woman. Foods might contain salmonella, liste- riosus (bacterium found in refrigerated substances such as unpasteurized milk, and some meat, poultry, and seafood), or hepatitis E (particularly in raw meat); thus, proper cleaning and cooking temperatures are critical. Eating disorders such as binge and purge eating (bulimia nervosa), or severely limited food intake due to altered self-image as being fat (anorexianervosa), can result in insufficient caloric intake and threaten the health of thechild. Pica (intake of nonfoods such as clay or dirt due to cravings) can alsoresult in inadequate food intake as well as iron deficiency anemia if ironabsorption is disrupted. The nurse must be nonjudgmental and work with thefamily to avoid cultural practices that place the mother or fetus in jeopardy. Key points in maternal nutrition include the following: /H17035The woman should eat regularly, 3 regular meals or 6 small meals each day. /H17035The mother should eat a well-balanced, nutritious diet with a variety offoods that provide the recommended dietary allowance of nutrientsadjusted for age and maternal size. Additional calories and nutrients areneeded if multiple fetuses are present. /H17035Inadequate weight gain can result in a small-for-gestational-age infant,and excessive weight gain can result in excessively large newborn sizeand weight. /H17035Fruit and vegetables provide fiber in the diet and will reduce the inci-dence of constipation. /H17035Iron-rich foods will increase maternal and fetal iron stores. /H17035A daily multivitamin is prescribed to ensure that needed nutrients areprovided. /H17035Weight loss dieting is prohibited to avoid reducing nutrients to the fetus. /H17035Adolescent females require additional nutrients for maternal growth aswell as fetal development. /H17035Monitor dietary intake and provide counseling to avoid intake of clay,starch, or other craved nonfood substances (pica), which will reduceneeded nutritional intake. /H17035Monitor laboratory tests that indicate adequacy of nutrition, such ashematocrit and hemoglobin. /H17035Vegetarians must choose foods to avoid the potential for low protein,iron, zinc, vitamin B 12, and calcium since meat and animal products are the usual sources of these nutrients. /H17035Cultural preferences should be respected when planning a diet for thepregnant female.44CHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 145 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

ACTIVITY Exercise provides multiple benefits for the female during pregnancy. The balance of activity and rest is important to reap the benefits and avoid exhaus- tion or harm from high-risk activity. Specific added exercises for the abdom- inal and pelvic muscles can be beneficial in preparation for labor and delivery. /H17035Exercise should be regular, half an hour each day. /H17035Low impact exercise reduces pressure on the trunk that may be causedby weight-bearing exercises such as jogging. /H17035Swimming or walking provides good cardiovascular benefits and stress relief. /H17035Hydration is important, particularly in hot weather. Drink water regu-larly and avoid getting overheated or excessively tired. /H17035If unable to talk while exercising, slow the pace and intensity to remainwithin a comfortable level. /H17035Do not use a hot tub or sauna, which could cause vasodilation and resultin cardiovascular compromise with hypotension and fainting. /H17035Do not exercise alone. In the event of complications or injury, assistancemay be needed. /H17035Kegel exercises help to strengthen the pelvic muscles used in bearingdown during delivery. /H17035Back exercises, including the pelvic tilt, are beneficial in reducing backpain common to pregnancy. Activity during labor and prior to birth may include ambulating, sitting in a rocking chair, showering or bathing, or sitting or lying on the bed. If themembrane has ruptured, and the fetus is not engaged, ambulation may be lim-ited to prevent cord prolapse. 5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 146 1.

CHILDBIRTH/DELIVERY OPTIONS When the expectant mother and family begin to adjust to the concept of pregnancy, decisions are made about the plan for childbirth. There are many options for an uncomplicated delivery, and even when a surgical delivery must be performed, there are often options regarding some aspects of the experience,for example, the timing, degree of sedation, and presence of support persons.The expectant mother and family will work with the primary care provider andthe nurse to determine the delivery experience that best fits their family, com-munity resources, and in some cases insurance plan or economic resources. The expectant mother and family may choose the traditional hospital ward for labor and delivery, a birthing center, or some may choose to deliverat home. Many hospitals have labor rooms and separate delivery rooms thatare similar to operating rooms. Some hospital facilities have regular patientrooms that are equipped to support labor and delivery, as well as the postpar-tum mother with a newborn living in the room with her. The birthing roommay be decorated like a bedroom at home, and a birthing bed or birthing chairmay be present for use. The facility may allow for the support person to sleepin the room as well. In some facilities, large baths are available for a waterbirth, if desired by the expectant mother and family. Positions for delivery may vary based on the preference of the mother, rec- ommendations from the health-care provider, and facilities available to sup-port position choice. Generally, any position that allows gravity to help thedescent of the fetus is acceptable, so the preference of the mother will gener-ally dominate. Positions during birth may include kneeling, squatting, lyingon her side, lying on her back on a birthing bed, sitting up in a birthing chair,or positioned on hands and knees. A woman may change positions multipletimes prior to the actual birth of the child. PAIN MANAGEMENT Because any medication that enters the mother's bloodstream usually entersthe fetal system and affects the fetus, the choice of pain relief measure duringdelivery is a critical one. Some mothers choose to have a natural deliverywithout medication. Alternative measures are used to minimize discomfortand support is used to help the mother cope with the pain of labor during thedelivery. Varied approaches to birth are available: /H17035Leboyer is an approach to delivery that focuses on minimizing thetrauma of fetal transition to extrauterine life by providing a calming envi-ronment. Water births are included in the strategies used. /H17035 The Bradley method uses abdominal breathing and general relaxation, promotes partner involvement and support for the mother, and emphasizesnatural childbirth without medication. The Dick-Read method uses controlled626CHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 147 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. breathing with partner support and progressive relaxation to consciously relax all muscles except the uterus for a less stressful labor. The Lamazemethod focuses on partner-coached breathing and panting with relax-ation using a focal point for concentration during labor. Relaxation is akey element in most childbirth methods and aids in pain relief measuresbecause anxiety and muscle tension can increase the pain experienced bythe mother. Some measures used for pain management include the following: /H17035Effleurage: Light stroking of the abdomen in a circular pattern with the fingertips by the woman or a support person. /H17035Deep pressure over the back can relieve back discomfort. /H17035Relaxation exercises: Lying down and progressively tightening andrelaxing body parts from head to toe. Variations include touch relaxation,which involves the support person providing comforting touch; and dis-association relaxation, which involves exercises that help the woman focuscontractions on one body part (uterus) while relaxing other body parts. /H17035Breathing exercises are taught to the mother to promote effective oxy-genation of the mother and fetus during labor by controlling rapid, irreg-ular breathing due to pain. Deep breathing can also increase relaxation,focus the woman, and distract her from the pain as she performs thistask. It also helps the woman to regain a sense of control at a time whenshe may feel powerless against the labor. /H17035Pharmacologic pain intervention may include a variety of approaches. The mother should understand the medication being provided, the effectof the medication, the impact of the medication on the fetus, alternatives,and associated safety instructions such as sitting up slowly or remainingin bed to avoid an accidental fall. Epidural block: Involves injection of anesthesia into the epidural space, which blocks pain reception from the lower body, thus blockingthe pains of labor. Opioids may be injected as well to control the pain. Nurse Alert Provide fluids prior to epidural placement and monitor for mater- nal hypotension, which might occur. Contraindications to an epidural includeinfection at the site of needle puncture, blood coagulopathies, increasedintracranial pressure, medication allergy, or maternal hypotension. Epiduralblock may be given as an infusion regulated to control for pain. If pain occurseven with continuous infusion (breakthrough pain), additional pain medica- tion may be needed. Spinal block involves the anesthesia agent being injected into the spinal fluid. This can be used for a vaginal or cesarean birth. Rapidpain control is achieved; however, hypotension can occur leading tofetal compromise from hypoxia.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 148 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Nurse Alert The mother cannot feel the uterine contraction or the urge to push after a spinal block, so the nurse must monitor contractions and instruct themother when to bear down. If the mother is unable to push, forceps may be needed to assist in the delivery of the baby. Combined spinal-epidural block can reduce the total level of med- ication introduced into the maternal system but allow for greatermobility by the laboring woman. Pudendal block is injection of anesthesia transvaginally to block the pain signal from the pudendal nerve, resulting in relief from pain fromthe structures in the pelvic region. Pain from uterine contractions is stillfelt. Maternal hypotension does not occur and no fetal impact is noted,but hematoma, sciatic nerve trauma, or rectal perforation may occur. Local anesthesia: Usually injected at the time of delivery to allow for episiotomy with minimal discomfort. General anesthesia: May be needed for cesarean delivery, but the impact is great on the fetus, thus this method is avoided with a high-risk fetus. Systemic pain medication may be administered during labor to reduce maternal discomfort and promote rest between contractions.Many systemic medications cross the placental barrier and thus willimpact the fetus. Since liver function affects the metabolism of themedication, the dose provided to the fetus will remain for a period oftime due to the fetus' immature liver function. Opiate-based medica-tions are avoided if the mother has a history of or is suspected to havedrug dependence. Guidelines in the use of systemic medication, if themother provides informed consent, include the following: Maternal and fetal statuses are stable: /H17034Maternal vital signs are within normal range. /H17034Fetal heart rate (FHR) is 110-160 bpm with variability and no late decelerations. /H17034Fetus is at term and demonstrating acceleration with movement. /H17035Medication should be administered after labor is well established withadequate dilation and effacement of the cervix and regular contractions.If provided too soon, labor can be lengthened. If the pain medication isprovided too late, it will be less beneficial for the mother and will resultin the birth of a sedated newborn. /H17035One side effect of pain medications is sedation. This can help the motherto relax and rest between contractions; however, the medication and sideeffect is also passed to the fetus, thus effort is made to use the smallestamount possible to allow maximum maternal comfort with minimumfetal sedation and minimum decrease of labor progression. Maternal vitalsigns, FHR, cervical status (dilation, position, effacement, consistency),and contraction pattern are assessed prior to and after medication is given.CHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 149 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHILDBIRTH CLASSES Prenatal education is critical to assist the expectant female and family in understanding and coping with the pregnancy and delivery experience, and in preparation for care of a newborn. The nurse's role includes assessment of knowledge, planning needed, teaching, and referral to childbirth classes forexperiences to prepare the woman and support persons for labor and delivery.Prenatal education should include the following: /H17035Changes during pregnancy and accompanying discomforts. /H17035Preventative and relief measures to maximize maternal comfort. /H17035Diet and exercise planning to promote a healthy pregnancy and a positivelabor and delivery process. /H17035Previous birth experience could impact maternal learning needs posi-tively or negatively depending on the type of experience. Do not assumethat the mother knows everything because of previous pregnancy. /H17035If prior experience was negative, reassure the mother that every experi-ence proceeds differently and address any concerns.

CONCLUSION Preparation of the expectant mother and family for the pregnancy, birth, and parenting experience provides the basis for a healthy delivery and positive family transition to newborn care. Key points discussed in the chapter include the following: /H17035A family-centered approach to childbirth preparation involves educa-tion and support for the expectant mother and family, including siblings. /H17035Assessment should include maternal health and habits that may impactthe pregnancy, support systems, and the knowledge of the mother andfamily, as well as concerns. /H17035Cultural beliefs and practices related to the pregnancy and deliveryshould be respected and complied with when no danger to the mother orfetus is present. /H17035Nutrition is critical for the mother and fetus to promote healthy fetalgrowth and development without harm to the maternal nutrition status.Increased amounts of key nutrients should be ingested daily to supportfetal development. /H17035Adolescent pregnancy presents challenges to nutritional support andrequires planning and teaching to support adolescent and fetal growthand development needs. /H17035Desirable maternal weight gain is adjusted based on age, pre-pregnancyweight, and number of fetuses. Inadequate or excessive weight gainshould be avoided due to risk factors for preterm birth, restricted orexcessive fetal growth, or maternal complications. A well-balanced mealplan with 3 to 6 meals per day is optimal. /H17035Eating disorders and nonfood cravings can compromise maternalnutritional intake and fetal nutrition. Teaching and, if needed, refer-ral for counseling should be provided to guide the mother to optimalnutrition. /H17035Exercise can be beneficial for the expectant mother for stress relief,health maintenance, back pain reduction, and in preparation for laborand delivery. /H17035Activity should be moderate and low impact, and caution should betaken to avoid fatigue and injury. Ambulation is limited after the mem-branes rupture to avoid cord prolapse. /H17035Multiple delivery options exist and maternal and family preference, inaddition to available resources and health considerations, will impactthe delivery choice. /H17035Pain management is an important aspect of promoting an effective andpositive labor and delivery experience. Use of non-pharmacologic meas-ures, in addition to pharmacologic measures, can provide the most effec-tive and beneficial pain control for the mother with minimal negativeCHAPTER 8 / Childbirth Preparation 153 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 158 OVERVIEW Complications of pregnancy can occur at any stage, beginning with fertiliza- tion and through birth. Early diagnosis of a risk factor for a complication or the early onset of the complication can lead to early treatment and prevention of damage to the mother or fetus. Often the cause of the complication is not known, but many associated con- ditions can provide an opportunity to anticipate the condition and prevent orminimize the negative consequences. ECTOPIC PREGNANCY (EP) WHAT WENT WRONG? In ectopic pregnancy the sperm fertilizes the ovum, but the transition fromthe fallopian tube to the uterus is interrupted and the zygote is implanted out-side of the uterus, usually in the tube. The causes may vary but any conditionthat results in damage to the tubes including pelvic inflammatory disease(PID), endometriosis, prior surgery, exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), orthe presence of an intrauterine device (IUD) could contribute to ectopic preg-nancy. Prognosis is poor for the embryo, which cannot grow to term, andguarded for the mother if the ectopic pregnancy is not terminated before thetube ruptures and hemorrhage occurs. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Missed menses. /H17035Sudden lower quadrant stabbing pain on one side of the abdomen. /H17035Vaginal bleeding may or may not be present: Scant dark spotting (mayindicate rupture has occurred; however, bleeding into the peritoneummay occur in some cases). /H17035Symptoms of early pregnancy may be reported: Breast changes, nausea, etc. /H17035Nausea and vomiting may increase if rupture occurs. /H17035Shoulder pain may be reported: Referred pain from irritation of thediaphragm or phrenic nerve by blood. /H17035Hypotension, tachycardia, and pallor may be noted if rupture occurs sec-ondary to bleeding and shock. TEST RESULTS /H17035Hemoglobin and hematocrit may be low if bleeding occurs. /H17035Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is elevated, confirming preg-nancy. /H17035Progesterone level is elevated. /H17035Ultrasound reveals an empty womb. /H17035White blood cell (WBC) count elevated.221 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. TREATMENTS /H17035Methotrexate is administered to stop cell division and enlargement of the zygote to prevent fallopian tube rupture and spare the fallopian tube. /H17035Salpingostomy (surgical excision of a portion of or entire fallopian tube) Linear salpingostomy to remove unruptured ectopic pregnancy and save the fallopian tube Laproscopic salpingostomy to remove entire tube (if rupture has occurred) Drug Alert Side effects of methotrexate include stomatitis and suppression of blood cell production, thus monitor for oral lesions, anemia, thrombocytopenia, bleeding, and infection. Nurse Alert Instruct the client that birth control should be used while on methotrexate, and caution the client that hair loss will occur and to prepare for alternate styles to maintain self-esteem. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Monitor the client closely for signs of ectopic pregnancy to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. /H17035Monitor vital signs for symptoms of rupture: Blood pressure, pulse, respirations, and temperature Urine output Skin color /H17035Replace fluid loss. Drug Alert Assess for signs of adverse reaction to methotrexate\u2014dizziness, seizures, nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage, anemia, urinaryretention, renal failure, lung disease, etc. Prepare client for surgery. Nurse Alert Patient Education: Reinforce the explanation of ectopic pregnancy and support the family in the adjustment to the lost pregnancy (if indicated). Provide postoperative care for abdominal surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Cultural Considerations: Some cultures may consider the ectopic preg- nancy to be the death of a child and may require that the zygote and tube be dis-posed of in a special manner. Be alert to this possible need and accommodatethe family if possible.5543CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 159 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. HYPEREMESIS GRAVIDARUM WHAT WENT WRONG? Nausea and vomiting secondary to elevated hCG becomes extreme. Nausea and vomiting is prolonged beyond 12 weeks of pregnancy and causes weightloss of 5% or more from the woman's weight prior to pregnancy. Dehydration,electrolyte imbalance, ketosis, and acetonuria may also result from the con-tinued vomiting. Persistent decreased nutrients to the fetus can result inrestricted growth of the fetus and possible preterm birth. Liver dysfunctionmay be noted with the condition. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035History may reveal risk factors: First pregnancy Pregnant woman less than 20 years of age Obese pregnant woman Multiple birth pregnancy History of psychiatric disorder Hyperthyroidism Vitamin B deficiencies Elevated stress levelGestational trophoblastic disease: Growth and degeneration of cells in the to grape-like clusters\u2014complete mole with no fetus orpartial genetic material derived from fertilized ovum /H17035V omiting over a prolonged period and an elevated specific gravity. /H17035Electrolyte imbalances: Reduced sodium, potassium, and chloride. /H17035Acidosis due to vomiting of bases. /H17035Elevated liver enzymes. /H17035Thyroid test shows elevated levels. /H17035Hematocrit may be elevated due to dehydration and hemoconcentration. TREATMENTS /H17035Fluid therapy as needed to maintain hydration: Ringer's lactate. /H17035Electrolyte replacement as indicated. /H17035Vitamin B6and other vitamins as indicated.3221Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 160 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Antiemetic (promethazine or metoclopramide) to control nausea and vomiting. /H17035Nothing by mouth (npo) for 24 to 48 hours. /H17035Advance diet if no vomiting within 24 hours to 6 small meals. /H17035Enteral nutrition by feeding tube or total parental nutrition if vomitingpersists. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Support the woman and family by explaining and answering questions. /H17035Provide dry toast, crackers, or cereal when solid food is permitted. /H17035Monitor the mother's intake and output closely to judge return of hydrationor continued fluid imbalance. /H17035Review and monitor the woman for common adverse effects of promet-hazine (including dizziness, constipation, urinary retention) or metoclo-pramide (including dizziness, sleeplessness, dystonia). Nurse Alert Review history for conditions in which this drug is contraindicated, including seizure disorder, breast cancer, or GI obstruction. Hold drug and report to primary care provider/physician. Patient Safety: Assess mental status for signs of depression, anxiety, or irritability, which may indicate adverse reactions to the medication. PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES (PROM)/ PRETERM PROM (PPROM) WHAT WENT WRONG? Spontaneous rupture of the membranes prior to the onset of labor is considered premature rupture. If this occurs prior to 37 weeks gestation it is consideredpreterm. The cause is unknown, but associated conditions include multiplepregnancy, infection (including urinary tract infection), incompetent cervix,history of laser conization, genital tract anomalies in the mother, hemorrhageduring pregnancy, of PPROM, hydramnios, amniocentesis, pla-centa previa, placentae, or trauma. prevented or treated quickly,maternal injury could include chorioamnionitis\u2014infection of the amnioticfluid\u2014or endometritis or more severe morbidity and possible mortality; fetalconsequences could include premature birth with respiratory distress syndromedue to immature lungs, fetal sepsis due to exposure to pathogen, umbilical cordprolapse or compression, or malpresentation. The earlier the occurrence ofPROM, the greater the possibility of severe morbidity or mortality. 14,5CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 161 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Passage of fluid from the vagina\u2014clear/blood-tinged amniotic fluid\u2014 confirmed by a positive nitrazine paper test (dark blue). /H17035Cervical dilation possible with effacement and fetal descent possible ifpreterm birth imminent. /H17035Signs of infection may be present (fever, foul odor to discharge, fetaland maternal tachycardia). /H17035Preterm labor may be present with preterm premature rupture of mem-brane (PPROM). /H17035If cord descends signs of prolapsed cord may be present (see condition). TEST RESULTS /H17035Sterile speculum examination reveals amniotic fluid in the vagina, confirmedby a positive nitrazine paper test (dark blue) and a microscopic examination(ferning test). Nurse Alert Avoid digital examination to prevent introduction of pathogens to fetus and mother. Fetal monitoring is continued and may show no distress initially. Cultures may reveal infection or initially may be negative. Newborn is assessed for sepsis and prophylactic antibiotics may be given. Ultrasound may reveal gestational age, amniotic fluid remaining, and fetal status. TREATMENTS /H17035Conservative treatment of PROM if pregnancy is less than 37 weeks gestation to prolong the pregnancy for fetal maturity. Bed rest, hospitalization. Fetal lung maturity testing as the fetus approaches 34 weeks. Corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity. Fetal monitoring for first hours post-rupture. Nonstress tesing (NST) is continued to monitor the fetus. /H17035Antibiotics may be given if infection is suspected or confirmed. /H17035Fetus is delivered vaginally or by cesarean if symptoms of infection arenoted. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Encourage the woman to lie on her left side to promote optimal uterineand placental perfusion. /H17035Question the woman concerning the time of rupture and onset of labor(if present) to determine the length of time without barrier to pathogens.4322Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 162 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

PRETERM LABOR (PTL) WHAT WENT WRONG? Labor that begins between 20 and 36 weeks of pregnancy is termed pretermlabor. Conditions that seem to contribute to preterm labor include abnormalcervical length, prior history of preterm birth or preterm labor, infection, orcervicovaginal fibronectin (fetal protein not normally found in vaginal tractafter 22 weeks, which is a high predictor for preterm labor). If preterm laborcannot be stopped, fetal mortality is increased primarily due to immature lungsand respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), decreased fat stores, and poor organfunction, as well as increased risk of trauma during birth. Maternal stress isincreased and treatments used to stop preterm labor may place the mother atrisk for adverse reactions. Additional risk factors for preterm labor includenon-white race, abdominal trauma, cervical incompetence, cervical dilation of1 cm at 32 weeks, bleeding after 12 weeks, uterine abnormality, stress, pro-longed standing, inadequate weight gain, clotting disorders, and pregnancywithin 6 to 9 months of previous pregnancy. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Uterine contractions: 4 in 20 minutes or 8 in an hour at 20 to 37 weeks. /H17035Cervical changes with dilation of >1 cm or effacement of 80% or greaterat 20 to 37 weeks. Cervical shortening (less than 25 mm before term) isabnormal. TEST RESULTS /H17035Fetal fibronectin (fFN), obtained by cervical swab, that is positive at 22to 37 weeks gestation is highly predictive of preterm labor. /H17035Blood glucose (may indicate uncontrolled diabetes). /H17035Thyroid hormones may be elevated indicating thyrotoxicosis. /H17035Laboratory studies: Complete blood count (CBC), C-reactive protein,vaginal cultures, and urine culture to detect infections. /H17035Ultrasound may reveal short cervical length and fetal status. TREATMENTS /H17035Bed rest in side lying position to maintain uterine blood flow. /H17035IV infusion for maternal hydration. /H17035Tocolysis (use of medications to arrest labor) includes the use of drugs such as -adrenergic agonists/ -mimetics, most commonly magnesium32215CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 163 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. sulfate and terbutaline sulfate (Brethine), to contain uterine contractions and delay birth. These drugs also cause suppression of other maternalmuscles and can result in side effects, including pulmonary edema. /H17035Fetal sedation and hypotonia may also result from administration oftocolytics but should resolve within 2 days after birth. /H17035Calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine (Procardia), could be effec-tive in arresting labor. /H17035Prostaglandin inhibitors (PSIs) such as indomethacin (Indocin)may also be used; however, the side effects are severe, making this aless common treatment. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Note mothers with risk factors for preterm birth. /H17035Monitor at-risk woman for uterine activity and teach her the signs ofpreterm labor, self-check methods to detect contractions, and the use ofhome uterine activity telemetry. /H17035Maintain regular contact with the at-risk woman. Patient Education /H17035Teach the at-risk woman the signs of preterm labor: Painful or painless uterine contractions every 10 minutes or less Mild uterine cramps low in the abdomen Abdominal cramping alone or accompanied by diarrhea Continuous or intermittent sensations of pelvic pressure like the baby is descending Membrane rupture Continuous or occasional low, dull backache Vaginal discharge that increases in amount, changes to pink tint, or becomes clear and watery /H17035Teach the woman to take measures to prevent preterm labor: Rest up to 3 times daily lying on the left side. Avoid lifting heavy objects. Avoid overexertion. Decrease or stop sexual intercourse, if needed, to decrease contractions. Empty bladder every 2 hours to minimize stimulation. Drink 2 to 3 quarts of water daily. Avoid caffeine. Minimize stress by focusing on each day and not trying to resolve all concerns at once. /H17035Teach the woman that if frequent contractions (every 10 minutes or less)are noted for an hour or other signs are present for an hour, or if clearvaginal fluid is noted, she should call her physician or midwife andarrange for an examination. 54Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 164 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

In placenta previa the placenta is implanted in the lower portion of the uterus instead of the upper portion. The implantation over or near the cervical ospresents the danger that as the lower uterus contracts and dilates in prepara-tion for birth the placental villi are ripped from the uterine wall, creating opensinuses that will bleed into the space. The cause of placenta previa is unknown,but women who have given birth by cesarean section, women who are blackor of other minority races, women with factors like multi parity (number ofpregnancies in which fetus reached viability), and high gravidity (number of pregnancies), mothers of advanced age, women who have had prior miscar-riage or induced abortion, cigarette smokers, and women giving birth to amale fetus are at higher risk for the condition. The condition can present in oneof several forms depending on the degree to which the os is covered. The greater the degree to which the os is covered, the more severe the tearing andbleeding and the greater the danger to the fetus and mother. The uterus maypresent with (1) low implantation, without os covering; (2) partial placenta previa;or (3) complete placenta previa (see Fig. 9.1). Signs and Symptoms /H17035Fetal heart rate: abnormal fetal heart rate 8 (i,e, bradycardia or variabledeceleration: persistent, severe or late). /H17035Amniotic fluid may reveal meconium staining. /H17035Painless, bright red vaginal bleeding (may begin as scant and progressto profuse).2CHAPTER 9 / Complications of at different cervical os/opening coverings.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Nurse Alert Do not perform a vaginal examination on an expectant mother with vaginal bleeding until placenta previa has been ruled out. Test Results /H17035Transabdominal ultrasound reveals the placenta in a low portion of uterus. /H17035Hemoglobin and hematocrit may be decreased if bleeding has occurred. /H17035Rh factor and urinalysis may be performed to detect other possible com- plications. Treatments /H17035If bleeding from placenta previa occurs before 37 weeks gestation, measuresare taken to delay birth until at least 37 weeks for enhanced fetal maturity. Monitor closely, bed rest (strict if bleeding is noted), and take vital signs every 4 hours. Maintain IV fluids and type and cross-match 2+ units of blood and keep on hand. Deliver at 37 to 38 weeks if fetal lungs are mature. /H17035If bleeding from placenta previa occurs after 37 weeks: In low implantation or minimal placenta previa with head presenting down in pelvis, if scant to no bleeding is noted and fetal status is sta-ble, a vaginal birth may be induced. If partial or complete placenta previa is noted or continued bleeding is noted with minimal placenta previa, birth by cesarean is performed. Nursing Interventions /H17035Monitor mother and fetus closely for signs of distress. /H17035Assist the woman in maintaining bed rest. Ambulation to the bathroomis allowed if no bleeding is noted. /H17035Monitor for bleeding. /H17035Note pain presence or level. /H17035Monitor uterine contractility. /H17035Use an external fetal monitor to evaluate fetal heart rate. /H17035Provide IV fluids as ordered. /H17035Infuse blood as indicated and ordered. ABRUPTIO PLACENTA What Went Wrong? Abruptio placenta is the premature separation of the placenta from the uter- ine wall (see Fig. 9.2). The severe hemorrhage that results is the primary causeof death of the fetus and danger to the mother. Occurrence is usually after20 weeks gestation, most often in the last trimester. 432Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 166 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. There are three types of abruptio placenta: /H17035Marginal/marginal sinus rupture: With placental separation at the edges with blood flowing between fetal membranes and the uterine wall to exitvaginally. /H17035Central: With placental separation in the center area, trapping bloodbetween the placenta and the uterine wall. Blood does not exit vaginallyand thus is hidden. /H17035Complete: With massive bleeding due to total separation of the placentafrom the uterine wall. The cause of abruptio placenta is unknown; however, risk factors for the condition include trauma to the abdomen (such as from a fall or car accident),advanced maternal age, history of high parity, cigarette smoking, maternalhypertension, rapid uterine emptying as occurs with hydramnios or multiplebirth pregnancy, cocaine abuse, uterine fibroids of the membranes (PPROM). Signs and Symptoms (will vary based on degree of separation) /H17035Sudden and ferocious onset. /H17035Tender, hard abdomen. /H17035Bleeding may be visible or concealed. /H17035Dark red venous blood.1CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 167 CervixUmbilical cordBleedingPlacentaUterine wall Figure 9.2 Abruptio placenta.

DISSEMINATED INTRAVASCULAR COAGULATION What Went Wrong? Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a disorder of the blood clotting that is acquired as a result of excessive trauma as well as in many of the com-plications of pregnancy (such as abruptio placenta or retained products of con-ception after an abortion). In normal blood clotting a balance is maintainedbetween the hemostatic (clotting) system and the fibrinolytic (dissolving) sys-tem. In DIC an imbalance occurs between clotting activity and fibrinolysis.Extreme clotting occurs in small areas of the circulatory system, decreasing theavailability of clotting factors such as platelets and fibrin for the general circu-lation, leading to increased coagulation and a bleeding defect at the same time. Signs and Symptoms /H17035Oozing of blood or uncontrolled bleeding may be noted from puncturesites from injections or IV therapy. /H17035Ecchymoses and petechiae form on the skin. /H17035Distal extremities (toes and fingers) may appear pale, cyanotic, or mot-tled and may be cold to the touch because small blood vessels are con-gested with coagulated blood, blocking circulation to the extremities. /H17035Neurologic or renal dysfunction may occur from occlusion of vesselssupplying the brain and kidneys. Test Results /H17035Platelet levels are decreased (thrombocytopenia): The level depends onthe ability of and speed with which the bone marrow replaces platelets. /H17035Elevated fibrin split products. /H17035Extremely low serum fibrinogen levels (less than 100 mg/100 mL). /H17035Large-appearing platelets on blood smear, possibly fragmented (frompassing meshes of collecting fibrin). /H17035Prolonged prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times. Treatments /H17035The first step is to resolve the initial insult, for example, deliver theinfant and remove the abruptio placenta. /H17035Intravenous heparin is administered to interfere with the excessive coag-ulation. /H17035A blood transfusion may be needed to correct blood loss.3221CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 169 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Nurse Alert If ordered, the blood transfusion may need to be delayed until after heparin has been administered so that the new blood factors are not lost in the abnormal coagulation process. /H17035Fresh-frozen plasma, platelets, or fibrinogen may be administered to promote clotting factors. /H17035Blood coagulation studies should return to normal range with adequatetherapy; however, tissue damage occurs secondary to blocked blood vessels,for example, renal or brain cell damage, and permanent injury may result. Nursing Interventions /H17035Assist as needed in the resolution of the underlying problem (see abrup-tio placenta, for example). /H17035Administer heparin and monitor clotting and bleeding activity. /H17035 Explain the use of heparin in DIC to the mother and family, making certain to explain that bleeding will not be increased because clottingfactors will be made available to promote clotting. HYPERTENSIVE DISORDERS PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION (PIH) Conditions in pregnancy that result in hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pres-sure [BP] above 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP above 90 mm Hg) may rangefrom mild to severe. Hypertension could also be measured as an increase of30 mm Hg above pre-pregnancy systolic BP or 15 mm Hg above pre-pregnancy diastolic BP. These conditions include gestational hypertension,mild to severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, and the hemolysis, elevated liverenzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome. When not treated quickly,several associated conditions have been noted: maternal and fetal death,hepatic rupture, placental abruption, acute renal failure, or preterm birth. What Went Wrong? The contributing factors for the occurrence of PIH may be multifactorial and a spe-cific cause has not been singled out. Possible changes during pregnancy, such asthe lowered peripheral vascular resistance of early pregnancy that resolves afterweek 20 due to shifts in hormones, may be over-corrected, resulting in hyperten-sion. Conditions involved in PIH may occur singularly or in combination: /H17035Gestational hypertension (GH): After week 20 of pregnancy the womandevelops hypertension without proteinuria or edema. The hypertensionresolves within 6 weeks after birth. /H17035Mild preeclampsia is the onset of GH in combination with 1 +to 2+pro- teinuria and a weight gain of 4.4 pounds (2 kg) per week in the last twotrimesters. Slight edema of the face or upper extremities is also noted.154Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 170 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Warning signs of the onset of eclampsia include hyper-reflexia, extreme epigastric pain, headache, and hemoconcentrations. /H17035HELLP syndrome is a form of gestational hypertension with severe preeclampsia with hepatic dysfunction in addition to coexisting hema-tologic conditions. Signs and Symptoms /H17035Symptoms may vary based on the level of PIH being experienced andthe organs being affected. Maternal vasospasm and poor circulation andnutrition delivery to the fetus can result in a low birth weight and pre-mature infant. /H17035Hypertension of various levels will be noted. /H17035Protein in the urine ranging from 1 +to 4+. /H17035Neurologic symptoms such as visual blurring, headache, and hyper- reflexia extending to coma may be noted. /H17035Liver dysfunction may occur. /H17035Epigastric or upper right quadrant pain may be reported and noted. /H17035Hemolysis\u2014blood cell death\u2014causes anemia and jaundice. /H17035Elevated Liver enzymes. /H17035Low Platelet count (<100,000/mm3) or thrombocytopenia is noted with accompanying elevation in bleeding and clotting time, petechiae, bleed-ing gums, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). /H17035Nausea and vomiting and epigastric pain are noted. Test Results /H17035Urine test may reveal proteinuria. /H1703524-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance and protein. /H17035Elevated or elevated aspartate transaminase [AST]). /H17035Complete blood count may reveal anemia (low hemoglobin and hema-tocrit) secondary to hemolysis. /H17035Abnormal clotting studies. /H17035Chemistry profile may reveal elevated creatinine and abnormal elec-trolytes due to impaired renal function. /H17035Nonstress test with biophysical profile. /H17035Serial ultrasounds and contraction stress test to determine fetus' status. /H17035Doppler blood flow evaluation to determine fetal and maternal status.22CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 171 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Treatments Administer magnesium sulfate before or after PIH onset to depress vascular and neurologic activity, lowering blood pressure and preventing or stopping seizures. Drug Alert Signs of magnesium toxicity include absence of deep tendon reflexes, urine output below 30 cc per hour, respiratory depression (<12/min)and decreased level of consciousness. Administer antihypertensive medications. Low sodium diet. Bed rest in side-lying position. Fluid intake of 64 ounces daily (unless prohibited by renal failure). Nursing Interventions Monitor pregnant women with risk factors for PIH closely for signs of onset, particularly those with age extremes (< 20 or > 40 years of age) or prior his-tory of PIH. /H17035Maintain quiet environment with dim lighting to minimize stimulationof seizure activity. /H17035Keep airway open should seizure occur. /H17035Maintain bed rest, in side-lying position. /H17035Provide quiet activity and diversions. /H17035Enforce seizure precautions: Keep side rails up with padding as indi-cated, use padded tongue blade or keep oral airway at bed side. /H17035Observe client closely for seizure if she complains of epigastric pain(possibly related to vascular engorgement of the liver). /H17035Provide a diet that is low in caffeine and sodium. /H17035 Teach the client to avoid alcohol intake. Patient Education Educate the client and family that at the onset of magnesium treatment sen-sations of flushing, feeling hot, and sleepiness may be noted. /H17035During magnesium infusion: Monitor vital signs, deep tendon reflexes, levelof consciousness, visual acuity, report of headache, urinary output, epigas-tric pain, uterine contractions, and fetal status (activity and fetal heart rate). Nurse Alert Monitor for signs of magnesium toxicity and if present discontinue drip, administer calcium gluconate as an antidote (should be standing order from physician), and have respirator and code cart available in case of arrest. Safety Alert Magnesium may cause sedation in the infant, and hypermagne- semia may also be noted in the newborn infant.543Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 172 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Gestational diabetes occurs when glucose intolerance is noted initially during pregnancy. The symptoms may resolve within weeks after delivery; however,in half of women diabetes mellitus develops within 5 years after delivery. Withgestational diabetes the fetus is placed at higher risk for spontaneous abortion,exposure to maternal infections, hydramnios, ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia frommaternal treatment of diabetes with insulin, skipped meals, increased exercise,or hyperglycemia with macrosomia (excessive fetal growth). SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Maternal reports of intense or unusually frequent hunger or thirst (due to hyperglycemia). /H17035Urinary frequency.21CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 173 1.

Preeclampsia/eclampsia may be noted more frequently with gesta- tional diabetes. Ketoacidosis with possible coma and death of the fetus and mother. TEST RESULTS /H17035Urinalysis reveals glycosuria and possibly acetonuria. /H170351-hour glucose tolerance test at 24 to 28 weeks indicates elevated glucose. /H170353-hour glucose tolerance test after fast reveals elevated glucose levels. /H17035Early pregnancy may show decreased blood glucose due to increasedtissue responsiveness to insulin, while in late pregnancy tissue resist-ance to insulin may result in high blood glucose levels. TREATMENTS /H17035Dietary management for pregnancy and diabetes control: Increase calories to 300 kcal/day with 40%-45% coming from com- plex carbohydrates, 15%-20% from protein, and 35%-40% from fats. Six meals (3 meals and 3 snacks) are preferable to prevent glucose fluctuation, with the night snack having a protein and a carbohydrateto prevent hypoglycemia in the night. /H17035Tight management of blood glucose with insulin is required: Use lower doses in the first trimester due to increased tissue sensi- tivity and insulin antagonist human placental lactogen (hPL) levels. Use higher doses in the last trimester as hPL levels are high with placental maturity and insulin is less effective. High doses of insulin may be needed during labor to balance glucose. A lower insulin dose may be needed with delivery of placenta and low hPL levels. Insulin may not be needed during the postpartum period. /H17035Close monitoring of fetal development with anticipation of large-for-gestational-age child and accompanying complications if glucose is notwell controlled. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Monitor timing carefully during glucose testing: /H170351-hour tolerance test (50 g oral glucose load followed by serum glucoseanalysis 1 hour later).432Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 174 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Patient Education /H17035Teach client and family the signs of: Hypoglycemia (weakness; tinglingextremities) Hyperglycemia (thirst, increased urination, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, flushed skin, fruity [acetone] breath) /H17035Discuss diet therapy and exercise for control of diabetes. /H17035Educate the client on insulin administration techniques. /H17035Administer insulin as ordered. Nurse Alert Avoid oral hypoglycemic agents, which are contraindicated in preg- nancy because they cause birth defects. Instruct the mother to monitor fetal kicks and record the kick count. Discuss the possibility that adult-onset diabetes may follow gestational dia- betes so follow-up monitoring is needed by the mother. CONCLUSION Complications of pregnancy can occur at any stage, beginning with fertiliza- tion and through birth. The nurse has a role in determining the presence of apregnancy complication at as early a point as possible to promote early inter-vention, if possible, to minimize fetal or maternal injury, or early terminationof a non-viable pregnancy to minimize damage to the female reproductivesystem that may result in infertility. Key points addressed in this chapterinclude the following: /H17035Fertilization of the egg does not guarantee a viable pregnancy, andgrowth of the fertilized egg in the fallopian tube can endanger the femaleif the tube ruptures and bleeding and shock result. /H17035The nurse should support the mother and father/family in grief with atubal pregnancy as with the loss of any pregnancy. /H17035Hyperemesis gravidarum presents a risk to the pregnant female due tothe loss of fluids, electrolytes, and nutrients with vomiting, and presentsa risk to the fetus for intrauterine growth restriction and possible pretermand low weight birth.CHAPTER 9 / Complications of Pregnancy 175 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The causes appear to bemultifactorial so anticipation is not guaranteed, and early detection ofsymptoms is key in early treatment and control. /H17035Management of magnesium sulfate requires monitoring closely for tox-icity represented by excessive suppression of reflexes and respiratorydepression. /H17035Gestational diabetes presents a danger to the mother and fetus if bloodglucose is not well controlled. The fetus can grow excessively fromexposure to high glucose levels and, as a large-for-gestational-agenewborn, will be at risk for hypoglycemia and other complications. /H17035Early diagnosis of gestational diabetes promotes early management anda decreased impact on the fetus.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 176 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 180 OVERVIEW Although most times the labor and delivery process is a long-awaited end to a pregnancy, it can be painful for the expectant mother and anxiety pro-voking for the mother and family. The onset and progress of labor has beenexplained through various theories or hypotheses: /H17035Prostaglandin connection: While the presence of prostaglandins appearsto stimulate labor and the blocking of prostaglandins seems to stop pre-mature labor, the exact mechanism of prostaglandins in the labor processis unknown. Prostaglandins are associated with rising levels of estrogenand oxytocin, platelet activating factor, and endothelin-1. /H17035Progesterone withdrawal hypothesis: Since progesterone plays a part inrelaxing the uterus, withdrawal of this calming effect through biochem-ical changes that occur when birth is near allows estrogen to dominateand stimulate uterine contractions. /H17035Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels increase as the end ofpregnancy gets nearer (and has been noted in preterm labor). CRH stim-ulates the production of prostaglandins (F and E). The increasedprostaglandin levels contribute to the stimulation of uterine contractions. THE LABOR PROCESS Each component of the labor process has a distinct role: 1.Passenger includes the fetus and the placenta. The fetal head size, lie, presentation, position, and attitude will impact the passing of the fetusthrough the birth canal. Since the placenta must also pass through thebirth canal, it is also a passenger. 1Attitude Breech presentationCephalic presentationDecelerationsDilationEffacementEngagementEpisiotomyLeopold's maneuversLieLightening Non-reassuringPassagePassengerPositionPowersReassuringRipeningStationTransition KEY TERMS Downloaded by [ Faculty Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

As the head is or extended different diameters (occip-itofrontal, submentobregmatic, suboccipitobregmatic, or occipitomental)present to the maternal pelvis. /H17035Lieis the cephalocaudal relationship of the fetal longitudinal axis (spinal column) to the maternal spinal column. The fetal lie can be parallel orlongitudinal to the maternal spine (vertical up and down/in alignmentwith the maternal spine) or transverse (side to side/horizontal at rightangle to the maternal spine). /H17035Fetal attitude is the way fetal body parts relate to one another, particu- larly degree of flexion and extension. The usual attitude is moderatehead flexion with arms flexed to the chest, and legs flexed to theabdomen. This results in the smallest part of the head presenting to thematernal pelvis. /H17035Presentation is the fetal lie and the body part that approaches the birth canal first. The fetal presentation can be head first (cephalic), hips first(breech), or shoulder first. 1. Cephalic presentation is the most common and is described based on the area of the head presenting. a. Vertex is the most frequent presentation with the fetal neck flexed to the chest and the suboccipitobregmatic diameter presenting tothe mother's pelvis. b. Military presentation occurs when the fetal neck is straight and the top of the head (occipitofrontal diameter) presents to the mother's pelvis. c. Brow presentation occurs when the fetal neck is extended, partially allowing the upper face (occipitomental diameter) to present firstto the maternal pelvis. d. Face presentation occurs when the fetal neck is hyperextended and the face (submentobregmatic diameter) presents to the maternalpelvis. 2. Breech presentation occurs when the fetal hips and feet present toward the maternal pelvis. a.Complete breech is noted when both the knees and hips of the fetus are flexed and the hips and feet of the fetus present to the maternalpelvis. b.Frank breech is noted when the hips of the fetus are flexed and the knees are extended, resulting in the hips presenting to the maternalpelvis. c.Footling breech occurs when the fetal hips and the legs are extended and one or both of the fetal feet present to the maternal pelvis. 3. Shoulder presentation occurs when the fetus is in transverse lie and the shoulder, arm, abdomen, back, or side presents to the maternal pelvis.CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 181 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Recording of the fetal position is done by indicating the relationship of the presenting fetal part to the maternal pelvis: /H17035The first letter represents the side of the maternal pelvis: Right (R) or left (L). /H17035The second letter represents the presenting part of the fetus: Head/occiput(O), hips/sacrum (S), face or chin/mentum (M), or acromion process of thescapula (A or Sc). /H17035The third letter represents the aspect of the maternal pelvis: Anterior (A),posterior (P), or transverse (T). For example, ROP = right occiput pos-terior (see Fig. 10.1). Fetal position is determined by the practitioner through use of Leopold's maneuvers , a series of abdominal palpations to assess the fetal presenting part, fetal attitude, lie, descent, and best location for auscultation of fetal hearttone on the maternal abdomen. The Leopold's maneuvers are performed withthe woman on her back with her knees bent and her feet on the bed to relaxthe abdominal muscles. Nurse Alert Perform maneuvers between contractions and instruct the woman to empty her bladder prior to beginning the maneuvers to promote comfort and reduce disruption of palpation due to a full bladder. Maneuvers are as follows: First: Facing the mother, the nurse should palpate the upper abdomen with both hands noting the mobility, shape, and consistency of the palpated part todetermine if the fetus' head or buttocks are at the fundus (top of the abdomen).The head will feel round and solid and will move separately from the largertrunk, while the buttocks are soft with bony knobs (hip bones) and they movewith the trunk (Fig. Submentobregmatic diameter Figure 10.1 Multiple categories of presentation.

The fetal extremities feel small and bumpy/uneven and should be opposite the back(Fig. 10.2B). Third: Determine the fetal part that lies just above the pelvic outlet (pre- senting part) by gently squeezing the lower abdomen just above the sym-physis pubis with the thumb and fingers. Note if the part feels like thehard head or the soft buttocks and if it can be gently pushed forward andback (not engaged) or is firmly in place (engaged). The findings should bethe opposite of those found in the first maneuver (if the head was noted inthe first maneuver, the buttocks would be noted in the third maneuver)(Fig. 10.2C). Fourth: Facing the woman's feet, place hands on the maternal lower abdomen and gently feel the sides of the uterus while sliding both hands downtoward the symphysis pubis. Feel for the fetal brow by noting the side withthe highest resistance to fingers moving downward. Note if the brow is on theside opposite the back (the fetal head is flexed) or on the same side as theback (the fetal head is extended) (Fig. 10.2D). 1. Engagement: The fetal descent into the pelvis is measured in centimeters using an imaginary line at the ischial spines as the landmark and noting ifthe fetal presenting part is above/superior to the line (minus station), atthe level of the ischial spine (0 station), or below/inferior to the line (plusstation). At -5 (minus five) station the fetus is just entering the pelvis(pelvic inlet) and at +5 (plus five) station the fetus is ready to be born (pelvic outlet). When the largest area of the presenting fetal part passesthrough the pelvic inlet (station 0), engagement has occurred (Fig. 10.3). 2. Passage: The birth canal, including the pelvis, pelvic floor, cervix, vagina, and vaginal opening (introitus). The fetus must be able to moveinto the pelvis and through the cervix and vagina; therefore, the sizeand shape of the bony pelvis must be large enough to allow fetal pas-sage. The adequacy of the preparation of the cervix for delivery is eval-uated based on the degree of dilation (opening) and effacement(thinning and drawing up of the cervix into the uterine wall). A Bishopscore may be used to assess readiness for delivery. Using a scale of0-3, five elements are evaluated\u2014cervical dilation, cervical efface-ment, cervical position (midline, anterior, or posterior), cervical con-sistency (firm, medium, soft) and station of presenting part. If thescore is 9 or higher for first deliveries/nulliparas, or 5 or more formultiparas, the cervix is determined to be suitable for labor and induc-tion can be performed if indicated. Cervical ripening may be promoted with medication (prostaglandin gel/Cytotec, Prepidil) or mechanical measures (balloon catheters, dila-tors or sponges with magnesium sulfate inserted into cervix, or lami-naria tents with desiccated seaweed) to promote induction of labor.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 184 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The nurse should monitor for urinary retention, rupture of membranes, uterine pain, contractions, vaginal bleeding, or fetal distress during theprocedure. The number of dilators or sponges used should be documented. 3. Powers include uterine contractions and maternal bearing down and pushing to expel the fetus. The strength of uterine contractions, alongwith the amniotic fluid between the fetal head and maternal cervix dur-ing the descent, plays a major role in placing pressure on the cervicalopening, contributing to uterine dilation and effacement. Maternal abil-ity to push and bear down is critical to the vaginal delivery of the new-born without external assistance. Contractions are evaluated based on the frequency , the time from the beginning of one contraction to the beginning of the next con-traction; the duration , the time between the beginning and the end of a contraction; the intensity , the strength (mild, moderate, or strong)CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 185 Large 41 week fetus in vertexposition engagedat -2 station 10 cm dilation of the cervix Anterior cut-away view-3Uterus Placenta Umbilical cord -2 -1 0 +1 +2 +3 Figure 10.3 Fetal descent stations (Birth Presentation).

Bearing down by the mother, once the cervix is dilated and effaced, promotes expulsion of the child. However, bearing down and pushing onthe cervix prior to full dilation and effacement can cause swelling thatwill impede dilation and can result in trauma and tearing of the cervix.Therefore, timing of bearing down by the mother is important to a suc-cessful labor process. 4. Position of mother during labor: The maternal position can promote the use of gravity to assist in the fetal descent. An upright, squatting, sit-ting, or kneeling position could promote fetal descent. The well-being ofthe mother is facilitated by position changes during the labor period thatpromote adequate circulation, rest, and comfort. 5. Psychological impact: Maternal anxiety and stress can impede the progression of labor by creating physiological changes that counter-act the relaxation of pelvic structures as needed to promote fetal pas-sage and delivery. This tension can distract the mother from focusingon pushing and bearing down when appropriate. The nurse can playa vital role in reducing maternal stress through providing informationto the mother and significant others regarding the progression of laborand all processes being performed for and with the mother, providingdirection related to comfort measures, and listening to and addressingany concerns as quickly and calmly as possible. Calm partners andcalm practitioners impact the psychological status of the laboringwoman. Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 186 1.

If the fetus is positioned in a posterior presentation back pain may be more intense. /H17035Contractions progress from Braxton-Hicks (irregular intermittent falselabor that do not change in frequency or duration or discomfort leveldespite activity; localized in abdominal area, no cervical dilation oreffacement associated) to true labor (regular contractions with increas- ing frequency, intensity, and duration radiating from the back to theabdomen; progressive cervical dilation and effacement are associated). /H17035Lightening: Descent of the fetal head into the maternal pelvis about2 weeks before the onset of labor. Often accompanied by increasedurinary frequency due to pressure on bladder. /H17035Cervical changes: Ripening occurs with a softening of the cervix toallow stretching and thinning. /H17035Bloody show: Vaginal drainage of brown-red blood-tinged mucus due tothe release of the cervical mucous plug when the cervix dilates. /H17035Rupture of membranes releasing 500 to 1200 cc of yellow, clear, wateryfluid with no foul odor, confirmed with nitrazine paper turning blue indi-cating alkalinity of amniotic fluid (not acidic urine). /H17035Weight loss of 0.5 to 1.4 kg (1 to 3 pounds). /H17035Gastrointestinal (GI) changes (indigestion, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting)may occur. /H17035Sudden high-energy surge. LABOR PROCESS The fetus proceeds through the birth canal for vaginal delivery through aprocess of: /H17035Engagement, when the largest (biparietal) diameter of the head of thefetus moves to station 0. /H17035Descent, when the presenting part moves through the pelvis from nega-tive station to 0 and progresses to positive station. /H17035Flexion, when the fetal head flexes to bring the chin close to the chestand presents the smallest diameter of the head to the maternal pelvis forpassage through the cervix and out of the vagina for birth. STAGES OF LABOR The woman and child undergo specific changes during each stage of labor proceeding to vaginal delivery. The stages of labor vary in durationdepending upon this being a first delivery for the woman (primigravida), orthe second or higher delivery (multigravida). 222CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 187 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Stage 1 begins with the onset of labor and has 3 phases: a. Latent phase i. Cervix 0 cm (begins) to 3 cm dilation (ends). ii. Contractions are irregular and progress from regular to mild to moderate, 5 to 30 minutes apart, 30 to 45 seconds duration. iii. Partial cervical dilation and effacement. iv. Spontaneous rupture of membranes (SROM) or artificial rup- ture of membranes (AROM). v. Mother is talkative and eager. b. Active phase: Stage 1 ends 8 to 20 hours (primigravida) or 2 to 14 hours (multigravida) after reaching this phase. i. Cervix 4 cm (begins) to 7 cm dilation (ends). ii. Contractions are regular, moderate to strong, 3 to 5 minutes apart, 40 to 70 seconds duration. iii. Cervix dilated 7 cm with rapid effacement. iv. Fetal descent begins. v. Mother becomes more anxious and restless as contractions inten- sify; feelings of helplessness may be reported. c. Transition phase: Ends when dilation is complete at 10 cm. i. Cervix 8 to 10 cm dilation ii. Contractions regular, strong to very strong, 2 to 3 minutes apart, 45 to 90 seconds duration. iii. Mother is tired, irritable, and restless, and feels helpless and unable to handle labor (this is the hardest phase of labor). iv. Nausea and vomiting and a sensation of needing to have a bowel movement may be noted. v. Urge to push noted. vi. Bloody show increases as amniotic fluid escapes. /H17035Stage 2: Duration of 30 minutes to 3 hours for primigravidas, and 5 to 30 minutes for multigravidas; begins with full dilation and ends withdelivery of the placenta. Pushing ends in delivery of the fetus (or if complications occur and alternate delivery is required). In most vaginal deliveries, the fetalhead position moves through flexion, internal rotation, extension,restitution and external rotation, then expulsion from the maternalbody: Flexion: During vaginal delivery the fetal head pushes against the cervix, pelvic floor, or pelvic wall, and the head flexes againstthe chest to place the smallest diameter for passage through thepelvis. Internal rotation: The fetal occiput rotates laterally and anterior while moving in a twisting past the ischial spines throughthe pelvis.

The head is \"born\" as it exits the vaginaby extension of the chin up and away from the fetal chest. Restitution and external rotation: After the head exits the vagina it rotates into alignment with the fetal body and makes a 1/4 turn asthe shoulder exits under the maternal symphysis pubis and exits thevagina. Expulsion: With the head and shoulders out of the vagina, the remaining newborn body flexes toward the maternal symphysispubis and is born. /H17035Stage 3: Duration of 5 to 30 minutes primigravidas/multigravidas; begins with delivery of the newborn and ends with delivery of the pla-centa. Placenta separates and is expelled\u2014one of two surfaces emerges first: /H17034Schultze: Shiny fetal side of placenta presents first. /H17034Duncan: Dull maternal side of placenta presents first. /H17035Stage 4: Duration of 1 to 4 hours primigravidas/multigravidas; begins with delivery of the placenta and ends when mother's vital signs stabilize. Vital signs stable Lochia scant progressing to moderate rubra FETAL ASSESSMENT DURING LABOR AND DELIVERY The stress of labor can impact the fetus in positive and negative ways. Theprocess of labor and delivery works to prepare the fetus for birth and the ini-tial breath that will launch the newborn into extrauterine life. Fetal assess-ment is vital during the labor and delivery period to determine fetal toleranceof the labor and general well-being. Assessments performed and desired find-ings include: /H17035Fetal heart rate monitoring: Performed by ausculatation with fetoscope or intermittent Doppler monitor held at maternal abdominal area where fetal back lies (lowerquadrants in cephalic presentation, upper in breech presentation, nearmaternal umbilicus if transverse lie). As the fetus descends into the pelvis the FHR descends and moves toward the maternal midline. Normal FHR is 110 to 160 beats per minute (bpm), with slight variability (change in FHR over a brief period of seconds to minutes). Normally, a short increase in FHR ( acceleration ) occurs with fetal stimulation (increased oxygen demand) or uterine contractions due tobrief hypoxia from compression on the cord (reduced fetal oxygensupply). This compensatory mechanism indicates a healthy responsive4CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 189 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Decreased variability may indicate fetal sleep (increases with stimulation) or more serious fetal problemssuch as sedation with drugs that depress the nervous system, fetus <32weeks with immature neurologic control of heart rate, neurologic dam-age, fetal anomalies of the heart, fetal dysrhythmias, or hypoxia withacidosis. Absence of variability is a serious warning sign. Count FHR for at least 30 seconds (multiply by 2 for rate/minute). Listen for a full minute after a contraction to detect anomalies andassess whether rate is abnormal (outside range), or if deceleration orirregularity is noted. Initiate continuous electronic monitoring (CEM) if anomaly is noted. /H17034History of previous stillbirth at 38 weeks or more. /H17034Complication of pregnancy suspected or diagnosed (preeclampsia,placenta previa, or other). /H17034Induction of labor (with Pitocin or other measures). /H17034In cases of preterm labor. /H17034Decreased movement of the fetus. /H17034Fetal status shows signs of distress (nonreassuring). /H17034Meconium staining of amniotic fluid (indicates fetus is stressed bya problem and evacuated bowels in response). /H17034Trial of labor after prior cesarean delivery. /H17034Maternal fever. /H17034Placental complications (inadequate oxygenation of fetus) Compare maternal heart rate to FHR to ensure that the monitor is tracking the fetus's and not the mother's heart rate. Electronic FHR monitoring can be external using a transducer on the mother's abdomen, or internal using a probe attached to the fetalpresenting part. /H17034Mother must be confined to bed. /H17034Membranes must have ruptured. /H17034Cervix must be dilated 2 cm or greater. /H17034Presenting fetal part must be against the cervix. Nurse Alert The presenting part must be distinguished to avoid placement of the probe on genitalia, or over an eye or fontanel. Obtain a baseline FHR for at least 2 minutes, avoiding periodic or episodic shifts resulting in change in rate >25 bpm. Baseline rate,variability, and timing of changes in FHR in relation to contractionsare noted during FHR assessment. Assess FHR when membranes rupture, after ambulation, after administration of drugs, after a procedure (i.e., vaginal examination,enema, etc.), or with any abnormal uterine activity.Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 190 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Decelerations are decreases in FHR from the baseline that occur early, late, or at variable times during a uterine contraction. /H17034Early deceleration occurs at the onset or early stage of a con- traction secondary to compression of the head by uterine constric-tion, with the peak depression of rate as the contraction peaksand return to baseline rate after the contraction. Rate remainswithin FHR range. This fetal response is deemed reassuring (normal). /H17034Late deceleration occurs well after a contraction moves toward or passes peak due to decreased flow of blood and oxygen to the fetusoften secondary to compromised placenta blood flow with mater-nal hypotension (due to epidural or oxytocin) or other conditionsuch as maternal hypertension, diabetes, vascular disorder, or pla-cental abruption. Immediate delivery or cesarean delivery may beindicated. Early and late decelerations occur gradually over 30 sec-onds or more. /H17034Variable decelerations occur at different times during a contrac- tion secondary to obstructed blood flow from the fetus to the pla-centa with a resulting fetal hypertension that stimulates the aorticarch carotid isabrupt/sudden (<30 seconds). /H17034Decelerations can occur in an episodic fashion without relationshipto contractions or periodically in relation to contractions (they areconsidered repetitive if occurring with half or more of the contrac-tions). Prolonged decelerations last for more than 2 minutes butless than 10 minutes. /H17034If decreased or absent variability is noted with late or variabledecelerations, tracing is viewed as nonreassuring (troubling) and acute treatment and continued monitoring are indicated.

Uterine relaxationshould be noted between contractions. /H17035Nursing care includes the following: Responding to any questions or verbalized needs Reinforcing prenatal teaching and preparations for labor and deliv- ery, including breathing techniques Assisting the mother to a position of comfort and changing the posi- tion as desired. Nurse Alert If the fetus demonstrates late decelerations, position the mother on the left side to improve fetal circulation. Provide oral care and comfort measures if vomiting is noted; pro- vide clear fluids as desired and tolerated. Fetal Assessment /H17035Record fetal heart rate (FHR) every 30 minutes, or every 15 minutes forhigh-risk pregnancies. Monitor rate and regularity, and note the vari- ability (fluctuations in FHR per minute), and deceleration (early or late). The desired range is 110 to 160 beats per minute. A fetal heart monitorshould be attached to the laboring mother to allow continuous monitor-ing if FHR is not within the 110 to 160 range, or late or variable decel-erations are noted. Latent Phase Maternal Care /H17035Continue monitoring vital signs every hour if normal, and more fre-quently (every 15-30 minutes) if findings are outside of normal range asstated above. /H17035Offer the mother ice chips or a mouth swab (or a lollipop) to relieve drymouth from labor breathing.CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 193 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

STAGE 4 (See Chap. 11: Postpartum Care.) MATERNAL COMFORT AND SUPPORT Maternal comfort is critical during the labor and delivery process. As indi-cated in Chapter 8 on childbirth preparation, there are many choices in paincontrol ranging from distraction, physical contact, and relaxation, to spinalblocks. A combination of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic measurescan reduce the total amount of medication needed and the negative effects onthe mother and child. /H17035Perform pain assessment with maternal vital sign assessment. /H17035Assist the mother into a position that provides maximum comfort andchange positions as often as needed. /H17035Change the pads under the mother, and linen if needed, and cleanse theperineum to remove draining fluids and promote comfort. /H17035Encourage support person(s) to assist the mother as needed with distrac-tion techniques, ice chips for dry mouth, and other measures that providephysical comfort such as effleurage or back rubs. /H17035Monitor the effect of medications and spinal blocks, if applied. /H17035Maintain hydration by offering fluids as often as allowed to preventhypotension from spinal blocks.

The use of gravity is beneficial to promote fetal descent and each position has benefits and disadvantages. Ultimately, maternal choice in addition to position effectiveness will determine the position used for child birth. /H17035Recumbent position is often assumed using a birthing bed or a bed withhead elevated and legs in stirrups. The nurse should monitor for pressure from the uterus on the maternal diaphragm and tilt the mother to the left side if indicated to relieve pressure on the major blood vessels. Cushionsmay be applied between the stirrups and legs to reduce pressure. /H17035Lateral Sims' position: Lying on the left side with the upper leg elevateddecreases pressure on major blood vessels and may relax perineal struc-tures. Maternal visibility of the delivery may be reduced. /H17035Squatting: Increases the size of the pelvic outlet to promote fetal passageand may shorten the second stage of labor. Mother may have difficultymaintaining this position so assistance may be needed. /H17035Sitting in a bed or in a birthing stool/chair allows gravity to assist withthe birth with minimal pressure on major blood vessels. Back supportshould be provided by the support person or nurse. /H17035Positioned on hands and knees increases perineal relaxation and pro-motes fetal descent and rotation. In addition, greater access to fetus isprovided. The mother will have a limited view of the birth and maybecome fatigued more easily. Support pillows should be provided. Adjustthe bed and mirrors, if present, to allow maximum view by the mother. USE OF DELIVERY ASSISTANCE MEASURES If labor does not spontaneously progress to expulsion of the fetus, measuresmay be needed to increase the passageway, or push or pull the fetus throughthe vaginal passage. /H17035Labor induction may be needed. If spontaneous labor does not occur prior to 42 weeks. If labor is prolonged due to inadequate uterine contractions. If membranes are ruptured, leaving the mother and fetus at risk for infection. If there are maternal complications such as Rh incompatibility, dia- betes, eclampsia, or pulmonary disease. If there is fetal death. Prostaglandins may be applied to the cervix, oxytocin (Pitocin) may be given intravenously, amniotomy (rupture of membranes) may be per-formed, or nipple stimulation may be done to trigger oxytocin release. Nursing assessment includes the following: Cervical readiness, FHR, and uterine contractions Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 198 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Nurse Alert Report signs of hyperstimulation. Assess baseline FHR prior to amniotomy and monitor throughout and after procedure. Note color, consistency, amount, and odor ofamniotic fluid and document along with time of procedure. Assess that fetus is engaged in birth canal at 0 or positive station prior to initiation of oxytocin. Obtain a Bishop score prior to begin-ning the drug. Monitor contraction frequency, duration, and intensity,along with FHR every 15 minutes and with dosage changes, andmaternal vital signs every 30 minutes and with each dose titration.Monitor maternal intake and output. Regulate oxytocin as ordered to obtain a contraction frequency of every 2 to 3 minutes and a duration of 60 to 90 seconds with an intensity of 40to 90 mm Hg per intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC); uterine restingtone is 10 to 15 mm Hg, and FHR remains within range (110-160 bpm). Stop oxytocin if contraction frequency occurs less than every 2 min- utes, duration exceeds 90 seconds, intensity exceeds 90 mm Hg, uter-ine resting tone is above 20 mm Hg between contractions, no uterinerelaxation is noted between contractions, or FHR is abnormal in rate,variability, or decelerations (late, variable, or prolonged). If uterine hyperstimulation is noted contact the primary care provider, position the woman on her left side, provide IV fluids asordered, apply oxygen, administer tocolytic (terbutaline[Brethine])to relax the uterus, and monitor FHR and uterine activity and record. /H17035Anepisiotomy , an incision to the vaginal opening to enlarge it during fetal passage, may be performed to prevent tearing of tissue during deliv-ery (controversial). Indications for use include the need to shorten labor, permit forceps- assisted delivery, remove premature fetus with minimal fetal trauma,and assist the birth of a large (macrosomic) newborn. Median/midline incision (easier to repair and more effective) may be made or mediolateral episiotomy (greater blood loss) may be per-formed. Third-degree lacerations may occur with both; fourth-degreelacerations are associated with midline incisions. Local anesthetic isapplied prior to the incision. Nursing care is noted in chapter 11:Postpartum Care. /H17035Forceps or vacuum-assisted birth may be performed if the mother is unable to push effectively or fetal distress is noted. Forceps may beneeded if fetal rotation stops, or abnormal fetal presentation or breechdelivery requires assistance delivering the fetal head (Fig. 10.4). Nursing assessments include the following: /H17034FHR prior to, during, and after the use of forceps (cord compres- sion may cause decreased FHR requiring repositioning of forceps). /H17034Client should empty her bladder or be catheterized.

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17034Verify that membranes are ruptured and fetus is engaged in the pelvis. /H17034Monitor the newborn for bruising after delivery. /H17034Monitor the mother for vaginal or cervical laceration (hemorrhage even if uterus is contracted), urinary retention due to urethral orbladder trauma, or hematoma formation from blood vessel rupture. /H17034Explain the procedure to the mother and support persons and reassurethem that bruises and hematoma on the scalp, if present, will resolve. /H17034Position in lithotomy or ordered position. /H17034 Report to the newborn nursery and postpartum nurses that forceps or vacuum delivery was performed to promote continuedmonitoring. THE CESAREAN DELIVERY WHAT WENT WRONG? A cesarean delivery is indicated when vaginal delivery is not safe due to prob-lems with the maternal pelvis or vaginal passage that pose potential danger tothe newborn or mother. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Assessments that may indicate that cesarean delivery is needed may includethe following: /H17035Fetal position that is not occipital (head first) such as breech or acromion. /H17035Insufficient or compromised placental blood supply to the fetus asmight occur with placenta previs, abruptio placenta, or prolapsed cord. /H17035Difficulty in inducing labor when immediate delivery of the fetus isneeded for medical reasons.45Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 200 Downward and outward traction FIGURE 10.4 Forceps delivery.

In particular, cesarean delivery may be neededfor multiple births involving: Twins if one amniotic sac is shared (monoamniotic twins), due to the risk that the cords will get tangled Multiple fetuses (three fetuses or more) Known anomalies that would make vaginal delivery difficult, i.e., conjoined (Siamese) twins /H17035Poorly positioned, large, or multiple fetuses cause an overstretcheduterus that cannot contract adequately during labor (uterine inertia),making labor long and difficult. TEST RESULTS /H17035Ultrasound may reveal measurements of the maternal pelvis and fetusthat indicate a risk for problems with fetal descent through the pelvis(cephalopelvic disproportion). /H17035FHR that indicates decreased or absent variability, late decelerations, orvariable decelerations, indicating the need for emergency cesarean birth. /H17035Maternal or fetal distress with labor, indicating the need for emergencycesarean birth. /H17035Labor that fails to progress, indicating the need for unplanned cesarean birth. /H17035Cultures of the mother reveal infection that could pass to the fetus dur-ing vaginal delivery. TREATMENTS /H17035Cesarean delivery may be planned such as when the maternal pelvis sizeis too small for a large fetus, resulting in a head-to-pelvis mismatch(cephalopelvic disproportion). Repeat cesarean may be needed if eachpregnancy reveals this problem. /H17035Emergency cesarean delivery is indicated if labor fails to progress andmaternal or fetal distress is noted and immediate birth is needed formaternal or fetal safety. /H17035The direction and size of the incision depends on the position of thefetus(es): Transabdominal incision may be utilized. Horizontal incision in the lower segment of the uterus is the most currently used.CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 201 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Labor may be allowed to attempt vaginal delivery on a later pregnancy even if a cesarean was done during a prior pregnancy. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Preoperative care involves the following: Obtaining an informed consent from the mother Assessing maternal vital signs and FHR; obtaining preoperative lab work and diagnostics as ordered Assisting the mother and family and answering questions; assisting the support person if attending the birth, and explaining what toexpect and how to support the mother Restricting intake as ordered (nothing by mouth beginning at mid- night prior to the surgery), and assessing the last meal if an emer-gency cesarean is ordered and notifying anesthesiology Positioning the client supine in a lateral tilt to shift weight off the vena cava and aorta (using a wedge under the hip) Teaching deep breathing and coughing exercises for use after deliv- ery to promote airway clearance postoperatively Inserting urinary catheter Administering preoperative medications and preparing the surgical site as ordered Inserting an intravenous line, if not already present /H17035Postoperative care is similar to care after abdominal surgery: Monitor vital signs frequently (every 15 minutes, then 30 minutes, then hourly during the early postoperative period and decreasing toevery 4 hours when the mother stabilizes). Assess pain and provide pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic relief measures. Monitor for and report complications of cesarean birth: /H17034Aspiration or other anesthesia-related injury /H17034Fetal injury due to surgery /H17034Premature fetal birth secondary to error in gestational age Nurse Alert If vaginal delivery is attempted in a mother with a history of cesarean delivery, monitor for risk factors for uterine rupture during labor, suchas having a vertical scar, three or more cesarean scars, triplets or more, or a very large fetus thought to weigh 9 to 10 lb or more. 5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 202 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CONCLUSION /H17035The onset and progress of labor has been explained through varioustheories/hypotheses including the following: Prostaglandin connection with stimulation of labor. Progesterone withdrawal hypothesis, indicating the lack of proges- terone to relax the uterus results in uterine contractions. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) levels increase and stimu- late prostaglandins, which results in stimulation of uterine contrac-tions. /H17035Labor involves a combination of factors that will impact the transitionfrom first contraction to delivery. These factors include the passenger(fetus and placenta), passage (cervical dilation and effacement), powers(contractions and maternal bearing down), maternal position (gravity),and psychological impact. /H17035Leopold's maneuvers are a series of palpations used to identify fetal pre-senting part, fetal attitude, lie, and descent as well as fetal heart tonelocation. /H17035Initial/premonitory signs precede labor, including backache, Braxton-Hicks contractions, lightening, cervical changes, bloody show, ruptureof membranes, weight loss, GI distress, or energy surge. /H17035During labor the fetal presenting part moves from a negative station toengagement at the pubis (station 0) to a positive station and then out forbirth. /H17035The stages of labor include the following: Stage 1: The onset of labor until full cervical dilation (10 cm) and effacement (100%) ( latent, active, and transitional phases ) Stage 2: Full dilation through delivery of the fetus through head flex- ion, internal rotation, extension, restitution and external rotation,then expulsion Stage 3: Delivery of the placenta\u2014shiny Schultze fetal side or dull Duncan maternal side presenting first Stage 4: Immediate postdelivery period until maternal vital signs stabilize /H17035Fetal assessment should reveal FHR between 110 and 160 bpm withvariability and acceleration of FHR with activity. Bradycardia, tachy-cardia, absence of variability, or late or variable deceleration are indica-tions of fetal distress.CHAPTER 10 / Labor and Delivery 203 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 208 OVERVIEW The postpartum period is generally considered to be the first 6 weeks after the birth of the infant and the return of the maternal reproductive organs totheir normal nonpregnant state. This period is sometimes referred to as thefourth trimester of pregnancy, or puerperium . During the postpartum period the mother will experience a number of physiologic and psychosocial changesas the body returns to the pre-pregancy state. Pregnancy and childbirth arenatural functions that most women recuperate from without complications.However, there are a number of physiologic and psychological complicationsthat may occur during the postpartum period. The first part of this chapterfocuses on anatomic, physiologic, and psychological changes that occur inthe mother during the postpartum period. The second part of this chapterfocuses on postpartum complications such as hemorrhage, subinvolution ofthe uterus, shock, infection, thromboembolic disorders, and psychologicalcomplications. THE FOURTH STAGE OF LABOR The first 1 to 2 hours after the birth of the baby is considered the fourth stage of labor . The fourth stage of labor is a crucial time for the mother and baby: /H17035They are both recovering from the physical process of birth. /H17035Maternal organs start the initial readjustment to the pre-pregnancy state and body system functions begin to stabilize.1After birth pains Diastasis recti Disseminated intravascular coagulation Downloaded [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035Nursing assessment is critical during this phase. All vital parameters such as pulse, respirations, O2saturation, blood pressure, lochia flow, level of consciousness, uterine firmness and position, motion and sensa-tion (activity level), perineum, and color are assessed every 15 minutesfor the first hour. Temperature is assessed during the initial observationand at the end of the first hour. POST-ANESTHESIA RECOVERY Women who give birth via cesarean or who had anesthesia require evaluationin the post-anesthesia recovery room or obstetrical recovery room. /H17035The required post-anesthesia recovery (PAR) score will be used to eval-uate the mother's readiness for discharge from the area. Components ofthe PAR score include activity, respirations (respiratory status), bloodpressure, level of consciousness, and color. /H17035The mother's activity, respirations, blood pressure, level of conscious-ness, and skin color and temperature are assessed every 15 minutes forthe first 1 to 2 hours. /H17035The woman who has given birth by cesarean or who has receivedregional anesthesia for a vaginal birth requires special attention duringthe recovery period. The mother is discharged from the recovery roomwhen she is stable. /H17035The transfer report will include information from the records of admis-sion, birth record, and recovery. The report should include the following: /H17034Name and age /H17034Physician /H17034Gravidity and parity given /H17034Duration of /H17034Type of birth; any surgical repairs /H17034Blood type, rubella status, and Rh status /H17034Assessment of vital signs and summary of findings /H17034Status of fundus, perineum, and bladder /H17034Information regarding the baby's sex, weight, and preferred feedingmethod PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES OF THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM UTERINE INVOLUTION AND DESCENT OF THE UTERINE FUNDUS Involution refers to the reduction in size of the uterus after birth, and its return to its pre-pregnant state. The involution process begins immediately after thedelivery of the placenta when uterine muscle fibers contract: 32CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 209 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. /H17035The uterine muscle contractions compress the blood vessels and control bleeding. /H17035Oxytocin is released from the pituitary gland to strengthen and coordi-nate the uterine contractions. /H17035To ensure that the uterus remains firm and well contracted during thefirst 1 to 2 hours postpartum, exogenous of the placenta. /H17035It is crucial to monitor the mother closely during the first 1 to 2 hours post-partum to detect any signs of hemorrhage and prevent hypovolemic shock. The uterus undergoes a rapid reduction in size and weight. At the beginning of the fourth stage of labor, the uterus is midline and can be palpated midwaybetween the symphysis pubis and umbilicus: /H17035The uterus weighs approximately 2.2 pounds immediately after birth. /H17035Through the process of cell catabolism the size of individual cells in theuterus is reduced, causing a decrease in the size of the uterus. /H17035Within 12 hours after delivery, the fundus may be approximately 1 cmabove the umbilicus and continues to descend approximately 1 cm orone fingerbreadth per day. /H17035During the first week the uterus decreases its weight by half, and by 2 weekspostpartum the uterus weighs approximately 12 ounces. /H17035The placenta site heals through a process of exfoliation, which leavesthe uterine lining free of scar tissue. The entire 6-week postpartum period is needed to complete uterine involution. UTERINE FUNDUS ASSESSMENT, OBSERVATIONS, AND INTERVENTIONS /H17035Explain the procedure. /H17035Ensure that the bladder is empty. /H17035Have the client assume a supine position with knees slightly flexed. /H17035Don gloves and apply a perineal pad in order to observe lochia as the fundus is massaged. /H17035Place one hand above the symphysis pubis to support the lower uter-ine segment during palpation or massage. With the dominant hand pal-pate the abdomen until the top of the fundus is located. Determinefirmness. /H17035If the fundus is difficult to locate or soft, maintain the position of thehand above the pubis and use the dominant hand to massage the funduswith the flat surface of the fingers until firm. /H17035Note any lochia and any expelled clots. /H17035Document the consistency of the fundus (fundus firm, firm with mas-sage, or boggy). /H17035Document the height of the uterus.4Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 210 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

AFTERPAINS Afterpains are cramping pains caused by intermittent uterine contractions. The pain is generally greater for multiparas versus first-time mothers due to the repeated stretching of the muscle fibers. The use of exogenous oxytocic medica- tions and breast-feeding intensify the pain because they both increase uterinecontractions. Assessments and required intervention may include the following: /H17035Assess pain using a standardized scale (facial grimaces or numeric). /H17035Administer analgesics as ordered. /H17035Position the patient in a prone position with a small pillow under theabdomen to help keep the uterus contracted, which aides in pain relief. LOCHIA Vaginal discharge during the puerperium consisting of blood, tissue, andmucus, commonly called lochia ,initially is bright red and later changes to a pinkish red or reddish brown. It may contain small clots. In the first 1 to 2hours post birth, the uterine discharge is similar to a heavy menstrual period.The redness of the lochia and the amount of lochia decrease throughout thepostpartum period and generally ends 4 to 6 weeks postpartum. Lochia flowis scant in post-cesarean births. Lochia flow increases with breast-feeding andambulation. Lochia flow is often heaviest when the mother gets out of beddue to the pooling of blood in the vagina during periods of rest. The nurseassesses lochia for quantity, type, and characteristics. Nurse Alert Not all postpartum vaginal bleeding is lochia; vaginal bleeding after birth may be caused by vaginal or cervical lacerations. Table 11.1 summa- rizes the characteristics of normal and abnormal uterine discharge. Recording the amount of lochia on the perineal pad by the hour is one method used for assessment (Fig. 11.1). Institutions differ on the agreement of termsfor measuring amounts of uterine discharge so review the agency policies. 3CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 211 Type Time Frame Normal Abnormal Lochia rubra 1 to 3 days Red vaginal flow consisting mostly Foul odor; large clots; of blood; small clots; fleshy odor saturated perineal pad Lochia serosa 4 to 10 days Serous; pink or brownish, Continuous or recurrent watery; decreased flow red color; excessive drainage; foul odor Lochia alba 11 days to 6 weeks Creamy white; light yellow; Recurrent lochia rubra; decreased amount continuous lochia serosa; foul odorTABLE 11.1 Characteristics of Lochia Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CERVIX After birth the cervix is formless with an opening wide enough to insert the hand. The wide opening allows for manual examination of the uterus and man-ual extraction of the placenta if necessary. Within the first week postpartumthe external os opening is approximately the width of a pencil. VAGINA AND PERINEUM The vagina usually appears stretched, edematous, and bruised, and the vagi-nal opening often gapes open when there is an increase in intra-abdominalpressure. By the third week postpartum the vaginal mucosa heals. Postdelivery the perineum is edematous. The perineum may have torn dur- ing delivery or the mother may have a surgical incision (episiotomy) to theperineum. Although the tear or episiotomy is small, an incision in this area cancause a considerable amount of discomfort. Hemorrhoids may occur duringpregnancy and during delivery. NURSING INTERVENTION FOR RELIEF OF PERINEAL DISCOMFORT /H17035Use aseptic technique and don gloves for perineal care. /H17035Teach the appropriate technique for perineal care (wipe from front to back).22Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 212 Scant: 2-inch stain (10 ml) Small: 4-inch stain (10 to 25 ml) Moderate: 6-inch stain (25 to 50 ml) Large: >6-inch stain (50 to 80 ml) Figure 11.1 Guidelines for assessing the amount of lochia on the perineal pad.

What are the priorities for care during the fourth stage of labor? Answer: 2. The process in which the uterus returns to a nonpregnant state after birth is known as ____________________. Answer:3. What are the defining characteristics of lochia rubra, lochia serosa, and lochia alba?Answer: 4. the relief of perineal discomfort postdelivery. Answer:ROUTINE CHECKUP 1 CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM The cardiovascular system goes through tremendous changes during preg- nancy (Table 11.2). During pregnancy, there is approximately a 40% to 50%increase in circulating blood volume (hypervolemia), which allows the motherto tolerate significant blood loss at birth without adverse effects. Many womenlose at least 400 to 500 mL of blood during vaginal births and approximatelytwice as much during cesarean births. During the first 72 hours after childbirth, there is a greater reduction of plasma volume than in the number of blood cells. This results in a rise inhematocrit and hemoglobin levels by the seventh day after the birth. There isno increased red blood cell (RBC) destruction during the puerperium, but anyexcess will disappear gradually in accordance with the life span of the RBC.The exact time at which RBC volume returns to pre-pregnancy values is notknown, but it is within normal limits when measured 8 weeks after childbirth.2 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The mother is frequently thirsty and hungry after birth due to the tremendous amount of energyexpended during the birthing process and the extended period without wateror food. Clear liquids are given prior to solid foods. The diet can be advancedas tolerated. Constipation is commonly a problem during the postpartumperiod due to the following: 1. Decreased peristalsis caused by the remaining relaxing effects of prog- esterone 2. Stretched abdominal muscles, which make it difficult to bear down to expel stool 3. Soreness and swelling of the perineum and hemorrhoids 4. Fear of pain If an episiotomy was performed, a stool softener or a laxative may be pre- scribed to avoid the discomfort of straining. A bowel movement is expectedwithin 2 to 3 days after delivery. The mother is encouraged to increase fluidintake and regular ambulation daily.2Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 214 Cardiac output Initial in cardiac output post birth.

The clotting factors remain for up to 4 weeks postpartum. This places the mother at risk for thrombus formation. Blood values /H17035The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are difficult to interpret during the first 3 days after birth due to the remobilization and rapid excretion of excess bodyfluids. The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels generally reach the pre-pregancylevels within 4 to 8 weeks postpartum. In the first 72 hours postpartum thereis an in plasma loss that results in temporary hemoconcentration. Normal plasma values (30-45 mL/kg) return within 2 to 4 weeks postpartum. /H17035Leukocytosis occurs immediately post birth, with the white blood cell countincreasing as high as 16,000/mm 3. The white blood cell level returns to nor- mal (5000-10,000/mm3) within 10 days.TABLE 11.2 Cardiovascular System Changes Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

URINARY SYSTEM During pregnancy the bladder has increased capacity and decreased muscle tone. Also, during the delivery, the urethra, bladder, and tissue around the uri- nary meatus may become edematous and traumatized. Urination is also hin- dered by anesthetic drugs. The diminished awareness of the need to urinatemay result in decreased sensitivity to fluid pressure, and the woman may notfeel an urge to void. This is important to remember because the bladder fillsrapidly as a result of intravenous fluids administered during labor and thediuresis process that follows birth. Urinary retention and over-distention ofthe bladder may lead to urinary tract infection and postpartum hemorrhage.With bladder distention, the uterus is displaced (often to one side, usually theright) and has a reduced ability to contract. When the uterus fails to contract,blood vessels are free to bleed. Therefore, it is important that the nurse mon-itor the woman for voiding and a distended bladder. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF A DISTENDED BLADDER /H17035Fundus is above the umbilicus. /H17035Fundus is displaced from the midline. /H17035Bulging of the bladder above the symphysis pubis. /H17035Frequent less than 150 cc. /H17035Increases excessive lochia. /H17035Tenderness over the bladder. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035To promote urination have the mother sit in the upright position. /H17035Run warm water over her hands. /H17035Pour water over the perineum to stimulate voiding. It is easy, noninva-sive, and should be tried early on. /H17035The nurse may try oil of peppermint because it releases vapors that mayrelax the necessary muscles. /H17035Administer pain medication if the mother fears the urination process willbe painful, which could interfere with her ability to void. /H17035Insertion of a catheter is invasive and should be the last interventionattempted. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM MUSCLES AND JOINTS During the first few days post birth, many women experience muscle fatigueand ache. With the delivery of the placenta, the effect of progesterone on mus-cle tone is removed. Therefore, muscle tone begins to be restored throughoutthe body. The abdominal muscles, including the rectus abdominis muscles,242CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 215 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Special exercises can strengthen the abdominal wall. Women need to be advised that with proper diet, exercise,and rest, abdominal muscle tone is usually regained more rapidly. Correctposture and good body mechanics are essential to help relieve low back pain.Encourage Kegel exercises to help the pubococcygeal muscle (muscle thataids bowel and bladder control) to regain normal function. INTEGUMENTARY SYSTEM Soon after childbirth the hormone levels begin to decrease and the skin grad-ually returns to the pre-pregancy state. The melanocyte-stimulating hormone(MSH), estrogen, and progesterone levels, which hyperpigmentationduring pregnancy, decrease rapidly after childbirth. Striae gravidarum (stretchmarks), which develop on the abdomen, thighs, and breasts, gradually fade. NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEM Neurologic changes during the postpartum period result from a reversal ofmaternal adaptations to pregnancy and trauma from the birth process. Theperiodic numbness and tingling of fingers that trouble 5% of pregnant womenusually disappear after the birth unless lifting and carrying the baby aggra-vates the condition. Postpartum headaches require careful assessment becausethey may result from a variety of conditions, including gestational hyperten-sion, stress, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid caused during placement ofthe needle for epidural Figure 11.2 Diastasis recti occurs with separation of the longitudinal muscles of the abdomen during pregnancy.

If the mother is bottle-feeding, estrogen levels begin to rise to follicular levels approximately 2 to 3 weeks after delivery, which allows the return of menses. Pre-pregnancy levels of estrogen and progesterone are slower to return inbreast-feeding women. Lactation is initiated as levels of prolactin increase, andwith increased breast-feeding the prolactin level rises further. In nonlactatingwomen the prolactin level declines and reaches the pre-pregnancy level within2 weeks postpartum. The extreme drop in hormones in the endocrine systemallows two significant events to occur: lactation (milk secretion) begins withthe newborn suckling, and the menstrual cycle function estrogen, progesterone, and human placental lactogen (hPL) (allprolactin-inhibiting causing a quick in pro-lactin secretion. /H17035Once lactation has been established, suckling is the most important stim-ulus for the maintenance of milk production and ejection. /H17035Prolactin promotes milk production by stimulating the alveolar cells ofthe breast. /H17035Oxytocin, secreted by the posterior pituitary, triggers the ejection of milkas the newborn sucks. Oxytocin also stimulates uterine contractions(afterpains) felt by the mother. /H17035By the third postpartum day the prolactin effect on the breast tissue isapparent, and the hormone is present in sufficient quantity to causebreast engorgement. /H17035The breasts become distended, firm, tender, and warm. At this time,milk, which is thin and bluish, begins to replace the colostrum (premilk). /H17035If the mother does not wish to breast-feed her newborn, she should avoidany breast stimulation, including newborn suckling, pumping thebreasts, or allowing warm water to flow on the breasts during showers. /H17035Prolactin levels drop quickly. Palpation of the breast on the second orthird day will likely reveal engorgement\u2014the breasts become distended(swollen), firm, tender, and warm to the touch due to vasocongestion. /H17035Breast engorgement is primarily caused by the temporary congestion of veins and lymphatics rather than by an accumulation of milk. /H17035Engorgement spontaneously resolves, and discomfort usually decreaseswithin 24 to 36 hours. A snug, supportive bra worn for 72 hours; icepacks; and mild analgesics may be used to relieve breast discomfort. /H17035If suckling has never begun and nipple stimulation is avoided, lactationceases within 3 to 7 days.22CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 217 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

RESUMPTION OF OVULATION AND MENSTRUATION /H17035Most nonlactating mothers resume menstruation within 7 to 9 weeks after childbirth. Breast-feeding delays the return of ovulation and menstruation. /H17035Ovulation may return within 4 to 6 weeks in nonlactating women and upto 6 months in lactating women. /H17035Some lactating women do not menstruate as long as they nurse theirnewborns at least 10 to 12 times in a 24-hour period. /H17035The first menstrual flow is often greater than normal for both nursing andnon-nursing mothers. /H17035The woman should be advised that it is possible to ovulate and becomepregnant before her menstrual periods are established. Nurse Alert Stress to the mother that breast-feeding is not an effective con- traception method. The woman should be encouraged to discuss family planning with her health-care provider. WEIGHT LOSS After delivery the mother's weight decreases by approximately 10 to 12 pounds. This weight loss is associated with the removal of the fetus, placenta, and amni-otic fluid. An additional 5 pounds is lost during the early postpartum period as aresult of diuresis and diaphoresis. During pregnancy the woman's body stores5 to 7 pounds of adipose tissue for the energy requirements of labor and breast-feeding. The lactating mother gradually uses this fat store over the first 6 months,and she often returns to her approximate pre-pregnancy weight. Some womentend to retain some of the excess weight gained during pregnancy. Therefore,women are encouraged to perform postpartum exercises to lose the excess weightgained during pregnancy and increase the strength and tone of various musclesin their bodies. Aerobic exercise has no adverse effects on breast-feeding. PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES Mood swings (postpartum blues) are common during the postpartum period. The rapid decline of hormones such as progesterone and estrogen is believed to con-tribute to the emotional upset. Other factors related to emotional reactions are con-flict about the maternal role and personal insecurity. Women who have economicor family problems usually demonstrate more stress in response to motherhood.In addition, past fetal losses or pregnancy failures contribute to postpartum emo-tional problems. Physical discomforts such as a painful perineum, afterpains,breast engorgement, and fatigue all contribute to negative postpartum reactionsand should be promptly managed to promote comfort in the postpartum phase.222Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 218 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

ROUTINE POSTPARTUM CARE Providing safe, effective care to the new mother and infant can be challeng- ing for many maternity nurses. Postpartum assessments begin during thefourth stage of labor and are complete with discharge (Table 11.3). DISCHARGE CRITERIA Most mothers leave the hospital as they are just beginning to recover fromgiving birth and learning how to care for themselves and the new infant. Thenurse should confirm that the mother and significant others have understooddischarge instructions. Discharge criteria include the following: /H17035The mother has no complications and the vital signs, lochia, fundus, uri-nary output, incisions, ambulation, ability to eat and drink, and emo-tional status are within normal parameters.5CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 219 1.

CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 223 POSTPARTUM COMPLICATIONS Pregnancy and childbirth are natural functions that most women recover from without complications. However, complications occur and nurses must be aware of the problems that may occur, their effect, and their treatment regimens. POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE What Went Wrong? Postpartum hemorrhage is the most common cause of excessive bleeding during the childbearing cycle. Postpartum hemorrhage is traditionally definedas the loss of more than 500 mL of blood after an uncomplicated vaginal birthor 1000 mL after a cesarean birth. Because most women have 1 to 2 L ofincreased blood volume during pregnancy, they can tolerate this amount ofblood loss. Postpartum hemorrhage can occur early (in the first 24 hours) orlate (between 24 hours and 6 weeks after birth). The greatest danger, how-ever, is in the first 24 hours because of the large venous area exposed after pla-cental separation from the uterine wall. The most common causes of earlypostpartum hemorrhage are uterine atony and laceration. Late postpartum caused by retained placental fragments or subinvolution . Signs and Symptoms /H17035Hypovolemia: Increased heart and respiratory rates to increase the circulation of oxygenated red blood cells. /H17035Skin and mucous membranes are pale, cold, and moist. /H17035Blood flow to the brain decreases and the mother becomes restless,confused, anxious, and lethargic. Nursing Management A collaborative effort by the health-care team is necessary to provide promptcare. The management for hypovolemic shock (reduced blood volume) result-ing from postpartum hemorrhage includes the following: /H17035Recognizing the specific cause (where the blood is coming from) /H17035Stopping the blood loss /H17035Starting intravenous fluids to maintain circulating volume /H17035Monitoring vital signs /H17035Providing oxygen to increase the saturation of red blood cells /H17035Inserting a Foley catheter to assess kidney function and urinary output EARLY POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE Risk Factors for of the uterus /H17035Multifetal gestation Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. Maternal-Newborn Nursing Uterine atony (hypotonic uterus) is the most common cause of early post- partum hemorrhage. Uterine atony is the inability of the middle muscle,which has interlacing \"figure eight\" fibers of the uterus, to contract andstay contracted around the open blood vessels. Without this contraction,the vessels at the placental implantation site cannot close and begin to heal. Mechanical factors that contribute to the inability of muscles to contract include retained placental fragments or large blood clots. Extreme uterine dis-tention can cause uterine atony. Observation of a soft, boggy uterus that maybe above the umbilicus is further evidence that bleeding is due to uterine atony.Overstretching may cause a lack of efficiency of the smooth muscle cells tocontract. A full bladder can also prevent the uterus from contracting (Fig. 11.3). Metabolic factors may contribute to uterine atony. Muscle exhaustion can occur from lactic acid buildup. Because calcium is an important regu-lator of smooth muscle tone, hypocalcemia may be implicated in some cases Fundus Bladder Figure 11.3 Signs of hemorrhage: A distended bladder pushes the uterus upward and usually to one side of the abdomen. The fundus may be boggy or firm. If notemptied, a distended bladder can result in uterine atony and hemorrhage becauseit interferes with the normal contraction of the uterus.

Magnesium sulfate administered to prevent seizures or as a tocolytic agentmay result in uterine atony by impairing calcium-mediated properties withinthe cells. In addition, calcium channel blockers, such as nifedipine, used inpreterm uterine contractions may also inhibit postpartum uterine contractions. Signs and Symptoms /H17035Fundus that is difficult to locate /H17035A soft or \"boggy feeling\" fundus /H17035A uterus that becomes firm with massage but loses its tone when themassage is stopped /H17035Excessive lochia that is bright red /H17035Excessive clots are expelled Treatments /H17035Bimanual compression of the uterus if nursing interventions and oxytocinare ineffective /H17035Possible return to the operating room for exploration of the uterus cavityand removal of placental fragments Nursing Interventions To decrease the risk of uterine atony, the nurse should do the following: /H17035Ensure the bladder is empty. /H17035Assess the fundus for firmness and position. /H17035Massage the uterus if necessary to increase tone. /H17035Assess and monitor lochia flow; report abnormal bleeding or excessive clots. /H17035Monitor the mother's vital signs and inability of the uterus to contract. /H17035If uterine atony is suspected the nurse should prepare for baseline labo-ratory studies (complete blood count [CBC] and coagulation profile) andintravenous therapy with dextran or albumin and blood products. Highdoses of oxytocin (Pitocin) may be indicated. HEMATOMA What Went Wrong? Hematoma is the collection of blood within the tissues, which may result from injury to blood vessels in the perineum or in the vagina. Soft tissues inother areas may be involved, which are typically seen as a bulging, bluishmass. Hematomas containing 250 to 500 mL of blood may develop rapidly.A hematoma may form in the upper segment of the vagina or may occurupward into the broad ligament, which can result in substantial hemorrhage. Perineal pain, rather than noticeable bleeding, is a distinctive feature of a hematoma, and the uterus remains firm. The mother may not be able to voidbecause of pressure on the urethra, or she may feel the urge to defecatebecause of pressure on the rectum.

LATE POSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE What Went Wrong? Late postpartum hemorrhage can occur 1 to 2 weeks after delivery and is typ- ically due to subinvolution , which is defined as failure of the uterus to return to pre-pregnancy size. The site of placental implantation is the last to heal andregenerate after delivery. A vascular area, retained placental fragments, orinfection may be the cause of late postpartum hemorrhage. Signs and Symptoms /H17035A /H17035Persistent lochia rubra. /H17035Irregular or excessive bleeding. /H17035Uterus that is larger than normal and may be boggy. /H17035Infection may be suspected if a foul odor to the lochia is noted. Treatments /H17035Treatment is tailored to correct the cause of the subinvolution. /H17035Antibiotics may be needed if an infection is present. /H17035The mother may require methylergonovine maleate.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a condition in which clot- ting and anticoagulation stimulation occur at the same time. The release ofthromboplastin uses up available fibrinogen and platelets, which results inprofuse bleeding and intravascular clotting. The key to the successful manage-ment of DIC is treatment of the causative event. It often is a secondary con-dition associated with abruptio placenta, gestational hypertension, missedabortion, or fetal death in utero. DIC is suspected when the usual measures tostimulate uterine contractions fail to stop vaginal bleeding.

THROMBOPHLEBITIS AND THROMBOEMBOLISM Thrombophlebitis is inflammation of the inner blood vessel wall with a blood clot attached to that wall. A thrombus is a blood clot obstructing a blood ves- sel that remains at the place that it was formed. When the blood clot tearsaway and moves into the circulation, it is called an embolus . If the embolus lands in the lung, it is called a pulmonary embolus\u2014a common postpartumcomplication. Thrombophlebitis can be superficial and involve saphenous orsurface veins, or it may be deep (deep vein thrombosis [DVT]) and involve thedeep venous system from the foot to the iliofemoral region. What Went Wrong? All postpartum women are at high risk for thrombophlebitis because of the nor-mal hypercoagulability of the blood at delivery that prevents hemorrhage, venousstasis from pressure of the gravid uterus, and inactivity. Approximately 50% ofthromboembolism is associated with inherited thrombophilia. Screening or pro-phylactic measures for those at inherited risk have not yet been established.8 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 230 Assessment The nurse, in a routine postpartum assessment, may be the first person to iden- tify signs of thromboembolic disorders. The nurse may note subjective signsof pain when she palpates the calves of the legs for heat and tenderness. Painin the calf when the foot is passively dorsiflexed is called a positive Homans' sign (Fig. 11.4). However, DVT can be present despite a negative Homans' sign. Comparison of pulses in both extremities may reveal decreased bloodflow to the affected area. Serial measurements of the affected extremity willreveal an increased diameter (edema and swelling) caused by venous inflam-mation. Leg pain that extends above the knee may indicate DVT. Fever andchills may occur. Risk Factors for Flex 5\u00b0 Figure 11.4 Homans' sign is positive when the mother has discomfort on sharp dorsiflexion of the foot.

POSTPARTUM (PUERPERAL) INFECTION Postpartum infection still accounts for significant rates of postpartum mater-nal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum infections fall into two broad cate-gories. The first covers reproductive system infections ( puerperal infection ), which are bacterial infections that arise in the genital tract after delivery. Thesecond category includes non-reproductive system infections that arise insites other than the genital tract and influence maternal morbidity during thepostpartum recovery phase. These infections, which include mastitis and uri-nary tract infections, are indirectly related to the physiologic features of preg-nancy, labor, birth, and lactation. A woman is considered to have a puerperalinfection if she has a fever of 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) or higher after the first 24 hoursfollowing delivery and the fever is maintained for at least 2 days within thefirst 10 days postpartum. WHAT WENT WRONG? The uterus and cervix are open after delivery of the fetus and are exposedthrough the vagina to the external environment. Exposed blood vessels arewell supplied, and wounds from lacerations or incisions may be present; there-fore, the risk of microorganisms entering the reproductive tract and extendinginto the blood and other parts of the body is high, which could result in life-threatening septicemia. Normal physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy increase the risk of infection. During labor, amniotic fluid, blood, and lochia, which are alka-line, decrease the acidity of the vagina; therefore, the vaginal environmentencourages the growth of pathogens. Many small lacerations occur in theendometrium, cervix, and vagina, which allow pathogens to enter the tissues. A cesarean birth is a major predisposing factor and poses a greater risk than a vaginal birth for postpartum infection. This is because of the trauma to tis-sues during surgery and the fact that many of these women have other risks,such as prolonged labor. When premature rupture of membranes occurs,organisms from the vagina are more likely to ascend into the uterine cavityand increase the risk of infection. Each vaginal examination increases therisk of pathogens entering the vagina and, in effect, being pushed into the7 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

It is an infection of the endometrial lining and adjacent myometrium of the uterus. Symptoms begin on the second to fifth day postpartum. This con- dition affects approximately 3% of women delivering vaginally and 10% to30% of those delivering by cesarean birth. Endometritis, if untreated, canquickly progress to parametritis (infection spread by lymphatics through the uterine wall to the broad ligament or the entire pelvis) and can spread, caus-ing peritonitis and possibly a pelvic abscess.

WOUND INFECTION Wound infections are common types of puerperal infections because of themany sites involving any break in the skin or mucous membrane. The mostcommon sites are the perineum, where episiotomies and lacerations arelocated, and the cesarean surgical incision. Multiple vaginal examinationsalso increase the risk of infection.77CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 235 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

MASTITIS Mastitis (infection of the breasts) usually occurs approximately 2 to 3 weeks after birth and may occur as early as the seventh postpartum day. The infec-tion involves the interlobular connective tissue, usually involving one breast. WHAT WENT WRONG? Predisposing factors include milk stasis (from a blocked duct), nipple trauma(cracked or fissured nipples), and poor breast-feeding technique. Other causesof mastitis are inadequate hand washing between handling perineal pads andthen the breasts.7 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

The symptoms may be similar, butthe conditions are different. The signs of postpartum depression (PPD) include general signs of depression such as weight loss, sleeplessness, and ambivalence toward thenewborn and family. Postpartum depression occurs in approximately 13% ofnew mothers and may have long-term effects on mother-newborn interaction. Symptoms of postpartum depression may be evident before hospital dis- charge, and patients at risk should be scheduled for follow-up visits beforethe traditional 6-week postpartum visit.

CONCLUSION Pregnancy and childbirth are natural functions that most women recuperatefrom without complications. The postpartum period is the 6-week intervalfrom childbirth to the return of the uterus and other organs to a pre-pregnancystate. The main goals in postpartum care are to assist and support the mother'srecovery to the pre-pregnancy state and identify deviations from the norm. Toprovide high-quality care, the nurse must be knowledgeable about the physi-cal and emotional physiology of postpartum adaptation. After the initial dan-gers of hemorrhage and shock have passed, the primary postpartum danger is infection . The uterine cavity is easily accessible to microorganisms from the exterior. Also, the site where the placenta was attached is an open wound andcan be easily infected. Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

St. Louis, MO: Mosby Elsevier. ANSWERS Routine Checkup 1 1. During the fourth stage of labor the nursing priority is given to the assessment of the mother for signs and symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage. The mother's skincolor, level of consciousness, fundus firmness, lochia flow, bladder, activity level,and vital signs (excluding temperature) should be assessed every 15 minutes. 2. Involution.3. Lochia rubra is characterized as red vaginal flow consisting mostly of blood, but also having small clots and a fleshy odor, and occurs during the first 1 to 3 dayspostpartum. Lochia serosa is characterized as serous, pink or brownish, wateryvaginal flow occurring during the 4th through the 10th day postpartum. Lochiaalba is identified as creamy white or light yellow vaginal discharge, which occursaround postpartum day 11 and may last for 6 weeks. 4. The nurse should use the following interventions to relieve perineal discomfort post- delivery: Use aseptic technique and don gloves for perineal care; teach appropriatetechnique for perineal care (wipe from front to back); teach the mother how to per-form a sitz bath; instruct the mother on the use of topical anesthetics and astringentpads if ordered; and assess pain level and administer analgesics as needed. Routine Checkup 2 1. Constipation is commonly a problem during the postpartum period because of the following:(a) Decreased peristalsis caused by the remaining relaxing effects of progesterone(b) Stretched a bdominal muscles, which make it difficult to bear down to expel stool (c) Soreness and swelling of the perineum and hemorrhoids (d) Fear of pain Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CHAPTER 11 / Postpartum Care 243 Interventions to eliminate constipation include administering stool softeners or laxatives, increasing fluid intake, and increasing activity. 2. Urinary retention and over-distention of the bladder may lead to urinary tract infec- tion and postpartum hemorrhage. 3. Encourage Kegel exercises to help the pubococcygeal muscle to regain normal function. 4. An initial increase in cardiac output post birth caused by an increase in blood flow back to the heart from the elimination of the placenta, which diverts 500 to 750 mLof blood flow into the maternal systemic circulation, and a rapid decrease in thesize of the uterus, which decreases pressure on the vessels.Also, changes are related to the movement of excess extracellular fluid into the vas-cular compartment. 5. The rapid decline of hormones such as progesterone and estrogen is believed to contribute to the emotional upset. Other factors related to emotional reactionsare conflict about the maternal role and personal insecurity. Women who haveeconomic or family problems usually demonstrate more stress in response tomotherhood. In addition, past fetal losses or pregnancy failures contribute to post-partum emotional problems. Physical discomforts such as a painful perineum,afterpains, breast engorgement, and fatigue all contribute to negative postpartumreactions. Routine Checkup 3 1. Signs and symptoms of uterine atony are boggy or displaced uterus that may be above the umbilicus; tachycardia is further evidence that bleeding is due to uter-ine atony. 2. To decrease the risk of uterine atony, the nurse should assess the fundus and mas- sage if necessary to increase tone and ensure that the bladder is empty. Monitor themother's vital signs and report abnormal bleeding and the inability of the uterusto contract. If uterine atony is suspected the nurse should prepare for baseline lab-oratory studies and intravenous therapy with dextran or albumin and blood prod-ucts. High doses of oxytocin (Pitocin) may be ordered by the physician. 3. Signs and symptoms include prolonged lochial discharge, irregular or excessive bleeding, and sometimes hemorrhage. A pelvic examination usually reveals auterus that is larger than normal and that may be boggy. 4. Patient teaching on locating and palpating the fundus and estimating its height is extremely important since subinvolution of the uterus generally occurs after themother is home. Explain differences in lochia flow: amount, color, consistency,and smell. The nurse should explain that the uterus should become smaller eachday. Instruct the mother to report fundal pain, foul smelling vaginal drainage, andany deviation from the expected lochia flow.

All postpartum women are at high risk for thrombophlebitis because of the normal hypercoagulability of the blood at delivery that prevents hemorrhage, venous sta-sis from pressure of the gravid uterus, and inactivity. 2. Swelling of extremity, decreased pulses to affected extremity, positive Homans' sign, erythema to the affected site, pedal edema, and pain at the affected site. Routine Checkup 5 1. A cesarean birth is a major predisposing factor and poses a greater risk than a vagi- nal birth for postpartum infection. This is because of the trauma to tissues duringsurgery and the fact that many of these women have other risks, such as prolongedlabor. 2. During labor, amniotic fluid, blood, and lochia, which are alkaline, decrease the acidity of the vagina; therefore, the vaginal environment encourages the growth ofpathogens. Many small lacerations occur in the endometrium, cervix, and vagina,which allow pathogens to enter the tissues. As the area of placental attachmentheals, necrotic tissue develops, which provides an ideal medium for bacterialgrowth.

Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 246 IMMEDIATE CARE AFTER BIRTH The newborn requires an immediate and thorough skilled assessment to ensure a satisfactory adjustment to extrauterine life. As stated in Chapter 10, the nose and mouth are suctioned when the head is born. The umbilical cord is clamped and cut, and then the baby is placed on the mother's chest for initial contact.The nurse should observe and note if the cord has two arteries and one vein(altered cord circulation could indicate oxygen or nutrient deficit in utero). Afocused assessment of Apgar scoring, temperature stability, level of reactiv-ity, size for gestational age, and attachment behaviors should be performed.A system's approach assessment occurs immediately after birth. Temperature stability: Support measures are provided to maintain body heat. The newborn is dried and wrapped in blankets or warmed againstthe mother's skin to allow early bonding and breast-feeding, if desired. If aradiant warmer is used, the newborn is left uncovered for direct heating of theskin. Apgar scoring is done at 1 minute after birth and repeated at 5 mintes after birth. A score of 0 to 2 is assigned to each area assessed (see Table 12.1). Level of reactivity is determined by newborn response, or lack of response, to stimuli. Generally newborns will have an initial period of reactivity imme-diately after birth. During this period the newborn will be alert with increasedrespiratory rate and heart rate, strong sucking motions, and bouts of randommovement alternating with stillness. After about 30 minutes of reactivity thenewborn enters a sleep phase that lasts from 2 to 4 hours. After the sleepperiod the newborn has a second period of reactivity that may last from 4 to6 hours. The periods of reactivity are ideal times to initiate breast-feeding ifdesired, and to promote bonding between the newborn and family. Gestational age is assessed based on physical characteristics and neuro- muscular development. Initial assessment may be done in the first hour and arepeat assessment is done 24 hours later to capture those reflexes and otherneurologic findings that were unstable for the first 24 hours.

The primary areas of assessment include the following: Neuromuscular maturity: /H17035Posture (term newborn lies with (square window >90-degree flexion flexion /H17035Arm recoil (<90-degree flexion angle if term) /H17035Popliteal angle (180 degrees for preterm to <90 degrees for term) /H17035Scarf sign (preterm's elbow pulls past the midline of the body without resistance) /H17035Heel to ear (premature infant can pull heels to ear) Physical maturity: /H17035Skin (sticky, transparent, fragile in preterm leathery, cracked in post-term) /H17035Lanugo (none in extreme in mid-preterm, none in post-term) /H17035Plantar surface (creases over full sole of foot in term infant) /H17035Breast (not notable in preterm\u2014clear areola with 5-10 mm bud) /H17035Eye/ear (preterm eyelids fused eyes open; thick, stiff ear cartilage) /H17035Genitals, male (scrotum flat and smooth in preterm testes hang with deep labia majora term) Attachment behaviors: Initial assessment of maternal-infant bonding may begin with observation of maternal response to the infant after birth. Noteresponse of other family members present. Continue observations wheneverthe infant interacts with mother, particularly during feedings, with the father,or with other family members. Newborn nutrition is an essential measure to a successful transition, though the type of feeding is best decided in the antepartal period. Human milk is thepreferred choice over formal prepared milk for the first year of life, due to theprotective elements passed to the newborn. However, the nurse should supportthe mother in her choice of type of feeding. The newborn is protected from injury through prophylactic eye treatment, vitamin K administration, and hepatitis B vaccine. The newborn is also givenan initial screening for inborn errors of metabolism. The newborn may beclassified as \"high risk\" according to birth weight, gestational age, or path-physiological problems. Such a newborn may require intensive care withskilled nursing care and personnel with specialized knowledge. NEWBORN ASSESSMENT Skin Skin integrity (absence of lesions, drainage, etc.), including the following: /H17035Color: Pallor (pale appearance) or cyanosis (bluish tinge) could indicate poor circulation or oxygenation; flushing could indicate increased bloodflow to the skin due to infection; or jaundice (yellow tinge).CHAPTER 12 / Newborn Care 247 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Back and Extremities /H17035Note any lack of or difficulty in mobility, or overtly uneven limbs. /H17035With the newborn lying prone, note if curvature of the spine (possiblecongenital scoliosis ) is present and report for further examination. /H17035Muscle weakness or paresis (may indicate neurologic problem or nutri- tional deficit), or extreme asymmetry of strength in extremities, hands,and fingers should be noted. Many developmental delays are evident or detected during the newborn assessment. Examinations at 6 weeks and later with a developmental assess-ment tool, such as the Denver II or other inventory, should be monitored anddeficits reported along with any relevant historical data. Assistance and refer-rals are provided to the family as needed. CAPUT SUCCEDANEUM WHAT WENT WRONG? Caput succedaneum is a result of the birth trauma during a vertex presentation.Trauma results in serum and blood accumulation in the tissue over the suturelines of the scalp. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Edematous tissue is noted over the suture lines of the scalp. /H17035The infant usually demonstrates no symptoms. TEST RESULTS No definitive test is required; the diagnosis is made on observationalassessment. TREATMENT No specific treatment is necessary and the swelling resolves in a few days. NURSING INTERVENTION Reassure the mother and family that the swelling will subside and that theinfant is not in pain.2CHAPTER 12 / Newborn Care 251 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Cephalhematoma occurs when the blood vessels are broken during labor and delivery and bleeding occurs between the bone and the periosteum. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS The boundaries of the bleeding between the bones are sharply demarcated. Thesymptoms are usually not present at birth but develop within 24 to 48 hours. TEST RESULTS The diagnosis is made through observation. TREATMENT No treatment is indicated. The lesion normally resolves in 2 weeks to 1 or 2months. NURSING INTERVENTIONS Affected newborns are at greater risk for jaundice and the nursing care isdirected toward monitoring the newborn for jaundice and the effects of hyper-bilirubinemia. HYDROCEPHALUS WHAT WENT WRONG? Hydrocephalus is a condition involving disruption of the circulation and absorption of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), resulting in an accumulation of CSFin the ventricles of the brain (see Fig. 12.1). This condition causes the ventri-cles of the brain to dilate and increases intracranial pressure. There are twotypes of hydrocephalus: /H17035Noncommunicating hydrocephalus: Caused by an obstruction of CSF flow. /H17035Communicating hydrocephalus: Caused by disruption of CSF absorption. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Rapidly increasing head circumference in infants /H17035Bulging and widening of fontanels in infants /H17035Underdeveloped neck muscles /H17035Shiny thin scalp /H17035Distended scalp veins /H17035Setting-sun sign where the sclera is above the iris /H17035Irritability5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 252 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

Hyperbilirubinemia is an excessive level of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is an end product from the breakdown of red blood cells that results in a jaun-dice appearance of the skin. Jaundice is classified as physiologic and patho-logic. Physiologic jaundice is considered normal and becomes visible whenthe serum bilirubin reaches 5 to 7 mg/dL; the bilirubin levels begin to fallafter the fourth day of life and returns to an adult stability in about 14 days. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS It is important to differentiate physiologic jaundice from pathologic jaundice,which must be treated as a disease entity. Pathologic jaundice occurs in the first24 hours after birth and is a result of excessive destruction of red blood cells. TEST RESULTS In pathological jaundice the total serum bilirubin is higher than 12 mg/dL infull-term infants and higher than 15 TREATMENTS /H17035Prevent bilirubin encephalopathy. if phototherapy does not alleviatethe excessively high bilirubin levels quickly enough. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035When the newborn is placed under phototherapy, the majority of all skinsurfaces should be exposed and the position changed frequently. /H17035Protect the eyes of the newborn from the fluorescent light with eyeshields that are properly sized and positioned to cover the eyes com-pletely. Nurse Alert The infant's eyes should be closed before the shields are applied so that the risk of cornea damage from the eye dressing is eliminated. NEONATAL HYPOGLYCEMIA WHAT WENT WRONG? Transient neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the newborn's blood glucoseconcentration is lower than 45 mg/dL in healthy full-term newborns, and lowerthan 36 mg/dL in newborns that are born at risk for illness or are premature.CHAPTER 12 / Newborn Care 255 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16]. Copyright \u00a9 McGraw-Hill Global Education Holdings, LLC. Not to be redistributed or modified in any way without permission. TEST RESULTS /H17035Direct analysis of the blood glucose concentration is necessary to accu- rately confirm the diagnosis. /H17035Destrostix or Chemstrips can be used to estimate the blood glucose lev-els but the most accurate test is done in the laboratory. TREATMENTS /H17035Provide the first feeding early after birth to maintain normoglycemiaand prevent hypoglycemia. /H17035Oral glucose feeding can be used; however, human or formula milk isjust as effective. /H17035Intravenous glucose is used when feeding is not effective. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Monitor for signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia in the newborn. /H17035Institute measures to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia: Reduce environmental stressors that predispose the newborn to blood glucose deficiency such as: /H17034Cold stress /H17034Prolonged feeding times /H17034Increased respiratory efforts When oral feedings are ineffective, intravenous glucose infusions are required. /H17035Protect the newborn from the side effects of hypertonic solution, such ascirculatory overload and intracellular dehydration. HYPERGLYCEMIA WHAT WENT WRONG? Hyperglycemia is defined as a blood glucose concentration greater than 125mg/dL in full-term infants, and greater than 150 mg/dL in preterm infants. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Hyperglycemia is usually asymptomatic. /H17035It is most often detected on a routine screening. TEST RESULTS /H17035Destrostix or Chemstrips can reveal blood glucose levels. /H17035Serum glucose performed in the laboratory is most accurate. TREATMENTS /H17035The initial treatment is the reduction of glucose intake. /H17035If dietary control is ineffective, low-dose infusion of insulin may beadministered.

NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Glucose levels are monitored very frequently. /H17035Numerous heel sticks are required; the nurse should be careful to rotate the sites to avoid tissue damage. GALACTOSEMIA WHAT WENT WRONG? Galactosemia is a rare inborn error of carbohydrate metabolism resulting in thenewborn's inability to convert galactose to glucose, which results in toxicityto tissues in the brain, kidneys, and nervous system. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035V omiting and diarrhea are common symptoms. /H17035The infant becomes jaundiced by the second week of life. /H17035Cataracts are detectable by 2 months of age. /H17035The newborn is also lethargic and hypotonic. TEST RESULTS /H17035The diagnosis is made on the basis of the infant's physical assessmenthistory. /H17035Newborn screening for the disease is mandated in many states. /H17035Laboratory studies reveal decreased levels of galactose in the blood andgalactose transferase activity in the erythrocytes. TREATMENTS /H17035Treatment includes eliminating all milk and lactose-containing foodsfrom the newborn's diet, including breast milk. /H17035Newborns are supplemented with soy-based formula. NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Teach the family about the nutritional intake and dietary restrictions. /H17035The nurse should incorporate the registered dietitian regimen in her planof care for the newborn. /H17035Teach the family to read nutrition labels; maintaining dietary restrictionsis essential. MAPLE SYRUP URINE DISEASE WHAT WENT WRONG? In maple syrup urine disease the branched-chain amino acids are defective or absent due to a genetic disorder, resulting in an increase in branched-chainamino acids and ketoacids (byproducts) causing a burnt sugar smell in the urine.5CHAPTER 12 / Newborn Care 257 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035Perform urine and blood tests following the first day of feeding. /H17035Assess diapers for maple syrup odor. /H17035Teach parents the importance of avoiding foods that contain isoleucine, valine, and leucine. PHENYLKETONURIA (PKU) WHAT WENT WRONG? Phenylketonuria is a genetic occurs because of a dysfunc- tional phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme that is used to convert phenylalanineto tyrosine, resulting in accumulation of phenylalanine in the body that cancause mental retardation. Nurse Alert The child has normal blood phenylalanine levels at birth; h owever, levels increase after birth and can result in irreversible damage by 2 years of age if not detected and treated. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Family history of phenylketonuria /H17035Mental retardation as early as 4 months of age /H17035Dry skin /H17035Macrocephaly5Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 258 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

NURSING INTERVENTIONS /H17035 Explain to the family that the child should avoid eggs, meat, fish, poultry, breads, aspartame, and cheese for the child's entire life. /H17035The phenylalanine level in the blood must be tested throughout the child'slife to ensure that phenylalanine remains within the desired levels. Nurse Alert Be alert for signs of phenylalanine deficiency (anorexia, skin rashes, anemia, diarrhea, lethargy) that might occur as a result of too little phenylalanine in the diet. RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME WHAT WENT WRONG? Premature infants born at less than 36 weeks gestation may develop respira- tory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease (HMD) due to a lack ofsurfactant to keep the alveoli open. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS /H17035Breathing greater than 60 breath per minute /H17035Retractions (suprasternal and substernal) /H17035Grunting /H17035Nasal flaring /H17035Cyanosis /H17035Flaccid5CHAPTER 12 / Newborn Care 259 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].

CONGENITAL HEART CONDITIONS Fetal circulation involves the blood moving from the right side of the heart to the left side while bypassing the lungs. Openings were in place between theright and left atria and the right and left ventricles to facilitate the blood flow.(See Chapter 7) When the newborn enters the extrauterine environment thepressures change in the chest, causing the lungs to open, and the cardiac bloodflow changes. The openings in the heart usually close, leaving only the valvesand pressures to promote blood flow through the heart and lungs. WHAT WENT WRONG? Occasionally the openings in the heart remain intact after the lungs are func-tional. These openings/defects may result in a shunting of blood from right toleft heart without oxygenation from the lungs, or from left to right ventriclescausing recirculation of oxygenated blood through the lungs with a decreaseof blood moving to the body. The decreased circulation to the body, or circu-lation of deoxygenated blood to tissues, results in poorly perfused and poorlyoxygenated newborn tissues and newborn distress. The degree of newborndistress resulting from a defect or combination of defects depends on theimpact the defect has on tissue perfusion or oxygenation. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS Varied based on defect (see specific defect).Maternal-Newborn Nursing Demystified 262 Downloaded by [ Faculty of Nursing, Chiangmai University 5.62.156.86] at [07/18/16].
