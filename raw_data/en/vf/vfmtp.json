It's something most of use can't live without, but it's slowly destroying your hair and the environment around you. Hairspray may seem harmless at a glance, but it's actually more toxic than you think. That's why I'm here to recommend some of the best natural hairspray products! I've got eco-friendly hairspray options, accessible natural hairspray options, and luxurious top-of-the-line options! There's plenty for you to find your personal favorite, wherever you may land on that spectrum. But first, you should know all about how traditional hairspray is terrible for more than just your hair. This article contains affiliate links. You can learn more [here](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/disclaimer/). Pin this image for later! Is Hairspray Unhealthy for Your Hair? Unfortunately, most hairsprays out there are not good for your hair or the environment in your home. The problem is your typical hairsprays come in an aerosol can so you can get a continuous spray around your head. Sounds great right? Not so much. Hairspray is full of toxic chemicals that no one should come into contact with. Parabens, microplastics, and artificial fragrances are only a few of the [questionable substances](https://livingsafe.com.au/toxic-chemicals-and-plastics-in-hairspray-making-us-sick/) that you can find in just about any big-name hairspray can. And these ingredients can cause significant damage to your hair. Most other beauty and personal care products are full of these things too, but what makes having them in hairspray more dangerous? It's the fact that these chemicals will linger in the air long after you spray. The big issue here is that hairspray damages more than just your hair. The most dangerous ingredient to have in your lungs is \"fragrance.\" It's something you can find on almost product, but that doesn't make it any less safe. In fact, it's one of the most dangerous things you can see on an ingredient list. Why? \"Fragrance\" is a loophole for companies to use so they don't have to disclose what makes their products smell so good. Consider it a trade secret. Since companies aren't legally required to disclose the ingredients behind the fragrance component of a product, that gives them the right to use whatever they want! That one word could be a cover-up for hundreds of questionable substances that I'm sure you wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. Is It Bad to Use Hairspray Every Day? Having your skin absorb all of that stuff is one thing, but getting it into your lungs is a whole different ball game. If you use traditional hairspray every day, you're breathing in questionable substances that can cause lung damage, asthma, and many other ailments that are entirely preventable. However, if you use a plant-based natural hairspray where you know and understand all of the ingredients, you'll be just fine! And yes, hairsprays like that exist. I use them all the time and love them! They're full of ingredients that keep my style in place while actually providing nourishment to my hair. Which is the Best Natural Hairspray? There's no ultimate \"cream of the crop\" hairspray, because everybody's different! But there are a few brands that will not leave toxic chemicals in the air and keep your hair healthy without being in an aerosol can. Let's kick off this list with one of my personal favorites! But first, I want to mention that most of these organic hairsprays are from [The Detox Market](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/thedetoxmarkethome). It's one of my favorite online marketplaces for clean beauty products! All of the products have passed rigorous tests for bad greenwashing practices and sustainability! You should seriously check them out for more inspiration! Or you can read my [in-depth review of The Detox Market](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/the-detox-market-review/) to see how they work. Innersense I Create Finish Hair Spray I've always found the names of Innersense products to be a little amusing, but they certainly do what they claim! [This finishing hairspray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/innersensehairspray) is the perfect thing to add to make your style stay all day long. It's one of my favorite products I mention in my [Innersense hair care review](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/innersense-hair-products/). The holding power behind this organic hair spray is actually honey, which I really like! Honey is already very moisturizing to the hair, and it creates a resin to hold things in place. Rice proteins and aloe are also found in the ingredient list to help with moisture and growth. My personal favorite quality about [this hairspray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/innersensehairspray) is that you can get it in different sizes on [The Detox Market](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/thedetoxmarkethome). I know that most of these organic hairsprays are well over $20, which can be a little crazy! However, you can get the smallest size of this for only $9, which I prefer because I don't use hairspray that much, and it's travel-friendly! Captain Blankenship Texture Sea Salt Spray I know that this comes off as more of a texturizing spray than a hair spray, but [this spray by Captain Blankenship](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/cbseasaltspray) is seriously a hidden gem of a product such a good price! It's got good ingredients to keep your hair healthy and hydrated, like aloe vera. Your hair won't feel crunchy or damaged after using this non-toxic hair spray! One of my favorite parts about this sea salt spray is that it comes in a small glass bottle, so it's easier on the environment and you're not left with a massive product that will sit in your cabinet for years. If you like to give just a litle bit of texture to your hair but don't want to get a product that will overwhelm your hair, this is the perfect option. Plus, it has excellent hold! Josh Rosebrook Hairspray Josh Rosebrook is known to be one of the higher-end brands in the clean beauty world, and I can certainly see why! [This luxurious hairspray](https://amzn.to/3J33NZN) gets its holding power from plant-based ingredients, like the yucca plant whose juice provides a firm yet touchable hold on your style. And not only that, but the ingredient list includes herbal boosts to promote hair health and fast growth. You'll find lavender, peppermint, rosemary, and oregano which are excellent for stimulating the scalp for some quick hair growth. Who wouldn't want their hairspray to actually be an all-day hair treatment?! But the cherry on top is that all ingredients are certified organic and non-GMO! This is the best organic hairspray for those who like a spectrum of light or firm hold because this hairspray can be layered for a desired effect. If you want a firmer hold than usual, just wait until your first layer is dry before adding another one. And don't worry about crunchiness! I've never had that problem with this hairspray. John Masters Organic Hairspray Yet another brand that's considered the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me of the clean beauty world, [John Masters Organics hairspray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/johnmastershairspray) gets its holding power from acacia gum while providing some moisturizing qualities from aloe vera. All of the ingredients in this hairspray are also 100% organic, which I absolutely love! It's one of the very few hairsprays on the market to earn the USDA organic seal. Which also makes it the best organic hairspray with strong hold. This means that absolutely every ingredient in this product has been evaluated by third party testing to prove that it is, in fact, completely organic. The FDA actually has no guidelines for the term \"organic,\" in cosmetics, so this is how you know it's legit! You can either spray [this lovely organic hairspray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/johnmastershairspray) into damp hair and continue styling or spray it at your roots for some extra volume. Doing that makes me nervous that my hair will feel like a gunky mess afterwards, but I've found that my hair felt soft and smooth instead! Honeybee Gardens Hair Spray This is one of my personal favorite clean beauty brands because everything is so cheap! But don't think they skimp on quality! I've been using [Honeybee Gardens' makeup](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/honeybee-gardens-review/) for years and I absolutely love it. If you want a bottle of [full-sized natural hairspray](https://amzn.to/2SK9Isj) without paying $25 for it, this is your product! It's certified cruelty-free, non-GMO, and manufactured by a woman-owned company. To me, Honeybee Gardens is one of those smaller diamond-in-the-rough brands that you really want to succeed! There are herbal boosts in this hairspray that provide a luxurious scent to the air instead of dangerous chemicals. You can find lavender, chamomile, rosemary and peppermint to help with the health of your hair. Spraying this at your roots would be great for your scalp! It's currently the [best natural hairspray on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2SK9Isj), with lots of positive reviews. I agree that it has amazing hold, along with the one complaint that things can get a little bit sticky if you apply too much. I've found that if I don't apply it to liberally, I can get a good hold on my style without having to wipe down my neck. Rahua Defining Hair Spray This product is probably the most [expensive natural hairspray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/rahuahairspray) on this list, coming in at a whopping $37! But you certainly get what you pay for. Rahua sounded like such a weird name for a brand to me, until I found out the story behind brand. Rahua started when a renowned hairstylist took a trip to the Amazon (the jungle, not the company) and noticed that all the natives had long, luscious hair. When asked their secret, they simply said Rahua oil. Since then, the hair stylist works with local Amazonian families to sustainably source ingredients so you can reap the benefits too. You can read more about their amazing haircare products in my full [Rahua review](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/rahua-hydration-shampoo-review/)! Sugarcane extract is what makes the hold on [this hairspray so legendary](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/rahuahairspray). And you can use it for more than holding your style in place! Apply it to your ends to prevent flyaways, or spray it on your hands to smooth away frizziness and reveal soft, sleek hair in its place. If you need an especially hydrating hairspray, this is your best option! Yarok Feed Your Hold Hairspray The last item on this list of best non-toxic hairspray products is definitely not the least! It's a non-aerosol can without harsh chemicals or cruelty. The best hairspray you can find must have all of these! All ingredients are plant-based, with one of the main ingredients being non-GMO corn extract and vegetable glycerin. This makes me say confidently that your hair will be healthy and moisturized after every use. My personal favorite thing about this natural hairspray is that the ingredient list is so simple and short. I also like that the only essential oil in the list is rosemary, which is great when applied to the scalp. The smell is also fantastic! I love [spraying this on my hair](https://amzn.to/400cyKj) and getting an invigorating whiff of rosemary for some aromatherapy benefits. What are The Best Natural Hairsprays at Target? Unfortunately, there aren't any natural hairsprays at Target at all! Which is a huge bummer. Target has been doing great in terms of providing a good selection of natural and non-toxic beauty options. But they have yet to dish out some good natural hairspray options. Believe me, I tore their website apart! But when something pops up, I'll update this section ASAP. What is the Best Natural Hairspray for Fine Hair? As someone with very fine hair, I'm an expert on finding products that actually work with my locks. All you fine-haired readers know that it's not easy! To me, the [I Create Hold Hairspray by Innersense](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/icreatehold) does the job perfectly. I'm always impressed with the hold, and it doesn't make my hair feel crunchy or damaged. In fact, it always stays smooth! What is the Best Hairspray for Hold? If we're talking sheer holding power with nothing else to think about, I would say that the [Rahua Defining Spray](https://essentialmovestowellness.com/rahuahairspray) wins this contest. You certainly get what you pay for! I've never had an issue with Rahua making my hair feel crunchy or weighed-down, but just rememer, your hair is not moving when you apply it! Do with that what you will. Final Thoughts on the Best Natural Hairspray While there's really no such thing as the best natural hairspray on Earth, any of these products could certainly pass for that! Any of them would be great for the health of your hair and the environment around you. I personally think hairspray should be one of the first styling products you switch out! Who knows how many nasty chemicals you're spraying into the air every morning? That's the problem with the cosmetics industry today, we don't. And there's no end in sight until proper regulations are passed. I hope that this article introduced you to some amazing new brands! All of them are absolutely worth looking into, because they offer way more than hairspray. I love to support small clean beauty brands, because they're going to be the difference between making progress in the cosmetics world and no progress at all.
