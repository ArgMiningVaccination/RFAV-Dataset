Meditation may have become detached from its ritual and spiritual context, but people still strive to train their attention and awareness in order to become present in the here and now. Inner peace, serenity, joy, focus, resolve - all are attributes that are associated with strength and fortitude. And each of these attributes resides within our inner selves. The change we seek can only ensue with practice: just as we would build, relax, stretch and train a muscle, the mind can also be subject to training. Meditation is the key that unlocks the door to determining our own state of mind. By learning to be in command of our mind, emotions and thoughts, we learn to exercise control over ourselves. We become aware. The essence of meditation is a more intense and conscious experience of life at all times - not just when we happen to direct our focus on it. Serene mindfulness is a way of life. Meditation is a form of consciousness training that helps us to anchor calm mindfulness in our being, to make it a state that becomes and remains intrinsic to our being without the need for conscious action.

THE MANY FORMS OF MEDITATION The image we have of meditation does not necessarily correspond to reality, as meditation can take many forms and doesn't have to mean sitting immobile in the lotus position for hours - although, obviously, it can. In fact, everyday activities such household chores and exercising in nature can be experienced as meditation. Meditation does not follow a specific pattern, but there are methods and approaches that can help you improve your focus.
