Worl d oil prod uction h as been run ning at near capacity to meet demand, pushin g prices upw ard. Co ncerns about meeting increasing demand with finite r esources have renewed inter est in an old ques tion: How long can th e oil supply ex pand befor e reaching a maximu m level of prod uction \u2014a peak \u2014from whic h it can only decline? GAO (1) examine d whe n oil prod uction could peak, (2) ass essed the po tential for transportation technologies to mitigate the conseq uences of a peak in oil pr oduction, and (3) ex amined federal agency efforts that could reduce uncertainty about the timing of a pe ak or mitigate the conseq uences. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed studies, convened an expert panel, and consulted agency officials. What GAO Recommends To better prepare for a pe ak in oil prod uction, GAO r ecomm ends that the Secretary of En ergy work with othe r agencies to e stablish a strategy to co ordin ate and prioritize federal agen cy efforts to reduce uncertainty about the likely timing of a peak an d to ad vise Congr ess on how bes t to mitigate cons equences. In comm enting on a draft of the report, the Departments of Energy and the Interior generally agreed with the report and r ecomm endatio ns. Most studies estimate that oil produc tion will peak sometime between now and 20 40. This rang e of est imate s is wide because the timin g of the peak depends on multiple, uncertain factors th at will help determine how quickly the oil remaining in the ground is used, in cluding th e amount of oil still in the ground; how much of that oil ca n ultimately be produced given technological, cost, and en vironmental challenges as well as potentially unfavorable political and investment condi tions in some countries where oil is located; and future global demand for oil. Dem and for oil will, in turn, be influenced b y global econ omic growth and may be affected by government policie on the env ironment and cl imate ch ange and consumer choic es about conservation. In the United States, alternative fuel s and transport ation technologies face chall enges th at could imp ede their ability to miti gate the cons equences of a peak and decline in oil production, unl ess sufficient time and effort are brought to b ear. For example, although corn ethanol producti on is technicall y feasible, it is more expens ive to produce than gasoline and will require costl y investments in infrastr ucture, such as pipel ines and storage tanks, before it can beco me wide ly available as a primary fuel. Key alternative technol ogies currently supply the equivalent of only about 1 percent of U.S. consumption of petr oleum products, and the Department of Energy (DOE) projects t hat ev en by 2015, they could displa ce only the equivalent of 4 percent of projected U.S. annual co nsumption. I n such circum stanc es, an im minent peak and sharp declin e in oil produ ction could caus e a worldwide rec ession. If the peak is d elayed, however, these technologies have a greater potential to mitigate the consequen ces. DOE projects that the technologies could displace up to 34 percent of U.S. consumption in the 2025 t hrough 2030 time fram e, if the chal lenges are met. The le vel of effort dedica ted to overco ming challen ges will depend in part on sustained high oil prices t o encourag e sufficient investment in and demand for alternativ es. Federal agen cy efforts that could reduc e uncertainty about the timing of peak oil production or mitigat e its cons equences are spread across multiple agencies and are generally not focuse d explicit ly on peak oil. Federal ly sponsored studies have expressed con cern over the potential for a peak, and agency offic ials h ave iden tified a ctions that could be taken to ad dress this issue. For ex ample , DOE and United St ates Geolog ical Survey officia ls said uncertainty about the peak's timing could be reduced through b etter information about world wide demand and supply, and agency officials said they could st ep up efforts to promote alternative fuels and transp ortation technologies. However, th ere is no coo rdinated federal str ategy f or reducing uncertainty about mitigating its consequ ences. www.gao.g ov/cgi-bin/getrpt? GAO-07-283 .

Bartlett The Honorable Judy Biggert The Honorable Wayn e T. Gilchrest The Honorable Vernon J . Ehlers The Honorable Lynn C. Woolsey House of Representative s U.S. consumers paid $38 billion more fo r gasoline in the first 6 months of 2006 than th ey paid in th e same period of 2005, an d $57 b illion more than they paid in the same pe riod of 200 4, in large p art because of rising oil prices, which reached a 24-ye ar high in 200 6 whe n adjusted f or inflation. Oil is a glob al commodity, and its pri ce is determined mainly by the balance bet ween world demand and supply. Since 1983, world consumption of petroleum products has grown fairly steadil y. The Department of Energy's (DOE) Energ y Information Administration (EIA) states in a 2 006 report t hat world c onsumption of petroleum had reach ed 84 million barrels per day in 2005.1 EIA also projects that world oil consumption will continue to grow and will reach 118 millio n barrels per day in 2030.2 About 43 percent of this growth in oil consumption will come from the non-Organization for Economic Co-operation and D evelopment Asian countries, includi ng China and India, but t he United St ates will remain the world's largest oil consu mer. In 2005 , the United States account ed for just under 25 percent of world oil consumption. World oil 1This number comes from EIA 's Monthly Energy Review (December 2006 ), table 11 .2. EIA labels this table as petr oleum cons umptio n, but DOE pointe d out in its com ments that the consumption data include some ethanol, which is not a petroleum produ ct. EIA staff told us that t he etha nol in the 2005 figure amo unts to 265 ,000 barrels per day , amounting to just unde r one-third of 1 percent of world cons umption. 2This projection comes fr om EI A's International Energy Out look 2006 and reflects assumptions used in EIA's refe rence case sce nario. To assess uncertainties in the referenc e case projection s, EIA also runs low and high oil price scena rios, in which the projected world oil c onsumption in 2030 is 102 million and 128 million barrels pe r day, respectively. Page 1 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion production has been ru nning at n ear capacit y in recent year s to meet rising consumption, putting upward pr essure on oil prices. T he potential for disruptio ns in key oil- producing r egions of th e world, such as the Middle East, and the yearly threat of hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico hav e also exerted upward pressure on oil prices. These conditions have renewed interest in a lo ng-standing question: Wi ll oil supply continue to expand to m eet growing demand, or will we soon reach a maximum possible level of production\u2014a peak\u2014beyond which oil supply can only decline? Historically, U.S. oil production peak ed around 1970 at close to 10 million barrels per day and has b een generall y declini ng ever since, to about 5 million barrels per day i n 2005. Whil e recent d iscoveries raise the prospect of some increases in U.S. oil producti on, significant reduction s in world oil production could still h ave important consequences for the nation's welfare. The United Stat es imported about 66 per cent of its oi l and petroleum products in 2005, and the U.S. economy\u2014particularly the transportation sector\u2014depends heavily on oil . Overall, trans portation accounts for approximately 65 percen t of U.S. oil consumption. New technologi es have b een i ntroduced t hat displace some oil consumption within the sector, but oi l consumpti on for transportation has continued to increase in r ecent years. According t o a 20 05 rep ort prepared for DOE, without timely preparati on, a reducti on in world oil producti on could cause transp ortation fuel shortages th at would translate into significant economic h ardship.3 The U.S. go vernment addresses or examines world oil supply in several ways. For example, DOE is responsib le for promoting the n ation's ener gy security through reliabl e and afford able en ergy, including oil . DOE supports development o f technologi es for producing and using oil and for making alter native fu els, such as ethanol or hydro gen. The department also publishes statistics on energy production an d consumption through EIA. In addition, the Unit ed States Ge ological Survey (USGS), within the Department of the Interi or (Int erior), assesses th e amount of oil throughout the world. The United States also is a member of the Internationa l Energy Age ncy (IEA), an organizati on of 26 me mber countries whose objecti ves include coping with disruptions in the oil 3Robert L.

In conductin g our work, we identified and revi ewed key studies on when oil producti on will peak. We revi ewed estimates of the amount of oil throughout the world and the amoun t of oil held by national oil companies, and we anal yzed forecas ts of politica l and inv estment risks in oil-producing regions. T o assess the potential for transportation technologi es in the United States to mitigate the consequen ces of a peak and decli ne in oil production, we examined options to develo p alternative fuels and technologies to reduce ener gy consumption in the tr ansportation sector. In particular, we focused on technologi es that would affect automobiles and light tr ucks. We co nsulted with experts to d evise a list o f key technol ogies in thes e areas and then reviewed DOE programs and activities rel ated to developing these technologi es. We did not attempt to comprehensively list all technologi es or to conduct a governmentwide review of all programs, and we limited our scope to what federal government officials kno w about the status of these technologies in the United States. We did no t conduct a global asses sment of transportation technologi es. We revi ewed numerous studies on the relations hip between oil and the global eco nomy and, in p articular, on the exp eriences of past oil price sho cks. To iden tify federal government a ctivities that could address peak oil production issues, we spoke with officials at DOE and USGS, and gathered info rmation on fe deral progr ams and policies that could affect uncertainty about the ti ming of peak oil production and the developmen t of alternati ve transportation techno logies. To g ain further insights into the federal role and oth er issues surrounding peak oil production, we convened an exp ert panel in conjunction with the Nation al Academy of Scienc es. Th ese experts commented on the poten tial economic consequences of a transiti on away fro m conventio nal oil, factors that could affe ct the severit y of the conse quences, and what the federal role should be, among other th ings. A more detailed description of the scope an d methodology of our review is presented in app endix I. We 4The Europea n Commission also part icipates in the w ork of IEA. Page 3 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion performed our work between July 2 005 and Dec ember 2006, in accorda nce with general ly ac cepted government auditing sta ndards. Most studies estimate that oil pr oduction will peak sometime between now and 2040, althou gh many of thes e projectio ns cover a w ide range of time, includi ng two studies for which the range extends into t he next century. Th e timing of the peak depends on multiple, uncertai n factors that will influence how quickly the remaining oil i s used, including the amount of oil still in the ground, how much of the remaining oil can be ultimately p roduced, an d future oil demand. Th e amount of oil remaining in the groun d is highly u ncertain, in part becaus e the Organi zation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OP EC) controls most of th e estimated world oil reserves, but its estimates of reserves are not verified by independent auditors. In addition, ma ny parts of t he world have not y et been fully explored for oil. There is also great u ncertainty about the amount of oil that will ultimately be produced, gi ven the technological, cost, and en vironmental challen ges. For example, some of the oil remaining in the ground can be accessed only by using complex and costly technologi es that present greater en vironmental challenges than the technologi es used for most of the oil produced to date. Other i mportant sources of uncertainty about futu re oil producti on are poten tially unfavorable political an d investment c onditions i n countries where oil is located. F or example, more than 6 0 percent of w orld oil reserves, on the basis of Oil and Gas Journal estimates, are in countries wh ere relativel y unstable pol itical conditi ons coul d constrain oil exploration and production. Finally, futu re world demand for oil also is uncertain becaus e it depends o n economic growth and government policies throughout the world. For example, con tinued rapid economic gr owth in China and Indi a could signifi cantly in crease world demand for oil, while envir onmental concerns, in cluding oil 's contribution to global w arming, may spur conservatio n or adoptio n of alternat ive fuels that would reduce future demand for oil. Results in Brief In the United States, alt ernative trans portation technologies f ace challenges t hat could im pede their ability to mitigate the consequences of a peak and d ecline in oil production, unless sufficient time an d effort are brought to b ear. For example: \u007f Ethanol from corn is more costly to produce than gasoline, i n part becau se of the high cost of the co rn feedstock . Even if eth anol were to become more cost-competitive with gasoline, it could not become widely avail able Page 4 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion es, storage fi lling stations. \u007f Advanced vehicle t echn ologies that could incre ase mileage o r use different fuels are gen erally more costly than conventional technologi es and have not been wi dely ado pted. For example, hybrid electric v ehicles can cost from $2,000 to $3,5 00 mo re to purcha se than comparable co nventional vehicles and currently co nstitute abo ut 1 perce nt of new vehic le registrations in the Unite d States. \u007f Hydrogen fu el cell vehicles are signifi cantly more costly than c onventional vehicles to produce. Spe cifically , the hydrogen fu el cell sta ck needed to power a veh icle currentl y costs abou t $35, 000 t o produce, in comparison with a conve ntional gas engine, which costs $2,00 0 to $3, 000. Given these challen ges, developmen t and widespread adoptio n of alternative t ransportation technologi es will take t ime and effort. Key alternative t echnologi es currently supply the equivalent of only about 1 percent of U .S. consumption of petro leum products, and DOE projects that even un der optimistic scenarios, by 2015 th ese technologies could displace onl y the e quivalent of 4 p ercent of projec ted U.S. ann ual consumption. Under these circumstan ces, an im minent peak and sharp decline i n oil production could have severe cons equences, in cluding a worldwide recession. If t he peak comes later, ho wever, these technologi es have a great er potential to mitigate the consequ ences. DOE projects that these techn ologies coul d displace u p to the e quivalent of 34 percent of projected U. S. annual consumption of petroleum products in the 2025 through 203 0 time frame, assuming the chall enges the techno logies fac e are overcom e. The l evel of effort ded icated to overcoming ch allenges to alternative t echnologi es will depend in part on the price of oil ; without sustained high oil prices , efforts to develop and adopt alternatives may fal l by the waysi de. Federal agency efforts t hat could reduce uncertainty about the timing of peak oil pro duction or mitigate its consequen ces are sprea d across multiple agencies and generally are not focused explicitly on peak oil. For example, eff orts that could be used t o reduce un certainty about the timing of a peak in clude USGS activities to estimate oil resources and DOE efforts to monitor current supply an d demand conditions in global oil markets and to make fut ure projecti ons. Similarly, DOE, the Department of Transportation (DOT), and the U.S. Department of Agricultu re (USDA) all have programs and activities th at oversee or promote alternative transportation technolo gies that co uld mitigate t he consequ ences of a Page 5 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion peak. However, officials of key agen cies we spoke with ack nowledge th at their efforts\u2014with the exception of some studies\u2014are not specifical ly designed to address peak oil. Fede rally sponsored studies we reviewed have expressed a growing conc ern o ver the pote ntial for a pe ak and officials from key agen cies have i dentified some options for addressing this issue. For example, DOE and USGS officials told us that developin g better information about worldwide demand and supply and i mproving global estimates for non convention al oil resources and oil in \"frontier\" regions that have yet to be fully expl ored could h elp prepare f or a peak i n oil producti on by reduci ng uncertain ty about its t iming. Agen cy offici als also said tha t, in the e vent of an imminent peak , they coul d step up efforts to mitigate t he consequ ences by, for example, fur ther encour aging developmen t and adopti on of alternative fuels an d advan ced vehicle technologi es. However, according to DOE, there is no formal strategy for coordinating and prioritizing federal efforts deali ng with pea k oil issues, either within DOE or between DOE and other ke y agencies. While the consequenc es of a pea k would be felt globally, the United Stat es, as the larges t consumer of oil and on e of the n ations most he avily dependent on oil for transportation, may be parti cularly vul nerable. Therefore, t o better pre pare the Uni ted States fo r a peak and decline in o il production, we are reco mmending that the Secretary of Energy take th e lead, in coor dination with other releva nt federal agencies, to establish a peak oil strategy. Su ch a strategy should include efforts to reduce uncertainty about the ti ming of a peak in oil pro duction and provide timely advice to Co ngress about cost-effecti ve measures to mitigate t he potential consequen ces of a pe ak. In commenting on a draft of the repo rt, the Departments of Energy and the Inte rior generall y agre ed with the report and recommendations. Oil\u2014the product of the b urial and transformation of biomass over the l ast 200 million years\u2014has historically had no equal as an energy source for its intrinsic qualities of extractability, tr ansportability, versatility, and cost. But the total amount of oil undergrou nd is finite, and, therefo re, production will one day reach a peak and then b egin to declin e. Such a peak may b e involuntary if supply is unable to k eep up with growing demand. Alternatively, a production peak cou ld be brought about by voluntary reductions in oil consumption before physical limits to continued s upply growth kick in. No t surprisingly, concerns have arisen i n recent years about the relationship b etween (1) the growing consumption of oil and the availability of oil reserv es and (2) the impact of potentially dwindling supplies and rising prices on the world's economy and social Background Page 6 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion welfare. Foll owing a peak in world oil production , the rate of production would event ually de crea se and, ne cessarily, so would the rate of consumption of oil. Oil can be fo und and pro duced from a variet y of sources. To d ate, world oil producti on has come almost exclusi vely from what are co nsidered to be \"conventi onal sources\" of oil. Whil e there is no universally agreed-upon definition of what is meant by con ventional sources, IEA states that convention al sources can be pr oduced using tod ay's mainstream technologi es, compared with \"nonconventional s ources\" that require more complex or more expensive technol ogies to extr act, such as oil sands an d oil shale. Di stinguishing between co nventional and nonconventional oil sources is important because the additional cost and technol ogical challen ges surrounding production of nonconventional sources make these resources more uncertain. Ho wever, this distinction is further complicated because wh at is consider ed to be a mainstream technology can ch ange over time. F or example, offshore oil deposits were considere d to be a non conventional source 50 years ago; however, toda y they are considered convention al. For the pu rpose of this report, and consistent with IEA's classification, we define n onconventio nal sources as including oil sands, he avy oil depo sits, and oil shale.5 Some oil is being p roduced from these nonconventio nal sources t oday. For ex ample, in 2005 Canad a produced about 1.6 milli on barrels pe r day of oil from oil sands, and Venezuelan production of extra-heavy oil for 2005 was projected to be about 600,000 barrels per day. Curren tly, however , production from these sources is very small compared with total world oil producti on. According t o IEA, most countries outside the Middle East have reached their peak in conventional oil production, or will do so in the near future. The United States is a case in point. Even though the United States is currently the third-largest, oil-producing nation,6 U.S. oil production peaked arou nd 197 0 and has been on a declini ng trend ever si nce. (Se e fig. 1.) Oil Production Has Peaked in the Uni ted States and Most Other Countries Outside the Middle East 5The distinction as to w hat portion of heavy oil is conventional is debated by expe rts. For example, c ontrary to the IEA definition, USGS considers the heavy oil pr oduced in California as conventio nal oil. 6Saudi A rabia a nd R ussia, res pectively, lead in world oil p roduction.

However, this increase will end abo ut 2016, and then U.S. pr oduction will continue to decline. Given these pro jections, it is clear that future increases in U.S. demand for oil will need to be ful filled through increases in productio n in the rest of the world. Increasing production i n other countries has to date been able to mo re than make up for decl ining U.S. production and has resu lted in increasing world production. (See fig. 2.)

Oil Is Critical in Satisfying the U.S. and W orld Demand for Energy Oil accounts for approximately one-t hird of all th e energy used in the world. Following the rec ord oil price s associated with the Iranian Revolution i n 1979-80 and with the start of the Ira n-Iraq war in 198 0, there was a drop in total world oil consumption, from about 63 million barrels per day in 1980 to 59 mil lion barrels per day in 1983. Si nce th en, however , world consumption of petroleum pro ducts has in creased, tot aling abo ut 84 million barrels per day i n 2005. In the United States, consumption of petroleum products increased an aver age of 1.65 percent ann ually from 1983 to 2004, and aver aged 20. 6 million barrels per day in 2005, representing about one- quarter of all world consumption. EIA projects that U.S. consumption will continue to increase and will reach 27.6 million barrels per day in 2 030. As figure 3 shows, the transportation sector is by far the largest U.S. consumer of petroleum, accountin g for two-third s of all U.S. consumption and relying almost entirely on p etroleum to operate. Within t he transportation sector, li ght vehi cles are the larg est consumers of Page Peak Oil Produc petroleum energy,7 accou nting for proximately 60 o f the transportation sector's consumption of petroleu m-based energy in the United States.

Recent world productio n of oil has been running at near cap acity to meet ri sing demand, which has put upward pressure on oil prices.

All else bein g equ al, oil consumption is inversely correlated with oil price, with higher oil prices in ducing c onsumers to reduce their oil consumption.8 Specifi cally, incre ases in crude oil prices are re flected in the prices of products made from cr ude oil, in cluding gasoli ne, diesel, home heatin g oil, and petrochemical s. The exten t to which c onsumers are 8Oil cons umptio n als o depends on other factor s; theref ore, it i s sometimes difficult to isolate the cha nges in consum ption ca used by changes in oi l prices. For e xample, gasoline cons umptio n generally increa ses as incomes rise and people cho ose to driv e more . In addition, highe r incomes mea n that oil play s a smaller role i n a consumer 's budget , and, therefore , higher-income consumers may be less sensitive to changes in oil prices than lower-income c onsumers . Page 11 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion willing and able to reduce their cons umption of oil in response to price increases de pends on th e cost of switch ing to activities and li festyles that use less oil. Because the re are more options avai lable in th e longer term, consumers respond more to changes in oil prices in the longer term than in the shorte r term. For example, in the short term, consume rs can reduce oil consumption by drivi ng less or more slowly, but in the lo nger term, consumers can still take those actions, but can al so buy more fuel-effici ent automobiles or even mo ve closer to where they work and thereby furthe r reduce their oil consumption. Supply and demand, in t urn, affect t he type of oi l that is produced. Conventional oil that is l ess expensiv e to extract using lower-cost drilling techniques will be produced when oil pr ices are lower. Conversely, oil that is expensive to produce because of t he higher cost technologies involved may not be economical to produce at low oil prices. Producer s are unlikely to t urn to these more expens ive oil sources unless oil prices are sustained at a high enough level t o make such an enterprise profitable. Given the importance of oil in the wo rld's energy portfolio, as cheaper oil reserves are exhausted i n the future, nations will need to make the transition to more and more expensi ve and difficult-to-access sources of oil to meet e nergy dema nds. Recentl y, for examp le, a l arge di scovery of o il in the Gulf o f Mexico made headli nes; however, t his potential wealth of oi l is located at a depth of o ver 5 miles b elow sea lev el, a fact tha t adds significantly to the costs of extractin g that oil. Most studies estimate that oil pr oduction will peak sometime between now and 2040, althou gh many of thes e projectio ns cover a w ide range of time, includi ng two studies for which the range extends into t he next century.9 Key uncertaintie s in trying to determine the timing of peak oil are the (1) amount of oil throughout the world; (2) technological, cost, and environmental chall enges to produce that oil; (3) political an d investment risk factors that may affect oil explor ation and pr oduction; an d (4) future world dema nd for oil. T he uncertain ties related t o exploratio n and Timing of Peak Oil Production Depends on Uncertain F actors 9One key differe nce between the st udies is in how much oil they assume is still in the grou nd. Some s tudies cons ider a pea k in conventional oil, while other s tudies cons ider a peak in total oil, includin g conventional an d nonco nventional oils. Becaus e of thes e differences in t he pea k conce pt used in t he various studies, we have not att empted t o define a peak a s either a peak in conve ntional oil o r conventi onal plus nonconventio nal oils.

These factors would caus e such unce rtainty rega rdles s of w hethe r the peak c oncept focused on conventional or t otal oil.

Es timates of how much oil remains in the ground are highly un certain becaus e much of these data are self- reported an d unverified by indep endent auditors; many parts of the world have yet to be fully expl ored for oil; and there is no comprehensive assessment of oil reserves from nonc onvention al sources. This uncertai nty surrounding estimates of oil resources in the grou nd comprises the uncertainty surrounding estimates of proven reserves10 as well as uncertainty surrounding expect ed in creases in th ese reserves and estimated future oil discoveries. Amount of Oil in the Ground Is Uncertai n Oil and Gas Journal and World Oil, two primary sources of proven reserves estimates, compile data on proven reserves from national and private com pany source s. Some of this informat ion is publicly available from oil companies that are subject to public reporting requ irements\u2014for example, inf ormation provided b y companies that are publicl y traded on U.S. stock exchanges that are subject to the filing requirements of U.S. federal secu rities laws. Information f iled pursuan t to these laws is subjec t to liability st andards, and, therefore, there is a st rong incenti ve for these companies to make sure their disclo sures are complete and accurate . On the other ha nd, compani es that are n ot subject to these feder al securities laws, including compani es wholly owned by var ious OPEC countries where the majority of reserves are lo cated, are not subject to t hese filing requirements and their related li abili ty standards. Some expe rts believe OPEC estimates of prov en reserves t o be inflat ed. For example, OPEC estimates increased shar ply in the 1980s, corresponding to a change in OPEC's quota rules that l inked a member country's producti on quota in part to its remaining proven reserves . In addition, many OPEC countries' reported reserves remained relativ ely unchan ged during the 1 990s, e ven as they continu ed high l evels of oil production. For example, IEA reports that reserves estimates in Kuwait were unchang ed from 1991 to 2002, even though the country produced more than 8 billion barrels of oil over that period and d id not make any important new oil di scoveries. At a 2005 10Proven reserves are clas sified as oil in the ground that is likel y to be ec onom ically producible at expected oil prices and given expected technologies. Conve ntional reserves are ofte n classified according to the degree of certainty t hat they exist and can be extracte d profitably. Eve n this clas sification is fraug ht with uncertaint y becaus e there are no harmonized rul es about the assumptions to be used whe n determining this profitability. Page 14 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion National Academy of Sciences workshop on peak oil, OPEC defended its reserves estimates as accurate. The potential unr eliability of OPEC's self- reported dat a is particul arly problematic with respect to pr edicting th e timing of a p eak because OPEC holds most of the world's current estimated proven oil rese rves. On the basis of Oil and Gas Journal estimates as of January 2006 , we fou nd that of th e approximately 1. 1 trillion barrels of proven oil reserves worldwide,11 about 80 per cent are located in the OPEC countries,12 compared with ab out 2 perc ent in the United State s. Figure 6 s hows this estimate in more detail. 11As previous ly discussed in this report, there is no univers ally agreed-up on definition of conventional oi l. The Oil and Gas Journa l includes Can adian oil sand s in its estimates. IEA classifie s oil sands as nonconventional, and, theref ore, since we are using the IEA classif ication thro ugho ut this report , we have remove d the Oil and Gas Jou rnal estimate of 174 billion barrels of oil from the Ca nadia n oil sands data . USGS experts emphasized the importance of these oil s ands in future oil pr oduction and sta ted that in their view, these resources a re now considere d to be conventional. 12OPEC's membe rs are Algeria , Indonesia, Ira n, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Q atar, Saudi Arabia, t he United Ara b Emira tes, and Venezu ela. Beginning with January 2 007 data, new OPEC member Angola would a lso be in cluded in OPEC reserves estimates.

Oil resources estimates are significa ntly higher b ecause th ey estimate the world's total oil resource base, rather than just what is now proven to be economicall y producible. USGS estima tes of the resource base include past production and curr ent reserves as well as the potential for future increases in current con ventional o il reserves\u2014often referred to as reserves growth\u2014and the amount of estimated co nventional oil that has the potential to be add ed to these reserves.13 Estimates of reserves growth and those re sources that have th e potential to b e added to oil reserves are important in determining when oil production may peak. However, 13USGS defines c onventional oil accumulati on based primarily on ge ology. The time horizon for these data is 30 ye ars. This d efinit ion d oes not incorp orate ec onomic or political factors, such as deepwater, rem otene ss, harsh clim ate, reg ulatory status, or engineering tec hniques. Not include d in this USGS definitio n are oil s ands and oil shale. Interior's Mine rals Management Service overs ees oil pr oducti on on federal la nds offs hore. Officials from the Minerals Ma nagement Service stated in c omments on a draft of t his report that , wit h rega rd to some offshore areas, resou rce estimates are based on data that are 20 t o 25 years old. They als o poin ted out that resource es timates can change dramatically with improvements to technolog y and information. Page 16 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion estimating these potenti al future reserves is complicated b y the fact th at many region s of the world have not b een fully explored and, as a result, there is limited information. For exa mple, in its 2000 assessment, USGS provides a mean estimate of 73 2 bill ion barrels that hav e the potential to be added as newly discovered con ventional oil, with as muc h as 25 p ercent from the Arc tic\u2014includi ng Greenlan d, Northern Canada, and the Russian portion of the Barents Se a. However, relatively little exploratio n has been done in this region, and there are l arge portions of the world where the potential for oil producti on exists, but where expl oration has not been done. Accor ding to USGS, there is less uncertainty in regions where wells have b een d rilled, but even in the Un ited States, one of the areas that has seen the gre atest explor ation, some areas hav e not been full y explored, as illustrated by the recent discovery of a potenti ally large oil fi eld in the G ulf of Mexico. Limited information on oil-producing regions worldwide also leads USGS to base its estimate of reserves gr owth on how reserves estimates have grown in the United Stat es. How ever, some expe rts criticize this methodology; they believe such an estimate may be too high because th e U.S. experie nce ov erestimates increa ses in future worldwide reserves. In contrast, EIA believes t he USGS estimate may be too low. In 2005, USGS released a st udy showing that its pred iction of res erves growth has been i n line with the world's experience fro m 1996 to 2003.14 Given such controversy, uncertainty remains about this key element of estimating the amount of oil in the grou nd. In 2000, USGS' most recent full assessment of the world's key oil re gions, the ag ency provide d a range of es timates of remaining world convent ional oil res ources. The mean of this range was a t about 2. 3 trillion barrels comprising about 890 bi llion barrels in current reserves and 1.4 trillion b arrels that have th e potential to be added to oil reserves in the future.15 Further contributing to t he uncertain ty of the timi ng of a p eak is the lack of a comprehensive assessment of oil from nonconventional sources. For example, th e three ke y sources of oil estimates\u2014 Oil and Gas Journal, 14T.R. Klett, Donald L. Ga utier, and Thomas S. Ahlbrandt, \"An Evaluation of the U.S. Geological Survey World P etroleum Assessm ent 2000,\" Ameri , no.8 (August Ahlbran dt, Ronald rpentier, T.R. ames W. Schm oker, Gregory F. Ulmis hek, Globa l Resou rce Esti mates from Total Petroleum Systems (The American Association of Petroleum Geologist s: Tulsa, Oklahoma, 2005 ). Page 17 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion World Oil, and USGS\u2014d o not gen erally includ e oil from nonconventional sources. This is an important i ssue because oil from nonconventional sources is thought to exi st in large quantities. Fo r example, I EA believes that oil from nonconvent ional sources\u2014 compose d primarily of Canadian oil sands, ex tra-heavy oil deposits in Venezuela, and oil shale i n the United States\u2014could account for as much as 7 trillion barrels of oil, which could greatly d elay the onset of a peak in production. However, IEA also points out that the amount of this nonconven tional oil t hat will even tually be produced is highly un certain, which i s a result of the chall enges facing thi s production. Despite this uncertainty, USGS experts noted that Canadian oil sands an d Venezuelan extra-heavy oil product ion are under way now and also suggested that proven re serves from these sources will be growing con siderably in the immediate future. Uncertainty Remains about How Much Oil Can Be Produced from Proven Reserves, Hard-to- Reach Locations , and Nonconventional Sources It is also difficult to proj ect the timin g of a p eak i n oil production because technologi cal, cost, and environmenta l chall enges make it unclear how much oil can ultimately be recovered from (1) p roven reserves, (2) hard- to-reach locations, and ( 3) nonconventional sources. To increase the recov ery rate from oil reserves, c ompanies turn to enhanced oi l recovery (EOR) technologies, which DOE reports has the potential to i ncrease rec overy rates f rom 30 to 50 percent in many locations. T hese technol ogies includ e injectin g steam or heat ed water; gases, such as carbon di oxide; or ch emicals into the reservoi r to stimulate oil flow and allow for increased reco very. Opport unities for EOR have been most aggressively pursued in the United St ates, EOR technologies currently co ntribute app roximately 12 percent to U.S. production, and carbon dioxi de EOR alone is projected to have th e potential to provide at least 2 million barrels per day by 20 20. However, technologi cal advan ces, such as bett er seismic and fluid-m onitoring techniques for reservoirs during an E OR injection, may be req uired to make these te chniques more cost-effective. Furthermore, EOR technologies are much costlier than th e convention al production methods used for the vast majority of oil produced. C osts are higher because of the capit al cost of equi pment and operating co sts, including the producti on, transportation, and injection of agents into e xisting field s and the ad ditional en ergy costs of p erforming these tasks. Finally, EOR technologi es have the p otential to create environmental conc erns associated with the add itional energ y required to conduct an EOR injection and the greenhouse gas emissions associated with producing that ener gy, altho ugh EIA has stated that thes e environmental costs may be less than those imposed by produ cing oil in previously u ndevelop ed areas. Even if sustained high oil pric es make EOR Page 18 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion technologi es cost-effecti ve for an oil company, th ese chall enges and costs may deter th eir widespread use. The timing o f peak oil is also difficult to estimate because n ew sources of oil could be increasingly more remote and costly to exploit, in cluding offshore production of oi l in deepwat er and ultra- deepwater. Worldwide, industry analysts report that deepwat er (depths of 1,000 to 5,000 feet) and ultra-deepwater (5,000 t o 10,000 f eet) drilling eff orts are concentrated offshore in Africa, Latin America, and North America, an d capital expenditure s for these efforts are expected to grow through at least 2 011. In the United States, deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico, cou ld reach 2.2 million barrels per day i n 2016, according to EIA estimates. However , accessing and producin g oil from these locati ons present several ch allenges. At de epwater dep ths, penetrating the earth and efficien tly operating dr illing equipment is difficult bec ause of the extreme pre ssure and temperature. In addition, these condit ions can co mpro mise the endurance and reliabili ty of operating e quipment. Operating costs for deepwat er rigs are 3. 0 to 4. 5 times mo re than operating costs for typical shallo w water rigs. Capital costs, includ ing platforms and under water pipeline infrastructures, are also greater. Finally, deepwater a nd ultra-deepwater drilling efforts generall y face similar environmental concerns as shallow wat er drilling efforts, although some deepwater op erations may pose great er environmental conc erns to se nsitive deepwater ecosystems. It is unclear how much oil can b e recovered from nonconvent ional sources. Recovery from thes e sources could delay a peak in o il productio n or slow the rate of declin e in pr oducti on after a p eak. Expert sources disagree con cerning the significance of the role t hese noncon ventional sources will play in the f uture. DOE officials we spoke with emphasized the belief t hat nonconventional oil will play a significant role in the ver y near future as conventio nal oil produ ction is una ble to meet t he increasin g demand for oil. However, IEA estima tes of oil production have convention al oil continui ng to comprise almost all of producti on through 2030. Currently, producti on of oil fr om key nonconventional sources of oil\u2014oil sands, heavy and extra-hea vy oil deposits, and oil e\u2014is more costly and p resents envi ronmental challeng es. Oil sands are deposits of bitumen, a t hick, sticky form of crude oil, that is so heavy and viscous it will not flow unless heat ed. While m ost convention al crude oil fl ows naturally or is pumped from the ground, oil sands must be mined or recovered \"i n-situ,\" before being converted into an upgraded cr ude oil that can be used by refineries to produce gasoline and Oil Sands Page 19 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion diesel fuels. Alberta, Can ada, co ntain s at least 85 percent of t he world's proven oil s ands reserves. In 2005, worldwide production of oil sands, largely from Alberta, contributed ap proximately 1.6 million barrels of oil per day, and production is projected to grow to as much as 3.5 million barrels per day by 2030. Oil sand dep osits are also located domestically in Alabama, Alaska, Califor nia, Tex as, and Utah. Production from oil sands, however, presents significant en vironmental challenges. The production process uses large amou nts of na tural gas, which generates greenhouse gases when burned. In addition, la rge-scale prod uction of oil sands requires significant qu antities of wa ter, typicall y produce lar ge qu antities of contaminated wastewater, and alter the natur al landscap e. These challen ges may ultimately limit produc tion from this resou rce, even if sustained high oil prices make production profitable. Heavy a nd extra-heav y oils are dense , viscous oil s that gener ally require advanced pr oduction technologies, s uch as EOR, and substan tial processing to be con verted into petr oleum products. Heavy and extra- heavy oils di ffer in their viscosities and other phy sical properties, but advanc ed recovery t echniques like EOR are required for both types of oi l. Known extra-heav y oil d eposits are primarily in Venezuela\u2014a lmost 90 percent of t he world's proven extra- heavy oil res erves. Venez uelan production of extra-heavy oil was projected to be 600,000 barrels of oil per day in 2005 and is projected to be su stained at t his rate through 2040. Heavy oil can be found i n Alaska, Calif ornia, and Wyoming an d may exist in other cou ntries besides the United States and Venezuela. Like production f rom oil sands, however, heavy oil pr oduction in t he United States presents environmental chall enges in its consumption of other energy sour ces, which contributes to greenhous e gases, an d potential groundwater contamination from the in jectants needed to thin the oil enough so t hat oil will flow through pipes. Heavy and Extra-Heavy Oils Oil shale is sedimentary rock contain ing solid bit uminous ma terials that release petr oleum-like li quids when the rock is heated. The world's largest known oil shale dep osit covers portions of Colorado, Utah, and Wyoming, but other co untries, such as Australia and Morocco, also cont ain oil shale resources. Oil shale prod uction is un der consideration in the United States, but considerable doubts remain concernin g its ultimate techni cal and commercial feasibility. Producti on fr om oil shale is energy-intensive, requiring ot her energy sources to he at the shale t o about 900 to 1,000 degrees Fah renheit to ex tract the oil. Furthermore, oil shale p roduction is projected to contaminate local surfac e water with salts and to xics that leach from spent shale. These factor s may limit the amount o f oil from Oil Shale Page 20 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion shale that can be produced, even if oi l prices are s ustained at high enou gh levels to offs et the add itional production costs. More detailed information on these t echnologi es is provided i n appendix III. Political and Investment Risk Factors Create Uncertainty about the Future Rate of Oil Explorati on and Producti on Political and investment risk factors also could af fect future o il exploration and product ion and, ulti mately, the t iming of peak oil production. These factor s include ch anging p olitical conditi ons and investment climates in many countries that have l arge proven oil reserves. Experts we spoke with told us that t hey considered these factors important in affecting fut ure oil explo ration and p roduction. In many cou ntries with proven reserves, oil produ ction could be shut down by wars, strikes, and other pol itical e vents, thus reduci ng the flow of oil to the world market. If these ev ents occurred repeatedl y, or in many different locations, they could constrain explorati on and prod uction, resulting in a peak despi te the existe nce of prov en oil reserve s. For example, according to a news accou nt, crude oil output in Iraq dropped from 3.0 million barrels per day before the 1990 gulf war to about 2.0 million barrels per day i n 2006, and a labor strike in the Venezuelan oil sector led to a drop in exports to th e United States of 1.2 million barrels. Although th ese were isolated and temporary oil supply disruptions, if enough similar events occurred with sufficient frequency, the overall impact coul d constrain production capaci ty, thus making it impossible for supply to ex pand alon g with demand for oil. Using a measure of political risk that assesses the likelihood that events such as civil wars, coups, and labor strikes will occur i n a magnitude sufficient to reduce a country's gross domestic product ( GDP) growth rate over t he next 5 years,16 we found that f our countries\u2014Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, an d Venezuela\u2014that possess pro ven oil reser ves greater t han 10 billion barrels (high reserves) also face hi gh levels of p olitical risk .

Even in the United State s, political c onsiderations may affect the rate of exploration and product ion. For example, restrictions imposed to protect environmental assets mean that some oil may no t be produced. Interior's Minerals Ma nagement S ervice estimates that ap proximately 76 billion barrels of oil lie in undiscovered field s offshore in the U.S. out er continental shelf. However, Congres s has enacted moratoriu ms on drillin g and explorat ion in this area to prot ect coastlines f rom unintended oil 17Because we examined a f orec ast of risk fact ors, it would have been ideal to have a forecast of wha t oil reserves are likely to be in each c ountry f or the next 5 years, including reserve growth and potential f uture discoveri es. However, s uch reserve pre dictions are not publicly available, and, the refore, we used p ublished count ry-level data on proven reserve s from the Oil and Gas Journa l. Consistent with our previou s presentation of proven reserves, the information we present he re does not incl ude C anadian oil sands data. Page 22 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion spills. In addition, policies on federal land use need to take int o account multiple uses of the land, in cluding environmental protection.18 Environmental restrictions may affect a peak in o il productio n by barring oil explorati on and prod uction in environmentally sensitive a reas. Foreign investment in the oil sector could be n ecessary to bring oil to the world mark et,19 accordin g to studies we reviewed and exp erts we consulted, b ut many cou ntries have r estricted foreign inv estment. Lac k of investment could hasten a peak in oil production because th e proper infrastructure might not be available to find and p roduce oil when need ed, and because technical ex pertise may be lackin g. The important role foreign investment plays in oil produ ction is illustrated in Kazakhstan, where the National Commission on Energy Poli cy found th at opening th e energy secto r to foreign i nvestment in the earl y 1990s led to a doubling in oil producti on between 1998 and 2002.20 In additi on, we foun d that direct foreign investment in Venezuela was strongly correlated with oil production i n that count ry, and that when foreign investment declined between 2001 and 2004, oil producti on also decli ned.21 Industry officials told us that l ack of techn ical exp ertise could l ead to less sophisticated drilling techniques that actually reduce the abilit y to recover oil in more complex reservoirs. For example, ac cording to in dustry officials, some Russian wells have diffic ulties with high water cu t\u2014that is, a high ratio of water to oil\u2014making oil difficult to get out of th e ground at current prices. This water cut problem stems from not using tec hnically advanced methods wh en the wells were initially drilled. We have pr eviously reported that the Ven ezuelan nati onal PDVS A, lost techn ical exp ertise when it fired thousands of employees following a strike in 2002 and 2003. In contrast, other nation al oil companies, such as Saudi Aramco, are widely perc eived to possess considerable techni cal exp ertise. Investment Climate Creates Uncertainty about Oil Exploration and Production 18GAO, Oil and Gas Develop ment: Increased Permi tting Acti vity Has tment in explo ration and productio n would need to total about $2 .25 trillion from 2 004 through 20 30.

(See fig. 8.) For example, over one-th ird of the world's proven oil reserves lie in only five countries \u2014China, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela\u2014 all of which have a high l ikelihood of seeing a wor sening investment climate.

National oil companies may have additional motivations for producing oi l, other than meeting con sumer dema nd. For instance, some countries use some profits from national companie s to support domestic socioeconomi c developmen t, rather tha n focusing o n continued developmen t of oil exploration and product ion for worldwid e consumption. Given the amou nt of oil contro lled by n ational oil comp anies, these types of acti ons have th e potential to result in oil production t hat is not op timized to respond to increases in the demand for oil. In addition, the top 8 oil companies ranked by proven oil reserves are national co mpanies in OPEC-member countries, and OPEC decisions could affect future oil ex ploration an d productio n. For example, in some Page 25 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion cases, OPEC countries might decid e to limit current productio n to increase pri ces or to pre serve oil an d its revenue for future generations.

Future W orld Demand for Oil Is Uncertai n Uncertainty about future demand for oil\u2014which will influence how quickly th e remaining oil is used\u2014contributes to the uncertai nty about th e timing of peak oil production. EIA projects that oil will continue to be a major sourc e of energy well into th e future, with world consumption of petroleum products growing to 118 milli on barrels per day b y 2030. Fi gure 11 shows world petroleum product c onsumption by region for 2003 and EIA's projections for 203 0. As the fig ure shows, EIA projects that consumption will increase across all regions of the world, but members of Page 26 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developmen t (OECD) North America,22 which includes the U nited States, and non-OECD Asia, which inclu des China a nd India, are the major drivers of this growth.

Specific ally: \u007f Economic growth drives demand for oil. For example, accor ding to IEA, in 2003 the world experien ced strong g rowth in oil consumption of 2.0 percent, wit h even stron ger growth of 3.6 p ercent in 200 4, fro m 79.8 22OECD is a roup of shari ng a ommitment to democ ratic government and a ma rket economy.

EIA projects the Chi nese economy will continue to grow, but factors such as the speed of reform of ineffectiv e state-owned companies and the d evelopment of capital markets adds uncertainty to such projections and, as a result, t o the lev el of future oil demand in China. \u007f Future gove rnment policy c an also affect oil d emand. For example, environmental concerns about gasol ine's emissio ns of carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, may enco urage future reductions i n oil deman d if these conc erns are translated in to policies that promote biofuels. \u007f Consumer c hoices abou t conservati on also can affect oil d emand and thereby infl uence th e timing of a pe ak. For exa mple, if U.S. consumers were to purchase more fuel-efficie nt vehicles in greater numbers, this could reduce future oil demand in t he United St ates, potenti ally del aying a time at which oil supply is unable to keep pace w ith oil demand. Such unc ertainties that l ead to c hanges in future oil demand ultimately make estimates of the ti ming of a peak uncertain, as is illustrated in an EIA study on peak oil.23 Specifi cally, usin g future annual increases in world oil consumption, ranging fr om 0 percen t, to represent no increase, to 3 percent, to r epresent a la rge increas e, and out of t he various s cenarios examined, E IA estimated a window of up to 75 years for when the peak may occur. Factors that create un certainty about the timing of the peak\u2014in particular, factors that affect oil exploration and productio n\u2014also create uncertain ty about the rate of production declin e after the peak. For example, IEA reported that technology played a key role in slo wing the decline and extending th e life of oil production in the North Sea. Uncertai nty about th e rate of decl ine is illustrated in studies that estimate the timing of a peak. IEA, for example, estimates that this decline will range somewhere between 5 p ercent and 11 percent annually. Othe r studies assume the rate of decline in production after a peak will be the same as the ri se in production t hat occurred before the peak. Anoth er methodology, Factors That Create Uncertainty about the Timing of the Peak Also Create Uncertainty about the Rate of Decline 23John H. Wood, Gary R . Long , and David F . Moreho use, Long Term Wo rld Oil Supply Scenarios: The Futu re Is Neither as Bleak or Rosy as Some Assert, Energy Information Adminis tration, U.S. Depa rtme nt of Energy (2004). Page 28 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion employed by EIA, assumes that the resulting decline will act ually be faster than the rise in producti on that occu rred before t he peak . The rate of decline after a peak is an important c onsideration because a decline th at is more abrupt will likely h ave more ad verse econo mic consequ ences than a decline th at is less abrupt. In the United States, alt ernative tr ansportation technologies h ave limited potential to mitigate the consequen ces of a pe ak and decli ne in oil production, at least in th e near term, because th ey face many challen ges that will take time and effort to overcome. If the peak and decline in oil production occur befor e these tech nologies are advanced en ough to substantially offset the d ecline, t he consequenc es could be s evere. If th e peak occurs in the more distant future, however, alternative t echnologi es have a great er potential to mitigate t he consequ ences. Developmen t and widespread adoptio n of the seven alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies we exam ined will take time, and significant challen ges will have to be overcom e, according to DOE. These technologi es include ethanol, biodies el, biomass gas-to-liquid, coal gas-to- liquid, natur al gas and natural gas vehicles, ad vanced vehicle technologi es, and hydrog en fuel ce ll vehicles. Ethanol is an alcohol-b ased fuel pro duced by fer menting plant sugars. Currently, most ethanol i n the United States is made from corn, but ethanol also can be mad e from cellulosic matter from a variety of agricultural products, including trees, gr asses, and forestry residues. Corn ethanol has been used as an additiv e to gasoline for many ye ars, but it is also avail able as a prima ry fuel, mo st commonly as a blend ed mix of 85 percent eth anol and 1 5 percent g asoline. As a pri mary fuel, c orn ethanol i s not currently available o n a large na tional scale and federal agencies do not consider it to be cost-competitive with gasoline or diesel. The cost of corn feedsto ck, which accounts for approximately 75 p ercent of the production cost, is not projected to f all dramatically in th e future, in part, because of competing de mands for agricultural l and use and competing uses for corn, primarily as livestock feed, a ccord ing to DOE and USDA. DOE and USDA project that more cel lulosic ethanol could ult imately be produced th an corn eth anol beca use cellulosic et hanol can be produced from a variety of feedsto cks, but more fundament al reduction s in Alternative Transportation Technol ogies Face Challenges in Mitigating the Consequences of the Peak and Decli ne Development and Adoption of T echnologies to Displace Oil W ill Take Time and Effort Ethanol Page 29 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion production costs will be needed to make cellul osic ethanol commercially viable. Prod uction of eth anol from cellu losic feed stocks is currently more costly than production of corn ethanol because the cellulosi c material must first be broken down into fermentable sugar s that can b e converted into ethanol. The production costs associated with this additi onal processing would have to be reduc ed in order fo r cellulosic e thanol to be cost-competitive with ga soline at tod ay's prices. In addition, corn and c ellulosic etha nol are more corrosive th an gasoline , and the wid espread co mmercializa tion of these fuels would require substantial retrofitting of the refu eling infrastructure\u2014pipelines, storage tanks, and fi lling station s. To store ethanol, gasoline stations may have to retrofit or replace th eir storage tanks , at an estimated cost of $100 ,000 per tank. DOE officials also reported tha t some private firms consider capital investment in ethanol ref ineries to be risky for significant inv estment, unless the future of alter native fu els becomes more certain. F inally, widespread use of ethan ol would requ ire a turno ver in the vehicle fle et because mo st current vehicle en gines cannot eff ectivel y bur n ethanol in high con centrations. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that has similar prop erties to pet roleum diesel but can be produced from veget able oils o r animal fats. It is currently used in small q uantities in t he United St ates, but it is not cost- competitive with gasoline or diesel. The cost of biodiesel feedstocks\u2014 which in the United Stat es largely consist of soybean oil\u2014are the largest component of productio n costs. The price of soybean oil is n ot expect ed to decrease significantly in the futur e owing to c ompeting de mands from the food ind ustry and from soap and detergent m anufacturers. These competing d emands, as well as the li mited land a vailabl e for t he production of feedstock s, also are proj ected to limit biodiesel's capacity for large-vol ume production, according to DOE and USDA. As a result, experts beli eve th at the total production capacit y of biodiesel is ultimately limited compared with other alternat ive fuels. Biomass gas-to-liquid (bi omass GTL ) is a fuel produced from biomass feedstocks b y gasifyin g the feedstoc ks into an in termediary product, referred to as syngas, bef ore converti ng it into a diesel-like fuel. This fuel is not commercially prod uced, a nd a number of technologi cal and economic challenges would need to be over come for commercial viabil ity. These chall enges include identifying biomass feedstocks that are suitable for efficient conversion t o a syngas and devel oping effecti ve methods for preparing th e biomass for conversion into a syng as. Furthermore, DOE researchers report that significant w ork remains to successfully gasify Biodiesel Biomass Gas-to-Liqu id Page 30 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion biomass feedstocks on a large en ough scale to d emonstrate commercial viability. In t he absence of these developments, DOE report ed that the costs of producing biom ass GTL will be very high and signifi cant uncertainty surrounding its ultimate commercial feasibility will exist. Coal gas-to-l iquid (coal GTL) is a fuel produced by gasifyin g coal into a syngas befor e being converted into a diesel-like f uel. This fuel is commercially produced outside the United States, but none of the production f acilities are considered profitable. D OE reported that high capital in vestments\u2014both in money and time\u2014deter the com mercial developmen t of coal GT L in the Unit ed States. S pecifical ly, DOE estimates that construction of a coal GTL conversion plant could cost u p to $3. 5 billion and would require at least 5 to 6 years to construct. Furthermore, potential investors are deterred from this investment because of the risks associated with the len gthy, un certain, and costly regulatory process required to build such a facility. An expert at DOE also expressed concer n that the infr astructure required to produce or transport coal may be insufficient. For example, the rail n etwork for tra nsporting western coal i s already op erating at full capacit y and, owing to sa fety and environmental concerns, there is signif icant uncertainty about th e feasibility of expanding the producti on capabiliti es of eastern coal mines. Coal GTL production also faces serious environmental con cerns becau se of the carbon dioxide emitted during producti on. To mitigate the effect of coal GT L productio n, researchers are consider ing options f or combining coal GTL p roduction with underground inject ion of sequestered carbo n dioxide to enhance oil recovery in aging oil fields. Natural gas i s an alternat ive fuel th at can be used as either a compressed natural gas or a liquefi ed natural gas . Natural ga s vehicles ar e currently availab le in t he United St ates, but their use is limited, and pro duction has declined in the past few years. Accor ding to DOE, large-scal e commercialization of nat ural gas veh icles is complicated b y the widespread availability and lower cost of gasoline and di esel fuels. Furthermore, demand f or natural gas in other markets, such as home heating and energy gene ration, prese nts substantial competiti ve risks to the natural gas vehicl e industry. Pr oduction costs for natural gas vehicl es are also high er than for c onventional vehicles b ecause of the i ncremental cost associated with a hi gh-pressure natural gas t ank. For exa mple, light- duty natural gas vehi cles can cost $ 1,500 to $6,000 more than comparable convention al vehicl es, while hea vy-duty natural gas vehicl es cost $30,0 00 to $50, 000 more than co mparable co nventional vehicles. Reg arding infrastructure, retrofitting refueling stations so that they can accommodate natural gas could cost from $100,000 to $1 million per Coal Gas-to-Liquid Natural Gas and Natural Gas Vehicles Page 31 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion station, dep ending on th e size, according to DOE. Although r efueling at home can be an option fo r some natural gas v ehicles, home refueling applianc es are estimated to cost appr oximately $ 2,000 each. Advanced vehicle t echn ologies that we considered includ ed lightweight materials and improvements to conv entional en gines that inc rease fuel economy, as well as hybrid vehicl es and plug-in h ybrid electri c vehi cles that use an electric motor/generator and a b attery pack in co njunction with an internal combustion engin e. Hybrid elect ric vehicl es are commercially av ailable in the United States, but t hese are not yet considered competitive with comparable con ventional vehi cles. DOE experts report that demand for such vehicles is p redicated on their cost- competitive ness with comparable co nventional vehicles. Hyb rid electric vehicles, for example, co st $2,00 0 to $3,500 more to buy than comparable convention al vehicl es and currently constitute around 1 percent of new vehicle regis trations in the United St ates. In addi tion, ele ctric batteries in hybrid elect ric vehicl es face te chnic al challen ges associated with their performance and reli ability when ex posed to ext reme temperatures or harsh automotive en vironments. Other advan ced vehicle tech nologies, including advanced dies el engin es and plug-in h ybrids, are (1) in the v ery early stages of commercial release or are not y et commercially av ailable and (2) face obstacles to large-scale commercialization. For e xample, advanc ed diesel engin es present an e nvironmental challen ge because, despite their high fuel efficiency , the y are not exp ected to me et future emission sta ndards. Fed eral researc hers are working to en able the en gine to burn more cle anly, bu t these effor ts are costly and fac e technical barriers. Plug-in hybrid e lectric v ehicles are not y et commercially fe asible because of cost, technica l, and infrast ructure fa t. For example, plug-in electric h ybrids cost much more to produce tha n conventi onal vehi cles, they requ ire significant upgrades to home electri cal systems to support thei r recharging, and researchers have yet to de velop a plug-in electric with a range of more than 40 miles on battery power alone. A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is powered by th e ele ctricity prod uced from an ele ctroch emical react ion betw een hydrogen fr om a hydrog en- containing f uel and ox ygen from th e air. In the U nited States, these vehicles are still in the d evelopment stage, and making these vehicles commercially feasible pr esents a nu mber of chal lenges. Whil e a convention al gas engi ne costs $2,00 0 to $3,0 00 to produce, the stack of hydrogen fu el cells need ed to power a vehi cle costs $35,000 t o produce. Furthermore, DOE researchers hav e yet to develop a metho d for feasibl y storing hydrogen in a vehicle that allows a range of at least 3 00 miles Advanced Vehicle Technologies Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles Page 32 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion before refue ling. Fuel cell vehicl es also are not y et able to last for 120, 000 miles, which DOE believes to be the target for co mmercial viability. In addition, developing an infrastructu re for distributing through pip elines or through trucki ng\u2014is costly, and t ime-consuming. Deliverin g hydroge n from a cent ral source requires a large amount of energy and is considered costly an d technicall y challen ging. DOE has determined that decentraliz ed producti on of hydrogen di rectly at filli ng stations could be a more viable approach than centralized production i n some cases, but a cost- effective mechanism for converting energy sourc es into hydr ogen at a fill ing station h as yet to b e develop ed. More detailed information on these t echnologi es is provided i n appendix IV. Because development an d widespread adoption o f technologi es to displace oil will take time and effort, an imminent peak and sharp decline in oil production could h ave severe consequences. The techn ologies we examined currently supply the equivalent of onl y about 1 p ercent of U.S. annual consumption of petroleum pr oducts, and DOE projects that even under optimistic scenari os, these te chnologies co uld displace only the equival ent o f about 4 p ercent of an nual projected U.S. consumption by around 2015. If the decli ne in oil pr oduction exceeded the ability of alternative t echnologi es to displace o il, energy co nsumption would be constricted, and as cons umers co mpeted for incr easingly sc arce oil resources, oil prices would sharpl y increase. In t his respect, t he consequen ces could init ially resemble those of p ast oil supply shocks, which have been associ ated with significant e conomic damage. For example, dis ruptions in oil supply asso ciated with the Arab oil embargo of 1973- 74 and the Iranian Revolution of 1978-79 caused unprecedented increases in oil prices an d were associated with worldwide recessions. In addition, a number of studies we revi ewed indica te that most of the U.S. recessions in the post-World War II era were preceded by oil supply shocks and t he associated sudden rise in oil prices. Ultimately, however, th e consequ ences of a p eak and perma nent declin e in oil producti on could be even more p rolonged an d severe than those of past oil supply shocks. Because th e decline woul d be neith er temporary nor reversible, the effect s would cont inue until al ternative tra nsportation technologi es to displace oil became availabl e in s ufficient qu antities at comparable costs. Furthermore, because oil pro duction coul d decline Consequences Could Be Severe If Alternati ve Technol ogies Are Not Available Page 33 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion even more e ach y ear foll owing a pea k, the amou nt that would have t o be replaced by alternatives could also in crease ye ar by ye ar. Consumer a ctions could help mitigat e the co nseq uences of a near-term peak and decline in oil production th rough demand-reducing behaviors such as carp ooling; tel eworking; and \"eco-drivi ng\" measures, such as proper tire inflation and slower dr iving speeds. C learly these energy savings come at some co st of conven ience and pr oductivity, and limited research has been don e to estimate potential fuel savings associated with such efforts. However, DOE estimate s that drivers could improve fuel economy between 7 and 23 percent b y not ex ceed ing speeds o f 60 miles per hour, an d IEA estimates that tel eworking co uld reduce t otal fuel consumption in the U.S. and Canadi an transportation sectors combined b y between 1 and 4 percent , dependin g on whether teleworking i s undertaken for 2 days p er week or the full 5-d ay week, respe ctively . If the peak occurs in the more distant future or the declin e fol lowing a peak is less severe, alt ernative t echnologies hav e a great er po tential to mitigate the consequen ces. DOE pro jects that th e alternati ve technologi es we examined have t he potential to di splace up to the equi valent of 34 percent of annual U.S. consumption of petroleu m products in the 2025 through 203 0 time frame. However, DOE also considers these projection s optimistic\u2014it assumes that sufficien t time and ef fort are dedi cated to th e developmen t of these technologies t o overcome the chall enges they face. More specifically, DOE a ssumes sustained hig h oil prices abo ve $50 per barrel as a d riving force. The lev el of effort dedic ated to ov ercoming challenges t o alternative technologi es will depend in part on the price of oil, with hig her oil price s creating in centives to d evelop alter natives. Hig h oil prices als o can spark consumer in terest in alte rnatives that consume less oil. For example, ne w purchases of light trucks, SUVs, and minivans declined in 2005 and 2 006, correspon ding to a p eriod of increa sing gasoline pri ces. Gasoline demand ha s also grown slower in 2005 and 2006\u20140 .95 and 1.43 perc ent, respecti vely\u2014compared with g decade , duri ng which ga soline demand grew at a n avera ge ra te of 1.8 1 percent. In t he past, high oil prices h ave signifi cantly affect ed oil consumption: U.S. cons umption of oil fell by about 18 p ercent from 1979 to 198 3, in p art because U.S. consumers purchased more fuel -efficient vehicles in response to h igh oil prices. While current high oil p rices may encourage d evelopment an d adoption o f alternatives to oil, if high oil prices ar e not sustained, efforts to develop and adopt alternatives may fall b y the wayside. T he high oil prices and fears of running out of o il in th e 1970s and early 1980s en couraged Page 34 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion investments in alternativ e energ y sources, includi ng synthetic fuels made from coal, but when oil prices fell, investments in these alter natives became uneconomic. More recently, privat e sect or interest in alternative fuels has increased, corr esponding t o the increase in oil prices, but uncertainty about future oil prices ca n be a b arrier to investment in risky alternative f uels project s. Recent po lling data als o indicate th at consumers' interest in fuel effici ency tends to incr ease as g asoline prices rise and dec rease when gasoline pri ces fall. Federal agency efforts t hat could contribute to reducing uncertainty abo ut the timing of a peak in oil producti on or mitigating its consequences are spread acro ss multiple agencies and are gen erall y not focuse d explicitly on peak oil issues. Federal ag ency-sp onsored studies have expressed a growing con cern over th e potential for a peak, and officials f rom key agenci es have identifi ed options for reducing the uncertainty about the timing of a p eak in oil production an d mitigating its consequences. However, there is no strategy for coordinating o r prioritizing such efforts. Federal agencies have p rograms and act ivities that could b e directed to reduce uncertainty abou t the timing of a peak in oil producti on or to mitigate the consequen ces of such a peak. For ex ample, with regard to reducing un certainty, D OE provides information and an alysi s about glob al supply and d emand for oil and develo ps projections about fut ure trends. Specific ally, DOE's EIA regularly sur veys U.S. op erators to ga ther data about U.S. o il reserves and compiles reserves data for foreign countries from other sources. In addition, EIA prepares both a domestic and international energy outlook, which i ncludes proj ections for future oil supply and d emand. As previously discussed, USGS provides estimates of oil resources that have the potential to add to res erves in the United States. Interi or's Minerals Managemen t Service also assesses oil resources in the offsho re regions of the United States. In addition, several agen cies conduc t activiti es to encourage d evelopment of alternative technolo gies that coul d help mitigate the consequences of a decline i n oil production . For exam ple, DOE promotes devel opment of alternative f uels and ad vanced vehicl e technolo gies that coul d reduce oil consumption in the tran sportation sector by fun ding researc h and developmen t of new technologies. I n addition, USDA encourages developmen t of biomass-based alter native fu els, by collab orating with industry to identify and test the perfo rmance of potential bio mass feedstocks and conducti ng research to evalu ate the cost of pr oducing Federal Agencies Do Not Have a Coordinated Strategy to Address Peak Oil Issues Federal Agenci es Have Many Programs and Activities Related to Peak Oil Issues, but Peak Oil Generall y Is Not the Main Focus of These Efforts Page 35 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion biomass fuels. DOT provides funding to encourage development of bus fleets that ru n on alternat ive fuels, promote carpooling among consumers, and condu ct outreach and educatio n concerning telecommuting. In addition, DOT is responsible for se tting fuel econo my standards for automobiles and light tr ucks sold in the United States. While these and other pr ograms and activities co uld be used to reduce uncertainty about the ti ming of a peak in oil pro duction and mitigate its consequen ces, agen cy officials we spoke with acknowledged that most of these efforts are not expl icitly design ed to do so. For example, DOE's activities rel ated expli citly to peak oi l issues have been limited to conducting, commissioning, or partic ipating in st udies and workshops. Several f ederally sponsored studies we reviewed reflect a growing concer n about peak oil and ident ify a need fo r action. For example: Agencies Have Options to Reduce Uncertainty and Mitigate Consequences but Lack a Coordinated Strategy \u007f DOE has sp onsored two studies.24 A 2003 study hi ghlighted th e benefit of reducing the uncertainty surrounding the timing o f a peak to mitigate its potentially severe global economic consequences. A 2005 stu dy examined mitigating th e consequ ences of a p eak and con cluded the foll owing: \"Timely, aggressive mitigation initiati ves addressing both the supply and the demand sides of the i ssue will be required.\" \u007f While EIA's 2004 study o f the timing of peak oil estimates that a peak might occur closer to 205 0, EIA recog nized that ea rly preparati on was important because of th e long p eriod required f or widespre ad commercial production and adoptio n of new en ergy technol ogies.25 24David nd Jai Li, Runni ng Out Of and Into Oi l: Ana lyzing Global Oil De pletion and Transition Through 2050 , Oak Rid ge National La borato ry, Department of Energy (2003); and Robert L.

Currently, EIA's projections extend onl y to 2030, and officials believe that consideratio n of peak o il would require a l onger horizon. Also, the internati onal outlook is fairly limited, in part b ecause EIA no longer conducts its detailed For eign Energy Supply Assessment Prog ram. EIA is seeking to r estart this effort in fiscal year 2 007. In addition, U SGS official s told us that better and more complete information about glob al oil resources could be used to improve es timates by EIA of the timing of a peak. USGS officials said their estima tes of global oil resources could be improved or expanded i n the following four ways: \u007f Add informa tion to as \"frontier regions\"\u2014where little is about oil resources. \u007f Add informa tion on nonconventional resources outside the United States. USGS believes these resources will play a l arge role in future oil supply, and, therefo re, accurat e estimates of these resources should b e included i n any attempt s to determine the timin g of a p eak. \u007f Calculate reserves growth by country . USGS considers this information important because of th e political and investment condition s that differ by country and will affect future oil production and exploration. 26Donald F.

Page 37 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion \u007f Provide more complete i nformation for all major oil-producing countries. USGS noted that its assessment has some \"holes\" where resources in major-producing cou ntries have n ot yet be en esti mated completely. In addition t o these actio ns reducing the uncertai nty about th e timing of a peak, a gency officials al so told us that they coul d take a dditi onal steps to mitigate the consequen ces of a pe ak. For example, DOE officials reported that they could expand t heir efforts to encourag e the dev elopment of alternative f uels and ad vanced vehicl e technolo gies. ded by condu cting more de monstration s of new technologies, facilitating greater information shar ing among key industry pl ayers, and increasing cost share opportunities with industry for research and developmen t.27 Agency officials told us such efforts can be esse ntial to developin g and encoura ging the te chnologies. Although th ere are man y options to reduce the u ncertainty about the timing of a p eak or to mitigate its pot ential conse quences, according to DOE, there is no formal strategy to c oordinate an d prioritize federal programs and activiti es dealing with peak oil issues\u2014either within DOE or between DOE and other key a genci es. The prospect of a peak i n oil pr oduction presents problems of global proportion whose consequences w ill depend critically on our preparednes s. The consequences wo uld be most dire if a peak occurred soon, without warning, and were fol lowed by a s harp declin e in oil production because alternative energy sources, particularly for transportation, are not yet available in large q uantities. Such a peak woul d require sharp reductions in oil consu mption, and the competit ion for increasingly scarce en ergy woul d drive up prices, possibly to unprecedent ed levels, causing sever e economic d amage. Whil e these consequen ces would be felt globall y, the United States, as th e largest consumer of oil and on e of the nation s most heavily depen dent on oil for transportation, may be especially vulnerable amo ng the indus trialized nations of th e world. Conclus ions 27Experts we spoke with noted t hat it is im portant that the g overnment not choose one viable alternative techn ology t o the exclusion of a nothe r tec hnology . Page 38 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion In the long er term, there are many po ssible alternatives to usi ng oil, including us ing biofuels and improving automotive fuel effici ency, b ut these alternatives will require large investments, and in some cases, major changes in infrastructure or break-t hrough tech nological advances. In the past, the pri vate sector has responded to high er oil prices by investing in alternatives, and it is doi ng so now . Investment, however, is determined largely b y price exp ectat ions, so unless high oil prices are sustained, we cannot exp ect private i nvestment in al ternatives to continue at current levels. If a p eak were an ticipated, oil prices would rise, signal ing industry to increase e fforts to develop alternat ives and c onsumers of e nergy to conserve an d look for more energy- efficient prod ucts. Federal agencies have p rograms and activiti es that could b e directed toward reducing uncertainty about th e timing of a peak in oil production, and ag ency officials hav e stated the value in doing so. In add ition, ag ency efforts to stimulate the d evelopment and adoptio n of alternat ives to oil us e could be in creased if a p eak in oil production were deemed i mminent. While public and privat e responses to an anticipat ed peak coul d mitigate the consequ ences signifi cantly, f ederal agencies c urrently hav no coordinated or well-defined strategy either to redu ce uncertain ty about the timing of a p eak or to mitigate its co nsequenc es. This lack of a strategy makes it difficult to gauge the ap propria te level of effort or resources to commit to alternatives to oil and puts the nation u nnecessarily at risk. While uncer tainty about the timing of peak oil production is in evitable, reducing that uncertaint y could h elp energy users and suppliers, as well as government policymaker s, to act in ways that would mitigate t he potentially adverse cons equenc es. Therefore, we recommend that the Secretary of Energy take the lead, in coordination with other relevant agenci es, to prioritize federal ag ency efforts and establish a strategy for addressing peak oil issue s. At a minimum, such a strategy sho uld seek to do the follo wing: Recom mendation for Executive Action \u007f Monitor global supply and demand of oil with the intent of reducing uncertainty surrounding estimates of the timing o f peak oil pr oduction. This effort should includ e improving the information avail able to estimate the amount of oil, conventional and nonconventi onal, remain ing in the world as well as the futur e productio n and consu mption of this oil, while extending th e time horizon of the go vernment's projections and anal ysis. Page 39 GAO-07-283 tion \u007f alternative t echn ologies in light of predict ions about t he timing of peak oil pro duction and periodically advise Congress on likely cost- effectiv e are as where the government could assist the private sector with developmen t and adopti on of such t echnologi es. We provided the Depart ments of En ergy and the Interior with a draft of this report for their revi ew and comment. DOE generally agre ed with our message and reco mmendations and made several cl arifying and technical comments, whic h we addressed in the body of the report as ap propriate. A ppendix V contains a reproduction of DOE's letter and our det ailed respon se to their comments. S pecifical ly, DOE commented that the draft report did not make a distincti on between a peak in co nventional versus a peak in total (co nventional and nonconventi onal) oil. We agree th at we have not made this distinction, in part becaus e the numerous studies of peak oil t hat we revie wed did not always make such a dist inction. Furt hermore, we do not beli eve a clear distinction between thes e two peak c oncepts is p ossible, in part because the definitio n of what is convention al oil versus nonconventio nal oil is not universally a greed on. H owever, the information we have rep orted regarding un certainty about the timing of a p eak applies to ei ther peak oil concept. DOE also commented that our use of certain te chnical phrase s, including the distincti on between heavy and extra-heav y oils and the d istinction between oil consumption and demand, m ay be confusing to some readers, and we have made chan ges to the tex t to avoid su ch confusio n. DOE commented that the draf t report wrongly attribut ed environmental concerns to the use of enhanced oil recovery t echniques, stat ing that the environmental community prefers such t echni ques on existin g oil fields t o exploration and develop ment of new fields. We d o not disagr ee that th e environmental costs of th ese techni ques may be smaller than for other activities a nd we have added text to express DOE's views on this matter. However, our point in listing the c ost and en vironmental chall enges of enhanc ed oi l recovery techniques is that increasi ng oil produ ction in the future could be more co stly and mo re environme ntally dama ging than production of conventio nal oil, using primary production methods. For this reason we disagree with DOE's comment that we should remove the references t o environmental chall enges. Finally, DOE pointed o ut that the d raft report was primarily focused on transportation technolo gies that are used to power autonomous vehicles , Agency Comments and Our Evaluation Page 40 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion and they stated that a broader set of technologi es that could d isplace oil should be co nsidered. We agree with their characterization of the draft report. We chose transportation te chnologies because transp ortation accounts for such a large part of U.S. oil consumption and because DOE and other agencies have numerous p rograms and activiti es dealing with technologi es to displace oil in the transportation sector. We also agree that a broader set of technolo gies should be consider ed in the lo ng run as potential ways to mitigate the co nseq uences of a peak in oil production. We encoura ge DOE and other agen cies to fully e xplore the o ptions to displace oil as they implement our r ecommendations to dev elop a strate gy to reduce th e uncertaint y surrounding the timin g of a p eak i n oil production and advise Congress on cost-effective ways to mitigate the consequen ces. Interior gen erally a greed with our message and recommendations in the draft report and made cl arifying and technical co mments, which we addressed in the body of the report as appropriate. Appendix VI contains a reproduction of Interior' s letter and our detailed response to its comments. Specifically, Interior emphasize d that it has a major role to play in estimating global oil r esources, an d that this ef fort should be made in conjunction with the efforts of DOE. We agree an d encourage DOE to work in conjunction with Interior and other key agencies in establishing a strategy to c oordinate an d prioritize federal a genc y efforts to reduce th e uncertainty surrounding the timing o f a peak and to advise Co ngress on how best to mitigate con sequences. I nterior also commented that mitigating th e consequ ences of a p eak is outside their purvie w. We agree, and, in this r eport, we focus on exam ples of work that Interior could undertake t o assist in reducing the uncertainty s urrounding the estimates of global oil resources. As agreed with your offi ces, unless you publicly announce th e contents o f this report earlier, we plan no further distributio n of it until 30 days from the report date. At that t ime, we will send copies of this report to interested c ongressional committees, other Members of Congress, the Secretaries of Energy an d the Interio r, and other interested p arties. We also will make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov .

Jim Wells Director, Natural Resources and Envi ronment Page 42 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil cope and Method ology Appendix I: Scope and Methodology To examine estimates of when oil production coul d peak, we r eviewed key peak oil stu dies conducted by gover nment agen cies and oil i ndustry experts. We limited our review to tho se studies that were publ ished and excluded white papers or unpublished re search. For studies that we cited in this report, we reviewed their esti mate of the t iming, methodology, and assumptions about the resource base to ensure th at we properly represented the validit y and reliabilit y of their res ults and conclusions. We also consulted with fede ral government ag encies and oil c ompanies, as well as acad emic and research organi zations, to identify the uncertainties associated with the timing of a p eak. As part of our examination of the ti ming of peak oil production, we assessed other factors that could affect oil explor ation and pr oduction. Specific ally, we examined the ch allenges facin g future techn ologies that could enh the global production of oil, includ ing technol ogies for increasing r ecovery from conventio nal reserves as well as technologies f or producing n onconventio nal oil. To examine these technolo gies, we met with experts at the Dep artment of Energy's (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory, and synthesi zed information provided by these experts. In addition, we examined political and investment risks associated with global oil exploration an d productio n using Global Insight's Global Risk Service. F or each country, Global Ins ight's countr y risk analys t estimates the subjecti ve probabilit y of 15 discrete events for political risk, and 22 discrete ev ents for investment risk in the upstrea m oil and ga s sectors. The probability i s estimated for the next 5 years. Senio r analysts then meet to review the scores to ensure cross-country consistency. Th e summary score is derived by wei ghting diffe rent groups of factors and t hen summing across the groups. For political risk, ex ternal and in ternal political risks are the two groups of factors. For investment risk in the oil and gas sect ors, the fact ors are: inve stment/main tenance risk, input risk, production risk, sales risk, and reven ue/repatriati on risk. We compared political an d investment risk with Oil and Gas Journal oil reserves estimates. Oil and Gas Journal reserves estimates are limited by the f act that they are not indepen dently verified by th e publishers and are based on surveys filled out by the countries. Because most countries d o not reassess annually, some estimates in this survey do not change each year. We divided the countries into risk categories of low, medium, and high on th e basis of quartiles and nat ural break p oints in the data. To obt ain the percentage of reserves held by public companies and by nati onal oil companies, we used the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly list o f top 50 companies worldwide. The Petroleum Intelligen ce Weekly data are limited Page 43 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix I: S cope and Method ology by reliance on company reports and ot her information sources provided by compani es and the generation of estimates for those companies that do not release r egular or co mplete repor ts. Esti mates were created for most of the state- owned oil companies in figure 9 of t his report. The limitations of these dat a reflect th e uncertainty i n estimates of the amount of oil in t he ground, and our report does not rely on precise estimates of oil reserves but rather o n the uncertainty about the amount o f oil through out the world and the challenges to ex ploration an d productio n of oil. Therefore, we found these data to be sufficiently r eliable for th e purposes of our report. We also spo ke with offic ials at the S ecurities and Exchange C ommission and with DOE as well as experts in a cademia and industry. In addition, we reviewed do cuments from the Department of the Interior and the Internationa l Energy Age ncy (IEA). To assess the potential for transportation techno logies to mitigate th e consequen ces of a peak and decli ne in oil production, we examined options to develop alter native fu els and techno logies to red uce en ergy consumption in the tran sportation s ector. In par ticular, we f ocused on technologi es that would affect autom obiles and li ght trucks. We consulted with experts to devise a list of key technologies in these areas and then reviewed DOE programs and activiti es related to developi ng these technologi es. To assess alternative fu els and ad vanced vehicle technologi es, we met with various ex perts at DOE, including representatives from the National En ergy Te chno logy Lab oratory and the En ergy Laborat ory, and revi ewed information provided by officials from various o ffices at DOE. In addition, we spoke with officials from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Department of Transportation r egard ing the d evelopment of these technologi es in the United States. We did not attempt to comp rehensively list all techn ologies or to conduc t a governmentwide review o f all programs, and we limited our scope to what gov ernment officials at ke y federal agen cies know about the stat us of these technologi es in the United States. In ad dition, we di d not condu ct a glob al assessment of transportation technolo gies. We reviewed numerous studies on the relationship between oil and the glob al economy and, in p articular, on the experiences of past oil price shocks. To identify f ederal go vernment activi ties that cou ld address peak oil production i ssues, we sp oke with officials at DOE and the Uni ted States Geological S urvey (USGS), and gath ered information on fed eral progra ms and polici es that could affect uncertai nty about th e timing of p eak oil production and the d evelopment of alternative tr ansportation technologi es. To gain further insights into the fed eral role and other issues Page 44 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix I: S cope and Method ology surrounding peak oil production, we conven ed an expert pan el in Washington, D.C., in con junction with the Nation al Research Council of the National Academy of Scienc es. On May 5, 2 006, these e xperts commented on the poten tial economi c from conventional oil; fa ctors that co uld affect th e severity of the consequen ces; and what the federal role should be in prepari ng for or mitigating th e consequ ences, among other things. We recorde d and transcribed the meeting to ensure th at we accura tely c apture d the pan el members' statements.

Page 48 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K the Supply of ey Enha nce Oil Page 49 GAO-07-283 Appendix III: Key T echnologies to Enhance the Supply of Oil This append ix contains brief profiles of technol ogies that co uld enhan ce the future supply of oil. T his includes technologi es for (1) increasing the rate of recovery from proven oil rese rves using en hanced o il recovery ; (2) producing oi l from deepwater and ul tra-deepwat er reservoirs; and (3) producing n onconventio nal oil, such as oil sands and oil shale. For each technology, we provide a short description, followed by selected information on the key costs, potential productio n, readiness, key challen ges, and current federal invol vement. Although some of these technologi es are in prod uction or de velopment t hroughout t he world, the following profiles primarily focus on the develop ment of these technologi es in the United States. Enhanced oi l recovery (EOR) refers to the third stage of oil production, whereby sophisticated t echniqu es are used to recover remai ning oil fro m reservoirs that have otherwise b een exhausted through primary and secondary r ecovery methods. During EO R, heat (such as steam), gases (such as carbon dioxide (CO2)), or chemicals are i njected into the reservoir to improve fluid flow. Th ermal and gas injection te chniques account for almost all EOR activity i n the United States, with CO2 injection being the technique th at is currently attracting th e most commercial interest. In the United St ates, EOR methods are currently bei ng applied i n a variet y of regions, altho ugh most CO2 EOR occurs in the Permian Basin in Texas. Most EOR efforts in the United States are currentl y managed by small, independent oper ators. Globally, EOR has been introd uced in a number of countries, but North America is estimated to represent over h alf of all glob al EOR production. Key Costs Enhanced Oil Recovery \u007f Costs associated with EOR producti on vary b y reservoir, but reported marginal co sts for oil recovery using EOR can range from $1. 42 per b arrel to $30 p er barrel. \u007f Key capit al costs include new drills, reworking of existing dri lls, reconfigurin g gath ering systems, and modification of the inject ion plant and other su rface faci lities. Potential Production \u007f EOR currently contribut es approximately 12 percent to the U. S. production of oil. Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K ey Technologies to Enha Supply of Oil \u007f EOR is proje cted to in crease avera ge recovery rat es in reservoirs from 30 percent to 5 0 percent. \u007f Upper-end estimates of EOR's future recovery potential in the United States inclu de the follo wing: 1.0 mil lion barrels per day b y 2015 and 2. 5 million barrels per day by 2025. Readiness \u007f Thermal, gas, and chemi cal injection technologi es are currently commercially available. \u007f Key areas fo r further dev elopment ex ist, includin g sweep effi ciency and methods. Key \u007f Key chall enges facin g the dev elopment of EOR include the following: (1) a lack of indu stry-accepted, economical fluid injection systems; (2) a reliance on out-of-date practices and limit ed dat a due to l ack of familiarity with state-of-the-art imag ing and relu ctance to risk investment in technologi es; and (3) unwillingness on the part of some operators to assume the risks associated with EOR . Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f DOE is involved in several industr y consortia and individual programs, designed to develop EO R, including conducting research and developmen t and educati ng small producers abou t EOR. Deepwater drilling refers to offshore drilling for oil in depths of water between 1,000 and 5,000 feet, while ultra-deepwater drilling refers to offshore drilling in depths of wate r between 5,000 and 10,000 feet, according to DOE. The department reported that oil producti on at these depths invol ves a number of differen ces over shallow water drilling, such as drills that operate in extreme conditions, pipes that withstand deepwater o cean currents over long distances, a nd floating r igs as opposed to f ixed rigs. The primary r egion for domestic deepwater drilling is the Gulf of Mexico, where deepw ater drilling has become a major focus in recent years, particul arly as near- shore oil production in s hallow water has been declining. Globally, deepwa ter drilling occurs offshore in many locations, in cluding Afri ca, Asia, an d Latin America. Deepwater and Ultra- Deepwater Drilling Page 50 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K ey Technologies to Enha nce the Supply of Oil Key Costs \u007f Costs vary by rig type , but the three key compon ents of cost for deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling include the following: (1) the dai ly vessel rental rate, ( 2) materials, and (3) drilling services. \u007f The av erage market rate for Gulf of Mexico rigs can rang e from $210,0 00 per day to $300,000 p er day. \u007f Overall, the projected marginal costs of deepwat er drilling range from 3.0 to 4.5 times the cost of shallow water drilling. Potential Production \u007f Current deepwater production in the Gulf of Mexico is estimated at 1. 3 million barrels per day. \u007f Deepwater production i n the Gulf of Mexico is projected to exceed 2 million barrels per day i n the next 10 years. Readiness \u007f Commercial deepwater drilling at depths of more than 1, 000 f eet in the Gulf of Mexico has been under way since the mid- 1970s. \u007f Companies are currentl y exploring prospects for drilling in depths of more than 5,0 00 feet, and sinc e 2001, 11 discoveries of ultra-deepwater wells at depths of more than 7, 000 feet have been ann ounced. Key Challenges \u007f Examples of some of the key ch allen ges facin g the dev elopment of deepwater and ultra-deepwater drilling include t he following: (1) rig issues, such as finding ways to adapt and use lower-cost rigs and improving the ability to moor vessels in deepwat er; (2) drilling equipment reliability at high pressures and temp eratures; and (3) reduci ng the costs of drilling and producing at deepwa ter and ultra-deepwater depths. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f DOE is not directly involved in deep water and ul tra-deepwat er drilling, but it does fund projects that could impact such drilli ng. Page 51 GAO-07-283 Peak K ey Technologies to Enha nce the Supply of Oil \u007f The Energy Policy Act o f 2005 autho rized some funding for research and developmen t of alternati ve oil a nd ga s activities, i ncluding d eepwater drilling. Oil sands are deposits of bitumen, a t hick, sticky form of crude oil, which is so heavy and viscous t hat it will not flow unless heated or diluted with lighter hydr ocarbons. It must be rigorous ly treated to convert it into an upgraded cr ude oil befor e it can be u sed by refin eries to produce gasoline and diesel fu els. While co nventional crude flows naturally or is pumped from the ground, oil san ds must be mined or recovered \"in-situ,\" or in place. Durin g oil sands mining, approximately 2 tons of oil sands must be dug up, moved, and pro cessed to produce 1 barrel of oil. During in-situ recovery, heat, solvents, or gases ar e used to produce the oil from oil sands buried too deepl y to mine. The largest dep osit of oil sands globally is found in Alberta, Canada\u2014account ing for at least 85 percen t of the world's oil sands reserves\u2014although DOE reported that depo sits of oil sands can al so be found in the United States in A labama, Alaska, California, T exas, and Ut ah. Key Costs Oil Sands \u007f Commercial Canadian oi l sands ar e being produced at $18 to $22 p er barrel. \u007f Key infrastructure costs to support oil sands production in t he United States would include construction of roads, pipe lines, water, and energ y production f acilities. Potential Production \u007f The 2005 pr oduction of Canadian oil sands yielded 1.6 million barrels of oil per day and production i s projected t o grow to as much as 3.5 million barrels per day by 2030. \u007f Current U.S. production of oil sands currently yields less than 175, 000 barrels per year, and future production of U.S. oil sands will depend on the industry's investment decisions. Readiness \u007f Production of Canadian oil sands is currently in the commercial phase. Page 52 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K ey Technologies to Enha nce the Supply of Oil \u007f U.S. oil sand s production is only in th e demonstration phase, and adaptin g Canadian technologies t o the characteri stics of U.S. oil sands will require time. Key Challenges \u007f Examples of key ch allen ges facin g the dev elopment of oil san ds include the following: (1) ev aluating and alleviating envir onmental impacts, particularly concerning water consum ption; (2) accessing th e federal l ands on which most of the U.S. oil sands are locat ed; (3) addressing the increased demand on roads, schools, and other in frastructure that would result from the need to construct production facil ities in some remote areas of the west; and (4) addressing the incre ased need for n atural gas, electricity, and water for production. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f There are c urrently no fe deral progra ms to develop the U.S. oi l sands resource, alt hough the E nergy Policy Act of 2005 called for th e establishment of a number of polic ies and action s to encoura ge the developmen t of unconv entional oils i n the United States, incl uding oil sands. \u007f The Bureau of Land Man agement, which manages most of the federal lands where oil sands occur, maintai ns an oil san ds leasing pr ogram. Heavy a nd extra-heav y oils are dense , viscous oil s that gener ally require advanced pr oduction technologies, s uch as EOR, and substan tial processing to be con verted into petr oleum products. Heavy and extra- heavy oils di ffer in their viscosities and other phy sical properties, but advanc ed recovery t echniques like EOR are required for both types of oi l. Heavy and extra-heavy o il reserves occur in man y regions ar ound the world, with the Orinoco Oil Belt in Eastern Venez uela comprising almost 90 perc ent o f the total extra-heavy oil in the world. In the Unit ed States, heavy oil res erves are pri marily found in Alaska, California, and Wyoming, and some co mmercial heavy oil production is occurring domestically. Key Costs Heavy and Extra- Heavy Oils \u007f The cost of producing h eavy and extra-heavy oil is greater th an the cost of producing conventional oil, due to, among other things, higher drilling, refining, and transporting costs. Page 53 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K ey Technologies to Enha nce the Supply of Oil Potential Production \u007f The 2005 Venezuelan ext ra-heavy o il production was estimated to be 600,000 b arrels of oil per day an d is p rojected to at least sustain this production rate through 2030. \u007f In 200 4, pro duction of h eavy oil in C alifornia was 474,0 00 barrels per day . In December 2005, heavy oil product ion in Alaska was 42,500 barrels per day, but so me project Alaskan production to in crease to 100,000 barrels per day in 5 years. Readiness \u007f Extra-heavy oil producti on is in the commercial phase in Ven ezuela. \u007f Heavy oil production technologies ar e currently commercially avail able and employ ed in the Un ited States. Key Challenges \u007f Developmen t of the he avy oil resourc e in the Unit ed States fa ces environmental, economic, technical, permitting, and access-to-skilled- labor chall enges. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f There has n ot been a specific DOE program focused on hea vy oil, as most of the resear ch and d evelopments have been han dled under t he gen eral research umbrella for EOR. \u007f The Energy Policy Act o f 2005 call ed for an update of the 1987 techni cal and econ omic assessme nt of heav y oil resources in the United States. Oil shale refers to sedimentary rock that contain s solid bituminous materials that are released as petr oleum-like liquids when the rock is heated. T o obtain oil fro m oil shale, the shale must be heated and the resultant liquid must be captured, in a process referred to as \"retorting.\" Oil shale can be produced by minin g followed b y surface ret orting or by in-situ retorting. The l argest known oil shale depo sits in the world are in the Green Ri ver Formation, which covers portions of Colorado, Utah, an d Wyoming. Estimates of the oil resour ce in pl ace r ange from 1. 5 trillion to 1.8 trillion barrels, but not all of the resource is recoverable. In addition t o the Green Ri ver Formation, Australia and Morocc o are beli eved to hav e oil Oil Shale Page 54 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix III: K ey Technologies to Enha nce the Supply of Oil shale resources. At the p resent ti me, a RAND study reported there are economic and technical concerns as sociated with the develo pment of oil shale in the United State s, such that t here is unce rtainty regar ding whethe r industry will ultimately i nvest in co mmercial development of the resource. Key Costs \u007f On the basis of currently avail able inf ormation, oil shale ca nnot compete with conven tional oil pr oduction. \u007f At the present time, and given current technologi es and infor mation, Shel l Oil reports that it may b e able to produce oil shal e for $25 to $30 p er barrel. \u007f Infrastructure costs for oil shale production incl ude the following: additional electricity, water, and tran sportation needs. A RAND study expects a d edicated pow er plant for t he producti on of oil shale to exceed $1 billion. Potential Production \u007f The Green R iver Basin is believ ed to have th e pot ential to pro duce 3 million to 5 million barrels per day f or hundreds of years. \u007f Given the c urrent state of the techno logy and associated challenges, however, it i s possible that 10 years f rom now, the oil shale re source coul d be producing 0.5 million to 1.0 million barrels per day. Readiness \u007f Oil shale is not presently in the rese arch and d evelopment stage. \u007f Shell Oil has the most advanced conc ept for oil shale, an d it d oes not anticipate making a deci sion regarding whether t o attempt commercialization until 2010 . Key Challenges \u007f Examples of key ch allen ges facin g the dev elopment of oil shal e include the following: (1) controlling and moni toring groundwater, (2) permitting and emissions concerns associated with new power generati on facilities, (3) reducing overall op erating costs, (4) water con sumption, and (5) land disturbance and reclamation.

Page 56 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion A Consumption in Page 57 GAO-07-283 Appendix IV : Key T echnologies to Displace Oil Consumption in the T ransportation Sector This append ix contains brief profiles of key tech nologies that could displace U.S . oil consumption in the transportation sector. T hese technologi es include alternative fuel s to supplement or substitute for gasoline as well as advanced vehicle technologi es to increase fuel efficienc y. For each te chnology, on the basis of i nformation provided by federal exp erts, we provide a short d escription, f ollowed by selected information on the costs, potential pr oduction or displacemen t of oil, readiness, k ey ch allenges, and current federal in volvement. Although some of these technologies ar e in producti on or develo pment throughout the world, the following profiles primarily focus on t he develop ment of these technologi es in the United States. Ethanol is a grain alcoh ol-based, alt ernative fuel made by fer menting pla nt sugars. It can be made fr om many agr icultural products and f ood wastes if they cont ain sugar, starch, or cellulo se, which ca n then be f ermented and distilled into ethanol. Pure ethanol is rarely used for transportation; instead, it is usually mixed with gasoline. The most popular blend for light- duty vehi cles is E85, which is 85 p ercent ethanol and 15 perce nt gasoline. The technol ogy for prod ucing eth anol, at least from certain feedstocks, i s generall y well establishe d, and eth anol is currently produced i n many countries around the world. In Brazil, the world's largest prod ucer, ethano l is produced from sugar cane. In th e United States, more than 9 0 percent of ethanol is pr oduced fro m corn, but efforts are under way to develop methods for producing et hanol from ot her biomass materials, including forest trimmings and agricultural re sidues (cellul osic ethanol ). Currently, corn ethanol is primarily produced and used acros s the Midwe st. Key Costs Ethanol \u007f The current cost of producing eth anol from corn is between $0.90 to $1.25 per gallon, depending on the plant siz e, transportation cost for the corn, and the ty pe of fuel used to provide s team and ot her energy needs for the plant. \u007f The projected cost of producing eth anol from biomass is expected to drop significantly to about $1. 07 per gallo n by 2012. \u007f The current cost of producing of ethanol from biomass is not cost competitive, but by 2 012 it is projecte d to be abo ut $1.0 7 per g allon. \u007f Key infrastructure costs associated with ethanol include retr ofitting refueling sta tions to acc ommodate E85 (estimated K the Transporta tion Se ctor $100 ,000) and constructing or modify ing pipelin es to transport ethanol. Potential Production \u007f The 2005 pr oduction of ethanol in th e United States was approximately 4 billion gallons. By 2014- 15, corn ethanol production is expected to peak at approximately 9 billion t o 18 billion gallons annually. \u007f Assuming success with cellulosic over 60 billion gallons by 20 25-30. Readiness \u007f Corn ethano l is commercially produ ced today an d continues to expand rapidly. \u007f Cellulosic et hanol is in t he demonstrat ion phase, but it is projected to b e demonstrated by 20 10. Key Challenges \u007f For corn eth anol, ke y challenges in clude the n ecessary infrastructure changes to s upport ethanol distribution and the ability and willingness of consumers to adapt to ethanol. \u007f For cellulosic ethanol , several techni cal challenges still remain, including improving the enzymati c pretreatme nt, fermentation, and pr ocess integration. \u007f For cellulosic ethanol , economic chal lenges are h igh feedstock and production costs and the initial capital investment. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f The federal government is currently i nvolved i n numerous efforts to develop ethanol. Several federal agencies collab orate with industry to accel erate t he technol ogies, reduce the cost of t he technol ogies, and assist in develo ping the infrast ructure. Biodiesel is a renewable fuel that has similar prop erties to pet roleum diesel, but it can be prod uced from vegetabl e oils or animal fa ts. Like petroleum diesel, biodiesel operates in compression-ignition engines. Blends of up to 20 p ercent biodiesel (B20) can be used in nea rly all diesel Biodies el Page 58 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil K the Transporta tion Se ctor equipment a nd are comp atible with most storage and distrib ution equipment. These low-level blends generally do not require a ny engin e modifications. Higher ble nds and 10 0 percent biod iesel (B100) may be used in some engin es with little or n o modification, although transportation and stora ge of B10 0 requires spec ial managem ent. Biodies el is currently produced an d used as a transportation fuel aroun d the world. In the Unite d States, the biodiesel in dustry is small but growing rapidly, and refuelin g stations with biodiesel can be f ound across the country. Key Costs \u007f The current wholesale cost of pure biodiesel (B100) ranges fr om about $2.90 to $3.20 per gal lon, although recent sales h ave b een rep orted at $2.75 per gallon. \u007f To date, th ere has been l imited evalu ation of the projected in frastructure costs required for biodie sel. However, it is ackno wledged tha t there are infrastructure costs associated with i nstallation o f manufactu ring capa city, distribution, and blendi ng of the biod iesel. Potential Production \u007f In 2005, U.S. production of biodies el was 75 million gallons, and DOE projects abo ut 3.6 billio n gallons per year by 2015. \u007f Under a more speculati ve scenario r equiring maj or changes i n land use and price su pports, experts project it would be p ossible to produce 10 billion gallons of biodiesel per year. Readiness \u007f While biodiesel is commercially avail able, in man y ways it is still in developmen t and demon stration. Key areas of foc us for devel opment and demonstration include quality, warra nty coverage, and impact of air pollutant emissions and compatibility with advanced control systems. \u007f Experts project that, wit h adequ ate r esources, ke y remaining developmen ts could be r esolved in th e next 5 years. Key Challenges \u007f Initial capit al costs are significant and the tech nical le arning curve is steep, which deters many potential investors. Page 59 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix IV: K the Transporta tion Se ctor \u007f Economic challenges are significant for biodiesel. In the absence of the $1 per gallon excise tax, bi odiesel would not likely be cost-competitive. Current Fe deral Invol \u007f DOE l and autom obile industries in funding res earch and development efforts on biodiesel use, and USDA is conductin g research on feedstocks. Gas-to-liquid (GTL) alternatives include the production of liqui d fuels from a variet y of feedstocks, v ia the Fisher -Tropsch process. In the Fischer- Tropsch process, feedstocks such as coal a nd bi omass are converted int o a syngas, bef ore the gas i s converted into a diesel- like fuel. The diesel-like fuel is low in toxicity and is virtually interchangeable with co nventional diesel fuels. Although th ese technolo gies have been available in some form since the 1920s, and coal GTL was used heavil y by the German military during World War II, GTL technolo gies are not widely used to day. Currently, there is no co mmercial production of biomass GT L and the o nly commercial production of coal GTL occurs in So uth Africa, where the Sasol Corporation currently produces 150, 000 b arrels of fuel from coal per day. Extensi ve research and develop ment, however, is currently under way to further develop this technolo gy because automakers consider GTL fuels viable alternatives to oil without compromising fuel efficiency or requiring major infrastructure chan ges. Key Costs Coal and Biomass Gas-to-Liquids \u007f Coal. Construction of a p recommercial coal GTL plant is estimated at $1. 7 billion, while constructi on of a com mercial coal GTL is estimated at $3.5 billion. \u007f Biomass. Potential cost s associated with biomass GTL are uncertain, given th e early stage of t he technol ogy. \u007f Infrastructure costs associated wi th both biomass and coal GTLs are expected to be substantial, given th e necessary modifications to pipelines, refueling centers, and storage faciliti es. Potential Production \u007f Coal. Experts project tha t, at most, 80 ,000 b arrels per day coul d be produced by 2015 and 1.7 milli on barrels per day by 2030. Page 60 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil the Transporta tion Se ctor \u007f Biomass. Some experts project bio mass GTL to have th e potential to produce up t o approximately 1.4 milli on barrels-of-oil-equival ent per day by 20 30. Readiness \u007f Coal. Coal GTL is commercially avail able in Sout h Africa, but the technology has not yet been commercially adopted in the United States. \u007f Biomass. Biomass GTL is currently i n research a nd devel opment, nearin g the demonstration stage. Experts project that bi omass GTL production could be d emonstrated at the pilot s cale b y 2012. Key Challenges \u007f Coal. Key ch f acing coal chnology inte gration, for example int egrating various processes with combined cy cle turbine and CO2 capture operations, and market risk. \u007f Biomass. The chall enges are mostly technica l in nature, for e of i dentification i mproving cleanliness integration. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f Coal. DOE does not receive an y direct funding for coal GTL, b ut funding for other programs indirectly suppor ts and benef its some coal GTL research. \u007f Biomass. DOE funds so me biomass conversion research. Natural gas i s an alternat ive fuel th at can be used as either hea vy-duty compressed natural gas or liquefied natural gas t o power natural gas vehicles. Th ese vehi cles require pressurized tanks, which hav e been designed to withstand severe impact, high ext ernal temperatu res, and environmental exposure. Natural gas can be used by either ret rofitting an existing gas oline or dies el engin e or purchasing a natural gas vehicl e. Natural gas vehicles are in use in many countries , totaling mo re than 5 million natural gas vehi cles and over 9, 000 refueli ng stations. The United States has about 130,000 natural gas vehicles and 1,340 refuel ing stations. Natural Gas Page 61 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix IV: K Se Costs \u007f Light-duty n atural gas v ehicles es timated c ost additi onal $1 ,000 per vehicl e. \u007f Heavy-duty natural gas v ehicles are estimated to cost an addi tional $1 0,000 to $30, 000 per vehicl e. \u007f Natural gas refueling stations are estimated to co st $100, 000 t o $1 million to build, while home fuel ing appli ances cost approximately $2,000 per year. Potential Production \u007f Currently, natural gas vehicles disp lace approximately 65 million gallons of diesel fue l per year. \u007f There is a p otential nich e market in heavy- duty v ehicles for n atural gas, which could displace 1,500 million gallons of gaso line per year . Readiness \u007f Natural gas vehicles are commercially available n ow, but their overall use is limited on a nation al scale and pro duction has been declini ng in recent years. \u007f Heavy-duty natural gas v ehicles are in the final st ages of rese arch and developmen t. Key Challenges \u007f Examples of some key c halleng es fa cing the adoption of nat ural gas vehicles in clude the follo wing: (1) the higher cost of high-pressure fuel tanks for co nsumers, (2) the costly u pgrades to t he existing r efueling infrastructure, and (3) the availa bility and cost of natural gas. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f There is cur rently no fed eral funding or research focusing on n atural gas vehicles. Page 62 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil IV: K Transporta tion Se ctor Vehicle t echnologies enc ompass several different efforts to reduce vehicles' oil consumption. Increasin g the effi ciency of the internal combustion engine, spec ifically adva nced diesel engines, is c onsidered a first step toward other engine te chnologies. For example, researchers are working to improve the emissions profile of ad vanced diesel engines through techniques such as low-te mperature co mbustion, which would enable th e engine to bur n more clea nly so that e missions control at the tailpipe is less burdenso me. Another set of techn ologies are h ybrid electri c and plug-in hybrid elect ric vehicl es. Hybrid vehi cles use a b attery alongside th e internal combustion engine to fa cilitate the capt ure of braking en ergy as well as to provide p ropulsion, while plug-in hybrids use a different b attery and can be power ed by b attery alone for an extended period. Rese archers are examining h ow to build longer-lastin g and l ess- expensive b atteries for hybrid and p lug-in hybrid vehicl es. Finally, a range of ongoing work is attempting to improve the efficiency of co nventional vehicles. Fo r example, li ghtweight materials hav e the potenti al to improve efficiency b y reducing vehicle weigh t. Oil consumption can also be cut b y reducing the rolling resistance of tires, increasing the effici ency of transmissio n technolo gies that move the energy f rom the engi ne to the tires, and improving how power is managed within the ve hicle. Key Costs Advanced V ehicle Technol ogies \u007f Advanced not have inf ormation on the potenti al cost of this technology. Officials told us that thi s informatio n is proprietary. \u007f Hybrid electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. DOE officials told us that these vehi cles can cost s everal thous and dollars more than conventional vehicles, although some of the incremental cost in hybrid vehicles currently on the market may be relat ed to additio nal amenitie s, rather tha n the hybrid technology. \u007f Lightweight materials. DOE officials told us that lightweight carbon fiber materials currently cost approximate ly $12 to $15 per pound, and that their goal is to reduce thi s cost to $3 t o $5 per po und. Information was not availab le on costs associated with ot her technolo gies to improve convention al vehicl e efficiency . Potential Displacement of Oil \u007f DOE esti mates that the oil savings th at would result from its vehicle technology efforts, including research on internal combustion engines, hybrids, and other vehi cle effici ency measures, is 20,0 00 barrels per day b y Page 63 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix IV: K in the Transporta tion Se ctor 2010, up to 1.07 million b arrels per day by 2025. \u007f DOE wa s not able to estimate oil savi ngs for plug- in hybrids for fiscal year 2007 . Readiness \u007f Advanced di esel e ngines . Low-temperature combustion that would reduce the emissions burden of diesel engin es is under research and developmen t. \u007f Hybrid el ectric and plug-in hybrid e lectric vehi cles. Hybrid electric vehicles are currently on the market, although res earch contin ues on longer-lastin g, less expe nsive batteri es for both hybrid and pl ug-in hybrid electric vehicles. DOE's goal is to ha ve plug-i n hybrids commercially availab le by 2014 , althou gh officials considered this an aggress ive go al. \u007f Lightweight vehicle mat erials. Lightweight materials, such a s aluminum, magnesium, and polymer composites, have made inroads into vehicle manufacturing. However , research a nd devel opment are still under way on reducing the costs of these materials. By 201 2, DOE aims to make the lif e- cycle costs of glass- and carbon-fiber-reinforced composites, along with several othe r lightweight materials, comparable to the costs for convention al steel. Key Challenges \u007f Advanced di esel e ngines . Reducing t he emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter to meet go vernment require ments is a key ch alleng e for the diesel engine combustion process. Emission s reduction will help make more efficie nt advan ced diesel engin es cost-competitive with gasoline engines because it will reduce the cost and energy consumption of tailpipe emissions treatment. \u007f Hybrid el ectric and plug-in hybrid e lectric vehi cles. Battery cost is one of the central challeng es for hybrid elec tric and plug -in hybrid el ectric vehicles. DO E officials told us that th eir goal is to reduce th e cost of a battery pa ck for a hybrid electric vehicle from ap proximately $920 today to $500 by 2010. T echnol ogical challen ges include extending t he life of th e battery pack to last the li fe of the car, and improving power el ectronics in the vehi cle. Researchers are usin g lithium-ion and lithium polymer chemistries in the next generation of batteries, in stead of the current nickel metal hydride. Off icials told us that plug-in hybrids face infrastructure chall enges , such as the capacity of household electric wiring systems to recharge a pl ug-in, and the capa city of the electricity Page 64 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil tion Appendix IV: K the Transporta tion Se ctor grid if plug-i n hybrids are widely ado pted. Batter y lifetime an d cost are also challen ges for plug- in hybrids. \u007f Lightweight vehicles. The cost of lig htweight materials is the largest barrier to their widespread adoption. In addition, manufacturing cap acity for lightweight materials occurs prim arily in the aerospace in dustry and i s not avail able for producing automotive components for lightweight materials. Current Fe deral Invol vement \u007f Advanced di esel e ngines . currently condu cts research into combustion technology. For exampl e, federal fun ds are supporting fundamental research to unders tand low-temperature combustion technology, and the indu stry is atte mpting to establish the op erating parameters of an engine that f acilit ate low-temperature combustion. \u007f Hybrid DOE's FreedomCAR program sponsors research that s upports the development of hybrid vehicles, spe cifically with respect to improving the performance, an d reducing the cost, of ele ctric batteries . \u007f Lightweight vehicles. DOE currently funds research and d evelopment o n lightweight materials. A hydrogen fuel cell vehicle is powered by th e ele ctricity prod uced from an ele ctroch emical react ion betw een hydrogen fr om a hydrog en- containing f uel and ox ygen from the air. A fuel c ell power system has many components, the key one bein g the fuel cell \"stack,\" which is many thin, flat cell s layered together. Each cell produces energy an d the output of all of the cells is used to power a v ehicle.

In the Unite d States, government and industry are working on research an d demonstrati on efforts, to facilitat e the development and commercialization of hy drogen fuel cell v ehicles . Key Costs Hydrogen F uel Cell Vehicles \u007f Because hyd rogen fuel cells are still i n an earl y stage of d evelopment, the ultimate cost of hydrogen fuel cells is uncertain, but the go al is to make them competitive with g asoline-powered vehi cles. Page the Transporta tion Se ctor \u007f A fuel cell st ack currentl y costs abou t $35, 000, and a hydrog en fuel ce ll vehicle abou t $100 ,000. \u007f An ongoing cost-share ef fort between the federa l government and the industry is working toward price tar gets of $2 to $3 per gallo n of gasoline equival ent f or hydrogen at the refueli ng station. Potential Displacement of Oil \u007f Federal exp erts project that hydroge n fuel ce ll vehicles could have th e potential to displace 0.28 million barrels per day by 2025.

Page 69 GAO-07-283 Peak Oil Produc tion Appendix V: Co mme nts from th e Departme nt of Energy The following are GAO's comments on the Depart ment of Energy's letter dated Febru ary 7, 2007. 1. We agre e that we have not defined a peak as eith er a pea k in convention al or total oil \u2014conventio nal plus non convention al. In the course of ou r study, we found that ex perts conducting the tim ing of peak oil stu dies also do not agree on a single p eak concept . Different studies by these experts use different estimates for oil remaining and, as a result, i mplicitly ha ve different concepts of a peak\u2014a convention al versus a tot al oil pe ak. We hav e added langu age to the report to cla rify this point. The la ck of agreement on a pe ak co ncept mirro rs the disagreement about the very definitio n of convent ional oil versus nonconventional oil. The disti nction regar ding what p ortion of heavy oil is convention al is debated by experts. For example, USGS would consider the heavy oil produc ed in Califor nia as con ventional oil, while IEA would not\u2014the latter considers all heavy (and extra- heavy) oil to be noncon ventional. Fo r the purposes of this report, we have adopted IEA's definition of no nconvention al oil, which includes all heavy oil. GAO Comments 2. We agre e that the use of heav y and extra-heav y oil may be co nfusing in sections of this report, and we have i mplemented some of the suggestions that DOE provided in th eir technic al comments. 3. With regard to the inclus ion of some ethanol in p etroleum consumption as reported on page 1 of the report , we asked E IA staff to identify how much of such nonpetro leum liquids are in the fi gure. They told us that j ust under one-third of 1 percent of t he world petroleum consumption data they r eport is comprised of eth anol, and we noted this in a foot note on page 1 of th e report. We decided to conti nue to call it petrol eum consumption, rather than \"liqu ids consump tion\" as suggested b y DOE beca use the former is what EIA calls it an d because the nonpetr oleum component is so small. 4. We agre e that our langu age re gardin g the use of oil consumption and oil demand i s confusing i n some sect ions of the re port. Overall , the report makes the point t hat, all oth er things equa l, the faster t he world consumes oil, the sooner we will us e up the oil an d reach a peak. The report also makes the point that fu ture demand for oil, which depends on many factors, including world economic growth, will determine just how fast we consume oil. We have made some changes to the t ext to clarify when we are talki ng about consumption o f oil and wh en we are talking about the demand for oil.

We do not di sagree that t he environmental costs o f EOR are lower than for some of the oth er technologi es examined , and we did not try to rank the e nvironmental costs of all the alternati ves we exa mined. However, we belie ve th at these costs are relev ant for assessing the potential impacts of pro ducing more of our oil using such technologi es. Therefore, we left that discussion in the report but added langua ge att ributing DOE's views on this. 6. We agre e with DOE's assessment that there is a br oader range of transportation technolo gies besides those used to power autonomous vehicles. We chose to fo cus on the t echnologi es that experts currently believe have the most potential for reducing oil consumption in the light-duty v ehicle sector, which acco unts for 60 p of the transportation sector's consumpti on of petroleu m-based energy. We encourag e DOE and othe r agenci es to consider th e full rang e of oil- displacing technologies as they implement our recommendations to develop a strategy to red uce uncertai nty about th e timing of a peak in oil producti on and ad vise Congress on cost-effective ways t o mitigate the consequ ences of suc h a pea k.

We agree that DOE and Interior will both play a vital role in implementing our recommendation. We have made the appropriate wording cha nge to the Highlights pag e of the repo rt to clarify t hat our recommend ation is that DOE wo rk in conjunctio n with other key agenci es to establish a strategy to coordinate and prioritize federal agency effor ts to reduce the uncertai nty surrounding the timi ng of a peak and to advise Cong ress on how best to mitigate conse quences. GAO Comments 2. We agre e that mitigating the conseq uences of a peak is outsid e the purview of Interior. The examples cited highli ght the areas where Interior can help reduce the uncertai nty surrounding the estimates of global resou rces. We ha ve chan ged th e wording a ccordingly t o make this distinction clear.
